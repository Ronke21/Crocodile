<text>The Union of the Crowns (; ) was the accession of James VI of Scotland to the throne of the Kingdom of England as James I and the practical unification of some functions (such as overseas diplomacy) of the two separate realms under a single individual on 24 March 1603. It followed the death of James&#x27;s cousin, Elizabeth I of England, the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty.

The union was personal or dynastic, with the Crown of England and the Crown of Scotland remaining both distinct and separate despite James&#x27;s best efforts to create a new imperial throne. England and Scotland continued as two separate states sharing a monarch, who directed their domestic and foreign policies, along with Ireland, until the Acts of Union of 1707 during the reign of the last Stuart monarch, Anne. However, there was a republican interregnum in the 1650s, during which the Tender of Union of Oliver Cromwell created the Commonwealth of England and Scotland which ended with the Stuart Restoration.

==Early unification==

In August 1503, James IV of Scotland married Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry VII of England, and the spirit of the new age was celebrated by the poet William Dunbar in &quot;The Thrissil and the Rois&quot;. The marriage was the outcome of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace, concluded the previous year, which, in theory, ended centuries of Anglo-Scottish war. The marriage brought Scotland&#x27;s Stuarts into England&#x27;s Tudor line of succession, despite the improbability of a Scottish prince acceding the English throne at the time. However, many on the English side were concerned by the dynastic implications of matrimony, including some Privy Councillors. In countering these fears Henry VII is reputed to have said:

The peace did not last in &quot;perpetuity&quot;; it was disturbed in 1513 when Henry VIII of England, who had succeeded his father four years before, declared war on France in the War of the League of Cambrai. In response France invoked the terms of the Auld Alliance, her ancient bond with Scotland. James duly invaded Northern England leading to the Battle of Flodden.

In the decades that followed, England repeatedly invaded Scotland, including burning its capital. By the middle of Henry&#x27;s reign, the problems of the royal succession, which seemed so unimportant in 1503, acquired ever larger dimensions, when the question of Tudor fertility or the lack thereof entered directly into the political arena. Margaret&#x27;s line was excluded from the English succession though during the reign of Elizabeth I, concerns were once again raised. In the last decade of her reign it was clear to all that James VI of Scotland, great-grandson of James IV and Margaret, was the only generally acceptable heir.

==Accession of James VI==

From 1601, in the last years of Elizabeth I&#x27;s life, certain English politicians, notably her chief minister, Sir Robert Cecil, maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. Cecil advised James not to press the matter of the succession upon the queen but simply to treat her with kindness and respect. The approach proved effective: &quot;I trust that you will not doubt&quot;, Elizabeth wrote to James, &quot;but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them you in grateful sort&quot;. In March 1603, with the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne. Strategic fortresses were put on alert, with London placed under guard. English agents including Thomas Chaloner were advising James in Edinburgh on forms of government. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March. Within eight hours, James was proclaimed king in London, with the news received without protest or disturbance.

On 5 April 1603, James left Edinburgh for London and promised to return every three years, which he failed to keep by returning only once, in 1617. He progressed slowly from town to town to arrive in the capital after Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral. Local lords received James with lavish hospitality along the route, and James&#x27;s new subjects flocked to see him and were relieved above all that the succession had triggered neither unrest nor invasion. As James entered London, he was mobbed. The crowds of people, one observer reported, were so great that &quot;they covered the beauty of the fields; and so greedy were they to behold the King that they injured and hurt one another&quot;. In June, James gave Tobias Matthew, Bishop of Durham, orders to travel north from London to meet Anne of Denmark, who was bringing Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth to Windsor Castle.

James and Anne&#x27;s English coronation took place on 25 July though the festivities had to be restricted because of an outbreak of the plague. A Royal Entry featuring elaborate allegories provided by dramatic poets such as Thomas Dekker and Ben Jonson was deferred until 15 March 1604, when all London turned out for the occasion: &quot;The streets seemed paved with men&quot;, wrote Dekker, &quot;Stalls instead of rich wares were set out with children, open casements filled up with women&quot;.

Whatever residual fears that many in England may have felt, James&#x27;s arrival aroused a mood of high expectation. The twilight years of Elizabeth had been a disappointment, and for a nation troubled for so many years by the question of succession, the new king was a family man who already had male heirs waiting in the wings. But James&#x27;s honeymoon was of very short duration, and his initial political actions were to do much to create the rather negative tone, which was to turn a successful Scottish king into a disappointing English one. The greatest and most obvious was the question of his exact status and title.

In his first speech to his southern assembly on 19 March 1604 James gave a clear statement of the royal manifesto:

Parliament may very well have rejected polygamy; but James&#x27;s ambitions were greeted with horror from the English parliament who feared the loss of the ancient and famous name of England. Legal objections were raised, with legal opinion at the time being that a union would end all established laws of both countries. For James, whose experience of parliaments was limited to the stage-managed and semi-feudal Scottish variety, the self-assurance – and obduracy – of the English version, which had long experience of upsetting monarchs, was an obvious shock. He decided to side-step the whole issue by unilaterally assuming the title of King of Great Britain by a &quot;Proclamation concerning the Kings Majesties Stile&quot; on 20 October 1604 announcing that he did &quot;assume to Our selfe by the cleerenesse of our Right, The Name and Stile of KING OF GREAT BRITTAINE, FRANCE AND IRELAND, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, &amp;c.&quot; . This only deepened the offence. Even in Scotland there was little real enthusiasm for the project, though the two parliaments were eventually prodded into taking the whole matter &#x27;under consideration&#x27;. Consider it they did for several years, never drawing the desired conclusion.

==Opposition==

In Scotland there were early signs that many saw the risk of the &quot;lesser being drawn by the greater&quot;, as Henry VII once predicted. An example before Scottish eyes was the case of Ireland, a kingdom in name, but since 1601, a subject nation in practice. The asymmetric relationship between Scotland and England had been evident for at least a decade. In 1589, the Spanish Armada shipwreck survivor Francisco de Cuellar sought refuge in Scotland, as he had heard the Scottish king &quot;protected all the Spaniards who reached his kingdom, clothed them, and gave them passages to Spain&quot;. However, following his six-month ordeal within the kingdom, he concluded &quot;the King of Scotland is nobody: nor does he possess the authority or position of a king: and he does not move a step, nor eat a mouthful, that is not by order of the Queen (Elizabeth I)&quot;.

John Russell, lawyer and writer, an initial enthusiast for &quot;the happie and blissed Unioun betuixt the tua ancienne realmes of Scotland and Ingland&quot; was later to warn James:

Those fears were echoed by the Scottish Parliament, whose members were telling the King that they were &quot;confident&quot; that his plans for an incorporating union would not prejudice the ancient laws and liberties of Scotland; for any such hurt would mean that &quot;it culd no more be a frie monarchie&quot;. James attempted to reassure his new English subjects that the new union would be much like that between England and Wales and that if Scotland should refuse, &quot;he would compel their assents, having a stronger party there than the opposite party of the mutineers&quot;.

===Commissions===

In October 1604 English and Scottish MP&#x27;s were appointed as commissioners to explore the creation of a perfect union. James closed the final session of his first parliament with a rebuke to his opponents in the House of Commons: &quot;Here all things suspected... He merits to be buried in the bottom of the sea that shall but think of separation, where God had made such a Union&quot;.

The Union Commission made some limited progress, on discrete issues such as hostile border laws, trade and citizenship. The borders were to become the &quot;middle shires&quot;. Free trade proved contentious, as did the issue of equal rights before the law. Fears were openly expressed in the Westminster Parliament that English jobs would be threatened by all the poor people of the realm of Scotland, who will &quot;draw near to the Sonn, and flocking hither in such Multitudes, that death and dearth is very probable to ensue&quot;. The exact status of the &quot;post nati&quot;, those born after the Union of March 1603, was not decided by Parliament but in the courts by &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; (1608), which extended property rights to all the King&#x27;s subjects in English common law and allowed them to bring cases before the courts.

===National animosity===
Scottish aristocrats and other placeseekers made their way to London to compete for high positions in government. In 1617, Sir Anthony Weldon wrote of the poverty of Scotland, as conceived by English courtiers:

A wounding observation came in the comedy &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;, a collaboration between Ben Jonson, George Chapman and John Marston. In enthusing over the good life to be had in the Colony of Virginia, it is observed:

Anti-English satires proliferated, and in 1609, the king had an act passed that promised the direst penalties against the writers of &quot;pasquillis, libellis, rymis, cockalanis, comedies and sicklyk occasiones whereby they slander and maligne and revile the estait and countrey of England...&quot;

In October 1605 Nicolò Molin, the Venetian ambassador in London, noted that &quot;the question of the Union will, I am assured, be dropped; for His Majesty is now well aware that nothing can be effected, both sides displaying such obstinacy that an accommodation is impossible; and so his Majesty is resolved to abandon the question for the present, in hope that time may consume the ill-humours&quot;.

==Symbols==

King James devised new coats of arms and a uniform coinage. The creation of a national flag proved contentious, designs acceptable to one side typically offending the other. James finally proclaimed the new Union Flag on 12 April 1606: Scots who saw in it a St George&#x27;s Cross superimposed upon a St Andrew&#x27;s Saltire sought to create their own &#x27;Scotch&#x27; design, which saw the reverse superimposition take place. (that design was used in Scotland until 1707). For years afterwards, vessels of the two nations continued to fly their respective &quot;flags&quot;, the royal proclamation notwithstanding. The Union Flag entered into common use only under Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate.

<doc id="721866" wikidata="Q8642" url="?curid=721866" title="Kankakee River">
<text>The Kankakee River is a tributary of the Illinois River, approximately long, in the Central Corn Belt Plains of northwestern Indiana and northeastern Illinois in the United States. At one time, the river drained one of the largest wetlands in North America and furnished a significant portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Significantly altered from its original channel, it flows through a primarily rural farming region of reclaimed cropland, south of Lake Michigan.

==Description==
The Kankakee rises in northwestern Indiana, approximately southwest of South Bend, Indiana. It flows in a straight channelized course, generally southwestward through rural northwestern Indiana, collecting the Yellow River from the south in Starke County, and passing the communities of South Center and English Lake. It forms the border between LaPorte, Porter, and Lake counties on the north and Starke, Jasper, and Newton counties on the south. The river curves westward and ceases to be channelized as it enters Kankakee County in northeastern Illinois. Approximately southeast of the city of Kankakee, it receives the Iroquois River from the south and turns sharply to the northwest for its lower . It joins the Des Plaines River from the south to form the Illinois River, approximately southwest of Chicago.

The Kankakee River Basin drains in northwest Indiana, in northeast Illinois, and about in southwest Lower Michigan. The Kankakee River heads near South Bend, then flows westward into Illinois, where it joins with the Des Plaines River to form the Illinois. The area of Lake County (Indiana) which originally drained to Lake Michigan but now drains by means of artificial diversion to the Illinois River is not considered to be part of the Kankakee River Basin study region. Although the Kankakee River basin includes portions of Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, the discussion below will focus on the Indiana portion of the basin.

===Kankakee Outwash and Lacustrine Plain===
The Kankakee Outwash and Lacustrine Plain, a large and poorly drained plain, comprises approximately the southern quarter of both Lake and Porter counties. It is the most recent of the three landscape regions to face the pressures of impending urbanization. Large portions of the area were once marshland associated with the meandering Kankakee River, which, for eight or nine months of the year, was flanked on both sides by wetlands. The marsh area was wide and contained water deep. The low marshland was broken by infrequent islands of sand blown into dunes. The sand islands were the sites of Indian encampments and later of pioneer homes. The Kankakee marsh was an effective barrier to early southerly exploration of both counties, but the area has been progressively drained by ditches constructed during the past 60 years.

===Landscape===
The Kankakee River Basin is a product of the Wisconsin Glacial Episode. It is a remnant of the glacial lakes that comprised the Lake Michigan lobe of the ice sheet. Landscape elements include 1) the nearly level plains of a ground moraine, 2) eolian (wind driven deposits) plains, 3) outwash deposits, 4) the central river basin and 5) end moraines forming the north, middle and southern borders. Local relief varies from along the Iroquois Moraine, up to on the Valparaiso Moraine. Deposits range from in the lower basin (western). The deepest deposits of are in the upper basin (eastern). Along the Valparaiso Moraine, deposits can reach thick.

Outwash deposits occur primarily along the northern border of the basin. The southern half of the Kankakee Basin, south of the main river channel, is characterized by the fine-grained sediments that are wind driven, forming a series of broad eolian sand dunes and ridges. These are of moderate height. lacustrine silts and clays are mixed with the various waterborne and wind driven deposits throughout the basin.

===Bedrock===
The bedrock underlying the Kankakee Basin is primarily of Silurian age. There are also strata from the Devonian, and Mississippian periods. The Silurian rocks are primarily dolomite and limestone. A major subterranean feature is the Kankakee Arch; it is an extension of the Cincinnati Arch. North of the arch, the strata dip towards Lake Michigan and the Michigan Basin. To the south, the strata dips southwest toward the Illinois Basin. Within the Kankakee Basin (Lake, Jasper, and Pulaski counties), the rock strata are nearly flat, being at the top of the arch.

===Current conditions===
The Advanced Hydrological Prediction Service contains current data for river depths.

Contrary to what may be shown in online mapping sites or GPS software, the bridge over the Kankakee River on State Line Road near the public ramp at the Indiana–Illinois state line is closed and partially dismantled. Some fishing maps and websites about the river may include road directions to the public ramp at the state line, with outdated information. The public ramp is located on the north side of the river, and with the bridge out, it is not accessible from the south side, from Illinois Route 114/Indiana State Road 10. As of September 7, 2008, the old iron bridge at the Indiana–Illinois state line often clears the water by only approximately , making it possible to pass beneath only in small boats, canoes, etc.

==History==

===Kankakee Torrent===

The Kankakee River was originally formed around 16,000 years ago by an event known as the Kankakee Torrent. A glacial lake resulting from meltwater from the Wisconsin glaciation breached the moraines (located in what is today northern Indiana) holding it in. The resultant flood created the bed of the Kankakee River and had even greater impact in what is today the state of Illinois.

===Grand Kankakee Marsh===
Up through the early 19th century, the river furnished an important water transportation route through the Illinois Country for both Native Americans and early European settlers, notably the French fur trappers. The headwaters of the river near present-day South Bend allowed a portage to the St. Joseph River, which drains into Lake Michigan, as well as furnishing a subsequent portage to the Lake Erie watershed. The Kankakee, thus, was part of an inland canoe route connecting the Great Lakes to the Illinois River and subsequently to the Mississippi River.
Until the end of the 19th century, the river was nearly long, flowing in a highly meandering course through a vast complex of wetlands surrounding the river, that was known as the Grand Kankakee Marsh. Encompassing , it was one of the largest marsh wetlands in the United States.

===LaPorte and Starke county line===
Today, the Kankakee essentially forms the county line between LaPorte and Starke counties. However, when the two counties were originally proposed, Starke County&#x27;s borders were such that the river divided the county and effectively isolated the north-west portion. In order to reach the rest of the county, it was necessary for residents in this area to travel some distance east to Lemon&#x27;s bridge, before making the journey south. These residents petitioned the state to be annexed by LaPorte County, and this was done on January 28, 1842. The area of land relinquished by Starke County became the townships of Cass, Dewey, Hanna, and Prairie in LaPorte County.

===Draining the riverine wetland===
Beginning in the mid-19th century, much of the basin of wetlands was drained to create cultivated cropland. Two large ditches were constructed in 1858, as part of the Swamp Act of 1852, the first attempt to drain the marsh. A lobby grew among the large landholders in Lake County who advocated the complete drainage of the marsh, but due to the American Civil War and the subsequent economic downturn, little action occurred until the 1880s. In 1884, meetings were held by land owners in South Bend to discuss the drainage of the marsh. Two of the largest landholders agreed to build a network of drainage ditches in their lands to begin draining the eastern edge of the marsh. State funding was granted to the project during the term of Indiana Governor Claude Matthews and the project was expanded to include the entire marsh. At the time, it was heralded as a great advance for the state which was also in the process of draining the Great Black Swamp. By 1910, most of the marshlands were drained and work on rerouting the Kankakee River began. In 1917, the river was dredged to make it significantly deeper; by 1922, the process was mostly completed and the river was several miles shorter than its original course.

The upper river was also highly channelized with levees to allow easier transport of cut timber from the wetlands to saw mills downstream in Illinois. The channelization aided in the desiccation of the surrounding wetlands and reduced the river to less than half of its original length. Of the original marsh, only remain, comprising approximately one percent of the original area. The channelization of the river has rendered it especially prone to flooding. Starting in the 1980s, federal and state efforts have attempted to restore part of the original floodplain of the river through strategic widening of the levees.

===Today===
The river remains a popular destination for recreational canoeing and fishing for warm-water species. Kankakee River State Park is located along the river, northwest of Kankakee, Illinois. The Kankakee Fish and Wildlife Area is located in Indiana.

==Route==

===St. Joseph County (South Bend)===
The headwaters of the Kankakee River is southwest of downtown South Bend, Indiana, within the city limits. An area of wetlands and springs to the northwest of the South Bend Ethanol Plant is the start of the Kankakee River. An old Indian portage, about long, stretched from this area towards the northeast to what are today Highland and Riverview cemeteries, along what were once the banks of the St. Joseph River, but now forms a bank of Pinhook Park Lagoon. The St. Joseph River drains into Lake Michigan. The famous Council Oak Tree stood along this portage about from the St. Joseph River. Farms fields cover what was once a marshland.
The river has been &quot;ditched&quot; and is called Dixon West Place Ditch. Below Crumstown, Geyer Ditch joins it from the north, flowing out of Berrien County in southern Michigan.

===LaPorte and Starke counties===
The Kankakee River passes through the southeast corner of Starke County. Here it takes on a more natural appearance with wetlands spreading out along both sides of the river. The river channels form the northern border between Starke County and LaPorte County to its north. These are some of the more extensive wetlands along the upper river. The Kankakee Fish and Wildlife Area is a state managed wildlife area, heavily managed to control water levels throughout the year. Here, the Yellow River (the second largest branch of the Kankakee) joins the main river.

===Porter County===
The Kankakee River also forms the southern boundary of Porter County, delimiting an area of farm land and wetland forest. Throughout this area, the Kankakee is also called the Marble Power Ditch. This is the heart of the Grand Kankakee Marsh, which was drained in the early 20th century.

The earliest recorded crossing of the Kankakee was at Baum&#x27;s Bridge, on South Baum&#x27;s Bridge Road (Porter County) to CR 200 W (Jasper County). The other historic crossing between Porter County and Jasper County is Dunn&#x27;s Bridge, further east; CR 500 E (Porter County) to CR 400 E (Jasper County).

===Jasper County===
Jasper County is south of the Kankakee River and dotted with sand hills and wetlands. Much of the area has been drained to create farmland, but numerous conservation areas have been established along the river&#x27;s borders, such as the &quot;Aukiki Wetland Conservation Area&quot; and the surrounding &quot;NIPSCO Savanna&quot;.

===Lake and Newton counties===
The Kankakee River forms the border between Lake County to the north and Newton County on the south. Along this section of the river, the channel has been straightened, passing between Shelby on the north and Thayer on the south. The LaSalle Fish and Wildlife Area dominates both sides of the river, as it makes its exit from Indiana and enters Illinois.

===Kankakee County===
Entering Illinois, the river returns to its natural channel, winding its way to Momence, Illinois. This is the last section of the Grand Kankakee Marsh that has never been ditched. It is at Momence that the river crosses a limestone shelf, referred to as the Momence Dam. This natural feature&#x27;s resistance to erosion created a blockage in the flow of the Kankakee River, backing up water and thereby creating the Grand Marsh that once covered . The dam&#x27;s removal is part of the story of the draining the marsh.

Beyond Momence, the river takes on a more traditional image, flowing across the rolling hills of Kankakee County.

===Will County===
The river enters Will County, Illinois, through the City of Wilmington before joining the Des Plaines River. Here, in the Des Plaines Fish and Wildlife Area, the two rivers form the Illinois River for the journey to the Mississippi River.

==Political entities==

===Indiana===
Because of the river&#x27;s wide valley and historic great marsh, there are few towns on the river throughout the entire length of Indiana. Most towns are located either north or south, on high ground, just outside the marshes. Today, the marshes have been drained and it is not apparent why the towns are so far from the river.

<text>Cynthia Rylant (born June 6, 1954) is an American author and librarian. She has written more than 100 children&#x27;s books, including works of fiction (picture books, short stories and novels), nonfiction, and poetry. Several of her books have won awards, including her novel &quot;Missing May&quot;, which won the 1993 Newbery Medal, and &quot;A Fine White Dust&quot;, which was a 1987 Newbery Honor book. Two of her books are Caldecott Honor Books.

== Early life ==
Rylant was born in Hopewell, West Virginia, the daughter of a U.S. Army veteran, John Tune Smith, and Leatrel Smith &quot;née&quot; Rylant. Rylant uses her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her pen name. She spent her first four years in Illinois. Her parents separated when she was four years old, and she was sent to live with her mother&#x27;s parents in Cool Ridge, West Virginia, while her mother attended nursing school and was able to visit her only a few times a year. Growing up in the Appalachian region of the U.S. during the 1960s, Rylant lived in a very depressed economic environment. Her grandparents, extended family and kind local townspeople provided a nurturing, safe environment, while the little girl &quot;waited ... until someone could return for me&quot;, but they were very poor and lived a rustic life, with no electricity, running water or automobiles. As a result, she never saw children&#x27;s books as a child, reading mainly comic books and enjoying the outdoors.

Four years later, she moved back with her mother, who had relocated to nearby Beaver, West Virginia. There had been no libraries or bookstores in Cool Ridge, and there were none in Beaver. Rylant never saw her father again, and he died when she was thirteen years old in 1967. She later wrote, &quot;I did not have a chance to know him or to say goodbye to him, and that is all the loss I needed to become a writer.&quot; When she was nine years old, Rylant fell in love with Paul McCartney and The Beatles. However, her West Virginia childhood was the major influence on her works, and many of them deal with life in the Appalachian region. As a teenager, Rylant became enchanted with Robert F. Kennedy, whom she met during his presidential campaign. She was deeply affected by his assassination. Also important to her emotional development was her relationship with a boy from school.

Rylant earned a B.A. degree from Morris Harvey College (now the University of Charleston) in 1975 and a M.A. degree from Marshall University in 1976, discovering and studying English literature and greatly enjoying her years in school. In 1977, she married Kevin Dolin. Unable to find a job in her field after completing college, she first worked as a waitress and later as a librarian at the Cabell County Public Library in Huntington, West Virginia, where she finally became acquainted with children&#x27;s books. She taught English part-time at Marshall University in 1979 and wrote her first book, &quot;When I Was Young in the Mountains&quot;, based on her experiences as a young child living in the country with her grandparents. The picture book, which Rylant later said took her an hour to complete, earned an American Book Award in 1982 and was a Caldecott Honor Book. Her marriage with Dolin ended in 1980, and she earned a Master&#x27;s degree in Library Science from Kent State University in 1981. She lived in Kent, Ohio, for many years, working as a librarian at the Cincinnati Public Library. She later moved to Akron, Ohio, and worked at the Akron Public Library while teaching English part-time at the University of Akron. During the early 1980s, she was married briefly to a professor at the University of Akron.

== Career and later years ==

Rylant followed her inaugural effort with six more picture books based on her childhood experiences. Her 1983 book, &quot;Miss Maggie&quot;, deals with themes of aging. Her first poetry collection, &quot;Waiting to Waltz: A Childhood&quot; (1984), was also autobiographical, based on both happy and sad events or on people she knew, drawing universal emotions from the incisive portraits. Rylant became interested in writing poetry when she read some poetry in college by David Huddle. She said of his &quot;Paper Boy&quot;, that the strong characters were &quot;People whose lives are hard but are proud of who and what they are.&quot; In 1985, Rylant decided to write full-time. Her first novel, &quot;A Blue-eyed Daisy&quot; (1985), describes a year in the life of a young girl, including such events as her first kiss and the funeral of a classmate, and her relationship with her father, who, like Rylant&#x27;s real-life grandfather, is injured in an accident and loses his job. Her 1986 book, &quot;The Relatives Came&quot;, describes how she slept on the floor when company visited. The same year, she published one of her most well-received books, &quot;A Fine White Dust&quot;. This young adult novel portrays a boy who becomes a disciple to a charismatic preacher, leaving his parents and friends. When the preacher runs off with a young woman, the boy, despite his feelings of betrayal, strengthens his faith in God and discovers a more realistic view of human nature. The book was named a Newbery Honor book.

In 1987, Rylant published the first of her popular &quot;Henry and Mudge&quot; series books, &quot;Henry and Mudge: The First Book&quot;. In this book for beginning readers, Henry, an only child, forms a deep attachment with a puppy who grows to be an enormous drooling dog, Mudge. When Mudge is lost, Henry is despondent, and when he is recovered, the two are overjoyed. Since then, she has published dozens more Henry and Mudge books, as well as picture books, books for older readers, including young adult novels and story collections, and collections of poetry. Her critically praised 2004 picture book, &quot;Long Night Moon&quot;, describes the different moons that Native American cultures use to mark the changing seasons. 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Van Gogh Cafe&quot; is one of the author&#x27;s favorites. Her books often deal with the joys and hardships of family life, with animals and the outdoors, especially in the Appalachian region, and her characters are often loners or people facing hardships. Her 1991 non-fiction picture book for older readers, &quot;Appalachia; The Voices of Sleeping Birds&quot;, is a vivid picture of life in Appalachia and the warmth of its people.

Rylant&#x27;s 1992 young adult novel, &quot;Missing May&quot;, is a touching story about a girl who lives with relatives after the death of her mother and who must comfort her uncle after the death of his beloved wife. Beginning in the early 1990s, Rylant has published several series designed for younger readers, including the Lighthouse Family, High-rise Private Eyes, and Everyday Books series, the last of which is a series for very young children that she illustrated herself. She also illustrated several of her other books, including the playful &quot;Dog Heaven&quot; (1995), about an ideal dog afterlife. Other poetry collections have been &quot;God Went to Beauty School&quot; (2003) and &quot;Boris&quot; (2005).

==Personal life==

For a period she was in a romantic relationship with Dav Pilkey, author of &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;. In 1993, Rylant relocated to Eugene, Oregon, with her son from her first marriage. In 2003, she moved to Portland, Oregon.

== Honors ==

Rylant has received a number of awards and honors for her work. &quot;A Fine White Dust&quot; (1987) won a Newbery Honor, and &quot;Missing May&quot; (1993) won a Newbery Medal. &quot;When I Was Young in the Mountains&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Relatives Came&quot; (1985) received Caldecott Honors. &quot;The Relatives Came&quot; and &quot;Appalachia: The Voices of Sleeping Birds&quot; (1991) are each Boston Globe/Horn Book Honor Books, as is &quot;Missing May&quot;, which deals with the loss of a loved one. &quot;A Kindness&quot; (1988), &quot;Soda Jerk&quot; (1990), and &quot;A Couple of Kooks and Other Stories about Love&quot; (1990) have each been named a &quot;Best Book of the Year for Young Adults&quot; by the American Library Association.

<doc id="721873" wikidata="Q2349947" url="?curid=721873" title="Christian monasticism">
<text>Christian monasticism is a religious way of life of Christians who live ascetic and typically cloistered lives that are dedicated to Christian worship. It began to develop early in the history of the Christian Church, modeled upon scriptural examples and ideals, including those in the Old Testament. It has come to be regulated by religious rules (e. g., the Rule of Saint Augustine, Anthony the Great, St Pachomius, the Rule of St Basil, the Rule of St Benedict) and, in modern times, the Canon law of the respective Christian denominations that have forms of monastic living. Those living the monastic life are known by the generic terms monks (men) and nuns (women). The word &quot;monk&quot; originated from the Greek (, &#x27;monk&#x27;), itself from () meaning &#x27;alone&#x27;.

Christian monks did not live in monasteries at first; rather, they began by living alone as solitaries, as the word might suggest. As more people took on the lives of monks, living alone in the wilderness, they started to come together and model themselves after the original monks nearby. Quickly, the monks formed communities to further their ability to observe an ascetic life. According to Christianity historian Robert Louis Wilken, &quot;By creating an alternate social structure within the Church they laid the foundations for one of the most enduring Christian institutions...&quot; Monastics generally dwell in a monastery, whether they live there in a community (cenobites), or in seclusion (recluses).

==Life for monks and nuns==

Monasticism, in all its varieties, involves withdrawal from society. Monastic life is distinct from the &quot;religious orders&quot; such as the friars, canons regular, clerks regular, and the more recent religious congregations. The latter involves a special work or aim, such as preaching, teaching, liberating captives, etc., which occupies a large place in their activities. While monks have variously labored, in every case this work is extrinsic to the essence of the monastic state. Monks and friars are two distinct roles. In the thirteenth century &quot;...new orders of friars were founded to teach the Christian faith,&quot; because monasteries had declined.

Both ways of living out the Christian life are regulated by the respective church law of those Christian denominations that recognize it (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Church, or the Lutheran Church). Christian monastic life does not always involve communal living with like-minded Christians. Christian monasticism has varied greatly in its external forms, but, broadly speaking, it has two main types: (a) the eremitical or secluded, (b) the cenobitical or city life. St. Anthony the Abbot may be called the founder of the first and St. Pachomius of the second. 

A priest-monk is sometimes called a hieromonk.

==History==
===Biblical precedent===

First-century groups such as the Essenes and the Therapeutae followed lifestyles that could be seen as precursors to Christian monasticism. Early Christian monasticism drew its inspiration from the examples of the Prophet Elijah and John the Baptist, who both lived alone in the desert, and above all from the story of Jesus&#x27; time in solitary struggle with Satan in the desert, before his public ministry. Another monastic precedent in Bible would be Nazirites as they practiced tonsure, followed a certain diet as a form of fasting, lived consecrated lives and they followed a certain practice concerning hygiene. However, case of Nazirites is usually defined as a form of a historical Jewish vow or oath instead of being a direct precedent of monastic orders because of the historical context concerning Israelites and the importance of private rituals concerning vow making in historical Israelite religion.

===Early Christianity===
Early Christian ascetics have left no confirmed archaeological traces and only hints in the written record. Communities of virgins who had consecrated themselves to Christ are found at least as far back as the 2nd century. There were also individual ascetics, known as the &quot;devout&quot;, who usually lived not in the deserts but on the edge of inhabited places, still remaining in the world but practicing asceticism and striving for union with God. In ante-Nicene asceticism, a man would lead a single life, practice long and frequent fasts, abstain from meat and wine, and support himself, if he were able, by some small handicraft, keeping of what he earned only so much as was absolutely necessary for his own sustenance, and giving the rest to the poor.

An early form of &quot;proto-monasticism&quot; appeared as well in the 3rd century among Syriac Christians through the &quot;Sons of the covenant&quot; movement. Eastern Orthodoxy looks to Basil of Caesarea as a founding monastic legislator, as well to as the example of the Desert Fathers.

====Eremitic Monasticism====

Eremitic monasticism, or solitary monasticism, is characterized by a complete withdrawal from society. The word &#x27;eremitic&#x27; comes from the Greek word , which means desert. 
Paul the Hermit is the first Christian historically known to have been living as a monk. In the 3rd century, Anthony of Egypt (252–356) lived as a hermit in the desert and gradually gained followers who lived as hermits nearby but not in actual community with him. This type of monasticism is called &quot;eremitical&quot; or &quot;hermit-like&quot;.

Another option for becoming a solitary monastic was to become an anchorite. Those who wanted to live in monastic solitude but were unable to live alone could request that a bishop perform the rite of enclosure. An anchorite would live alone in a room that typically had a window that opened into a church so they could receive communion and participate in church services. There were two other windows that allowed food to be passed in and people to come to seek advice. The most well-known anchoress was Julian of Norwich who was born in England in 1342.

====Cenobitic monasticism====

While the earliest Desert Fathers lived as hermits, they were rarely completely isolated, but often lived in proximity to one another, and soon loose-knit communities began to form in such places as the Desert of Nitria and the Desert of Skete. Saint Macarius established individual groups of cells such as those at Kellia, founded in 338. These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only.

In 346 in Egypt, St Pachomius established the first cenobitic Christian monastery. At Tabenna in Upper Egypt, sometime around 323 AD, Pachomius decided to mold his disciples into a more organized community in which the monks lived in individual huts or rooms (&quot;cellula&quot; in Latin,) but worked, ate, and worshipped in shared space. The intention was to bring together individual ascetics who, although pious, did not, like Saint Anthony, have the physical ability or skills to live a solitary existence in the desert. This method of monastic organization is called &quot;cenobitic&quot; or &quot;communal&quot;. In Catholic theology, this community-based living is considered superior because of the obedience practiced and the accountability offered. The head of a monastery came to be known by the word for &quot;Father&quot;—in Syriac, &quot;Abba&quot;; in English, &quot;Abbot&quot;.

Guidelines for daily life were created, and separate monasteries were created for men and women. St Pachomius introduced a monastic Rule of cenobitic life, giving everyone the same food and attire. The monks of the monastery fulfilled the obediences assigned them for the common good of the monastery. Among the various obediences was copying books. St Pachomius considered that an obedience fulfilled with zeal was greater than fasting or prayer.

A Pachomian monastery was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The monks were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty monks. There would be thirty to forty houses in a monastery. There was an abbot over each monastery and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The monks were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division seem to have been employed, e.g., there was a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and Sundays, all the monks assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses.

Monasteries thus functioned as industrial communities in which almost every kind of trade was practised. Monks had ships of their own on the Nile to distribute their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and then bring back what the monasteries required

The community of Pachomius was so successful he was called upon to help organize others, and by one count by the time he died in 346 there were thought to be 3,000 such communities dotting Egypt, especially in the Thebaid. From there monasticism quickly spread out first to Palestine and the Judean Desert, Syria, North Africa and eventually the rest of the Roman Empire.

In 370, Basil the Great, monastic founder in Cappadocia, became bishop of Caesarea and wrote principles of ascetic life. Eastern monastic teachings were brought to the western church by Saint John Cassian (c. 360 – c. 435). As a young adult, he and his friend Germanus entered a monastery in Palestine, and then journeyed to Egypt to visit the eremitic groups in Nitria. Many years later, Cassian founded a monastery of monks and probably also one of nuns near Marseilles. He wrote two long works, the &quot;Institutes&quot; and &quot;Conferences&quot;. In these books, he provided a view of Christian monasticism that had a strongly evangelical and theological basis.

At the time of his conversion in Milan in the years 386–387, Augustine was aware of the life of Saint Anthony in the desert of Egypt. Upon his return to Africa as a Christian in the year 388, however, Augustine and a few Christian friends founded at Thagaste a lay community. They became cenobites in the countryside rather than in the desert.

Saint Benedict (c. 480 – 547 AD) lived for many years as a hermit in a cave near Subiaco, Italy. He was asked to be head over several monks who wished to change to the monastic style of Pachomius by living in the community. Between the years 530 and 560, he wrote the Rule of Saint Benedict as a guideline for monks living in community.

Some scholars attribute the rise of monasticism at this time to the immense changes in the church brought about by Constantine&#x27;s legalization of Christianity. The subsequent transformation of Christianity into the main Roman religion ended the position of Christians as a minority sect. In response, a new form of dedication was developed. 

=== Opposition ===

There were opponents of Monasticism in the early days of the church. Among the first opponents to Monasticism were Helvidius, Jovinian, Vigilantius and Aerius of Sebaste. Most of them were rebutted by Jerome, a priest and theologian who defended monastic and ascetic ideas. Monasticism was also opposed by some Arians.

==Eastern Christian monasticism==


Orthodox monasticism does not have religious orders as in the West, therefore there are no formal Monastic Rules (&quot;Regulae&quot;); rather, each monk and nun is encouraged to read all of the Holy Fathers and emulate their virtues. There is also no division between the &quot;active&quot; and &quot;contemplative&quot; life. Orthodox monastic life embraces both active and contemplative aspects.

Within the Eastern Orthodox Church, there exist three types of monasticism: eremitic, cenobitic, and the skete (see also lavra). The skete is a very small community, often of two or three (), under the direction of an Elder. They pray privately for most of the week, then come together on Sundays and Feast Days for communal prayer, thus combining aspects of both eremitic and coenobitic monasticism.

===Historical development===

Even before Saint Anthony the Great (the &quot;father of monasticism&quot;) went out into the desert, there were Christians who devoted their lives to ascetic discipline and striving to lead an evangelical life (i.e., in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel).
As monasticism spread in the East from the hermits living in the deserts of Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and on up into Asia Minor and beyond, the sayings (&quot;apophthegmata&quot;) and acts (&quot;praxeis&quot;) of the Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers came to be recorded and circulated, first among their fellow monastics and then among the laity as well.

Among these earliest recorded accounts was the &quot;Paradise,&quot; by Palladius of Galatia, Bishop of Helenopolis (also known as the &quot;Lausiac History&quot;, after the prefect Lausus, to whom it was addressed). Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (whose &quot;Life of Saint Anthony the Great&quot; set the pattern for monastic hagiography), Saint Jerome, and other anonymous compilers were also responsible for setting down very influential accounts. Also of great importance are the writings surrounding the communities founded by Saint Pachomius, the father of cenobiticism, and his disciple Saint Theodore, the founder of the skete form of monasticism.

Among the first to set forth precepts for the monastic life was Saint Basil the Great, a man from a professional family who was educated in Caesarea, Constantinople, and Athens. Saint Basil visited colonies of hermits in Palestine and Egypt but was most strongly impressed by the organized communities developed under the guidance of Saint Pachomius. Saint Basil&#x27;s ascetical writings set forth standards for well-disciplined community life and offered lessons in what became the ideal monastic virtue: humility.

Saint Basil wrote a series of guides for monastic life (the &quot;Lesser Asketikon&quot; the &quot;Greater Asketikon&quot; the &quot;Morals&quot;, etc.) which, while not &quot;Rules&quot; in the legalistic sense of later Western rules, provided firm indications of the importance of a single community of monks, living under the same roof, and under the guidance—and even discipline—of a strong abbot. His teachings set the model for Greek and Russian monasticism but had less influence in the Latin West.

Of great importance to the development of monasticism is the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. Here the Ladder of Divine Ascent was written by Saint John Climacus (c.600), a work of such importance that many Orthodox monasteries to this day read it publicly either during the Divine Services or in Trapeza during Great Lent.

At the height of the East Roman Empire, numerous great monasteries were established by the emperors, including the twenty &quot;sovereign monasteries&quot; on the Holy Mountain, an actual &quot;monastic republic&quot; wherein the entire country is devoted to bringing souls closer to God. In this milieu, the Philokalia was compiled.

As the Great Schism between East and West grew, conflict arose over misunderstandings about Hesychasm. Saint Gregory Palamas, bishop of Thessalonica, an experienced Athonite monk, defended Eastern Orthodox spirituality against the critiques of Barlaam of Calabria, and left numerous important works on the spiritual life.

===Present===

Candidates for the Office of Bishop in the Eastern Orthodox Church are still required by canon law to be unwed/widowed and to take monastic vows if they have not previously done so.

Monastic centers thrive to this day in Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Georgia, Greece, North Macedonia, Russia, Romania, Serbia, the Holy Land, and elsewhere. The Autonomous Monastic State of Mount Athos remains the spiritual center of monasticism for the Eastern Orthodox Church. 

Monasticism continues to be influential in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Fasting, Hesychasm, and spiritual life are strongly encouraged not only among monastics but also among the laity.

===Types of monks===
There are three levels of monasticism: the Rassophore, the Stavrophore, and the Schema-Monk (or Schema-Nun). Each of the three degrees represents an increased level of asceticism. In the early days of monasticism, there was only one level—the Great Schema—and even Saint Theodore the Studite argued against the establishment of intermediate grades, but nonetheless the consensus of the church has favored the development of three distinct levels.

When a candidate wishes to embrace the monastic life, he will enter the monastery of his choice as a guest and ask to be received by the Hegumen (Abbot). After a period of at least three days the Hegumen may at his discretion clothe the candidate as a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he or she would simply be given the &quot;Podraznik&quot;, belt and &quot;skoufos&quot;. 

After a period of about three years, the Hegumen may at his discretion tonsure the novice as a &quot;Rassophore&quot; monk, giving him the outer garment called the Rassa (Greek: &quot;Rason&quot;). A monk or nun may remain in this grade for the rest of his or her life, if they so choose. The Rite of Tonsure for the Rassophore refers to the grade as that of the &quot;Beginner.&quot; The Rassophore is also given a klobuk which he wears in church and on formal occasions. In addition, Rassophores will be given a prayer rope at their tonsure.

The next rank, &quot;Stavrophore&quot;, is the grade that most Russian monks remain all their lives. The title Stavrophore means &quot;cross-bearer&quot; because when Tonsured into this grade the monastic is given a cross to wear at all times. This cross is called a Paramand—a wooden cross attached by ribbons to a square cloth embroidered with the Instruments of the Passion and the words, &quot;I bear upon my body the marks of the Lord Jesus&quot; (). The Paramand is so-called because it is worn under the Mantle (Greek: &quot;Mandyas&quot;; Church Slavonic: &quot;Mantya&quot;), which is a long cape which completely covers the monk from neck to foot.
The highest rank of monasticism is the &quot;Great Schema&quot; (Greek: &quot;Megaloschemos&quot;; Church Slavonic: &quot;Schimnik&quot;). The &quot;Schema monk&quot; or &quot;Schema nun&quot; wears the same habit as the Rassophore, with the addition of the &quot;Analavos&quot; (Church Slavonic: &quot;Analav&quot;). The Analavos is a garment shaped like a cross, covering the shoulders and coming down to the knees (or lower) in the front and back. This garment is roughly reminiscent of the scapular worn by some Roman Catholic orders, but it is finely embroidered with the Cross and instruments of the Passion. The Klobuk worn by a Schema monk is also embroidered with a red cross and other symbols. the Klobuk may be shaped differently, more rounded at the top, in which case it is referred to as a &quot;koukoulion&quot;. 

The religious habit worn by Eastern Orthodox monastics is the same for both monks and nuns, except that the nuns wear an additional veil, called an &quot;apostolnik&quot;.

The central and unifying feature of Eastern Orthodox monasticism is Hesychasm, the practice of silence, and the concentrated saying of the Jesus Prayer. Monastic humility is guided towards preparing the heart for &quot;theoria&quot; or the &quot;divine vision&quot; that comes from the union of the soul with God.

==Western Christian monasticism==
===History===

The introduction of monasticism into the West may be dated from about A.D. 340 when St. Athanasius visited Rome accompanied by the two Egyptian monks Ammon and Isidore, disciples of St. Anthony. The publication of the &quot;Vita Antonii&quot; some years later and its translation into Latin spread the knowledge of Egyptian monachism widely and many were found in Italy to imitate the example thus set forth. The first Italian monks aimed at reproducing exactly what was done in Egypt and not a few—such as Saint Jerome, Rufinus, Paula, Eustochium and the two Melanias (Elder and Younger)—actually went to live in Egypt or Palestine as being better suited to monastic life than Italy.

The earliest phases of monasticism in Western Europe involved figures like Martin of Tours, who after serving in the Roman legions converted to Christianity and established a hermitage near Milan, then moved on to Poitiers where a community gathered around his hermitage. He was called to become Bishop of Tours in 372, where he established a monastery at Marmoutier on the opposite bank of the Loire, a few miles upstream from the city. His cell was a hut of wood, and round it his disciples, who soon numbered eighty, dwelt in caves and huts. His monastery was laid out as a colony of hermits rather than as a single integrated community. The type of life was simply the Antonian monachism of Egypt.

Honoratus of Marseilles was a wealthy Gallo-Roman aristocrat, who after a pilgrimage to Egypt, founded the Monastery of Lérins in 410, on an island lying off the modern city of Cannes. The monastery combined a community with isolated hermitages where older, spiritually-proven monks could live in isolation. Lérins became, in time, a center of monastic culture and learning, and many later monks and bishops would pass through Lérins in the early stages of their career. Honoratus was called to be Bishop of Arles.

John Cassian began his monastic career at a monastery in Palestine and Egypt around 385 to study monastic practice there. In Egypt, he had been attracted to the isolated life of hermits, which he considered the highest form of monasticism, yet the monasteries he founded were all organized monastic communities. About 415 he established two monasteries near Marseilles, one for men, one for women. In time these attracted a total of 5,000 monks and nuns. Most significant for the future development of monasticism were Cassian&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot;, which provided a guide for monastic life and his &quot;Conferences&quot;, a collection of spiritual reflections.

====Celtic monasticism====
It seems that the first Celtic monasteries were merely settlements where the Christians lived together—priests and laity, men, women, and children alike—as a kind of religious clan. According to James F. Kenney, every important church was a monastic establishment, with a small walled village of monks and nuns living under ecclesiastical discipline, and ministering to the people of the surrounding area. Monastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of Lérins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the Desert Fathers, with a monastic enclosure surrounding a collection of individual monastic cells. The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world. Illtud, David, Gildas, and Deiniol were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.

According to Thomas O&#x27;Loughlin, &quot;Each monastery should be seen, as with most monasteries of the period, as an individual response to the monastic impulse by someone who had experienced monasticism and then went off to establish either a hermitage to which others later came or a cenobitic community.&quot; The monasteries were organized on a family basis. Next in importance to the abbot was the scribe, in charge of the scriptorium, the teaching function of the monastery, and the keeping of the annals. The role of scribe was often a path to the position of abbot. Hereditary right and relationship to the abbot were factors influencing appointment to monastic offices.

Buildings would generally have been of wood, wattle, and thatch. Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Celtic monasticism was characterized by a rigorous asceticism and a love for learning.

Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the &quot;green martyrdom&quot;.

==== Double monasteries ====
The monastery of Brigit of Kildare at Kildare, Ireland, was a double monastery, with both men and women, supervised by an Abbess, a pattern found in other monastic foundations.

==== Scotland ====
Around 397, Ninian, a Briton probably from the area south of the Firth of Clyde, dedicated his church at Whithorn to St. Martin of Tours. According to Bede, Ninian evangelized the southern Picts.

Kentigern was an apostle of the British Kingdom of Strathclyde in the late 6th century and the founder and patron saint of the city of Glasgow. Due to anti-Christian sentiment, he re-located for a time to Wales, where he established a monastery at St. Asaph&#x27;s. Here he divided the monks into three groups. The unlettered was assigned to the duty of agriculture, the care of cattle, and the other necessary duties outside the monastery. He assigned 300 to duties within the cloister of the monastery, such as , preparing food, and building workshops. The remaining monks, who were lettered, he appointed to the celebration of divine service in church by day and by night.

==== Wales ====
Cadoc founded Llancarfan in the latter part of the fifth century. He received the religious habit from an Irish monk, St. Tathai, superior of a small community near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church, and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the &quot;Church of the Stags&quot;. There he also established a college and a hospital. His legend recounts that he daily fed a hundred clergy and a hundred soldiers, a hundred workmen, a hundred poor men, and the same number of widows. When thousands left the world and became monks, they very often did so as clansmen, dutifully following the example of their chief. Bishoprics, canonries, and parochial benefices passed from one to another member of the same family, and frequently from father to son. Their tribal character is a feature which Irish and Welsh monasteries had in common.

Illtyd spent the first part of his religious life as a disciple of Cadoc at Llancarfan. He founded the monastery at Llanilltyd Fawr. One of his students was Paul Aurelian, a key figure in Cornish monasticism. Gildas the Wise was also a student at Llanilltyd Fawr, as was Samson of Dol. Samson founded a monastery in an abandoned Roman fort near the river Severn and lived for a time the life of a hermit in a nearby cave before going to Brittany.

St David established his monastery on a promontory on the western sea, well placed to be a centre of Insular Christianity. His establishment became known for its austerity and holiness, more than as a centre of learning, although when King Alfred sought a scholar for his court, he summoned Asser of St David&#x27;s. Contemporary with David were Teilo, Cadoc, Padarn, Beuno and Tysilio among them.

==== Cornwall ====
Many early medieval settlements in the region were occupied by hermitage chapels which are often dedicated to St Michael as the conventional slayer of pagan demons, as at St Michael&#x27;s Mount.

==== Ireland ====

The earliest monastic settlements in Ireland emerged at the end of the fifth century. It was from Illtud and his colleagues that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. Enda of Aran is called the &quot;patriarch of Irish monasticism&quot;. A warrior prince of Oriel, upon the death of his betrothed he decided to study for the priesthood. He first joined St Ailbe at Emly, before traveling to Ninian&#x27;s Candida Casa in Scotland, where he was ordained. About 484 he established the first Irish monastery at Killeaney on Aran Mor. Finnian of Clonard is said to have studied under Cadoc at Llancarfan in Glamorganshire. Finnian of Moville studied under Colman of Dromore and Mochae of Noendrum, before he too went to Candida Casa.
Ireland was a rural society of chieftains living in the countryside. As in Wales, if a clan chieftain accepted Christianity so did those he ruled. Commonly, Irish monasteries were established by grants of land to an abbot or abbess who came from a local noble family. The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Successive abbots and abbesses were members of the founder&#x27;s family, a policy which kept the monastic lands under the jurisdiction of the family (and corresponded to Irish legal tradition, which only allowed the transfer of land within a family).
In Ireland, the abbot was often called &quot;coarb&quot;, a term designating the heir or successor of the founder.

The abbots of the principal monasteries— such as Clonard, Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Swords, etc.—were of the highest rank and held in the greatest esteem. They wielded great power and had vast influence. The abbot usually was only a presbyter, but in the large monasteries, there were one or more resident bishops who conferred orders and discharged the other functions of a bishop. The abbot was superior of the house, and all were subject to him.

The Irish rule was rigorous. The daily routine of monastic life was prayer, study, and manual labor. With regard to food, the rule was very strict. Only one meal a day, at 3 o&#x27;clock p.m., was allowed, except on Sundays and Feast days. Wednesdays and Fridays were fast days, except the interval between Easter and Whit Sunday. The food allowed was barley bread, milk, fish, and eggs. Flesh meat was not allowed except on great feasts.

In Ireland, a distinctive form of penance developed, where confession was made privately to a priest, under the seal of secrecy, and where penance was given privately and ordinarily performed privately as well. Penance was considered therapeutic rather than punitive. Certain handbooks were made, called &quot;penitentials&quot;, designed as a guide for confessors and as a means of regularising the penance given for each particular sin. According to Thomas Pollock Oakley, the penitential guides first developed in Wales, probably at St. David&#x27;s, and spread by missions to Ireland.

Irish monasticism maintained the model of a monastic community while, like John Cassian, marking the contemplative life of the hermit as the highest form of monasticism. Saints&#x27; lives frequently tell of monks (and abbots) departing some distance from the monastery to live in isolation from the community. Irish monastic rules specify a stern life of prayer and discipline in which prayer, poverty, and obedience are the central themes.

Irish monks learned Latin, the language of the Church. Thus they read Latin texts, both spiritual and secular. Subjects taught included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, arithmetic, chronology, the Holy Places, hymns, sermons, natural science, history and especially the interpretation of Sacred Scripture. In 544 AD, St Ciarán founded a monastery at Clonmacnoise, which became one of the most important centers of learning and religious life in Ireland. Contrary to common practice, the title of abbot which included the title &quot;Comarba of Saint Ciarán&quot; at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. In 557, St Brendan founded a monastery at Clonfert.

By the end of the seventh century, Irish monastic schools attracted students from England and Europe.

Irish monastic achievements of insular art, in illuminated manuscripts like the Book of Kells, high crosses, metalwork like the Ardagh Chalice and the Cross of Cong and manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art. The manuscripts were produced by and for monasteries, and evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops.

==== Culdees ====
The Culdees (,  &quot;Spouses of God&quot;) were members of ascetic Christian monastic and eremitical communities of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England in the Middle Ages. Appearing first in Ireland and subsequently in Scotland, attached to cathedral or collegiate churches, they lived in monastic fashion though not taking monastic vows.

==== Hiberno-Scottish mission ====
Irish monasticism spread widely, first to Scotland and Northern England, then to Gaul and Italy. Columba and his followers established monasteries at Bangor, on the northeastern coast of Ireland, at Iona, an island north-west of Scotland, and at Lindisfarne, which was founded by Aidan, an Irish monk from Iona, at the request of King Oswald of Northumbria. Abbots of Iona were normally appointed from the founders kin, with an abbot often naming his successor.

Columbanus, an abbot from a Leinster noble family, traveled to Gaul in the late 6th century with twelve companions. Columbanus and his followers spread the Irish model of monastic institutions to the continent. A whole series of new monastic foundations under Irish influence sprang up, starting with Columbanus&#x27;s foundations of Luxeuil and Fontaine-lès-Luxeuil and, sponsored by the Frankish King Childebert II. After Childebert&#x27;s death Columbanus traveled east to Metz, where Theudebert II allowed him to establish a new monastery among the semi-pagan Alemanni in what is now Switzerland. One of Columbanus&#x27;s followers founded the monastery of St. Gall on the shores of Lake Constance, while Columbanus continued onward across the Alps to the kingdom of the Lombards in Italy. There King Agilulf and his wife Theodolinda granted Columbanus land in the mountains between Genoa and Milan, where he established the monastery of Bobbio. From about 698 until the reign of Charlemagne in the 770s, the Hiberno-Scottish efforts in the Frankish Empire were continued by the Anglo-Saxon mission. The rule of St. Columbanus, which was originally followed in most of these monasteries, was eventually superseded by that of St. Benedict.

====Benedictine monasticism====
Benedict of Nursia is the most influential of Western monks and is called &quot;the Father of Western Monasticism&quot;. He was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at Subiaco, outside the city. He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of Monte Cassino around 520, between Rome and Naples. He established the Rule of St Benedict, adapting in part the earlier anonymous Rule of the Master (&quot;Regula magistri&quot;), which was written somewhere south of Rome around 500, and defined the activities of the monastery, its officers, and their responsibilities. By the ninth century, largely under the inspiration of the Emperor Charlemagne, Benedict&#x27;s Rule became the basic guide for Western monasticism.

While the Celtic monasteries had a stronger connection to the semi-eremitical tradition of Egypt via Lérins and Tours, Benedict and his followers were more influenced by the cenobitism of St Pachomius and Basil the Great. Early Benedictine monasteries were relatively small and consisted of an oratory, refectory, dormitory, scriptorium, guest accommodation, and out-buildings, a group of often quite separate rooms more reminiscent of a decent-sized Roman villa than a large medieval abbey. A monastery of about a dozen monks would have been normal during this period.

Medieval monastic life consisted of prayer, reading, and manual labor. Prayer was a monk&#x27;s first priority. Apart from prayer, monks performed a variety of tasks, such as preparing medicine, lettering, reading, and others. Also, these monks would work in the gardens and on the land. They might also spend time in the cloister, a covered colonnade around a courtyard, where they would pray or read. Some monasteries held a scriptorium where monks would write or copy books. 

The efficiency of Benedict&#x27;s cenobitic Rule in addition to the stability of the monasteries made them very productive. The monasteries were the central storehouses and producers of knowledge. Vikings started attacking Irish monasteries famous for learning in 793. One monk wrote about how he did not mind the bad weather one evening because it kept the Vikings from coming: &quot;Bitter is the wind tonight, it tosses the ocean&#x27;s white hair, I need not fear—as on a night of calm sea—the fierce raiders from Lochlann.&quot;

In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the growing pressure of monarchies and the nation-states undermined the wealth and power of the orders. Monasticism continued to play a role in Catholicism, but after the Protestant reformation many monasteries in Northern Europe were shut down and their assets seized.

===Military orders===
In the twelfth century, traditional monastic orders in Outremer evolved into military orders, initially for the purpose of defending pilgrims, although they later became larger military forces that played a key role in combating Muslim efforts at reconquest and propping up continued Christian rule in the region. These orders included the Knights Templar and the Hospitallers. In large part, the notion of military monasticism was popularised because of the advocacy of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church&#x27;s ends in the war were inadequate and that a group of dedicated warrior monks, who achieved spiritual merit and served God through waging war, was necessary. In his view, advancing the cause of Christendom was an end that justified means that might fall outside the bounds of just war. These orders largely declined with the loss of Outremer in the 1200s - except for the Teutonic Order, which transferred itself to the Baltic where it took up a major role in the Baltic Crusades.

===Western Christian orders in the modern era===
Many distinct monastic orders developed within Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Monastic communities in the West, broadly speaking, are organized into orders and congregations guided by a particular religious rule, most commonly the Rule of St Benedict. 

====Roman Catholicism====

* Benedictines, founded in 529 by Saint Benedict at Monte Cassino, stresses manual labor in a self-sufficient monastery. They are an order of independent monastic communities.
* Cluniacs, a branch of the Benedictines, at its height c.950-c.1130
* Camaldolese, a branch of the Benedictines, founded c.1000 Saint Romuald of Ravenna.
* Vallombrosans, a branch of the Benedictines, founded c. 1038 by Saint Gualberto Visdomini.
* Carthusians, also known as the Order of Saint Bruno, founded 1084 by Saint Bruno of Cologne. Open to both sexes; combines eremitical and cenobitic life.
* Cistercians, the Order of Cîteaux, sometimes referred to as the Order of Saint Bernard, founded in 1098 by Saint Robert of Molesme.
* Paulines, founded in Hungary in 1225 by Blessed Eusebius.
* Celestines, founded in 1244 and originally called Hermits of Saint Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites). Became known as Celestines after their founder was elected Pope and took the name Celestine V.
* Olivetans or the Order of Our Lady of Mount Olivet, a branch of the Benedictines, founded in 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei (born Giovanni Tolomei) along with two of his friends from the noble families of Siena, Patrizio Patrizi and Ambrogio Piccolomini.
* Bridgettines, founded in 1344 by Saint Bridget of Sweden.
* Hieronymites, founded in Spain in 1364, by an eremitical community formally known as the Order of Saint Jerome.
* Conceptionists, formally the Order of the Immaculate Conception, founded in 1484 by Saint Beatrice of Silva.
* Turchines, formally the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, founded in 1604 by Blessed Maria Vittoria De Fornari Strata
* Visitandines: the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, an order of women. Members of the order are also known as the Visitation Sisters. The Order was founded in 1610 by Saint Francis de Sales and Saint Jane Frances de Chantal in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, France.
* Trappists, a Cistercian reform, begun c. 1664.
* Monastic Brothers and Monastic Sisters of Bethlehem, who practice Carthusian spirituality and were founded in consequence of the influence on a small group of French pilgrims of the promulgation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven on November 1, 1950, in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, in Vatican City. The Monastic Sisters were founded in France, soon after the event, and the Monastic Brothers in 1976.

====Lutheran Church====
After the foundation of the Lutheran Churches, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as Amelungsborn Abbey near Negenborn and Loccum Abbey in Rehburg-Loccum) and convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.

Loccum Abbey and Amelungsborn Abbey have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries.
Since the 19th century, there has been a renewal in the monastic life among Protestants. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Catholic Church.

In 1947 Mother Basilea Schlink and Mother Martyria founded the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, in Darmstadt, Germany. This movement is largely considered Evangelical or Lutheran in its roots.

In 1948 Bavarian Lutheran pastor Walter Hümmer and his wife Hanna founded the Communität Christusbruderschaft Selbitz.

In 1958, men joined Father Arthur Kreinheder in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer and &quot;The Congregation of the Servants of Christ&quot; was established at St. Augustine&#x27;s House in Oxford, Michigan. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur. During the 35 years of its existence, over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur&#x27;s death in 1989, only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there are two permanent professed members and two long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden (Östanbäck Monastery) and in Germany the (Priory of St. Wigbert). 

In Germany, Communität Casteller Ring is a Lutheran Benedictine community for women. 

In 2011, an Augustinian religious order, the Priestly Society of St. Augustine (Societas Sacerdotalis Sancti Augustini) was established by the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church.

In Lutheran Sweden, religious life for women had been established by 1954, when Sister Marianne Nordström made her profession through contacts with The Order of the Holy Paraclete and Mother Margaret Cope (1886–1961) at St Hilda&#x27;s Priory, Whitby, Yorkshire.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was founded through the merger of three churches in 1988.

====Anglican Communion====

In England, John Wycliffe organized the Lollard Preacher Order (the &quot;Poor Priests&quot;) to promote his views, many of which resounded with those held by the later Protestant Reformers.

Monastic life in England came to an abrupt end with Dissolution of the Monasteries during the reign of King Henry VIII. The property and lands of the monasteries were confiscated and either retained by the King, sold to landowners, or given to loyal nobility. Monks and nuns were pensioned off and retired or some were forced to either flee for the continent or to abandon their vocations. For around 300 years, there were no monastic communities within any of the Anglican churches.

Shortly after the Oxford Movement began to advocate restoring catholic faith and practice to the Church of England (see Anglo-Catholicism), there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. Anglican priest John Henry Newman established a community of men at Littlemore near Oxford in the 1840s while he was vicar of Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore. From then forward, there have been many communities of monks, friars, sisters, and nuns established within the Anglican Communion. In 1848, Mother Priscilla Lydia Sellon founded the Anglican Sisters of Charity and became the first woman to take religious vows within the Anglican Communion since the Reformation. In October 1850 the first building specifically built for the purpose of housing an Anglican Sisterhood was consecrated at Abbeymere in Plymouth. It housed several schools for the destitute, a laundry, a printing press, and a soup kitchen. From the 1840s and throughout the following one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated in the UK and the United States, as well as in various countries of Africa, Asia, Canada, India and the Pacific.

Some Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called &quot;mixed life&quot;, a combination of a life of contemplative prayer with active service. Anglican religious life closely mirrors that of Roman Catholicism. Like Roman Catholic religious, Anglican religious also take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Religious communities live together under a common rule, reciting the Divine Office and celebrating the Eucharist daily.

In the early 20th century when the Anglo-Catholic movement was at its height, the Anglican Communion had hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion, most notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are, however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in religious communities around the world. While vocations remain few in some areas, Anglican religious communities are experiencing exponential growth in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

Around 1964, Reuben Archer Torrey III, an Episcopal missionary, grandson of R. A. Torrey, founded Jesus Abbey as a missionary community in Korea. It has some links with the Episcopal Church and holds an Evangelical doctrine.

====Methodist Churches====
In February 2001, the United Methodist Church organized the Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery. It is a Methodist-Benedictine residential double monastery in Collegeville, Minnesota. Besides monastic orders, the Order of Saint Luke is a dispersed religious order within Methodism.

====Presbyterian Churches====
The Community of the Sisterhood Emmanuel was founded in 1973 in Makak, Cameroon, in the Centre Province by Mother Marie, one of the first female Pastors of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon. In 1975, she moved the community to Agyati in Bafut. In 2019, the sisters relocated to Foumbot. The Sisters are trained in strong collaboration with the sister Institutes of the Catholic Church.

====Anabaptism====
Anabaptist Christians &quot;retained many elements of the monastic understanding of a &#x27;holy life&#x27; that followed true faith&quot;. The Hutterites and Bruderhof, for example, live in intentional communities with their big houses having &quot;ground floors for common work, meals and worship, the two-storey attics with small rooms, like monastic cells, for married couples&quot;.

====Quakerism and Shakerism====
The Shakers, who are also known as the &quot;Shaking Quakers&quot;, have been characterized as a &quot;Protestant monastic order providing refuge and otherworldly compensation&quot;. They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, pacifism, and their model of equality of the sexes, which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. They are also known for their simple living, architecture, and furniture. Sincere newcomers are invited to become Shakers:

Currently, there are two remaining Shakers, Brother Arnold Hadd and Sister June Carpenter, though they hope that others will join them at the only remaining Shaker community, the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village.

==Ecumenical expressions==
Christian monasticism is experiencing renewal in the form of several new foundations with an &#x27;inter-Christian&#x27; vision for their respective communities.

In 1944 Roger Schütz, a pastor of the Swiss Reformed Church, founded a small religious brotherhood in France which became known as the Taizé Community. Although he was partly inspired by the hope of reviving monasticism in the Protestant tradition, the brotherhood was interdenominational, accepting Roman Catholic brothers, and is thus an ecumenical rather than a specifically Protestant community.

The Order of Ecumenical Franciscans is a religious order of men and women devoted to following the examples of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare of Assisi in their life and understanding of the Christian gospel: sharing a love for creation and those who have been marginalized. It includes members of many different denominations, including Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox, and a range of Protestant traditions. The Order understands its charism to include not only ecumenical efforts and the traditional emphases of the Franciscans in general, but also to help to develop relationships between the various Franciscan orders.

Additional expressions of ecumenical monasticism can be seen in the New Monasticism movement arising from Protestant Evangelicalism. 

==Contributions==

In traditional Catholic societies, monastic communities often took charge of social services such as education and healthcare. 

Max Weber compared the closeted and Puritan societies of the English Dissenters, who sparked much of the Industrial Revolution, to monastic orders. 

Many Utopian thinkers (starting with Thomas More) felt inspired by the common life of monks and sought to apply it to society as a whole (an example is the phalanstère). 

Today, monasticism remains a part of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican faiths.

===Education===
The capitulary of 789 reads: &quot;Let every monastery and every abbey have its school, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic, and grammar.&quot;

In the Middle Ages, monasteries conserved and copied ancient manuscripts in their scriptoria. A prospective monk first learned grammar, logic, and oratory. Later, he would take up mathematics, astronomy, and music. The students would use a stylus on wax. Later, when their handwriting improved, they would be given ink and parchment. Eventually, many of those schools became universities. Monks in scriptoria copied texts of Greece and Rome, as well as religious texts, and kept these manuscripts from being lost during the Middle Ages.

===Medicine===
 Monastic pharmacies stored and studied medicaments. Some of the works that the monks copied were by medical writers, and reading and copying these works helped create a store of medical knowledge. Monasteries had infirmaries to treat the monks, travelers, the poor, old, weak and sick. In 2005, archeologists uncovered waste at Soutra Aisle which helped scientists figure out how people in the Middle Ages treated certain diseases, such as scurvy; because of the vitamin C in watercress, patients would eat it to stop their teeth from falling out. The same archeological group discovered hemlock, a known pain killer, in the drains of the hospital.

Monasteries also aided in the development of agricultural techniques. The requirement of wine for the Mass led to the development of wine culture, as shown in the discovery of the &quot;méthode champenoise&quot; by Dom Perignon. Several liquors like &quot;Bénédictine&quot; and the Trappist beers were also developed in monasteries. Even today many monasteries and convents are locally renowned for their cooking specialties.

The consequence of this centralisation of knowledge was that they initially controlled both public administration and education, where the trivium led through the quadrivium to theology. Christian monks cultivated the arts as a way of praising God. Gregorian chant and miniatures are examples of the practical application of quadrivium subjects.

The status of monks as separate from secular life (at least theoretically), also served a social function. Dethroned Visigothic kings were tonsured and sent to a monastery so that they could not reclaim the crown. Monasteries became a place for second sons to live in celibacy to ensure that a family&#x27;s inheritance went to the first son; and in exchange the families donated to the monasteries. Many cities had a St Giles house for lepers outside the walls, and a Magdalene house for prostitutes and other &quot;fallen women&quot; within the walls.

Monasteries also provided refuge to those like Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor who retired to Yuste in his late years, and his son Philip II of Spain.

<doc id="721875" wikidata="Q887940" url="?curid=721875" title="Rajah Sulayman">
<text>Sulayman, sometimes referred to as Sulayman III (Arabic script: سليمان, Abecedario: &quot;Solimán&quot;) (d. 1590s), was a Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Luzon in the 16th century and was a nephew of Rajah Ache of Luzon. He was the commander of the Tagalog forces in the battle of Manila of 1570 against Spanish forces.

His palace was within the walled and fortified city of Manila. Sulayman – along with his uncle King Ache and Lakandula, who ruled the adjacent &quot;bayan&quot; of Tondo – was one of the three rulers who dealt with the Spanish in the battle of Manila of 1570. The Spanish described him as the most aggressive one due to his youth relative to the other two rulers. Sulayman&#x27;s adoptive son, baptized Agustin de Legaspi upon conversion to Christianity, was proclaimed the sovereign ruler of Tondo upon the death of Lakandula. He along with most of Lakandula&#x27;s sons and most of Sulayman&#x27;s other adoptive sons were executed by the Spanish after being implicated in an assembly to overturn Spanish rule in Manila. This execution helped the Spanish East Indies fortify its rule on parts of Luzon.

== Names ==
Spanish documents note that Sulayman&#x27;s subjects called him &quot;Raja Mura&quot; or &quot;Raja Muda&quot;, &quot;Young Raja&quot;, a reference to the fact that he was Raja Matanda&#x27;s nephew and heir apparent. The Spaniards also called him &quot;Raja Solimano el Mow&quot; so his name is also often spelled as &quot;Solimán&quot; due to Spanish influence.

== Ancestry ==
According to the genealogy proposed by Mariano A. Henson in 1955, and asserted by Majul in 1973, Sulayman was the 14th Raja of Manila since it was founded as a Muslim principality in 1258 by Rajah Ahmad when he defeated the Majapahit suzerain, Raja Avirjirkaya.

==Spanish conquest of Manila (1570–1571)==
Rajah Sulayman was the ruler of Maynila along with Rajah Matanda when the invasion of Legazpi occurred. Manila was already influenced by neighboring Southeast Asian kingdoms. The area was already an entrepot of trade from China, Siam and other places.

The Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi, searching for a suitable place to establish his capital after moving from Cebu to Panay due to Portuguese claim of the archipelago, sent Martín de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo on an expedition northward to Luzon upon hearing of a prosperous kingdom there.

Goiti anchored at Cavite and established his authority by sending a &quot;message of friendship&quot; to the states surrounding the Pasig River. Sulayman, who had been given authority over these settlements by the ageing Rajah Matanda, was willing to accept the &quot;friendship&quot; from the Spaniards. However, he refused to cede his sovereignty, and had no choice but to waged war against the new arrivals&#x27; demands. As a result, Goíti and his army invaded the kingdoms in June 1570, sacking and burning the great city before returning to Panay.

==Tarik Sulayman and the Battle of Bangkusay (1571)==
Some controversy exists about the identity of the leader of the Macabebe people that initiated the Battle of Bangkusay in 1571. That chieftain is referred to by Filipino historians as Tarik Sulayman. In some versions of the Battle of Bangkusay, Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe and Sulayman III of Manila are the same person, while other contend that they are separate individuals.

Spanish documents do not name the leader of the Macabebe Revolt, but record that he died at Bangkusay, resulting in a Macabebe retreat and Spanish victory. Sulayman III, on the other hand, is clearly recorded as participating in the Revolt of 1574, and thus cannot be the unnamed figure who died in 1571 at Bangkusay.

==The &quot;Sulayman Revolt&quot; (1574) ==
When López de Legazpi died in 1572, his successor, Governor-General Guido de Lavezaris, did not honour their agreements with Sulayman and Lakandula. He sequestered the properties of both kings and tolerated Spanish atrocities.

In response, Sulayman and Lakandula led a revolt in the villages of Navotas in 1574, taking advantage of the confusion brought about by the attacks of Chinese pirate Limahong. This is often referred to as the &quot;Manila Revolt of 1574&quot; but is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sulayman Revolt&quot; and the &quot;Lakandula Revolt.&quot; Since it involved naval forces, the Sulayman Revolt is also known as the &quot;First Battle of Manila Bay&quot;.

Friar Gerónimo Marín and Juan de Salcedo were tasked with pursuing conciliatory talks with the kingdoms. Lakandula and Sulayman agreed to Salcedo&#x27;s peace treaty and an alliance was formed between the two groups.

== Life after 1574 ==
Some accounts from the American Occupation claim that Sulayman was killed during the revolt of 1574, but this once again seems to be the result of Sulayman being confused with Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe, who had died in the previous revolt in 1571. A review of genealogical documents in the National Archives notes that Sulayman lived past the 1574 revolt, in which his son, Rahang Bago, was killed, and lived long enough to adopt the children of an unnamed sibling to be his descendants.

Sulayman is no longer mentioned in the accounts of events that took place from 1586 to 1588, which involved many members of his family.

== Descendants ==
According to Luciano P.R. Santiago&#x27;s genealogical research, Sulayman married his cousin, a princess from Borneo, and they had at least two biological children: a son referred to as &quot;Rahang Bago&quot; (&quot;new prince&quot;; written as &quot;Raxa el Vago&quot; in the Spanish texts), and a daughter who would be baptized Doña María Laran. A legend cited by the government of Pasay in the 1950s also says Sulayman had two children: a son named Suwaboy, and a daughter, Dayang-dayang (Princess) Pasay, who would inherit from her father the lands south of Manila now known as Pasay and Parañaque. However, Rahang Bago and his cousin Lumantalan were killed by the Spanish in November 1574, in the confusion that ensued during the attack of the Chinese corsair, Limahong.

According to Santiago&#x27;s research, Doña María Laran had two daughters: Doña Inés Dahitim, the elder, who married Don Miguel Banal of Quiapo; and Doña María Guinyamat, who married a Don Agustín Turingan. Luciano P.R. Santiago theorizes that Don Miguel Banal was the son of the Don Juan Banal implicated in the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587. Santiago furthers that Don Miguel Banal and Doña Inés Dahitim are said to have begotten the second Filipino to join the Augustinian Order, Fray Marcelo Banal de San Agustín.

The oral legend cited by the local government of Pasay says that Dayang-dayang Pasay married a local prince named Maytubig and settled in the place called Balite. The legend says that they had a daughter named Dominga Custodio, who grew up to donate all her lands to the Augustinians just before her death.

Santiago, however, claims that aside from his biological children, Sulayman had descendants by adoption. Santiago&#x27;s genealogical research suggests that Sulayman had at least one male sibling, unnamed in the records, and who had died prior to the death of Rahang Bago in 1574. Sulayman chose to adopt the sons of this sibling, who were identified in records as Agustin de Legaspi, Don Gabriel Taumbasan, and Don Jerónimo Bassi. All three adopted children of Sulayman participated in the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587, and only Taumbasan was not executed, having instead been exiled in Mexico for four years.

==Others==
According to Meranau history, he is part of this list of rulers:
* Rajah Sulayman
* Rajah Indarafatra
* Rajah Umaka&#x27;an

==Legacy==
In Rizal Park in Manila is a statue of Rajah Sulayman as a hero against Spanish invasion. Rajah Soliman Science and Technology High School in Binondo, Manila – one of two science high schools – is named after him.

<text>The Santa Ana Volcano or Ilamatepec () is a large stratovolcano located in the Santa Ana department of El Salvador. At above sea level, it is the highest volcano in the country. It is located immediately west of Coatepeque Caldera.

The volcano was the inspiration for one of the active volcanoes in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s famous French novella (The Little Prince), based on his life with his Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry, who was The Rose in the story.

==Geography==
The summit of Santa Ana features four nested calderas and volcanic craters, with the innermost containing a small crater lake. Collapse of the summit during the late Pleistocene (inferring from underlying soil samples, the upper age limit is no more than 57,000 years ago) produced a massive debris avalanche that reached the Pacific Ocean, forming the Acajutla Peninsula. Subsequent eruptions have largely rebuilt the edifice.

There have been numerous historical eruptions since the 16th century, both at the summit and from cinder cones on the lower flanks, and also the flank vents of San Marcelino located east of Santa Ana. The San Marcelino vents erupted in 1722 and flowed eastwards for 11 km, destroying the village of San Juan Tecpan.

In October, 2005, the volcano erupted, killing at least two people, injuring seven people, forcing many people to flee their villages. The volcano spat rocks for over with rocks the size of cars. The eruption contributed to the damage from Hurricane Stan. The most recent previous eruption had been in 1904.

==Climate==
The climate on the northeast facing slope of the volcano sees substantial rainfall in the summer months. Located at 13.9 N, 89.6 W, altitude : 1770 m, the climate is classified as a subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;).

<text>Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange (; December 18, 1610 in Amiens – October 23, 1688 in Paris, aged 77), also known simply as Charles Dufresne, was a distinguished French philologist and historian of the Middle Ages and Byzantium.

==Life==
Educated by Jesuits, du Cange studied law and practiced for several years before assuming the office of Treasurer of France. Du Cange was a busy, energetic man who pursued historical scholarship alongside his demanding official duties and his role as head of a large family.

Du Cange&#x27;s most important work is his &quot;Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae Latinitatis&quot; (Glossary of writers in medieval and late Latin, Paris, 1678, 3 vol.), revised and expanded under various titles, for example, &quot;Glossarium manuale ad scriptores mediae et infimae Latinitatis&quot; (Halae, 1772–1784) or from 1840 onward, &quot;Glossarium mediae et infimae Latinitatis&quot; (Glossary of medieval and late Latin). This work, together with a glossary of medieval and late Greek that he published ten years later, has gone through numerous editions and revisions and is still consulted frequently by scholars today. Du Cange&#x27;s pioneering work distinguished medieval Latin and Greek from their earlier classical forms, marking the beginning of the study of the historical development of languages.

Du Cange mastered languages in order to pursue his main scholarly interests, medieval and Byzantine history. He corresponded voluminously with his fellow scholars. His great historical and linguistic knowledge was complemented by equally deep learning in archaeology, geography and law. In addition to his glossaries, he produced important new editions of Byzantine historians and a number of other works. His extensive history of Illyria was not published until 1746 by Joseph Keglevich, who partially corrected it.

Du Cange is one of the historians Edward Gibbon cites most frequently in his &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. In one footnote he calls du Cange &quot;our sure and indefatigable guide in the Middle Ages and Byzantine history.&quot;

<doc id="722008" wikidata="Q3048475" url="?curid=722008" title="Martinus Fabri">
<text>Martinus Fabri (died May 1400) was a North Netherlandish composer of the late 14th century.

Fabri was probably either from Flanders or the Netherlands, and lived near the end of the Middle Ages. The surname &quot;Fabri&quot; was probably a Latinization of a name like Smit, Smeets or perhaps Le Fèvre (all meaning &quot;smith&quot;) . Little is known about his life. Apart from an undated mention of his name in the records of the church of St Donatian, Bruges, he is known to have been a singer at the court of Holland at The Hague from 1395 until his death in May 1400 . Of the three singers known to have been at the court in this time period, he was the only one known to have had a university degree . After his demise, several books of polyphonic music were bought from his estate by the Count of Holland for use in his chapel .

Of his compositions, only four complete pieces survive, all ballades. Two of these have French texts (&quot;Or se depart&quot; and &quot;N&#x27;ay je cause d’estre lies et joyeux&quot;) and are in the &quot;ars subtilior&quot; style, highly complex and mannered . Both are three-voice compositions, though there are two (incompatible) alternatives for the third voice in &quot;Or se depart&quot;—a triplum and a contratenor . The other two ballades are in Dutch (&quot;Eer ende lof heb d&#x27;aventuer&quot; and &quot;Een cleyn parabel&quot;), with a simpler syllabic style of setting . The Leiden manuscript in which all of Fabri&#x27;s works are found also contains an incomplete ballade, &quot;Een cleyn parabel&quot;, the text of which describes a dilemma: the poet loves his lady and would like to marry her, but finds it difficult to accept her recently born child. This may be an autobiographical reference: Martinus Fabri had a son baptized in April 1396, and the godmother was Margaret of Cleves, Countess of Holland .

<doc id="722036" wikidata="Q4160199" url="?curid=722036" title="Anri Jergenia">
<text>Anri Mikhail-ipa Jergenia (; 8 August 1942 – 5 January 2020) had been one of the leading politicians of the internationally unrecognised Republic of Abkhazia since it achieved de facto independence from Georgia. From June 2001 to November 2002 he was the republic&#x27;s Prime Minister and for a time Jergenia looked to be the favourite to succeed Abkhazia&#x27;s first president Vladislav Ardzinba.

==Early life and career==

Jergenia was born on 8 August 1942 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Law in 1963. During Soviet times, he held several offices within the administration of the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: investigator at the Interior Ministry, chief investigator of the Prosecutor’s Office of Sukhumi, Public Court Chairman of Sukhumi and member of the Supreme Court of the
Abkhazian ASSR.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union, from 1992 to 2001, Jergenia served as the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Abkhazia, as which, amongst other things, he had to defend Abkhazia&#x27;s treatment of its prisoners of war. On 14 April 1999 Jergenia was re-appointed by the People&#x27;s Assembly to a second term as Prosecutor General only after several rounds of voting.

From 1990 to 2002 Jergenia was the chief negotiator and designated representative at the Georgian-Abkhazian peace conference for President Vladislav Ardzinba. In this capacity, he personally handled most of the negotiations with Russia, Georgia, the United States and the United Nations.

==Prime minister==

Jergenia was appointed to the post of Prime Minister June 7, 2001. Due to President Ardzinba&#x27;s deteriorating health, Jergenia could lead Abkhazia politically, unlike previous Prime Ministers, who had mainly concerned themselves with economic policy. Perhaps even more so than other Abkhazian politicians, he was pro-Russian, and vociferously opposed to reunification with Georgia. Jergenia openly discussed working towards associate membership of Russia and encouraged Abkhazians to take up Russian passports, which a large percentage of the population eventually did. He also pledged a military alliance with Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia to discourage Georgia from attacking either entity.

On 29 November 2002, Jergenia was fired by President Ardzinba, officially due to his failure to ensure fulfillment of budget targets and to prepare adequately for winter. However, for the first nine months of that year budget had been implemented fully and Jergenia&#x27;s dismissal was widely seen as politically motivated. At the moment of his sacking, he had just returned from Moscow where he had signed a contract on supplying electricity to Krasnodar krai from Abkhazia, and he was widely seen at the time as the main candidate for succeeding Ardzinba as president. The President&#x27;s wife, Svetlana Ardzinba, was Jergenia&#x27;s first cousin, and Jergenia was thought to have been building up support in Moscow. Some think that Ardzinba found that Jergenia was too openly ambitious about the presidency, that he put Russian interests above Abkhazian interest, or that he dropped support for Jergenia due to his unpopularity with the Abkhazian population.

Jergenia was replaced by former Prime Minister Gennady Gagulia. This led to a shift in Abkhazian foreign policy, as Jergenia, while still steadfast on the question of independence, was much more open to negotiations than his successor.

Jergenia had been a close friend and collaborator of Ardzinba since the 1970s, but the two fell out when Ardzinba dismissed Jergenia as Prime Minister. They reconciled after Ardzinba retired as President in 2005.

==2004 presidential elections==
Already during the 2002 Parliamentary elections, while still Prime Minister, Jergenia had supported the parliamentary candidates of public movement Amtsakhara. In 2003, he spoke at Amtsakhara&#x27;s congress, where he argued in favour of reducing Presidential powers and moving towards a mixed presidential/parliamentary model of government. Jergenia then became Amtsakhara&#x27;s favoured candidate for the October 2004 presidential elections before it entered into an alliance with United Abkhazia and chose to back Sergei Bagapsh instead. A minority faction of Amtsakhara continued its support for Jergenia, and he did enter into the elections, with Ruslan Kishmaria as his Vice-Presidential candidate, head of the Gali district assembly. The pair came in only fourth place in the first round, receiving 2277 votes, and did not contest the second.

<text>Pools of Darkness is a role-playing video game published by Strategic Simulations in 1991. It is the fourth (and final) entry in the &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; series of Gold Box games, and the story is a continuation of the events of the third game, &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot;. Like the previous games in the series, it is set in the Forgotten Realms, a campaign setting from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Players must stop an invasion from an evil god, eventually traveling to other dimensions to confront his lieutenants.

The cover art and introduction screen shows female drow though it is unclear who in the gameworld they represent. The novel &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot;, loosely based on the game, was released in 1992.

== Story ==
The party starts their adventure in the city of Phlan, charged with the task to safely escort Council Member Sasha on a diplomatic mission. Upon leaving the city, Lord Bane, along with four of his lieutenants, claims the entire land of Faerûn as his own, and magically teleports, destroys, and removes many cities off the face of the land.

The goal of the game is to systematically restore order to the realms by destroying Bane&#x27;s minions one by one, and returning light and order to the land plunged in darkness.

== Gameplay ==
To play &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot;, one simply needs to create characters and form a party. The gameplay basics are identical to all games in the series. The game does come with a pre-designed party, but many players prefer to create their own characters. One can modify the appearance and some colors of the character&#x27;s combat icon and then name the character. A maximum of six characters may be added to the party and it&#x27;s highly recommended to use all six spaces as the game does not give any handicaps for smaller parties. Non-player characters sometimes join the party in the game, making it possible to have more than six characters. Characters can also be transferred from &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot;.

The party&#x27;s objective is to defeat Bane&#x27;s lieutenants Thorne (an ancient red dragon), Kalistes (a Marilith), and Tanetal (a Glabrezu) and acquire the items they possess. The ultimate goal is to reach Bane&#x27;s Land and face off against Bane&#x27;s last and greatest lieutenant, Gothmenes (a Balor). All of the lieutenants are found in other dimensions, which can be reached using portals known as Pools of Darkness.

Traveling through the pools can cause many types of items the characters are holding to be permanently destroyed and lost. The party may opt to leave these items in a vault to save them. Any items from the dimensions will suffer this same fate when traveling back to the realms. Some very powerful magic items and all non-magical items can survive the trip.

There are also many side quests the party can do along the way, which can help the party in gaining experience and items, especially early on. There are many unmarked areas on the overworld the party can enter, which can be found if the player looks around the open fields for any such places. This is true of all the overworlds.

=== Quests ===
The mandatory quests involve:
* Clearing the Steading near Dragonhorn&#x27;s Gap, which opens the way to the Dragon&#x27;s Aerie.
* Clearing the Dragon&#x27;s Aerie, which opens the way to Thorne&#x27;s Cave via a Pool of Darkness.
* Clearing Thorne&#x27;s Cave, which will give the party the Horn of Doom.
* Clearing the drow caves and Kalistes&#x27; Temple under Zhentil Keep, which opens the way to Kalistes&#x27; Land via a Pool of Darkness.
* Clearing Kalistes&#x27; Parlor, which will give the party the Crystal Ring.
* Clearing the red tower of Marcus, which opens the way to Moander&#x27;s body via a Pool of Darkness.
* Clearing the heart of Moander where Tanetal resides, which will give the party the Talisman of Bane.
* Clearing Arcam&#x27;s Cave under Mulmaster, which opens the way to Bane&#x27;s Land via a Pool of Darkness.
* Finally, clearing Bane&#x27;s Land and defeating Gothmenes, who then battles Elminster.

There are also side quests in several places, and famous people in the realm too. For example, Elminster was always there to maintain the dimensional portal for the party should they arrive at any Pool of Darkness. The lost princess &quot;Alusair Nacacia&quot; will ask the party to help her to fight Rakshasas in Myth Drannor. Lastly, after finishing the final quest, the party had the option to either end their journey or go through one more dungeon of enemies and traps, known as &quot;Dave&#x27;s Challenge&quot;.

==Features==
&quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; differed from its predecessors in a number of ways. Unlike other Forgotten Realms Gold Box games where the party always stayed in Faerûn, the quests that the party have to endure traversed many dimensions to do battle with Bane&#x27;s lieutenants. These include Thorne&#x27;s Cave, Kalistes&#x27; Land, a visit to then sleeping Moander&#x27;s colossus body in Astral Plane, and finally Bane&#x27;s Land itself in Acheron.

Mages have the ability to get up to level 9 spells (the maximum). A popular spell available in this game is the Delayed Blast Fireball, which can cause damage to many targets at once. Unlike &quot;Secret of the Silver Blades&quot;, the fireball cannot be delayed and is cast immediately.

&quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; followed its predecessors closely in terms of structure. The party could have a maximum of six adventurers (with two extra slots for NPCs). Characters had the ability to advance to level 40.

Combat in &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot;, especially late in the story, differed greatly from the encounters of the previous games. The player&#x27;s characters faced some of the toughest creatures in the AD&amp;D universe, in addition to a number of new and formidable critters created specifically for the game, such as the Pets of Kalistes (intelligent magic spiders that can see invisible enemies and whose venomous bite had a -2 save) and the Minions of Bane (which have the magic resistances of demons and the breath weapons of dragons).

The game was by far the most extensive of any of the series, in storyline depth and possibilities of advancement and equipment. The game also featured better graphics at the time as it supported VGA 256 colors instead of 16. Another minor difference is the font used in the game is less stylish, but easier to read.

==Differences between versions==
In the Amiga version, scrolls could be joined into bundles, while the MS-DOS version didn&#x27;t feature this option. Also games could be loaded in the camp menu of the Amiga version. MS-DOS users had to restart or enter a training hall and remove all their characters from the party to load a game.

==Reception==
&quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; was much less successful than the first Gold Box games, with SSI selling 52,793 copies. &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; was reviewed in 1992 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #178 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. In &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Scorpia found the game enjoyable, with better graphics than in the prior Gold Box games. She criticized the &quot;lame ending&quot;, annoying sounds, and having to abandon weapons when visiting another dimension, but called &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; &quot;the best of the lot&quot; and &quot;the ultimate challenge for the experienced Gold Box gamer&quot;.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Pools of Darkness&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #31 (May/June, 1992) and stated that &quot;The system is cleaner, quicker, easier to understand and better to look at and listen to. The adventure&#x27;s plot is deep and believable, its scope is large and varied, and its monsters numerous and deadly. What more can a guy (or girl) ask for?&quot;

According to GameSpy, while &quot;not remembered as the most memorable of the Forgotten Realms Gold Box games, but it was definitely worth playing back then, if you braved the previous three installments&quot;.

<doc id="722047" wikidata="Q2301737" url="?curid=722047" title="New Norcia, Western Australia">
<text>New Norcia () is a town in Western Australia, north of Perth, near the Great Northern Highway. It is situated next to the banks of the Moore River, in the Shire of Victoria Plains. New Norcia is the only monastic town in Australia, with its Benedictine abbey founded in 1848. The monks later founded a mission and schools for Aboriginal children. A series of Catholic colleges were created, with the school that became St Benedict&#x27;s College in 1965 later gaining notoriety for being the site of sexual abuse that took place in the late 1960s and 1970s.

The town has many heritage sites and places of interest. New Norcia Station, a ground station for the European Space Agency is located south of the town. Since a road bypass was complete in 2017, heavy traffic bypasses the town.

== History ==
On 1 March 1846, a Benedictine mission to the local Yued Aboriginal people was started about to the north, led by the Spanish Benedictine monks Giuseppe Serra and Rosendo Salvado. Within a year the mission was moved to where the town is today and on 1 March 1847 the foundation stone of the monastery was laid.

The place was named New Norcia after Norcia in Italy, the birthplace of St Benedict, home to the Monastery of Saint Benedict. Unlike the Italian town, which is pronounced , , New Norcia is pronounced .

A significant diversion of the Great Northern Highway completed in 2017, known as the New Norcia Bypass, diverted heavy traffic away from the buildings and town.

=== Abbey history===
The abbey was founded by two Spanish Benedictine monks, Giuseppe Serra and Rosendo Salvado on 1 March 1847. After two years spent among the local Aboriginal people, Serra and Salvado came to the conclusion that they could be more easily converted by establishing a mission rather than following them on their journeys. Salvado was appointed the first abbot of New Norcia on 12 March 1867.

In 1886, of land was leased to Salvado, in order to fulfil his aim of encouraging local Aboriginal people to settle there, become farmers, and eventually own the land. However, after Salvado&#x27;s death, the new abbot, Fulgentius Torres, turned the focus of the mission away from Aboriginal children, and was more concerned with the education of children of Catholic settlers. In 1949, the Benedictines applied to the government to purchase the land, which the government eventually permitted, despite other competing interests, in order to honour the 1886 agreement with the monks. However, the agreement did not include any ongoing obligation on the part of the Benedictines to ensure that Aboriginal people could use and benefit from the land.

Abbots at the monastery include:
* Rosendo Salvado, 12 March 1867 – 29 December 1900, died as abbot, aged 86 years
* Fulgentius Torres, 1902 – 6 October 1914, died as abbot, aged 53 years
* Anselm Catalan, 1915–1951 (resigned), died 29 July 1959, aged 80 years
* Gregory Gomez, 1951–1971 (resigned), died 31 May 1995, aged 91 years
* Bernard Rooney, 31 March 1974 – 15 June 1980 (resigned)
*[Placid Spearritt, appointed apostolic administrator of the community 1983–1997]
* Placid Spearritt, 29 January 1997 – 4 October 2008, died as abbot, aged 75 years
* John Herbert, 23 January 2009 to present

===New Norcia Mission===
There were also two institutions for Aboriginal children: St Mary&#x27;s (for boys) and St Joseph&#x27;s (for girls), collectively known as New Norcia Mission. The children were taught mainly practical skills, and after leaving school they often worked at the Mission. The New Norcia Mission was scheduled under the &quot;Industrial Schools Act 1874&quot;, meaning that the abbot had &quot;complete control&quot; over the children living there. Both schools closed in 1974.

St Mary&#x27;s Mission, also known as St Mary&#x27;s College, was founded in 1848 as a boarding school for Aboriginal boys. Some boys, including wards of state in the 1960s, were place there by the state government. In his 2021 autobiographical book &quot;God, the Devil and Me&quot;, Alf Taylor (1945–2023) recounts the horrific verbal and physical abuse meted out to Aboriginal boys living in the mission by the brothers and nuns during the 1950s and 1960s. The book was short-listed for the 2022 New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards, Indigenous Writers&#x27; Prize.

St Joseph&#x27;s Native School and Orphanage was founded in 1861 by the monks. Benedictine Missionary Sisters sent from Spain took over in 1904 and ran it until its closure in 1974. Aboriginal girls and young women lived and attended school there, sometimes sent by their families, and sometimes placed there as government policy if they were children of single mothers. The school and orphanage were rebuilt in 1909. There were stories of physical and emotional abuse of the girls at St Joseph&#x27;s.

The monks Latinised the children&#x27;s Aboriginal names, making it hard to trace who they were later. From the time of Abbot Fulgentius Torres onwards, the focus changed and tensions arose in how the &quot;orphanages&quot; were being run. Adults were prevented from visiting their children, and in 1907 an incident occurred in which 32 Aboriginal fathers were arrested by police when they tried to storm the mission to see their children.

In 2001 there was a reunion of former residents of New Norcia Mission.

===Post and Telegraph Office===
A post office was opened as Victoria Plains in April 1857. A telegraph line was erected through to Victoria Plains in 1873 and the position of postmistress was created. Mary Ellen Cuper was appointed to that position in January 1874. The post and telegraph offices were combined on 4 March 1874, on the same day that the name of the offices was changed to New Norcia. Cuper was appointed as the first post and telegraph mistress of New Norcia – thus becoming the first Aboriginal person to be appointed to such a position in any of the Australian colonies. Her health started to deteriorate in the last part of 1875 due to tuberculosis so she trained Sarah Ninak – another Aboriginal woman - in all of the required skills. Ninak took increasing responsibility for the duties, and by 1876 was acting in charge of the office. Cuper died in January 1877.
===New Norcia Hotel===
Originally known as the New Norcia Hostel, showcasing neo-classical architecture, the multifaceted New Norcia Hotel was opened in 1927 and was used for the parents of boarders at the town&#x27;s colleges. It later opened to the public, and by the late 20th century, the New Norcia Hotel functioned as a pub. It closed in January 2020.

===Land sale===
In early 2021, Andrew Forrest&#x27;s company, Tattarang, via its subsidiary Harvest Road, acquired the land that the government had sold to the monks in 1949, with over changing hands for it this time. The new owners said that they were planning to meet with the traditional owners of the land, the Yued people, and discuss opportunities for training and employment.

==Colleges==
There has been a number of colleges situated in the town associated with the monastery, situated on the west side of the current main road alignment which passes through the town.

St Gertrude&#x27;s College was completed in 1908.

St Ildephonsus&#x27; College was opened in 1913. It operated until 1964 as St Ildephonsus&#x27; under the Marist Brothers order. From 1965 onwards, it was run by the Benedictines as St Benedict&#x27;s College.

In 1972, St Benedict&#x27;s and St Gertrude&#x27;s become co-educational, with student from both colleges sharing classes, and in 1974 the two became known jointly as Salvado College. Each building was still referred to individually as St Benedict&#x27;s and St Gertrude&#x27;s. In 1986 Salvado College became New Norcia Catholic College, which closed at the end of 1991.

The colleges were among those investigated by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse for historical accusations. The colleges were among the worst for historical accusations of child sexual abuse of any Catholic institution in Australia. Of the 53 priests who were at New Norcia between 1950 and 2010, the proportion accused of sexually abusing children was 21.5 per cent. That compares with 7 per cent nationally. The figures were contained in a report released by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in February 2017. During the 1960s, 29 per cent of the clergy at New Norcia had allegedly molested or abused children at some point during their career. There were 65 claims of abuse made about New Norcia, of which 26 were about a single perpetrator. The Catholic Church paid victims $869,000 in compensation.

In 2016, a trial in the District Court of Western Australia was told about perverted behaviour by monks at St Benedict&#x27;s College during the 1960s and 1970s. Brother Dominic &quot;Goofy&quot; Benedict allegedly took indecent photographs of boys and measured one student&#x27;s penis with a tape measure. Bishop Max Davis, who was acquitted by a jury, said Brother Dom would hit boys or push them up against brick walls.

== The town today ==

The town of New Norcia has buildings in a Spanish style of architecture, along with some other historical sites. Among these are the two old boarding schools, St Ildephonsus&#x27; and St Gertrude&#x27;s (both now used for accommodation and various social functions), the abbey church (containing the tomb of Rosendo Salvado), an old mill, a wine press, and the monastery itself.

The town has attracted interest and tourist visits for most of its existence and as a consequence a number of guide books and histories have been produced. The visitor and information centre is in the Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

The Benedictine monks continue to occupy the monastery and are involved with most of the enterprises in the town. The last Spanish monk of New Norcia, Dom Paulino, died on 18 January 2010, aged 99. He had worked in the monastery bakery, as a shoemaker, and &quot;in retirement&quot; in reviving the production of olive oil..

New Norcia is respected in Australian culinary circles for its quality bakery (built in 1886) offering bread, nutcake and biscotti. Also maintaining olive oil production and locally made wines, port and ale can be purchased at the community or from special outlets.

Much of the New Norcia farm has been sold off to pay the costs of damages resulting from the sexual abuse of children who were residents in the boarding colleges by the Benedictine monks.

===New Norcia Museum and Art Gallery===
The New Norcia Museum and Art Gallery is located in the converted buildings of St Joseph&#x27;s Native School. Beside displaying many Christian relics and historical paintings, the gallery hosts an exhibition of finalists for the Mandorla Art Award, the only Australian award solely for Christian religious artworks based on Bible scripture themes. In 1985 the first winner of the prize was Theo Koning with based on the theme Creation from the Book of Revelation 15:3.

In 1986, 26 paintings were stolen. Several weeks later, all but one of the stolen paintings were returned. They were badly damaged, but were eventually repaired. Marc Fennell&#x27;s 2023 three-part documentary &quot;The Mission&quot; for SBS Television revisited the investigation into the theft, and spoke to former students at the schools.

==Heritage sites==
With decreasing numbers of active colleges, and changes in the organisation of the town, some buildings and sites have been restored and incorporated into a heritage trail within the town. The following buildings are among the heritage buildings situated on the site of the monastery, which is registered on the Register of the National Estate and classified by the National Trust of Australia WA:

===Pipe organs===
There are two pipe organs located within the abbey buildings. In the Abbey Church of the Holy Trinity is a large German organ, built in 1922 by Albert Möser of Munich, with 34 speaking stops. The organ was designed in consultation with the abbey organist, Dom Stephen Moreno.

The second pipe organ, of 11 speaking stops and much more modern in style, is located in the oratory chapel. This organ was built in 1983 by Bellsham Pipe Organs.

==Space station==

The New Norcia Station, a ground station for the European Space Agency, is located south of the town.

==Notable people==
Notable people associated with the town include filmmaker Warwick Thornton, who attended Salvado College.

<text>Crossplay (the term is a portmanteau of &quot;crossdressing&quot; and &quot;cosplay&quot;) is a type of cosplay in which the person dresses up as a character of a different gender. Crossplay&#x27;s origins lie in the anime convention circuit, though, like cosplay, it has not remained exclusive to the genre. While it is similar to Rule 63 (gender-bending) cosplay, it can be differentiated by the performer becoming completely immersed in the codes of another gender, rather than picking and choosing what behavior enhances the performance.

==Female-to-male crossplay==

In most countries that play host to hobbyists who would call themselves cosplayers, female-to-male crossplayers (females costumed as male characters, sometimes abbreviated &quot;FtM&quot;) are far more common, due to a variety of social and cultural factors.

Many (or even most) females will crossplay for the same reasons that they would cosplay – because they like the character and/or the costume, and wish to represent that. In Japan, female costumers tend to dominate (in numbers) the field of cosplay in general, often portraying a huge assortment of colorful characters regardless of gender.

As are portrayed in manga and anime as liminal beings, it is considered &quot;easier&quot; for a female to cross-play as a bishōnen than it would be for her to crossplay as a male character from a Western series.

==Male-to-female crossplay==

Male-to-female crossplayers (males costumed as female characters, sometimes abbreviated &quot;MtF&quot;) are somewhat more common outside Japan.
Originally, in America, a popular anime series for MtF crossplayers was &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, creating &quot;humorous effect and social levity&quot;.

<text>Toonerville Folks ( The Toonerville Trolley That Meets All the Trains) was a popular newspaper comic strip feature by Fontaine Fox, which ran from 1908 to 1955. It began in 1908 in the &quot;Chicago Post&quot;, and by 1913, it was syndicated nationally by the Wheeler Syndicate. From the 1930s on, it was distributed by the McNaught Syndicate.

==Characters and story==
The single-panel gag cartoon (with longer-form comics on Sunday) was a daily look at Toonerville, situated in what are now called the suburbs. Central to the strip was the rickety little trolley called the &quot;Toonerville Trolley that met all the trains&quot;, driven in a frenzy by the grizzly old Skipper to meet each commuter train as it arrived in town. A few of the many richly formed characters included Suitcase Simpson, Mickey McGuire, the Powerful Katrinka, the Terrible Tempered Mr. Bang, Aunt Eppie Hogg, Little Woo-Woo Wortle, The Little Scorpions, and &quot;Stinky&quot; Davis.

==Origin==
Fox described the inspiration for the cartoon series in an article he wrote for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; titled &quot;A Queer Way to Make a Living&quot; (February 11, 1928, page six):
After years of gestation, the idea for the &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot; was born one day up in Westchester County when my wife and I had left New York City to visit Charlie Voight, the cartoonist, in the Pelhams. At the station, we saw a rattletrap of a streetcar, which had as its crew and skipper a wistful old codger with an Airedale beard. He showed as much concern in the performance of his job as you might expect from Captain Hartley when docking the Leviathan.

==Films==
Between 1920 and 1922, 17 &quot;Toonerville&quot; silent film comedy adaptations were scripted by Fox for Philadelphia&#x27;s Betzwood Film Company. These starred Dan Mason as the Skipper with Wilna Hervey as Katrinka. Only seven of those 17 shorts survive today. Four are preserved in the Betzwood Film Archive at Montgomery County Community College, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania.

Mickey Rooney starred as Mickey McGuire in more than 55 comedy shorts filmed between 1927 and 1936. Rooney (né Joe Yule, Jr.) adopted the professional name Mickey McGuire for a time before finally settling on the last name Rooney.

Three &quot;Toonerville&quot; cartoons were produced by Van Beuren Studios in 1936 as part of the &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot; series. Distributed by RKO Radio Pictures Katrinka was animated by Joseph Barbera.
A &quot;Toonerville Trolley&quot; cartoon, &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, was included in &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, a Christmas collection of six animated shorts shown on PBS TV in 1977.

Over the years, various &quot;Toonerville&quot; characters acted as spokesmen for popular products of the day. Skipper, Flem Proddy and Katrinka appeared throughout the decades in advertisements for Drano, Kellogg&#x27;s cereals and Chef Boyardee foods.

==Reprints==

Between 1934 and 1940, comic book reprints of the panel appeared in many issues of &quot;All-American Comics&quot;, &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;, and &quot;Popular Comics&quot;. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative United States postage stamps.

In 1972, Herb Galewitz and Don Winslow compiled &quot;Fontaine Fox&#x27;s Toonerville Trolley&quot;, a 184-page book of daily panels, for Weathervane Books, an imprint of Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons.

<text>The Congress of the Republic () is the unicameral legislature of the Republic of Guatemala. The Guatemalan Congress is made up of 160 deputies who are elected by direct universal suffrage to serve four-year terms. The electoral system is closed party list proportional representation. 31 of the deputies are elected on a nationwide list, whilst the remaining 127 deputies are elected in 22 multi-member constituencies. Each of Guatemala&#x27;s 22 departments serves as a district, with the exception of the department of Guatemala containing the capital, which on account of its size is divided into two &quot;(distrito central&quot; and &quot;distrito Guatemala)&quot;. Departments are allocated seats based on their population size and they are shown in the table below.

== Deputies by Department==

== History == 
Guatemala had a bicameral legislature in the 1845 constitution. It was replaced with the unicameral Chamber of Representatives (), which was in turn reformulated as the National Assembly () in 1879, then the Congress of the Republic in 1945.

== Political culture ==
It is not uncommon for deputies to change parties during the legislature&#x27;s term or to secede from a party and create a new party or congressional block.

== Building ==
The Congress of the Republic Guatemala is located in the Legislative Palace in Guatemala city.

During the protests against the budget for 2021 on 21 November 2020, protestors entered the building and set parts of it on fire.

<doc id="722119" wikidata="Q620834" url="?curid=722119" title="Apatheism">
<text>Apatheism (; a portmanteau of &quot;apathy&quot; and &quot;theism&quot;) is the attitude of apathy toward the existence or non-existence of God(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system. The term was coined by Canadian sociologist Stuart Johnson. 

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods do exist or do not exist. The existence of a god or gods is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant. One of the first recorded apatheists was arguably Denis Diderot (1713–1784), who wrote: &quot;It is very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley; but not at all so to believe or not in God.&quot;

Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism &quot;uncharted territory in the philosophy of religion&quot;. Political theorist and constitutional law scholar Adam Scott Kunz has further defined apatheism as &quot;the philosophical attitude of indifference, both public and private, to (1) the question of the existence of a deity, (2) the metaphysical and practical value of loyalty to that deity, and/or (3) the interaction of that deity with the natural world&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Apatheism&quot; was first coined by Canadian sociologist Stuart Johnson in his study of indifference to religion amid secularization published in 1972.

==Mindset==
Apatheism considers the question of the existence or nonexistence of deities to be fundamentally irrelevant in every way that matters. This position should not be understood as a skeptical position in a manner similar to that of, for example, atheists or agnostics who question the existence of deities or whether we can know anything about them.

Adam Scott Kunz has argued that apatheism&#x27;s opposite is zeal, just as atheism&#x27;s opposite is theism. Instead of viewing apatheism as a different form of belief, Kunz argues that apatheism and zeal can interact with atheism and theism on a two-dimensional spectrum similar to a political spectrum. A person can be a theist, while at the same time have an attitude of apatheism (such beliefs are common in deism) or zeal toward questions of existence, loyalty, or involvement of deity. Likewise, an atheist can be either apatheistic or zealous.

==Reasoning==

===Irrelevance===
Apatheists may feel that even if there are gods/deities and the existence and legitimacy of them were proven, it would not make a difference to them for one reason or another; therefore, which one(s), if any, are real does not matter and any discussion about it is meaningless. This approach is similar to that of practical atheism.

===Lack of interest===
An apatheist may not have any interest in the god debate simply for lack of interest in the topic.

===Morality===
This apatheistic argument states that morals do not come from god and that if a god exists, there would be no changes with regards to morality; therefore, a god&#x27;s existence or non-existence is irrelevant.

==Related views==
===Apathetic agnosticism===
A view related to apatheism, apathetic agnosticism claims that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans; therefore, their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs. This view has also been called &quot;Pragmatic Agnosticism.&quot;

===Practical atheism===

The view that one should live their life with disregard towards a god or gods. Practical atheism does not see the god questions as irrelevant, in contrast to apatheism. Thus, &quot;practical atheism is disregard for the answers to [God questions], not a disregard for [God questions] &quot;per se&quot;. Unlike atheism proper, the practical atheist acts as if God does not exist and has no authority over his life despite his belief in God. Hence, &quot;practical&quot; atheism is not &quot;actual&quot; atheism.&quot;

<text>Tape v. Hurley, 66 Cal. 473, (1885) was a landmark court case in the California Supreme Court in which the Court found the exclusion of a Chinese American student from public school based on her ancestry unlawful. The case effectively ruled that minority children were entitled to attend public school in California. After the Court&#x27;s decision, San Francisco Superintendent of Schools, Andrew J. Moulder, urged the California state assembly to pass new state legislation which enabled the establishment of segregated schools under the separate but equal doctrine, like the later Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). The establishment of the new school marked the continued segregation in the education system in California.

Tape v. Hurley case was brought by the Tape family, who are Chinese immigrants with an American-born child, in the wake of increasing anti-Chinese sentiments in California after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. Joseph Tape and Mary Tape were informed that their daughter, Mamie Tape, was denied admission to Spring Valley School due to her ancestry. In 1885, Joseph Tape filed a lawsuit on behalf of his daughter in local Court to force the San Francisco Board of Education to allow his daughter to attend the public school near home.

Tape v. Hurley is widely regarded as the starting point when Asian Americans began challenging school segregation and educational inequality. The result of the case gave greater legal foundations for eliminating segregation in the school system later on. Still, it was not until the mid-twenty century when minorities in California won the victory on the path of fighting for school desegregation.

==History==
In September 1859, The Chinese School was opened as a public school for Chinese students in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. Chinese students were legally barred from attending other public schools in San Francisco.

San Francisco established and operated segregated Chinese School from 1859 until 1870, when the law was amended to drop the requirement to educate Chinese children entirely. In 1871, San Francisco quietly cut funding for the Chinese School, and the school subsequently closed. As a result, Chinese parents often sent their children to church schools or hired private teachers.

In 1884, Joseph and Mary Tape challenged San Francisco&#x27;s practice by enrolling their daughter, Mamie, in the all-white Spring Valley School at 1451 Jackson Street. After the school refused to admit Mamie, the Tapes sued the school district in &quot;Tape v. Hurley&quot; and won. San Francisco School District appealed the lower court&#x27;s decision to the California Supreme Court, where the justices sustained the lower court&#x27;s verdict. The case guaranteed the right of children born to Chinese parents to public education. In 1885, the San Francisco School District set up a separate Chinese Primary School; the &quot;Chinese School&quot; was later renamed the &quot;Oriental School,&quot; so that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese students could be assigned to the school. In response to the establishment of the new segregated Chinese School, Mary Tape wrote a letter and argued her daughter&#x27;s right to be educated in the public school near home.

==Background==

=== Discrimination against Chinese immigrants ===

Chinese immigration started from the California Gold Rush in the 1840s when many Chinese immigrants hailed from South China to California to try their luck. Most Chinese immigrants were young males with poor financial backgrounds working on mining and railroad constructions. Chinese immigrants were seen as a threat to the white-dominated labor market due to their strong motivations to work. Protest, violence, and harassment toward Chinese immigrants intensified in 1850, and Chinese workers were subsequently excluded from white-dominated unions. The conflicts between Chinese and white were at their peak in the 1870s, when Chinese workers were seen as the primary reasons behind massive layoffs and poor economic conditions in California. Hundreds of Anti-Chinese riots and protests broke out in the 1870s, and such sentiments of hatred led to legal discrimination against Chinese immigrants extending throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century. Despite anti-Chinese feelings in the United States, the population of Chinese immigrants grew steadily from 1850 to 1880. Until 1880, there were about 105,000 Chinese immigrants in America.

Starting from 1870, state and local law placed a myriad of social and economic restrictions on Chinese immigrants. The Page Act of 1875 was the first restrictive federal immigration law that effectively prohibited Chinese women from entering the United States. In May 1882, the United States Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, banning all immigration from China and barring all Chinese immigrants from naturalization. In 1891, California explicitly enacted the state law: &quot;The coming of Chinese person into the States, whether subjects of the Chinese Empire or otherwise, is prohibited.&quot; During the progressive era, the politicians of both Democratic and Republican parties supported the Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1943, Congress repealed the exclusion laws and permitted 105 Chinese to enter each year. It was not until 1965 when all restrictions of entry were lifted.

===State legislation===
The legislation in the State of California had tremendous changes in the education policies toward minority students from 1850 to 1880.

==== Prior to 1855 ====
The earliest law establishing public education (&quot;Common Schools&quot;) in California was passed in 1851 and divided state funding &quot;by the whole number of children in the State, between the ages of five and eighteen years&quot; without specifying race (Article II, §1). It was repealed and replaced by an 1852 law which also lacked racial restrictions.

==== From 1855 to 1866 ====

Growing anti-Chinese sentiments accelerates the changes of racial restrictions in law. The superseding 1855 Act to establish Common Schools counted only &quot;the number of white children in each county between the ages of four and eighteen years&quot; (§3, 12, 18) and allowed the establishment of a school upon &quot;the petition of fifty heads of white families&quot; (§22). In 1860, California amended the 1855 law to bar &quot;Negroes, Mongolians, and Indians&quot; from public schools, and granted the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, then Andrew J. Moulder, the authority to withhold state funds from districts violating the amended code. The legislation allowed the establishment of segregated schools (§8). The establishment of segregated schools was reiterated in the 1863 law (§68), when the term &quot;Common Schools&quot; was replaced by &quot;Public Schools&quot; and reinforced in 1864, when a requirement was added that a petition by the guardians of &quot;ten or more colored children&quot; was needed to establish a segregated school (§13).

==== From 1866 to 1880 ====
In 1866, the law was rewritten specifically to restrict enrollment in public schools to &quot;all white children, between five and twenty-one years of age&quot; (§53), and required that &quot;children of African or Mongolian descent, and Indian children not living under the care of white persons&quot; be educated in segregated schools (§57), with an exception made for the enrollment of &quot;half-breed Indian children, and Indian children who live in white families or under guardianship of white persons&quot; into public schools upon a majority vote of the local school board (§56). As a last resort, the education of &quot;children, other than white children&quot; was permitted in public schools &quot;&quot;provided&quot;, that a majority of the parents of the children attending such school make no objection, in writing&quot; if there was no other means of educating them (§58). The law now required separate but equal schools (§59). When the law was rewritten in 1870, the restriction of students to white children was retained (§53), and segregated schools were only provided for &quot;children of African descent, and Indian children&quot; (§56), dropping the requirement to educate Chinese children entirely. The potential exceptions for the enrollment of Indian children living with white families or with the written consent of a majority of other parents also disappeared. The separate but equal clause survived (§57).

In 1880, the Political Code was modified to lift the restriction of enrollment to white students (§1662) and the sections requiring separate but equal (§1671) segregated schools (§1669) were repealed.

=== Chinese school ===
Targeted by the restrictive education law, Chinese immigrants found private schools to educate their children. Some Chinese immigrants started Chinese Language School, which enabled immigrants to teach Chinese to the next generation. Other children of immigrants were educated in religious schools and, as a result, were Christianized. Many parents wrote a letter to the education board, expressing the need to establish a Chinese School for all Chinese immigrants in San Francisco. The opening of the new Chinese school was not until September 1859, as the education board of San Francisco attributed the delay to lack of funding. The Chinese school operates as a day school for only nine months due to the low attendance rate. One reason for the low attendance rate is the Chinese&#x27;s lost control over the school administration. However, Superintendent James Denman blamed the Chinese for the school&#x27;s failure, expressing that Chinese immigrants had no interest in learning American ways, and it is not the school system&#x27;s fault. Though Chinese school stopped its day school operation in June 1860, it continued as a night school for another eight months before closing. Later, the school was reopened and renamed Chinese Primary School in 1885, the Oriental School in 1906, and continuously operated as Gordon J. Lau School today.

==Incident==

=== Tape family ===
Mamie Tape was a Chinese American born in San Francisco. Her parents, Joseph C.Tape (趙洽) (1852–1935), and Mary McGladery Tape (1857–1934), were both immigrants from China arriving in California in 1864 and 1868, respectively. Joseph Tape was born in Guangdong province in China and arrived in the United States at the age of twelve. Mary Tape was an orphan who grew up in Shanghai and moved to California at eleven. Mary Tape lived in the Ladies&#x27; Protection and Relief Society, in her early life, where she learned English and American culture. Joseph and Mary Tape met at Mary&#x27;s home Ladies&#x27; Protection and Relief Society and married in 1875. They had four children: Mamie, Frank, Emily, and Gertrude. Joseph Tape was a businessman and an interpreter for the Chinese consulate, while Mary Tape was an amateur photographer and artist. They lived as a prosperous middle-class family and settled in the Cow Hollow neighborhood of San Francisco, a predominantly white community.

=== Before the court ===
In 1880, the California state legislature passed the Political Code, which prevented school districts from refusing admission of non-white students. Despite the existence of the state law, many Chinese children were denied entry to public school. In 1884, Mamie, then eight years old, was denied admission to the Spring Valley School because of her Chinese ancestry. Her father, Joseph Tape, immediately contacted the Chinese consulate for help. Together with the Chinese vice-consul, Frederick Bee, Joseph Tape wrote a letter to Superintendent Andrew Moulder, expressing that the denying of admission violates the constitution of the United States, given that Mamie Tape is a native-born citizen of the United States. However, the San Francisco Board of Education and Superintendent Andrew Moulder insisted that they conformed with relevant laws. Superintendent Andrew Moulder further gained support from State superintendent William Welcher. In response, the Tape family provided medical documents proving that Mamie Tape had a clean bill of health, but the school board did not alter their argument.

Joseph Tape and Mary Tape then sued the San Francisco Board of Education for refusing to allow their American-born children to enter the public school in a white neighborhood. They argued that the school board&#x27;s decision was a violation of the California Political Code, which stated:

Every school, unless otherwise provided by law, must be open for the admission of all children between six and twenty-one years of age residing in the district; and the board of trustees, or city board of education, have power to admit adults and children not residing in the district, whenever good reasons exist therefor. Trustees shall have the power to exclude children of filthy or vicious habits, or children suffering from contagious or infectious diseases.The defendant in the lawsuit was school principal Miss Jennie M.A. Hurley. The San Francisco Board of Education supported Miss Hurley as they believed that she fulfilled her school principal duties.

=== Opinion of the court ===
On January 9, 1885, Superior Court Justice McGuire handed down the decision in favor of the Tapes. On appeal, the California Supreme Court upheld the decision in March 1885 since California law only excluded Indian and African American students from public school. On the court, Tape&#x27;s attorney, W.F. Gibson, argued that the Tapes family was not a typical Chinese family who did not want to assimilate into American society. Instead, the Tapes family was westernized in customs, beliefs, and language. California Supreme Court justice John Sharpstein then claimedRespondent here has the same right to enter a public school that any other child has.

To deny a child, born of Chinese parents in this state, entrance to the public schools would be a violation of the law of the state and the Constitution of the United States.In response to the ruling, Mary Tape sent an incensed letter to the San Francisco school board expressing her outrage:

May you Mr. Moulder, never be persecuted like the way you have persecuted little Mamie Tape. is it a disgrace to be Born a Chinese? Didn&#x27;t God make us all!!! What right! Have you to bar my children out of the school because she is a chinese Descend. Mamie Tape will never attend any of the Chinese schools of your making! Never!!! I will let the world see sir What justice there is When it is govern by the Race prejudice men!!!

== Aftermath ==

After the decision, Andrew Moulder, the Superintendent of Public Schools in San Francisco, sent a telegram to Representative W.B. May of the California State Assembly on March 4, 1885, urging passage of pending bills to reestablish a separate school system for Chinese and other &quot;Mongolian&quot; children. &quot;Without such action I have every reason to believe that some of our classes will be inundated by Mongolians. Trouble will follow.&quot; May responded by championing Assembly Bill 268 through to passage the next day. AB 268 allowed the establishment of &quot;separate schools for children of Mongolian or Chinese descent. When such separate schools are established, Chinese or Mongolian children must not be admitted into any other schools.&quot; This gave the San Francisco school board the authority to establish the Chinese Primary School in San Francisco. With the law rewritten, Mamie Tape could no longer enroll in the white-dominated public school near her home. In Mary Tape&#x27;s letter to Board of Education, she expressed her outrage toward the new Chinese Primary School:Mamie Tape will never attend any of the Chinese schools of your making! Never!!!Despite Mary Tape&#x27;s statement in the letter, she enrolled Mamie Tape in the Chinese School. Tape v. Hurley has a mixed result. On the one hand, it permitted the enrollment of Chinese children into public schools. On the other hand, the court gave the education board the right to establish a segregated school in San Francisco. &quot;Tape v. Hurley&quot; is both temporally and substantively similar to the landmark case &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which in 1896 justified the legality of segregated schools on the premise of &quot;separate but equal.&quot; However, the cases differ in the fact that African-American children were regarded as citizens and Chinese-American children as foreigners or outsiders.

<doc id="722152" wikidata="Q3893330" url="?curid=722152" title="Alphabet of human thought">
<text>The alphabet of human thought () is a concept originally proposed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz that provides a universal way to represent and analyze ideas and relationships by breaking down their component pieces. All ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which can be represented by a unique character.

== Overview ==
Logic was Leibniz&#x27;s earliest philosophic interest, going back to his teens. René Descartes had suggested that the lexicon of a universal language should consist of primitive elements. The systematic combination of these elements, according to syntactical rules, would generate the infinite combinations of computational structures required to represent human language. In this way Descartes and Leibniz were precursors to computational linguistics as defined by Noam Chomsky.

In the early 18th century, Leibniz outlined his &quot;characteristica universalis&quot;, an artificial language in which grammatical and logical structure would coincide, allowing reasoning to be reduced to calculation. Leibniz acknowledged the work of Ramon Llull, particularly the &quot;Ars generalis ultima&quot; (1305), as one of the inspirations for this idea. The basic elements of his &quot;characteristica&quot; would be pictographic characters unambiguously representing a limited number of elementary concepts. Leibniz called the inventory of these concepts &quot;the alphabet of human thought.&quot; There are quite a few mentions of the &quot;characteristica&quot; in Leibniz&#x27;s writings, but he never set out any details save for a brief outline of some possible sentences in his &quot;Dissertation on the Art of Combinations&quot;.

His main interest was what is known in modern logic as classification and composition. In modern terminology, Leibniz&#x27;s alphabet was a proposal for an automated theorem prover or ontology classification reasoner written centuries before the technology to implement them.

== Semantic web implementation ==
John Giannandrea, co-founder and CTO of Metaweb Technologies, acknowledged in a 2008 speech that Freebase was at least linked to the alphabet of human thought, if not an implementation of it.

<text>Alas Chiricanas (Spanish: &quot;Chiriquí Wings&quot;) was a commuter airline based in Panama, which was operational from 1980 to 1995.

== Fleet ==
Their fleet contained Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirantes, although they also operated the Dash 7 in fierce competition with Aeroperlas, a Panamanian regional airline.

==Accidents and incidents==
In 1994, Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901 exploded while en route from Colón to Panama City. All 18 passengers and 3 crew were killed. The explosion was caused by a bomb.

The aircraft is said to have crashed on a wooded hillside following an in-flight explosion. Twelve Jewish businessmen were among the passengers.

After the accident, the company went out of business, and Aeroperlas absorbed part of its fleet.

<doc id="722166" wikidata="Q1228825" url="?curid=722166" title="Discordian calendar">
<text>The Discordian or Erisian calendar is an alternative calendar used by some adherents of Discordianism. It is specified on page 00034 of the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;.

The Discordian year 1 YOLD is 1166 BC. (Elsewhere in the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, it is mentioned that the Curse of Greyface occurred in 1166 BC. As a reference, AD 2025 is YOLD, Year of Our Lady of Discord.) The abbreviation &quot;YOLD&quot; is not used in the &quot;Principia&quot;, though the phrase &quot;Year of Our Lady of Discord&quot; is mentioned once.

==Composition==
As described in the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, the Discordian calendar has five 73-day seasons: , , , Bureaucracy, and . The Discordian year is aligned with the Gregorian calendar and begins on January 1, thus Chaos 1, YOLD is January 1, 2025 Gregorian.

The Erisian week consists of five days: Sweetmorn, Boomtime, Pungenday, Prickle-Prickle, and Setting Orange. The days of the week are named after the five basic Discordian elements: Sweet, Boom, Pungent, Prickle, and Orange. There are 73 of these weeks per year and every year begins with Sweetmorn.

Every fourth year in the Discordian calendar, starting in 2 YOLD, an extra day is inserted between Chaos 59 and Chaos 60 called St. Tib&#x27;s Day. This is because 4 years + 1 day = 5, a holy number, but the Discordian leap year also coincides with the Gregorian one. The result of this is that any given day of the year in the Discordian calendar may be taken to correspond to the same day of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and vice versa, although some users of the calendar believe that it is tied to the Julian calendar and so will diverge from the Gregorian in 3266 YOLD (AD 2100). St. Tib&#x27;s Day is considered outside the Discordian week.

There are Apostle Holydays on the 5th day of each season, named after the 5 Discordian apostles: Mungday, for Hung Mung; Mojoday, for Dr. Van Van Mojo; Syaday, for Sri Syadasti; Zaraday, for Zarathud; and Maladay, for Malaclypse the Elder. There are also Season Holydays on the 50th of each season: Chaoflux, Discoflux, Confuflux, Bureflux, and Afflux.

Only these eleven dates are named in the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;; however, Discordians have felt free to invent other holidays which have become popular to varying degrees. Some of these include Discordians for Jesus/Love Your Neighbor Day (March 25/Discord 11); Jake Day (April 6/Discord 23 or occasionally May 23/Discord 70), a day to send tongue-in-cheek letters, emails or faxes to an official or bureaucracy; Saint Camping&#x27;s Day (May 21/Discord 68), a day to make End of Days predictions and share them in social media; Eris Day (May 23/Discord 70), a day to gather and celebrate Goddess; Towel Day (May 25/Discord 72); Mid Year&#x27;s Day (July 2/Confusion 37); X-Day (July 5/Confusion 40); and Multiversal Underwear Day (August 10/Bureaucracy 3).

==Implementations==
ddate is a program that prints the current date in the Discordian calendar. It was a part of the util-linux package containing basic system utilities. As such, it had been included at least since 1994 in nearly all Linux distributions. In August 2011 however, one of the maintainers of util-linux made ddate optional, and by default omitted.
In October 2012, ddate was completely removed from util-linux.
The ddate program now has an upstream source. There was some controversy, but in the end, anyone wishing to reintroduce ddate to a distribution will have to create a separate package based on the new upstream. This has been done for Debian, FreeBSD, Fedora Linux,
and Gentoo Linux for example.

There are many other programs with similar functionality, such as Hodge Podge, an Android widget. Discordian-calendar is an implementation using Java 8&#x27;s date and time classes.

<doc id="722199" wikidata="Q7866589" url="?curid=722199" title="USNS Kingsport">
<text>USNS &quot;Kingsport&quot; (T-AG-164) was built as SS &quot;Kingsport Victory, a [[United States Maritime Commission]] VC2-S-AP3 ([[Victory ship|Victory]]) type cargo ship. During the closing days of [[World War II]] the ship was operated by the [[American Hawaiian Steamship Company]] under an agreement with the [[War Shipping Administration]]. After a period of layup the ship was operated asUSAT &quot;Kingsport Victory by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948. When Army transports were transferred to the Navy&#x27;s Military Sea Transportation Service the ship continued as USNS &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; (T-AK-239), a cargo transport . On 14 November 1961, after conversion into the first satellite communication ship, the ship was renamed &quot;Kingsport&quot;, reclassified as a general auxiliary, and operated as USNS &quot;Kingsport&quot; (T-AG-164).

The ship was sent to Lagos, Nigeria as the control station for Syncom 2 becoming the site of the first two way call by satellite by heads of state. The call was between Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard the &quot;Kingsport&quot; and President John F. Kennedy on 23 August 1963. In 1967 the ship underwent conversion and became a bathymetric and acoustic survey ship for the installation and maintenance of the then classified Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) under the unclassified name of Project Caesar,

==Construction==
&quot;Kingsport Victory&quot;, a United States Maritime Commission VC2-S-AP3 (Victory) type cargo ship, was laid down 4 April 1944 with launch on 29 May and completion on 12 July 1944 with delivery to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on the same day at Los Angeles. She was built under the Emergency Shipbuilding program under cognizance of the U.S. Maritime Commission. Basic dimensions, not counting modifications for satellite communications, were length (LBP), beam and .

== World War II and Army service==
&quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; was immediately placed in operation by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, under a War Shipping Administration general agency agreement, supplying troops in the Pacific. She made trips between California and Pearl Harbor. On 17 October 1944 she steamed from California, arriving at Milne Bay in New Guinea on 2 November. She carried cargo to US troops and ships at Eniwetok, Iwo Jima, Guam, Ulithi atoll and Okinawa. &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; was active delivering support for the Battle of Iwo Jima from 19 February to 26 March 1945. In battle she had to use her deck guns to defend against air attacks. &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; received one Battle star for her service. After the war, in December 1945 she steamed from Okinawa to Hong Kong, then Calcutta; through the Suez Canal she arrived at New York City on 27 February 1946. During 1946 she moved cargo from the US east and west coasts.

After the war, on 29 September 1947, she was taken out of service and placed in the reserve fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia. On 8 April 1948 the ship was taken out of reserve and bareboat chartered to the War Department for operation as the USAT &quot;&quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; a US Army Transport. During this time the ship was involved in a legal case, &quot;Johansen, v. United States&quot;, involving rights of an Army civil service employee crew member in personal injury cases. On 1 March 1950 she was removed from US Army Transport and transferred the US Navy.

==Navy MSTS service==
&quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; was among large Army ships transferred to the Navy&#x27;s Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) with &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; being transferred effective 1 March 1950. The ship carried military cargo for the next eleven years as USNS &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; (T-AK-239) as a &quot;Greenville Victory&quot;-class cargo ship. &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot; is seen in an Air Force documentary film on the construction of the Dew Line loading supplies at Norfolk, Virginia and unloading at Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS &quot;Kingsport&quot; was further modified and, in August 1963 while in Lagos harbor, transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when John F. Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard &quot;Kingsport&quot; spoke in a two-way call. A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington. The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with &quot;Kingsport&quot; which was off Morocco. Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. &quot;Kingsport&quot; then supported Project Gemini into March 1966. After conversion from satellite configuration, particularly removal of the large and very visible dome, &quot;Kingsport&quot; was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs.

===Satellite communications ship &quot;Kingsport&quot;===
On 24 September 1961, she was delivered to the Portland, Oregon facilities of Willamette Iron &amp; Steel Company where she underwent conversion to become the first satellite communications ship. On 14 November 1961 she was renamed &quot;Kingsport&quot; and reclassified AG-164.

Designed for use by the United States Army Satellite Communications Agency in the defense satellite communications programs, Project ADVENT, USNS &quot;Kingsport&quot; underwent extensive alteration during conversion. A special high frequency radio station was installed for ship-to-shore communications. She received advanced tracking and telemetry equipment and anti-roll stabilization tanks. In addition, a 30-foot, gyro-stabilized, computer-oriented, triaxial, parabolic antenna was installed on her afterdeck. Housed in a 53-foot, plastic, air-pressurized radome, this antenna permitted precision tracking of a high altitude satellite at any angle above the horizon.
&quot;Kingsport&quot; sailed to Lagos, Nigeria after Syncom 2 had been successfully launched on 26 July 1963 to serve as the terminal control station during testing and evaluation of the satellite. On 23 August 1963, President John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C., telephoned Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard the &quot;Kingsport&quot; docked in Lagos Harbor via Syncom 2, the first geosynchronous communication satellite. It was the first live two-way call between heads of state by satellite. Syncom 2 and Relay 1 linked Nigeria, Brazil and the United States with &quot;Kingsport&quot; transmitting through Syncom 2 to New Jersey and New Jersey via Relay 1 to Rio de Janeiro. During this period Gulf of Guinea oceanographic data, composed of depths temperature and salinity from a station, were transmitted from the to the National Oceanographic Data Center via &quot;Kingsport&quot; and Syncom 2.

&quot;Kingsport&quot; departed Lagos 23 September and during transit off Morocco on 2 October demonstrated the first satellite communications between an aircraft in flight when a Navy aircraft off the Virginia coast made voice contact with the ship via satellite. The ship reached Rota, Spain on 3 October, staying until 6 October, then sailed supporting communication tests in the Mediterranean from 7 to 25 October. Tests of voice and teletype links between the United States and ships of the 6th Fleet successful with the ship visiting Leghorn, Italy and Beirut, Lebanon during the voyage. After arriving in Rota 26 October and completing additional experiments she sailed for Norfolk 9 November and arrived 21 November.

&quot;Kingsport&quot; departed for the Pacific 17 February 1964 via Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal stopping at San Diego 13 March and reaching Pearl Harbor on 25 March 1964. For the next ten months the ship operated between Pearl Harbor and Guam supporting further communication experiments including those related to the evaluation of SYNCOM 3 after its launching 19 August 1964. Further experiments extended throughout the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean until July 1965.

She then provided support for NASA&#x27;s Gemini crewed space shots serving as on station communications ship between Okinawa and the Philippines for Gemini 5 from 21 to 29 August. She supported three more Gemini flights between 4 December and 16 March 1966 before returning to the West Coast in April. She remained at San Francisco from 18 April to 27 October in a ready reserve status. During November she steamed to the East Coast, and in early 1967 was at New York undergoing repairs and alterations.

After completion of her communications support role the USNS &quot;Kingsport&quot; became a bathymetric and acoustic survey ship supporting Project Caesar, the installation and maintenance of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), and undersea surveillance development. The ship was part of the &quot;Caeasr fleet&quot; under the technical control of the project&#x27;s Program Manager, then Naval Electronics Systems Command (NAVELEX PME-124). Among the now published reports, declassified in 2006, of the ship&#x27;s work is a description of the Indian Ocean exercise code named BEARING STAKE that took place from January to April 1977.

==Disposal==
Kingsport was placed out of service on 31 Jan 1984, transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup on 29 August 1984 then transferred back to the Military Sealift Command for scientific research on 1 March 1990. The ship was withdrawn from the reserve fleet on 21 January 1992 for scrapping in India.

==Honors==
Crew of Naval Armed Guard on the SS &quot;Kingsport Victory&quot;&#x27; earned &quot;Battle Stars&quot; in World War II for war action during the assault occupation of Assault occupation of Iwo Jima from 13 March 1945 to 16 March 1945.

<text>San de Fuca is an unincorporated community and geographical location on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, United States. Formerly a small town in the 19th century, it lies on the north side of Penn Cove across from Coupeville.

San de Fuca was envisioned as the terminus of a shipping channel across Whidbey Island, which would connect to Anacortes by rail. The site was said in 1890 to have &quot;no possible rival as the most desirable and advantageous point for a general railroad terminus and point of interchange for land and water traffic.&quot; The planned canal was ultimately cancelled due to the Panic of 1893. Nonetheless, San de Fuca remained a stop on steamer lines carrying passengers to and from Seattle for several decades. The San de Fuca hotel remained standing until at least 1970, and the historic San de Fuca pier (built 1911) was still standing as of 2014.

<text>Stunt Copter is a monochrome Macintosh action game written by Duane Blehm and published by his Kansas-based company, HomeTown Software, in 1986.

==Gameplay==
The game involves piloting a small helicopter around a playfield. The player has to position the helicopter and drop a person suspended from the aircraft onto a hay bale or moving cart. If incorrectly timed, the person might fall onto the ground or injure the horse or the driver of the cart.

==Legacy==
After his death, his parents released his games and source code into the public domain.

&quot;MacAddict&quot; magazine used &quot;Stunt Copter&quot; to demonstrate software compatibility of Mac OS X public beta. An OS X version was released by Antell Software.

An iPhone version was released by nerdgames in 2009. In 2011, an iPad version of &quot;Stunt Copter&quot; was released by Apollo Software which is similar to the original.

In 2018, a collection of his games were uploaded to the Internet Archive and made playable in a web browser.

== History ==
===Formation and growth ===
The company Gebrüder Sulzer, Foundry in Winterthur was founded in 1834 by Johann Jacob Sulzer. His sons, Johann Jakob and Salomon produced cast iron and built fire extinguishers, pumps and apparatus for the textile industry; later, they also started installing heaters. In 1836 the workforce grew to some forty journeymen, subworkers and apprentices. In 1839, a foundry was added, a mechanical workshop was set up, and the first steam engine was built and installed in Winterthur (1841). In 1845, the company&#x27;s own &quot;Sick Support Association for Factory Workers&quot; was founded. This later became the Sulzer Health Insurance Fund; this was renamed Provita in 1997 and now operates as an independent health insurance fund as part of the SWICA insurance company. In 1851, English engineer Charles Brown joined Sulzer. With the development of new steam engines, he was instrumental for the early success and growth of the company. In 1859, the first &quot;partnership agreement&quot; between the Sulzer brothers was signed. New products were introduced, first steam engines, later also ships, a new organization and production methods. In approximately 1860, Sulzer opened its first foreign sales office in Turin, and the company participated in the world exhibition in Paris in 1867. The workforce had grown by then to more than 1,000 workers.

In 1870, Switzerland&#x27;s first company-owned vocational school with training workshops was founded. In 1872, 24 workers&#x27; dwellings were built in Winterthur by the “Gesellschaft für Erstellung billiger Wohnhäuser” (Society for Affordable Housing Construction). Further apartment buildings in addition to private homes followed in other parts of Winterthur.

From 1880, steam engines particularly contributed to the growth of Sulzer to around 2,000 employees. In 1881 a branch was founded in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany. In 1898, the first Sulzer diesel engine was developed in cooperation with Rudolf Diesel. By approximately 1900, the company had over 3,000 employees and sales offices in Milan, Paris, Cairo, London, Moscow and Bucharest, as well as the Japanese city of Kobe from 1914.

As a family business, the company had grown over the years in the form of a general partnership, and in June 1914 it was converted into two stock corporations with registered offices in Winterthur and Ludwigshafen am Rhein, both of which were renamed Gebrüder Sulzer Aktiengesellschaft. In 1917, both companies were bundled in a holding structure under the name Sulzer-Unternehmungen AG and subsequently the foreign sales offices were also transferred to independent companies. Sulzer initiates Switzerland’s first regularly published in-house magazine in 1919. At the same time, the technical customer magazine “Technische Rundschau Sulzer” (later “Sulzer Technical Review”) was launched.

During the 1930s, production fell by two thirds as a result of the global economic crisis, and personnel was massively reduced.

===World War II===
Out of political and personal considerations, Sulzer decided to sell its subsidiaries in Germany by the beginning of the war.

Sulzer was blacklisted by the Allies during World War II due to an increase in trade with Axis countries. Sulzer refused to sign an agreement to limit the future sale of marine diesel engines to the Axis countries, and was blacklisted by the Allies as a result.

===Postwar period===
From 1945, a growth phase began with a flourishing economy and strong expansion of foreign activities. In the 1950s, increasing production was carried out by guest workers, mainly from southern Europe. New divisions for energy, plant engineering and textile machinery were created, accompanied by better working conditions, expansion of social benefits, women&#x27;s work for &quot;lighter factory work&quot; and housing subsidies in surrounding communities.

During the second heyday after the Second World War, the Sulzer Tower was built in the early 1960s - the company&#x27;s new headquarters, a landmark of Winterthur and at 99.7 meters the tallest building in Switzerland at the time. It served as Sulzer’s headquarters until 1999, and again from 2012.

In 1961, Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) in Winterthur was acquired, and the large diesel engine became Sulzer&#x27;s flagship product worldwide. In 1966, Sulzer acquired a 53 percent stake in Escher Wyss &amp; Cie. in Zurich, reaching an all-time high of over 30,000 employees. In 1969, Escher Wyss AG was taken over in full.

===Crisis in the 1970s and 1980s===

In the 1970s, the oil crisis announced a new orientation towards the technology group and the development of materials technologies. Sulzer reacted to the global decline in capital goods in the 1970s after losses in the second half of the 1980s. In 1982, the weaving machine business was expanded.

In 1984, the year of its 150th anniversary, Sulzer recorded losses and underwent massive restructuring.

Medical technology was expanded by the purchase of the American Intermedics Group for one billion Swiss francs in 1988. The Winterthur machine factory was closed in 1990 and the founding site in Winterthur was vacated. For the first time, Sulzer employed more people abroad than in Switzerland. On 14 May 1993 Gebrüder Sulzer, Aktiengesellschaft was renamed Sulzer Ltd. In 1996, a technology center was built in the Oberwinterthur Industrial Park.

=== Acquisitions and divestitures around the turn of the millennium ===
In 1997, Sulzer Medica went public, and Sulzer Thermtec (equipment and valves for power plants) was sold to the British IMI.

In 1999, another reorganization took place and Sulzer Industries became independent with its own CEO. The pumps business in China was strengthened by founding a joint venture with Dalian Pumps. The company sold its water turbine business (Sulzer Hydra) to the Austrian technology company VA Tech.

In 2000, Sulzer acquired the Finnish company Ahlstrom Pumps. In the middle of the year, the steam locomotive and machine factory DLM became independent, the remains of the former SLM became Winpro AG in 2001 through a management buyout.

In 2001, patients experienced problems with contaminated hip joint implants from Sulzer Medica in the USA, leading to class action lawsuits. In 2002, Sulzer Medica agreed on a settlement with the US plaintiffs and Sulzer paid 75 million US dollars for the settlement, which caused a massive drop in its share price.

In 2001, Sulzer sold its textile business (Sulzer Textile) to the Italian Promatech Group. Sulzer Medica was separated from the Sulzer company through a spin-off in 2001, renamed to Centerpulse and sold to the US medical company Zimmer in 2003, where it is still managed as a successful business unit. With the sale of the compressor business Burckhardt to its management in 2002, the divestiture program was finished.

===A new start===
The time since 2003 is called a new beginning. Since then, the Group has been smaller but more profitable and has recorded strong growth. Sulzer increased operating income and net income by more than 50 percent.

In the years to come, Sulzer strengthened the market positions of its divisions by several acquisitions. The company’s Metco business acquired the Canadian Ambeon division of Westaim and German OSU Machine Construction in 2004. The same year, Sulzer Pumps took over the Johnston, Crown, and Paco pump activities from Precision Castparts Corp. (PCC), located in Houston, Texas, USA, and in Wuxi, China. Sulzer Chemtech acquired US Cana-Tex in 2005, strengthening its field services for separation columns, Swiss companies Mixpac, Werfo and Mold in 2006 to expand static mixing activities, followed by the separation business of UK-based KnitMesh Ltd in 2007 and several tower field service companies in Australia, Thailand, India, Germany in 2009 and Canada in 2011. Sulzer’s service business (Turbo Services) expanded its business in South America in 2008 with the acquisition of Capime.

In 2005, a Swiss-government sponsored historical study authored by historian Peter Hug revealed that Sulzer provided fissile material in the 1970s for the South African nuclear weapons program. Following discussions with the Division of Trade of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Sulzer said to only supply important parts for uranium enrichment plants to South Africa on condition that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be allowed to surveil South Africa. Otherwise, the company would only deliver non-sensitive equipment. Meanwhile, the Swiss Federation of Commerce and Industry intervened in the debate and indirectly exerted pressure in favor of admitting the deal. Later, when it became known that compressors had been supplied to an enrichment plant in South Africa, Sulzer claimed its South African subsidiary, over which it did not exert any control legally, might have supplied such compressors and that Sulzer had not been informed about that.

In 2007, the Viennese investors Ronny Pecik and Georg Stumpf together with the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg acquired a majority stake in Sulzer. None of these investors had ever filed a disclosure statement with Sulzer before. This surprising entry drew the longest investigation by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), at the end of which a charge of breach of disclosure obligations resulted. The investors had taken advantage of a loophole in Swiss capital market regulations and, through the improper use of formally cash-settled options, had granted themselves potential control over voting rights attached to shares or conveyed by options with real settlement. FINMA also found that Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), Deutsche Bank AG Zweigniederlassung Zürich (DBZ) and NZB Neue Zürcher Bank (NZB) had, in some cases, seriously breached their regulatory obligations in connection with the issuance or trading of these options.

In 2010, Sulzer acquired Dowding &amp; Mills, a provider of maintenance and repair services for generators and engines, and renamed it Sulzer Electro Mechanical Services.

In spring 2011, Sulzer announced the acquisition of the Cardo Flow Solutions pump division of the Swedish company Assa Abloy for CHF 858 million, thus strengthening the Sulzer Pumps division in the water and wastewater market. The deal added the ABS and Scanpumps brands to Sulzer&#x27;s workforce with 1,800 new employees.

In July 2013, Sulzer announced its intention to divest the fourth division &quot;Sulzer Metco&quot; to focus on its core markets. The purpose was also to fund new acquisitions and to grow production capacity. In June 2014, the sale of &quot;Sulzer Metco&quot; to the Swiss Oerlikon was completed.

In 2017, Sulzer bought French pump manufacturer Ensival Moret to close specific product gaps (such as axial flow pumps) in its general industry pumps portfolio. The company also acquired control of Rotec’s gas turbine service business (Rotec GT) in Russia, becoming a sizeable player in the Russian gas turbine service market. The same year, Sulzer’s Chemtech division bought Wärtsilä’s oil separation technology business (VIEC – Vessel Internal Electrostatic Coalescer), based in Norway.

After two years with three divisions, Sulzer added a fourth division to its reporting structure at the beginning of 2017. Since then, the Sulzer Mixpac Systems unit, which has been manufacturing applicators for industrial adhesives since 2006, has formed the new Applicator Systems Division together with the acquired beauty business Geka (bought in 2016), industrial dispensers provider PC Cox (2016), dental applicators producer Transcodent (2017), healthcare dispensing/mixing products supplier Medmix (2018), and drug delivery devices manufacturer Haselmeier (2020).

In 2018, Sulzer acquired US company JWC Environmental, LLC, a provider of solids reduction and removal products such as grinders, screens and dissolved air flotation system for municipal, industrial and commercial wastewater applications. The transaction allowed Sulzer to grow its wastewater treatment segment.

Also in 2018, Sulzer took over Brithinee Electric of Colton, California, expanding its electromechanical services business into Southern California to serve the wind, cement and water markets.

Although Sulzer was not directly listed on OFAC&#x27;s sanctions list in April 2018, it was negatively affected by them because Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg controlled 63.42% of the industrial conglomerate through Renova, a financial company he controls. In order to avoid Sulzer being indirectly exposed to US sanctions, the company submitted a request to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to take over five million shares from Renova, which was granted on 11 April. In this way, Vekselberg&#x27;s shareholding fell to just below 50%, which no longer corresponded to a majority. With this measure, Sulzer was able to free itself from the sphere of influence of the American sanctions within a few days. On 12 April 2018 the company reported, &quot;Transfer of shares completed - Renova ownership below 50% - Sulzer free from US sanctions.&quot;

With the acquisition of the US-headquartered GTC Technology in April 2019, Sulzer complemented its Chemtech offering with proprietary processes and systems for the production of aromatics and other petrochemicals. This acquisition enabled Sulzer to get into the technology licensing business, thus making Sulzer’s business less cyclical.

Sulzer grew its aftermarket activities in July 2019 through the acquisition of Alba Power, a service provider for aeroderivative gas turbines. By diversifying its service offering, Sulzer reduced its end-market exposure to the challenging utility power sector. 

In 2020, Sulzer acquired Swiss-German Haselmeier, providing the company access to the highly attractive drug-delivery devices market with self-injection pens for reproductive health, diabetes or osteoporosis patients.

In January 2021, Sulzer bought Nordic Water, a leading supplier of water-treatment technology. The acquisition strengthened Sulzer’s wastewater treatment offering and gave further access to the clean water market, where Sulzer has already been present for years.

In September 2021, Sulzer spun off Medmix as a completely separate firm, thereby narrowing Sulzer to a flow-control company focused on the Water and Renewables markets.

==Rail traction==

Sulzer developed a series of rail traction engines in the 1930s and 1940s which were used extensively in diesel locomotives in the UK, Europe and South America. A small number were used in locomotives in Africa and Australia. The Sulzer LDA (prefixed by the number of cylinders, and with a suffix related to the cylinder bore) engine was widely used by British Rail and Romanian Railways. Many were built under licence by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow as six-, eight- and twelve-cylinder form, and in Romania, by Reșița works for Electroputere Craiova. The twelve-cylinder engine was used in the British Rail Class 47, Romanian Railways Class 60/62, Polish Railways Class ST43, China Railways ND2, and several others. The 12LDA28 engine was a double bank engine having, in effect, two six-cylinder engines side by side, rather than a V-type as favoured by many other manufacturers. Sulzer V-type engines for rail use bore the type number LVA (with a 50-degree angle between the banks).

In the late 1970s, locomotive rebuilder Morrison Knudsen installed a series of Sulzer power units into several existing locomotives. The first applications were of the marine based 6ASL25/30 &amp; 8ASL25/30 series used in a Morrison-Knudsen demonstrator and four M-K TE70-4S units for the Southern Pacific. This was merely reworking of an existing design into a new application

Ten 16 ASV25/30 power units were installed into locomotives belonging to the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe and the Union Pacific. Teething problems plagued these machines and their operation in revenue earning service was brief. Research into correcting their problems continued but was eventually curtailed by Morrison Knudsen late in 1982. These power units were descendants of the LVA range.

==New Sulzer Diesel==
In 1990, Sulzer spun off the diesel engine division into a separate company named &quot;New Sulzer Diesel&quot; (NSD) and sold most of the shares in it, retaining only a minority ownership. In 1997, NSD was absorbed by Wärtsilä, creating &quot;Wärtsilä NSD&quot;. Wärtsilä NSD makes the world&#x27;s largest diesel engine, the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C. They are also one of the few companies that create a camshaftless intelligent diesel main propulsion engine.

<doc id="722222" wikidata="Q4931397" url="?curid=722222" title="Select board">
<text>The select board or board of selectmen is commonly the executive arm of the government of New England towns in the United States. The board typically consists of three or five members, with or without staggered terms. Three is the most common number, historically.

==History==
In most New England towns, the adult voting population gathered annually in a town meeting to act as the local legislature, approving budgets and laws. Day-to-day operations were originally left to individual oversight, but when towns became too large for individuals to handle such work loads, they would elect an executive board of selected men (hence the name) to run things for them.

These men had charge of the day-to-day operations; selectmen were important in legislating policies central to a community&#x27;s police force, highway supervisors, poundkeepers, field drivers, and other officials. However, the larger towns grew, the more power would be distributed among other elected boards, such as fire wardens and police departments. For example, population increases led to the creation of police departments, of which selectmen typically became the commissioners. The advent of tarred roads and automobile traffic led to a need for full-time highway maintainers and plowmen, leaving selectmen to serve as Supervisors of Streets and Ways.

==Present==
The function of the board of selectmen differs from state to state, and can differ within a given state depending on the type of governance under which a town operates. Selectmen almost always serve part-time, with a token or no salary. It is the chief executive branch of local government in the open town meeting form of government.

The basic function consists of calling town meetings, proposing budgets to the town meeting, setting public policy, calling elections, licensing, setting certain fees, overseeing certain volunteer and appointed bodies, and creating basic regulations.

In larger towns, the selectmen&#x27;s daily administrative duties are delegated to a full-time town administrator or town manager. In some towns, the board of selectmen acts more like a city council, but retains the historic name.

In some places, such as Connecticut, the board is headed by a first selectman, who historically has served as the chief administrative officer of the town and may be elected separately from the rest of the board.

In New Hampshire cities (which have a board of aldermen instead of a board of selectmen), a &quot;selectman&quot; is an elected position that is responsible for organizing elections for local, state, and federal offices. Three selectmen, a moderator, and a clerk are elected in each city ward.

In Vermont towns, per state statute the Selectboard performs several ex officio roles to include: serving as the local Board of Health, Board of Liquor Control Commissioners, Board of Sewage System Commissioners; and together with the town&#x27;s elected Justices of the Peace, serve as the Board of Civil Authority and Board of Tax Abatement.

A rare use of the term outside New England is in Georgetown, Colorado, where the town governing body is called the Board of Selectmen.

==First selectman==
The first selectman (or selectwoman) is the head of the board of selectmen in some New England towns.

Historically, the first selectman was the one who received the largest number of votes during municipal elections or at a town meeting. More recently most towns have chosen to elect the first selectman in a separate election, much like a mayor.

While the principle remains the same in most towns, the function has evolved differently. Traditionally, the first selectman acts as chief administrative officer. As with all politicians in New England, it was originally a part-time position. Most modern towns that have part-time first selectmen limit their function to chairing the board of selectmen and performing certain ceremonial duties. Actual administration of the town is handled by the town manager. In other towns, the first selectman acts as CEO of the town, much like a mayor, alone or in conjunction with a town manager who acts as a chief administrative officer.

In Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, the presiding selectman is usually called the chairman and is chosen annually by the selectmen. In Vermont, immediately following the annual election, the Board of Selectmen is required by state statute to re-organize, which includes electing a chair, appointing various town positions, and establishing the meeting schedule for the ensuing year.

In New Hampshire cities, selectmen maintain voter checklists and aid voters at the polls.

In Connecticut, the first selectman is the chief executive and administrative officer of most towns with the Selectmen-Town Meeting form of government. Some towns, such as Woodbridge, elect their first selectmen to be the chief administrative officer of the town even though the position is technically part-time. The first selectman is also a voting member of the board of selectmen and can cast a tie-breaking vote in the board of finance. In other towns, the position is full-time. In towns such as Beacon Falls, Bethany, Brookfield, Orange, and Simsbury, the losing first selectman candidate can earn a seat on the board of selectmen, depending on the number of votes the losing candidate received.

<doc id="722235" wikidata="Q498792" url="?curid=722235" title="Hill sphere">
<text>The Hill sphere is a common model for the calculation of a gravitational sphere of influence. It is the most commonly used model to calculate the spatial extent of gravitational influence of an astronomical body (&quot;m&quot;) in which it dominates over the gravitational influence of other bodies, particularly a primary (&quot;M&quot;). It is sometimes confused with other models of gravitational influence, such as the Laplace sphere or being named the Roche sphere, the latter causing confusion with the Roche limit. It was defined by the American astronomer George William Hill, based on the work of the French astronomer Édouard Roche.

To be retained by a more gravitationally attracting astrophysical object—a planet by a more massive star, a moon by a more massive planet—the less massive body must have an orbit that lies within the gravitational potential represented by the more massive body&#x27;s Hill sphere. That moon would, in turn, have a Hill sphere of its own, and any object within that distance would tend to become a satellite of the moon, rather than of the planet itself.

One simple view of the extent of the Solar System is that it is bounded by the Hill sphere of the Sun (engendered by the Sun&#x27;s interaction with the galactic nucleus or other more massive stars). A more complex example is the one at right, the Earth&#x27;s Hill sphere, which extends between the Lagrange points and , which lie along the line of centers of the Earth and the more massive Sun. The gravitational influence of the less massive body is least in that direction, and so it acts as the limiting factor for the size of the Hill sphere; beyond that distance, a third object in orbit around the Earth would spend at least part of its orbit outside the Hill sphere, and would be progressively perturbed by the tidal forces of the more massive body, the Sun, eventually ending up orbiting the latter.

For two massive bodies with gravitational potentials and any given energy of a third object of negligible mass interacting with them, one can define a zero-velocity surface in space which cannot be passed, the contour of the Jacobi integral. When the object&#x27;s energy is low, the zero-velocity surface completely surrounds the less massive body (of this restricted three-body system), which means the third object cannot escape; at higher energy, there will be one or more gaps or bottlenecks by which the third object may escape the less massive body and go into orbit around the more massive one. If the energy is at the border between these two cases, then the third object cannot escape, but the zero-velocity surface confining it touches a larger zero-velocity surface around the less massive body at one of the nearby Lagrange points, forming a cone-like point there. At the opposite side of the less massive body, the zero-velocity surface gets close to the other Lagrange point.
==Definition==

The Hill radius or sphere (the latter defined by the former radius) has been described as &quot;the region around a planetary body where its own gravity (compared to that of the Sun or other nearby bodies) is the dominant force in attracting satellites,&quot; both natural and artificial.

As described by de Pater and Lissauer, all bodies within a system such as the Sun&#x27;s Solar System &quot;feel the gravitational force of one another&quot;, and while the motions of just two gravitationally interacting bodies—constituting a &quot;two-body problem&quot;—are &quot;completely integrable ([meaning]...there exists one independent integral or constraint per degree of freedom)&quot; and thus an exact, analytic solution, the interactions of &quot;three&quot; (or more) such bodies &quot;cannot be deduced analytically&quot;, requiring instead solutions by numerical integration, when possible. This is the case, unless the negligible mass of one of the three bodies allows approximation of the system as a two-body problem, known formally as a &quot;restricted three-body problem&quot;.

For such two- or restricted three-body problems as its simplest examples—e.g., one more massive primary astrophysical body, mass of m1, and a less massive secondary body, mass of m2—the concept of a Hill radius or sphere is of the approximate limit to the secondary mass&#x27;s &quot;gravitational dominance&quot;, a limit defined by &quot;the extent&quot; of its Hill sphere, which is represented mathematically as follows:
:formula_1,
where, in this representation, major axis &quot;a&quot; can be understood as the &quot;instantaneous heliocentric distance&quot; between the two masses (elsewhere abbreviated &quot;r&quot;).

More generally, if the less massive body, formula_2, orbits a more massive body (m1, e.g., as a planet orbiting around the Sun) and has a semi-major axis formula_3, and an eccentricity of formula_4, then the Hill radius or sphere, formula_5 of the less massive body, calculated at the pericenter, is approximately:
:formula_6

When eccentricity is negligible (the most favourable case for orbital stability), this expression reduces to the one presented above.
== Example and derivation ==
In the Earth-Sun example, the Earth () orbits the Sun () at a distance of 149.6 million km, or one astronomical unit (AU). The Hill sphere for Earth thus extends out to about 1.5 million km (0.01 AU). The Moon&#x27;s orbit, at a distance of 0.384 million km from Earth, is comfortably within the gravitational sphere of influence of Earth and it is therefore not at risk of being pulled into an independent orbit around the Sun.

The earlier eccentricity-ignoring formula can be re-stated as follows:
:formula_7, or formula_8,
where M is the sum of the interacting masses.

=== Derivation ===

The expression for the Hill radius can be found by equating gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on a test particle (of mass much smaller than formula_9) orbiting the secondary body. Assume that the distance between masses formula_10 and formula_9 is formula_12, and that the test particle is orbiting at a distance formula_13 from the secondary. When the test particle is on the line connecting the primary and the secondary body, the force balance requires that

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the gravitational constant and formula_16 is the (Keplerian) angular velocity of the secondary about the primary (assuming that formula_17). The above equation can also be written as

:formula_18

which, through a binomial expansion to leading order in formula_19, can be written as

:formula_20
Hence, the relation stated above

:formula_21

If the orbit of the secondary about the primary is elliptical, the Hill radius is maximum at the apocenter, where formula_12 is largest, and minimum at the pericenter of the orbit. Therefore, for purposes of stability of test particles (for example, of small satellites), the Hill radius at the pericenter distance needs to be considered.

To leading order in formula_19, the Hill radius above also represents the distance of the Lagrangian point L1 from the secondary.

== Regions of stability ==

The Hill sphere is only an approximation, and other forces (such as radiation pressure or the Yarkovsky effect) can eventually perturb an object out of the sphere. As stated, the satellite (third mass) should be small enough that its gravity contributes negligibly.

The region of stability for retrograde orbits at a large distance from the primary is larger than the region for prograde orbits at a large distance from the primary. This was thought to explain the preponderance of retrograde moons around Jupiter; however, Saturn has a more even mix of retrograde/prograde moons so the reasons are more complicated.
In a two planet system, the mutual hill radius of the two planets must exceed formula_24 to be stable. Multi-planet systems of three or more with semi-major-axis differences of less than ten mutual hill radii are always unstable. This is due to the loss of angular momentum due to perturbations by a third planet.

== Further examples ==

It is possible for a Hill sphere to be so small that it is impossible to maintain an orbit around a body. For example, an astronaut could not have orbited the 104 ton Space Shuttle at an orbit 300 km above the Earth, because a 104-ton object at that altitude has a Hill sphere of only 120 cm in radius, much smaller than a Space Shuttle. A sphere of this size and mass would be denser than lead, and indeed, in low Earth orbit, a spherical body must be more dense than lead in order to fit inside its own Hill sphere, or else it will be incapable of supporting an orbit. Satellites further out in geostationary orbit, however, would only need to be more than 6% of the density of water to fit inside their own Hill sphere.

Within the Solar System, the planet with the largest Hill radius is Neptune, with 116 million km, or 0.775 au; its great distance from the Sun amply compensates for its small mass relative to Jupiter (whose own Hill radius measures 53 million km). An asteroid from the asteroid belt will have a Hill sphere that can reach 220,000 km (for 1 Ceres), diminishing rapidly with decreasing mass. The Hill sphere of 66391 Moshup, a Mercury-crossing asteroid that has a moon (named Squannit), measures 22 km in radius.

A typical extrasolar &quot;hot Jupiter&quot;, HD 209458 b, has a Hill sphere radius of 593,000 km, about eight times its physical radius of approx 71,000 km. Even the smallest close-in extrasolar planet, CoRoT-7b, still has a Hill sphere radius (61,000 km), six times its physical radius (approx 10,000 km). Therefore, these planets could have small moons close in, although not within their respective Roche limits.

<text>The Massachusetts House of Representatives is the lower house of the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts. It is composed of 160 members elected from 14 counties each divided into single-member electoral districts across the Commonwealth. The House of Representatives convenes at the Massachusetts State House in Boston, the state capital of Massachusetts.

==Qualifications==
Any person seeking to get elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives must meet the following qualifications:
* Be at least 18 years of age
* Be a registered voter in Massachusetts
* Be an inhabitant of the district for at least one year prior to election
* Receive at least 150 signatures on nomination papers

==Representation==
Originally, representatives were apportioned by town. For the first 150 persons, one representative was granted, and this ratio increased as the population of the town increased. The largest membership of the House was 749 in 1812 (214 of these being from the District of Maine); the largest House without Maine was 635 in 1837. The original distribution was changed to the current regional population system in the 20th century. Until 1978, there were 240 members of the house, a number in multi-member districts; today there are 160 in single-member districts.

Districts are named for the counties they are in and tend to stay within one county, although districts often cross county lines. Representatives serve two-year terms which are not limited.
==The Sacred Cod==

Within the House&#x27;s debating chamber hangs the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts. The pine carving of the cod was offered by Representative John Rowe in 1784 in commemoration of the state&#x27;s maritime economy and history. Two previous carvings of the cod existed during the legislature&#x27;s colonial era; the first destroyed in a fire in 1747, and the second during the American War of Independence. Since 1784, the current Sacred Cod has been present at nearly every House session, and moved to its current location when the House began convening in the State House in 1798.

In 1933, members of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; stole the cod carving as part of a prank. The theft sparked a large statewide search by the Boston and Massachusetts State Police. Following outrage from Boston newspapers and the General Court itself, the cod was anonymously handed back.

==Composition==
The Democrats hold a supermajority in the House.

==Leadership ==

The Speaker of the House presides over the House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus followed by confirmation of the full House through the passage of a House Resolution. As well as presiding over the body, the Speaker is also the chief leader, and controls the flow of legislation. Other House leaders, such as the majority and minority leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses relative to their party&#x27;s strength in the House.

<text>Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community is a 2000 nonfiction book by Robert D. Putnam. It was developed from his 1995 essay entitled &quot;Bowling Alone: America&#x27;s Declining Social Capital&quot;. Putnam surveys the decline of social capital in the United States since 1950. He has described the reduction in all the forms of in-person social intercourse upon which Americans used to found, educate, and enrich the fabric of their social lives. He argues that this undermines the active civic engagement which a strong democracy requires from its citizens.

==Contents==
Putnam discussed ways in which Americans disengaged from community involvement, including decreased voter turnout, attendance at public meetings, service on committees, and work with political parties. Putnam also cited Americans&#x27; growing distrust in their government. Putnam accepted the possibility that this lack of trust could be attributed to &quot;the long litany of political tragedies and scandals since the 1960s&quot;, but believed that this explanation was limited when viewing it alongside other &quot;trends in civic engagement of a wider sort&quot;.

Putnam noted the aggregate loss in membership and number of volunteers in many existing civic organizations such as religious groups (Knights of Columbus, B&#x27;nai Brith, etc.), labor unions, parent–teacher associations, Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, League of Women Voters, military veterans&#x27; organizations, volunteers with Boy Scouts and the Red Cross, and fraternal organizations (Lions Clubs, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, United States Junior Chamber, Freemasonry, Rotary, Kiwanis, etc.). Putnam used bowling as an example to illustrate this; although the number of people who bowled had increased in the last 20 years, the number of people who bowled in leagues had decreased. If people bowled alone, they did not participate in the social interaction and civic discussions that might occur in a league environment.
Putnam cites data from the General Social Survey that showed an aggregate decline in membership of traditional civic organizations, supporting his thesis that U.S. social capital had declined. He noted that some organizations had grown, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, the Sierra Club, and a plethora of mass-member activist groups. But he said that these groups did not tend to foster face-to-face interaction, and were the type where &quot;the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally reading a newsletter.&quot; He also drew a distinction between two different types of social capital: a &quot;bonding&quot; type (which occurs within a demographic group) and a &quot;bridging&quot; type (which unites people from different groups).

He then asked: &quot;Why is US social capital eroding?&quot; and discussed several possible causes. He believed that the &quot;movement of women into the workforce&quot; and other demographic changes had an impact on the number of individuals engaging in civic associations. He also discussed the &quot;re-potting hypothesis&quot;, that people become less engaged when they frequently move towns, but found that Americans actually moved towns less frequently than in previous decades. He did suggest that suburbanization, economics and time pressures had some effect, though he noted that average working hours had shortened. He concluded the main cause was technology &quot;individualizing&quot; people&#x27;s leisure time via television and the Internet, suspecting that &quot;virtual reality helmets&quot; would carry this further in the future.

He estimated that the fall-off in civic engagement after 1965 was 10 percent due to pressure of work and double-career families, 10 percent to suburbanization, commuting, and urban sprawl, 25 percent to the expansion of electronic entertainment (especially television), and 50 percent to generational change (although he estimated that the effects of television and generational change overlapped by 10 to 15 percent). 15 to 20 percent remained unexplained.

Putnam suggested closer studies of which forms of associations could create the greatest social capital, and how various aspects of technology, changes in social equality, and public policy affect social capital. He closed by emphasizing the importance of discovering how the United States could reverse the trend of social capital decay.

==Reception==
A review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised the book for being understandable for non-academic readers, and said that overall it was an &quot;exhaustive and carefully argued study.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; called it &quot;a prodigious achievement.&quot; C. S. Fischer, a sociology professor from the University of California, gave a positive review. Although he criticized a few of Putnam&#x27;s interpretations of the data and felt that &quot;social capital&quot; was an awkward metaphor, he nevertheless called it &quot;a 10-pin strike, a major contribution to study of social networks and social cohesion&quot; with particular praise for its wide use of data.

Everett Carll Ladd claimed that Putnam completely ignored existing field studies, most notably the landmark sociological Middletown studies, which during the 1920s raised the same concerns he does today, except the technology being attacked as promoting isolation was radio instead of television and video games.

Other critics questioned Putnam&#x27;s major finding—that civic participation has been declining. Journalist Nicholas Lemann proposed that rather than declining, civic activity in the US had assumed different forms. While bowling leagues and many other organizations had declined, others like youth soccer leagues had grown. He also points out that the thesis of &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; contradicts an implicit assumption of Putnam&#x27;s previous book &quot;Making Democracy Work&quot; – that a tradition of civic engagement is incredibly durable over time.

In their 2017 book &quot;One Nation After Trump&quot;, Thomas E. Mann, Norm Ornstein and E. J. Dionne wrote that the decline of social and civic groups that Putnam documented was a factor in the election of Donald Trump as &quot;many rallied to him out of a yearning for forms of community and solidarity that they sense have been lost.&quot;

<doc id="722251" wikidata="Q6609506" url="?curid=722251" title="William C. Rogers III">
<text>William Chapel Rogers III (born December 13, 1938) is a former officer in the United States Navy, most notable as the captain of , a Aegis cruiser. While under his command, the ship shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in the Persian Gulf, killing 290 civilians and creating an international incident.

==Early life and career prior to 1988==
Rogers was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and grew up in San Antonio, Texas. His father, William C. Rogers II, was a United States Navy psychologist during World War II. He has a younger brother named Dick, who was paralyzed in an automobile accident, leaving him in a wheelchair. Rogers majored in psychology at Baylor University and earned a master&#x27;s degree in history from Trinity University in San Antonio. He taught high school science for two years before entering Officer Candidate School.

Rogers was commissioned December 1965 and his first tour of duty was in the engineering department aboard the aircraft carrier, . His next duty station was , a , stationed at Long Beach then later at Yokosuka, Japan. In December 1969, Rogers reported to , a to be the commissioning operations officer homeported in Charleston, South Carolina. Rogers first command was , an also homeported in Charleston. After attending Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia Rogers worked with three admirals in Washington, D.C., and was assigned to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group under the Secretary of Defense. This duty involved a series of trips to Israel in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In 1978, Rogers reported to a to be the commissioning executive officer, second in command. He would later command , another &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer, from September 1981 to August 1984. Prior to his command of he served in the Pentagon as the head of a section in the Planning Division of Chief of Naval Operations.

Captain Rogers married Sharon (Loomis) Rogers, in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 12, 1964. They had one son born February 1969 named Will C. Rogers IV who is known as Bill.

==Commanding USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;==
Rogers was the second commanding officer of &quot;Vincennes&quot; and assumed command April 11, 1987. At the time, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was one of only five cruisers commissioned that carried the new Aegis combat system, a billion-dollar computerized integrated battle management system and the first such cruiser to join the Pacific fleet. The heart of Aegis is an advanced, automatic detect-and-track, multi-function three-dimensional phased array radar, the AN/SPY-1. Known as &quot;the Shield of the Fleet&quot;, the high-powered radar is able to perform search, tracking, and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a track capacity of over 100 targets at more than . Command of an Aegis cruiser was considered to be very prestigious at the time. On April 25, 1988, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was deployed on a six-month cruise in support of Operation Earnest Will, the reflagging and escort of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.

==Iran Air 655==
On July 3, 1988, &quot;Vincennes&quot; shot down Iran Air Flight 655 with two radar guided SM-2MR missiles. Iran Air Flight 655, carrying 290 occupants, had been airborne for seven minutes when the missiles hit approximately from &quot;Vincennes&quot;. The airliner crashed into the Persian Gulf east of Hengham Island (). All 290 onboard including 16 crew perished. At the time of the incident, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was inside Iranian territorial waters and engaged in small arms combat with several Iranian surface craft, and &quot;Vincennes&quot; received a report that one of its LAMPS III Seahawk helicopters had drawn warning fire during flight operations.

A subsequent US report by Rear Admiral William Fogarty, titled &quot;Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on July 3, 1988&quot;, noted that Captain Rogers received some faulty information that he subsequently used to make the decision to fire on the plane. Specifically, he was told the aircraft was identified as an Iranian Air Force F-14 Tomcat descending in an attack profile, and that it was identifying itself with secondary surveillance radar / IFF mode-II codes exclusively used by military aircraft. The investigation noted that Rogers was focused on the ongoing surface engagement and was aware of the inbound aircraft for less than four minutes. The investigation also pointed out that Rogers thought that he had an increased burden to act since he was also assigned to protect the frigate . The investigation concluded that Rogers acted in a prudent manner based on the information available to him, and the short time frame involved. He was also judged to have acted within the prescribed rules of engagement for USN warship captains in that situation.

Independent investigations into the incident have presented a different picture. John Barry and Roger Charles of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine claimed that Rogers was overeager for combat, that he started the fight with Iranian gunboats, and then followed them into Iranian territorial waters. Barry and Charles also accused the U.S. government of a cover-up.

Other sources lay some of the blame on the complexity of the AEGIS technology and the desire on the part of Captain Rogers to make use of it. An analysis of the events by the International Strategic Studies Association described the deployment of an Aegis cruiser into that zone as irresponsible, and the Association thought that the enormous cost of his warship had played a major part in setting a low threshold for Captain Rogers decision to open fire.

In 2004, Marita Turpin and Niek du Plooy of the Centre for Logistics and Decision Support partially attributed the accident to an expectancy bias introduced by the Aegis Combat System and faulted the design and &quot;unhelpful user interface&quot; as contributing to the errors of judgment.

Rogers was personally criticized for being overly aggressive by Commander David Carlson, commanding officer of , a second ship that was under the tactical control of Rogers at the time of the incident. Carlson described the downing of the airliner as the &quot;horrifying climax to Capt. Rogers&#x27; aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago&quot;. He was referring to incidents on June 2, 1988, when he claimed that Rogers brought &quot;Vincennes&quot; too close to an Iranian frigate that was searching a bulk carrier, that he launched a helicopter too close to Iranian small boats, and that he fired upon a number of small Iranian military boats instead of directing another, smaller warship to do so. In disagreeing with Rogers&#x27; decision – citing the high cost of the cruiser relative to that of the frigates attached to the group – Carlson posited, &quot;Why do you want an AEGIS cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn&#x27;t a smart thing to do.&quot;

USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;, with Rogers remaining in command, completed the remainder of her scheduled deployment to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. During the voyage home on September 22, 1988, &quot;Vincennes&quot; rescued 26 Vietnamese boat people adrift in the South China Sea. The ship returned to Naval Station San Diego on October 25, 1988.

Rogers remained in command of USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; until May 27, 1989. In 1990, Captain Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit decoration &quot;for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer ... from April 1987 to May 1989.&quot; The award was given for his service as the Commanding Officer of &quot;Vincennes&quot;, and the citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655.

==Bombing of Rogers&#x27; family minivan==
Nine months after the downing of Iran Air Flight 655, on the morning of March 10, 1989, Rogers&#x27; wife Sharon escaped uninjured when a pipe bomb exploded and set fire to her minivan as she sat stopped at a red light across the street from the University Towne Center shopping mall in San Diego. The van was registered in the name of Will Rogers III, and many people at the time of the bombing suspected that terrorism was involved. Five months later, the Associated Press reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had shifted focus away from terrorism towards the possibility of someone with a personal vendetta against Captain Rogers. As of 2003, the bombing of Rogers&#x27; van remained an unsolved case, despite a major investigation involving at some time up to 300 police and FBI agents.

==Naval career following &quot;Vincennes&quot;==
Rogers&#x27; next assignment was as commanding officer of the United States Navy Tactical Training Group at Naval Base Point Loma, a group responsible for training officers in handling combat situations. After being passed over for promotion to flag rank, he retired from the United States Navy in August 1991. In 1992, Rogers and his wife Sharon co-wrote a book, &quot;Storm Center: A Personal Account of Tragedy &amp; Terrorism&quot;, which describes the events surrounding the downing of Iran Air 655 and the minivan bombing from their personal perspectives.

<text>The Tbilisi Metro () is a rapid transit system in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. Opened on 11 January 1966, it was the fourth metro system in the former Soviet Union. Like other ex-Soviet metros, most of the stations are very deep and vividly decorated.

At present, the system consists of two lines, in total length, serving 23 stations. In 2017, the Metro transported 113.827 million passengers. The Metro is operated by the Tbilisi Transport Company, which began operation the same year as the Tbilisi Metro, in 1966.

==History==

=== Initial construction ===
Tbilisi (officially known as Tiflis until 1936), the capital of Georgia, was considered historically to be one of the most important cities of the Soviet Union, particularly because of its political position as being the most significant city in the Caucasus and the capital of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, which lasted until 1936. The city grew rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries, and apart from being a cultural and political centre, it was also an important transport hub in Transcaucasia and an industrial centre as well. 
Features of the historically established development of Tbilisi, stretching for more than along the Mtkvari river, densely built-up city centre, and narrow steep streets in some parts of the city, impede the development of land transport. All this contributed to the need for a rapid transit Metro system. Especially considering its geographic characteristic - Tbilisi is considerably long, which undoubtedly would simplify the coverage of most parts of the city by the underground.

Construction began in 1952. Tbilisi was one of the few cities in the former USSR where work on the Metro system started before the population reached one million people. A population of over a million people was one of the main requirements for Soviet cities to build a metro system.

On 11 January 1966, the Tbilisi Metro was opened: it was the first and only Metro system in Georgia and the fourth one in the former Soviet Union (after Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kyiv) when the first six stations were opened. Since then, the system has steadily grown into a two-line, 23-station network.

=== Further development ===
During the 1990s, most of the Soviet-era station names were changed, although financial difficulties after the breakup of the Soviet Union hit the Metro particularly hard in its infrastructure, operations, and extensions. In the early mid-1990s, the Tbilisi metro was usually not working due to the lack of electricity. Until recently, the Metro had been underfunded and operated in severe difficulties due to poor electrical supply. It had also become infamous for widespread petty crime, like pickpocketing and mugging. In addition, there have been several incidents at metro stations in recent years. 
On 9 October 1997, a former policeman blew himself up at Didube station. On 14 February 2000, a teenager threw a homemade hand grenade into a metro station, injuring several people. In March 2004, several people were poisoned by an unidentified gas while using the Metro. However, crime has reduced as a result of security and administration reforms in the system from 2004 to 2005. Other services have also significantly improved.

==Modernization efforts==
The Tbilisi Metro system is undergoing a major rehabilitation effort, including the reconstruction of the stations as well as the modernization of trains and other facilities. The city&#x27;s 2006 budget allocated 16 million lari for this project. Former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili promised to make the Metro a most prestigious public transport system, and charged the Director General of Tbilisi Metro, Zurab Kikalishvili, in late 2005, to bring the metro up to European standards by 2007. In 2005 began the renovation process of subway trains. As part of the modernization, the soviet-era rolling stock was overhauled, old parts were replaced with new ones, the interior of the car was changed, and the exterior was given a different look. Additionally, the driver cab was equipped with a modern control panel.

In subsequent years, however, the upgrade process slowed significantly, and as of July 2010, the Tbilisi Metro was still far from its target standard. Some renovated metro stations had to be repaired again soon due to deficient planning and poor quality of the renovation. The renovation process of the system continues unfortunately slowly and there are several stations under renovation. Tbilisi City Hall purchased 10 4-car trains for Tbilisi Metro from Metrowagonmash, which will meet European standards.

The extension of the Saburtalo Line to State University station began in 1985. In 1993, the construction was stopped and it went into conservation mode. In January 2012 construction was scheduled to start on a frozen extension of the Saburtalo Line from the Vazha-Pshavela station to the Sakhelmtsipo Universiteti (State University) station, of which 80% of the work was completed during the Soviet era. But it was only restarted in July 2015 with financial help from the Asian Development Bank and the station was finally opened to the public on 16 October 2017. The new State University station meets modern standards and is equipped with new technologies. Additionally, the Delisi-Vazha-Pshavela tunnel was also opened.

In February 2021, Gotsiridze station was renovated, and was scheduled to be completed within 3 months. Trains did not stop while construction works were in progress, passing through the station. However, reconstruction works were only completed in March 2023, with facilities dedicated to the disabled such as new elevators and tactile paths.

=== Noise issues ===
The noise problem on the Tbilisi Metro can be attributed to various factors. The most significant cause is the aging infrastructure, as many sections of the metro system were constructed decades ago and have not undergone significant renovations or soundproofing measures. The trains themselves, the 81-717/14&#x27;s and Ezh3&#x27;s, produce high noise levels in relativity to modern rolling stock due to their outdated design and lack of noise reduction features. Additionally, the higher-speed operation of the trains with the rolling stock&#x27;s non-asynchronous motors, combined with the confined space of the underground tunnels, amplifies the noise and creates a discomforting environment for passengers. The amplification is further increased by the interior shell of the tunnels, which are covered in concrete.

The impact of excessive noise on the Tbilisi Metro has been a matter of concern for both commuters and metro authorities. Prolonged exposure to loud noise can lead to various health issues, including hearing loss, stress, and sleep disturbances. Furthermore, the noise problem creates an unpleasant travel experience and reduces the overall quality of the metro system. To tackle the noise issue directly at its source, the Mayor&#x27;s Office has invested in the procurement of new trains with advanced noise reduction technology. These modern trains are designed to minimize noise emissions and provide a quieter and more comfortable journey for passengers. The Metro easily reaches over 90db, which is a dangerous level for human health. Despite noise being a very frequent complaint from many commuters, leadership has not yet released any statement regarding a plan to combat the issue.

In 2019, the complete rehabilitation of power lines and ventilation systems in the metro began. With the replacement of the power cable, 32 new fans will be installed. The Asian Development Bank has allocated $15 million for this project.

==Rolling stock upgrades==

The government of Tbilisi, through partial funding from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, spent more than 48 million Euros on purchasing 44, new, modern metro cars or 10 train sets in February 2023 from Metrowagonmash, bringing the system&#x27;s outdated rolling stock up to date. Moreover, the depot and the connecting tunnel will be rehabilitated as a part of the project to support the new trains. This is the first major rolling stock update for the network since it began operation more than 50 years ago.

In May 2023, the contract with Metrowagonmash was cancelled after the company was internationally sanctioned. Tbilisi has not lost interest in purchasing new rolling stock, and government officials are meeting with major rolling stock company representatives to start a new tender process.

===Timeline===

==Operation==

, the system consists of two lines, serving 23 stations, operating on of the route and of track. Of the 23 stations, 21 stations are below ground and two are surface level. Of the subterranean stations, 17 are deep level and 4 are shallows. The former comprises 6 pylon stations, 5 columns and 6 single vaults (built to the Leningrad Technology). The shallow stations consist of three pillar trepans and one single vault (Kharkiv Technology). Due to Tbilisi&#x27;s uneven landscape, the Metro, particularly the Akhmeteli-Varketili line, has one surface-level section.

An estimated total of 105.6 million people used the Metro annually as of 2005, though the actual figure by 2012 was closer to 94 million. Carrying them are a fleet of 170 Soviet-built rail cars, consisting of the 81–717/714 and Еzh3 models, which have been modernised since 2000 (using the Czech blueprint of the 81-71M) and operate from two depots. Station platforms are approximately 102 meters in length, and built to accommodate five-carriage trains, though four-car trains operate on both lines of the subway system.

Trains run from a little before 6:00 am (exact times vary depending on the station) until midnight, with intervals ranging between minutes at peak times and 12 minutes later in the night. Train speeds are , while the average trip speed is slightly over .

As of 2018, due to the State University (Tbilisi Metro) extension, a new digital signaling system was installed by Siemens, controlling of track and three interlockings, from Delisi to State University (Tbilisi Metro), which is the only segment in the network containing signaling systems from the post-Soviet era.

==Fares==
The Tbilisi Metro uses a flat-fare system of 1 lari per journey. Tokens are no longer used, and riders must purchase for 2 lari a Metromoney Card (a stored value card available at metro stations), onto which they can add fares. The card allows riders to re-enter the system within 90 minutes of leaving it at no charge.

==Future==

The system also had an advanced extension plan, with a third line, amongst other locations, encompassing the district of Vake. Forming a typical Soviet triangle with a three-line six radii layout intersecting in the city centre. However, most of the construction sites remain frozen, some dating to Soviet times.

There were also in the past plans to return to a tram network in Tbilisi. However, today this is no longer discussed by any political party.

In October 2018, then-Prime Minister of Georgia, Mamuka Bakhtadze announced during the Georgian Dream conference that 7 new stations will form a new line connecting central Tbilisi with the southeastern outskirts of the city and Tbilisi Shota Rustaveli Airport. According to the plan, the new overground line will run from Samgori metro station to the Lilo market in the east of the city, and was planned to be opened in 2020. As of present day, the project has not been started. The new metro line was planned to use Light Rail Vehicles running at 10 minute intervals for both directions. The mayor Kakha Kaladze added, that the line is planned to be extended to Rustavi, a major city away from the capital. Although, this remains a plan until the overground line is open. Today, this plan is no longer ever brought up by the ruling party.

==Metro reform plan==
In October 2022, EBRD worked with the Tbilisi Mayor&#x27;s Office to start and fund a project to renovate the above ground infrastructure of 11 Metro stations, adapting them to be wheelchair accessible.
Along with this plan, 4 Metro stations are to have new entrances constructed. Over 50 million euros were approved for this project.
A tender for the project was announced in July 2023. The winning tender, approved by city hall officials, will commence works in multiple different areas, from internal station infrastructure such as electricity systems and fire-repellant system, to improvements in the passenger experience, in the form of accessibility. 3 escalators at Station Square (Tbilisi Metro) will be completely replaced, along with 36 other escalators that will be modernized to save energy. Along with all the other plans in the metro reform project, the expected date of completion is 2029.

<text>The Cleveland Museum of Natural History is a natural history museum in University Circle, a district of educational, cultural and medical institutions approximately five miles (8 km) east of Downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The museum was established in 1920 by Cyrus S. Eaton to perform research, education and development of collections in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, astronomy, botany, geology, paleontology, wildlife biology, and zoology. The museum traces its roots to the Ark, formed in 1836 on Cleveland&#x27;s Public Square by William Case, the Academy of Natural Science formed by William Case and Jared Potter Kirtland, and the Kirtland Society of Natural History, founded in 1869 and reinvigorated in 1922 by the trustees of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

Donald Johanson was the curator of the museum when he discovered &quot;Lucy,&quot; the skeletal remains of the ancient hominid &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;. The current Curator and Head of the Physical Anthropology Department is Yohannes Haile-Selassie.

The museum has embarked on a multi-year, $150 million renovation and expansion project. DLR Group was selected to design the project in June 2019, and the museum broke ground on its new visitor hall, lobby and exhibit wing in June 2021. The renovation was completed in December 2024.

== History ==
The Cleveland Museum of Natural History traces its founding, in part, back to the 1830s. A two-room frame house located on the northeast side of Public Square, known as the Ark, housed taxidermy ranging from birds to reptiles and mammals. This was the collection of Leonard Case Sr., who passed the collection and building to his sons Leonard Case Jr. and William Case. The Ark was frequented by a group of 26 men known as Arkites. These men collected, researched, and discussed findings with each other. There were no museums in Cleveland at the time.

In 1876 the Ark moved to nearby Case Hall. The original structure was torn down to build a post office. The collection remained there until 1916, when the facility was converted to the Cleveland Public Library.

The Cleveland Museum of Natural History, as it is known today, was founded in 1920. It was located in an office of the Lennox Building. At the end of the following year, the museum moved to a mansion on Euclid Avenue, a part of Cleveland&#x27;s millionaires&#x27; row. This location was first opened to the public June 24, 1922.

The museum received the precious stone collection of Jeptha Wade II, after his death in 1926. In 1930, the museum organized an ornithological safari to Kenya, expanding the Case collection. The Haplocanthosaurus dinosaur, discovered by museum crew in 1954, is one of the most complete examples ever found of this 70-footlong sauropod. Beyond their walls, the museum participated in the operation of the Cleveland Zoo from 1940 and 1975; it also served as a leading force behind the creation of the Cleveland Aquarium, which it administered until 1985. In 1995 the museum maintained 12 natural areas in surrounding counties as sanctuaries.

In 1958, the museum moved to its current location in University Circle at Wade Park. The new, two-level building housed exhibits and educational activities, while the collections were stored off-site. Additions quickly followed, including an observatory, planetarium and the Kirtland Hall of Nature.

The Ralph Mueller Observatory opened in December 1960. It houses a 10½-inch refracting telescope built by the Warner &amp; Swasey Co. of Cleveland in 1899. J.A. Brashear Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a division of American Optical Company, ground the optics. Warner &amp; Swasey Co. originally donated the telescope to Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University). It was located on the roof of the university&#x27;s physics building for 61 years before being acquired by the museum.

An 85,000 square feet addition in 1972 enlarged the museum, adding galleries, the Murch Auditorium, the Harold T. Clark Library and Rare Book Room, classrooms, a paleontology laboratory, and the front entrance and lobby. This created a circular building with a courtyard in the middle.

In 1973, curator Donald Johanson joined an archeological expedition in Ethiopia, where he discovered &quot;Lucy,&quot; deemed one of the most important fossil finds in human evolutionary studies. This Australopithecus afarensis demonstrated modern upright walking in a 3.2 million-year-old female hominin.

A new 62,000-square-foot wing on the back of the museum was completed in 1989. It added a large exhibit hall for traveling exhibits, as well as an expanded gift shop and three floors for collections and administrative offices.

In January 2002, Shafran Planetarium opened to the public. Designed by Cleveland architectural and engineering firm Westlake Reed Leskosky (now DLR Group), the building exterior functions as an astronomical instrument. Nightly, visitors can use the building&#x27;s angled roof to locate Polaris. The building&#x27;s titanium-coated, stainless-steel outer covering sparkles with stars created by embedded fiber-optic lighting. This system emits a subtle glow without contributing to the light pollution above University Circle.

DLR Group was selected to design a renovation of the museum in June 2019. On June 24, 2021, a groundbreaking ceremony took place for an expansion as part of the museum&#x27;s Centennial Transformation Project. The design is said to evoke the melting ice that made the Great Lakes region and the impact of water on the communities. The project was originally expected to be completed in 2026 and is proposed to cost $150 million. The renovation includes two halls—Dynamic Earth, covering , and Evolving Life, covering —as well as a new facade. A new entrance and other upgrades opened in December 2022, and a new visitor hall opened at the museum in October 2023. Dynamic Earth, Evolving Life, and several other renovated exhibition halls opened on December 13–15, 2024, two years ahead of the original schedule. The project expanded the museum&#x27;s total space to .

==Collections==
Museum collections total more than four million specimens and include specimens of paleontology, zoology, archaeology, mineralogy, ornithology, and a variety of other scientific subjects.

, these items are off display:
*An extensive collection of Late Devonian fossil fish from the Cleveland Shale, including several mounted skulls of the arthrodire placoderm Dunkleosteus.
*Nine hundred monkey and ape skeletons, and more than 3,100 human skeletons (the Hamann-Todd Collection).
*A controversial skull of a juvenile tyrannosaur that was the basis for the species &quot;Nanotyrannus lancensis&quot;. This skull was discovered by a field crew led by former CMNH curator David Dunkle.
*The holotype of the &quot;Haplocanthosaurus&quot; sauropod, nicknamed &quot;Happy&quot;.
*The most complete mount of a &quot;Coelophysis bauri,&quot; a composite skeleton composed of multiple adult skeletons from the famous quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico.
*Mounted taxidermy remains of Balto the sled dog.
*An extensive mineralogy collection that includes a Moon rock and the Jeptha Wade gem collection.
*Replica skeletons of &quot;Triceratops,&quot; an adult &quot;Tyrannosaurus,&quot; and Jane, a juvenile tyrannosaurid formerly designated as the controversial species &quot;Nanotyrannus lancensis&quot;.
*Multiple mastodon and mammoth specimens.
*A cast and a lifelike recreation of an &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; skeleton, an early hominid affectionately dubbed Lucy.
*A partial &quot;Allosaurus&quot; skeleton.
*A collection of 30,000 plant fossils acquired from the University of Cincinnati by former curator of paleobotany, Shya Chitaley.
* A Foucault pendulum underneath in which the Bicentennial Education Time Capsule was buried in 1996 and will be opened in 2046.

The museum has made many discoveries over the years. A new ceratopsian, &quot;Albertaceratops nesmoi&quot;, was named in 2007 by former CMNH curator of Vertebrate Paleontology Michael Ryan.

===Hamann-Todd Collection===
The Hamann-Todd Collection is a collection of more than 3100 human skeletons and over 900 primate skeletons that were assembled starting in 1893. The collection was originally housed at Western Reserve University Medical School in a new medical building that was built for that purpose. The first floor of this building contained the Hamann Museum of Comparative Anthropology and Anatomy. However, due to the costs of storing the bones, the collection was transferred to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

In 1893, Carl August Hamann initiated the collection. Its administration was taken over by T. Wingate Todd after Hamann was named dean of Western Reserve University&#x27;s medical school in 1912. Todd managed to assemble the great majority of the human skeletons in the collection, over 3000, before his death in 1938.

===Perkins Wildlife Center===
The Ralph Perkins II Wildlife Center and Woods Garden presented by KeyBank, which includes live animals and plants native to Ohio, opened on September 3, 2016.

===Artwork===

The museum&#x27;s collection of art includes:
*&quot;Steggie&quot;, an -long, -tall Stegosaurus sculpture, has greeted museum visitors since 1968. When the original sculpture became worn, a new cast (&quot;Steggie II&quot;) was made from the original mold by Louis Paul Jonas Studios, the artists who created the first sculpture. In 2016, it was repainted in colors better reflecting current scientific understanding.
*Victor Schreckengost&#x27;s &quot;Pachyderms&quot; reliefs are mounted on a wall outside the museum facing the intersection of East Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The 32-ton terra cotta reliefs depict adult and juvenile mastodons and mammoths, and were originally created in 1955 for the pachyderm house at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. When the pachyderm house was demolished for a replacement exhibit in 2008, they were removed and placed in storage. The Intermuseum Conservation Association oversaw their reinstallation at the museum in 2016.
*&quot;Old Grizzly&quot;, a four-ton limestone bear, was sculpted by William McVey in 1934 through the federal Public Works of Art Project. When the Cleveland Zoo was located in Wade Park, the sculpture was placed near the bear enclosure. It currently sits in the Perkins Wildlife Center.

<doc id="722312" wikidata="Q2443714" url="?curid=722312" title="Women in Love">
<text>Women in Love is a 1920 novel by English author D. H. Lawrence. It is a sequel to his earlier novel, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915), and follows the continuing loves and lives of the Brangwen sisters, Gudrun and Ursula. Gudrun Brangwen, an artist, pursues a destructive relationship with Gerald Crich, an industrialist. Lawrence contrasts this pair with the love that develops between Ursula Brangwen and Rupert Birkin, an alienated intellectual who articulates many opinions associated with the author. The emotional relationships thus established are given further depth and tension by an intense psychological and physical attraction between Gerald and Rupert.

The novel ranges over the whole of British society before the time of the First World War and eventually concludes in the snows of the Tyrolean Alps. Ursula&#x27;s character draws on Lawrence&#x27;s wife Frieda and Gudrun&#x27;s on Katherine Mansfield, while Rupert Birkin&#x27;s has elements of Lawrence himself, and Gerald Crich is partly based on Mansfield&#x27;s husband, John Middleton Murry.

== Synopsis ==
Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen are sisters living in The Midlands in England in the 1910s. Ursula is a schoolteacher, Gudrun a painter. They meet two men who live nearby, school inspector Rupert Birkin and Gerald Crich, heir to a coal mine, and the four become friends. Romantic relationships quickly develop as the novel progresses.

All four are deeply concerned with questions of society, politics, and the relationship between men and women. At a party at Shortlands, the Crich family&#x27;s country manor home, Gerald&#x27;s sister Diana drowns. Gudrun becomes the teacher and mentor of Gerald&#x27;s youngest sister. Soon, Gerald&#x27;s coal-mine-owning father dies as well, after a long illness. After the funeral, Gerald goes to Gudrun&#x27;s house and spends the night with her while her parents sleep in another room.

Birkin asks Ursula to marry him, and she agrees. Gerald and Gudrun&#x27;s relationship, however, becomes stormy.

The two couples take a holiday together in the Austrian Alps. Gudrun begins an intense friendship with Loerke, a physically puny but emotionally commanding artist from Dresden. Gerald, enraged by Loerke and most of all by Gudrun&#x27;s verbal abuse and rejection of his manhood, and driven by his own internal violence, tries to strangle Gudrun. He suddenly becomes disgusted with his actions and lets her go. He leaves Gudrun and Loerke to climb the mountain, eventually slipping into a snowy valley where he falls asleep and freezes to death.

The impact of Gerald&#x27;s death upon Birkin is profound. The novel ends a few weeks after Gerald&#x27;s death with Birkin trying to explain to Ursula that, although he needed no other woman than Ursula, he valued a relationship with Gerald that is gone forever.

== Publication history ==
After years of misunderstandings, accusations of duplicity, and hurried letters, Thomas Seltzer finally published the first edition of &quot;Women in Love&quot; in New York City, on 9 November 1920. This had come after three drawn out years of delays and revisions. This first limited edition (1,250 books) was available only to subscribers, due to the controversy caused by Lawrence&#x27;s previous work, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915).

Originally, the two books were written as parts of a single novel, but the publisher had decided to publish them separately and in rapid succession. The first book&#x27;s treatment of sexuality was frank for the mores of the time, and, after an obscenity trial, the book was banned in the UK for 11 years, although it was available in the US. The publisher then backed out of publishing the second book in the UK, so &quot;Women in Love&quot; first appeared in the US. Martin Secker published the first trade edition of &quot;Women in Love&quot; in London, on 10 June 1921.

== Reception ==
As with most of Lawrence&#x27;s works, &quot;Women in Love&quot;″s sexual subject matter caused controversy. For example, W. Charles Pilley, an early reviewer wrote of it in &quot;John Bull&quot;, &quot;I do not claim to be a literary critic, but I know dirt when I smell it, and here is dirt in heaps—festering, putrid heaps which smell to high Heaven.&quot; Lawrence was sued for libel by Lady Ottoline Morrell and others, who claimed their likenesses were unjustly drawn upon in &quot;The Rainbow&quot;. The book also later stirred criticism for its portrayal of love, and denounced as chauvinistic and centred upon the phallus by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949).

In contrast, the critic Camille Paglia has praised &quot;Women in Love&quot;, writing in &quot;Vamps and Tramps&quot; (1994) that while she initially reacted negatively to the book, it became a &quot;profound influence&quot; on her as she was working on &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990). Paglia compared Lawrence&#x27;s novel to the poet Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590). Paglia observed that while &quot;Women in Love&quot; has &quot;bisexual implications&quot;, she is skeptical that Lawrence would have endorsed &quot;full sexual relations&quot; between men. The critic Harold Bloom listed &quot;Women in Love&quot; in his &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994) among the books that have been important and influential in Western culture. Francis Spalding suggested that Lawrence&#x27;s fascination with the theme of homosexuality is manifested in &quot;Women in Love&quot;, and that this could be related to his own sexual orientation. In 1999, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Women in Love&quot; forty-ninth on a list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film adaptation ===
Screenwriter and producer Larry Kramer and director Ken Russell adapted the novel into the film, &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969), for which Glenda Jackson won the Academy Award for Best Actress. It was one of the first American theatrical films to show male genitals, in scenes when Gerald Crich (Oliver Reed) and Rupert Birkin (Alan Bates) wrestle in the nude in front of a roaring fireplace, in several early skinny dipping shots, and in an explicit sequence of Birkin running naked in the forest after being hit on the head by his spurned former mistress, Hermione Roddice (Eleanor Bron).

=== Radio and television adaptations ===
William Ivory combined &quot;Women in Love&quot; with Lawrence&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915), in his two-part BBC Four television adaptation titled, &quot;Women in Love&quot; (first transmitted 24 and 31 March 2011), directed by Miranda Bowen. The cast is headed by Saskia Reeves as the mother, Anna Brangwen, with Rachael Stirling and Rosamund Pike as her daughters, Ursula and Gudrun. Other cast members include Rory Kinnear as Rupert Birkin, Joseph Mawle as Gerald Crich, and Ben Daniels as Will Brangwen. In this adaptation, Ivory sets the final scenes and Gerald&#x27;s death not in the Tyrolean Alps, but in South African diamond mines and desert sands, where Gerald walks out in the dunes and meets his demise.

BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Women in Love&quot; as a four-part serial in 1996, dramatised by Elaine Feinstein and starring Stella Gonet as Gudrun, Clare Holman as Ursula, Douglas Hodge as Gerald and Nicholas Farrell as Rupert. It has been repeated several times on BBC Radio 4 Extra, most recently in July 2022.

Alongside her legislative work, she has also represented the Philippines to UNESCO multiple times. In 2018, Legarda became a Commissioner of the newly formed international organization, Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). She also chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which encompasses 20 climate vulnerable countries.

For her environmental work, Legarda has received numerous accolades; she was awarded 2001 UNEP Laureate as declared by the United Nations Environment Programme, a 2008 Regional Champion for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation for Asia and the Pacific as declared by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, a &quot;National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Champion&quot; by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2017.

She was honored as a &quot;Chevalier&quot; in France and &quot;Cavaliere&quot; in Italy.

==Early life==
Loren Legarda was born on January 28, 1960, in Malabon (then a municipality in Rizal) as Lorna Regina Bautista Legarda, the only daughter of Antonio Cabrera Legarda and Maria Salome Basilia &quot;Bessie&quot; Gella Bautista. Her maternal grandfather was Jose P. Bautista, editor-in-chief of the pre-Martial Law newspaper, &quot;The Manila Times,&quot; while her maternal grandmother was Carmen Gella de Bautista of Pandan, Antique. Legarda&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Ariston Rendon Gella, was a member of the Malolos Congress that crafted the Philippine Constitution of the First Philippine Republic. Her great-great-uncle Vicente Gella was governor of the province while her great-granduncle was mayor of Sibalom. A brother of her grandfather, Bartolomé Gella, also served as governor of Antique.

As a teenager, she appeared as a print and television model. She attended Assumption College from primary to high school, where she was a grade school valedictorian. She graduated cum laude from the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1981 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in broadcast communications and was President of the UP Broadcast Association. She pursued post-graduate courses on special studies towards professional designation in journalism from the University of California, Los Angeles.

==Career in journalism==
Legarda began a career in journalism as a reporter for RPN, during which she covered topics including Imelda Marcos&#x27; trip to Kenya and the People Power Revolution. During this period, she obtained a master&#x27;s degree in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines, graduating at the top of the class with gold medals for Academic Excellence and Best Thesis. Later, she would move to the reopened ABS-CBN. She became the co-anchor of the television newscast, &quot;The World Tonight&quot; with Angelo Castro, Jr., and became the host of the current affairs series, &quot;The Inside Story&quot;.

As a journalist, Loren earned the Gawad Cultural Center of the Philippines, Catholic Mass Media Hall of Fame, Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas Golden Dove Award, Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) from the Philippine Jaycees (1992), The Outstanding Women in the Nation&#x27;s Service (TOWNS) Award (1995), and the Benigno Aquino Award for Journalism (1995), among more than 30 awards.

==Political career==

===1998 Senate bid, first term===
Legarda ran for the Senate in 1998 under the Lakas-NUCD-UMDP Party. She was elected with more than 15 million votes, rendering her the highest number of votes in that year&#x27;s election and becoming the second woman to top a Philippine senatorial election. Upon Legarda filing her candidacy as senator in late 1997, Tina Monzon-Palma who came from rival ABC (now TV5) and was the anchor of The Big News, transferred to ABS-CBN in order to replace her on The World Tonight at the same time and joining Angelo Castro, Jr. in order to run the latter for this election. In 1999, the newscast was replaced by Pulso: Aksyon Balita on ABS-CBN and was moved to the ABS-CBN News Channel, where it has aired since.

During her first six years in the Senate, Legarda authored legislation benefiting women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights, such as the Anti-Domestic Violence Act which seeks to uphold and protect the basic human rights of women and their children, the Anti-Child Labor law which limits the employment of children below 15 years old, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act which aims to protect victims of human trafficking, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Law which created the National Solid Waste Management Commission, and the Tropical Fabric Law. She also authored the Eid&#x27;ul Fitr Holiday Law, Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003, and the Philippine Ear Research Institute Act.

Legarda was named as one of the &quot;Global Leaders for Tomorrow&quot; by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in 2000, and was awarded by the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) in Turin, Italy, for her work on the environment in 2001. Legarda played a role in the 2000–01 impeachment trial of Joseph Estrada that sparked the Second EDSA Revolution, voting to examine the envelope containing evidence of alleged corruption of the Estrada administration. She was later chosen to be the Senate&#x27;s Majority Floor Leader from 2001 to 2004, becoming the first woman to hold the position.

===2004 vice presidential bid===
In 2003, Legarda left Lakas–CMD (after Gloria Macapagal Arroyo broke her pledge not to run again for president) and joined the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino coalition of Fernando Poe, Jr. as an Independent during the 2004 elections. She lost the election to Noli de Castro, the running mate of Arroyo, under a narrow margin of 3.9%.

On January 18, 2008, in a 21-page resolution, penned by Senior Justice Leonardo Quisumbing, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), dismissed Legarda&#x27;s electoral protest against de Castro.

===2007 Senate bid, second term===
In 2007, Legarda decided to run again for Senate under the banner of the Genuine Opposition coalition. She won, receiving more than 18 million votes, which allowed her to become the top vote-getter in that election. In her second term as senator, Legarda authored the Expanded Senior Citizens Law, the Climate Change Act, Clean Air Act, Renewable Energy Act, the Magna Carta for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Act, Barangay Kabuhayan Act, the Magna Carta on Women, University of the Philippines Charter of 2008, Bacolor Rehabilitation Council Act, Tourism Act of 2009, Universal Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention Act of 2009, Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, and the Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act. The Climate Change Act was lauded by the United Nations as the &#x27;best in the world&#x27;. She co-authored the National Cultural Heritage Act. Aside from her legislative work, she also established the Luntiang Pilipinas (Green Philippines) foundation, an organization aimed to aid the Philippines in attaining its United Nations mandate for reforestation, where the target was set by the UN at 2009.

In 2008, she was chosen as &quot;United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Asia Pacific Regional Champion for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation&quot;, and she participated in the Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction, the BBC World Debate: ‘Prevent or React’, and the Forum on the Human Impact of Climate Change in Geneva, Switzerland. In October 2009, the Climate Change Act was passed. She filed this bill two years ago, citing inspiration from the Albay Declaration, the outcome document of the First National Conference on Climate Change Adaptation, as it called for “the passage of a policy prioritizing climate change adaptation in the national agenda”. She was a member of the Philippine delegation during the 2009 Copenhagen Summit.

===2010 vice presidential bid===

On July 14, 2009, Legarda expressed her interest to run as president during the 2010 elections. On October 23, 2009, during the launch of her humanitarian program &quot;Lingkod Loren in Luneta&quot;, she formally declared her intention to run for vice president in 2010 under Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition with the platform of environmentalism. After Francis Escudero, expected to run for president, left the NPC, she decided that it would be best to stick with the Nacionalista Party&#x27;s presidential candidate, Manny Villar, as a guest-running mate.

Legarda lost her bid for the Philippine vice presidency to Jejomar Binay, placing third in the 2010 Philippine presidential elections. As a result, she continued her term in the Senate. In 2010, Legarda was given chairmanship for the Senate committees on climate change, cultural communities, and foreign affairs. She would later go to the United Nations to deposit the Philippines ratification for the International Criminal Court membership. As a result of Koko Pimentel&#x27;s win in his case against Migz Zubiri, Legarda requested the Supreme Court to allow them to retrieve documents that they submitted as evidence for her electoral protest against de Castro for the reopening of the investigation of electoral cheating in the 2004 and 2007 elections.

===2013 Senate bid, third term===
Legarda was reelected during the 2013 elections, garnering the second highest number of votes among the 12 winning senators. During her third term, she focused on much legislative push for various cultural and environmental bills in the Senate. She also chaired the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resource and the Senate Committee on Finance. Legarda reportedly persuaded former Environment Secretary Gina Lopez to accept the post she was given as she believed and knew Lopez&#x27;s strong management and implementing skills in environmental conservation. Legarda was one of only 8 lawmakers who were in favor of Gina Lopez retaining the environment secretary post during her confirmation hearing which ousted Lopez from her position. She was unable to enter her vote of support or dissent on a Senate resolution which sought to condemn the controversial burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani in November 2016. She was among the 14 senators who filed a resolution urging the Supreme Court to review its ouster decision in regards to the quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno. She spearheaded in the Senate the ratification of more than 10 international treaties.

Legarda continued her environmental work. Environmental bills she filed included the Total Logging Ban bill which aimed to ban logging for 25 years; the International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance bill; a bill establishing the Department of Fisheries, Low Carbon Economy bill, Energy Efficiency and Conservation bill, Final Forest Limits bill, National Land Use Act of the Philippines, Expanded NIPAS Act, People&#x27;s Survival Fund Act, Water Sector Reform bill, and a bill creating the Department of Housing and Urban Development, among others. She also led the investigation on the environmental crisis in Boracay.

She was awarded as a &quot;United Nations Global Champion for Resilience&quot; in 2015 due to her advocacy and actions on climate change and environmentalism. In November 2017, she led the Philippine delegation at the 23rd UN Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn, Germany. She was named the first ever National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Champion during the event as mandated by an international treaty ratified by the UNFCCC. Legarda became part of a special Philippine delegation to the French Senate to discuss about the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. She was named Chevalier (Knight) in the Ordre national de la légion d’Honneur (National Order of the French Legion of Order) by the government of France.

She also focused on the enhancement of Philippine culture and the arts. Her legislative work included the National Writing Systems Bill, which aimed to institutionalize baybayin and other indigenous writing systems as national writing systems and the National Cultural Heritage Act. Legarda pushed for the creation of the Department of Culture and the Arts. On February 7, 2019, a bill which safeguards the 1,446 Gabaldon school heritage buildings of the country, authored by Legarda, was enacted into law. She also spearheaded the return of the Philippines to the Venice Bienniale, the most acclaimed art exposition in the world, after 5 decades of Philippine absence in the exhibitions.

Legarda also filed various indigenous people rights, culture, women&#x27;s rights, and children&#x27;s rights bills. These included the Traditional Property Rights of Indigenous People bill, Indigenous Community Conserved Areas Act, Magna Carta for the Poor bill, Anti-Hazing Law of 2018, and the Anti-Discrimination Bill. Legarda backed the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill in the Senate. She led the Philippine delegation to the United Nations and urged tougher global actions against cybersex and child trafficking. She supported the Philippine Drug War of President Rodrigo Duterte, but said that she does not support the police killings of innocent citizens.

Other bills she filed included a bill to mandate the government to use the Gross Happiness Index used by Bhutan, the Freedom of Information bill (FOI) Philippine Innovation Bill, Solo Parent&#x27;s Welfare bill, War Veterans Reform Bill, Magna Carta for Public School Teachers, Philippine Academic Regalia Act, Domestic Workers Act, and the Election Service Reform bill.

She also sponsored the Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone Boundary agreement between the Philippines and Indonesia, which led to its ratification.

She pursued greater public awareness and public cooperation for the National Museum of the Philippines, National Library of the Philippines, Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, Cultural Center of the Philippines, the country&#x27;s own culture and arts commission, indigenous communities in the country, Philippines heritage conservation and restoration, intangible cultural heritage of the country, indigenous Philippine weaving, greater appreciation of Philippine and international art, and support for UNESCO initiatives, including the possible nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to the UNESCO World Heritage List. She also supported the restoration of megalithic churches that were destroyed or damaged by the 2013 Bohol earthquake which affected Central Visayas. The restoration was governed by the National Museum of the Philippines with aid from her office. A number of churches that were affected were in the Tentative List for UNESCO World Heritage Sites. On the same year, she led the Philippine delegation group for UNESCO, and was greeted by UNESCO Secretary-General Irina Bokova. On October 16, 2019, Legarda became a Commissioner of the newly formed international organization, Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA).

==Personal life==
Legarda has residences in Malabon (her paternal hometown) in Metro Manila and in Pandan, Antique (her maternal hometown) in Western Visayas.

In 1989, Legarda married former Batangas Governor Antonio Leviste. Their marriage produced two sons: Lorenzo &quot;Lanz&quot; Leviste and Leandro &quot;Lean&quot; Leviste, founder and president of Solar Philippines, a manufacturer and producer of renewable energy technologies. Legarda and Leviste separated in 2003 and their marriage was annulled in 2008. On May 4, 2022, her son, Lorenzo, disowned her through an open letter in response to her decision to run as a guest candidate under the Marcos-Duterte senatorial slate in the 2022 elections. Lorenzo, who had been living in the United States since he was 18 years old, stated that he was &quot;absolutely disgusted&quot; by her, and condemned her for joining Marcos&#x27; slate. Her younger son, Leandro, would later publish his own letter in support of Legarda.

She is a Colonel in the Philippine Air Force Reserve Corps. The Marawi Sultanate League bestowed the honorary title of &quot;Bai Alabi&quot; (&quot;Princess&quot;) on her. The people of Mountain Province in the Cordillera Mountains gave her the name, &quot;Tukwifi&quot; (Bright Star). Ten indigenous groups in the Davao Region bestowed her the title of &quot;Bai Matumpis&quot;, which means &quot;the one who takes care&quot;. The indigenous people of Panay in the Visayas declared her a “daughter of Panay-Bukidnon” and bestowed her the name, &quot;Cuyong Adlaw Dulpa-an Labaw sa Kadunggan&quot; (Shining Sun Rising in Power). She is known to be very fond of traditional Philippine textiles, and has started the usage trend of such textiles in the halls of Congress. Legarda is also an organic eater, growing the vegetables, fruits, and grains that she eats at her backyard.

Legarda is an environmentalist. She established the Luntiang Pilipinas (Green Philippines) foundation. In December 2017, Legarda and director Brillante Mendoza partnered again for a documentary regarding the environment. The series, entitled, &quot;Our Fragile Earth: Protected Areas of the Philippines,&quot; began airing in ANC on December 8. It was the first ever documentary series focused on the protected areas of the Philippines. The series features the Camotes Island Mangrove Swamp Forest Reserve, El Nido Managed Resource Protected Area, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Sagay Marine Reserve, Mounts Banahaw–San Cristobal Protected Landscape, Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Coron Island, Mount Hamiguitan (UNESCO World Heritage Site), and Lake Sebu, which is part of the Allah Valley Protected Landscape. The series also features the Banaue Rice Terraces, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Verde Island Passage.

She is also the presenter of &quot;Dayaw&quot;, a 6-part series about Philippine heritage and culture. The show has been given a continuous series annually. In January 2018, the fourth season of &quot;Dayaw&quot; premiered in ANC, while a separate show dedicated to Filipino cuisine and raw ingredients is being planned for a later showing. In February 2018, Legarda and the NCCA launched the &quot;Buhay na Buhay&quot; television series which focused on eight living sub-cultures of Filipino culture.

<text>The French ironclad &quot;Gloire&quot; (, &quot;Glory&quot;) was the first ocean-going ironclad, launched in 1859. She was developed after the Crimean War, in response to new developments of naval gun technology, especially the Paixhans guns and rifled guns, which used explosive shells with increased destructive power against wooden ships. Her design was also influenced by the Anglo-French development of ironclad floating batteries to bombard Russian forts during the same war.

== Design and description ==
&quot;Gloire&quot; was designed by the French naval architect Henri Dupuy de Lôme as a 5,630-ton broadside ironclad with a wooden hull. Her 12 cm-thick (4.7 in) armour plates, backed with 43 cm (17 in) of timber, resisted hits by the experimental shooting of the strongest guns of the time (the French 50-pounder and the British 68-pounder) at full charge, at a distance of 20 metres (65 ft).

Her maximum speed was 13.1 knots but other reports suggested no more than 11.75 knots had been attained and that 11 knots was the practical maximum.

As was common for the era, &quot;Gloire&quot; was constructed with sails as well as a steam-powered screw. The original rigging was a light barquentine rig providing 1,096 sq. m (11,800 sq. ft) of surface area. This was later increased to a full rig providing 2,508 sq. m (27,000 sq. ft) of surface.

== Service ==
&quot;Gloire&quot; was launched at the arsenal of Mourillon, Toulon, on 24 November 1859; and entered service in August 1860. She was eliminated from the French fleet registry in 1879, and scrapped in 1883.

The ship underwent preliminary trials in June 1860 with official trials on 20-21 of August, where she achieved 13.5 knots. In September of that year, she escorted the imperial yacht &quot;&quot; carrying Emperor Napoleon III to Algiers. During a storm on the return voyage, the &quot;Gloire&quot; was the sole escort able to remain with the &quot;Aigle&quot;. On 12 November, &quot;Gloire&quot; began comparative trials with the &quot;Algésiras,&quot; culminating in a trial report on 30 March 1861. 

== Importance in naval history ==
As the first ocean-going ironclad, &quot;Gloire&quot; rendered obsolete traditional unarmoured wooden ships-of-the-line, and all major navies soon began to build ironclads of their own.

<text>The Ragwitch is a young adult horror/fantasy novel by Garth Nix. The book was first published in 1990 by Pan Macmillan. It was again published in 1995 by Tor Books and first published in Great Britain in 2005 by HarperCollins.

==Summary==

Julia and her brother, Paul, are spending a day by the beach when they discover a midden. They climb to the top, where Julia discovers a rag doll in a ball of feathers hidden in a nest. It turns out to be a powerful and evil witch, and it possesses Julia and spirits her away through a pyramid of fire. Paul manages to follow them and he finds himself in a strange country desperately unprepared for the return of the Ragwitch. At first, he meets the May Dancers, who after questioning him, lead him to the edge of the forest and set him free. The people of the land aid him as he searches for a way to free his sister, action following at every turn, as both Paul and Julia battle the Ragwitch; Julia from within Her, and Paul from outside. Paul collects several mystical objects from the powerful Elementals, before meeting with the Patchwork King, who forges for him a needle spear in order to kill the Ragwitch. There are no strong fighters to help Paul, no s for him and he must find his own way. Because Paul is no hero, his war is one of bravery and brains, not brawn. Julia tells her own story from the mind of the Ragwitch. Although she is much more courageous than Paul, her war is one of the mind, resisting the power of the Ragwitch from within the witch&#x27;s body.

== Characters ==
Julia: &quot;[S]trong-willed&quot; Julia is Paul&#x27;s sister. She is ensnared by the Ragwitch in the opening chapter.

Paul: The protagonist of the novel. Paul is Julia&#x27;s brother.

<text>The Rainbow is a novel by British author D. H. Lawrence, first published by Methuen &amp; Co. in 1915. It follows three generations of the Brangwen family living in Nottinghamshire, focusing particularly on the individual&#x27;s struggle to growth and fulfilment within the confining structures of English social life. Lawrence&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;Women in Love&quot; is a sequel to &quot;The Rainbow&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;The Rainbow&quot; tells the story of three generations of the Brangwen family, a dynasty of farmers and craftsmen who live in the east Midlands of England, on the borders of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The book spans a period of roughly 65 years from the 1840s to 1905, and shows how the love relationships of the Brangwens change against the backdrop of the increasing industrialisation of Britain. The first central character, Tom Brangwen, is a farmer whose experience of the world does not stretch beyond these two counties; while the last, Ursula, his granddaughter, studies at university and becomes a teacher in the progressively urbanised, capitalist and industrial world.

The book starts with a description of the Brangwen dynasty, then deals with how Tom Brangwen, one of several brothers, fell in love with a Polish refugee and widow, Lydia. The next part of the book deals with Lydia&#x27;s daughter by her first husband, Anna, and her destructive, battle-driven relationship with her husband, Will, the son of one of Tom&#x27;s brothers. The last and most extended part of the book, and also probably the most famous, then deals with Will and Anna&#x27;s daughter, Ursula, and her struggle to find fulfilment for her passionate, spiritual, and sensual nature against the confines of the increasingly materialist and conformist society around her. She experiences a same-sex relationship with a teacher, and a passionate but ultimately doomed love affair with Anton Skrebensky, a British soldier of Polish ancestry. At the end of the book, having failed to find her fulfilment in Skrebensky, she has a vision of a rainbow towering over the Earth, promising a new dawn for humanity:

&quot;She saw in the rainbow the earth&#x27;s new architecture, the old, brittle corruption of houses and factories swept away, the world built up in a living fabric of Truth, fitting to the over-arching heaven.&quot;

==Censorship==
Lawrence&#x27;s frank treatment of sexual desire, and the part it plays within relationships as a natural and even spiritual force of life, caused &quot;The Rainbow&quot; to be prosecuted in an obscenity trial at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on 13 November 1915, as a result of which 1,011 copies were seized and burnt. After this ban, it became unavailable in Britain for 11 years, although editions were available in the United States.

==Sequel==
&quot;The Rainbow&quot; was followed by a sequel in 1920, &quot;Women in Love&quot;. Although Lawrence conceived of the two novels as one, considering the titles &quot;The Sisters&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Ring&quot; for the work, they were published as two separate novels at the urging of his publisher. However, after the negative public reception of &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, Lawrence&#x27;s publisher opted out of publishing the sequel.

Ursula&#x27;s spiritual and emotional quest continues in &quot;Women in Love&quot;, in which she continues to be a main character. This second work follows her into a relationship with Rupert Birkin (often seen as a self-portrait by Lawrence), and follows her sister Gudrun&#x27;s parallel relationship with Birkin&#x27;s friend, Gerald Crich.

==Reception==
The philosopher Roger Scruton argues in &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986) that &quot;because we live in a world structured by gender, the other sex is forever to some extent a mystery to us, with a dimension of experience that we can imagine but never inwardly know.&quot; Scruton believes that the prevailing theme of Lawrence&#x27;s novels is that &quot;In desiring to unite with [the other sex], we are desiring to mingle with something that is deeply – perhaps essentially – not ourselves, and which brings us to experience a character and inwardness that challenge us with their strangeness.&quot; Scruton believes that &quot;The Rainbow&quot; vindicates Lawrence&#x27;s vision. The critic Harold Bloom listed &quot;The Rainbow&quot; in his &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994) as one of the books that have been important and influential in Western culture. In 1999, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Rainbow&quot; forty-eighth on a list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century.

==Adaptations==
In 1988, the BBC produced a television adaptation directed by Stuart Burge, with Imogen Stubbs in the role of Ursula Brangwen. The following year, the novel was adapted into the UK film &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, directed by Ken Russell, who had also directed the 1969 film adaptation &quot;Women in Love&quot;.

In 2021, BBC produced a new two-part radio adaptation of the novel, aired on Radio 4 and starring Cassie Bradley in the role of Ursula and Karl Collins as Tom.

<doc id="722324" wikidata="Q6664316" url="?curid=722324" title="Scout councils (Boy Scouts of America)">
<text>The program of the Boy Scouts of America is administered through 253 local councils, with each council covering a geographic area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Each council receives an annual charter from the National Council and is usually incorporated as a charitable organization. Most councils are administratively divided into districts that directly serve Scout units.

Councils previously fall into one of four regions: Western, Central, Southern, and Northeast. Each region is then subdivided into areas. The total number of councils depends on how they are counted:
* There are 253 individual local councils
* Direct Service covers units outside of local councils— although technically not a council it is assigned a council number
* Greater New York Councils has five boroughs, each with an assigned council number
* Michigan Crossroads Council has four field service councils, each with an assigned council number

==Organization==

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. Councils are headed by a collective of three people known as the &#x27;Key 3&#x27;. The Key 3 consists of the Scout executive, a paid employee who administers a staff of professional Scouters; a council president, a volunteer, serves as the chairman of a volunteer board of directors; and a council commissioner, also a volunteer, coordinates the efforts of trained volunteers who provide direct service to the units (Cub Scout packs, Scouts BSA troops, etc.).

The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of annually elected local community leaders. The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members serve without pay and some are volunteer Scouters working at the unit level. Youth members may be selected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations, and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. Volunteer commissioners lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA, and assures a healthy unit program.

Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner. Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.

==History==

At the time of its incorporation in 1910, and for the first three years of the BSA&#x27;s existence, local councils were formed by any group of men who felt that a Scouting council was needed in their community. Later, local councils could only be formed by charter.

In 1913, the first local council charters were issued to first-class and second-class councils.
First class councils were located in America&#x27;s largest cities at that time: New York City, Boston, Washington DC, and Chicago. Other locations received charters to operate &quot;Area Councils,&quot; which served entire states and portions of other states: Philadelphia, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, and various others.

At first, local councils were known by names rather than by numbers. The practice of giving a name to a council (e.g., Portland Council in Maine, formed in 1925) continued until Scouting underwent an explosion of interest in the late 1920s/early 1930s, which resulted in a larger number of local councils being formed. BSA records note that more than 100 local councils were formed in 1931 alone.

Local councils vary in size, sometimes dramatically. Thatcher Woods Council in the western suburbs of Chicago, for example, consisted of eleven city blocks and a small county forest tract. Santa Ana&#x27;s Orange County Council is defined by the borders of Orange County and encompasses a large, densely populated urban area. The Katahdin Area Council of north-central Maine consists of nearly 18,000 square miles and represents almost one-third of the population and two-thirds of the land area of the state of Maine; it is the largest council east of the Mississippi River. The Philippines Council encompassed the entire Philippines archipelago, making it one of the few councils that comprised an entire nation.

By the end of the 1930s, the BSA had catalogued more than 750 local councils, which made managing and tracking individual &quot;named&quot; councils challenging. In order to better track organizational growth, in the early 1940s the national office undertook a study to determine the best way to manage the myriad councils that now made up the organization.

The first phase of the BSA&#x27;s restructuring occurred in 1945. At first, the nation had been divided into eight districts. That year, the BSA divided the nation into twelve regions, each with a Roman numeral to distinguish themselves from the council number (Region I - XII). Councils in each Region were identified by headquarters city and state. A resolution at the National Meeting in 1945 obligated the BSA to assign council numbers only to those councils within the continental US; those councils located outside the United States were not assigned a council number. In 1949 there were 543 councils.
In 1959, the addition of Alaska and Hawaii as the 49th and 50th states, respectively, disrupted the numbering system and made it much less prominent. Councils generally resumed use of geographical names (e.g., the Flint River Council or the Four Lakes Council) and provided their council number only when giving annual data to the central organization. Use of numbers to identify councils fell into further disuse when some of the smaller local councils found that it was in their best interest to combine with neighboring councils; for example, the Cumberland Council in Somerset, Kentucky combined with the Bluegrass Council in Lexington, Kentucky, and three Councils in northwest Texas combined to become the Northwest Texas Council.

As a result of such mergers, by 1960 the BSA had 490 local Councils, a significant reduction from 532 in 1932. Circa 1960, the BSA renumbered all local Councils in alphabetical order by state and headquarters city. That numbering system remains in use today. In this sequence, Council &quot;Number 1&quot; (not the &#x27;oldest BSA Council&#x27;) was originally called the Choccolocco Council that was headquartered in Anniston, Alabama. That Council, combined with two others, now forms the Greater Alabama Council, headquartered from Huntsville, Alabama. There were several breaks in the numbering sequence, resulting in the highest numeric designation being council 639, the Jim Bridger Council in Wyoming.

Councils outside the US were given numbers that began with 800, which was assigned to the Direct Service Council. Council number 801 was assigned to the Panama Canal Zone Council; 802 was assigned to the EUCOM (later Transatlantic Council); 803 was assigned to the Far East Council; 804 was assigned to the Philippines Area Council; and 805 was initially assigned to Saudi Arabia and parts of the Middle East. Later, this region was restored to the supervision of the Direct Service Council and the number retired.

The BSA also encouraged districts within a council to be in numerical order by the closeness to the Council office, and units were &quot;recommended to be numbered according to the District in which they reside&quot;. However, in 1975 the BSA changed its policy and authorized individual councils to provide local numbers as they saw fit.

In 1967 the BSA expanded its council numbers above 639, when it allowed the Greater New York Councils, consisting of the five boroughs in New York City along with the City itself their own Council number (NYC, #640; then in alphabetical order, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). In 1971, the BSA started a new row of Council numbers starting with the Rainbow Council in Morris, Illinois (#702).

In 1976, the BSA allowed the Boston Council and the other councils surrounding Boston (Cambridge, Minuteman, and North Bay) to form a &quot;consolidated council&quot; similar to the way that New York City and the five boroughs were organized. This consolidated council was designated as council 850. However, the effort failed and the councils split again in 1979; eventually the Boston, Cambridge and Minuteman merged into the Boston Minuteman Council, while North Bay became part of the Yankee Clipper, until Boston Minuteman and Yankee Clipper merged to become the Spirit of Adventure Council.

==Councils by size==

The BSA categorizes councils by size. Currently, there are five categories of council: (1) Mega Councils (the top 20 local Councils by youth membership and units), (2) Metro Councils (the next 20 or so local Councils), (3) Medium Councils, (4) Small Market Councils, and (5) Community Councils, which are the smallest, normally taking in large neighborhoods or one or two cities. Geographically, a council like the Montana Council serving most of the state of Montana, or the Midnight Sun Council serving the interior of Alaska have the largest coverage areas, but relatively few Scouts. Council size may also fluctuate because of mergers, like the repeated merger and splitting of the Monterey Bay Area Council (#025) and the Santa Clara County Council (#055).

The BSA implements a system to classify the councils. For simplicity, the systems is based on the organization’s budget.
*Class 100 – typically a $7M, $10MM+ (the largest councils)
*Class 200 – $4M to $7M
*Class 300 – $2 to $3MM 
*Class 400 – $1 to $2 MM
*Class 500 – Under $1MM
The budget gives an idea of scale of management expertise needed and progressive experiences. This system was set in place circa 2000 and has not been adjusted post COVID, LDS departure and the Chapter 11 proceedings. 

Each council is also assigned a grade (1-4), similar to the locality adjustment of the US civil service pay scale.
===Largest councils===

===Smallest councils===
The Piedmont Council is the last small council after the Alameda Council and Cambridge Council merged with larger councils.

The Greenwich Council serves the single town of Greenwich, Connecticut.

==Unique councils==

The Greater New York Councils is the only council in the nation divided into smaller councils. It is divided into five borough councils with each led by a field director and one or more district directors or district executives. Conversely, due to Scouting population and geographic distance, the Utah National Parks Council is organized into 39 districts divided among 12 geographic sectors, with each led by a volunteer assistant vice president and assistant council commissioner with each sector.

The organization of the councils in Area 2 of the Central Region is unique to Michigan. The Michigan Crossroads Council was created by the merger of nine councils in the lower peninsula of Michigan. It was a coordinating council that oversaw properties, personnel, and program. This MCC was then split into four sub-councils or &quot;Field Service Councils&quot; which were then divided into districts. In 2019, plans to combine the four sub- councils into two regions we&#x27;re announced. The lower peninsula, excluding parts of Berrien and Cass county, is now all under the Michigan Crossroads Council. 

==Overseas areas==
The BSA charters two councils for American Scouts living overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia. The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, serves BSA units in much of Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia. While the Far East Council, headquartered at Camp Zama in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Okinawa, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Cambodia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

The Direct Service branch enables U.S. citizens and their dependents abroad to access Scouting programs in other locations and in isolated areas, including the Interamerican Region (North, Central, and South America, and the Caribbean). Direct Service is managed by the National Capital Area Council.

==Defunct councils==

The local councils have gone through thousands of name changes, merges, splits and re-creations since the establishment of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910.

<text>In security studies and international relations, a police action is a military action undertaken without a formal declaration of war. In the 21st century, the term has been largely supplanted by &quot;counter-insurgency&quot;. Since World War II, formal declarations of war have been rare, especially military actions conducted by the Global North during the Cold War. Rather, nations involved in military conflict (especially the great powers) sometimes describe the conflict by fighting the war under the auspices of a &quot;police action&quot; to show that it is a limited military operation, different from total war.

The earliest use of the phrase dates back to 1883, describing attempts by Dutch and British forces to liberate the 28-man crew of the SS &quot;Nisero&quot;, who were held hostage in Sumatra. The Dutch term (police actions) was used for this. The Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary: Eleventh Edition called it in its 1933 issue; a localized military action undertaken without formal declaration of war by regular armed forces against persons (as guerrillas or aggressors) held to be violators of international peace and order. It was also used to imply a formal claim of sovereignty by colonial powers, such as in the military actions of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Western powers during conflicts such as the Indonesian National Revolution and the Malayan Emergency.

==Examples of police actions==
The various Banana Wars, from April 21, 1898, to August 1, 1934, were called police actions by the US government.

The two major Dutch military offensives, of July 1947 and December 1948, during the Indonesian National Revolution were referred to by the Dutch government as the first and second .

The 1948 action, by India, against Hyderabad State, code named Operation Polo, was referred to as a police action by the government.

In the early days of the Korean War, American President Harry S. Truman referred to the United States&#x27; responses to the North Korean invasion of South Korea as a &quot;police action&quot; under the aegis of the United Nations. During a June 1950 press conference, he explicitly remarked that the &quot;United Nations Security Council held a meeting and passed on the situation and asked the members to go to the relief of the Korean Republic&quot; with the aims &quot;to suppress a bandit raid&quot; occurring. A retrospective piece on the fighting from the Canadian news publication &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; in 2023 said &quot;[the]&quot; conflict left 515 Canadians dead — yet for years it was not even called a war&quot; due to the terminology of it being &quot;referred to as a &#x27;police action&#x27;.&quot; Writer Tom MacGregor noted for the news agency that even when the &quot;sailors, soldiers and air personnel came home... there were no parades or official recognition for the war they had fought&quot;, although eventually the &quot;Korean War was added to the National War Memorial in Ottawa&quot; such that after 1982 &quot;its veterans can stand with all other veterans who have served.&quot;

Shortly after the secession of Biafra in 1967, which took place during a period of chaotic political turmoil, the Nigerian military government launched a &quot;police action&quot; to retake the secessionist territory, and the rising violence turned into the Nigerian Civil War. During a May 2017 remembrance event, Ohanaeze Ndigbo leader John Nnia Nwodo stated that &quot;Nigeria faced disintegration by the declaration of the Republic of Biafra&quot; and lamented how the &quot;commencement of a police action that turned into a three years civil war&quot; caused &quot;sacrifice– in blood, suffering and toil&quot;.

The Vietnam War and the Kargil War were undeclared wars and hence are sometimes described as police actions.

The Soviet–Afghan War was an undeclared war and hence also could be described as a police action, especially since the initial troop deployments into Afghanistan were at the request of the Afghan government.

In other events, the Congress (of the United States) had not made a formal declaration of war, yet the President, as the commander-in-chief, has claimed authority to send in the armed forces when he deemed necessary, with or without the approval of Congress. The legal legitimacy of each of these actions was based upon declarations such as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and Iraq Resolution by Congress and various United Nations resolutions. Nonetheless, Congressional approval has been asserted by means of funding appropriations or other authorizations as well as the contested War Powers Resolution.

The United Nations approved police action during the 2011 military intervention in Libya to protect civilians.
Since the September 11 attacks, states have militarily pursued individuals they deem terrorists within the borders of other states in a form of police action that is not clearly defined in the international law.

So-called &quot;Indonesian security forces&quot; use police actions against uprisings of Papuans in the easternmost province. The Indonesian police have been empowered to lead the counterinsurgency operation against the Free Papuan Movement (OPM). Nonetheless, the Indonesian police&#x27;s deficiencies in battling OPM require that the police maintain a strong partnership with the Indonesian military.

===Under international law===

Police actions are authorized specifically by the Security Council under Article 53 (for regional action) or Article 42 (for global action). In both cases, the term used in the Charter text (English) is &#x27;enforcement action&#x27;; the term &#x27;police action&#x27; is not used.

==Appropriate use of the term==
Use of the term does not appear to have gained currency outside of the limited arena of justification of military action: for example, the U.S. Navy refers to the Korean conflict as the Korean War, and when they refer to police action, they surround the term in quotation marks.

Similarly, a plaque at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial refers to the Vietnam War as a war, not a police action, even though it was undeclared.

Use of the term &quot;police action&quot; is intended to imply either a claim of formal sovereignty or of authority to intervene militarily at a nation&#x27;s own discretion, typically unilaterally or with a small group of nations. This is often done through the United Nations or by asserting that the military operation is defensive or humanitarian in nature such as the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti or the Invasion of Grenada.

<text>Jakob Luke Dylan (born December 9, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter of the rock band the Wallflowers, which he formed in 1989.

Born in New York City to musician Bob Dylan and model Sara Lownds, Dylan began his musical career in various indie bands before creating the Wallflowers. As its frontman and lead vocalist, he wrote and performed the band&#x27;s hit songs including &quot;One Headlight&quot;, &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot;, &quot;The Difference&quot; and &quot;Three Marlenas&quot;—the former of which was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Pop Songs&quot;, and won two Grammy Awards. With the Wallflowers, Dylan has released seven studio albums. 

As a solo act, Dylan signed with Columbia Records to release two studio albums—&quot;Seeing Things&quot; (2008) and &quot;Women + Country&quot; (2010)—the latter of which peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Early life==
Dylan was born on December 9, 1969, in New York City to folk singer Bob Dylan (né Robert Zimmerman) and model Sara Lownds (née Shirley Noznisky). His parents are both of Jewish descent. The youngest of five children, Dylan spent the earliest years of his life in Greenwich Village. Around the age of three, he moved with his family to the Los Angeles area. Growing up, he listened to English rock records from his older brothers&#x27; record collection, including the Clash, the Jam, and Buzzcocks. Dylan was particularly impressed with the Clash, who inspired him to begin playing music himself.

During high school, Dylan played guitar in various bands; he was featured as a guitar player on his friends&#x27; band&#x27;s eponymous 1987 album, &quot;Trash Matinee&quot;. Dylan was also in a band called the Bootheels at the time with future Wallflowers bandmate Tobi Miller. During this time, Dylan started writing songs and began shifting his focus from guitar playing to songwriting. Upon graduation from high school, however, Dylan decided to move back to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design to study art. Dylan dropped out in his first semester and returned to Los Angeles to pursue music.

==Career==

===1989–2005: The Wallflowers===

Upon moving back to Los Angeles, Dylan and childhood friend Tobi Miller formed a new band called the Apples around 1989, along with Luther Russell on bass guitar and Aaron A. Brooks on drums. Both Russell and Brooks later departed to start their own respective bands. Dylan and Miller then recruited Barrie Maguire on bass, Peter Yanowitz on drums, and Rami Jaffee on keyboards to fill out the new band. The Apples changed their name to The Wallflowers and began playing clubs in Los Angeles. They were eventually signed to Virgin Records, and in 1991, The Wallflowers began recording their debut album. Dylan wrote the songs and the album was recorded live in the studio with minimal to no overdubbing. The Wallflowers&#x27; eponymous debut was released on August 25, 1992. The album was met with mostly positive reviews but did not do well commercially, with a reported 40,000 copies sold. Despite low sales, The Wallflowers began touring nationwide, mostly as an opening act for several bands including the Spin Doctors and 10,000 Maniacs.

Upon returning from a tour in 1993, the band learned that management at Virgin had shifted, leading to the removal of Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, who had signed The Wallflowers to the label. The new executives at Virgin were not pleased with The Wallflowers&#x27; slow sales and the band did not feel they had a future with the label, so they asked to be released from their contract; Virgin complied and by the end of the year, The Wallflowers were left without a label. The band went back to playing clubs in Los Angeles and looking for a new label. During this time, the band went through a number of personnel changes. In 1993, Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons. The band would continue playing shows with another bass player, Jimmie Snider, until May 1993, when the band found a permanent replacement. Greg Richling, whom Dylan went to high school with, became the band&#x27;s new bassist. Richling remained a member of The Wallflowers for the next two decades, until he left in 2013. The band continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through mid-1994; it was around this time when Yanowitz left The Wallflowers to join 10,000 Maniacs, then fronted by his girlfriend, Natalie Merchant. Shortly after Yanowitz&#x27;s departure, The Wallflowers caught the attention of Tom Whalley and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records, who signed the band in 1995.

The Wallflowers began recording their second album, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; in 1995. Around the time they began recording founding member Tobi Miller left the band. A number of guitarists stepped in to finish the album. &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot; was produced by T Bone Burnett and the songs were written by Dylan. The album was released on May 21, 1996, and became the band&#x27;s most successful album, reaching quadruple platinum status in the U.S. To promote the release, the band toured extensively through the rest of 1996 and through 1997. The Wallflowers now included drummer Mario Calire and guitarist Michael Ward, in addition to Dylan, Jaffee and Richling. The band performed shows as headliners, as well as openers for acts such as Sheryl Crow in early 1997 and Counting Crows in the summer of 1997. They also opened for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in January 1997, as well as for the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan in November 1997. In June 1997, Dylan was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In the issue&#x27;s accompanying interview, Dylan spoke at length about his lineage for the first time.

After touring for nearly two years, The Wallflowers took a short break before returning to the studio to record their third album, &quot;(Breach)&quot;. Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for The Wallflowers&#x27; two previous albums, explaining that he didn&#x27;t want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: &quot;&quot;(Breach)&quot; was the first record that I realized that it&#x27;s necessary and I have a right to write about anything that I want to write about. I&#x27;m not going to dance around these subjects anymore ... I don&#x27;t have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don&#x27;t come naturally to me but I also realized that I needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore.&quot;

The Wallflowers entered the studio towards the end of 1999 with producers Michael Penn and Andrew Slater, The Wallflowers&#x27; manager. &quot;(Breach)&quot; took about eight months to record and was released on October 10, 2000. The Wallflowers embarked on a tour that lasted through the end of 2000 and into 2001, making stops in Japan and Madison Square Garden in New York for a four-night run, opening for the Who. In October 2000, Dylan was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for a second time. In October 2001, guitarist Michael Ward announced he was leaving The Wallflowers, citing creative differences.

Dylan began writing for The Wallflowers&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; in 2001. The band recorded demos while on tour with John Mellencamp that year before getting into the studio in Santa Monica, California. Due to the absence of a lead guitarist during the recording for &quot;Red Letter Days&quot;, Dylan took on more lead guitar duties than he had previously. &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller and Bill Appleberry. Following the release of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;When You&#x27;re On Top&quot; on August 16, 2002, &quot;Red Letter Days&quot; was released on November 5, 2002. Following tours in the US and Europe, drummer Mario Calire announced he was leaving The Wallflowers in 2003.

The Wallflowers returned to the studio in July 2004 to record their fifth album, &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot;. Instead of recording in Los Angeles, The Wallflowers instead opted to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which was where their producer for this album, Brendan O&#x27;Brien, was based. To replace drummer Mario Calire, Fred Eltringham joined The Wallflowers just before getting into the studio. In addition to writing the songs, Dylan also painted the cover art for this album. &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot; was released on May 24, 2005. The Wallflowers toured through the summer of 2005, joined by guitarist Stuart Mathis, on what would be their last tour for 2 years. After 2005, The Wallflowers parted ways with their longtime record label, Interscope Records.

===2006–2011: Solo career===
Beginning in 2006, Dylan began playing shows without The Wallflowers, though he did tour with the band on numerous occasions between 2007 and 2009. In May and June 2006, Dylan toured with former Wallflowers producer T Bone Burnett, performing solo acoustic opening sets. In fall of that year, Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Here Comes Now&quot; was featured as the theme song for an ABC drama, &quot;Six Degrees&quot;. Also in the fall of 2006, it was announced that Dylan had signed a solo recording contract with Columbia Records.

====&quot;Seeing Things&quot;====
In 2007, Dylan appeared on several tribute albums, including &quot;Endless Highway: The Music of the Band&quot; and &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;, a charity album consisting of covers of John Lennon songs. On &quot;Endless Highway&quot;, Dylan performed a cover of the Band&#x27;s &quot;Whispering Pines.&quot; For &quot;Instant Karma&quot;, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Gimme Some Truth,&quot; with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.
In September 2007, it was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s home in the Hollywood Hills. Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described the differences in the writing process for &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, compared to writing for The Wallflowers:

Following the completion of recording in 2007, &quot;Seeing Things&quot; was released on June 10, 2008. The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the US on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called the Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the US, Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts, and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with The Wallflowers in 2008.

====&quot;Women + Country&quot;====
In 2009, Dylan visited T Bone Burnett at a studio where Burnett was producing the soundtrack for the film Crazy Heart. Burnett asked Dylan if he had any new songs to show him. The only song Dylan had was one he had written for Glen Campbell&#x27;s forthcoming album, &quot;Ghost on the Canvas&quot;, called &quot;Nothing But the Whole Wide World.&quot; Burnett was impressed by the song and asked Dylan to come up with fifteen additional songs so they could put an album together. Dylan came back to Burnett six weeks later with the songs and in 2009 they recorded Dylan&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Women + Country&quot;.

&quot;Women + Country&quot; had a decidedly fuller sound than &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, thanks to the horns, pedal steel and fiddle that were prominently featured throughout the album. Burnett also brought in Neko Case and Kelly Hogan to contribute background vocals on eight of the album&#x27;s eleven songs.

After releasing an EP version of the album earlier that year, &quot;Women + Country&quot; was released on April 6, 2010, on Columbia Records. The album was met with generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.12 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;; the highest position any of Dylan&#x27;s albums – solo or with The Wallflowers – had peaked since The Wallflowers&#x27; 1996 breakthrough album, &quot;Bringing Down the Horse&quot;. In addition to a series of television appearances to promote the album, Dylan and a backing band called Three Legs toured the U.S., the United Kingdom and Ireland in the spring and summer of 2010. At a stop at the Bearsville Theater in Woodstock, New York, Dylan was joined on stage by Garth Hudson of the Band for several songs.

Also in 2010, Dylan sang backing vocals on the Court Yard Hounds&#x27; song &quot;See You In the Spring.&quot; Along with being released on the Court Yard Hounds&#x27; eponymous debut album, the song was specially released as a 45 RPM single for Record Store Day, 2010. Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Hurting&quot; from &quot;Women + Country&quot; was featured as the B-side to the record.

In 2011, Dylan was featured on several film and television soundtracks, including &quot;A Little Help&quot;, for which he wrote three songs, and &quot;True Blood: Vol.3&quot;, for which he wrote a song with Gary Louris called &quot;Gonna Be a Darkness.&quot; Dylan was also featured on the 2011 album, &quot;The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams&quot;; an album featuring various artists covering previously &quot;lost&quot; lyrics by Hank Williams. In August 2011, Dylan and Wallflowers keyboardist Rami Jaffee performed at the Farm Aid benefit concert in Kansas City.

===2012–present: Return of The Wallflowers and other projects===

On November 1, 2011, it was announced that The Wallflowers would be reuniting to release a sixth studio album the following year. The Wallflowers had toured on and off during their hiatus but had not made an album together since 2005&#x27;s &quot;Rebel, Sweetheart&quot;.

The Wallflowers recorded their sixth studio album, &quot;Glad All Over&quot;, in Nashville, Tennessee, in early 2012. Shortly before entering the studio, the band replaced drummer Fred Eltringham with Jack Irons. The writing process was different for this album than previous Wallflowers albums; instead of Dylan bringing in completed songs, he brought only lyrics to the studio, and as a band they wrote the music for the songs. The Wallflowers toured throughout the summer and fall of 2012. &quot;Glad All Over&quot; was released on October 9, 2012, on Columbia Records. In the spring of 2013, The Wallflowers did an arena tour opening for Eric Clapton.

In 2013, The Wallflowers went through a number of personnel changes, beginning with longtime keyboard player Rami Jaffee. Jaffee played his last show with The Wallflowers to date in 2013 but has since not officially announced that he quit the band. Later that year, longtime bass player Greg Richling and drummer Jack Irons announced that they were leaving The Wallflowers, citing that they wanted to focus on a band they were both in called Arthur Channel. A number of drummers and bass players filled in as The Wallflowers continued to tour through the end of 2016.

Aside from work with The Wallflowers, Dylan has played a key role in several other projects. In early 2013, Dylan, along with Dave Matthews, Charlie Sexton, Brady Blade, and Sexton&#x27;s brother Will, wrote and recorded an album in Shreveport, Louisiana, as a new band called the Nauts. The album has yet to be released.

In September 2015, Dylan released a duet online with Cat Power covering the Byrds&#x27; &quot;You Showed Me&quot; (which was later popularized by the Turtles). The song is a track on the 2019 studio album called &quot;Echo in the Canyon&quot;, in which Dylan covers songs in duets by 1960s-era Southern California folk rock artists, such as the Turtles, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Buffalo Springfield, and the Beach Boys. Dylan, along with Regina Spektor, Cat Power, Beck, Fiona Apple, and Jade Castrinos, performed these songs in a concert at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles in October 2015. The creation of &quot;Echo in the Canyon&quot; led Dylan, along with manager Andrew Slater, to create a feature-length documentary about the project, as well as the Laurel Canyon music scene. The film premiered at the &quot;LA Film Festival&quot; on September 20, 2018, and has been positively received.

==Personal life==
Dylan married his girlfriend Paige, a screenwriter, in 1992. The couple have four sons together and live in Los Angeles. The couple are raising their children in the Jewish faith. Dylan had a bar mitzvah, the ceremony that marks Jewish teenage boys&#x27; religious coming of age. As an adult, Jakob has said that he considers himself Jewish, regardless of his parents&#x27; past or current religious affiliations. In 2005, Dylan spoke about his relationship with his father, Bob Dylan, for the first time in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Because Dylan rarely speaks about his father, there have been ongoing rumors that their relationship is strained. Dylan rebuffed these claims, speaking of his father as &quot;affectionate&quot; towards him and went on to say the two have a &quot;great relationship&quot;.

In May 2011, Dylan was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Idaho State University.

===Philanthropy===
Dylan is a supporter of diabetes awareness and was given a Father of the Year award from the American Diabetes Association on June 4, 2014. The award recognizes men who &quot;have made family a priority, while balancing a demanding career and community involvement&quot;. Dylan is also a supporter of Crohn&#x27;s and colitis awareness. Each year since 2012, he has provided musical entertainment for an annual event put on by Connecting to Cure, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting awareness and funding research to cure Crohn&#x27;s and colitis.

<doc id="722332" wikidata="Q947050" url="?curid=722332" title="Treaty of Edinburgh">
<text>The Treaty of Edinburgh (also known as the Treaty of Leith) was a treaty drawn up on 5 July 1560 between the Commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I of England with the assent of the Scottish Lords of the Congregation, and the French representatives of King Francis II of France (husband of Mary Queen of Scots) to formally conclude the siege of Leith and replace the Auld Alliance with France with a new Anglo-Scottish accord, while maintaining the peace between England and France agreed by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis.

==French and English troops in Scotland==
The rule of Mary of Guise in Scotland was supported by French troops. Scottish Protestants challenged her rule in the Reformation Crisis. During the ensuing Siege of Leith, French troops fortified the port and town of Leith against an English and Scottish Protestant force. The English army was invited into Scotland by the Treaty of Berwick made by the Lords of the Congregation. The treaty was concluded on 6 July 1560 just short of a month after the death of Mary of Guise. The fortifications at Leith, Inchkeith and Dunbar Castle were duly removed, and the French garrisons left Scotland. Other conditions discussed involved the joint use of English and French heraldry by Mary, Queen of Scots. 

Remains of an artillery fort involved in the siege were found in 2006 in Edinburgh&#x27;s Pilrig Park, and two gun emplacements can be seen on Leith Links.

==Terms of the treaty==
The representatives were Jean de Monluc, Bishop of Valence, and Charles de la Rochefoucault, Sieur de Randan, for France, with William Cecil and Nicholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury and York. The French deputes were authorised to discuss the withdrawal of their troops with the Archbishop of St Andrews, John Bellenden of Auchnoul, and William Maitland as representatives of the Congregation. The French delegation was also permitted to meet and console the bereaved ladies-in-waiting of Mary of Guise&#x27;s court. The cessation of hostilities during the negotiation was marked by two cannon shots from Edinburgh Castle at 7 o&#x27;clock in the evening of Monday 17 June.

It was agreed between France and England that all their land and naval forces would withdraw from Scotland. Mary and Francis II of France should not use the arms and signs of England and Ireland in their heraldry. Mary and Francis would fulfill the representations made by the nobility and people of Scotland on 6 July 1560.

==Ratification==
The terms of this treaty are occasionally confused with the acts of the Reformation Parliament of 1560 which met in August, and sought to establish the Protestant church in Scotland.
However the treaty was not ratified by Mary Stuart, the reigning Scottish monarch at the time, despite considerable pressure upon her until 1567. Even so, it had the intended effect of the withdrawal of French troops from Scotland at the time, and the eventual fall of the Catholic Church in Scotland.

Mary may not have wanted the Treaty to be ratified as she was heavily attached to France, having been its queen consort, and viewed the Lords of the Congregation as rebels against her mother Mary of Guise. She also did not ratify the treaty because it officially declared Elizabeth the monarch of England, a position Mary desired for herself. The Gowrie Regime attempted to ratify the treaty in April 1583.

<doc id="722337" wikidata="Q153832" url="?curid=722337" title="Alcide De Gasperi">
<text>Alcide Amedeo Francesco De Gasperi (3 April 1881 – 19 August 1954) was an Italian politician and statesman who founded the Christian Democracy party and served as prime minister of Italy in eight successive coalition governments from 1945 to 1953.

De Gasperi was the last prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy, serving under both Victor Emmanuel III and Umberto II. He was also the first prime minister of the Italian Republic, and also briefly served as provisional head of state after the Italian people voted to end the monarchy and establish a republic. His eight-year term in office remains a landmark of political longevity for a leader in modern Italian politics. De Gasperi is the fifth longest-serving prime minister since the Italian Unification.

A devout Catholic, he was one of the founding fathers of the European Union along with fellow Italian Altiero Spinelli.

==Early years==
De Gasperi was born in 1881 in Pieve Tesino in Tyrol, now part of the Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige, which at that time belonged to Austria-Hungary. His father was a local police officer of limited financial means. From 1896 De Gasperi was active in the Social Christian movement. In 1900 he joined the Faculty of Literature and Philosophy in Vienna, where he played an important role in the inception of the Christian student movement. He was very much inspired by the &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. In 1904 he took an active part in student demonstrations in favour of an Italian language university. Imprisoned with other protesters during the inauguration of the Italian faculty of law in Innsbruck, he was released after twenty days. In 1905, De Gasperi obtained a degree in philology.

In 1905, he began to work as editor of the newspaper &quot;La Voce Cattolica&quot; (The Catholic Voice) which was replaced in September 1906 by &quot;Il Trentino&quot; and he soon became its editor. In his newspaper, he often took positions in favour of a cultural autonomy for Trentino and in defence of Italian culture in Trentino, in contrast to the Germanisation plans of the German nationalists in Tyrol. At the time, in disagreement with other politicians like Cesare Battisti, he did not seek unification with Italy.

In 1911, he became a member of Parliament for the Popular Political Union of Trentino (UPPT) in the Austrian Reichsrat, a post he held for six years. At the beginning of World War I, he was politically neutral, sympathizing with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of Pope Benedict XV and Karl I of Austria to obtain an honourable peace and stop the war. Ultimately, he sided with Italy.

===Opposition to Fascism===
In 1919, he was among the founders of the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI), with Luigi Sturzo. He served as a deputy in the Italian Parliament from 1921 to 1924, a period marked by the rise of Fascism. He initially supported the participation of the PPI in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s first government in October 1922.

As Mussolini&#x27;s hold on the Italian government grew stronger, he soon diverged with the Fascists over constitutional changes to the powers of the executive and to the election system (the Acerbo Law), and to Fascist violence against the constitutional parties, culminating in the murder of Giacomo Matteotti. The PPI split, and De Gasperi became secretary of the remaining anti-Fascist group in May 1924. In November 1926, in a climate of overt violence and intimidation by the Fascists, the PPI was dissolved.

De Gasperi was arrested in March 1927 and sentenced to four years in prison. The Vatican negotiated his release. A year and a half in prison nearly broke De Gasperi&#x27;s health. After his release in July 1928, he was unemployed and in serious financial hardship, until in 1929 his ecclesiastical contacts secured him a job as a cataloger in the Vatican Library, where he spent the next fourteen years until the collapse of Fascism in July 1943.

During the 1930s, De Gasperi wrote a regular international column for the review &quot;L&#x27;Illustrazione Vaticana&quot; in which he depicted the chief political battle as one between communism and Christianity. In 1934, he rejoiced in the defeat of the Austrian Social Democrats, whom he condemned for &quot;de-Christianizing&quot; the country, and in 1937 he declared that the German Church was correct in preferring Nazism to Bolshevism.

===Founding Christian Democracy===
During World War II, he organized the establishment of the first (and at the time, illegal) Christian Democracy (DC) party, drawing upon the ideology of the PPI. In January 1943, he published &quot;Ideas for Reconstruction&quot; (), which amounted to a program for the party. He became the first general secretary of the new party in 1944.

De Gasperi was the undisputed head of the Christian Democrats, the party that dominated Parliament for decades. Although his control of the DC appeared almost complete, he had to carefully balance different factions and interests, especially with regard to relations with the Vatican, social reform, and foreign policy.

When Southern Italy was liberated by the Allies, he became one of the main representatives of DC in the National Liberation Committee. During the government led by Ivanoe Bonomi, De Gasperi was appointed minister without portfolio and, in Ferruccio Parri&#x27;s cabinet, he became minister of foreign affairs.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

From 1945 to 1953, he was the prime minister of eight successive DC-led governments. His eight-year rule remains a landmark of political longevity for one leader in modern Italian politics. During his successive governments, Italy became a republic (1946), signed a peace treaty with the Allies (1947), joined NATO in 1949 and became an ally of the United States, which helped to revive the Italian economy through the Marshall Plan. During that time, Italy became a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which later evolved into the European Union (EU). Crucial in this regard was the contribution of Defense Minister Randolfo Pacciardi, a 30th degree Mason of the Scottish Rite, who had been personally chosen by De Gasperi.

In December 1945, he became prime minister for the first time, succeeding Ferruccio Parri and leading a coalition government that included both Italian Communist Party (PCI) and Italian Socialist Party (PSI), along with other minor parties like Italian Republican Party (PRI), Italian Liberal Party (PLI) and Action Party (PdA). Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti acted as deputy prime minister. He tried to soften the terms of the pending Allied peace treaty with Italy and secured financial and economic aid through the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) – which was opposed by the Communists.

In June 1946, a constitutional referendum to decide whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic resulted in 54% of the vote favouring a republic. De Gasperi served as provisional head of state from 12 June 1946 until the Constituent Assembly elected Liberal politician Enrico De Nicola provisional head of state on 28 June 1946.

As chief of the Italian delegation at the World War II peace conference in Paris, De Gasperi harshly criticized the sanctions imposed on Italy, but obtained concessions from the Allies that guaranteed Italian sovereignty. Under the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, the eastern border area was lost to Yugoslavia and the free territory of Trieste was divided between the two states.
One of his most striking achievements in foreign policy was the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement with Austria in September 1946, which established his home region, South Tyrol, as an autonomous region.

===American support===
De Gasperi enjoyed considerable support in the US, where he was considered able to oppose the rising tide of communism – in particular the PCI, which was the biggest communist party in a Western European democracy. In January 1947 he visited the US. The chief goals of the trip were to soften the terms of the pending peace treaty with Italy and to obtain immediate economic assistance. His ten-day tour, engineered by media mogul Henry Luce – the owner of &quot;Time&quot; magazine – and his wife, Clare Boothe Luce – the future ambassador to Rome – was viewed as a media &quot;triumph&quot;, prompting positive comments by a wide section of the American press.

During his meetings in the United States, De Gasperi managed to secure a financially modest but politically significant US$100 million Eximbank loan to Italy. According to De Gasperi, public opinion would view the loan as a vote of confidence in the Italian Government and strengthen his position versus the PCI in the context of the emerging Cold War. The positive results strengthened De Gasperi&#x27;s reputation in Italy. He also came back with useful information on the incipient change in American foreign policy that would lead to the Cold War and in Italy the break with the PCI and left-wing PSI and their removal from the government in the May 1947 crisis.

In May 1947, United States President Harry Truman ordered De Gasperi to create a new government without the support of communists and socialists; he refused and a new cabinet was formed with the (centrist) Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI) of Giuseppe Saragat, the PLI of Luigi Einaudi and the PRI of Randolfo Pacciardi; the three leaders of the minor parties were appointed deputy prime ministers.

===General election in 1948===
The general elections in April 1948 were heavily influenced by the Cold War era confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the Soviet-orchestrated February 1948 Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the left-wing coalition were to win the elections, the Soviet-funded PCI would draw Italy into the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence.

In the United States, a campaign was launched to prevent a victory of the Communist-dominated Popular Democratic Front (FDP). Italian Americans were encouraged to write letters to their relatives in Italy. The popular Italian-American singer Frank Sinatra made a Voice of America radio broadcast. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funnelled &quot;black bag&quot; contributions to anti-communist candidates with the approval of the National Security Council and President Harry S. Truman. Joseph P. Kennedy and Clare Booth Luce helped to raise US$2 million for the Christian Democracy party. &quot;Time&quot; magazine backed the campaign and featured De Gasperi on its 19 April 1948 issue&#x27;s cover and in its lead story. He would appear on a &quot;Time&quot; cover again on 25 May 1953, during the campaign for that year&#x27;s election, with an extensive biography.

The election campaign remains unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy&#x27;s history on both sides. The election was between two competing visions of the future of Italian society. On the one hand, a Roman Catholic, conservative and capitalist Italy, represented by the governing Christian Democrats of De Gasperi; on the other, a secular, revolutionary and socialist society, represented by the Popular Democratic Front. The Christian Democrat campaign claimed that in Communist countries &quot;children send parents to jail&quot;, &quot;children are owned by the state&quot;, &quot;people eat their own children&quot;, and assured voters that disaster would strike Italy if the Left were to take power. Another slogan was, &quot;In the secrecy of the polling booth, God sees you – Stalin doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

The PCI were &quot;de facto&quot; leading the Popular Democratic Front, and had effectively marginalized the PSI, which eventually suffered because of this in these elections, in terms of parliamentary seats and political power. The Socialists also had been hurt by the secession of a social-democratic faction led by Giuseppe Saragat, which contested the election with the concurrent list of Socialist Unity.

The PCI had difficulties in restraining its more militant members, who, in the period immediately after the war, had engaged in violent acts of reprisals. The areas affected by the violence (the so-called &quot;Red Triangle&quot; of Emilia, or parts of Liguria around Genoa and Savona, for instance) had previously seen episodes of brutality committed by the Fascists during Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime and the Italian Resistance during the Allies&#x27; gradual advance through Italy.

The Christian Democrats won a resounding victory with 48.5% of the vote (their best result ever) and strong majorities in both the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The Communists received only half of the votes they had in 1946. With absolute majorities in both chambers, De Gasperi could have formed an exclusively Christian Democratic government. Instead, he formed a &quot;centrist&quot; coalition with the Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats. De Gasperi formed three ministries, the second in 1950 after the defection of the Liberals, who hoped for more rightist policies, and the third in 1951 after the defection of the Social Democrats, who hoped for more left-wing policies. He ruled for five more years, helming four additional coalitions. &quot;De Gasperi&#x27;s policy is patience&quot;, according to the foreign news correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anne O&#x27;Hare McCormick. &quot;He seems to be feeling his way among the explosive problems he has to deal with, but perhaps this wary mine-detecting method is the stabilising force that holds the country in balance.&quot;

===Social security reforms===

In domestic policy, various ministers of De Gasperi&#x27;s cabinets carried out a number of social security reforms in the areas of rents and social housing, unemployment insurance, and pensions.
On 9 January 1946, the government reorganised the health insurance system for sharecroppers, tenant farmers and agricultural workers, with a flat-rate daily indemnity of Lit.28 for women and Lit.60 for men (i.e. 3% and 7% of the average gross industrial wage for 1947) for a maximum of 180 days a year and free medical and hospital assistance provided through INAM. On 19 April 1946 the government reorganised the health insurance system for industrial employees, with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings, for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity indemnity equal to a lump sum of Lit.1000 for 120 days (1% of average gross for industrial wage in 1947), a funeral allowance and free medical, hospital, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM. On 31 October 1947, the Italian Parliament approved a bill that reorganised the health insurance system for service employees (e.g. banking and commerce), with a daily sickness indemnity equal to 50% of earnings for a maximum of 180 days a year, a flat-rate maternity payment, funeral allowance, and free hospital, medical, and pharmaceutical assistance through INAM.

On 28 February 1949, De Gasperi launched a seven-year plan for social housing to increase the stock of economic housing by means of construction or purchase of economic accommodation. The law also established a special housing fund (INA-Casa) within the National Institute for Insurance (Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, or INA). Moreover, on 29 July 1947 the government established a Fund For Social Solidarity within INPS in order to pay graduated supplementary allowances to all pensions, compensating for inflation.
A law of 29 April 1949 introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labour policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed was set up with the task of monitoring the state of the labour market and the conditions of the unemployed, while regulations concerning the replacement of the unemployed into the labour market (&quot;collocamento&quot;) were introduced. Provincial offices for Labour and Full Employment were also established, with local sections, which organized waiting lists, training courses, and the allocation of available jobs, amongst other services. Unemployment indemnity was increased to Lit. 200 per day (approximately 17% of the average gross industrial wage for 1949) and its duration was extended from 120 to 180 days. Unemployment insurance was extended to agricultural workers, and a special unemployment benefit (&quot;sussidio straordinario di disoccupazione&quot;) was introduced, paid under exceptional circumstances; flat-rate benefit with ad hoc determined level for 90 to 180 days. Vocational training and professional qualification programmes for the unemployed were also introduced, along with a Fund for Professional Training of Workers.
On 29 April 1949, a law was approved that introduced new provisions for unemployment insurance and labour policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed was established with the task of monitoring the state of the labour market and the conditions of the unemployed.

On 23 March 1948, the National Institute for Assistance of the Orphans of Italian Workers and the National Institute for Italian Pensioners were established, providing benefits and services for needy pensioners. On 26 August 1950, the government introduced various regulations covering maternity insurance for all female employees.

In 1952, the party overwhelmingly endorsed his authority over the government and over the party. However, it was also the start of his decline. He came under increasing criticism from the emerging left wing in the party. Their main accusations were that he was too cautious in social and economic reform, that he stifled debate and that he subordinated the party to the interests of government.

===1953 general election and decline===
The 1953 general election was characterised by changes in the electoral law. Even if the general structure remained uncorrupted, the government introduced a superbonus of two-thirds of seats in the House for the coalition which would obtain at-large the absolute majority of votes. The change was strongly opposed by the opposition parties as well as DC&#x27;s smaller coalition partners, who had no realistic chance of success under this system. The new law was called the &quot;Scam Law&quot; by its detractors, including some dissidents of minor government parties who founded special opposition groups to deny the artificial landslide to Christian Democracy.

The Holy See actively supported Christian Democracy, declaring that it would be a mortal sin for a Catholic to vote for the PCI and excommunicating all its supporters. In practice, however, many Communists remained religious: Emilia was known to be an area where people were both religious and communists. Giovannino Guareschi wrote his novels about Don Camillo describing a village, Brescello, whose inhabitants are at the same time loyal to priest Camillo and Communist mayor Peppone, who are fierce rivals.

The campaign of the opposition to the &quot;Scam Law&quot; achieved its goal. The government coalition (DC, PSDI, PLI, PRI, South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party and Sardinian Action Party) won 49.9% of the national vote, just a few thousand votes from the threshold for a supermajority, resulting in an ordinary proportional distribution of the seats. Minor dissident parties determined the final result, especially the short-lived National Democratic Alliance. The leading party Christian Democracy did not repeat the extraordinary result of five years earlier, which had been obtained under special conditions linked to the Cold War, and lost a lot of votes to the right, including resurgent fascist politicians, particularly in Southern Italy.
Technically, the government won the election, winning a clear working majority of seats in both houses. However, frustration with the failure to win a supermajority caused significant tensions in the leading coalition. De Gasperi was forced to resign by the Parliament on 2 August: he consequently retired and died twelve months later. The legislature continued with weak governments, with minor parties refusing institutional responsibilities. Giuseppe Pella rose to power, but fell after only five months, following heated disputes about the status of the Free Territory of Trieste which Pella was claiming. Amintore Fanfani&#x27;s succeeding first ministry failed to receive a vote of confidence in Parliament, whilst Mario Scelba and Antonio Segni followed with more traditional centrist coalitions supported by Social Democrats and Liberals: under the administration of Scelba, the problem of Trieste was settled by ceding Koper/Capodistria to Yugoslavia. The parliamentary term was seen out by the minority government chaired by Adone Zoli, finishing a legislature which hugely weakened the office of the Prime Minister, held by six different leaders.

In 1954, De Gasperi also had to give up the leadership of the party, when Amintore Fanfani was appointed new Secretary of the Christian Democracy in June.

==Death and legacy==

On 19 August 1954, De Gasperi died in Sella di Valsugana, in his beloved Trentino. It is said that he had to be given a State funeral as he had died with almost no means of his own. He is buried in the , a basilica in Rome. The process for his beatification was opened in 1993.

&quot;De Gasperi was against exacerbating conflict&quot;, according to his former secretary and former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. &quot;He taught us to search for compromise, to mediate.&quot;

He is considered one of the founding fathers of the European Union. From the very beginning of European integration, De Gasperi, Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer met regularly. He helped to organize the Council of Europe and supported the Schuman Declaration, which in 1951 led to the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community – a forerunner in the process of European integration. In 1954 he was elected president of the forerunner of the European Parliament, the Community&#x27;s Common Assembly. Although eventually transformed into the current project of the European Union, De Gasperi helped to develop the idea of a common European defence policy. In 1952, he received the Karlspreis (International Charlemagne Prize of the City of Aachen), an award by the German city of Aachen to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace. The 1954–1955 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.

In 2024, a 515-page revisionist account of De Gasperi by Mark Gilbert, &quot;Italy Reborn; from Fascism to Democracy&quot;, was published by Allen Lane.

==Personal life==
On 14 June 1922, De Gasperi married Francesca Romani (30 August 1894 – 20 August 1998) and had four daughters, Maria Romana, Lucia, Cecilia and Paola.

In Florestano Vancini&#x27;s film &quot;The Assassination of Matteotti&quot; (1973), De Gasperi is played by Ezio Marano.

He has also written and directed episodes for some these television shows, and directed a few films, such as &quot;Perfect Victims&quot; (1988) and &quot;Blind Vision&quot; (1991). He was also part of the musical duo Shuky &amp; Aviva (alternatively Shuki &amp; Aviva), with his partner Aviva Paz.

==Life and career==
===Beginnings===
Levy was born in Jaffa, British Mandate of Palestine. His father was an Ashkenazi Jew originally from Russia, and his mother of Sephardi Jewish origin.

His career began as a singer and music performer, playing in various clubs around Tel Aviv. He also appeared in the musical &quot;Hair.&quot;

===Shuky &amp; Aviva===
During the 1970s, Levy performed in France and Germany with Aviva Paz as the duo &quot;Shuki &amp; Aviva&quot; or &quot;Shuky and Aviva&quot;. His duo partner was also born in Israel, and four years older than him. Together they scored a hit single throughout Europe called &quot;Signorina - Concertina&quot; which sold two million copies. He also appeared with her on several other releases and music videos. In 1975, Shuki &amp; Aviva sung &quot;You and Me and Two Dreams&quot;, which competed as one of the possible German entries during the preliminary rounds of the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest. Levy later composed &quot;Halayla&quot;, the Israeli entry to the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest.

===Saban Entertainment===
While living in Paris, he met businessman and musician Haim Saban, with the two becoming friends and collaborators. In an interview, Levy recalled &quot;Haim said, &#x27;We&#x27;ll be co-composer. You do the composing, I&#x27;ll do the deals.&#x27; I figured, &#x27;Great. Brothers.&#x27; That was the last business conversation we had for many years. We were partners. We never had a written agreement. It was all verbal.&quot; They eventually moved to Los Angeles and founded Saban Entertainment, a production company responsible for animated shows and Japanese adaptions, such as &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. The company was sold to The Walt Disney Company by the end of 2001.

During the 1980s and 1990s, he composed television music; according to BMI&#x27;s music publishing database, he has written a combined total of 4,210 themes, background scores and songs. In a 1998 investigation by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, it was alleged that many of these compositions were ghostwritten by other composers, in order for Levy and Haim Saban to gain control of all publishing rights and music royalty revenue.

===Post-Saban Entertainment projects===
The first project Levy worked on following the dissolution of Saban Entertainment was &quot;Itty Bitty HeartBeats&quot;, a 2003 animated children&#x27;s DVD. In 2009, he also directed and composed music for the live action film &quot;Aussie and Ted&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;. The film was co-written with his wife Tori Avey, and featured his daughter Jordan in one of the roles.

===Personal life===
In 1977, Levy was married to Miss USA 1970 and actress Deborah Shelton (&quot;Dallas&quot;), with whom he has a daughter. Shelton went on to appear in the 1982 horror film &quot;Blood Tide&quot;, which was one of the first film and television projects Levy composed for. He was also in a relationship with television actress Sarah Brown (&quot;General Hospital&quot;), with whom he has a second daughter. When they started dating in 1994, Brown was only 19 years old and 27 years younger than Levy. At that point, he was also secretly engaged to another actress named Shell Danielson, and still married to Shelton. Levy remained in a secret relationship with Danielson even after Brown moved in with him, and also remained married to Shelton until early 2000, nearly two years after Brown&#x27;s daughter was born. Brown and Levy split in 2000, with Brown accusing him of spying on her over the next few years. Levy is currently married to food blogger Tori Avey, who he met in the early 2000s. Levy has owned properties in both California and Miami.

<text>Latex allergy is a medical term encompassing a range of allergic reactions to the proteins present in natural rubber latex. It generally develops after repeated exposure to products containing natural rubber latex. When latex-containing medical devices or supplies come in contact with mucous membranes, the membranes may absorb latex proteins. In some susceptible people, the immune system produces antibodies that react immunologically with these antigenic proteins. Many items contain or are made from natural rubber, including shoe soles, pen grips, hot water bottles, elastic bands, rubber gloves, condoms, baby-bottle nipples, and balloons; consequently, there are many possible routes of exposure that may trigger a reaction. People with latex allergies may also have or develop allergic reactions to some fruits, such as bananas.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Allergic reactions to latex range from Type I hypersensitivity, the most serious form of reaction, to Type IV hypersensitivity. Rate of onset is directly proportional to the degree of allergy: Type I responses will begin showing symptoms within minutes of exposure to latex, while Type IV responses may take hours or days to appear.

Most commonly, latex allergy presents with hives at the point of contact, followed by rhinitis. The most common physiological reaction to latex exposure is dermatitis at the point of contact, which gives way to soreness, itching, and redness. Angioedema is also a common response to oral, vaginal, or rectal contact.

Symptoms of more severe hypersensitivity include both local and generalized hives; feelings of faintness or impending doom; angioedema; nausea and vomiting; abdominal cramps; rhinitis; bronchospasm; and anaphylaxis. Type IV responses typically include erythema, blistering (forming vesicles and papules), itching, and crusting at the point of contact. This irritant contact dermatitis is considered a nonimmune reaction to latex. The degree of reaction is directly proportional to the duration of exposure, as well as skin temperature.

Among those with a latex allergy, 40% will experience irritant contact dermatitis; 33.1% will experience a Type I allergic reaction; 20.4% will experience Type IV allergic contact dermatitis; and 6.5% will experience both Type I and Type IV symptoms.

== Causes ==

=== Occupational exposure ===

The prevalence of latex allergy is greater in certain populations with increased exposure and has historically been studied in this context. Specifically, regular and prolonged occupational exposure to latex is a known risk factor for the development of an allergy. Healthcare workers, dental specialists, food service workers, cosmetologists, rubber industry workers, law enforcement personnel, and painters are among some of the highest-risk occupations. It is estimated that the worldwide prevalence of latex allergy in healthcare workers is 9.7%-12.4%.

Latex allergy became a more common problem in healthcare in the 1980s and 1990s with the adoption of universal precautions, which involved frequent use of latex gloves, with the emergence of HIV/AIDs. The rates of latex allergy dropped to 4-7% in the healthcare setting with the widespread introduction of non-powdered latex gloves. On December 19, 2016, the FDA officially banned the use of powdered gloves in the US healthcare setting, citing the unnecessary burden of potential injury due to allergy. General latex avoidance protocols have been put in to place in healthcare settings in the US and many other developed countries with the switch to nitrile gloves. However, latex exposure in healthcare settings in developing countries from latex gloves or latex components of medical devices such as urinary catheters, dialysis ports, or vial stoppers, remains a significant concern.

=== Alternative latex exposure ===
While most reported allergic reactions to latex have occurred in medical settings, non-healthcare workers show similar levels of latex antibodies, suggesting that they are sensitized to natural rubber latex through other sources, both inside the home and as medical patients. In particular, individuals with chronic health concerns that lead to repeated surgeries or catheterizations thus experience greater exposure to latex allergens and may develop an allergy. Outside of hospital environments, latex allergy may develop in amateur and professional athletes whose sports equipment includes natural rubber, such as swimsuits or running shoes. Rubber basketballs, in particular, may lead to contact dermatitis on the hands and fingertips. The sensitization to latex in athletes may be accelerated by the use of topical analgesics and other agents that diminish the skin barrier and increase contact. It has also been hypothesized that young children may develop a latex allergy due to exposure in the home and school environment from objects such as rubber balloons, boots, gloves, and toys.

=== Spina bifida ===
People with spina bifida often have latex allergies. Up to 68% of children with this condition will have a reaction to latex. The mechanism of this association between spina bifida and latex allergy is not clearly defined. However, spina bifida patients may become sensitized to latex early in life as they often require frequent surgeries and medical procedures that involve exposure to latex products. 

=== Related allergies ===
People who have latex allergy also may have or develop an allergic response to some plants and/or products of these plants (such as fruits). This is known as &quot;latex-fruit syndrome&quot;. Fruits (and seeds) involved in this syndrome include banana, avocado, chestnut, kiwifruit, mango, passionfruit, fig, strawberry, papaya, apple, melon, celery, potato, tomato, carrot, and soy. The proteins in these fruits are similar to latex proteins.
Hevein-like protein domains are a possible cause for allergen cross-reactivity between latex and banana or fruits in general.

Natural rubber latex contains several conformational epitopes located on several enzymes such as &quot;Hev b 1&quot;, &quot;Hev b 2&quot;, &quot;Hev b 4&quot;, &quot;Hev b 5&quot; and &quot;Hev b 6.02&quot;.

FITkit is a latex allergen testing method for quantification of the major natural rubber latex specific allergens: Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 5, and Hev b 6.02.

==Prevention==
The most effective form of primary prevention towards latex sensitization is limiting or completely avoiding contact with latex, particularly among children with risk factors such as spina bifida. The limitation of powdered latex glove use in hospital settings has also proven an effective primary prevention strategy among adult health care workers, and as secondary prevention for sensitized individuals.

==Epidemiology==
Latex allergy is uncommon in the general population, at least compared to high-risk groups such as hospital workers and spina bifida patients. Estimates suggest a worldwide prevalence of around 4.3% among the general population. Between 1% and 6% of the general population in the United States has latex allergy; assays of antibody levels in the blood suggest that 2.7 million to 16 million Americans are affected by some form of latex sensitivity. Females are approximately three times as likely as males to have latex allergies. Possible risk factors for the female population include increased employment in high-risk occupations and enhanced histamine release caused by female hormones.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to latex include:
*Synthetic rubbers (such as elastane, neoprene, nitrile) and artificially synthesized polyisoprene latex, which do not contain the proteins from the &quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; tree.
*Products made from guayule natural rubber emulsions, which also do not contain the proteins from the &quot;Hevea&quot; rubber tree, and do not cause allergy in persons sensitized to &quot;Hevea&quot; proteins.
*Alternative materials like Vytex Natural Rubber Latex which reduce exposure to latex allergens while otherwise retaining the properties of natural rubber; these are made using chemical treatment to reduce the amount of antigenic proteins in &quot;Hevea&quot; latex.
*Polyurethane. 
The first polyurethane condoms, designed for people with latex allergies, were produced in 1994.

Some people are so sensitive that they may still have a reaction to replacement products made from alternative materials. This can occur when the alternative products are manufactured in the same facility as latex-containing products, leaving trace quantities of natural rubber latex on the non-latex products.

<text>The kampilan (Baybayin: ) is a type of single-edged sword, traditionally used by various ethnic groups in the Philippine archipelago. It has a distinct profile, with the tapered blade being much broader and thinner at the point than at its base, sometimes with a protruding spikelet along the flat side of the tip. The design of the pommel varies between ethnic groups, but it usually depicts either a &quot;buaya&quot; (crocodile), a &quot;bakunawa&quot; (sea serpent), a &quot;kalaw&quot; (hornbill), or a &quot;kakatua&quot; (cockatoo)..

This weapon was featured in the American bladesmithing competition, &quot;Forged in Fire&quot;, in season 4 episode 16.

==Names==
&quot;Kampilan&quot; is the term most commonly used for the sword in the Tagalog, Ilocano and Visayan languages. It simply means &quot;sword&quot;. It is known by other names in other ethnic groups in the Philippines including Kapampangan talibong or talibon (not to be confused with the Visayan talibon); Maranao kifing; Iranun parang kampilan; and Tboli tok and kafilan.

==History==
Kampilan are mentioned in ancient Filipino epics, including the Hiligaynon &quot;Hinilawod&quot; from the Visayas; the Ilocano &quot;Biag ni Lam-Ang&quot; from Luzon; and the Maranao &quot;Darangen&quot; of Mindanao. The kampilan also plays a central part in the Maranao and Maguindanao traditional war dance of Sagayan, which depicts a scene from the &quot;Darangen.&quot;

Unlike other common precolonial Filipino &quot;bolo&quot; weapons which were based on agricultural implements, the kampilan is specifically made for warfare, used either in small skirmishes or large-scale encounters. According to Philippine historical documents, the kampílan was widely used by chieftains and warriors for battle and as a headhunting sword. The most famous probable use of kampilan in warfare was in the Battle of Mactan, where Antonio Pigafetta described Ferdinand Magellan being wounded on the left leg by a warrior bearing &quot;a large cutlass, which resembles a scimitar, only being larger.&quot; In traditional societies of the Tagalog people, it is also used as a form of religious adornment in a dambana. Kampilan swords only survive into modern times among the Moro and the Lumad people, due to the longer period that they avoided Spanish colonization.

== Physical description ==

Among Filipino swords, the most distinguishing characteristic of the kampilan is its huge size. At about 36 to 40 inches (90 to 100 cm) long, it is much larger than other Filipino swords, and is thought to be the longest, though smaller versions (sometimes called the &quot;kampilan bolo&quot;) exist. A notable exception would be the &quot;panabas&quot;, another Philippine longsword, of which unusually large examples used for ceremonial execution purposes could measure up to four feet in length. The blade is narrow near the hilt and it gradually swells in width into an almost trapezoidal profile at the end. The blades are often laminated with various styles of tip. Kampílan blades often have holes near the tip that are sometimes filled with brass. Rarer still are specimens that have tips exhibiting a &quot;kris&quot;-like fretwork, while others have engravings down the entire blade. Although the kampílan can be used with one hand, it is primarily a two-handed sword.

===Blade===
The laminated steel blade of the kampílan is single-edged, and made from Damascus steel pattern welding process and is easily identified by its tapered profile, narrowest near the hilt and gently widening until its truncated point. The blade&#x27;s spikelet has led to the description of the kampílan in some documents as &quot;dual-tipped&quot; or &quot;double-tipped&quot;.

===Sheath or scabbard===
The scabbard is usually made of cheap wood and is bound with simple rattan or fibre lashings. When the sword needs to be used immediately, the sword bearer will simply strike with the sheathed sword and the blade will cut through the lashings, thereby effecting a quick, tactical strike without the need to unsheathe the sword.

Scabbards are unadorned and are often disposable when going into battle. Some scabbards were also made of bamboo or were made with a handle that allowed half of the scabbard to serve as a small shield.

===Hilt===
The hilt is quite long in order to counterbalance the weight and length of the blade and is made of hardwood. As with the blade, the design of the hilt&#x27;s profile is relatively consistent from blade to blade. The hilt is sometimes wrapped with rattan to improve the grip. At times the hilt was bound to the hand by a talismanic piece of cloth to prevent slippage. Sometimes a chain mail covering was attached to prevent the hand from injury. Almost all kampílan originally had large metal staples protruding from the cross guard above the grip.

The complete &quot;tang&quot; of the kampílan disappears into a crossguard, which is often decoratively carved with geometric or flowing patterns. The guard prevents the enemy&#x27;s weapon from sliding all the way down the blade onto bearer&#x27;s hand and also prevents the bearer&#x27;s hand from sliding onto the blade while thrusting.
The most distinctive design element of the hilt is the pommel. The design of the pommel varies between ethnic groups of the Philippines. In the ethnic groups of Visayas and Luzon, the pommel usually depicts a &quot;bakunawa&quot; (or &quot;naga&quot;), a horned dragon-like mythological creature. Among the Muslim Moro people, the pommel usually depicts either a &quot;kalaw&quot; (hornbill) or a &quot;kakatua&quot; (cockatoo). Other animals depicted in kampilan pommels include monitor lizards and crocodiles. Among the Lumad people of the interiors of Mindanao, kampilan pommels do not typically depict animals, but is instead a simple curving shape that flares out at the end.

Kampilan hilts are typically made from hardwood, but expensive examples that belonged to &quot;datu&quot; are covered in silver sheet or are entirely manufactured out of expensive materials such as horn or bone. Like the blade, they may possess small holes at the tips and edges which can have attachments like bells, metal chains, or animal or human hair tassels. Some kampilan hilts, especially among the Lumad, can also be made entirely of brass.

==Similar swords==
Similar weapons to the kampilan in the Philippines include the Bangkung, Laring, Itak, Pirah, and the Banyal. Other similar weapons to the Kampilan outside of the Philippines include the Dayak Mandau of Borneo; the Minahasan santi of northern Sulawesi; and the Sangirese Bara Sangihe of the Sangihe Islands. In Brunei, the officers who bear the royal regalia of the Sultan of Brunei such as the &quot;Panglima Asgar&quot; (Soldier General) who carry the royal weapons of &quot;kalasak&quot; and kampilan, where as the &quot;Panglima Diraja (Royal commander)&quot; carry the &quot;Pemuras&quot; and &quot;Karga&quot;.

==Historical accounts==

==Modern day ceremonial uses==

The No. 1 graduating cadet of the Philippine National Police Academy will receive the Presidential Kampilan as a recognition of his achievement for excelling in all aspects of the 4-year cadetship training, the No. 2 graduate will also receive the Vice Presidential Kampilan as recognition for the 2nd best performing cadet of the graduating batch.

<text>The Museum of History &amp; Industry (MOHAI) is a history museum in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the largest private heritage organization in Washington state, maintaining a collection of nearly four million artifacts, photographs, and archival materials primarily focusing on Seattle and the greater Puget Sound region. A portion of this collection (roughly 2% at any given time) is on display in the museum&#x27;s galleries at the historic Naval Reserve Armory in Lake Union Park.

The museum&#x27;s keynote exhibits include: Boeing&#x27;s first commercial plane, the 1919 Boeing B-1; the Petticoat Flag, a U.S. flag sewn by women during the 1856 Battle of Seattle; and the Rainier Brewing Company&#x27;s 12-foot tall neon &quot;R&quot; sign. In addition to both permanent and temporary exhibits, MOHAI administers ongoing youth and adult programming, and regularly hosts public events in partnership with other community organizations, particularly within the South Lake Union neighborhood. MOHAI is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and is a Smithsonian affiliate museum.

==History==
In 1911, Morgan and Emily Carkeek hosted the first annual Founder&#x27;s Day party at their home, which was an invitation-only event where guests dressed in historic costumes and brought artifacts and documents related to early Seattle. An outcome of these parties was the establishment of the Seattle Historical Society in 1914, the membership of which was limited to white settlers and their descendants.

The Seattle Historical Society lacked a building to house the museum. Several attempts to find a permanent location were abandoned because of challenging financial circumstances, especially during the Depression, and the fact that the original society members were aging and new members were not joining. The collection continued to grow, however. In 1945, Boeing offered $50,000 towards an aviation wing, and over the next five years, the Society procured a site in Montlake. During this time, the Society became a more public and civic-minded institution, opening up the Founder&#x27;s Day event to community and service organizations. The new museum opened in 1952.

Over the last 50 years, management practices of the museum and collections, membership, and the relationship to its immediate surroundings, have been problematic. Changes in the 1980s included developing new exhibits and reaching out to underrepresented communities, which were a shock to older staff and board members. During the 1990s the museum gradually recovered from these internal challenges, as well as financial ones, and began expanding educational and community outreach programs.

The impending reconstruction of State Route 520 and the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge forced MOHAI to move from the Montlake site. After exploring options to move near the Washington State Convention Center, MOHAI and the City of Seattle agreed to move MOHAI to the Naval Reserve Armory in what was soon to be Lake Union Park. At that time, the building was being managed by the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department and was in need of significant repairs to be usable as a public museum space. Through a $90 million capital campaign, MOHAI did a full historic restoration of the facility, uncovering both the original ceiling and floor and conducting massive safety, accessibility, and systems upgrades. The project also included centralizing MOHAI&#x27;s library and collections departments in a warehouse in the Georgetown neighborhood. In June 2012 the museum closed its Montlake location. Six months later, on December 29, 2012, the museum held a public grand opening for its new home in South Lake Union.

==Galleries==

===True Northwest: The Seattle Journey===

MOHAI&#x27;s core exhibit rings most of the building&#x27;s second floor and provides a chronological history of Seattle and its environs. The exhibit winds through a series of 22 different sections that each focus on a distinct event or era in Seattle history ranging from pre-Pioneer settlements up to the modern day. MOHAI Creative Director Ann Farrington, who previously worked on Seattle&#x27;s Experience Music Project and the National Holocaust Museum, has said that it is, &quot;not a timeline, but a series of stories strung like pearls&quot; in order to reveal how Seattle&#x27;s past, present, and future are interconnected. Along with numerous artifacts and photographs, the exhibit incorporates a significant amount of interactive media that allow visitors to touch screens or play games that explore different parts of Seattle history and culture. The core exhibit also includes the Great Fire Theatre, a &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan-style opera&quot; that involves artifacts from the 1889 Great Seattle Fire singing the story of the event over a film of historic images, and the Joshua Green Foundation Theater which plays a 7-minute film about Seattle culture on two large screens.

===Faye G. Allen Grand Atrium===

The first floor of the museum is an expansive open room named the Faye G. Allen Grand Atrium. Both the original floor and ceiling of the Naval Reserve Building are visible from the Grand Atrium. Hanging in the center of the space is the 1919 Boeing B-1, the first commercial plane built by Bill Boeing. The plane is displayed to illustrate a typical flight path onto Lake Union, where the plane took off and landed during its tenure. On the south end of the Grand Atrium is a three-story tall-grid filled with Seattle cultural icons, including the neon Rainier &quot;R&quot; sign, a clam costume from Seattle seafood chain Ivar&#x27;s, and a stuffed cougar donated by Eddie Bauer, founder of the namesake clothing store. The north end of the Grand Atrium features a 64-foot-tall sculpture called &quot;Wawona&quot; by local artist John Grade. Wood and other materials for the sculpture were salvaged from the 1897 schooner Wawona, which was dismantled in 2009 due to a lack of funding for restoration.

===Walker Special Exhibits Gallery===
The Walker Gallery is MOHAI&#x27;s main space for displaying temporary and traveling exhibits. It takes up the entire southern side of the museum&#x27;s second floor. When the museum initially opened at Lake Union Park, the Walker Gallery showcased an exhibit about Seattle&#x27;s relationship with film called &quot;Celluloid Seattle: A City at the Movies.&quot; In 2015, the Walker Gallery hosted &quot;American Spirits: The Rise &amp; Fall of Prohibition&quot; travelling from the National Constitution Center.

===Linda and Ted Johnson Family Community Gallery===
Another temporary gallery that occupies the third floor space of the museum. Much smaller than the Walker Gallery, the space is designed &quot;to promote community ownership and stewardship of MOHAI&quot; by showcasing collaborative projects with community partners. The first exhibit in the gallery was a partnership with leading Seattle arts group Arts Corps, that worked with Seattle high school students to produce poetry and spoken word related to photos from MOHAI&#x27;s historic photographic collection.

===McCurdy Family Maritime Gallery===
On the top floor of the museum is a small gallery dedicated to Seattle&#x27;s maritime history. The space was originally designed as a replica of a ship&#x27;s bridge in order to train naval recruits during World War II and features a set of south facing windows overlooking Lake Union. One of the most popular artifacts in the gallery is a working World War II-era TANG periscope from a naval submarine which offers a 360-degree view of Lake Union and downtown Seattle. The gallery is curated by the Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society which has maintained a close partnership with MOHAI since the early 1950s.

===Bezos Center for Innovation===
The museum opened a major museum addition on October 11, 2013 called the &quot;Bezos Center for Innovation&quot;. The project is funded by a $10 million gift from Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. The project was designed by Seattle-based Olson Kundig Architects and occupies a portion of the museum&#x27;s Grand Atrium.

<doc id="722374" wikidata="Q5220094" url="?curid=722374" title="Danny Almonte">
<text>Danny Almonte Rojas (born April 7, 1987) is a Dominican-American former baseball player who is currently an assistant baseball coach at Cardinal Hayes High School in New York City. Born in Moca in the Dominican Republic, Almonte was a Little League pitcher who threw up to . Considered a phenomenon as he led his Bronx team to a third-place finish in the 2001 Little League World Series, Almonte was revealed to have actually been two years too old to play Little League baseball. Although there were many allegations during the 2001 Series, the truth was not revealed until weeks later.

==Little League Baseball==
In 2000, Danny Almonte moved to The Bronx, New York City, where he began playing Little League Baseball. His father, Felipe, who had moved to the U.S. six years earlier, had begun a youth baseball league in Moca that still bears his name.

===2001 Little League World Series===

Almonte threw a no-hitter in the 2001 Mid-Atlantic Regional finals against State College, Pennsylvania, sending his team to the Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. With his high leg kick and a fastball that reached a top speed of —the equivalent, for that distance, of a major-league fastball)—the Danny soon became a sensation. His imposing frame won him the nickname &quot;Little Unit,&quot; a nod to Randy Johnson, nicknamed &quot;Big Unit&quot;. 

In a round-robin game four days later, Almonte threw the first perfect game in the Little League World Series since 1979, against the team from Apopka, Florida. However, his team was defeated by the same Florida team in the U.S. championship game—Almonte could not pitch in the championship game under Little League rules, as he had pitched a complete game the day before.

Almonte completed the tournament with 62 strikeouts (out of 72 batters faced), giving up only three hits in three starts, and only one unearned run. His team, nicknamed &quot;the Baby Bombers&quot; because they played in the shadow of Yankee Stadium, was the feel-good story of the tournament, and were honored before a New York Yankees game shortly after the Series. They also received the key to the city from Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

===Concerns about age===
Almonte&#x27;s imposing appearance and command on the mound, as well as the velocity of his fastball, led to rumors that he was older than 12 years old, the age limit for Little League Baseball. A team from Staten Island hired a private investigator to look into the ages of the entire team. A similar investigation was conducted by a team from Pequannock Township, New Jersey. Neither turned up any evidence that the players were too old. Rolando Paulino, the league president, adamantly insisted that Almonte had been born on April 7, 1989. Paulino was initially backed by Little League and Dominican officials, who said the Baby Bombers had followed all proper procedures regarding age verification. Officials at Little League headquarters even took the unusual step of checking each of the player documents due to the rumors surrounding the team. Little League officials had increased scrutiny of player eligibility after the 1992 Series, in which the champions from Zamboanga City in the Philippines were stripped of their title due to a large number of out-of-district and overage players.

Reporters from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; went to the civil records building in Moca two weeks after the end of the 2001 Series. They discovered a notation in the birth ledger showing that in 1994, Felipe Almonte had registered his son&#x27;s birth date as April 7, 1987, at Dr. Toribio Bencosme Hospital—which would have made him 14 years old at the time of the 2001 Series. It was common for Dominican parents to wait years before registering the birth of a child. Their report, posted on the magazine&#x27;s website just before being published, triggered a full investigation by Little League, even as Almonte and his teammates were being feted in the Bronx. Almonte&#x27;s mother, Sonia Rojas Breton, owned a handwritten birth certificate saying that he had been born at home in Jamao with the help of a midwife in 1989. She had registered Danny&#x27;s 1989 birth date in 2000.

Both of Almonte&#x27;s parents, though separated, insisted their son was born in 1989, condemning the other documents as false. Felipe Almonte appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; at the time of the investigation, proclaiming his son&#x27;s innocence.

===Age disclosure===
As part of Dominican officials&#x27; investigation, Victor Romero, head of the national public records office, interviewed the witnesses whose signatures appeared on the 1989 birth certificate. They both denied knowing Danny&#x27;s parents, let alone signing the certificate. On August 31, Romero announced that Danny had been born in 1987.

As a result, Danny Almonte was retroactively declared ineligible, and the Baby Bombers had to forfeit all their wins in tournament play. All of their records were removed from the books, and the team was required to demonstrate compliance with all regulations before entering the 2002 tournament. Felipe was banned from Little League competition for life. Paulino was also banned, since Little League rules make the league president responsible for player eligibility. Dominican prosecutors filed criminal charges against Felipe for falsifying a birth certificate. Danny, who did not speak English at the time, apparently knew nothing about the falsified documents and was cleared of wrongdoing. Little League president Stephen Keener said that Danny and his teammates had been &quot;used ... in a most contemptible and despicable way&quot; and that &quot;millions of Little Leaguers around the world were deceived.&quot; ESPN&#x27;s Jim Caple called Felipe &quot;the worst stereotype of the Little League parent sprung to life.&quot; Danny&#x27;s godmother later begged forgiveness, saying that &quot;we had to commit this little fraud&quot; to give Danny a chance to compete in a tournament as significant as the Little League World Series.

About the same time, New York City child welfare officials discovered that Danny had not been enrolled in school for the 2000–01 year—which would be a violation of state law, and grounds for placing him in foster care. Danny&#x27;s registration listed him as attending Public School 70 in the Bronx. However, Dominican school officials said they had records that Danny had actually attended school in the Dominican Republic until June 15. This would have made him ineligible for the Little League World Series even if he had actually been 12 years old. Little League rules require a player to have appeared in at least half of his team&#x27;s games by June 15 in order to be eligible for the all-star team that competes in the tournament. Danny then enrolled at Public School 52 in the Bronx in September.

==Subsequent baseball involvement==
After his father&#x27;s visa expired, Danny Almonte remained in New York under the guardianship of Rolando Paulino. He played, along with four of his former teammates, in the 2004 Public Schools Athletic League championship. In early 2005, Almonte moved to the Miami area, where he did not play baseball due to residency requirements. The following year he returned to New York, where he pitched for James Monroe High School in the Bronx.

While in the National Amateur Baseball Federation (NABF) wood-bat summer league, he played for Youth Service.

Almonte attended a Major League Baseball (MLB) tryout in October 2006. There had been some reports that Almonte would be selected in the 2006 MLB draft, but that did not happen. After the draft, he said he would play baseball for New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs, New Mexico. The team made it to the National Junior College championship game in 2007. Later that year, Almonte joined the Southern Illinois Miners of the Frontier League, an independent minor-league circuit—and thus forfeited his NCAA collegiate eligibility. He pitched his first game on May 27, 2007, against the Evansville Otters. The Miners lost, 3–2. He was released on June 30, 2007. Almonte&#x27;s record was 0–1, with a 5.29 earned run average (ERA) in six appearances. By at least one account, his poor performance was due to his being out of shape at the time.

In fall 2007, Almonte enrolled as a freshman in Western Oklahoma State College, a community college in Altus, Oklahoma, where he pitched and played right field for the Pioneers. Almonte and the Pioneers were ranked fourth in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Division 2 poll and advanced to the NJCAA D-2 World Series. Almonte finished as one of the top hitters in junior-college baseball, hitting for a .497 batting average with 14 home runs and going 7–1 with one save as a pitcher. In his second year at the school, Almonte had a .472 batting average with 18 home runs, and had a pitching record of 9–0. He was again not selected in the MLB draft.

Forced to give up pitching due to a sore arm, Almonte played semi-pro baseball in the summer of 2009 as an outfielder. As of 2010, Almonte had returned to the Bronx, where he was serving as a volunteer assistant coach for his high school alma mater&#x27;s baseball team. Almonte indicated an intent to return to semi-pro baseball that summer, after the end of the school year, but said that he no longer held expectations of some day playing in MLB.

==Personal life==
In May 2006, Almonte announced he was married to 30-year-old Rosy Perdomo. The wedding took place in 2005, when Almonte was 18. In 2010, Almonte was reportedly no longer with his wife, though he would not discuss details of the relationship.

==In popular culture==
The episode &quot;Foul Play&quot; of the legal drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; was inspired by Almonte&#x27;s story.

Almonte was mentioned in the 17th episode of season 27 of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during Weekend Update.

<doc id="722375" wikidata="Q5717411" url="?curid=722375" title="Henry Art Gallery">
<text>The Henry Art Gallery (&quot;The Henry&quot;) is a contemporary art museum located on the campus of the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington, United States. Located on the west edge of the university&#x27;s campus along 15th Avenue N.E. in the University District, it was founded in February, 1927, and was the first public art museum in the state of Washington. The original building was designed by Bebb and Gould. It was expanded in 1997 to , at which time the 154-seat auditorium was added. The addition/expansion was designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects.

==Founder==
The museum was named for Horace C. Henry, the local businessman who donated money for its founding, as well as a collection of paintings he had begun collecting in the 1890s after visiting the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Henry donated the collection he built with his late wife Susan of 178 works of art, along with funds for construction, and the Henry Art Gallery opened to the public on February 10, 1927. Some years prior, Henry had added gallery space to his own home on Capitol Hill, and from 1917 until the foundation of the Henry Gallery, he effectively operated a wing of his home as a free museum, open to the public 10 hours a week. In contrast to Charles and Emma Frye of Seattle&#x27;s Frye Art Museum, Henry made no effort to control the future of the museum he financed; indeed, he specifically disavowed any such intention.

==Exhibitions==
The Henry&#x27;s exhibition program is largely devoted to contemporary art and the history of photography. Major exhibitions have included Ann Hamilton: the common S E N S E (Oct 2014), Katinka Bock: A and I (2013), Maya Lin (2006), Lynn Hershman Leeson (2005–06), Doug Aitken (2005), James Turrell (2003), and group exhibitions such as &quot;W.O.W. - The Work of the Work&quot;, 2004–05, which explored contemporary art&#x27;s appeal to non-visual senses and the body of the viewer.

==Collection==
The Henry&#x27;s collection includes over 28,000 objects. The collection includes holdings in photography, both historical and contemporary, due to the partial gift and purchase of the Joseph and Elaine Monsen collection. In 1982, the Henry inherited a sizable collection from the University of Washington&#x27;s former Costume and Textile Study Center. The Henry also holds a James Turrell Skyspace, &quot;&quot;, a site-specific immersive sculpture finished in 2003. Like the Seattle baseball stadium, the Skyspace has a retractable roof.

The Henry has made their collections available for research and general public interest by providing in-house and online public access though the Eleanor Henry Reed Collection Study Center and the online collections database. These resources allow students and the general public to explore collections for personal or professional research. Objects in the collection can be accessed on-site, by reservation only, through the Reed Collection Study Center or academic classes, adult study groups, and researchers.

== Brink Award==
The Brink Award was a biennial art award for an emerging artist from Washington, Oregon, or British Columbia worth $12,500. The award was established in 2008 and is administered by the Henry Art Gallery.

<doc id="722378" wikidata="Q189225" url="?curid=722378" title="Zealots">
<text>The Zealots were a political movement in 1st-century Second Temple Judaism that sought to incite the people of Judaea Province to rebel against the Roman Empire and expel it from the Holy Land by force of arms, most notably during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70). &quot;Zealotry&quot; was the term used by Josephus for a &quot;fourth sect&quot; or &quot;fourth Jewish philosophy&quot; during this period.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;zealot&quot;, the common translation of the Hebrew &quot;kanai&quot; (, frequently used in plural form, , &quot;kana&#x27;im&quot;), means one who is on behalf of God. The term derives from Greek (&quot;zelotes&quot;), &quot;emulator, zealous admirer or follower&quot;.

==History==

Josephus&#x27; &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; states that there were three main Jewish sects at this time, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. The Zealots were a &quot;fourth sect&quot;, founded by Judas of Galilee (also called Judas of Gamala) in 6 CE against the Census of Quirinius, shortly after the Roman Empire declared what had most recently been the tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus to be a Roman province. According to Josephus, they &quot;agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord.&quot; (18.1.6)

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on &quot;Zealots&quot;:
Others have also argued that the group was not so clearly marked out (before the first war of 66–70/3) as some have thought.

Simon the Zealot was listed among the apostles selected by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke and in the Acts of the Apostles. He is called Cananaean in Mark and Matthew (Matthew 10, , Mark 3,) Two of Judas of Galilee&#x27;s sons, Jacob and Simon, were involved in a revolt and were executed by Tiberius Alexander, the procurator of Iudaea province from 46 to 48.

The Zealots took a leading role in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), as they objected to Roman rule and violently sought to eradicate it by indiscriminately attacking Romans and Greeks. Another group, likely related, were the Sicarii, who raided Jewish settlements and killed Jews they considered apostates and collaborators, while also urging Jews to fight the Romans and other Jews for the cause. Josephus paints a very bleak picture of their activities as they instituted what he characterized as a murderous &quot;reign of terror&quot; prior to the Jewish Temple&#x27;s destruction. According to Josephus, the Zealots followed John of Gischala, who had fought the Romans in Galilee, escaped, came to Jerusalem, and then inspired the locals to a fanatical position that led to the Temple&#x27;s destruction. They succeeded in taking over Jerusalem and held it until 70, when the son of Roman Emperor Vespasian, Titus, retook the city and destroyed Herod&#x27;s Temple during the destruction of Jerusalem.

==In the Talmud==
In the Talmud, the Zealots are characterized as non-religious, that is not following the contemporary religious leadership. They are called the &quot;Biryonim&quot; (בריונים) meaning &quot;boorish&quot;, &quot;wild&quot;, or &quot;ruffians&quot;, and are condemned for their aggression, their unwillingness to compromise to save the survivors of besieged Jerusalem, and their blind militarism in opposition to the rabbis&#x27; desire to seek a peace treaty with Rome. However, according to one body of tradition, the rabbis initially supported the revolt until the Zealots instigated a civil war, at which point all hope of resisting the Romans was deemed impossible. 

The Zealots are further blamed for having contributed to the demise of Jerusalem and the Second Temple, and of ensuring Rome&#x27;s retribution and stranglehold on Judea. According to the Babylonian Talmud, Gittin:56b, the &quot;Biryonim&quot; destroyed decades&#x27; worth of food and firewood in besieged Jerusalem to force the Jews to fight the Romans out of desperation. This event precipitated the escape of Johanan ben Zakai and his meeting with Vespasian, which led to the foundation of the Academy of Jamnia and the composition of the Mishnah, ensuring the survival of rabbinical Judaism. 

==Sicarii==
The Sicarii were a splinter group of the Jewish Zealots who, in the decades preceding Jerusalem&#x27;s destruction in 70 CE, strongly opposed the Roman occupation of Judea and attempted to expel them and their sympathizers from the area. The Sicarii carried &quot;sicae&quot;, or small daggers, concealed in their cloaks. At public gatherings, they pulled out these daggers to attack Romans and alleged Roman sympathizers alike, blending into the crowd after the deed to escape detection.

According to historian Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, the Sicarii, originally based in Galilee, &quot;were fighting for a social revolution, while the Jerusalem Zealots placed less stress on the social aspect,&quot; and the Sicarii &quot;never attached themselves to one particular family and never proclaimed any of their leaders king&quot;. Both groups objected to the way the priestly families were running the Temple.

==Paul the Apostle==

While most English translations of the Bible render the Greek word &quot;zelotes&quot; in Acts 22:3 and Galatians 1:13-14 and Philippians 3:5-6 of the New Testament as the adjective &quot;&quot;, an article by Mark R. Fairchild takes it to mean a Zealot and suggests that Paul the Apostle may have been a Zealot, which might have been the driving force behind his persecution of the Christians (see the stoning of Saint Stephen) before his conversion to Christianity, and the incident at Antioch, even after his conversion. While Paul was not formally part of the Zealot movement—focused on violent resistance to Roman rule, his pre-conversion actions reflect a similar fervor for preserving Jewish purity and traditions. This zeal may also explain his later confrontations, such as the incident at Antioch, even after his conversion

In the two cited verses Paul literally declares himself as one who is &quot;loyal&quot; to God, or an &quot;ardent&quot; observer of the Law according to the Douay-Rheims of Acts 22:3, but the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Jewish Christianity is still debated. This does not necessarily prove Paul was revealing himself as a Zealot. The &quot;Modern King James Version&quot; of Jay P. Green renders it as &#x27;a zealous one&#x27;. Two modern translations (the Jewish New Testament and Alternate Literal Translation) render it as &#x27;a zealot&#x27;. The Unvarnished New Testament (1991) renders Galatians 1:14 as &quot;being an absolute zealot for the traditions&quot;.

<doc id="722379" wikidata="Q6345302" url="?curid=722379" title="Kaddish (poem)">
<text>&quot;Kaddish&quot; also known as &quot;Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg (1894–1956)&quot; is a poem by Beat writer Allen Ginsberg about his mother Naomi and her death on June 9, 1956. 

==Background==
Ginsberg began writing the poem in the Beat Hotel in Paris in December 1957, completing it in New York in 1959. It was the lead poem in the collection &quot;Kaddish and Other Poems&quot; (1961). It is considered one of Ginsberg&#x27;s finest poems, with some scholars holding that it is his best.

The &quot;Kaddish&quot; of the title refers to the mourner&#x27;s prayer or blessing in Judaism. This long poem was Ginsberg&#x27;s attempt to mourn his mother, Naomi, but also reflects his sense of loss at his estrangement from his born religion. The traditional Kaddish contains no references to death, but Ginsberg&#x27;s poem is riddled with thoughts and questionings of death.

==Stage version==
Ginsberg wrote a screenplay based on the poem. Robert Frank was to direct it, but money could not be raised for the project. In 1972, Robert Kalfin readapted the screenplay for the stage and produced it at the Chelsea Theater Center in the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The play explored Naomi Ginsberg&#x27;s schizophrenic collapse and made use of innovative video for flashback scenes. 

There is a detailed description of this production and of behind-the-scenes incidents surrounding it in Davi Napoleon&#x27;s chronicle of the Chelsea, &quot;Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater&quot; (1991). Kalfin&#x27;s adaptation was also staged in the Habima theater in Israel, translated by Nathan Zach and starring Yoram Khatav as Allen and Gila Almagor as Naomi. In June 2014 the play was adapted as a one actor play &quot;Watching from Window&quot; and premiered in &quot;Israel Festival&quot;.

==Notes==
Kaddish (קדיש Aramaic: &quot;holy&quot;) refers to an important and central prayer in the Jewish prayer service. The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God&#x27;s name. In the liturgy, several variations of the Kaddish are used functionally as separators between various sections of the service. The term &quot;Kaddish&quot; is often used to refer specifically to &quot;The Mourners&#x27; Kaddish&quot;, said as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services as well as at funerals and memorials. When mention is made of &quot;saying Kaddish&quot;, this unambiguously denotes the rituals of mourning.

A line from the poem, &quot;No more to say and nothing to weep for&quot;, was later used as the title of a 1997 Channel 4 documentary on Ginsberg released shortly after his death.

<text>Jacaranda is a genus of 49 species of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas while cultivated around the world. The generic name is also used as the common name.

The species &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot; has achieved a cosmopolitan distribution due to introductions, to the extent that it has entered popular culture. It can be found growing wild in Central America, the Caribbean, Spain, Portugal, southern and northern Africa, China, Australia, Rwanda and Cyprus.

==Etymology==
The name is of South American (more specifically Tupi-Guarani) origin, meaning fragrant. The word &quot;jacaranda&quot; was described in &quot;A supplement to Mr. Chambers&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;, 1st ed., (1753) as &quot;a name given by some authors to the tree the wood of which is the log-wood, used in dyeing and medicine&quot; and as being of Tupi-Guarani origin, by way of Portuguese. Although not consistent with the Guarani source, one common pronunciation of the name in English is given by .

==Description==
The species are shrubs to large trees ranging in size from tall. The leaves are bipinnate in most species, pinnate or simple in a few species. The flowers are produced in conspicuous large panicles, each flower with a five-lobed blue to purple-blue corolla; a few species have white flowers. The fruit is an oblong to oval flattened capsule containing numerous slender seeds. The genus differs from other genera in the Bignoniaceae in having a staminode that is longer than the stamens, tricolpate pollen, and a chromosome number of 18.

==Taxonomy==
The genus is divided into two sections, sect. &quot;Monolobos&quot; and sect. &quot;Dilobos&quot; DC., based on the number of thecae on the anthers. Sect. &quot;Monolobos&quot; has 18 species and is found primarily in western South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Sect. &quot;Dilobos&quot;, which is believed to be the primitive form, has 31 species and is found primarily in southeastern Brazil including the Paraná River valley. The anatomy of the wood in the two sections also differs. Although usually treated in sect. &quot;Monolobos&quot;, &quot;J. copaia&quot; differs somewhat from all other members of the genus and may be intermediate between the two sections (Dos Santos &amp; Miller 1997).

==Cultivation==

Jacaranda can be propagated from grafting, cuttings, and seeds, though plants grown from seeds take a long time to bloom. Jacaranda grows in well-drained soil and tolerates drought and brief spells of frost and freeze.

This genus thrives in full sun and sandy soils, which explains their abundance in warmer climates. Mature plants can survive in colder climates down to ; however, they may not bloom as profusely. Younger plants are more fragile and may not survive in colder climates when temperatures drop below freezing.

== Uses ==
Several species are widely grown as ornamental plants throughout the subtropical regions of the world, valued for their intense flower displays. The most often seen is the blue jacaranda (&quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;; syn. &quot;J. acutifolia&quot; hort. non Bonpl.). Other members of the genus are also commercially important; for example the Copaia (&quot;Jacaranda copaia&quot;) is important for its timber because of its exceptionally long bole.

<text>The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture (commonly as Burke Museum) is a natural history museum on the campus of the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is administered by the UW College of Arts and Sciences. Established in 1899 as the Washington State Museum, the museum traces its origins to a high school naturalist club formed in 1879. The museum is the oldest in Washington state and boasts a collection of more than 16 million artifacts, including the world&#x27;s largest collection of spread bird wings. The Burke Museum is the official state museum of Washington.

== History ==

===Young Naturalists Society===
The roots of the Burke Museum can be traced to a natural history club formed by high school students in the 19th century. The group was formed in December 1879 by students Edmond S. Meany, J. O. Young, P. Brooks Randolph, and Charles Denny. Denny&#x27;s father, city founder Arthur Denny, was a regent of the Territorial University of Washington and arranged for the group to meet on campus. The Young Naturalists adopted a constitution and bylaws, and the official name &quot;Young Naturalists Society&quot;, in 1880. As the founding members graduated high school and matriculated to the university, the membership of the Young Naturalists expanded to include university students. 

In 1882 Orson &quot;Bug&quot; Johnson (Orson Bennett Johnson) was retained as a biology instructor at the University of Washington, bringing 20,000 animal specimens with him. Johnson immediately involved himself with the Young Naturalists, and the addition of his collection gave the club the largest natural history collection in the Pacific Northwest. Under Johnson&#x27;s direction, the Young Naturalists began expanding this nucleus of specimens and artifacts, which were stored in a backroom of the Denny home. A permanent structure to house the growing collection was built on the Territorial University&#x27;s campus in 1886, with the club soliciting donations to fund its construction. Many specimens in the collection were regularly borrowed by university faculty to assist in instruction. 

In the 1890s Edmond Meany returned to teach history at the university. He led a revitalization of the group that he had helped found a decade before, bringing in new members, including women. By this point the society&#x27;s collection had grown to include more than 60,000 specimens.

===Transition to the Washington State Museum===
The University of Washington moved its campus from downtown Seattle to its present location in 1895. The portion of the Young Naturalists collection that had been used in university instruction was relocated to the university&#x27;s Denny Hall while the remainder stayed in the Young Naturalists clubhouse downtown. In 1899 the Washington State Legislature designated the portion of Denny Hall used to house the collection as the Washington State Museum. In 1904 the Young Naturalists voted to donate the rest of their collection to the Washington State Museum and disband.

===Carousel of buildings===
The 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition (AYP Expo) brought a boon of construction to the University of Washington&#x27;s campus. When the fair ended, the Washington State Museum moved into its first dedicated building, the fair&#x27;s former California Building.
Persistent leaks in that facility caused it to later relocate to the fair&#x27;s former Forestry Building which, it was soon discovered, was infested with bark beetles. For four years, from 1923 to 1927, the museum&#x27;s collections were disbursed around campus.

The situation was finally resolved in 1927 when the museum moved into what had originally been constructed as the Washington State Building for the AYP Expo.
 In 1929, Erna Gunther became the museum&#x27;s director, a post she would hold for more than 25 years.

The museum found itself, once again, displaced in 1957 after its AYP Expo-era building was condemned.

===New name and buildings===
When Thomas Burke died in 1925, his wife, Caroline McGilvra Burke, sought an appropriate monument for her husband that would &quot;advance the cause of a better mutual understanding between ... the people of the Pacific shores.&quot; A collector of Native American artifacts herself, she bequeathed her personal collection to the museum following her death in 1932. The Burke estate offered to help fund a new state museum, with one major stipulation - the structure had to be named after Burke. Some University officials balked at this, as did Erna Gunther. The institution had been known as the Washington State Museum since 1899, and the Burke funds would only go toward a third of the construction costs. Other funds came from a National Science Foundation grant, but the new building was still smaller than one that Erna Gunther recommended. Nevertheless, the new facility was ultimately dedicated on May 3, 1964, with its new director, Walter A. Fairservis, at the helm.

In 1996, the museum launched a ten-year plan to move its exhibition space off campus and into a downtown Seattle location. Under the proposal, curators and preservationists would continue to work at the University of Washington while exhibits would be hosted at a new site. The proposal ultimately did not materialize. In 2014, the museum made another push for a new facility, asking the Washington State Legislature for half the $95 million needed to construct a 110,000 square-foot facility to replace its current building. The new Burke Museum building finished construction in 2018, and the old building closed at the end of the year to transfer the collection&#x27;s 16 million items before its demolition in April 2019. The new museum cost $106 million to construct and opened to the public on October 12, 2019. The new building, designed by UW alum Tom Kundig, features large windows into research areas to showcase parts of the collection that were not previously exhibited. A garden with 60 species of Washington-native plants will be planted around the new building and its adjacent courtyard, designed to host small events. The new museum also has a small cafe, Off the Rez, that serves Native American cuisine.

== Collections ==

The museum houses more than 16 million artifacts and specimens in its anthropology, biology, and geology research divisions. According to the museum, its ornithology division includes the largest collection of spread bird wings in the world, while the museum&#x27;s collection of frozen bird tissues is the world&#x27;s second largest. The Mammalogy Collection, which is managed by University of Washington professor and Burke Museum curator Sharlene Santana, contains more than 55,000 mammal specimens, and is regarded as the 10th largest collection of mammals in a North American university. The museum states that its collection of Northwest Coast ethnographic material is the fifth largest collection of Native American art in the world, numbering 10,000 objects, among which are &quot;the important early Swan, Eells, Emmons, and Waters collections, as well as the unmatched Blackman-Hall and Ottenberg contemporary silkscreen print collections, and the Steinman contemporary Northwest Coast sculpture collection.&quot; The museum&#x27;s Northwest Coast image research database includes &quot;the Holm/Wright collection of images of Northwest Coast art from 200 museums and private collections, the Harris collection of Northwest Coast silver jewelry images, and de Menil photographs of Northwest Coast totem poles, as well as the George MacDonald Archive of historical Northwest Coast photographs.&quot;

== Exhibits ==

=== Past long-term exhibits ===
Prior to its temporary closure in 2018, the museum displayed three long-term exhibits: &quot;Life and Times of Washington State&quot;, &quot;Pacific Voices&quot;, and &quot;Treasures of the Burke&quot;. &quot;Life and Times of Washington State&quot; was a natural history exhibit on the 545-million-year evolution of the Northwest region. Features of this exhibit included large-scale fossils such as an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; skeleton cast and a giant ground sloth fossil found during the construction of Sea-Tac International Airport. There were also displays that explained the geologic history of the area and its influence on the terrain and climate.

&quot;Pacific Voices&quot; was a cultural exhibit that told the stories or traditions of 19 different Native American and Pacific Rim cultures through art, artifacts, ceremonial objects, and audio/visual documentaries.

=== Temporary exhibits ===
The Burke also hosts a schedule of different exhibits throughout the year in its temporary gallery. These changing exhibits include traveling exhibits organized by other institutions and original exhibits curated by Burke staff. In November 2022 the Burke will host &quot;Body Language: Reawakening Cultural Tattooing of the Northwest.&quot;

=== Present long-term exhibits ===

The museum reopened in its new building on October 12, 2019, with several new exhibits: &quot;Culture is Living&quot;, &quot;Northwest Native Art&quot;, &quot;Amazing Life&quot;, &quot;Our Material World&quot;, and &quot;Fossils Uncovered&quot;. Each gallery focuses on a particular category of Washington State natural history and culture. In &quot;Culture is Living&quot;, patrons can engage with objects past and present and hear from community across the Pacific. &quot;Fossils Uncovered&quot; includes one of the best-preserved &quot;T. rex&quot; skulls in the world, as well as numerous other fossils.

== Publications ==

The museum publishes a scientific journal, Burke Museum Contributions in Anthropology and Natural History, established in 1986.

== Museum governance ==

=== Governing body ===
The museum is administered through the University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences; the University of Washington Board of Regents serves as the museum&#x27;s governing body.

=== BMA ===
The Burke Museum Association (BMA) is an organization made up of the Burke&#x27;s board of trustees and an advisory council. Their mission is to actively support the Burke Museum by increasing public visibility, raising public and private funds to support programming and future expansion, and providing strong ties to the community.

=== Funding ===
In 2009, the museum had an annual budget of about $5 million, half of which came from an appropriation from the state of Washington. The budget did not include substantial in-kind support provided by the University of Washington as owner of the Burke property. Other sources of funding include interest from its endowment (10 percent), foundation grants and individual donations (27 percent), and admission fees and gift shop sales (13 percent).

<doc id="722390" wikidata="Q4732120" url="?curid=722390" title="Allergic reactions to anesthesia">
<text>The incidence of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions occurring during surgery and anesthesia is around one in 10,000 procedures. Severe allergic reactions to anesthetic medications are rare and are usually attributable to factors other than the anesthetic. Neuromuscular blocking agents, natural rubber latex, and antibiotics are the most common causes of serious allergic reactions during surgery. The mortality rate from these reactions ranges between 3-9%.

Successful immediate treatment requires prompt recognition by the attending anesthetist, or in the US, the attending anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist. Anesthetists are trained to recognise if an allergic reaction is occurring. The identification of a complication is made by the recognition of issues such as low blood pressure, hives, wheezing, rash, swelling around the eyes or in the mouth and throat and other breathing difficulties. Adrenaline (epinephrine) remains the mainstay of treatment, with corticosteroids and antihistamines providing limited benefit in the acute situation.

Subsequent investigation aims to determine the responsible agent to allow its future avoidance. Skin testing is often useful to identify potentially cross-reactive compounds and appropriate therapeutic alternatives. This is done weeks after the initial reaction to allow the immune system to reset itself. However, skin testing can be misleading in giving false positive and false negative results.

== Anaphylaxis during anesthesia ==
Although complications during anesthesia are rare, potentially life-threatening consequences may occur if an anaphylactic reaction develops. The severity of the reaction whilst under anesthesia is because the anesthetist is only made aware of the allergy when it is severe enough to compromise the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system. At this stage, there is little time to manage the situation and recognise the severity of the condition.

The immediate management of the issue consists of three processes:
* The withdrawal of the substances
* Interrupting the effects of the preformed substances released in response to toxin presentation
* Prevention of further substance release
Since the full withdrawal of the offending substance is near impossible, the administration of adrenaline is the main treatment to counteract the effects. Once the patient is stable they will need close observation for 24 hours.

<doc id="722391" wikidata="Q7734927" url="?curid=722391" title="The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead">
<text>The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead or more recently The Forum is an American, English language newspaper. It is the major newspaper for Fargo, North Dakota and the surrounding region, including Moorhead, Minnesota. It is the flagship and namesake of Forum Communications. &quot;The Forum&quot;, as it is commonly known, is the primary paper for southeast North Dakota, and also much of northwest Minnesota. Its average daily circulation was about 47,100 on Sundays and 37,500 on Saturdays prior to reducing its print schedule to semi-weekly. &quot;The Fargo Forum&quot; was first published on November 17, 1891 by Major A. W. Edwards. However, it traces its lineage to &quot;The Republican&quot;, which had been founded by Edwards in 1878 and merged into &quot;the Forum&quot; in 1894.

It has been owned by the family of Norman B. Black since 1917. Publisher Bill Marcil, Jr. is the son of Black&#x27;s great-granddaughter; he is the fifth generation of the family to run the paper and the company. It took its current form in 1966 when it merged with the &quot;Moorhead Daily News,&quot; which was acquired by The Forum in 1957.

&quot;The Forum&quot; is also co-owned with radio station WDAY AM and TV stations WDAY-TV and WDAZ-TV. It used to own KOYY under the call sign WDAY-FM. In spring 2008, &quot;The Forum&quot;&#x27;s news staff merged with WDAY-AM&#x27;s news team, forming one of the first joint radio-print news-gathering operations in the country.

In 2015, higher education reporter Grace Lyden won the NDNA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award for her &quot;bulldog tenacity.&quot;

In 2020, the newspaper reduced its print schedule to Wednesdays and Saturdays due to economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="722393" wikidata="Q5448582" url="?curid=722393" title="Filipino Canadians">
<text>The Filipino Canadians (); () are Canadians who have a Filipino descent or ethnicity. The Filipino Canadians is the second largest subgroup of the overseas Filipinos, surpassed only by the United States, and one of the fastest-growing minority in Canada.

Only a small population of Filipinos lived in Canada until the late 20th century. At the 2016 Canadian census, 851,410 people of Filipino descent lived in Canada, mostly in urban areas. The majority of Filipino Canadians speak Tagalog. Filipino Canadians are the third-largest Asian Canadian group in the nation after the Indian and Chinese communities. They are also the largest group from Southeast Asia in the country. Between the 2011 and 2016 censuses, the Filipino community in Canada grew from 702,200 to 820,100, a growth of about 7%, compared to the rest of Canada, which grew by 5% during the same time period.

By the 2021 census, Filipino Canadians enumerated 957,355, or 2.58% of the total population, further displaying the community&#x27;s rapid growth.

==Early Filipinos in British Columbia==

Filipino migration to North America began with Philippine-made ships crossing the Pacific Ocean during the Manila galleon trade. As early as 1565, Spain began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. Filipino servants, stowaways, and mariners arrived in parts of the west coast of North America, from what is now Mexico to as far north as Alaska. By late 1700s, &quot;Manila men&quot; were recruited in naval operations, aboard the ship &quot;San Carlos el Filipino&quot; sent to support the short-lived Spanish settlement of Santa Cruz de Nuca and Fort San Miguel, Nootka Island, off the coast of Vancouver Island.

Canada&#x27;s earliest documented Filipinos coincided with North America&#x27;s first wave of Asian immigration in the 1800s. At least nine male Filipino sailors, aged twenty-four to forty-two, appeared on the 1881 census of British Columbia. Living on a vessel in New Westminster, they were recorded ethno-racially as &quot;Malay&quot; [a loose term to describe Austronesian people] and listed as &quot;Mahomitan&quot; [an archaic term for Muslim].

A small Filipino community resided in Bowen Island, British Columbia in the 1880s. They probably engaged in both fishing and farming. They included Fernando Toreenya, a fisherman who came to Canada from the Philippines in 1886 at the age of 20 years old. With his First Nations partner Mary/Marie Adams, they lived in Snug Cove and had three other Filipino boarders living with them, William Matilda, Antoni Bentorre, and Ricardo Castro. Others included Ben Flores, who were &quot;beachcombers and fishermen&quot; and were settled on a barge in Snug Cove; Basinto Pasento, who called his home Pasento Ranch and died in February 1904, John Delmond, and Jose Garcia. Several others worked as loggers, millhand, mine labourers, and longshoremen intermarrying with Indigenous peoples and other Pacific Islanders. By the turn of the century, there was a significant number of Filipinos; they were either naturalized as Canadians or were U.S. nationals in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia.

==History of Filipinos in Canada==
Larger numbers of Filipinos migrated to Canada in the 1930s. In 1950, 10 Filipinos were recorded in Manitoba. The first-generation Filipino Canadians were mainly women who worked as nurses and teachers and in the health sector. These first Filipinos came from the United States to renew their visas after they had expired in the hope of returning to the U.S. Most of them returned, but some stayed in Canada.

From 1946 to 1964, the total number of Filipinos in Canada was 770. In the 1960s, Canada recruited more professionals, mostly from the United States, with some coming directly from the Philippines. Most of the nurses, technicians, office workers and doctors arrived in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In the late 1960s, more Filipinos came to Winnipeg to work in the garment industry.

During the 1970s, most Filipinos came directly from the Philippines to Winnipeg to work in clerical, sales and manufacturing fields. In the late 1970s, more Filipinos came to join their relatives who worked in Canada under the family reunification program. More and more Filipinos decided to settle in Ontario, particularly in Toronto, where jobs were prospering.

In the 1980s, Canada saw an influx of Filipino contract workers, many who found work as live-in caregivers. Many of the contract workers later became landed immigrants under the Live-In Caregiver Program.

During the 1990s, more Filipinos came as families and independents instead of being sponsored by family or being recruited as contract workers.

From 1990 onward, there has been a steady flow of Filipinos entering Canada, with about 10,000 to 20,000 coming in every year. In December 2008, the Philippines passed China as Canada&#x27;s leading source of immigrants.

==Wealth, education, politics, and socioeconomics==

As of 2016, Filipino Canadians are a relatively recent immigrant group with the majority immigrating after the 2000s; most identify as first-generation or generation 1.5 (adolescent) immigrants. Out of the 780,130 Filipino Canadians, only 13,125 considered themselves third-generation. 74.5% OF Filipino Canadians are first generation.

Filipino Canadians are paid less than those who are not a visible ethnic minority and the total population. It was reported that the Average Employment Income for Filipino Canadians was $41,280 which was significantly lower compared to those who are not a visible ethnic minority ($52,550) and the total population ($50,280). 

Filipino Canadians had more earners per family. About 81% of the Filipino group lived in families with two or more earners, compared with 55% of the White group. 39.9% had three or more family members with employment income. 

If the Filipino group had a similar sociodemographic profile as the White group, its poverty rate would be about 1 percentage point higher than the observed rate for the group. 

Filipino Canadian men and women were the least likely among all visible minorities to be unemployed at 5.8% and 4.7% respectively.

Filipino Canadians were largely more educated but had a significantly lower rate of attaining a Graduate degree then other ethnic groups.

Filipino Canadians are more likely to work in the health care industry and the social assistance industry (20.6%) than some other visible minorities.

Despite representing a large immigration group, there have been only two Filipino-Canadians elected as federal members of parliament: Rey Pagtakhan (1988) and Rechie Valdez (2021).

==Immigration==
According to the 2021 Canadian census, Philippines is the third largest source country for immigration to Canada.

===Greater Toronto Area===

The Greater Toronto Area (GTA), which includes the city of Toronto, and the regional municipalities of Durham, Halton, Peel, and York, is home to the largest Filipino community in Canada with a third of all Filipino Canadians calling the GTA home. As of the 2016 Census, there were 282,385 people of Filipino descent living in the GTA making them the fourth largest visible minority group behind the Indian, Chinese, and Black communities. The number of Filipino Canadians in the GTA grew from 252,120 in 2011 to 282,385 in 2016 representing a growth of 12% in 5 years.

Tagalog is the fifth most spoken language, other than English or French, to be spoken in the GTA, and is also one of the fastest-growing languages in the region. Other Philippine languages, such as Ilocano, and Cebuano, also have a sizeable number of speakers throughout the region.

A huge percentage of the Filipino diaspora in GTA are working professionals. Several Filipino-owned businesses have also sprouted all over the metropolitan area. In 2017, Seafood City, a Filipino-owned supermarket chain in the United States, opened its first Canadian location in Mississauga. Other Filipino establishments like Jollibee, CrispyTown, Grill City, and Philippine National Bank have also established roots in the GTA.

====Population distribution====
Filipinos are generally well spread out throughout the GTA, with a few areas of concentration. In the city of Toronto, the former municipalities of Scarborough and North York are popular destinations for new Filipino immigrants and naturalized Filipino Canadians alike. According to the 2016 Census, Tagalog is the most common non-English mother tongue language in the following neighborhoods:
# Clanton Park (11.2%)
# Briar Hill-Belgravia (10.4%)
# Englemount-Lawrence (10.1%)
# Ionview (9.4%)
# Kennedy Park (8.2%)
# North St. James Town (8.1%)
# Forest Hill North (6.9%)
# Wexford-Maryvale (6.8%)
# Humewood-Cedarvale (6.0%)
# West Hill (4.7%)
# Bedford Park-Nortown (4.2%)
# Guildwood (2.2%)
# Forest Hill South (2.0%)
Other Philippine languages also ranked among the most common non-English mother tongue languages. Ilocano ranked in the top 10 non-English mother tongue languages in three neighbourhoods (Briar Hill-Belgravia, Englemount-Lawrence, Clanton Park). Cebuano also ranked in the top 10 languages for the Briar Hill-Belgravia neighbourhood.

Outside of the city of Toronto, Mississauga, Markham and Vaughan in York Region, Ajax and Pickering in Durham Region, and Milton in Halton Region have large percentages of Filipino residents.
Brampton contains a large concentration of Filipinos. Most Filipinos in Brampton live in Bramalea or in downtown Brampton. Some Filipino families have migrated into more affluent pockets like Peel Village around Bartley Bull Parkway. 

As of the 2016 Canadian Census:

City of Toronto
*Total - 162,600 (6.0% &quot;of total population&quot;)
Durham Region
*Total – 16,270 (2.5%)
Halton Region
*Total – 12,225 (2.2%)
Peel Region
*Total – 62,460 (4.5%)
York Region
*Total – 28,830 (2.6%)

===Metro Vancouver===
Vancouver is home to Canada&#x27;s second largest Filipino community, with nearly 134,000 Filipinos residing there. Filipinos in Vancouver make up the third-largest Asian Canadian and visible minority group behind the Chinese and South Asians. Most of British Columbia&#x27;s 159,000 Filipinos reside in the Greater Vancouver Area. Overall, about one in five Filipinos in Canada call Metro Vancouver home.

Filipinos, along many other Asian Canadians, contribute to the city&#x27;s economy greatly with their work ethic. Many of the Filipinos in Vancouver work in the health and finance industries, with also a significant percentage who work in service, manufacturing, and real estate. Several others are business owners, with some bringing well-known franchise chains like Pepper Lunch and Chatime to the city. Qoola, a local frozen yogurt chain with over 20 locations, is also founded by a Manila-born businessman. Big restaurant names like Max&#x27;s of Manila, and Jollibee have also made their presence in the city.

In addition, Vancouver is home to Canada&#x27;s first Goldilocks Bakeshop franchise. Ayala Land, the Philippines&#x27; leading real estate development company, recently completed a mix-use residential development with local real estate developer company, Rize, in Vancouver&#x27;s Mt. Pleasant neighbourhood.

===Winnipeg===
Winnipeg is home to 77,305 Filipinos, making up the third largest Filipino community in Canada by total population. However, Filipinos make up a greater percentage of the Winnipeg city population (8.7%) than any other city in Canada. The Filipino community in Winnipeg is the largest visible minority group in Winnipeg, ahead of the Chinese-Canadians and Indo-Canadians (but excluding Indigenous Canadians, who are not counted as a visible minority by Statistics Canada). Winnipeg is home to one of the oldest Filipino communities in Canada, with immigration to Winnipeg beginning before 1950. Winnipeg was home to the largest Filipino community before the 1980s. About one out of 10 Filipinos in Canada call Winnipeg home. 

Winnipeg includes a Filipino community centre called The Philippine Canadian Centre of Manitoba (PCCM), providing social and service to the Filipino community and also holding events such as Folklorama. There are also Filipino newspapers such as &quot;The Pilipino Express News Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Filipino Journal&quot;, and &quot;Ang Peryodiko&quot;. There is also a radio station, CKJS, which broadcasts Filipino-related news, music, lifestyle and much more.

Winnipeg&#x27;s Filipino population is largely concentrated in the West End and North End areas of the city. The neighbourhood around Sargent Avenue and Arlington Street is 45% Filipino, and the neighbourhood around Sargent Avenue and Wall Street is 47% Filipino.

Filipinos in Winnipeg contribute greatly to the local economy. Jollibee, a well known global Filipino fast food chain, has its first 2 Canadian locations established in this city.

===Calgary Metropolitan Region===
Calgary is home to over 75,000 Filipinos making them the fourth largest Filipino community in Canada. Filipinos started coming in droves in Calgary in the early 1980s and 1990s. Outside of Calgary, some smaller communities are experiencing an influx of Filipino immigrants to fill job vacancies. These new immigrants and their children work to integrate and flourish in Canada.

===Edmonton Metropolitan Region===
According to the 2016 Canadian census, 64,275 Filipinos live and work in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. Various Filipino associations celebrate the culture and take part in large metropolitan events such as the Edmonton Heritage Festival. In 2002, the Filipino community presented its home nation as the &quot;Featured Country&quot; during Capital Ex (formerly Klondike Days). Edmonton is also the home of the Philippine Cultural Society, the Philippine Choral Society, and the Karilagan Dance Society.

Radio station CKER-FM also broadcasts community programming to Filipinos in Edmonton.

===Greater Montreal===
The sixth largest Filipino community in Canada, Montreal is home to nearly 36,000 Filipinos. Filipinos in Montreal are concentrated in the Snowdon neighbourhood and around Decarie Expressway, both areas have many Filipino establishments and professional offices. The Filipino Association of Montreal and Suburbs is an advocacy group for Filipino Canadians active in and around the city of Montreal. It is the oldest such association in Quebec.

===National Capital Region===
The National Capital Region made up of the cities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec is home to the seventh largest Filipino community in Canada with over 14,000 Filipinos residing in Canada&#x27;s capital. Ottawa is also the home of the Philippine Embassy and ambassador to Canada.

===Southwestern Ontario===
Southwestern Ontario is home to over 15,000 Filipinos. Most of them live in the cities of Cambridge, Guelph, Kitchener, London, and Windsor. Southwestern Ontario is home to a successful and thriving Filipino community.

===Hamilton===
The city of Hamilton situated on the western shore of Lake Ontario is home to almost 12,000 Filipinos. Hamilton is home to the first Filipino community centre and school in Canada both opening in the early 80s and late 70s, respectively.

===Niagara Region===
The Niagara Region on the south shore of Lake Ontario is home to over 4,000 Filipinos. They form a tight knit community concentrated in the cities of St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. Niagara-on-the-lake is home to a very successful community and the only town to have had a Filipino mayor in Canada, Arturo Viola.

===Northern Canada===
The northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have a Filipino community of almost 3,000 despite an extremely cold climate. The Filipino community has grown steadily from 735 in 2001. Filipinos in the Northwest Territories make the largest visible minority group there with a population of 1,410. Filipinos in the Yukon Territory are the second-largest minority group to the Chinese with a community of 1,310 living there. Nunavut has a growing Filipino population of 245. The territories received about 50 Filipinos on average a year from 2001 to 2006.

==Demographics==
Most Filipinos who immigrate to Canada settle in the large urban areas where there are more jobs and a vibrant community life. These areas include: Metro Vancouver, Greater Calgary, Edmonton Capital Region, City of Winnipeg, the Greater Toronto Area, and Greater Montreal. According to Statistics Canada seeing the current trend, by 2031, the Filipino Canadian population is projected to reach between 1.9 and 2.1 million. Much of this growth will be bolstered by high immigration rates, assuming immigration to the United States remains as restricted as it has been. Notably, Canada now has a Filipino population more than twice as large percentage-wise as that of the United States, the Philippines&#x27; former colonizer. The Filipino population in Canada is also somewhat more dispersed, as the majority of Filipino Americans are found in the far western and southern United States.

<text>Toncontín Airport formerly Toncontín International Airport, also known as Teniente Coronel Hernán Acosta Mejía Airport is a civil and military airport located from the centre of Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

The History Channel programme &quot;Most Extreme Airports&quot; ranks it as the second most extreme airport in the world. The approach to the airport is considered to be one of the most difficult in the world to all aircraft, especially in inclement weather conditions.

==History==
Since the 19th century, the plains south of Tegucigalpa became known as the &quot;&quot;Potrero Los Llanos&quot;, part of a farm adjoining the farm Loarque. In these areas, some political events took place. José Santos Guardiola defeated General José Trinidad Cabañas, seizing presidency of the republic. &quot;El Llano&quot;&quot; as it was known, is to the south end of Comayagüela. On a road to the south is the field that served for the takeoff and landing of aircraft. Currently, this forms the Hernán Acosta Mejía (HAM) Air Force base. The first landing was in 1921 when a single-engine plane from the Bristol Aeroplane Company landed with Captain Dean Ivan Lamb in command. He was received by President Rafael López Gutiérrez who broke a bottle of champagne on one of the aircraft&#x27;s propellers.

The origin of the name &quot;Toncontín&quot; is unknown, but experts say that it is a word derived from the Nahuatl word &quot;Tocotín&quot;, the name of an ancient and sacred dance of Yucatán in Mexico.

Aviator Luigi Venditti conducted several flights using the natural floodplain from Toncontín. Jose Villa, an Italian national, was another precursor of Honduran aviation who conducted flights from Toncontín, as did Starnaivola, Enrique Massi, Ball, and Clarence H. Brown.

The civil war in 1924 caused President Tiburcio Carías Andino to realise that aviation had a great future in Honduras, providing an ideal transport solution for the mountainous country, as well as being a strategic military weapon. For these reasons and with the growth of commercial aviation and the emergence of the Honduran Air Force, General Tiburcio Carías acquired the land that was to become Toncontín Airport in 1933. On January 5, 1934, the airport was inaugurated with the landing of a Douglas DC-3 from Pan American World Airways. Months later TACA opened &quot;Hotel Toncontín&quot; to accommodate passengers in transit, and Pan-Am built a hangar.

During the Football War of 1969, Toncontín Airport was a major target for the Salvadoran Air Force, and was bombed on several occasions, thus preventing the Honduran Air Force from launching its aircraft. The airport was repaired in a matter of days, and the Hondurans countered, making good progress.

==Facilities==

The airport received much notoriety as being one of the most dangerous in the world due to its proximity to mountainous terrain, its short runway, and its historically difficult approach to runway 02. For years efforts were made to replace it with Soto Cano Air Base in Comayagua, which did not occur until 2021 when Comayagua International Airport opened there. In the meantime, Toncontín was significantly improved by the work of the Airport Corporation of Tegucigalpa (ACT) and InterAirports, a company contracted by the Honduran government to administer the country&#x27;s four major airports.

The airport has a single asphalt runway, situated at an elevation of AMSL. Until May 2009, the runway was only in length. In 2007, the approach to runway 02 was made significantly easier by work which systematically bulldozed a large portion of the hillside, immediately before the threshold. Following this work, in May 2009, the southern end of the runway received a extension, lengthening it to . As of 2011, the runway is listed as being .

Boeing 737-200s operated by seasonal charter airline Aviatsa are the largest aircraft that normally land at Toncontín. Even with its recent runway extension, Toncontín&#x27;s runway is still significantly shorter than that of most international airports. It is so short, in fact, that many aircraft seen by plane spotters are seen to be touching down on the displaced threshold of the runway, which by aviation law is not allowed to be landed on.

Historically, larger aircraft have occasionally landed at Toncontín, such as a Douglas DC-8 on a mission with Orbis International in 1987, a C-17 Globemaster in 2008, 2009 and 2011, and Boeing 757s operated by American Airlines, which in 2015 replaced them with Airbus A319s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, SAHSA operated Boeing 727s and Boeing 737s from its hub at Toncontín.

Toncontín International Airport has 4 gates (2 in the new terminal), a post office, a bank and &quot;bureau de change&quot;, many restaurants, and several airline lounges, as well as a duty-free shop, car rental services, and a first-aid room. The old terminal is undergoing renovation, and will be used for domestic flights in the future. The new terminal was used for international flights until 2021.

Toncontín was also the home of the &quot;Aeroclub de Honduras&quot; (Honduran Air Club).

==International flights suspension==
On May 30, 2008, the crash of TACA Flight 390 prompted the announcement by then Honduran President Manuel Zelaya that all large aircraft operations would move to the Soto Cano Air Base. This move would effectively move all international traffic from Toncontín, limiting its use to only domestic flights and small aircraft.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) completed a review of Toncontín and made safety recommendations regarding the airport. On June 25, 2008, President Zelaya reiterated his position of severely restricting international traffic to and from Toncontín and announced his intention to form a commission that would oversee implementing the safety recommendations of the ICAO report.

On July 8, 2008, President Zelaya announced the reopening of Toncontín airport at a news conference following a three-hour meeting with businessmen, who had demanded commercial flights resume at Toncontín due to Soto Cano Air Base being too far from Tegucigalpa. Zelaya reiterated that all commercial flights would eventually use the new airport at Soto Cano from 2009. This however, was canceled after Zelaya was removed from office on June 28, 2009, in the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état. International flights continued to operate to Toncontín until November 15, 2021.

==Toncontín today==
* In 2009 TACA Airlines could not operate to Toncontín and apparently the rest of the country&#x27;s airports because of a state debt to Honduras, but on May 20, 2009, TACA said that the problems with Honduras were resolved.
* In 2009 Authorities at the airport finally decided to make use of masks and other measures to prevent the H1N1 flu virus, since the number of cases had risen to 34 in the country.
* In 2009, one year after the crash of TACA Flight 390 at Toncontín airport that killed five people, business owners near the site of the tragedy complained that they had not been compensated.
* In 2008 Honduras&#x27; President Manuel Zelaya said that Tegucigalpa, the capital of the country, would benefit from the construction of the Palmerola airport, while others claim that this was an attempt to close Toncontín.
* The Civil Aviation Authority of Honduras temporarily suspended the operating license of Islena Airlines, part of the Taca El Salvador group, for outstanding debts of 37 million Honduran lempira, leaving the service of internal flights to Honduras in crisis.
* In May 2009, a extension was completed on the south end of the runway, increasing the length of the runway from to . The extension is helpful for take-offs to the north, and rare landings from the north, however, it is debatable whether it will assist with standard landings from the south due to the proximity to nearby mountains.
* On July 5, 2009, the airport was closed to all flights and the airspace in and around Toncontín was severely restricted due to the planned arrival of ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya. Zelaya&#x27;s private Venezuelan jet was not given landing clearance by the Authorities at Toncontín and the military blocked the single runway with vehicles and troops. The plane was then diverted to Managua, Nicaragua.
* Due to the bombing attempt by Al-Qaeda of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009; the security at Toncontín was increased with the use of undercover police officers at the airport.
* On January 27, 2010, Honduran ex-president Manuel Zelaya and his family left the country after 120 days seeking refuge at the Brazilian Embassy, they left at 14:45 from Toncontín International Airport, to the Dominican Republic, where Zelaya proposed to hold a trial against the people who ran the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. Thousands of Hondurans were present outside the airport to witness the moment Zelaya left the country.
* In April 2011, the airport authority and the government of Honduras resumed airport relocation talks and announced that work on the new Palmerola airport would start by the fall of 2011 after years of efforts to replace Toncontín International with an airport at Palmerola in Comayagua where the Soto Cano Air Base is located. However, in a September 25, 2011 update, President Lobo stated officials were still &quot;evaluating the pros and cons&quot; of constructing the new airport. This comes three years after former President Manuel Zelaya had announced that all commercial flights would be transferred to Soto Cano Air Base; however, work on the new terminal at Soto Cano was then cancelled after Zelaya was removed from office on 28 June 2009 in the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état. Upon realization of the Palmerola airport, commercial flights to and from Toncontín would continue to operate but will be limited to small aircraft and domestic flights.
* During 2018, the airport received 625,593 passengers.
* As of December 15, 2021, all international carriers operating at Toncontin have moved operations to the new recently inaugurated Comayagua International Airport located in the military air base of Palmerola, located from Tegucigalpa. Among the airlines that have moved operations are: American Airlines, Avianca El Salvador, Copa Airlines and United Airlines. Airlines such as Aeroméxico Connect and Spirit Airlines are the new international carriers operating to/from Tegucigalpa/Comayagua.

==Operations==

===Runway 02 approach===
Because of the terrain in Tegucigalpa, aircraft cannot easily be accommodated on a traditional straight-in approach for Runway 02, the most frequently used runway because of wind direction. Instead, an RNAV (GPS) approach is used, resembling a circle-to-land approach. Aircraft are routed through shallower terrain in a circular fashion, then follow along the Anillo Periferico road to a cloverleaf interchange, at which point aircraft take a sharp left turn to line up with runway 02. Until the partial demolition of the hillside, aircraft experienced limited ground clearance just before the threshold, hence had to approach slightly higher than optimal, increasing the challenge of the landing already made challenging by the short runway.
To maximize the amount of runway available, many aircraft land on the displaced threshold, just before the actual 02 threshold.

===Runway 02 departure===
Departures from runway 02 must turn to a heading of 018 degrees and then climb swiftly to 9000 feet to avoid mountainous terrain just north of the airport. Because of the short length of the runway and the high altitude of the airport, aircraft require a large amount of power to do this, making late go-arounds potentially dangerous if not executed properly, especially in a plane with a poorer power-to-weight ratio that climbs slower.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==
* 7 June 1962: A Curtiss C-46 Commando, (HR-SAL), a cargo flight operated by SAHSA, crash-landed at Toncontín when the left undercarriage collapsed on touchdown. Both crew members survived but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* 30 June 1966: A Douglas DC-6, (HR-TNG), operated by Transportes Aéreos Nacionales overran the runway on landing and was destroyed by fire.
* 20 February 1967: A Douglas DC-6, (HR-SAS) operated by SAHSA overran the runway whilst attempting to land on runway 01 at Toncontín. According to crew reports, the reverse thrust mechanism failed to engage and the crew had to brake hard causing two tires to catch fire. The nose gear overran the runway into a ditch, followed by the left main gear leg. Out of 50 passengers and 5 crew on board, 4 were killed.
* 25 November 1969: A Douglas DC-3, (HR-ANA), operated by SAHSA crashed while attempting to land on runway 01 at Toncontín. A strong wind gust upset the aircraft during flare, which pushed the aircraft towards the terminal buildings. The crew force-turned away from the buildings and crashed. All 15 passengers and 3 crew survived.
* 26 May 1970: A de Havilland Heron operated by Aero Servicios crashed during approach to runway 19, from the runway. The aircraft banked steeply to the left, and crashed in a nearby valley. The cause of the accident was attributed to a stall brought about by turbulent wind conditions at low altitude. 4 passengers and 2 crew were killed.
* 25 February 1989: A privately owned Douglas DC-6 (HR-AKZ) struck a mountain on approach to Toncontín and crashed. All 10 people aboard were killed.
* 21 October 1989: TAN-SAHSA Flight 414, a Boeing 727-200 on approach to runway 01 at Toncontín, crashed into a nearby hill, killing 131 of 146 people aboard. The cause of the crash was attributed to pilot error by disregarding the prescribed approach procedures.
* 1 April 1997: A U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane overshot the runway at Toncontín and came to rest on a civilian highway interchange, where it caught fire. The cause of the crash was attributed to excess speed on landing, resulting in a prolonged flare. The aircraft touched down beyond the runway 02 threshold.
* 30 May 2008: TACA Flight 390, an Airbus A320, overran the runway after landing on runway 02 at Toncontín. The aircraft plunged 20m down an embankment and came to rest on a road. 3 of the 124 people aboard and 2 people on the ground were killed.
* 14 February 2011: Central American Airways Flight 731, a Let L-410 Turbolet, crashed on approach to Toncontin 20 km from the airport, in Las Mesitas, Municipio de Santa Ana. All 14 aboard were killed.
* 22 May 2018: A chartered Gulfstream G200 jet flying from Texas to Honduras crash landed at the Toncontin International Airport in Honduras&#x27;s capital Tegucigalpa. At least six Americans were injured. The Gulfstream G200 aircraft was on a private flight from Austin, Texas, when it skidded off the runway. Authorities have given conflicting accounts of how many were on board, some saying six or nine, but a police official did say &quot;Thank God there are no fatalities.&quot; One witness told AFP he helped five men and a woman out of the plane, all of whom were &quot;practically unharmed&quot;. The executive jet, which split in half, had veered into a ditch, a Honduran official told local media.

==History==

===Rhode Island Boy Scouts===
The American Boy Scouts of Rhode Island was founded by Charles E. Mulhearn on August 29, 1910, with the meeting of an executive committee. The next day, the committee requested a charter from the New England Department Headquarters of the American Boy Scouts. At a September 8, 1910 executive committee meeting, the organization selected its first officers. On March 12, 1911, the organization voted to break away from the American Boy Scouts and was renamed as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts. The State issued a state charter to the RIBS as a state institution.

In 1917 RIBS merged with the BSA with the BSA granting all members of RIBS back service.

RIBS kept its corporate identity after the merger allowing it to continue receiving bequests, funds, and properties. RIBS owns many of the properties operated by Narragansett Council with the exception of Cachalot Scout Reservation, acquired through a 2002 merger with Moby Dick Council (New Bedford, Massachusetts), and Camp Norse which was acquired in 2015 through a merger with Annawon Council (Norton, Massachusetts).

===Massasoit Council===
The Fall River Council rechartered as the Massasoit Council. It was headquartered in Fall River, Massachusetts and served that city and the surrounding communities of Somerset, Swansea, Westport, Tiverton and Little Compton. The Wampanoag District served Somerset and Swansea. The Council Office was located in the Women&#x27;s Union Building on Rock Street. The Massasoit Council existed until 1972.

The primary source for Boy Scout uniforms and gear was McWhirr&#x27;s department store on South Main Street in Fall River. Many Council-wide Scouting events were often held at Lincoln Park in Westport, Massachusetts. The Firestone Rubber Company, which had a large factory in Fall River, sponsored the Firestone Award for outstanding Boy Scouts in the Massasoit Council in the 1950s and 1960s. These recognition events were held at White&#x27;s in Westport.

 Camping for the Fall River Council began in 1917 at Camp Stanford in Fall River and provided an outlet for boys for four years. It was decided in 1921 at a Fall River Council Executive Board meeting that the purchase of a wooded area would take place, naming it Camp Noquochoke. Additional land was purchased in Camp Noquochoke&#x27;s later years covering over on the eastern shore of the Westport River in Westport. Camp site facilities ranged from undeveloped, to tent sites with platforms, to A-frames (&quot;Adirondacks&quot;) to cabins with stoves and bunk beds.

The physical facilities were significantly improved in the late 1950s with a new dining hall (constructed by Fall River (Building) Trades Council with site work provided by the Navy Seabees Reservists) and an in-ground pool. The Navy Seabee Reservists did upgrade the camp road from the entrance on Pine Hill Road to its termination by the former or old dining hall ending at the river&#x27;s bluff. The Seabees also did the site work for the new dining hall, dugout the archery range and may have partially or completely built the rifle range on the newly acquired Donovan property. This work done by the Seabees was part of their community service, especially non-profit agencies.

Camp legend, the basis for many campfire stories, was a character named &quot;Three-fingered Willie.&quot; Camp Noquochoke continued to serve area youth until 1980.

===Cachalot Council===
On May 13, 1935, as part of complying with new rules of incorporation for Boy Scout councils in Massachusetts, the New Bedford Council changed its name to the Cachalot Council. The name, derived from the French and Portuguese words for sperm whale, was proposed by Joe Allen, of the [Martha&#x27;s] Vineyard Gazette, in January 1933 to honor the history of whaling in New Bedford.

At the time, the Council did own a property that was used as a camp. This property, off Rock O&#x27; Dundee Road in South Dartmouth [2], was too small and lacked adequate water sources, both for drinking and swimming. For a short time, from 1937 through 1942, the council shared the summer camp facilities of the Fall River Council [3], but this was deemed &quot;not satisfactory for many reasons.&quot; [4] From 1943 through 1945, summer camp was held at Camp Maxim, which was owned by the local Boys Club, and also failed to meet the needs of the program.

In 1945, the Cachalot Council conducted a capital fundraising campaign expressly for the purpose of acquiring a suitable camp. Many local businesses and individuals contributed, and the campaign successfully raised $75,000. At the same time, the council began looking for a suitable property. After considering several properties [5], they placed on offer on a large parcel adjacent to the southeastern corner of Myles Standish State Forest, owned by &quot;The Five Mile Corporation.&quot; This corporation, headed by Theodore Steinway (of Steinway &amp; Sons Piano), Albert Hathaway, and Russell Davis, had purchased the property during the Great Depression for a mere $12,000, and agreed to sell it to the council for the same price. The deed was signed over in January 1946, and preparations immediately commenced to open the Camp for its first summer camp season ever, with Roland Deneault as Camp Director, in summer of the same year. Cachalot Council&#x27;s Order of the Arrow lodge was Agawam Lodge 509 which had the totem of the whale.

===Moby Dick Council===
The Moby Dick Council (also known as Moby Dick Council of Massachusetts and Rhode Island) was formed in 1972 by a merger of the Cachalot Council of Greater New Bedford and the Massasoit Council of Greater Fall River. The two former councils were small, and fell victim to the BSA&#x27;s desire to create larger councils. In 2001, Moby Dick Council suffered a similar fate, and merged with the Narragansett Council of Rhode Island, much to the chagrin of many old-timers of both the smaller councils and the larger Moby Dick Council.

Moby Dick Council originally had two camps: Camp Cachalot was the camp for Cachalot Council, and Camp Noquochoke was the camp for Massasoit Council. Camp Noquochoke was sold due to its smaller size and fewer prospects, and later became a residential neighborhood. Camp Cachalot continued as a weekend and summer resident camp until 2017, when its summer camp operations ceased. Cachalot Scout Reservation was sold to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in June 2022.

Massasoit Council&#x27;s Noquochoke Lodge 124 of the Order of the Arrow merged with Cachalot Council&#x27;s Agawam Lodge 509 to form Neemat Lodge 124.

===Annawon Council===
The Annawon Council was a local council of the Boy Scouts of America headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts. It was one of the few small councils that remained in the area.

In 1930, Annawon Council was organized, but it was not until January 9, 1931, that it was incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts, and legally established as of April 20, 1933. At the time of organization, the Council included the communities of Attleboro, Mansfield, Norton, Taunton, Raynham, and Berkley. William Lee Abbott was appointed Scout Executive and secretary. Dr. Joseph L. Murphy of Taunton was the first Council president, Annawon was one of the last Councils in Massachusetts to be organized. In 1916 the first Scouting charters in Massachusetts were granted to the Fall River and the Fairhaven-New Bedford Councils. Annawon Council was incorporated in 1931. The state of Massachusetts required that both Fall River and Fairhaven-New Bedford council recharter under the articles of incorporation, at that time Fall River Council became known as the Massasoit Council and Fairhaven-New Bedford Council became known as the Cachalot Council.

During 1932, first serious consideration was given a Council-owned camp site for Annawon Scouts. Although considerable thought was given to a site on Lake Mashpee on Cape Cod, the Council reneged on a thirty-day option to buy the property. During the summer of 1932 the invitation of Old Colony Council to camp with them at Camp Childs on Morey&#x27;s Pond was accepted. on October 1, 1932, as a result of the permission of Mr. Clement Jeffers of Attleboro, a camp site for weekend camping was dedicated as Camp Jeffers. During the summer of 1933, the Scouts camped on Greenwood Lake, West Mansfield, at Camp Annawon. This was the first year that a camp existed, the site was known as Camp Finberg, it was a YMCA camp. After considerable study in 1934, the Council purchased 25 Acres on Darby Pond in Plymouth for use as a camp site. The site was known as &quot;Camp King&quot; and was purchased from Phillip Cole for $2,500.00. From July 15 to August 19, Scouts camped on the shore of Darby Pond at Camp Annawon. The original entrance road was off of Plymouth street just off of Carver St (Route 44). It crossed over the cranberry dam below the present BB Range. On June 24, 1935, William A. Collins of Norwich, Connecticut and a graduate of MIT was appointed Scout Executive. He immediately went into camp to direct the Council Camp, which was officially named Camp Norse for the first time. That year the boy week count rose to 165.

In 1940 the land north of the original property of 25 acres was purchased for $300.00, it included an abandoned house in a large field. This field became the ball field. A new entrance road into camp was built off of Partings way road. It was later enlarged by the National Guard Army Corps of Engineers. In 1950 Ellis Brewster from the Plymouth Cordage Company donated 100 acres to Annawon council to increase the size of Camp Norse. That same year, the shallow well was replaced with a deeper well and then was enclosed in a block house through a grant from the George Magee Memorial Fund. In 1960 the camp received a bronze bell, dated 1891. Howard Fowler, Editor of The Mansfield News and former Council President, was instrumental in procuring the bell from the Mansfield Fire Department. It came from an old firehouse on West Church St In Mansfield.

Camp Norse was the sole camp of the council located at 112 Parting Ways Rd. Kingston, MA. In 2014, it was announced that Annawon Council would be merging with a neighboring council. In the spring of 2015, Annawon Council&#x27;s executive committee announced it would be starting merger talks with Narragansett Council headquartered in East Providence, Rhode Island. The council formally merged in September 2015. Prior to merging, the council was divided into the following districts serving 11 communities in Bristol and Plymouth counties:
*Angle Tree District: North Attleboro, MA, Attleboro, MA, Norton, MA, Mansfield, MA
*Sachem District: Dighton, MA, Berkley, MA, Taunton, MA, Raynham, MA, Middleboro, MA, Carver, MA, Lakeville, MA

In June 1941, Tulpe Lodge, Order of the Arrow was approved by the executive board. On August 2, 1943, the council applied for and received a charter for their new Order of the Arrow Lodge, and Tulpe Lodge was official. The turtle shell symbol came from the turtles from Camp Norse. Apparently it was custom at the time to hollow out a turtle shell and use it as a neckerchief slide. There is no chapter system in use for the two districts of the lodge/council. Tulpe has hosted three conclaves at Camp Norse for Area 1C, and Section NE-1B. The name Tulpe remained in the Narragansett Council merger.

===South East Camping Association=== 
In 1993 Camp Norse officially became Camp Norse Cub World and was no longer used for the summer camp for the Scout Troops but rather was used by Cub Scouts through the South East Camping Association (SEMCA). This was a North East Region BSA sanctioned program that included the Cape Cod and Islands Council, Annawon Council, and the Moby Dick Council. This effort was designed to use the resources available in these three councils. Troop camping for all three Councils was to be at Camp Cachalot which was owned by the Moby Dick Council. The Cub Scout summer camp would be at Camp Norse, and the Boy Scout High Adventure summer camp, would be at Camp Greenough on Cape Cod.

===The Original Narragansett Council 1917-2001===
The Narragansett Council, Boy Scouts of America is part of a worldwide Scouting movement with over 15 million members in one hundred countries. Boy Scouting began in England in 1907 when the British military hero, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, organized the first Boy Scout camp. In 1908, he published Scouting for Boys and formed what would become the British Boy Scout Association.

As a result of a &quot;good turn&quot; performed by an English Scout in London for Chicago publisher William D. Boyce, Scouting came to America. The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated in 1910 and chartered by Congress on June 15, 1916.

Scouting in Rhode Island began as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts which was first organized as a voluntary association on September 6, 1910. On April 13, 1911, it was chartered under state laws for the purpose of giving boys of Rhode Island an organization in which they could be formed into groups that mirrored the newly formed national Boy Scout Program. From 1910 to 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts established groups (troops) throughout Rhode Island, except in Newport, Blackstone Valley and Woonsocket. In these locations, troops were organized and affiliated with the National Council Boy Scouts of America.

In 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts ‘merged’ with the National movement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America was formed to take over the operation of the Scouting Program and supervision of troops. The National Council Boy Scouts of America recognized the date of the council&#x27;s organization as September 6, 1910, and granted all members back service to that date. The National Council Boy Scouts of America also agreed that the Rhode Island Boy Scouts could maintain its corporate identity so that it could continue to receive bequests, hold funds and properties and acquire other funds and properties in the future; thus, the formation of Rhode Island Boy Scouts as a Trustee organization.

In 1929 and 1930, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America merged with the Newport County Council, the Pawtucket-Central Falls Council and the Woonsocket Council to form the Narragansett Council.

The Boy Scouts of America Narragansett County Scout Center Building in Providence, Rhode Island, dates from this time. It was built 1965 to the design of Providence architect D. Thomas Russillo.

The Order of the Arrow Lodge was the Wincheck Lodge 534 which had the totem of the bear and specifically served Yawgoog Scout Reservation. It was formed in the 1950s from Yawgoog&#x27;s honor society, The Wincheck Indians, when the Order of the Arrow became growing in national popularity.

=== Narragansett Council 2002-2015===
On July 1, 2001, the Moby Dick Council headquartered in New Bedford, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in Providence, Rhode Island, adding 17 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the 6 cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The Council serves almost 26,000 registered youth members and Learning for Life participants and supports in excess of 5,000 registered adult volunteers. The Narragansett Council operates two Scout Shops/Service Centers (one in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, RI and one in the Swansea Mall in Swansea, MA) and owned and operated eight great camps: Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, RI, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, MA, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Cachalot Scout Reservation in Carver, MA, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, RI, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, RI. Administrative functions are housed at 10 Risho Avenue in East Providence, RI.

The Order of the Arrow Lodge is Abnaki Lodge 102 with the totem of a bear and a peace pipe.

Narragansett Council began merger talks with Annawon Council based in Norton, MA in 2015 and officially merged on September 10, 2015, under the name Narragansett Council.

===The modern Narragansett Council===
On September 10, 2015, the Annawon Council headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in East Providence, Rhode Island, adding 11 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the 62 cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The newly merged operation, which will take the name of the Narragansett Council, includes all of Rhode Island, 34 communities in Massachusetts and 1 in Connecticut, and boasts nearly 14,000 Scouts, the largest in National Service Territory 11. The Narragansett Council&#x27;s main headquarters remain at its current location in Cranston. The Narragansett Council operates one Scout Shop/Service Center (in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, RI) and operates eight camps: Camp Norse in Kingston, MA, Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, RI, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, MA, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, RI, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, RI. Administrative functions are housed Camp Champlin located in Cranston, RI

The Order of the Arrow lodge of the new council is Tulpe Lodge 102 with the totem of the turtle, formed from a merger of Narragansett Council&#x27;s Abnaki Lodge 102 and Annawon Council&#x27;s Tulpe Lodge 245.

===Cachalot Scout Reservation===
The Narragansett Council announced in August 2021 that its Executive Board would pursue a sale of Camp Cachalot, located in Plymouth and Wareham, Massachusetts. Proceeds of the sale would comprise part of the Council’s $6.45 million contribution to a trust, to be established in connection with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of the Boy Scouts of America, to compensate survivors of past abuse in Scouting. The Council later announced in May 2022 that it had reached agreement to sell Camp Cachalot to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The sale to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through its Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, was completed on June 17, 2022.

===Yawgoog Scout Reservation===

Yawgoog Scout Reservation is a reservation for Scouting located in Rockville, Rhode Island and operated by the Narragansett Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Founded in 1916, Yawgoog is the fourth oldest continuously run Scout camp in the United States.
 It runs an eight-week summer camping program every summer where Boy Scouts stay for a week with their troops. The Reservation is divided into three camps: Camps Three Point, Medicine Bow, and Sandy Beach. Generally each camp offers the same programs and experiences.

== Career ==

=== 1989–2002: Child acting and early music releases ===

In 1989, Raven-Symoné auditioned for a role in the Bill Cosby movie, &quot;Ghost Dad&quot;. At the age of three, she was considered too young for the role, but Cosby liked her so much that he found a role for her on his show, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, as his step-granddaughter Olivia. She made her debut in the premiere episode of the show&#x27;s sixth season and remained until the series finale in 1992. She then appeared as the younger version of Halle Berry&#x27;s starring character, a headstrong biracial enslaved woman, in the TV movie &quot;Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen&quot;.

In 1996, Raven-Symoné and her father founded RayBlaze Records, in which she signed a distribution deal with Crash Records for her second album &quot;Undeniable&quot;, which was released in May 1999. The album sold over 2,000 in US. The album yielded one single: a cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;With a Child&#x27;s Heart&quot;. To support &quot;Undeniable&quot;, she went on tour as the opening act for Jive artist &#x27;N Sync&#x27;s &quot;The &#x27;N Sync Tour&quot; in 1998/1999.

=== 2003–2007: &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, and &quot;This Is My Time&quot; ===
In 2001, Raven-Symoné auditioned for a role on an upcoming series for the Disney Channel titled &quot;Absolutely Psychic&quot;, about a teenager with psychic abilities. She auditioned for the recurring role of Chelsea Daniels, but her role was changed to the lead character Raven Baxter and the series name changed to &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;. The series debuted on January 17, 2003 and ended on November 10, 2007, becoming the channel&#x27;s highest-rated and longest-running series at 100 episodes (until it was surpassed by &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; in October 2011). It spawned a franchise including soundtracks, dolls, episode DVDs, and video games. &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was nominated for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program during the 2005 and 2007 Emmy Awards.

<text>Dantrolene sodium, sold under the brand name Dantrium among others, is a postsynaptic muscle relaxant that lessens excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. It achieves this by inhibiting Ca2+ ions release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores by antagonizing ryanodine receptors. It is the primary drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia, a rare, life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia or drugs. It is also used in the management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, muscle spasticity (e.g. after strokes, in paraplegia, cerebral palsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis), and poisoning by 2,4-dinitrophenol or by the related compounds dinoseb and dinoterb.

The most frequently occurring side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea.

It is marketed by Par Pharmaceuticals LLC as Dantrium (in North America) and by Norgine BV as Dantrium, Dantamacrin, or Dantrolen (in Europe). A hospital is recommended to keep a minimum stock of 36 dantrolene vials totaling 720 mg, sufficient for a 70-kg person.

==Contraindications==
Oral dantrolene is contraindicated for
* patients with active hepatic disease
* patients in whom spasticity is utilized to maintain upright posture and balance
* patients with a hypersensitivity to dantrolene

There are no contraindications for intravenous dantrolene used for prophylaxis or management of malignant hyperthermia.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
If needed in pregnancy, adequate human studies are lacking, therefore the drug should be given in pregnant women only if clearly indicated. It may cause hypotonia in the newborn if given closely before delivery.

== Interactions ==
Dantrolene may interact with the following drugs:
* Calcium channel blockers of the diltiazem/verapamil type: Intravenous treatment with dantrolene and concomitant calcium channel blocker treatment may lead to severe cardiovascular collapse, abnormal heart rhythms, myocardial depressions, and high blood potassium.
* Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, such as vecuronium bromide: Neuromuscular blockade is potentiated.
* CNS depressants: Sedative action is potentiated. Benzodiazepines may also cause additive muscle weakness.
* Combined oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy with estrogens may enhance liver toxicity of dantrolene, particularly in women over 35 years of age.

==Pharmacology==
Dantrolene depresses excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by acting as a receptor antagonist to the ryanodine receptor, and decreasing free intracellular calcium concentration.

==Chemistry==
Chemically it is a hydantoin derivative, but does not exhibit antiepileptic activity like other hydantoin derivates such as phenytoin.

The poor water solubility of dantrolene leads to certain difficulties in its use. A more water-soluble analog of dantrolene, azumolene, is under development for similar indications. Azumolene has a bromine residue instead of the nitro group found in dantrolene, and is 30 times more water-soluble.

===Synthesis===
The original patent synthesis started with &quot;para&quot;-nitroaniline which undergoes diazotization followed by a copper(II) chloride catalyzed arylation with furfural (essentially a modified Meerwein arylation). This then reacts with 1-aminohydantoin to form the final product.

==History==
Dantrolene was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, as one of several hydantoin derivatives proposed as a new class of muscle relaxant. Dantrolene underwent extensive further development, and its action on skeletal muscle was described in detail in 1973.

Dantrolene was widely used in the management of spasticity before its efficacy in treating malignant hyperthermia was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a landmark 1975 article published in the &quot;British Journal of Anaesthesia&quot;. Harrison experimentally induced malignant hyperthermia with halothane anesthesia in genetically susceptible pigs, and obtained an 87.5% survival rate, where seven of his eight experiments survived after intravenous administration of dantrolene. The efficacy of dantrolene in humans was later confirmed in a large, multicenter study published in 1982, and confirmed epidemiologically in 1993. Before dantrolene, the only available treatment for malignant hyperthermia was procaine, which was associated with a 60% mortality rate in animal models.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
In March 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Agilus, intended for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia in combination with adequate support measures. The applicant for this medicinal product is Norgine B.V. In the formulation of Agilus, the mannitol and sodium hydroxide have been replaced with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and Macrogol 3350 to shorten the preparation time and improve the ease of use. It was designated an orphan drug. Dantrolene sodium, hemiheptahydrate (Agilus) was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2024.
