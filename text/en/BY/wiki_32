<text>Starved Rock State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Illinois, characterized by the many canyons within its . Located just southeast of the village of Utica, in Deer Park Township, LaSalle County, Illinois, along the south bank of the Illinois River, the park hosts over two million visitors annually, the most for any Illinois state park.

A flood from a melting glacier, known as the Kankakee Torrent, which took place approximately 14,000–19,000 years ago led to the topography of the site and its exposed rock canyons. Diverse forest plant life exists in the park and the area supports several wild animal species. Of particular interest has been sport fishing species.

Before European contact, the area was home to Native Americans, particularly the Kaskaskia who lived in the Grand Village of the Illinois across the river. Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette were the first Europeans recorded as exploring the region, and by 1683, the French had established Fort St. Louis on the large sandstone butte overlooking the river, they called &quot;Le Rocher&quot; (the Rock). Later after the French had moved on, according to a local legend, a group of Native Americans of the Illinois Confederation (also called Illiniwek or Illini) pursued by the Ottawa and Potawatomi fled to the butte in the late 18th century. In the legend, around 1769 the Ottawa and Potawatomi besieged the butte until all of the Illiniwek had starved, and the butte became known as &quot;Starved Rock&quot;.

In the late 19th century, parkland around &#x27;Starved Rock&#x27; was developed as a vacation resort. The resort was acquired by the State of Illinois in 1911 for a state park, which it remains today. Facilities in the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, which have also gained historic designation. The Rock was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The park region has been the subject of several archeological studies concerning both native and European settlements, and various other archeological sites associated with the park were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

==Geology==

A catastrophic flood known as the Kankakee Torrent, which took place somewhere between 14,000 and 17,000 years ago, before humans occupied the area, helped create the park&#x27;s signature geology and features, which are very unusual for the central plains.

The park is on the south bank of the Illinois River, a major tributary of the Mississippi River, between the Fox and Vermilion Rivers. The Vermilion created large sandbars at the junction of the Illinois, preventing practical navigation farther upriver. Rapids were found at the base of the butte before the construction of the Starved Rock Lock and Dam.

Starved Rock is known for its outcrops of St. Peter Sandstone. The sandstone, typically buried, is exposed in this area due to an anticline, a convex fold in underlying strata. This creates canyons and cliffs when streams cut across the anticline. The sandstone is pure and poorly cemented, making it workable with a pick or shovel. A similar geologic feature is found by near the Rock River between Dixon and Oregon, Illinois within Castle Rock State Park.

== History ==

=== Early settlements ===
Clovis points unearthed in the park indicate occupation by people of the Clovis Culture, which was widespread by about 11,000 BC. Clovis hunters specialized in hunting the large Pleistocene mammals, but a variety of other plants and animals were also exploited. Archeological surveys have located Archaic period (8000 – 2000 BC) settlements along the Illinois River. These prehistoric indigenous peoples thrived by foraging and hunting a variety of wild foods; Havana Hopewell settlers during the Woodland period (1000 BC – 1000 AD) built earthwork mounds. They also made pottery and domesticated plants.

The growth of agriculture and maize surpluses supported the development of the complex Mississippian culture. Its peoples established permanent settlements in the Mississippi, Illinois, and Ohio river valleys. They harvested maize, beans, and pumpkins, and were noted for their copper ornaments. The first interaction with other tribes occurred during this period: artifacts from the major regional chiefdom and urban complex of Cahokia, at present-day Collinsville, Illinois, have been recovered at Illinois River sites.

The earliest group of inhabitants recorded by the colonial French in the region were the historical Kaskaskia, whose large settlement on the north side of the Illinois River was known as the Grand Village of the Illinois. The Kaskaskia were members of the Illinois Confederation, who inhabited the region in the 16th through the 18th centuries. They lived in wigwams made of lightweight material. The natives could easily dismantle these structures when they traveled to hunt bison twice a year. The women gathered tubers from nearby swamps as a secondary source of food. Small bands of aggressive Iroquois settlers arrived in northern Illinois in 1660 in search of new hunting grounds for beaver, stimulating intertribal warfare. The Kaskaskia struggled with the Iroquois, who were armed with guns seized from or traded by Europeans in the eastern United States.

===French exploration and mission===

In 1673 Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette were the first known Europeans to explore the northern portion of the Mississippi River. On their return, they navigated the Illinois River, which they found to be a convenient route to Lake Michigan. Along the river, they found seventy-three cabins in the Grand Village, whose population rapidly expanded in the next several years. Marquette returned to the village in 1675 to set up the Mission of the Immaculate Conception, the first Christian mission in modern-day Illinois. Marquette was joined by fellow Jesuit priest Claude-Jean Allouez in 1677. By 1680, the Grand Village was home to several hundred native cabins and a large population.

In 1680 the Iroquois temporarily drove the Kaskaskia out of the settlement during the Beaver Wars, as they were trying to expand their hunting territory. With an increase in French settlers in the area, the Kaskaskia returned by 1683. The French were able to provide the Kaskaskia with guns in exchange for other goods, which they used for defense against the powerful Iroquois, already armed by the English.
===Fort St. Louis du Rocher===

French explorers led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henry de Tonty built Fort St. Louis on the large butte by the river in the winter of 1682. Called &quot;Le Rocher&quot;, the butte provided an advantageous position for the fort above the Illinois River. A wooden palisade was the only form of defense that La Salle used in securing the site. Inside the fort were a few wooden houses and native shelters. The French intended St. Louis to be the first of several forts to defend against English incursions and keep their settlements confined to the East Coast. Accompanying the French to the region were allied members of several native tribes from eastern areas, who integrated with the Kaskaskia: the Miami, Shawnee, and Mahican. The tribes established a new settlement at the base of the butte at a site now known as Hotel Plaza. After La Salle&#x27;s five year monopoly ended, Governor Joseph-Antoine de La Barre wished to obtain Fort St. Louis along with Fort Frontenac for himself. By orders of the governor, traders and his officers were escorted to Illinois. On August 11, 1683, Prudhomme obtained approximately one and three quarters of a mile of the north portage shore.

During the French and Indian Wars, the French used the fort as a refuge against attacks by the Iroquois, who were allied with the British. The Iroquois forced the settlers, then commanded by Henri de Tonty, to abandon the fort in 1691. De Tonty reorganized the settlers and constructed Fort Pimiteoui in modern-day Peoria.

French troops commanded by Pierre Deliette may have occupied Fort St. Louis from 1714 to 1718; Deliette&#x27;s jurisdiction over the region ended when the territory was transferred from Canada to Louisiana. Fur trappers and traders used the fort periodically in the early 18th century until it became too dilapidated. No surface remains of the fort are found at the site today.

===&quot;Starved Rock&quot;===

The region was periodically occupied by a variety of native tribes who were forced westward by the expansion of European settlements and the Beaver Wars. These included the Potawatomi and others.

There are various local legends about how Starved Rock got its name. The most popular is a tale of revenge for the assassination of Ottawa leader Pontiac, who was killed in Cahokia on April 20, 1769, by an Illinois Confederation warrior. According to the legend, the Ottawa, along with their allies the Potawatomi, avenged Pontiac&#x27;s death by attacking a band of Illiniwek along the Illinois River. The Illiniwek climbed to the butte to seek refuge, but their pursuers besieged the rock until the tribe starved to death, thereby giving the place the name &quot;Starved Rock&quot;. The legend sometimes maintains, falsely, that this resulted in the complete extermination of the Illiniwek. Apart from oral history, there is no historical evidence that the siege happened. An early written report of the legend was related by Henry Schoolcraft in 1825.

In 1919 Edgar Lee Masters, author of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, wrote a poem titled &quot;Starved Rock&quot; in which he voiced a dramatic elegy for the Illini tribe whose tragic death thus gave rise to the name of the dramatic butte overlooking the Illinois River. (Macmillan Company, N.Y., 1919.)

===Resort and state park===

Daniel Hitt purchased the land that is today occupied by Starved Rock State Park from the United States Government in 1835 for $85 as compensation for his tenure in the U.S. Army. He sold the land in 1890 to Ferdinand Walther for $15,000. Recognizing the potential for developing the land as a resort, Walther constructed the Starved Rock Hotel and a natural pool near the base of Starved Rock, as well as a concession stand and dance hall. The French and Native American heritage of the region also drew visitors to the site. Walthers set up a variety of walkable trails and harbored small boats near the hotel that made trips along the Illinois River. Visitors could also visit Deer Park (modern-day Matthiessen State Park) a few miles to the south.

With the growth of competitive sites, Walther struggled to keep the complex economically stable. In 1911, he sold the land to the Illinois State Parks Commission for $146,000. The Commission was initially headquartered at Starved Rock State Park after the land was acquired. The state initially acquired 898 acres and opened Starved Rock State Park as a public facility in 1912.

During its early years, Starved Rock State Park was directly accessible only by railroad. Visitors had reached Starved Rock by rail and ferry since at least 1904, while the property was still a Walther-run resort. Between 1904 and 1908 more than 160,000 people used the ferry that connected Starved Rock to the electric railway line. In 1912, the year the park was opened to the public, attendance was 75,000. By the 1930s other state parks were opened in Illinois but Starved Rock State Park remained the most extensively used park in the system.
Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal legislation in the 1930s called for the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to provide jobs for young men. The focus of this group was to preserve natural areas in the rural United States. CCC Camp 614 was deployed to Starved Rock State Park from the Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri. Unlike most CCC groups in the nation, Camp 614 included African Americans. The group, composed of roughly 200 men, constructed trails, shelters, and benches throughout the park. In 1933, the group was joined by Camp 1609 from Fort Sheridan via Readstown, Wisconsin. Camp 1609 constructed the Starved Rock Lodge, several surrounding log cabins, and a large parking lot. The lodge was particularly noted for its elegant fireplaces, constructed from limestone imported from Joliet. Men from camps 614 and 1609 lay more than 25 miles of trails. Camp 614 was eventually reassigned to Illini National Forest. The men were replaced by those of Camp 2601 from Fort Sheridan in 1934. Camp 2601 constructed the Wildcat Canyon bridge, among others.

When Illinois Route 71 was opened in 1942, it allowed easy automotive access from Chicago. Starved Rock was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. That same year, three women from the Chicago suburbs were brutally murdered in the park. Chester Weger was convicted of the murders and became Illinois longest-serving inmate. The murders were the subject of docuseries on HBO Max.

The butte has eroded due to foot traffic since the park was developed. To curb this, the Illinois Young Adult Conservation Corps installed a platform and staircase on the landmark in 1981. The CCC-era Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins were added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1985. The Illinois Bureau of Tourism listed Starved Rock State Park as one of the &quot;Seven Wonders of Illinois&quot; in 2007. 2.1 million people visited the park in 2010.
== Archaeological sites and research ==

===Starved Rock===
The summit of Starved Rock was the site of archeological excavations in 1947–1949 by archaeologists from the Illinois State Museum and the University of Chicago. The research was continued in 1950 by an archaeologist from State Department of Public Works and Buildings who had joined the project the year before. Archaeologists from the University of Illinois Chicago restarted testing at the site for a season in 1974, and later an archaeologist from Illinois State University continued testing. The 1947–1950 excavations provided the &quot;greater part of the knowledge of the archaeology of Starved Rock&quot;.

===Corbin Farm===
The Corbin Farm Site is a site of archaeological significance located within the park. Today, the site is part of a picnic area. Field investigations were done in 1992 and 1994 and pottery analysis determined that the site was primarily settled during the Late Woodland Period, during the second half of the First Millennium. The site, also known as the Salt Well Site, was the location of a farmstead from c. 1870–1940. Corbin Farm Site covers nearly 69,000 m2 and is located 10 m south of the Illinois River. Corbin Farm Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1998, as part of the Archaeological Sites of Starved Rock Multiple Property Submission.

===Hotel Plaza===
Hotel Plaza Site is another archaeological site in the park that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Hotel Plaza was listed under the same Multiple Property Submission as Corbin Farm on June 18, 1998. Excavations in the 1940s, 1970s and 1990s revealed the presence of humans during several different cultural periods in North American history including, Paleo-Indian, Historic Native American, Archaic and Woodland. It is believed that Hotel Plaza was also the site of a large Native American village that helped support early French explorers in the region during the 17th and 18th centuries. In more modern historic times the site was the location of a hotel within the state park.

===Little Beaver===
The Little Beaver Site is an archaeological site that has been the location of multiple settlements from various periods including, Archaic, Early Woodland, Middle Woodland and Upper Mississippian. Based on artifacts recovered the primary period of occupation at Little Beaver was Middle Woodland. Little Beaver is a village and mound site and contains two groups of mounds. In total, there are 13 mounds within the 98,000 m2 Little Beaver Site. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1998, as part of the Archaeological Sites of Starved Rock State Park Multiple Property Submission.

===Shaky Shelter===

Shaky Shelter Site is the location of a prehistoric rock shelter site at the base of the sandstone bluff within the state park&#x27;s Kaskaskia Canyon. In 1991 subsurface tests of the 183 m2 shelter site were made and determined that evidence existed only for occupation by Upper Mississippian groups. Shaky Shelter Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on the same date, June 18, 1998, and as part of the same Multiple Property Submission as the Corbin Farm, Hotel Plaza and Little Beaver sites.

===Other sites===
Besides the five sites – Starved Rock, Corbin Farm, Hotel Plaza, Little Beaver, and Shaky Shelter – entered on the National Register of Historic Places, there are several other sites of archaeological significance found within the park. Open-air occupation sites are archaeological sites that occur within open areas, such as floodplains or uplands. There are 21 open-air occupation sites within Starved Rock State Park, as of 1998 four of those had been subject to subsurface examination. Those sites include: Hotel Plaza Site, Starved Rock Site, Simonson Site, and Devil&#x27;s Nose Site.

Rock shelters, such as the one found at the Shaky Shelter Site, are areas used by human inhabitants that occur in rock overhangs that offer a moderate level of protection against the elements. By 1998 14 occupied rock shelter sites had been identified within the state park. At the time of Shaky Shelter&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places listing it was the only rock shelter in the park determined to have undisturbed prehistoric features of archaeological significance.

At the time of the 1998 addition of the Corbin Farm and Little Beaver sites to the National Register, it had been determined that there were three &quot;village and mound&quot; sites within the park. Besides Corbin Farm and Little Beaver, the Simonson site, an open-air occupation site, is also considered a village and mound site. Simonson Site has faced significant alterations over the years

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora===
Approximately 150 types of plants grow at Starved Rock State Park. On the sandstone cliffs of Starved Rock State Park white pine, Canada yew and northern white cedar are found; these plants are more commonly found further north. On the surfaces of the canyons and cliffs, where it is cooler, other plants are found, examples include: harebell, reindeer lichen, and mountain holly. A non-vascular plant, liverwort, is also found on the sandstone surfaces throughout Starved Rock State Park. The Indian cucumber root, a rare lily in Illinois, was found in the park in 1939. A lady&#x27;s slipper orchid has also been found in the park, it, like other orchids, is susceptible to invasive plant species, and changes in habitat.

===Fauna===
The stretch of the Illinois River that travels through the park contains several types of game fish that can be caught by anglers. These species include: catfish, bullhead, white bass, sauger, walleye, carp and crappie. However, the recent appearance of the invasive silver carp or Asian carp has greatly affected native fish populations and has likely spurred their decline. No official studies have been undertaken yet to confirm this, but local anglers have reported large catches of silver carp absent any native species.

== Climate ==

Northern Illinois has a humid continental climate, featuring mild summers and cold winters capable of producing snow storms. The highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1936, and the record low was in 1985. January is the coldest month at the park, July is the warmest, and June is the wettest. Starved Rock State Park averages of precipitation.
== Recreation ==

There are over of hiking trails in Starved Rock State Park. The trail system received the National Recreation Trail designation in 1981. There are 18 deep canyons in the park; French, LaSalle, Ottawa and St. Louis Canyons feature the more long-lasting waterfalls at Starved Rock. A trail along the river offers scenic views from attractions such as Lover&#x27;s Leap Overlook, Eagle Cliff Overlook and Beehive Overlook. Camping, boating and fishing are among the other activities offered in the park. There are 133 campsites at Starved Rock State Park, of which 100 can be reserved. There are also horseback riding trails at Starved Rock on the far western side of the park.
From December through February bald eagles can be viewed at the park, either fishing below the Starved Rock Dam, where turbulent waters stay unfrozen during the cold winter months or roosting on the Leopold or Plum Island. The Starved Rock State Park Visitor Center loans out binoculars to aspiring birders in exchange for the birder&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license. During the winter, sports such as ice skating, tobogganing, cross-country skiing and sledding are allowed in parts of the park. Snowmobiling is not allowed at Starved Rock State Park. Waterfalls become constantly changing ice falls during the winter as well. 14 of 18 waterfalls transform into scenic ice falls, with those at LaSalle, French, St. Louis, Tonty, Wildcat, Hennepin, Ottawa and Kaskaskia Canyons being especially scenic. Ice climbing is another winter activity allowed in select canyons.

== Lodge and cabins ==


===History===
Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins were built from 1933 to 1939 by the Depression-Era Civilian Conservation Corps. The lodge and cabins originally cost between $200,000 and $300,000 to build. Another $200,000 was spent on the construction of a 48-room hotel wing after the original construction was completed. Other alterations were completed between 1986 and 1988 when a major renovation added amenities such as a heated swimming pool and a 30-room addition to the hotel. The Lodge and Cabins are operated as the Starved Rock Lodge and Conference Center.

===Architecture===
The Starved Rock Lodge and Cabins were designed by Joseph F. Booton and constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The lodge has a central lounge, known as the Great Room, and hotel wings and a dining room wing. On its exterior, the lodge is primarily constructed of stone, unhewed logs, clapboard and wood shingles. Booton&#x27;s design intended to impress upon visitors the idea of a &quot;woodsy retreat.&quot; This is seen in the way he designed round log purlins whose unevenly hewn ends extend beyond the lodge&#x27;s eaves. Surrounding the lodge are 12 cabins. Two large cabins are sited just west of the lodge while the other ten are situated across a steep ravine, known as Fox Canyon, from the lodge. The cabins are constructed of unhewn logs with random corner notches and sit in heavily wooded areas meant to evoke a &quot;camping in the woods&quot; feeling. The 12 cabins and the lodge cover an area of . Despite the changes through modernization the lodge still retains much of the charm its architect intended.

===Historic significance===
Starved Rock State Park&#x27;s Lodge and Cabins were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1985, as part of the Illinois State Park Lodges and Cabins Thematic Resources Multiple Property Submission. By the National Register&#x27;s criteria the Lodge and Cabins are considered significant in the areas of architecture and entertainment/recreation. The size of the lodge and the land area the cabins cover are both nearly unrivaled in the Illinois state park system; only Pere Marquette State Park&#x27;s Lodge and Cabins come close.

==Lock and dam==
Starved Rock Lock and Dam, also known as Lock and Dam No. 6, is a lock and dam facility managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along the Illinois River. It is part of the Illinois Waterway and was constructed between 1926 and 1933. The lock and dam was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Starved Rock Lock and Dam Historic District in 2004.

==In popular culture==
The ending scene of the 1989 fantasy drama movie &quot;Prancer&quot; was filmed inside the park at Devil&#x27;s Nose, and Park Conservation later fined the movie company $1,800 for chopping down a 125-year-old tree. Due to the incident, no further motion picture production has been allowed in the park.

<text>Neil Antony Back MBE (born 16 January 1969) is a former international rugby union footballer for England and the British &amp; Irish Lions who also played for Nottingham RFC, Leicester Tigers, and captained both England and Leicester during his career.

Following World Cup victory with England in 2003, he took on the role of Player/Defensive Coach for Leicester Tigers until he retired, following an illustrious 17-year first class playing career. One of his final games saw him become the oldest test British Lion in the history of the game, in the first test match verses New Zealand, on the 2005 tour.

During his international career he played in three World Cups, 1995, 1999, and 2003, where he was an integral part of the 2003 World Cup winning side. He also went on three Lions tours: the victorious tour to South Africa in 1997, and to Australia in 2001 and New Zealand in 2005. He earned 66 caps for England, captaining them to victory four times, and scored 16 tries and 1 drop goal (the only England forward to do so in a test match in the history of the game). He played as an open-side flanker. He is married to Alison, with whom he has a daughter, Olivia, who joined him on the winning podium in 2003, and a son, Finley.

Retirement from playing allowed him to concentrate on his future, seeing him continue his role as Assistant Coach at Leicester Tigers whilst gaining all of the RFU Coaching Awards; he now has over a decade of coaching experience.

== Youth ==
Back was born in Coventry, where he attended The Woodlands School between September 1980 and July 1987. During his time at the school, he also played football, cricket, basketball, athletics and cross country before opting to strive to gain international status in rugby union. Back learnt his trade at junior clubs in Coventry, Earlsdon RFC and Barker&#x27;s Butts RFC, and went on to represent England at Schools, Colts, U21 and Saxons levels.

==Playing career==
He made his full England debut against Scotland in 1994. He began his senior playing career in 1988 for Nottingham.

In 1990 he joined Leicester Tigers and remained there for the next 18 years as a player and coach, gaining 339 caps and scoring a club record (for a forward) 125 tries.

Despite impressive performances between 1990 and 1995, he was not selected for England regularly, picking up only 7 caps during this period, on the basis that he was considered too small by some selectors, at only and .

His most controversial moment came in Leicester&#x27;s 1996 Pilkington Cup final defeat against Bath. As the final whistle was blown, Back pushed referee Steve Lander to the ground. Back maintained that he had mistaken Lander for Bath back-row (and future England head coach) Andy Robinson. Back was given a six-month ban from the game, but from a dark moment blazed back even fitter, fresher and more focused than he had ever been following a 20-week, 6 days a week, twice a day torturous training schedule.

This led to a call-up to the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa, where he played in the final two Test Matches, the second where the Series was won. He subsequently became an important part of Clive Woodward&#x27;s England team, forming the famous back-row unit with Richard Hill and Lawrence Dallaglio. He was also one of five Tigers players selected for his 2nd Lions Tour 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia picking up another two Test caps and then went on to become the oldest Test Lion in history on his 3rd and final Tour to NZ in 2005 picking up his 5th Test cap in the 1st Test.

Back was a master of controlling the ball at the back of a rolling maul and in 1999 he was Leicester&#x27;s top try scorer with 16 tries as Tigers often kicked penalties to touch for lineouts near to the opposition&#x27;s try line, won the subsequent lineout and the pack drove Back over to score.

He scored a try in the 2001 Heineken Cup Final in which Leicester beat Stade Français by 34–30, and won the lineout which led to Austin Healey&#x27;s break and Leon Lloyd&#x27;s winning try.

In the 2002 Heineken Cup Final he once again aroused major controversy. Tigers were leading Munster 15–9 in the final minutes of the match, and Munster had a scrum well inside the Leicester 22. With the referee distracted on the other side of the scrum, Back knocked the ball illegally from Munster scrum-half Peter Stringer&#x27;s hands before the put-in and Leicester won possession and cleared the ball. The press and Munster fans were up in arms, though Munster&#x27;s players sportingly conceded that gamesmanship was an integral part of the game.

He captained England on four occasions when Martin Johnson was injured. He took over the captaincy of Leicester for the 2003/4 season, but Johnson was reinstated as captain after the coaching coup that saw Dean Richards sacked as coach and replaced by John Wells, and Back was given a role as a Player/Defence Coach.

Back was one of England&#x27;s outstanding players during the 2003 Rugby World Cup, scoring two tries along the way and played his last game for England in their victory over Australia in World Cup Final 2003. He won a total of 66 caps (4 as captain), scored 16 tries and 1 drop goal (the only English forward to do so in the history of the game) and played in 3 World Cups (1995, 1999 &amp; 2003).

==Coaching career==
Back&#x27;s coaching career started at Leicester Tigers following England&#x27;s World Cup success in 2003, where he became their player/defensive coach. When he finally retired from playing after the Lions&#x27; tour of New Zealand in 2005, he continued as Leicester Tigers defensive coach, but to aid his coach development also took on the role of head coach of Leicester Tigers Academy and assistant forwards coach.

On 27 June 2008, Back left his beloved Tigers and signed a 3-year contract with Leeds Carnegie as head coach. In his first year Leeds Carnegie were promoted from the Championship to the Premiership, where they battled to remain against all the odds for the next 2 seasons on a very limited budget.

On 4 July 2011, after turning down a director of Rugby role at a Premiership Club announced that he would instead take on the same role at &#x27;The Rugby Football Club (2011) Ltd&#x27;, formerly known as &#x27;Rugby Lions&#x27; in National League 3 Midlands, while Key became Chief Executive. Several high-quality players joined the new outfit, such as Ben Gollings and Leigh Hinton, which helped the Lions remain unbeaten all season (26 League + 5 Cup games), winning the League, automatic promotion and domestic cup in Back&#x27;s first season.

During June 2011, Back joined Edinburgh Rugby&#x27;s Coaching Team alongside ex-Ireland international scrum half, Michael Bradley and Billy McGinty.

<text>In cryptography, a salt is random data fed as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salting helps defend against attacks that use precomputed tables (e.g. rainbow tables), by vastly growing the size of table needed for a successful attack. It also helps protect passwords that occur multiple times in a database, as a new salt is used for each password instance. Additionally, salting does not place any burden on users. 

Typically, a unique salt is randomly generated for each password. The salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and fed to a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value is then stored with the salt in a database. The salt does not need to be encrypted, because knowing the salt would not help the attacker.

Salting is broadly used in cybersecurity, from Unix system credentials to Internet security.

Salts are related to cryptographic nonces.

== Example ==
Without a salt, identical passwords will map to identical hash values, which could make it easier for a hacker to guess the passwords from their hash value.
Instead, a salt is generated and appended to each password, which causes the resultant hash to output different values for the same original password.

The salt and hash are then stored in the database. To later test if a password a user enters is correct, the same process can be performed on it (appending that user&#x27;s salt to the password and calculating the resultant hash): if the result does not match the stored hash, it could not have been the correct password that was entered.

In practice, a salt is usually generated using a Cryptographically Secure PseudoRandom Number Generator. CSPRNGs are designed to produce unpredictable random numbers which can be alphanumeric. While generally discouraged due to lower security, some systems use timestamps or simple counters as a source of salt. Sometimes, a salt may be generated by combining a random value with additional information, such as a timestamp or user-specific data, to ensure uniqueness across different systems or time periods.

==Common mistakes==

===Salt re-use===
Using the same salt for all passwords is dangerous because a precomputed table which simply accounts for the salt will render the salt useless. 

Generation of precomputed tables for databases with unique salts for every password is not viable because of the computational cost of doing so. But, if a common salt is used for all the entries, creating such a table (that accounts for the salt) then becomes a viable and possibly successful attack.

Because salt re-use can cause users with the same password to have the same hash, cracking a single hash can result in other passwords being compromised too.

===Salt length===

If a salt is too short, an attacker may precompute a table of every possible salt appended to every likely password. Using a long salt ensures such a table would be prohibitively large. 16 bytes (128 bits) or more is generally sufficient to provide a large enough space of possible values, minimizing the risk of collisions (i.e., two different passwords ending up with the same salt).

==Benefits==
To understand the difference between cracking a single password and a set of them, consider a file with users and their hashed passwords. Say the file is unsalted. Then an attacker could pick a string, call it , and then compute . A user whose hash stored in the file is may or may not have password . However, even if is &quot;not&quot; the user&#x27;s actual password, it will be accepted as if it were, because the system can only check passwords by computing the hash of the password entered and comparing it to the hash stored in the file. Thus, each match cracks a user password, and the chance of a match rises with the number of passwords in the file. In contrast, if salts are used, the attacker would have to compute codice_1, compare against entry A, then codice_2, compare against entry B, and so on. This prevents any one attempt from cracking multiple passwords, given that salt re-use is avoided.

Salts also combat the use of precomputed tables for cracking passwords. Such a table might simply map common passwords to their hashes, or it might do something more complex, like store the start and end points of a set of precomputed hash chains. In either case, salting can defend against the use of precomputed tables by lengthening hashes and having them draw from larger character sets, making it less likely that the table covers the resulting hashes. In particular, a precomputed table would need to cover the string rather than simply . 

The modern shadow password system, in which password hashes and other security data are stored in a non-public file, somewhat mitigates these concerns. However, they remain relevant in multi-server installations which use centralized password management systems to push passwords or password hashes to multiple systems. In such installations, the root account on each individual system may be treated as less trusted than the administrators of the centralized password system, so it remains worthwhile to ensure that the security of the password hashing algorithm, including the generation of unique salt values, is adequate.

Another (lesser) benefit of a salt is as follows: two users might choose the same string as their password. Without a salt, this password would be stored as the same hash string in the password file. This would disclose the fact that the two accounts have the same password, allowing anyone who knows one of the account&#x27;s passwords to access the other account. By salting the passwords with two random characters, even if two accounts use the same password, no one can discover this just by reading hashes. Salting also makes it extremely difficult to determine if a person has used the same password for multiple systems.

==Unix implementations==

===1970s–1980s===
Earlier versions of Unix used a password file codice_3 to store the hashes of salted passwords (passwords prefixed with two-character random salts). In these older versions of Unix, the salt was also stored in the passwd file (as cleartext) together with the hash of the salted password. The password file was publicly readable for all users of the system. This was necessary so that user-privileged software tools could find user names and other information. The security of passwords is therefore protected only by the one-way functions (enciphering or hashing) used for the purpose. Early Unix implementations limited passwords to eight characters and used a 12-bit salt, which allowed for 4,096 possible salt values. This was an appropriate balance for 1970s computational and storage costs.

===1980s–present===
The shadow password system is used to limit access to hashes and salt. The salt is eight characters, the hash is 86 characters, and the password length is effectively unlimited, barring stack overflow errors.

==Web-application implementations==
It is common for a web application to store in a database the hash value of a user&#x27;s password. Without a salt, a successful SQL injection attack may yield easily crackable passwords. Because many users re-use passwords for multiple sites, the use of a salt is an important component of overall web application security. Some additional references for using a salt to secure password hashes in specific languages or libraries (PHP, the .NET libraries, etc.) can be found in the external links section below.

<doc id="701760" wikidata="Q1607182" url="?curid=701760" title="James V. Scotti">
<text>James Vernon Scotti (born 1960) is an American astronomer. He was born in Bandon, Oregon, and graduated from Edmonds Woodway High School in Edmonds, Washington in 1978. He received his B.Sc. in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1983. Ever since that time, he has worked on the Spacewatch project, which is one of a number of projects that look for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). He wrote the first automatic asteroid detection software for the project in 1984.

==Discoveries==

Scotti is the discoverer (on February 15, 1997) of 10199 Chariklo, an asteroid with two rings. This is the only known ringed asteroid and the smallest object yet discovered with a ring system.

He has discovered numerous near-Earth asteroids, including (496816) 1989 UP and (uncredited), which briefly created a stir in the news media when a preliminary orbit calculation indicated the possibility of Earth impact in 2028; further observations led to a more accurate orbit, which disproved the impact. In 1991, he discovered 1991 VG, a Near-Earth object with some unusual characteristics. In 2013, he discovered , another NEO that moves in a low eccentricity and low inclination orbit.

He has also recovered more than 75 comets starting in 1985 (since comets are subject to non-gravitational forces due to outgassing and solar wind, it is often a challenge to predict their exact position and rediscover them each time they make a new perihelion approach). He confirmed the discovery of the well known Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which impacted Jupiter in July 1994. He has also discovered the periodic comets 202P/Scotti, 244P/Scotti, 377P/Scotti, P/2010 C1 (Scotti), P/2010 H4 (Scotti), P/2010 H5 (Scotti), P/2011 A2 (Scotti), P/2013 A2 (Scotti), and P/2015 Q1 (Scotti); the later six are not yet numbered as they have only been seen at one perihelion passage. He has also discovered non-periodic comets C/2010 E5 (Scotti) and C/2010 F3 (Scotti).

Scotti&#x27;s research interests include the origin of comets, the dynamical evolution of comets and asteroids, the near-Earth asteroids, and the outer Solar System.

Scotti is also an avid space enthusiast and is interested in the history of space exploration and particularly of the Apollo Program. He has contributed to the &quot;Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&quot;, which details the Apollo lunar explorations. He is also a space artist and photographer.

== Awards and honors==
Asteroid 3594 Scotti, discovered by Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station in 1983, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on September 7, 1987 ().

<text>By Divine Right is a Canadian indie rock band led by guitarist and vocalist José Miguel Contreras.

==History==
The band was formed in 1989 by high school friends Contreras, drummer Mark Goldstein, bass guitarist Liz Teear and guitarist Steve Berman while members were attending Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill, Ontario. The band issued a number of independent releases before signing to Squirtgun Records for their 1997 album &quot;All Hail Discordia&quot;. 

Bassist Brendan Canning and guitarist Leslie Feist joined the band in 1998 in the run up to their 1999 release &quot;Bless This Mess&quot;, which was supported by a Canadian and American national tour opening for The Tragically Hip. Canning and Feist later left the band, and co-founded Broken Social Scene.

In 2001, the band released the album &quot;Good Morning Beautiful&quot;. In 2003, By Divine Right was one of the only Canadian bands to do a concert tour of China.

From 2001 to 2004, the band&#x27;s line up consisted of Contreras, Colleen Hixenbaugh, Brian Borcherdt, John Hall and Dylan Hudecki. In 2004, drummer John Hall was replaced by Cam Giroux (who played on &quot;Good Morning Beautiful&quot;), while Borcherdt and Hudecki both left the band. Hudecki was replaced by Darcy Rego and then Michael Small, both of The Meligrove Band, for tours of the United States, Canada and Britain, supporting &quot;Sweet Confusion&quot;. Filling in on drums for some dates was Loel Campbell of Wintersleep.

After these tours, the band&#x27;s line-up changed again, to Contreras, Hixenbaugh and Small with drummer Derek Downham, followed by a September 2006 show at the Drake Hotel (Toronto) that saw the band perform all new songs with Rego, Small and Jason Nunes (The Meligrove Band) under the By Divine Right name.

By Divine Right&#x27;s next live show was on December 31, 2007, at the Tranzac Club in Toronto, at which the band&#x27;s new full-time line up of Contreras, Stew Heyduk (of The Golden Dogs) and Mitch Perkins (formerly of Rusty) appeared together for the first time.

In 2007, By Divine Right contributed a cover of Rheostatics&#x27; &quot;Shaved Head&quot; to the tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;, with a line-up consisting only of Contreras and Julien Beillard of the band Wooden Stars.

In May 2008, By Divine Right opened a show for The Golden Dogs at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto with yet another new line up, consisting of Contreras, Heyduk and Darcy Rego returning on drums.

In 2009, &quot;Mutant Message&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Confusion&quot;, was released in Canada on the Toronto Arts imprint Hand Drawn Dracula. label The album has José Contreras, Stew Heyduk and Darcy Rego with guest vocals by Jason Nunes and Lily Frost, and features &quot;Que Paso&quot;, the first song Contreras wrote and sung in Spanish despite his longtime fluency in the language. By Divine Right&#x27;s first tours since 2005 followed, with a new drummer, David Joseph, and bass guitarist, Michael Milosh. Music videos were released for the songs &quot;I Love a Girl&quot;, &quot;Cupid in Oilskins&quot; and &quot;I Will Hook You Up&quot;. The band&#x27;s line up changed again after these tours, with Dylan Hudecki and Darcy Rego each filling in before Geordie Dynes and Alysha Haugen joined in late 2010.

In 2013, By Divine Right released its ninth album, &quot;Organized Accidents&quot;. In 2016 they released &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, a track-for-track cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;.

Contreras has also released two solo albums, &quot;José Contreras&quot; (2014) and &quot;At the Slaughterhouse&quot; (2019).

In 2022, By Divine Right released the single &quot;St. Leons&quot; as a preview of the album &quot;OTTO MOTTO&quot;, which was released on September 23, 2022, through Fortune Stellar Records out of Toronto.

<doc id="701762" wikidata="Q1170696" url="?curid=701762" title="1979 Red River Valley tornado outbreak">
<text>On Tuesday, April 10, 1979, a widespread and destructive outbreak of severe weather impacted areas near the Red River between Oklahoma and Texas. Thunderstorms developed over West and North Central Texas during the day within highly unstable atmospheric conditions following the northward surge of warm and moist air into the region, producing large hail, strong winds, and multiple tornadoes. At least 22 tornadoes were documented on April 10, of which two were assigned an F4 rating on the Fujita scale; four of the tornadoes caused fatalities.

Hardest hit were the communities of Vernon, Texas; Lawton, Oklahoma; and Wichita Falls, Texas, which were all impacted by strong tornadoes. The F4 Vernon tornado struck southern and eastern parts of the city at approximately 4:45 p.m. CST, destroying several residential blocks and killing 11 people. An F3 tornado spun up in Lawton at 5:05 p.m. CST, destroying 167 buildings and killing 3 people. The most significant tornado of the day was an F4 tornado that began east-northeast of Holliday, Texas, at around 5:50 p.m. CST and moved east-northeast into Wichita Falls, taking a course through densely-populated areas of the city and destroying over two thousand homes across several neighborhoods. The tornado spanned as wide as across during its passage through the city, with the most severe damage occurring within a wide swath. At least 45 people were killed within the city and nearly 1,800 people were injured, ranking the tornado among the deadliest in Texas history. A majority of the fatalities occurred as the tornado mangled and tossed vehicles. The damage wrought by the Wichita Falls tornado was unprecedented, with the $400 million damage toll making it the costliest tornado on record at the time. The severe weather event was widely observed by scientific instruments due to its serendipitous occurrence during a NASA field campaign. Later studies referred to the tornado outbreak as the Red River Valley Tornado Outbreak, and in the areas affected the day came to be known as Terrible Tuesday.

The same weather system associated with the tornado outbreak produced additional thunderstorms and tornadoes on April 11, particularly in Arkansas. While tornadic activity was more widespread on April 11 compared to April 10 far fewer casualties occurred. The weather system also produced intense rainfall over Mississippi and Alabama that culminated in the 1979 Easter flood, the worst disaster to befall Jackson, Mississippi in over a century.

== Meteorological synopsis ==
=== Preceding the event ===

On April 9, a strong upper-tropospheric trough was located over the western United States. At roughly above the surface, a powerful jet stream extended from the eastern Pacific to South Texas. Although a cold front moving south during the day brought substantially cooler conditions to Oklahoma, it quickly weakened over Texas. Warm and moist air remained over South Texas ahead of the disturbances. Meteorological computer models using data collected at 6 p.m. CST April 9 suggested that severe weather was possible the next day for parts of Oklahoma and Texas but did not as indicate as clearly the possibility of a tornado outbreak. The upper-tropospheric trough moved slower than modeling projected and by 6:00 a.m. CST April 10 had become oriented north-northeast to south-southwest, a characteristically negative tilt associated with many severe weather outbreaks. An occluded front stretched from a quickly intensifying low-pressure area in Colorado into the Texas Panhandle, representing one area conducive to storm development. A wide expanse of stratus clouds covered much of Central Texas during the morning hours as a result of a stable airmass over the area. However, strong southerly winds closer to the surface brought moisture northward from South Texas, concurrent with a rapid increase in atmospheric instability over North Texas. Due to the presence of directional wind shear, the winds over the Red River Valley brought moist air from the south closer to the surface, and drier air from the west further aloft, enhancing convective instability. The leading edge of the northward surge of moisture was marked by an ill-defined warm front. Dew points across the region increased by around to near .

A line of thunderstorms developed over North Texas on the morning of April 10 in response to the surge of warm air, with small hail up to diameter associated with some of the storms. Within the nearby jet stream, an area of locally intense windsa jet streakmoved towards the northeast towards the expanding unstable airmass over north-central Texas. The passage of this core of intense winds aloft induced strong southwesterly winds closer to the surface over eastern New Mexico and West Texas, leading to widespread blowing dust. Wind gusts exceeded across West Texas and reached as high as at Guadalupe Mountains National Park. The dew point at Marfa, Texas, was compared to dew points near over central Texas. This surge of dry air, moving towards the east-northeast at roughly , marked another potential region for storm development. A second area of thunderstorms began to quickly intensify along the leading edge of this dry line and along the occluded front between Amarillo, Texas, and Plainview, Texas. Hail up to in diameter was reported in association with these storms, as well as a tornado east of Plainview at around 1:38 p.m. CST that caused no damage. A third area of thunderstorms, albeit short-lived, developed west of Abilene, Texas, along the western edge of a small region of high pressure. While several of the morning&#x27;s storms moved towards stable conditions and were poised to eventually weaken, particularly conducive conditions for intense thunderstorm development materialized near Lubbock, Texas, at the intersection of the surging dry line, the warm front, and the western edge of the high pressure region.
By the afternoon of April 10, both the warm front and the region of strong winds associated with the jet stream had reached the Red River area, resulting in stronger wind shear. A low-pressure area had also developed in the vicinity of Childress, Texas at around 1–2 p.m. CST, and would serve as a focusing mechanism for converging moisture over the Red River Valley. The National Severe Storms Forecasting Center (NSSFC) issued a tornado watch at 1:55 p.m. CST on April 10 for a area encompassing parts of southwestern Oklahoma and north-central Texas. The watch statement highlighted the potential for tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds within the watch area. Within the risk region, the air pressure fell by in three hours; such drastic pressure falls can precede tornado outbreaks. Strong convergence of moisture was also observed in the areas where storms eventually formed.

=== Tornado outbreak ===
The arrival of the jet streak contributed to the conversion of the atmospheric instability accumulating near the Red River into thunderstorm formation. Just before the onset of the tornado outbreak, a low level jet with winds of materialized over north-central Texas in response to the approach of the jet streak higher aloft, accelerating the transport of heat and moisture northward into the Red River Valley. Thunderstorms developed near Lubbock and moved east-northeastward into a region of high potential instability near the Red River, becoming the strongest thunderstorms of the day. In particular, three isolated supercell thunderstorms caused the majority of the severe weather during the afternoon and evening of April 10; all developed in the localized area of supportive conditions near the frontal intersection. The first thunderstorm formed around 1:00 p.m. CST spawned five tornadoes between 3:05 p.m. CST and 5:15 p.m. CST, including an F4-rated tornado that struck Vernon, Texas, and an F3-rated tornado that struck Lawton, Oklahoma. The second thunderstorm formed around 2:30 p.m. CST, while the third formed around 4:30 p.m. CST. The second supercell produced a tornado that began at 3:55 p.m. and took long trackthe longest track of any tornado during the eventthrough primarily rural areas near Harrold, Texas and Grandfield, Oklahoma. The most damaging tornado, associated with the third supercell, began at around 5:55 p.m. CST and struck Wichita Falls, Texas. These storms persisted into nighttime over central and eastern Oklahoma. The breakout of severe weather and tornadoes associated with the thunderstorms near the Red River during the afternoon and evening of April 10 was collectively termed the &quot;Red River Valley outbreak&quot; or the &quot;Red River Valley tornado outbreak&quot; by scientists studying the event. At least 12 tornadoes occurred within of Wichita Falls in a single two-hour period. The last tornado that occurred in the Red River Valley occurred around 8:00 p.m. CST in connection with the third supercell near Pruitt City, Oklahoma. The thunderstorms that produced the tornadoes in the Red River Valley continued into Arkansas and southern Missouri during the overnight hours but did not produce severe weather.
The arrival of a second and weaker region of strong winds within the nearby jet stream led to the development of severe thunderstorms, including some tornadoes, farther south over west-central and northern Texas during the overnight hours. These tornadoes caused extensive damage in rural areas and some injuries. Like the severe event earlier in the day along the Red River, the development of these storms was aided by a localized area of low pressure that developed near Abilene at around 7:20 p.m. CST. Additional storms also persisted over the Midwestern United States into the morning of April 11. The broader weather system that produced the severe weather on April 10 continued eastward towards the Mississippi River Valley the next day and intensified. April 11 ultimately proved to be a more active day for severe weather, with Arkansas experiencing most of the day&#x27;s tornadoes; however, fewer casualties resulted from the tornadoes compared to the previous day. The 27 tornadoes that were ultimately documented by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Arkansas during April 1979 set a new monthly record high for the state. Heavy rains over Mississippi and Alabama associated with the same weather system on April 11–13 led to extensive flooding along the banks of the Pearl River and Tombigbee River. Rainfall totals reached , with the flood near Jackson, Mississippi, being representative of a 1 in 500-year or 1 in 100-year flood event.

== Confirmed tornadoes ==
NWS offices in Texas and Oklahoma reported 56 fatalities from the tornadoes on April 10, with 53 in Texas and 3 in Oklahoma across a combined 12 counties. Another 1,916 people were injured, of which 256 were hospitalized. The American Red Cross reported 2,934 homes destroyed with another 3,263 damaged. April 10 featured the most damaging tornado outbreak since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Four tornadoes caused fatalities that day. The NWS characterized the tornado outbreak as &quot;one of the most significant tornado outbreaks that ever occurred in western north Texas and southern Oklahoma.&quot; The atmospheric environment surrounding the April 10 severe weather outbreak and the thunderstorms that eventually formed were closely observed as part of the Severe Environmental Storms and Mesoscale Experiment (SESAME), a scientific field campaign aimed at studying severe weather. As part of SESAME, an extensive survey of affected areas was undertaken following the event, including interviews of civil defense directors and ground and aerial surveys of tornado paths. Damage along the paths of 12 of the tornadoes on April 10 were rated with the Fujita scale by Ted Fujita and Roger Wakimoto based on observations from a low-flying Cessna aircraft on April 12–13, with a presumed ±1 margin of error.

=== Thalia–Vernon, Texas/Davidson, Oklahoma ===

The first of three intense and tornadic thunderstorms produced a tornado in southern Foard County, Texas, at 2:05 p.m. CST. While this first tornado was still on the ground, the same thunderstorm produced a second tornado in Foard County so north of Thalia, at around 3:20 p.m. CST; the two tornadoes were separated by and moved in parallel for . The second tornado continued into Wilbarger County, after the first dissipated. It tracked towards the Lockett, area along US 70, damaging farms and homes. Fujita and Wakimoto assessed up to F2-rated tornado damage between Thalia and Lockett. The tornado crossed the highway north of Lockett. One person was killed by the tornado after their vehicle was blown off US-70 into a pasture.

The tornado then moved northeast towards the Vernon, area. Its large size made identification of its tornadic nature by storm spotters difficult. Tornado sirens were activated shortly before the tornado struck Vernon. The tornado entered Vernon at around 3:45 p.m. CST and moved over southern and eastern parts of the city. Several residential blocks in southern Vernon were destroyed by the tornado, leading to at least three deaths. The damage was especially severe along Gordon and Atlanta streets. In eastern Vernon, the tornado razed several buildings, including the Wilbarger Exhibit Building and a Texas Highway Department warehouse. The tornado then crossed US 287, blowing vehicles off the highway and killing seven people. A total of ten fatalities occurred in Vernon. Fujita and Wakimoto assessed up to low-end F4-rated tornado damage in the Vernon area. The tornado crossed the Pease River outside of Vernon, killing cows along the riverbank, and crossed into Oklahoma near the confluence of the Pease River and Red River with approximately F1 intensity. The tornado passed east-northeast of Davidson, destroying at least three homes and inflicting major damage on another five. One person was injured in Oklahoma after their car was blown by the tornado. Numerous cattle were also killed or injured by the tornado. Fujita and Wakimoto assessed up to F2-rated tornado damage in the Davidson area. The tornado lifted at around 4:00 p.m. CST.

The tornado&#x27;s path spanned , with about in Texas and in Oklahoma. The tornado&#x27;s width averaged about . The Institute for Disaster Research conducted aerial surveys of the tornado, rating it an F4 on the Fujita scale based on the resulting damage. The institute estimated that the tornado&#x27;s maximum winds were based on the degree to which residences were damaged, the damage to the Texas Highway Department, the destruction of a motel and restaurant along US-287, and the distance over which impacted vehicles were blown by the tornado. The same thunderstorm that produced the Vernon tornado later produced another three tornadoes in Oklahoma.

=== Holliday–Wichita Falls, Texas/Waurika, Oklahoma ===
Parts of Wichita Falls, were struck by a violent tornado on the evening of April 10. The tornado was up to wide as it tore through the city, with the swath of particularly intense damage spanning wide. The tornado swept east-northeastward through a stretch of residential areas covering , directly causing 42 fatalities according to the National Weather Service (NWS); another three people later died of heart attacks. A survey by the Center for Disease Control enumerated 44 fatalities and 171 injuries requiring hospitalization, while a later study published in &quot;Science&quot; in February 1980 enumerated 45 deaths from traumatic injuries inflicted by the tornado, 1 from sepsis, and 1 from tetanus. Of the fatalities, 25 were vehicle-related deaths; 11 people died while attempting to evade the tornado in their vehicles after fleeing their otherwise undamaged homes. Only five deaths occurred indoors. Around 1,700 people sustained injuries in Wichita Falls, including 59 with serious injuries. Numerous residences were destroyed in the city, including 2,095 homes, 1,062 apartment units and 93 mobile homes. Over 3,000 homes left uninhabitable by the tornado. The widespread devastation left approximately 20,000 people from 5,000 families homeless, accounting for about 10–20% of the city&#x27;s population. Vehicles were thrown as far as away by the tornado. The destruction amounted to $400 million in damage, making the tornado the costliest tornado on record at the time. When normalized for wealth and inflation, the tornado caused approximately $1.14 billion in damage in 1997 United States dollars. Advance notice of the approaching tornado and the awareness of prior tornadoes earlier in the day in nearby Rocky Point and Vernon may have contributed to lowering the ultimate death toll.

The thunderstorm that eventually produced the Wichita Falls tornado formed north of Abilene and generally moved towards the northeast. Weather radar observed reflectivity values exceeded 50 dBZ throughout the storm&#x27;s lifetime, with the radar signal routinely exceeding above the surface; satellite observations suggested cloud top heights reaching as high as . The thunderstorm produced an F2 tornado earlier in the day in Baylor County, and hail up to in diameter in Archer, Baylor, Wichita, and Wilbarger counties. Another thunderstorm produced a tornado in Wichita County about west-southwest of Iowa Park. The Wichita Falls weather service office issued a tornado warning for Wichita County at 5:08 p.m. in response to sightings of this tornado, and tornado sirens were sounded in Wichita Falls at 5:25 p.m. The first thunderstorm eventually approached Wichita County, prompting a severe thunderstorm warning for the county at 5:45 p.m. CST. Two mesoscyclones within the thunderstorm were apparent on radar, including one associated with the earlier tornado in Baylor County.
At around 5:50 p.m. CST, a tornado developed in connection with the second mesocyclone on the southwestern flanks of the thunderstorm east-northeast of Holliday, Texas, in Archer County. Witnesses observed smaller vortices embedded in the broader tornadic circulation as it developed, highlighting the multiple-vortex nature of the tornado; the individual vorticies coalesced as the tornado approached Wichita Falls. Evidence of a tornado first became apparent on weather radar at 5:58 p.m. CST, while the tornado was about southwest of the center of Wichita Falls. The initial reports of the tornado by amateur storm spotters provided residents of Wichita Falls with about 5–10 minutes of notice before the tornado&#x27;s eventual arrival. The Wichita Falls weather service office issued a tornado warning for Wichita County at 6:00 p.m. CST, just as the first tornado warning expired, warning of the approach of this new tornado. The tornado moved along the Fort Worth and Denver Railway into Wichita County, blowing away two oil storage tanks and unroofing several homes near FM 2560; the swept oil tanks produced an oil spill. Six high-tension steel electrical transmission towers east of the road were damaged, with three blown prostrate. The tornado darkened and widened to a width of roughly across as it moved into Wichita Falls at around 6:15 p.m. CST, impacting Memorial Stadium. The stadium field house was heavily damaged and stadium lighting was snapped. As the tornado passed just south of the stadium, it rapidly strengthened to high-end F4 intensity and maintained this strength for the next of its path. The tornado then caused the collapse of the western half of McNiel Junior High School; the school was largely unoccupied when the tornado struck. After striking the stadium, the tornado began to move through heavily populated residential areas. The Western Hills neighborhood south of Southwest Parkway was struck next, resulting in the first fatalities caused by the tornado. Numerous homes and several apartment complexes were destroyed in the neighborhood.

The tornado widened to a width of about as it crossed Southwest Parkway into the Faith Village neighborhood, levelling several businesses and tossing vehicles about. The Southwest National Bank Building was levelled with the exception of its vault. The tornado destroyed most homes in Faith Village. Small interior rooms in most of the destroyed homes remained intact, resulting in relatively few fatalities despite the severity of destruction. The cafeteria auditorium and exterior classrooms at Ben Milam Elementary School sustained heavy damage. The tornado proceeded to raze businesses along Kemp Boulevard, including a restaurant where three people were killed. The northern periphery of the tornado struck the Sikes Senter shopping mall, causing the partial collapse of a JCPenney store and inflicting light to moderate damage to other stores in the mall. Several of the roughly 1,000 shoppers in the mall suffered major injuries. The tornadic winds heaped cars in the shopping mall&#x27;s parking lot atop one another or blew them away. Several people were killed or injured in the parking lot, including some who had fled from the mall to their cars. A church south of the mall was flattened, resulting in one fatality. The tornado entered the Colonial Park neighborhood after traversing a greenbelt and clipping the southern side of Midwestern State University, destroying many homes and apartment complexes in Colonial Park. The second stories of apartment buildings saw particularly severe damage. Additional homes and a shopping center were razed in the Southmoor subdivision. The tornado then crossed US 281 and moved into the Sun Valley neighborhood along the southern side of US 287, destroying apartments, houses, and businesses. Cars were wrecked on US 287, resulting in a few fatalities. Among the fatalities were some who sought shelter underneath a highway overpass. The Sunnyside Heights mobile home park north of the highway was destroyed, though no fatalities resulted as residents had evacuated.
Industrial plants were subsequently destroyed, including a Levi Strauss &amp; Co. manufacturing plant, as the tornado moved into Clay County south of SH 79. The Wichita Falls weather service office issued a tornado warning for Clay County at 6:11 p.m. CST shortly before the office lost power. Homes were destroyed by the tornado south of TX-79 along a path from Wichita Falls to Dean, and Petrolia, contributing to the $15 million damage toll wrought by the twister in Clay County. Forty people were injured in the county. Fujita and Wakimoto assessed up to F4-rated tornado damage between Wichita Falls and Dean, with F0-rated damage south of Petrolia. The tornado uprooted 200 trees along the Red River as it crossed into Oklahoma around east of Byers at 6:30 p.m. CST. The tornado&#x27;s path gradually curved towards the left after entering Oklahoma, bringing it to areas southwest of Waurika. The most severe damage inflicted by the tornado in the state occurred alone Noble Wray Road, where 20 homes were destroyed or damaged. The frame of one mobile home was greatly contorted and blown away. Fujita and Wakimoto assessed up to F2-level damage southwest of Waurika. The tornado dissipated just before 7:00 p.m. CST north-northeast of Waurika. Widespread F0-intensity damage continued for past Waurika, though this damage was likely caused by a large downburst rather than a continuation of the tornado.

In total, the tornado was on the ground for approximately 70 minutes, with of path long, including in Texas and in Oklahoma. Based on aerial surveys of the damage, the Institute for Disaster Research assessed the tornado as reaching F4 intensity and estimated that the tornado&#x27;s maximum wind speeds reached . The most extreme damage wrought by the tornado occurred at McNiel Junior High School and Southwest National Bank. Later engineering analysis of the higher-end damage suggested winds consistent with that of a strong F4 tornado, though there was ample preceding scientific discussion concerning whether or not the extreme damage could be graded as F5-intensity damage. Unlike most tornadoes, the corridor of strongest winds associated with the Wichita Falls tornado was unusually wide; the swath of F4-severity damage was nearly across in vicinity of Ben Milam Elementary School and the Faith Village neighborhood. The thunderstorm that produced the Wichita Falls tornado also dropped hail up to diameter in Wichita Falls north of the tornado path. Survivors of the tornado also observed hail the size of golf balls immediately preceding and following passage of the tornado. The broader winds associated with the mesocyclone that spawned the Wichita Falls tornado caused light damage throughout much of the city.
== Aftermath ==
Within Wichita Falls $63 million in losses were eligible for federal disaster aid. The apparent survivability of small interior rooms despite the widespread destruction of homes and businesses encouraged the development of reinforced safe rooms. The viability of safe rooms and the high number of fatalities among those who fled their homes led to increased emphasis on seeking indoor shelter in tornado preparedness, as opposed to the older idea of opening windows to reduce tornado damage.

April 10, 1979, came to be known as &quot;Terrible Tuesday&quot; in the areas affected by the tornadoes along the Oklahoma–Texas border. In 1984, the NWS produced a documentary covering the Wichita Falls tornado, titled &quot;Terrible Tuesday&quot;, in collaboration with the American Red Cross and FEMA. One Wichita Falls park features a plaque with the names of the 45 people who died during and after the Wichita Falls tornado, with a tree dedicated to each of the victims. Another park near the downtown area bears crape myrtle sculptures symbolizing the city&#x27;s recovery.

<text>The Bucks County Playhouse is located in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

When the &quot;Hope Mills&quot; burned in 1790, Benjamin Parry rebuilt the grist mills as the &quot;New Hope Mills.&quot; The town was renamed for the mills.
The building was saved from demolition in the 1930s. It was purchased and run by a group of people including playwrights Moss Hart and Kenyon Nicholson. Renovations converting the building into a theater began in 1938. The first production at the new Bucks County Playhouse was &quot;Springtime for Henry&quot; featuring Edward Everett Horton. It opened on July 1, 1939.

The Bucks County Playhouse became a summer theater. It was the starting point for many actors and became a place where plays slated for Broadway were tried out. Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot in the Park,&quot; starring Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley, had its premiere at the theater in 1963.

The Bucks County Playhouse Conservancy, a public/private partnership, raised sufficient funds to regain the property following a 2010 foreclosure. Following an extensive renovation, the theater reopened on July 2, 2012.

<doc id="701773" wikidata="Q4009" url="?curid=701773" title="Ramesses IX">
<text>Neferkare Setepenre Ramesses IX (also written Ramses) (originally named Amon-her-khepshef Khaemwaset) (ruled 1129–1111 BC) was the eighth pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt. He was the third longest serving king of this Dynasty after Ramesses III and Ramesses XI. He is now believed to have assumed the throne on I Akhet day 21 based on evidence presented by Jürgen von Beckerath in a 1984 GM article. According to the latest archaeological information, Ramesses IX died in Regnal Year 19 I Peret day 27 of his reign. Therefore, he enjoyed a reign of 18 years, 4 months and 6 days. His throne name, Neferkare Setepenre, means &quot;Beautiful Is The Soul of Re, Chosen of Re.&quot; Ramesses IX is believed to be the son of Mentuherkhepeshef, a son of Ramesses III, since Mentuherkhopshef&#x27;s wife, the lady Takhat bears the prominent title of King&#x27;s Mother on the walls of tomb KV10, which she usurped and reused in the late 20th Dynasty; no other 20th Dynasty king is known to have had a mother with this name. Ramesses IX was, therefore, probably a grandson of Ramesses III.

==Tomb robberies==

His reign is best known for the year 16 and year 17 tomb robbery trials, recorded in the Abbott Papyrus, the Papyrus Leopold II, Papyrus BM 10054 and on the recto of both Papyrus BM 10053 and Papyrus BM 10068. It has been suggested that the undated Papyrus Mayer B, dealing with the plundering of the tomb of Ramesses VI, may also stem from his reign.

During these trials it became clear that several royal and noble tombs in the Western Theban Necropolis had been robbed, including that of a 17th Dynasty king, Sobekemsaf II. Paser, Mayor of Eastern Thebes or Karnak, accused his subordinate Paweraa, the Mayor of West Thebes responsible for the safety of the necropolis, of being either culpable in this wave of robberies or negligent in his duties of protecting the Valley of the Kings from incursions by tomb robbers. Paweraa played a leading part in the vizierial commission set up to investigate, and, not surprisingly, it proved impossible for Paweraa to be officially charged with any crime due to the circumstantiality of the evidence. Paser disappeared from sight soon after the report was filed.

==Projects==

In the sixth year of his reign, he inscribed his titulature in the Lower Nubian town of Amara West. Most of his building works centre on the sun temple centre of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt where the most significant monumental works of his reign are located. However, he also decorated the wall to the north of the Seventh Pylon in the Temple of Amun-Re at Karnak. Finally, his name has been found at the Dakhla Oasis in Western Egypt and Gezer at Canaan which may suggest a residual Egyptian influence in Asia; the majority of the New Kingdom Empire&#x27;s possessions in Canaan and Syria had long been lost to the Sea Peoples by his reign. He is also known for having honoured his predecessors Ramesses II, Ramesses III and Ramesses VII. He also paid close attention to Lower Egypt and built a substantial monument at Heliopolis.

==Family==
Ramesses IX is known to have had two sons: at Heliopolis, &quot;a gateway was reinscribed with texts including the king&#x27;s names and also those of the prince and High Priest Nebmaatre, who was fairly certainly his son.&quot; Ramesses IX&#x27;s second son, Montuherkhopshef C, perhaps this king&#x27;s intended heir, who did not live long enough to succeed his father, took over the former KV19 tomb of Sethirkhepsef B in the Valley of the Kings. The throne was instead assumed by Ramesses X whose precise relationship to Ramesses IX is unclear. Ramesses X might have been Ramesses IX&#x27;s son, but this assumption remains unproven. Tomb KV19, which was one of the most beautifully decorated tombs in the royal valley, had been abandoned by Sethirkhepsef B when the latter assumed the throne as king Ramesses VIII and one of prince Montuherkhopshef&#x27;s depictions there &quot;bears the prenomen cartouche to Ramesses IX on its belt&quot; thereby establishing the identity of this prince&#x27;s father. The tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, has been open since antiquity, as is evidenced by the presence of Roman and Greek graffiti on the tomb walls. It is quite long in the tradition of the &#x27;syringe&#x27; tunnels of the later 19th and 20th Dynasties and lies directly opposite the tomb of Ramesses II in the Valley of the Kings; this fact may have influenced Ramesses IX&#x27;s choice of location for his final resting place due to its proximity to this great Pharaoh. While Ramesses IX&#x27;s chief queen is not precisely identified in surviving Egyptian inscriptions, she was most likely Baketwernel.

==Burial and rediscovery==
In 1881, the mummy of Ramesses IX (nr. 5209) was found in the Deir el-Bahri cache (DB320) within one of the two coffins of Neskhons—wife of the Theban High Priest Pinedjem II. This pharaoh&#x27;s mummy was not apparently examined by Grafton Elliot Smith and not included in his 1912 catalogue of the Royal Mummies. When the mummy was unwrapped by Maspero, a bandage was found from a year 5, mentioning the lady Neskhons, most probably from the reign of king Siamun. A further strip of linen from a year 7 identified the mummy as &quot;Ra Khaemwaset&quot; which can be taken as a reference to either Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun (IX) or Ramesses Khaemwaset Meryamun Neterheqainu (XI). But since an ivory box of Neferkare Ramesses IX was found in the royal cache itself, and Ramesses XI was probably never buried at Thebes but rather in Lower Egypt, &quot;the [royal] mummy is most likely to be that of Ramesses IX himself.&quot; 
It is estimated that the king was about 50 years old when he died (but it is extremely difficult to correctly establish the age of mummies) and his mummy was found to have broken limbs, a broken neck and damage to its nose, which is missing.

In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade. 

==In modern literature==
The novel &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot; by Norman Mailer is told from the perspective of characters living during the reign of Ramesses IX, including Ramesses IX himself. Most but not all of the novel takes place on one long evening in 1123 or 1122 BCE, during which the characters (including Ramesses IX) tell stories of the past. The majority of the book concerns the reign of Ramesses II, approximately 150 years before the night of the narrative; the Battle of Kadesh (1274 BCE) is in turn the central event of this sub-narrative.

<doc id="701775" wikidata="Q1266693" url="?curid=701775" title="Fluke (film)">
<text>Fluke is a 1995 American fantasy drama film directed by Carlo Carlei from a screenplay by Carlei and James Carrington, based on the 1977 novel of the same name by James Herbert. It stars Matthew Modine as a self-centered businessman who is reincarnated as a dog and attempts to reconnect with his family. Nancy Travis, Eric Stoltz, Jon Polito, Max Pomeranc, and Samuel L. Jackson appear in supporting roles.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on June 2, 1995, by MGM/UA Distribution Co. It received negative to mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, grossing only $3.9 million. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, it earned two nominations: Best Fantasy Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Pomeranc.

== Plot ==
A mutt puppy who has flashing memories and dreams of having lived a human life is taken to a pound and eventually escapes. He is raised by an elderly homeless woman named Bella, who gives him the name Fluke, stating that he is a &quot;fluke by nature, Fluke by name.&quot; Fluke supports Bella by helping her earn money from passing strangers, who are impressed with Fluke&#x27;s ability to beat Bella&#x27;s shell game.

After Bella dies of an illness, Fluke meets a street-wise dog named Rumbo who takes him to see a man named Bert who feeds them. Fluke matures into an adult dog and eventually realizes that he was once a man named Thomas P. Johnson, who died in a car crash.

Fluke is abducted by a man named Sylvester to be used in makeup experiments at a cosmetics company. During his captivity, Rumbo comes to the rescue, but is shot by Sylvester as he and Fluke escape. A dying Rumbo tells Fluke that the black-and-white snapshot of a man in a sailor suit on Bert&#x27;s wall was him and Bert was his brother and that he wishes to smell the sea again, suggesting that he died in the line of duty.

After Rumbo&#x27;s death, Fluke seeks out his surviving wife Carol and son Brian and reunites with them by becoming their new family dog. Though Carol is apprehensive about adopting Fluke, she caves in, seeing how Brian has quickly bonded with Fluke. During his life as a dog, Fluke gets to know his family better and realizes that he had been a distant workaholic.

As more memories return, Fluke suspects that his human death was caused by his former business partner, Jeff Newman. Enraged by this and that Jeff is now dating Carol, Fluke viciously attacks him when he visits the house, and ends up getting put outside. Jeff calls for Animal Control against the protests of Brian, and Fluke is forced to run from the premises.

The next night, Brian goes missing while looking for Fluke and Carol implores Jeff to help, so Jeff drives back to their house. Fluke, hiding in the backseat of Jeff&#x27;s car, comes close to killing Jeff by causing him to get into a car accident like his own. Fluke then has another flashback and realizes that Jeff wasn&#x27;t responsible for his death. Instead, Fluke had caused his own death when he recklessly drove on the wrong side of the road just to argue with Jeff one night and swerved off to avoid hitting an oncoming truck. Jeff then tried to save him, but failed. An injured Jeff, implied to have realized Fluke&#x27;s true identity but bearing no ill will, tells Fluke to go find Brian before the latter catches hypothermia from the falling snow. Regretful over his actions, Fluke barks for a passing driver to help Jeff before running off.

On a hunch, Fluke goes to the graveyard where he had been buried and finds Brian there, who had been locked in by an unaware groundskeeper. Fluke huddles with Brian to keep him warm. Carol, deducing from one of Brian&#x27;s drawings where he may have gone, uses her car to break open the cemetery gates and picks up Brian. Carol tries to coax Fluke to come home with them. Instead, Fluke digs away at the snow in front of his tombstone to show Carol who he really is by uncovering the word &quot;forever&quot; at the bottom, a phrase he often said to her as a human. Carol is left speechless, and lets Fluke leave without objection. With a heavy heart, Fluke departs and entrusts his family to Jeff for their happiness. He monologues that he finally accepted that he can no longer be the family man he should have been, and that he should just cherish the life he has now.

Sometime later, Fluke is resting under a tree on a farm by himself. To his surprise and happiness, he is reunited with Rumbo, now reincarnated as a squirrel. Rumbo tells Fluke about life as a squirrel and about reincarnation.

==Production==
Italian filmmaker Carlo Carlei wrote the adaptation of James Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Fluke&quot; with co-writer James Carrington with the intention of getting the film greenlit at a major Hollywood studio. Carlei had come close to getting the film greenlit at Paramount Pictures for producer Fred Roos, but the departure of Sid Ganis as the studio&#x27;s Head of Production derailed development. Then Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer co-chairman and chief executive officer Alan Ladd Jr. upon screening Carlei&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Innocent&quot; was impressed enough where Ladd acquired &quot;Flight of the Innocent&quot; for U.S. distribution and signed Carlei to a one-picture deal with &quot;Fluke&quot; being greenlit. The film was shot in Atlanta, Georgia for twelve weeks in 1994.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Fluke&quot; was released on VHS on November 21, 1995 and LaserDisc on November 28, 1995 by MGM/UA Home Video in North America (which was presented in the theatrical version and available exclusively through Warner Home Video). &quot;Fluke&quot; was also released on VHS on November 5, 1996 by MGM/UA Family Entertainment in North America (which has been edited for family viewing and was also available exclusively through Warner Home Video). In Japan, &quot;Fluke&quot; was released on VHS on July 5, 1996 by Warner Home Video under the MGM/UA Family Entertainment label (which was presented in the theatrical version).

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $3,987,768 in North America.

===Critical response===
Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Fluke&quot; as &quot;the kind of pompous movie in which Fluke learns some life lessons and Mr. Modine says in a high-serious voice-over&quot; and stated, &quot;Though it is meant to be whimsical and touching, the film&#x27;s style is leaden, and its story has more danger than excitement. […] &quot;Fluke&quot; is too serious for children and too ridiculous for adults.&quot;

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;one of the weirdest, most depressing family films ever made&quot; and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s a bizarre hybrid of wet-nosed tear-jerker and adult psychodrama, with a bummer conclusion, and out-there Buddhist-lite themes about life beyond the grave, guaranteed to send kids sobbing into the night.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined, &quot;Maybe if &quot;Fluke&quot;, which might have been better as an animated feature, weren&#x27;t such a lavish, big-deal production and closer to the modest level of the recent — and pleasant little — pig movie &quot;Gordy&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t seem so overwhelmingly, at times even laughably, foolish. The film&#x27;s human actors acquit themselves admirably under the circumstances, but there&#x27;s no question that the stars are Comet (as Fluke) and Barney (as Rumpo), bolstered by excellent trainers and special-effects personnel.&quot;

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;The adventure doesn&#x27;t pander to kids, though toward the end it gets overly emotional, milking every situation with lengthy reaction shots and cute closeups of Fluke&quot; and &quot;all three adults — Modine, Travis and Stoltz — otherwise accomplished and attractive performers, assume secondary status to the gorgeous dog and his loyal benefactor, Pomeranc.&quot;

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade of &quot;D&quot; and commented, &quot;With the exception of the cheek-pinchable Pomeranc, the cast gives performances as bewildered as the plot is bewildering. There is, though, one other star: The dog is great.&quot;

<text>Online casinos, also known as virtual casinos or Internet casinos, are online versions of traditional (&quot;brick and mortar&quot;) casinos. Online casinos enable gamblers to play and wager on casino games through the Internet. It is a prolific form of online gambling.

Some online casinos claim higher payback percentages for slot machine games, and some publish payout percentage audits on their websites. Assuming that the online casino is using an appropriately programmed random number generator, table games like blackjack have an established house edge. The payout percentage for these games are established by the rules of the game.

== Types ==
Online casinos are broadly divided into two categories based on the software they use: web-based and download-only casinos. Traditionally, online casinos would include only one of the two platforms. However, with advanced technological changes, an online casino can now accommodate both.

=== Web-based ===
Web-based online casinos (also known as no-download casinos) are websites where users may play casino games without downloading software to their local computer. A stable internet connection is required to have a seamless gaming experience as all graphics, sounds, and animations are loaded through the web. Most online casinos allow gameplay through an HTML interface, previously this was done through browser plugins, such as Flash Player, Shockwave Player, or Java.

=== Download-based ===
Download-based online casinos require the download of the software client in order to play and wager on the casino games offered. The online casino software connects to the casino service provider and handles contact without browser support. Download-based online casinos generally run faster than web-based online casinos since the graphics and sound programs are cached by the software client, rather than having to be loaded from the Internet. On the other hand, the initial download and installation of the casino&#x27;s software take time. As with any download from the Internet, the risk of the program containing malware exists, which makes it less popular among skeptical casino players.

=== App-based ===
App-based casinos are digital platforms that allow users to engage in gambling activities via applications on smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. Unlike traditional online casinos that require players to access games through a web browser, app-based casinos offer a more integrated and user-friendly experience through dedicated applications. These casinos provide a wide array of gambling options, including slot machines, table games, and live dealer games, all optimized for mobile play. The rise of app-based casinos reflects the increasing reliance on mobile technology and the demand for accessible, on-the-go entertainment options. They operate under various jurisdictions, requiring adherence to strict regulatory standards to ensure fairness, security, and responsible gambling. App-based casinos have revolutionized the gambling industry by combining the convenience of mobile technology with the excitement of casino gaming, making it easier for users to enjoy their favorite gambling activities anytime and anywhere.

== Games ==

===Virtual===
Also known as software-based online casino games, the outcome of these games is determined using a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) software. This software ensures that every deal of the card, the outcome of a dice throw, or the results produced by the spinning of a slot machine or roulette wheel is totally random and unpredictable. PRNGs use a set of mathematical instructions known as an algorithm to generate a long stream of numbers that give the impression of true randomness. While this is not the same as true random number generation (computers are incapable of this without an external input source), it provides results that satisfy all but the most stringent requirements for true randomness.

When implemented correctly, a PRNG algorithm such as the Mersenne Twister will ensure that the games are both fair and unpredictable. However, usually, the player has to trust that the software has not been rigged to increase the house edge, as its inner workings are invisible to the user. Properly regulated online casinos are audited externally by independent regulators to ensure that their win percentages are in line with the stated odds, and this can provide a degree of assurance to the player that the games are fair, assuming the player trusts the regulator.

===Live dealer===
Live dealer casino games are the complete opposite of software-based games. Instead of depending on software to determine the outcome of the roulette spin, dice throw, or deal of a card, these games depend on real-time results. This is possible as the games are streamed in real-time from a land-based casino or a studio recreated to mimic a land-based casino.

To ensure that players have an easy time playing these games and that the land-based environment is fully recreated, software developers include innovative features such as the chat feature. This enables the player to type a message to the dealer and they can respond back verbally. The live chat feature can also be used to communicate with other players seated at the table following a set of rules laid down by the casino.

The results of the physical transactions by the dealer, such as the outcome of the roulette wheel spin or the dealing of cards, are translated into data that can be utilized by the software by means of optical character recognition (OCR) technology. This enables the player to interact with the game in much the same way as they would with a virtual casino game, except for the fact that the results are determined by real-life actions rather than automated processes.

These games are a lot more expensive for websites to host than virtual games, as they involve a heavier investment in technology and staffing. A live casino studio typically employs one or more cameramen, several croupiers running the various games, an information technology manager to ensure that any technical hitches are dealt with swiftly, and a pit boss that acts as an adjudicator in case of disputes between players and croupiers.

In most cases, this requires at least a three-room setup, comprising a live studio, a server/software room, and an analyst’s room. The configuration of these rooms varies from casino to casino, with some having several gaming tables in one room, and some having a single table in each room.

The high running costs involved with operating live dealer games is the reason why online casinos only tend to offer a handful of the most popular games in this format, such as roulette, blackjack, sic bo, and baccarat. In comparison, the running costs associated with virtual games are very low, and it is not uncommon for online casinos to offer hundreds of different virtual casino games to players on their site.

Online casinos vary in their approach to the hosting of live games, with some providing live games via their own television channel, and others offering the games exclusively via their website. In the case of televised games, players can often use their mobile phone or television remote controls to place bets instead of doing so via a computer connected to the internet. The most common live dealer games offered at online casinos are baccarat, blackjack, and roulette.

===Examples===
A typical selection of gambling games offered at an online casino might include:

*Baccarat
*Blackjack
*Craps
*Roulette
*Sic bo
*Slot machines
*Poker
*Keno
*Bingo

==Bonuses==
Many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses to new players making their first deposit, and often on subsequent play as well. These bonuses are a form of marketing that may incur a cost (potentially justifiable in order to attract a new player who may return and deposit many more times), since the casino is essentially giving away money in return for a commitment from the player to wager a certain minimum amount before they are allowed to withdraw. Since all casino games have a house edge, the wagering requirements ensure that the player cannot simply walk away with the casino&#x27;s money immediately after claiming the bonus. These wagering requirements are commonly set to be sufficiently high that the player has a negative expectation, exactly as if they had deposited and not claimed a bonus.

Casinos may choose to restrict certain games from fulfilling the wagering requirements, either to restrict players from playing low-edge games or to restrict &#x27;risk-free&#x27; play (betting for instance both red and black on roulette), thereby completing the wagering requirement with a guaranteed profit after the bonus is taken into account.

===Welcome===
The Welcome bonus is a deposit match bonus on the first deposit ever made in the casino or casino group. Welcome bonuses sometimes come in packages and may be given to match the first two or three deposits (First Deposit Welcome Bonus, Second Deposit Welcome Bonus, etc.). They can also be tied to specific games, such as the Welcome Slots Bonus or the Welcome Table Games Bonus. The casino may also offer Welcome bonuses for high rollers who make an initial deposit above the standard amount limit.

===Referral===
There are two types of Referral bonuses: one for the Referee and one for the Referrer. The Referee gets a bonus when he or she registers an account at the casino and mentions the Referrer. The Referrer gets a bonus when the Referee completes all the requirements, such as making the deposit and wagering it a certain number of times.

===Cashback or insurance===
Cashback or Insurance bonuses are offered as a percentage of all losses in the player’s previous gaming activity. Typically, only deposits that were not matched with bonuses count towards this bonus. There are also websites that offer casino cashback payments based on losses encountered while playing with one or more online casinos. Those types of cashback deals are usually paid back to players by the casino portal that offers those special cashback offers.

===No-deposit===
The most popular form of bonus is one that can be claimed without the need to deposit any of the player&#x27;s own money - known as a no deposit bonus. These bonuses are used as acquisition tools by casinos wishing to attract new players. No deposit bonuses don&#x27;t always take the form of real cash, as exemplified below.

===Non-cashable===
Non-cashable bonuses may be called &quot;sticky&quot; or &quot;phantom&quot; bonuses. In both cases, the bonus forms a part of the player&#x27;s balance, but cannot be cashed out. The difference between cash-able and phantom bonuses comes at cashout time. A phantom bonus is deducted from the player&#x27;s balance at the moment he places his withdrawal request. For example: if a player deposited $100, received $100, played, and finished the wagering at $150. If the bonus is sticky, the player will be able to withdraw just $50. If the bonus is cash-able, then the whole balance is available for withdrawal.

=== Comp points ===

Comps are commonly available at land-based casinos, but also exist online. Comp points can usually be exchanged for cash, prizes, or other comps. The amount of cash given per wager is usually very small and often varies with game selection. A casino might offer three comp points for each $10 wagered on slots and one comp point for each $10 wagered on blackjack. The casino might give $1 for each 100 comp points. This example is equivalent to returning 0.3% of wagers on slots and 0.1% of wagers on blackjack. In addition, online casinos may offer comps such as free tickets to online tournaments, free slots online, tickets to other special events, extra bonuses, souvenirs, and payback.

===Hunting===
Bonus hunting (also known as bonus bagging or bonus whoring) is a type of advantage gambling where turning a profit from casino, sportsbook and poker room bonus situations is mathematically possible. For example, the house edge in blackjack is roughly 0.5%. If a player is offered a $100 cashable bonus requiring $5000 in wagering on blackjack with a house edge of 0.5%, the expected loss is $25. Therefore, the player has an expected gain of $75 after claiming the $100 bonus.

===Disputes===
A large portion of online casino disputes relates to bonuses. Casinos may label players who win using bonuses as &quot;bonus abusers.&quot; Both players and casinos may commit fraud. An example of player fraud is creating multiple accounts and using the accounts to claim a sign-up bonus several times. An example of casino fraud is changing terms of a bonus after a player has completed the wagering requirements, then requiring the player to meet the new bonus terms.

==Legality==
Online gambling legislation often has loopholes that result from the rapid development of the technology underpinning the development of the industry. Some countries, including Belgium, Canada, Finland, Sweden and Poland have state gambling monopolies and do not grant licenses to foreign casino operators. According to their law, operators licensed on the territory of these countries can only be considered legal. At the same time, they can&#x27;t prosecute foreign casino operators and only block their sites. Players in these countries can&#x27;t be punished and can gamble at any site they can access.

===Australia===
The Australian Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) criminalizes the supply of online casino games by an operator anywhere in the world to persons located in Australia. It only targets operators of online gambling sites, resulting in the curious situation that it is not illegal for a player in Australia to access and gamble at an online casino. No operator has even been charged with an offense under the IGA and many online casinos accept Australian customers. In June 2016, the South Australian Government became the first state or territory in the world to introduce a 15% Place Of Consumption Tax (POCT) modeled on the 2014 UK POCT.

===Belgium===
The Belgian Gaming Act went into effect in January 2011 and allows online gambling, but only under very strict conditions and surveillance.
As of 2024, Belgium enforces a strict gambling regulatory framework managed by the Belgian Gaming Commission. This framework covers both land-based and online gambling, with a focus on licensing, consumer protection, and responsible gambling practices. Online operators must collaborate with land-based casinos to operate legally, and Belgium employs a &quot;white list&quot; for approved sites and a &quot;black list&quot; for unauthorized ones to control online gambling. The commission ensures operators comply with laws designed to balance gambling opportunities with the prevention of gambling-related issues.

===Canada===
The Canadian criminal code states that only provincial governments and charitable organizations licensed by provincial governments may operate a casino in Canada. It also prohibits residents from participating in any lottery scheme, the game of chance, or gambling activity not licensed or operated by a provincial government. In 2010, the British Columbia Lottery Corporation launched Canada’s first legal online casino, PlayNow, which is available to residents of British Columbia, and later expanded to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The province of Quebec operates the similar Espacejeux via Loto-Québec, while Ontario operates PlayOLG via Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).

The Kahnawake First Nation in Quebec has operated its own gaming commission since 1996 under the &quot;Kahnawake Gaming Law&quot;. It has asserted jurisdiction to enact the law as part of Mohawk or &quot;aboriginal rights&quot; that have existed since time immemorial, most recently recognized and affirmed in subsection 35(1) of Canada&#x27;s Constitution Act, 1982. As of 2010, it had licensed and hosted nearly 350 gambling websites, and its activities had never been challenged under the laws of Canada or any other jurisdiction.

In 2022 the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario allowed gaming providers to operate online gambling sites under a license with iGaming Ontario.

===Germany===
A German state contract about gambling (German: &quot;&quot;) between all 16 German states was ratified in 2008 and has been adopted in 2012. It regulates restrictive handling of online-gambling, including a basic state monopoly on public gambling with limited exceptions for a few commercial providers. Online gambling, and other forms of public gambling, against these regulations is illegal in Germany. The state contract, its implementation in contrast to the more lenient EU legislation, and possible further changes have been controversially discussed in the public, politics, and courts.

===India===
Online gambling is illegal in the state of Maharashtra under the &quot;Bombay Wager Act&quot;. The most recent law to address gambling online was the Federal Information Technology Rules where such illegal activities may be blocked by Internet providers within India. Another act is the Public Gaming Act of 1867. However, the Act makes no specific mention of “online casinos.” States tend to operate on their own authority. Online casinos active in India are run by international operators.

Online gambling legal issues in India are complicated in nature as Gambling in India is regulated by different states laws and online gambling is a central subject. To ascertain the position of Indian government, the Supreme Court of India sought the opinion of central government in this regard but the same was declined by the central government. This has made playing of online cards games like rummy, poker, etc. legally risky.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the Gambling Act 2005 governs all matters of online gambling, permitting online betting sites to have a Remote Gambling Licence in order to offer online betting to UK citizens. In 2014, the UK government put into law the Gambling Act of 2014 which in addition to the original 2005 law, required offshore online gambling operators catering to UK players to obtain a UK license. The new regulation required operators to pay a 15% Place of Consumption Tax (POCT), something that triggered an exodus of sorts of some operators from the UK Isles. However, this exodus did not last long in most cases as the benefits outweighed the stumbling blocks, due to the UK being a major market for online gambling.

In 2019 the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) announced a series of new measures that apply to online and mobile casinos to reduce underage gambling with the aim of increasing fairness and transparency. The new measures will require casinos to have users verify their identity and age in order to gamble.

===Spain===
As of 2024, gambling in Spain is legal and regulated under the Spanish Gambling Act of 2011, which oversees both online and offline gambling activities. This legislation requires operators to obtain a license from the Directorate General for the Regulation of Gambling (DGOJ) to offer services. The law emphasizes responsible gambling, including age verification and self-exclusion programs. While national regulations provide a general framework, some Spanish regions may impose additional rules, reflecting the country&#x27;s decentralized governance. Gambling winnings are subject to taxation, with conditions varying by the amount and type of game.

===Argentina===
As of 2024, gambling regulation in Argentina is primarily managed at the provincial level, with each of the 23 provinces and the autonomous city of Buenos Aires setting their own rules. This results in diverse gambling laws across the country. While national oversight exists for taxation and interstate gambling, there&#x27;s no unified federal regulation for online gambling, leaving it up to each province. Operators must obtain local licenses and follow regional guidelines, including responsible gambling measures. The decentralized system aims to protect consumers, address problem gambling, and support local economies through gambling taxes.

===United States===
In the United States, the legality of online gambling is debated and can vary from state to state. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) limits the ability of banks and payment processors to transact with internet gambling sites that are unlawful under any federal or state law. However, it does not define the legality or otherwise of an internet-based gambling site. It was commonly assumed that the Federal Wire Act prohibited all forms of online gambling. However, in December 2011, the United States Department of Justice released a statement clarifying that the Wire Act applied only to sports betting sites and not to online casinos, poker, or lottery sites, leaving the definition of legality up to individual states. Certain states such as Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have started the process of legalizing and regulating online gambling and it is expected that regulation will continue on a state by state basis.

<text>Suspenders (American English, Canadian English), or braces (British English, New Zealand English, Australian English) are fabric or leather straps worn over the shoulders to hold up skirts or trousers. The straps may be elasticated, either entirely or only at attachment ends, and most straps are of woven cloth forming an X or Y shape at the back. Suspenders are typically attached to skirts and trousers with clips or buttons using leather tabs at the ends.

In British English, a suspender belt, or suspenders for short, is a garment used to hold up stockings. This is called a garter belt in American English.

==History==

There have been several precursors to suspenders throughout the past 300 years, but modern suspenders were first popularised as &quot;braces&quot; in 1822 by a London haberdasher Albert Thurston. They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century skirts and trousers that made a belt impractical. During the nineteenth century, suspenders were sometimes called galluses. Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author Mark Twain, patented &quot;Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments&quot; (ADSG), becoming one of the first to receive a United States patent for suspenders in 1871.

After losing popularity during World War I, when men became accustomed to uniform belts, suspenders were still regular attire throughout the 1920s. Because of their image as &#x27;underwear&#x27;, some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests (US/Canada) or waistcoats which had hidden suspenders became worn less often. This also signaled the switch in the position of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. &quot;Life&quot; magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over suspenders. Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s revived suspenders, they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK they remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers.

==Fashion==
While suspenders have been in and out of fashion over the last century (alternating with belts in general preference), there has been a brief resurgence in interest, possibly due to the styles seen in films like &quot;Wall Street&quot;. Many business people, newscasters (such as Larry King in the United States) and professionals such as lawyers also still wear suspenders.

Narrow, clip-on style suspenders are also a typical part of skinhead, and to a lesser extent, punk fashion. In skinhead and punk fashion, suspenders are typically between in width.

Materials used for making suspenders have also changed over time, with newer additions such as rayon, a hard-wearing synthetic fibre, now offered. Generally, a high-quality rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create suspenders, with silk webbing or tubed suiting cloths from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used.

Suspenders can be measured in a variety of different ways to ensure proper fitting. To accurately measure suspenders, first, start by measuring from the back pant line, then cross over the opposite shoulder down to the front pant line. Add a few additional inches for adjustments when required.

==Usage==
Good quality smart suspenders were traditionally considered white collar, or upper or upper-middle class, wear. They were made to be attached to skirts or trousers by buttons sewn onto the waistband. There are relatively few current manufacturers in the UK, but the classic button-on &#x27;reform&#x27; end is also quite widely available in the United States.

In traditional or formal settings, it is considered a &quot;&quot; to wear both belt and suspenders at the same time, though in the past this has not always been the case. Further, suspenders were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen. From the time of their invention until World War II, the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered suspenders to prevent indecency. Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few &#x27;die-hards&#x27; still consider it &quot;&quot; to wear, for example, brightly colored suspenders without a jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, on both sides of the Atlantic, for men&#x27;s suspenders to be seen.

The trousers for suspenders have buttons in order to attach the leather tabs; these may be either on the outside, traditionally, or inside of trousers that do not have belt loops. With belt loops, buttons would be sewn on the inside of the waistband. Such trousers might also have a high back in the &quot;fishtail&quot; shape, though this is not as common now; This style may also have an additional adjustable strap at the back, as well as the two side adjusters placed on most belt-less trousers. Buttons should be placed about apart, an equal distance from the back seam. At the front, the first button should be set over the main pleat or crease, the second button again about apart. It is important to place the buttons in the correct position, as trousers with suspenders should be slightly loose to hang correctly.

In the 2000s, it became fashionable for some younger women to wear suspenders, a style that emerged from Mod styles in the late 1960s through to punk rock and skinhead styles of the late 1970s into the 1980s. One particular exponent of this fashion was Eurythmics vocalist Annie Lennox, whose fashion styling was akin to cross-dressing as a male character, with her dark suit and red suspenders.

<doc id="701781" wikidata="Q1141727" url="?curid=701781" title="Rob Roy (1995 film)">
<text>Rob Roy is a 1995 historical biographical drama film directed by Michael Caton-Jones. It stars Liam Neeson as Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th-century Scottish highlander who becomes engaged in a dispute with a nobleman in the Scottish Highlands, played by John Hurt. Tim Roth won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Archibald Cunningham, one of Rob Roy&#x27;s chief antagonists. Jessica Lange portrays Roy&#x27;s wife, and Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox, and Jason Flemyng play supporting parts.

The film is dedicated to two Scotsmen: film director Alexander MacKendrick and football player and manager Jock Stein.

==Plot==
The film is set in Scotland, 1713, with a fictionalised Robert Roy MacGregor, of Clan MacGregor, as its main protagonist. Although providing the Lowland gentry with protection against cattle rustling, he barely manages to feed his people. Hoping to alleviate their hunger and his poverty, MacGregor borrows £1,000 from James Graham, Marquess of Montrose, to establish himself as a cattle raiser and trader.

Wanting to leave England to flee legal troubles, his anglicized aristocrat relative Archibald Cunningham is sent to stay with Montrose. Cunningham is a supremely skilled swordsman, so Montrose makes money off Cunningham by making wagers on sword contests that Cunningham&#x27;s haughty manner and effeminate bearing bring upon himself. Cunningham learns about MacGregor&#x27;s money deal from Montrose&#x27;s factor Killearn, and murders MacGregor&#x27;s friend, Alan McDonald, to steal the money. MacGregor requests time from Montrose to find McDonald and the money. Montrose offers to waive the debt if MacGregor will testify falsely that Montrose&#x27;s rival John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll is a Jacobite. MacGregor refuses and Montrose vows to imprison him in the tolbooth until the debt is repaid. After MacGregor flees, Montrose seizes MacGregor&#x27;s land to cover the debt, declaring him an outlaw and ordering Cunningham to bring him in &quot;broken, but not dead&quot;. Redcoats slaughter MacGregor&#x27;s cattle, burn his croft, and Cunningham rapes his wife Mary.

Mary understands that Cunningham intends to flush her husband out of hiding and makes his brother, Alasdair, who arrives too late to save her, swear to conceal knowledge of the rape. MacGregor refuses to permit his clan to wage war on Montrose, and instead decrees to harm Montrose financially. Betty, a maidservant at Montrose&#x27;s estate, has become pregnant with Cunningham&#x27;s child. When Killearn tells Montrose, Betty is dismissed from service and rejected by Cunningham. Betty seeks refuge with the MacGregors, revealing that she overheard Killearn and Cunningham plot to steal the money. To build a case against Cunningham, MacGregor abducts Killearn and imprisons him upon Factor&#x27;s Island in Loch Katrine. Mary promises Killearn that he will be spared if he testifies against Cunningham, but Killearn taunts her with her rape. Realizing that Mary is pregnant, he threatens to tell MacGregor that Cunningham may be the father if she does not release him, leading Mary and Alasdair to kill him.

Montrose tells Cunningham that he suspects who really stole the money but does not care. Cunningham and the redcoats burn the Clan&#x27;s crofts. MacGregor refuses to take the bait, but Alasdair attempts to snipe Cunningham and hits a redcoat. The redcoats shoot both Alasdair and another Clan member, Coll. Alasdair finally tells MacGregor about Mary&#x27;s rape. Taken prisoner, MacGregor accuses Cunningham of murder, robbery and rape. Cunningham confirms the charges, and gleefully beats and tortures MacGregor. The following morning, Montrose orders MacGregor hanged from a nearby bridge. MacGregor loops the rope binding his hands around Cunningham&#x27;s throat and then jumps off the bridge; he escapes when the rope is cut to save Cunningham.

Mary gains an audience with the Duke of Argyll and exposes Montrose&#x27;s plan to frame him. Moved by MacGregor&#x27;s integrity, the Duke grants the family asylum on his estate at Glen Shira. MacGregor arrives, at first upset by Mary&#x27;s unwillingness to inform him of her rape or her pregnancy but later willing to raise the child as his own. The Duke arranges a duel between MacGregor and Cunningham, wagering Montrose that if MacGregor lives, his debt will be forgiven and that if he dies, the Duke will pay his debt. Montrose agrees and Cunningham and MacGregor vow that no quarter will be asked or given. Armed with a light and swift small sword-like rapier, Cunningham repeatedly wounds MacGregor, who appears to quickly exhaust himself swinging a heavy broadsword. MacGregor seems defeated, but when Cunningham showboats to deliver a theatrical killing blow, MacGregor seizes his enemy&#x27;s sword-point. As Cunningham struggles to free his blade, one stroke from MacGregor&#x27;s broadsword splits Cunningham&#x27;s torso. Now free of debts and with his honor intact, he returns home to his wife and children.

==Production==
According to screenwriter Alan Sharp, Rob Roy was conceived as a Western set in the Scottish Highlands.

The film was shot entirely on location in Scotland, much of it in parts of the Highlands so remote they had to be reached by helicopter. Some of the scenes were filmed in Glen Coe, Glen Nevis, and Glen Tarbert. In the opening scenes, Rob and his men pass by Loch Leven. Loch Morar stood in for Loch Lomond, on the banks of which the real Rob Roy lived. Scenes of the Duke of Argyll&#x27;s estate were shot at Castle Tioram, the Marquess of Montrose&#x27;s at Drummond Castle. Shots of &quot;The Factor&#x27;s Inn&quot; were filmed outside Megginch Castle. Crichton Castle was used in a landscape shot.

Non-stop Highland rain presented a problem for cast and crew when filming outdoor shots, as did the resulting swarms of midges.

William Hobbs choreographed the swordfights, with Robert G. Goodwin consulting.

The main composer is Carter Burwell. Beside the film score, the film features a slightly different version of a traditional Gaelic song called &quot;Ailein duinn&quot;, sung in the film by Karen Matheson, lead singer in Capercaillie.

==Historical accuracy==
Details of Rob Roy&#x27;s life are a mix of fact and legend, and according to one historian, the film portrays Rob Roy &quot;in the most sympathetic light possible&quot;. Not all of the events shown in the film were real. The narration covers approximately the years 1712 to 1722; nevertheless the uprisings of 1715 and 1719 were not depicted in the film.

MacGregor had business dealings with Montrose for ten years before the loan of £1000 went missing. Though called the Marquess of Montrose, James Graham, 4th Marquess of Montrose had already been elevated to Duke of Montrose at this point in history. He was raised to the dukedom as a reward for his support for the Act of Union, whilst being Lord President of the Scottish Privy Council.

The character of Cunningham is fictional, though certainly based upon Henry Cunningham Esq. of Boquhan, described by Sir Walter Scott as a &quot;daring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners amounting to foppery,&quot; who nonetheless seized a sword and &quot;rushed on the outlaw with such unexpected fury that he fairly drove him off the field.&quot; 

The uniforms of the English soldiers derive from an era after the story told. At that time the coattails were longer in size and had not yet been turned back. The regiments were not numbered until 1751, but in the movie the backs of the mitre caps of the grenadiers show clearly the number 49 (for the 49th Regiment of Foot). However, this regiment was only put up in 1743, long after the story described.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Rob Roy&quot; received a generally positive critical response. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 73% based on reviews from 44 critics, with an average score of 6.4 out of 10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Rob Roy&quot; is an old-fashioned swashbuckler that benefits greatly from fine performances by Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, and Tim Roth.&quot; On Metacritic it has an average score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 19 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, said, &quot;This is a splendid, rousing historical adventure, an example of what can happen when the best direction, acting, writing and technical credits are brought to bear on what might look like shopworn material.&quot; Ebert said the film&#x27;s outline could have led to &quot;yet another tired&quot; historical epic, but he found that the director was able to produce &quot;intense character studies&quot;. The critic applauded Tim Roth&#x27;s performance, calling it &quot;crucial&quot; to the film&#x27;s success. Ebert was also impressed by the climactic sword fighting scene, which had been choreographed by fight director William Hobbs, and called it &quot;one of the great action sequences in movie history&quot;. His partner Gene Siskel agreed, calling it the &quot;best sword fight in motion picture history.&quot;

In contrast, Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared &quot;Rob Roy&quot; negatively to the action films &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974) and &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982). Kempley disliked the film&#x27;s violence and wrote, &quot;Frankly, Rob Roy is about as bright as one of his cows. He doesn&#x27;t even recognize that his obsession with honor will lead to the destruction of his clan.&quot; The critic found the protagonist unheroic in his mission for vengeance. Of his enemy, she said, &quot;The villains, played with glee, manage to perk up the glacial pace, but they too grow tiresome.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin gave a mixed review of the film. She complained of the film&#x27;s &quot;long, dry stretches&quot; and that the &quot;plot [was] too ponderous and uninteresting for the film&#x27;s visual sweep&quot;. Maslin said one of the film&#x27;s saving graces was the &quot;robust&quot; presence of Liam Neeson, taller than those who played his enemies, and his character&#x27;s charismatic exchange with Jessica Lange&#x27;s character, writing, &quot;&quot;Rob Roy&quot; is best watched for local color and for its hearty, hot-blooded stars.&quot; Maslin acknowledged that Neeson was &quot;a far cry from the dour-looking Scottish drover who was the real Rob Roy&quot; and said that the film failed to convey the figure&#x27;s importance to audiences. The critic highlighted the scene of Cunningham raping Mary as one of the film&#x27;s &quot;strongest scenes&quot; which was appropriately responded to by the &quot;cowboy justice&quot; of Neeson&#x27;s lonesome and avenging Rob Roy.

<text>The Living Tribunal is a cosmic entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #157 (June 1967) and was created by Stan Lee, Marie Severin, and Herb Trimpe.

==Publication history==
The Living Tribunal debuted in a storyline called &quot;The Sands of Death&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #157–163 (June–December 1967), giving mystic hero Doctor Strange a limited time to prove Earth is worth saving. Established as apparently the supreme power in the Marvel Universe, the character made several sporadic appearances over the years, including &quot;What If&quot; #32 (April 1982); &quot;Rom&quot; #41 (April 1983) and &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #6 (December 1985). The Living Tribunal revealed clues as to its true purpose and nature in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; (vol. 3) #31 (December 1989).

After brief appearances in the role of observer in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; #16 (September 1991) and &quot;Quasar&quot; #26 (Sept. 1991), the character had a significant role in the limited series &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (July–December 1991), &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #1 (February 1992), and &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; #1–4 (April–May 1996). The Living Tribunal&#x27;s role was eventually expanded on in &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #12 (November 2006).

The Living Tribunal was featured in the 2003&#x27;s storyline. The character also made an appearance during the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, and battled Beyonders.

==Fictional character biography==
The Living Tribunal is an entity that oversees and maintains balance in the realities that constitute the Marvel Comics Multiverse, including the mainstream universe and all alternate universes. He serves as a judge of these realities.

The character is first encountered by Doctor Strange, announcing its intent to destroy Earth due to its potential for evil. After a series of trials, Doctor Strange is able to convince the Living Tribunal that good also exists, and Earth is spared. The Tribunal reappears to the Galadorian spaceknight Rom; appears briefly with the rest of the cosmic hierarchy when in discussion with the entity the Beyonder; and reveals to the former Herald of Galactus (the Silver Surfer) that its three faces represent &quot;Equity&quot; (hooded face), &quot;Vengeance&quot; (partially shrouded face), and &quot;Necessity&quot; (fully shrouded face). The fourth side of the Living Tribunal&#x27;s head is a void, with the entity claiming that the cosmic entity the Stranger once existed as this part of its being. The character also witnesses the triumph of the hero Quasar—acting as the avatar of cosmic entity Infinity—over the villain Maelstrom, who acts for the entity Oblivion.

During &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot;, the Tribunal teamed up with the Spectre to save their worlds from the two cosmic brothers&#x27; attempts to destroy one of the two multiverses. Their pact, with the help of Access, created the Amalgam multiverse by merging the two multiverses, to &quot;buy some time&quot;. As the new Amalgam multiverse was unstable, the former multiverses are restored. The struggle of &quot;The Brothers&quot; continues until the efforts of Batman and Captain America against them make them realize they both &quot;Did Well&quot;, and the multiverses are spared.

The Living Tribunal&#x27;s power is virtually limitless, as the entity prevents the Infinity Gems from being used in unison, although it remains subservient to a single, even higher entity referred to as &quot;One-Above-All&quot; (not to be confused with the celestial also called the One Above All). The entity has representatives called &quot;The Magistrati&quot; who dispense judgments by request on alien worlds, and chose to reveal the previously unseen face of &quot;Necessity&quot; to She-Hulk as a reflection of her own face, stating that the face is a &quot;Cosmic Mirror which reminds us to always judge others as we would have ourselves judged&quot;.

Iron Man and the Watcher later find what appears to be the Living Tribunal&#x27;s withered corpse on the moon, with no sign of who killed it.

When Yellowjacket ventured into the Multiverse during the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, the cause of his death was discovered: the Living Tribunal had died fighting the Beyonders while attempting to halt the annihilation of the Marvel Multiverse.

An alternative version of Adam Warlock later took up the Living Tribunal&#x27;s vacant position, on orders from the One-Above-All (here called &quot;Above-All-Others&quot;).

After the devourer of worlds Galactus evolves into a lifebringer, Lord Chaos and Master Order consider this to throw the cosmic hierarchy out of balance, and ask the new Living Tribunal to render judgment. However, when the Tribunal decides in favor of a &quot;new balance for a new cosmos&quot;, Order and Chaos join forces to seemingly kill the entity. The Living Tribunal is later resurrected and seen taking Lord Chaos and Master Order to judgment after the defeat of the First Firmament.

==Powers and abilities==
Thanos wielding the Infinity Gauntlet ranked the Tribunal&#x27;s power as the highest in Marvel&#x27;s regular multiversal hierarchy. However, the Tribunal has also referred to a higher entity that vastly eclipses its own power, and was killed by the Beyonders.

The Living Tribunal was the embodiment of the Marvel Multiverse, and the sum totality of all the abstract entities within it. Nonetheless, the Tribunal is not as powerful as the multiversal incarnation of Eternity and was referred to as an internal function of the entity.

==In other media==
* Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the screenwriters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, revealed that the Living Tribunal was originally planned to have an appearance in the latter, in which they would have judged Thanos for his crimes against the universe, including &quot;The Blip&quot;.
* The Living Tribunal makes a cameo appearance in the MCU film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;.

<doc id="701798" wikidata="Q2721152" url="?curid=701798" title="Gamora">
<text>Gamora is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/artist Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #180 (June 1975). Gamora is the adopted daughter of Thanos, and the last of her species. Her powers include superhuman strength and agility and an accelerated healing factor. She also is an elite combatant, being able to beat most of the opponents in the galaxy. She is a member of the superhero group known as the Infinity Watch. The character played a role in the 2007 crossover storyline &quot;&quot;, becoming a member of the titular team in its spin-off comic, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, before becoming the supervillain Requiem in the 2018 crossover storylines &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; and &quot;Infinity Wars&quot;.

Gamora has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise. Zoe Saldaña played the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;&quot; (2018), additionally portraying a version of the character from an alternate timeline in &quot;&quot; (2019) and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). Ariana Greenblatt portrayed a young Gamora in &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot;.

==Creation==
Starlin commented on the character&#x27;s creation stating, &quot;She&#x27;s the straight man for the Pips and the Draxes and the what have you, which doesn&#x27;t make her the most interesting character, but makes her essential to get the rest of the story moving. So I always treated her as such. I had one story in particular, one Infinity Watch story, where she tries to show everyone how much of an adult she is by dealing with these U.N. soldiers who eventually piss her off, and she wrecks everything, disproving her point entirely. But most of the time she&#x27;s the solid one, the one that brings everyone back to the reality they should be at. I&#x27;ve always used her as a supporting character. She was created as a supporting character. I have a limit on how much work I can do, so I never shot off on thinking about solo adventures with her. Even when she wasn&#x27;t in a group, she was always a supporting character for Adam Warlock. I&#x27;m sure I could find those hooks that would make a solo story, I&#x27;ve just never done it. She probably works either way, but I&#x27;ve only ever used her one way.&quot;

==Publication history==
The character debuted in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #180 (1975), and was created by Jim Starlin. She returned in issue #181, &quot;Warlock&quot; #9, 10, 11 and 15 (1975-1976), and in the 1977 annuals for &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;. In 1990, she returned in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 #46-47. She had a minor role in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1-6 (1991) and co-starred in &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #1-42 (1992-1995). She was also featured in the &quot;Infinity War&quot; (1992) and &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot; (1993) crossovers. After appearing in &quot;Infinity Abyss&quot; #1-6 (2002), &quot;Annihilation: Ronan&quot; #1-4 (2006), &quot;Annihilation&quot; #1-6 (2006), Annihilation: Conquest #6 (2008) and &quot;Nova&quot; vol. 4 #4-12 (2007-2008), Gamora costarred in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 2 #1-25 (2008-2010). She played a minor role in &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; #1-6 (2010).

The character, along with the other Guardians, appears in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; issues #4-8 (2012). She stars in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch, and in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 4. Parts of her origin story were told in a 2017 series titled &quot;Gamora&quot; that lasted five issues and were collected into the graphic novel &quot;Gamora: Memento Mori&quot; (2017). While being set on Earth-616, it retcons some elements of the established continuity to match the movie version.

==Fictional character biography==
Gamora is the last of her species, the Zen-Whoberis, who were exterminated by the Badoon (in her original timeline, her species was exterminated by the Universal Church of Truth). Thanos found her as a child and decided to use her as a weapon. Gamora was raised and trained by Thanos to assassinate the Magus, the evil, future version of Adam Warlock. Thanos showed her little kindness during her childhood, but Gamora was very loyal to the man who promised her the opportunity to avenge the death of her family. Gamora became very proficient in martial arts, earning the nickname &quot;The deadliest woman in the whole galaxy&quot;. When she was a teenager, Thanos took her on a trip to Tartoonla #7. Gamora disobeyed Thanos&#x27;s orders, and due to this, came into conflict with a group of thugs. She was greatly outnumbered, and despite her skills, she was defeated and then raped by the assailants. Thanos found her half dead, and in turn, murdered all of her assailants and restored her to health, cybernetically enhancing her to superhuman levels.

As an adult, Gamora was sent as an assassin against the Universal Church of Truth, quickly becoming feared by its agents, the Black Knights. She exacted revenge for the genocide of her race by killing every member of the church involved before the event occurred. Gamora met and teamed up with Adam Warlock, who wanted to stop his future, evil self. She even managed to get close to the Magus but failed her assassination in the last second. Together with Warlock, Pip the Troll and Thanos, Gamora fought to escape the Black Knights of the Universal Church of Truth and Magus&#x27;s Death Squad. She was then assigned by Thanos to protect Adam Warlock, but she became suspicious of Thanos&#x27;s plans, and was then attacked by Drax the Destroyer.

Eventually the Magus was defeated, but Thanos revealed himself as a greater threat. Gamora aided Captain Mar-Vell, Drax, and the Avengers against Thanos. Gamora and Pip tried to prevent Thanos from destroying half of all the life in the universe. Gamora attempted to slay Thanos, but he mortally wounded her, and destroyed Pip&#x27;s mind. Adam Warlock found them, and Gamora warned Adam of Thanos&#x27;s plans, and Adam absorbed their souls into his Soul Gem. When Adam Warlock died as well, his spirit reunited with his friends in the world within the Soul Gem.

===Infinity Watch===
Inside the Soul Gem was Soul World, a place where Gamora, Pip and eventually Adam Warlock himself lived at peace. Other beings who had been absorbed by the Soul Gem, such as Kray-Tor and Autolycus, also lived in peace with former enemies.

Gamora met the Silver Surfer when he traveled to Soul World, and also battled Drax the Destroyer.

When Thanos managed to obtain all the Infinity Gems, forming the Infinity Gauntlet, Adam Warlock decided that he must be stopped. Warlock led Gamora and Pip the Troll out of Soul World into the real world. Their souls took over the bodies of three humans, who had recently died in a car crash. Gamora thus returned to the corporeal world by taking possession of the body of Bambi Long, whose body then began transforming into a duplicate of Gamora&#x27;s original body. However, Gamora was soon erased from existence by Thanos when he erased half the population in the universe. When Nebula claimed the Gauntlet from Thanos, Gamora returned to existence.

Warlock now had the Infinity Gauntlet, giving him near omnipotence. Gamora and Pip persuaded Doctor Strange to help them find and stop Warlock, who was going mad with power. The Living Tribunal intervened and Warlock divided the Infinity Gems among several guardians, known as the Infinity Watch. Gamora received the Time Gem, but was incapable of consciously using it, though it did give her sporadic precognitive dreams and visions. Gamora had become romantically interested in Adam, but Adam did not respond to her. In an argument over the Infinity Watch member Maxam, Gamora left the Infinity Watch and the Time Gem behind. She returned to work as a mercenary until Adam Warlock approached her again. They continued to travel together and eventually Adam reciprocated her love. Adam and Gamora remained in a pocket dimension to raise the cosmic being known as Atleza.

===Annihilation===

Gamora later reappears in the pages of &quot;Ronan&quot;, having left the company of Adam Warlock and settled on the world Godthab Omega as leader of a group of female warriors called The Graces, where her mind has been altered by Glorian. She is intent on re-establishing her reputation as the deadliest woman in the universe and now wields the &quot;Godslayer&quot; sword. At one point, she is seen reclining on a &#x27;throne&#x27; made of corpses. She joins the United Front, using her skills to launch quick counterattacks against the Annihilation Wave. She engages in a sexual relationship with the United Front&#x27;s leader, Nova.

During the Phalanx&#x27;s invasion of the Kree home-world following the Annihilation War, Gamora is assimilated as a &quot;select&quot; of the hive mind. They dispatch her to apprehend Nova after he flees the planet. She is later freed by Nova and the Technarch Tyro, but left in severe distress, longing again for the sense of companionship brought by the Phalanx, and continuing to adopt her Phalanx mannerisms.

She joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy.

Gamora was taken prisoner by Magus when he faked the death of himself and several other Guardians. She was rescued by Star-Lord and played a minor role in the war with the &quot;Cancerverse&quot;.

She later appears on Earth to aid the Avengers against Thanos.

During the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, Gamora was seen with Moon Knight and Winter Soldier&#x27;s group, investigating the murder of Uatu the Watcher.

===Countdown to Infinity===
Later, Gamora was confronted in her dreams by an elderly version of herself who turned out to be a part of her which had remained trapped in the Soul Stone after she left its internal paradise. This gave Gamora a motivation to recover the Soul Stone at whatever cost. When the Guardians of the Galaxy find the Power Stone, Gamora pleads with Star-Lord to let her use the Stone so she could get the Soul Stone and recover the piece of her soul trapped within it. Quill refuses and Gamora leaves him with a parting kiss.

===Infinity Wars===
After experiencing reoccurring dreams concerning encounters with an older version of herself, Gamora realizes that a portion of her soul is trapped inside the Soul World. After obtaining the Infinity Gems, Gamora takes the name &quot;Requiem&quot; and kills Thanos before using the Gems to fuse every being in the universe with one another to appease Devondra, a spider-like entity who lives in Soul World. Ultimately, Gamora is defeated and sent to another planet alongside a resurrected Magus, while the merged universe is preserved as a pocket dimension inside the Soul Gem.

===The Final Gauntlet===
When it was learned from Thanos&#x27; will that he plans to resurrect himself by uploading his consciousness into an unrevealed being, many assumed it was Gamora. So, Gamora&#x27;s uncle Starfox formed the Dark Guardians to prevent this. Gamora was on Halfworld at the time keeping an eye on ex-Guardian Rocket Raccoon. She was later picked up by the Guardians to protect her from harm. However, the Dark Guardians followed Gamora&#x27;s ex-lover Nova, knowing that he would search for her and warn her of their intent. Once Nova found Gamora, the Dark Guardians attacked Nova and the Guardians, forcing them to crash-land on an unnamed planet. After subduing the Guardians and Nova, the Dark Guardians took Gamora prisoner.

As the Dark Guardians were about to kill Gamora, they were attacked by Hela and the Black Order who planned to resurrect Thanos. Hela then revealed that Thanos planned to come back in Starfox&#x27;s body, not Gamora&#x27;s. Thanos&#x27; consciousness took control of Starfox shortly after. When the Guardians arrived to rescue Gamora, they found Gamora surrounded by the Dark Guardians, who explained what happened.

Gamora rejoined the Guardians who with the remaining Dark Guardians attacked Hela&#x27;s hideout in Knowhere to stop Thanos&#x27; resurrection. While Thanos was transferring his consciousness from Starfox&#x27;s body into his, Gamora stabbed Starfox with a sword to stop it. However, this only caused Thanos to be brought back with a broken mind. When Thanos was accidentally hit with a missile that generated a black hole, Thanos, Hela, and Knowhere were sucked up while the Guardians and Dark Guardians escaped.

==Powers and abilities==
Gamora received treatments from Thanos that enhanced her speed, strength, agility, and durability to rival Adam Warlock&#x27;s (to better slay the Magus, his evil, future self). Thanos also helped her become a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the martial-arts techniques from various planets, in the uses of the known weaponry of the Milky Way galaxy, and stealth techniques. She is also a highly skilled gymnast and assassin, and formerly possessed a telepathic link to Thanos. She uses a wide variety of weaponry, most notably a dagger whose unknown properties made it capable of slaying even beings of such immense power as Thanos and the Magus.

In the pages of &quot;Infinity Watch&quot;, it is revealed that Gamora had been cybernetically enhanced to have superhuman strength, speed, and a rapid-healing ability. Gamora&#x27;s strength and speed were further enhanced by Adam Warlock when they returned from Soulworld.

Gamora possesses a regenerative healing factor, allowing her to recover more quickly.

Gamora is one of the most skilled martial artists in the Marvel Universe. She is capable of defeating opponents who possess superhuman strength and durability that far surpass her own, and she has defeated a military platoon containing dozens of combat-trained men in only a few minutes. She has learned to paralyze or kill opponents using vital-point strikes directed at certain nerve clusters. Although skilled in the use of most conventional weapons, she prefers to use knives and swords.

While Gamora was with the Infinity Watch, she possessed the Infinity Gem called the &quot;Time Gem&quot;. The gem was mentally linked to her, giving her the potential power to control time. She said that she did not know how to employ its powers and preferred not to use it. While she possessed the Time Gem, Gamora was prone to precognitive dreams and visions, though she had no conscious control over them. Later, despite no longer possessing the gem, she was claimed to retain some measure of this capability at the time of the Phalanx conquest.

<doc id="701802" wikidata="Q1131462" url="?curid=701802" title="United States House Committee on the Judiciary">
<text>The U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, also called the House Judiciary Committee, is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives. It is charged with overseeing the administration of justice within the federal courts, federal administrative agencies, and federal law enforcement entities. The Judiciary Committee is often involved in the impeachment process against federal officials. Because of the legal nature of its oversight, committee members usually have a legal background, but this is not required.

In the 118th Congress, the chairman of the committee is Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio, and the ranking minority member is Democrat Jerry Nadler of New York.

== History ==

The committee was created on June 3, 1813, for the purpose of considering legislation related to the judicial system. This committee approved impeachment resolutions/articles of impeachment against presidents in four instances: against Andrew Johnson (in 1867), Richard Nixon (in 1974), Bill Clinton (in 1998), and Donald Trump (in 2019).

In the 115th Congress, the chairman of the committee was Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, and the ranking minority member was initially Democrat John Conyers of Michigan. On November 26, 2017, Conyers stepped down from his position as ranking member, while he faced an ethics investigation. On November 28, 2017, Jerrold Nadler of New York was named as acting ranking member.

In the 116th Congress, the House flipped from Republican to Democratic control. Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia&#x27;s 9th congressional district, became ranking member and served from 2019 to 2020. In early 2020, Collins stepped down from his leadership position when he became a candidate in the 2020 special election held to replace retiring U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson. Under House Republican rules, members must relinquish leadership positions if they launch a bid for another office. Collins was succeeded as ranking member by Jordan, who represents Ohio&#x27;s 4th congressional district, but who has never taken a bar examination or practiced law.

== Task forces ==
=== Antitrust Task Force: 108th Congress ===
Chairman: Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI); Ranking member: John Conyers (D-MI)

The Antitrust Task Force during the 108th Congress existed from March 26, 2003, to September 26, 2003. All Judiciary Committee Members also served as members of the Task Force, and conducted hearings and investigations into consolidation of the Bell Telephone Companies.

=== Antitrust Task Force: 110th Congress ===
Chairman: John Conyers (D-MI); Ranking member: Steve Chabot (R-OH)

The Antitrust Task Force during the 110th Congress was established February 28, 2007, as a temporary subcommittee to examine the pending merger between XM Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. The task force operated like any other subcommittee, except that it only has a six-month term. House Rules limit each full committee to just five subcommittees, and any task force, special subcommittee, or other subunit of a standing committee that is established for a cumulative period longer than six months in a Congress counts against that total. A longer term for the task force would cause the Judiciary Committee to exceed this limit.

=== Judicial Impeachment: 110th and 111th Congresses ===
Chairman: Adam Schiff (D-CA) Ranking member: Bob Goodlatte  (R-VA)

Established in September 2008, the Judicial Task force on Judicial Impeachment was to look into charges against District Judge Thomas Porteous. The investigation was not completed by the end of the 110th Congress, and it was reestablished after the 111th Congress convened in January 2009. The responsibilities of the Task Force were expanded to include the case of Judge Samuel B. Kent, leading to hearings and his subsequent impeachment by the full House of Representatives. The Task force finally voted to impeach Porteous on January 21, 2010.

<text>Children&#x27;s rights or the rights of children are a subset of human rights with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to minors. The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) defines a child as &quot;any human being below the age of eighteen years, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.&quot; Children&#x27;s rights includes their right to association with both parents, human identity as well as the basic needs for physical protection, food, universal state-paid education, health care, and criminal laws appropriate for the age and development of the child, equal protection of the child&#x27;s civil rights, and freedom from discrimination on the basis of the child&#x27;s race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability, color, ethnicity, or other characteristics. 

Interpretations of children&#x27;s rights range from allowing children the capacity for autonomous action to the enforcement of children being physically, mentally and emotionally free from abuse, though what constitutes &quot;abuse&quot; is a matter of debate. Other definitions include the rights to care and nurturing. There are no definitions of other terms used to describe young people such as &quot;adolescents&quot;, &quot;teenagers&quot;, or &quot;youth&quot; in international law, but the children&#x27;s rights movement is considered distinct from the youth rights movement. The field of children&#x27;s rights spans the fields of law, politics, religion, and morality.

== Justifications ==


As minors by law, children do not have autonomy or the right to make decisions on their own for themselves in any known jurisdiction of the world. Instead their adult caregivers, including parents, social workers, teachers, youth workers, and others, are vested with that authority, depending on the circumstances. Some believe that this state of affairs gives children insufficient control over their own lives and causes them to be vulnerable. Louis Althusser has gone so far as to describe this legal machinery, as it applies to children, as &quot;repressive state apparatuses&quot;.

Structures such as government policy have been held by some commentators to mask the ways adults abuse and exploit children, resulting in child poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and child labour. On this view, children are to be regarded as a minority group towards whom society needs to reconsider the way it behaves.

Researchers have identified children as needing to be recognized as participants in society whose rights and responsibilities need to be recognized at all ages.

== Historic definitions of children&#x27;s rights ==

Sir William Blackstone (1765-9) recognized three parental duties to the child: maintenance, protection, and education. In modern language, the child has a right to receive these from the parent.

The League of Nations adopted the &quot;Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child&quot; (1924), which enunciated the child&#x27;s right to receive the requirements for normal development, the right of the hungry child to be fed, the right of the sick child to receive health care, the right of the backward child to be reclaimed, the right of orphans to shelter, and the right to protection from exploitation.

The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) in Article 25(2) recognized the need of motherhood and childhood to &quot;special protection and assistance&quot; and the right of all children to &quot;social protection&quot;.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted the &quot;United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child&quot; (1959), which enunciated ten principles for the protection of children&#x27;s rights, including the universality of rights, the right to special protection, and the right to protection from discrimination, among other rights.

Consensus on defining children&#x27;s rights has become clearer in the last fifty years. A 1973 publication by Hillary Clinton (then an attorney) stated that children&#x27;s rights were a &quot;slogan in need of a definition&quot;. According to some researchers, the notion of children&#x27;s rights is still not well defined, with at least one proposing that there is no singularly accepted definition or theory of the rights held by children.

Children&#x27;s rights law is defined as the point where the law intersects with a child&#x27;s life. That includes juvenile delinquency, due process for children involved in the criminal justice system, appropriate representation, and effective rehabilitative services; care and protection for children in state care; ensuring education for all children regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability, color, ethnicity, or other characteristics, and; health care and advocacy.

==Classification==

Children have two types of human rights under international human rights law. They have the same fundamental general human rights as adults, although some human rights, such as the &quot;right to marry&quot;, are dormant until they are of age, Secondly, they have special human rights that are necessary to protect them during their minority. General rights operative in childhood include the &quot;right to security of the person&quot;, &quot;to freedom from inhuman, cruel, or degrading treatment&quot;, and the &quot;right to special protection during childhood&quot;. Particular human rights of children include, among other rights, the &quot;right to life&quot;, the &quot;right to a name&quot;, the &quot;right to express his views in matters concerning the child&quot;, the &quot;right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion&quot;, the &quot;right to health care&quot;, the &quot;right to protection from economic and sexual exploitation&quot;, and the &quot;right to education&quot;.

Children&#x27;s rights are defined in numerous ways, including a wide spectrum of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Rights tend to be of two general types: those advocating for children as autonomous persons under the law and those placing a claim on society for protection from harms perpetrated on children because of their dependency. These have been labeled as the &quot;right of empowerment&quot; and as the &quot;right to protection&quot;.

United Nations educational guides for children classify the rights outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the &quot;3 Ps&quot;: Provision, Protection, and Participation. They may be elaborated as follows:

* Provision: Children have the right to an adequate standard of living, health care, education and services, and to play and recreation. These include a balanced diet, a warm bed to sleep in, and access to schooling.
* Protection: Children have the right to protection from abuse, neglect, exploitation and discrimination. This includes the right to safe places for children to play; constructive child rearing behavior, and acknowledgment of the evolving capacities of children.
* Participation: Children have the right to participate in communities and have programs and services for themselves. This includes children&#x27;s involvement in libraries and community programs, youth voice activities, and involving children as decision-makers.

In a similar fashion, the Child Rights International Network (CRIN) categorizes rights into two groups:
* Economic, social and cultural rights, related to the conditions necessary to meet basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, health care, and gainful employment. Included are rights to education, adequate housing, food, water, the highest attainable standard of health, the right to work and rights at work, as well as the cultural rights of minorities and indigenous peoples.
* Environmental, cultural and developmental rights, which are sometimes called &quot;third generation rights&quot;, and including the right to live in safe and healthy environments and that groups of people have the right to cultural, political, and economic development.

Amnesty International openly advocates four particular children&#x27;s rights, including the end to juvenile incarceration without parole, an end to the recruitment of military use of children, ending the death penalty for people under 21, and raising awareness of human rights in the classroom. Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy organization, includes child labour, juvenile justice, orphans and abandoned children, refugees, street children and corporal punishment.

Scholarly study generally focuses children&#x27;s rights by identifying individual rights. The following rights &quot;allow children to grow up healthy and free&quot;:
* Freedom of speech
* Freedom of thought
* Freedom from fear
* Freedom of choice and the right to make decisions
* Ownership over one&#x27;s body

===Physical rights===

A report by the Committee on Social Affairs, Health, and Sustainable Development of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe identified several areas the Committee was concerned about, including procedures such as &quot;female genital mutilation, the circumcision of young boys for religious reasons, early childhood medical interventions in the case of intersex children and the submission to or coercion of children into piercings, tattoos or plastic surgery&quot;. The Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution in 2013 that calls on its 47 member-states to take numerous actions to promote the physical integrity of children.

Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child enjoins parties to &quot;take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation&quot;. The Committee on the Rights of the Child interprets article 19 as prohibiting corporal punishment, commenting on the &quot;obligation of all States Party to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment.&quot; The United Nations Human Rights Committee has also interpreted Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibiting &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot; to extend to children, including corporal punishment of children.

The Committee on Bioethics of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (1997), citing the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), asserts that &quot;every child should have the opportunity to grow and develop free from preventable illness or injury.&quot;

===Intersex rights===
Intersex children are children born or develop, atypical sexual traits. Historically intersex children have been the subject of involuntary surgical assignment and later hormone replacement therapy to a binary sex/gender, which was often concealed from patients; in the US, this system was known as the optimum gender of rearing model, which organizations such as the ISNA heavily criticized. Intersex children often face high levels of mental stress, and stigmatization, as well as isolation for having atypical bodies, or undergoing medical procedures.

The World Health Organization standard of care for intersex children is to delay all surgery until the child is old enough to participate in informed consent, unless emergency surgery is needed. Intersex people are likewise more likely to develop gender dysphoria then the general population. Organizations such as InterACT and intersex civil society groups exist to support and advocate for intersex youth, and stop involuntary unnecessary medicalization and shame surrounding intersex subjects.

===Other issues===

Other issues affecting children&#x27;s rights include the military use of children, sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

=== Difference between children&#x27;s rights and youth rights ===
In the majority of jurisdictions, for instance, children are not allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to engage in paid employment. Within the youth rights movement, it is believed that the key difference between &quot;children&#x27;s&quot; rights and &quot;youth&quot; rights is that children&#x27;s rights supporters generally advocate the establishment and enforcement of protection for children and youths, while youth rights (a far smaller movement) generally advocates the expansion of freedom for children and/or youths and of rights such as suffrage.

=== Parents&#x27; rights and responsibilities ===
Parents&#x27; rights and Right to family life are connected with Parental responsibilities. Parents are given sufficient powers to fulfill their duties to the child.

Parents affect the lives of children in a unique way, and as such their role in children&#x27;s rights has to be distinguished in a particular way. Particular issues in the child-parent relationship include child neglect, child abuse, freedom of choice, corporal punishment and child custody. There have been theories offered that provide parents with rights-based practices that resolve the tension between &quot;commonsense parenting&quot; and children&#x27;s rights. The issue is particularly relevant in legal proceedings that affect the potential emancipation of minors, and in cases where children sue their parents.

A child&#x27;s rights to a relationship with both their parents is increasingly recognized as an important factor for determining the best interests of the child in divorce and child custody proceedings. Some governments have enacted laws creating a rebuttable presumption that shared parenting is in the best interests of children.

==== Limitations of parental powers ====

Parents do not have absolute power over their children. Parents are subject to criminal laws against abandonment, abuse, and neglect of children. International human rights law provides that manifestation of one&#x27;s religion may be limited in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Courts have placed other limits on parental powers and acts. The Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of &quot;Prince v. Massachusetts&quot;, ruled that a parent&#x27;s religion does not permit a child to be placed at risk. The Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ruled, in the case of &quot;Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority and another&quot;, that parents&#x27; rights diminish with the increasing age and competency of the child, but do not vanish completely until the child reaches majority. Parents&#x27; rights are connected to the parent&#x27;s duties to the child. In the absence of duty, no parents&#x27; rights exists.
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled, in the case of &quot;E (Mrs) v Eve&quot;, that parents may not grant surrogate consent for non-therapeutic sterilization. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled, in the case of &quot;B. (R.) v. Children&#x27;s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto&quot;:

While children undeniably benefit from the Charter, most notably in its protection of their rights to life and to the security of their person, they are unable to assert these rights, and our society accordingly presumes that parents will exercise their freedom of choice in a manner that does not offend the rights of their children.

== Movement ==


The 1796 publication of Thomas Spence&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Infants&quot; is among the earliest English-language assertions of the rights of children. Throughout the 20th century, children&#x27;s rights activists organized for homeless children&#x27;s rights and public education. The 1927 publication of &quot;The Child&#x27;s Right to Respect&quot; by Janusz Korczak strengthened the literature surrounding the field, and today dozens of international organizations are working around the world to promote children&#x27;s rights. In the UK the formation of a community of educationalists, teachers, youth justice workers, politicians and cultural contributors called the New Ideals in Education Conferences (1914–37) stood for the value of &#x27;liberating the child&#x27; and helped to define the &#x27;good&#x27; primary school in England until the 80s. Their conferences inspired the UNESCO organisation, the New Education Fellowship.

A.S. Neill&#x27;s 1915 book &quot;A Dominie&#x27;s Log&quot; (1915), a diary of a headteacher changing his school to one based on the liberation and happiness of the child, can be seen as a cultural product that celebrates the heroes of this movement.

=== Opposition ===

The opposition to children&#x27;s rights long predates any current trend in society, with recorded statements against the rights of children dating to the 13th century and earlier. Opponents to children&#x27;s rights believe that young people need to be protected from the adultcentric world, including the decisions and responsibilities of that world. In a dominantly adult society, childhood is idealized as a time of innocence, a time free of responsibility and conflict, and a time dominated by play. The majority of opposition stems from concerns related to national sovereignty, states&#x27; rights, the parent-child relationship. Financial constraints and the &quot;undercurrent of traditional values in opposition to children&#x27;s rights&quot; are cited, as well. The concept of children&#x27;s rights has received little attention in the United States.

==International human rights law==
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is seen as a basis for all international legal standards for children&#x27;s rights today. There are several conventions and laws that address children&#x27;s rights around the world. A number of current and historical documents affect those rights, including the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, drafted by Eglantyne Jebb in 1923, endorsed by the League of Nations in 1924 and reaffirmed in 1934. A slightly expanded version was adopted by the United Nations in 1946, followed by a much expanded version adopted by the General Assembly in 1959. It later served as the basis for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

===International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights===

The United Nations adopted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in 1966. The ICCPR is a multilateral international covenant that has been ratified or acceded to by nearly all nations on Earth. Nations which have become state-parties to the Covenant are required to honor and enforce the rights enunciated by the Covenant. The treaty came into effect on 23 March 1976. The rights codified by the ICCPR are universal, so they apply to everyone without exception and this includes children. Although children have all rights, some rights such as the right to marry and the right to vote come into effect only after the child reaches maturity.

Some general rights applicable to children include:

* the right to life
* the right to security of person
* the right to freedom from torture
* the right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
* the right to be separated from adults when charged with a crime, the right to speedy adjudication, and the right to be accorded treatment appropriate to their age

Article 24 codifies the right of the child to special protection due to his minority, the right to a name, and the right to a nationality.

===Convention on the Rights of the Child===
The United Nations&#x27; 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC, is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights—civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. National governments that ratify it commit themselves to protecting and ensuring children&#x27;s rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the international community. The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 196 ratifications; the United States is the only country not to have ratified it.

The CRC is based on four core principles: the principle of non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and considering the views of the child in decisions that affect them, according to their age and maturity. The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is said to have significantly increased the profile of children&#x27;s rights worldwide.

===Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action===
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action urges, at Section II para 47, all nations to undertake measures to the maximum extent of their available resources, with the support of international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further, para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, and other forms of sexual abuse. This influenced the adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.

===Enforcement===
A variety of enforcement organizations and mechanisms exist to ensure children&#x27;s rights. They include the Child Rights Caucus for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children. It was set up to promote full implementation and compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to ensure that child rights were given priority during the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children and its Preparatory process. The United Nations Human Rights Council was created &quot;with the hope that it could be more objective, credible and efficient in denouncing human rights violations worldwide than the highly politicized Commission on Human Rights.&quot; The NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a coalition of international non-governmental organizations originally formed in 1983 to facilitate the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==National law==

Many countries around the world have children&#x27;s rights ombudspeople or children&#x27;s commissioners whose official, governmental duty is to represent the interests of the public by investigating and addressing complaints reported by individual citizens regarding children&#x27;s rights. Children&#x27;s ombudspeople can also work for a corporation, a newspaper, an NGO, or even for the general public.

===United States law===
The United States has signed but not ratified the CRC. As a result, children&#x27;s rights have not been systematically implemented in the U.S.

Children are generally afforded the basic rights embodied by the Constitution, as enshrined by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment is to apply to children, born within a marriage or not, but excludes children not yet born. This was reinforced by the landmark US Supreme Court decision of &quot;In re Gault&quot; (1967). In this trial 15-year-old Gerald Gault of Arizona was taken into custody by local police after being accused of making an obscene telephone call. He was detained and committed to the Arizona State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21 for making an obscene phone call to an adult neighbor. In an 8–1 decision, the Court ruled that in hearings which could result in commitment to an institution, people under the age of 18 have the right to notice and counsel, to question witnesses, and to protection against self-incrimination. The Court found that the procedures used in Gault&#x27;s hearing met none of these requirements.

The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969) that students in school have Constitutional rights.

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in the case of &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; that persons may not be executed for crimes committed when below the age of eighteen. It ruled that such executions are cruel and unusual punishment, so they are a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

There are other concerns in the United States regarding children&#x27;s rights. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys is concerned with children&#x27;s rights to a safe, supportive and stable family structure. Their position on children&#x27;s rights in adoption cases states that, &quot;children have a constitutionally based liberty interest in the protection of their established families, rights which are at least equal to, and we believe outweigh, the rights of others who would claim a &#x27;possessory&#x27; interest in these children.&quot; Other issues raised in American children&#x27;s rights advocacy include children&#x27;s rights to inheritance in same-sex marriages and particular rights for youth.

===German law===
A report filed by the President of the INGO Conference of the Council of Europe, Annelise Oeschger finds that children and their parents are subject to United Nations, European Union and UNICEF human rights violations. Of particular concern is the German (and Austrian) agency, Jugendamt (German: Youth office) that often unfairly allows for unchecked government control of the parent-child relationship, which have resulted in harm including torture, degrading, cruel treatment and has led to children&#x27;s death. The problem is complicated by the nearly &quot;unlimited power&quot; of the Jugendamt officers, with no processes to review or resolve inappropriate or harmful treatment. By German law, Jugendamt (JA) officers are protected against prosecution. JA officers span of control is seen in cases that go to family court where experts testimony may be overturned by lesser educated or experienced JA officers; In more than 90% of the cases the JA officer&#x27;s recommendation is accepted by family court. Officers have also disregarded family court decisions, such as when to return children to their parents, without repercussions. Germany has not recognized related child-welfare decisions made by the European Parliamentary Court that have sought to protect or resolve children and parents&#x27; rights violations.

<text>Kim Leith Salmon (born 24 January 1957) is an Australian rock musician and songwriter from Perth. He has worked in various groups including The Scientists, Beasts of Bourbon, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists, Kim Salmon and the Business, and Darling Downs. Australian rock musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described Salmon as one of the first Australians to &quot;embrace wholeheartedly the emergent punk phenomenon of the mid-to-late 1970s&quot; with The Scientists. He declared that Beasts of Bourbon were &quot;masters of uncompromising gutbucket blues and hard-edged rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. In 2004 Salmon was inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Association Hall of Fame and in 2007, into the Music Victoria Awards Hall of Fame.

==Early work==

Kim Leith Salmon was born in 1957 in the Western Australian port city of Bunbury. He later recalled wanting to be a nuclear physicist until, at the age of 13, he heard &quot;heavy rock stuff&quot; on the radio. He bought his first guitar, &quot;an acoustic steel string thing&quot;, for A$14 and taught himself to play &quot;Black Night&quot; and &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. By the age of 18 Salmon had started a fine arts course at a university but deferred after a year, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really fit in with it&quot;. At the age of 19 he was a member of Troubled Waters, a cabaret covers band playing in a Fremantle strip club.

In August 1976 with Salmon on lead vocals and lead guitar, he formed Perth&#x27;s first punk band, The Cheap Nasties. His early influences include The Modern Lovers&#x27; self-titled album (1976), New York Dolls, and The Stooges. Salmon recruited his high school mates: Mark Betts on drums; Dan Dare on bass guitar; Neil Fernandez on guitar; and Robert Porritt on vocals. After Salmon left in December 1977 they were renamed The Manikins.

By early 1978 Salmon had joined The Exterminators replacing Mark Demetrius on lead vocals. Fellow members were John Dowlings on drums; Roddy Radalj on guitar and vocals; and Boris Sujdovic on bass guitar. The group were renamed The Invaders, and in May 1978 James Baker replaced Dowlings on drums (ex-Geeks, Beheaded, The Victims). They changed their name to The Scientists and in August Sujdovic left. He was eventually replaced by Dennis Byrne on bass guitar in January 1979.

The line up of Salmon, Baker, Byrne and Radalj recorded their debut single, &quot;Frantic Romantic&quot;, which appeared in June that year. It was co-written by Salmon and Baker. However Byrne and Radalj had already left in April and were replaced by Ian Sharples on bass guitar and Ben Juniper on guitar. In December 1979 and in February and March 1980, as a member of The Scientists, Salmon toured the eastern states of Australia and they appeared on TV pop music series, &quot;Countdown&quot;.

They had issued their debut extended play, &quot;The Scientists&quot;, in February: Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the single and EP as &quot;one of the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk rock era&quot;. Further line up changes occurred with Salmon, Baker and Sharples recording a studio album of the same name in January 1981. The group broke up and Salmon formed a briefly existing group, Louie Louie, with Brett Rixon on drums (ex-Screaming Fits), and Kim Williams on bass guitar. By August that year Louie Louie had disbanded and &quot;The Scientists&quot; album was released by EMI. McFarlane felt that Salmon was one of the first Australians to &quot;embrace wholeheartedly the emergent punk phenomenon of the mid-to-late 1970s&quot;.

==The Scientists in Sydney and United Kingdom==

In September 1981 Salmon and Sujdovic, with Rixon on drums and Tony Thewlis (ex-Helicopters) on guitar, reformed The Scientists and moved to Sydney. McFarlane noted that the Sydney line up had &quot;dropped the melodic, punky power pop of old for a more malevolent, psychedelic-tinged neo-rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. By December 1982 they had issued another single, &quot;This Is My Happy Hour&quot;. In September the following year they released another EP, &quot;Blood Red River&quot;, which was an influential record of the post-punk era. In March 1984 the group toured the United Kingdom and Europe playing an of blues, punk and noise. The Scientists remained in the UK and went through several further incarnations, with Salmon remaining as the sole constant member, before the band returned to Australia in early 1987 and broke up again late that year.

Salmon&#x27;s work with The Scientists in the 1980s influenced grunge music, which rose to prominence around Seattle, United States, before impacting on popular music in the early 1990s. The Scientists relied on unorthodox bass-heavy rhythms and distorted guitars, the latter being a direct precursor to grunge. The term grunge was used by Salmon in the mid-1980s to describe The Scientists&#x27; sound, which he recalled for the audience in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary series on Australian music, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot;, Episode 6: &quot;Gathering of the Tribes 1984-2000&quot; on 12 September 2001. Everett True writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 disputed that Seattle was the origin of the genre, &quot;[t]here&#x27;s more of an argument to be had for grunge beginning in Australia with the Scientists and their scrawny punk ilk&quot;.

==The Surrealists and Beasts of Bourbon==
In August 1983 while still a member of The Scientists, Salmon on guitar joined Beasts of Bourbon as a side project alongside old band mates Baker and Sudjovic; with Spencer P. Jones on guitar (of The Johnnys); and Tex Perkins on vocals (ex-Tex Deadly and the Dum-Dums). In October that year they recorded the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Axeman&#x27;s Jazz&quot; (July 1984). In February 1984 Salmon and Perkins formed Salamander Jim with Richard Ploog on drums (also in The Church), however by the following month Salmon had returned to his commitments with The Scientists.

During The Scientists 1987 tour of Australia Salmon formed Kim Salmon and the Surrealists in Perth as an indie pop group. Fellow founders were Brian Henry Hooper on bass guitar and Tony Pola on drums. Their first two albums, &quot;Hit Me with the Surreal Feel&quot; (October 1988) and &quot;Just Because You Can&#x27;t See It ... Doesn&#x27;t Mean It Isn&#x27;t There&quot; (February 1990), were described by McFarlane as having a &quot;dark, confrontational sound powered by Salmon&#x27;s scratchy, neurotic guitar and snarling vocals&quot;. Also in 1990 Salmon issued his debut solo single, &quot;Lightning Scary&quot;, which appeared on the Surrealists third album, &quot;Essence&quot;, in September of the following year.

From March 1988 Beasts of Bourbon reconvened and Salmon spent time with both groups over the subsequent five years. By February 1991 Hooper and Pola had replaced Sudjovic and Baker respectively as members of Beasts of Bourbon. In 1993 after touring Australia and Europe with Beasts of Bourbon Salmon, Hooper and Pola left the group to concentrate on the Surrealists. McFarlane declared Beasts of Bourborn were &quot;masters of uncompromising gutbucket blues and hard-edged rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;.

In July 1994 Salmon issued an album, &quot;Hey Believer&quot;, with backing band STM (Sexually Transmitted Music) featuring Warren Ellis on violin and Jim White on drums (both future Dirty Three members), and Andrew Entsch on double bass. Also that year Salmon released a solo live cassette album, &quot;Hookline and Singer&quot;, available at his gigs.

The Surrealists line up changed as members left - Greg Bainbridge joined on drums in 1994 and Stu Thomas joined on bass in 1995. Micheal Redman and Leon De Bruin were the brass section for The Surrealists in 1998-9. Later, Phil Collings took on The Surrealists drum duties, and is the current drummer as at 2020.

==Antenna, and then The Business==
Early in 1998 Salmon on lead vocals and guitar formed Antenna in Sydney as a collaboration with Dave Faulkner on lead vocals and guitar (ex-The Victims, The Manikins, Hoodoo Gurus); Justin Frew on guitar and Stuart McCarthy on guitar (both from Southend). In November that year Antenna issued their debut album, &quot;Installation&quot;, and single, &quot;Come on Spring&quot;. According to McFarlane, the single had an &quot;electronic undertow balanced by an irresistible melody&quot;; while the album was an &quot;eclectic, diverse and challenging mix of electronica, breezy pop, throbbing bass, washes of guitar and keyboards, and dance floor grooves&quot;. Antenna performed on the Big Day Out tour early in 1999 and then disbanded.

Salmon&#x27;s next band, Kim Salmon and the Business, formed in mid-1999 with Stu Thomas on bass guitar, Greg Bainbridge on drums, Leon de Bruin on trumpet, and Michael Redman on saxophone and flute – all were latter day members of the Surrealists. Other subsequent members were Ben Grant on sax, Damian Maughan on trumpet, Tarek Smallman on drums and sampler, Paul Williamson on trumpet, Rob Jackson on sax, and Phil Collings on drums. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Record&quot;, was released on 25 October 1999. McFarlane felt it is &quot;one of Salmon&#x27;s strongest to date, full of diverse and soulful pop&quot;. It was Feature Album of the Week on Triple J.

The lead single, &quot;Saving Me from Me&quot;, appeared ahead of the album on 20 September 1999. Other tracks on the single are &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Lament&quot;, and a cover of Dudley Moore&#x27;s &quot;Love Me&quot;, from the feature film, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967). Late in 1999 the Business toured Australia promoting the album and debut single. A second single, &quot;Disconnected&quot;, released on 13 March 2000 included two remixes by Mr Chill, Gary B and Justin Frew. The group toured to promote that single.

==Darling Downs and SALMON==
Some of Kim Salmon&#x27;s later work has reflected a quieter style. In 2002 he released an acoustic solo album, &quot;E(a)rnest&quot;, where he used a Yamaha G55 and spent 18 months recording it in his own studio. He then commenced a country music group, Darling Downs, with former Died Pretty singer, Ron Peno. Their debut album, &quot;How Can I Forget This Heart of Mine?&quot;, was released in 2005. It appeared in the US market in May 2006 and Dan Raper of PopMatters noted &quot;these are subtle, slow-hitting songs. They&#x27;re not insignificant, but they are certainly quirky&quot; although the album &quot;could reward you, but not right away, and it&#x27;s riddled with tics and mannerisms that are almost purposefully thrown in to turn you away&quot;.

In June 2004 Salmon was inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Association&#x27;s newly established Hall of Fame. Salmon had been enrolled onto the WAM Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll of Renown in 1994. Darling Downs&#x27; second album, &quot;From one to Another&quot;, appeared on 15 October 2007, which Michael Berick of Allmusic found was &quot;mining a spare, simple acoustic Americana sound that basically consists of Peno&#x27;s rural twang and Salmon&#x27;s picking on a banjo or guitar&quot;.

In September 2004 Kim Salmon formed an instrumental group consisting of two drummers and six guitarists, SALMON. The band included Clare Moore and Michael Stranges on drums; and Dave Graney, Ash Naylor, Penny Ikinger, Matt Walker and Anton Ruddick on guitar. Kim Salmon played guitar and a sampler. Stu Thomas later replaced Naylor for live shows and a for TV performance on ABCTV&#x27;s &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; show. The band released an album, &quot;Rock Formations&quot;, in May 2007 on both CD and as a limited double LP – only 500 copies were pressed. The first half of the album is made up of tracks recorded at rehearsal and the second half recorded live at the Metro in Sydney. I-94 Bar&#x27;s reviewer T J Honeysuckle was impressed by &quot;a crack team of Melbourne based musicians kicking it out, letting it out of their systems, with an air of abandonment and glee permeating each and every track&quot;. Fellow reviewer at the website Patrick Emery felt it was &quot;a grab bag of neo-70s riffs, screeching vocals (albeit computer generated) and iconic rock theatrics&quot;.

==Reformations and other works==

In August 2011 Kim Salmon wrote an article, &quot;Spare a Dollar for the Maker, Music Doesn&#x27;t Play Itself&quot;, for &quot;The Age&quot;, to raise awareness of the financial problems of local musicians with live venues closing and being underpaid. In July 2013 Dan Cass of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Salmon providing guitar tuition, &quot;[h]e shows me licks, and explains the basics of musical theory&quot;.

In September 2013 Salmon recalled &quot;a whole lot of what I do is tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. This is great, but I still like to make new stuff. I&#x27;ve kept my sanity over the years by doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived&quot;. He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, which was issued as a live album, &quot;Sedition&quot; in the following year.

In 2010 The Surrealists line up of Salmon, Stu Thomas and Phil Collings on drums, released a studio album, &quot;Grand Unifying Theory&quot;. Ned Raggett of Allmusic found &quot;it&#x27;s more focused on the sharply brawling side of his work than some of the quieter recent efforts, this is still an album that showcases tense moments and arrangements throughout&quot;.

In 2012 he teamed with Spencer P Jones (both ex-Beasts of Bourbon) which resulted in &quot;The Runaways&quot; (February 2013). Darling Downs&#x27; third album, &quot;In the Days When the World Was Wide&quot;, appeared in July 2013. Aaron Curran for Mess+Noise noted that it &quot;harkens back to the lost opportunities of youth, but in a fond and measured way filled with peaceful resignation rather than caustic regret&quot;. It was followed by a reformation of Beasts of Bourbon which recorded a live album, &quot;30 Years on Borrowed Time&quot; (August 2013).

==Personal life==
Kim Salmon co-wrote &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot; (1982), &quot;Blood Red River&quot; (1983) and &quot;Murderess In A Purple Dress&quot; with his then-girlfriend, Linda Fearon. Salmon and Fearon later married. By 1991 the couple had two sons, Alex and Jack (born 1 November 1990, Sydney). Salmon wrote &quot;Desensitised&quot; on The Surrealists album, &quot;Sin Factory&quot; (May 1993), about his younger son, Jack. Salmon, Fearon and Brett Woodward formed Bloody Stupid Productions which provided a music video for &quot;Lightning Scary&quot;. The couple were separated by 1994. Fearon had provided the cover photography for &quot;Hey Believer&quot; (July 1994) by Kim Salmon with STM.

By August 2005 Salmon was married again and had two more children, another son and a daughter.

A biography of his life was released in 2019, called &quot;Nine Parts Water, One Part Sand: Kim Salmon and the Formula For Grunge&quot;.

==Television Performances==
On 16 July 1997 Kim performed on the RMITV show Under Melbourne Tonight.

<text>The Queen Elizabeth Islands () are the northernmost cluster of islands in Canada&#x27;s Arctic Archipelago, split between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories in Northern Canada. The Queen Elizabeth Islands contain approximately 14% of the global glacier and ice cap area (excluding the inland and shelf ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica). The southern islands are called the Parry Islands or Parry Archipelago.

==Geography==
The islands, together in area, were renamed as a group after Elizabeth II on her coronation as Queen of Canada in 1953. The islands cover an area approximately the shape of a right triangle, bounded by the Nares Strait on the east, Parry Channel on the south and the Arctic Ocean to the north and west. Most are uninhabited although the Natural Resources Canada&#x27;s Climate Change Geoscience Program Earth Sciences Sector (ESS), has monitors on the islands. In 1969 Panarctic Oils, now part of Suncor Energy, began operating exploration oil wells in the Franklinian and Sverdrup basins and planned on establishing its resource base in the Queen Elizabeth Islands. It ceased production in the 1970s. At the 2013 GeoConvention the Arctic Islands region were called Canada&#x27;s perpetual &quot;last petroleum exploration frontier&quot;. Hogg and Enachescu argued that the development and implementation of advanced marine and land seismic technologies in Alaska, Northern Europe and Siberia could be modified for use in the Queen Elizabeth Islands.

Queen Elizabeth Islands had not been fully charted until the British Northwest Passage expeditions and later Norwegian exploration of the 19th century.

These islands were known as the &quot;Parry Archipelago&quot; for over 130 years. They were first named after British Arctic explorer Sir William Parry, who sailed there in 1820, aboard the &quot;Hecla&quot;. Since the renaming of the archipelago in 1953, the term &quot;Parry Islands&quot; continued to be used for its southwestern part (less Ellesmere Island and the Sverdrup Islands). The regional break down of the archipelago is therefore as follows:
*Ellesmere Island
*Sverdrup Islands
*Parry Islands

Ellesmere Island is the northernmost and by far the largest. The Sverdrup Islands are located west of Ellesmere Island and north of Norwegian Bay. The remaining islands further south and west, but north of the Parry Channel (Lancaster Sound, Viscount Melville Sound and M&#x27;Clure Strait), have been carrying the name Parry Islands, which name until 1953 had also included the Sverdrup Islands and Ellesmere Island. South of the Parry Channel are the remaining islands of the Arctic Archipelago.

The islands lay on top of and were formed by the movement of the Queen Elizabeth Islands Subplate.

===Major islands===
Many of the islands are among the largest in the world, the largest being Ellesmere Island. Other major islands include Amund Ringnes Island, Axel Heiberg Island, Bathurst Island, Borden Island, Cornwall Island, Cornwallis Island, Devon Island, Eglinton Island, Ellef Ringnes Island, Mackenzie King Island, Melville Island, and Prince Patrick Island.

===Smaller islands===
Other smaller but notable islands include; Beechey Island (), which held the graves of Petty Officer John Torrington, Royal Marine Private William Braine, and Able Seaman John Hartnell, three members of Sir John Franklin&#x27;s crew who took part in his lost expedition, Hans Island (), a small, uninhabited barren knoll measuring whose ownership is disputed by Canada and Denmark, the Cheyne Islands (), three small ( together) islands that are Important Bird Area (#NU049) and a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site (NU site 5) and Skraeling Island () an important archaeological site where Inuit (along with their ancestors the Dorset and Thule) and Norse artifacts have been found. They consist of Silurian and Carboniferous rocks covered with tundra.

===Population===
With a population of less than 400, the islands are nearly uninhabited. There are only three permanently inhabited places in the islands. The two municipalities are the hamlets of Resolute (population 198 as of the 2016 census), on Cornwallis Island, and Grise Fiord (population 129 as of the 2016 census), on Ellesmere Island. Alert is a weather station staffed by Environment and Climate Change Canada, a Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) atmosphere monitoring laboratory on Ellesmere Island, and has several temporary inhabitants due to the co-located CFS Alert. Eureka, a small research base on Ellesmere Island, has a population of zero but at least eight staff on a continuous rotational basis.



Formerly staffed stations were Mould Bay on Prince Patrick Island, Isachsen on Ellef Ringnes Island, and Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island.

Abandoned settlements are Dundas Harbour on Devon Island and Craig Harbour on Ellesmere Island.

== Administration ==
Until 1999, the Queen Elizabeth Islands were part of the Baffin Region of the Northwest Territories.

With the creation of Nunavut in 1999 all islands and fractions of islands of the archipelago east of the 110th meridian west became part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the new territory, which was the major portion of the archipelago. The rest remained with the now-reduced Northwest Territories. Borden Island, Mackenzie King Island and Melville Island were divided between the two territories.

Prince Patrick Island, Eglinton Island and Emerald Island are the only notable islands that are now completely part of the Northwest Territories.

Below the level of the territory, there is the municipal level of administration. On that level, there are only two municipalities, Resolute and Grise Fiord, with an aggregate area of (0.11 percent of the area of the Queen Elizabeth Islands), but with most of the population of the archipelago (327 in 2021). The remaining 99.89 percent are unincorporated area, with a census 2021 population of zero, albeit a fluctuating population centred in Alert and Eureka, Nunavut.

== Overview of the islands ==
According to the Atlas of Canada there are 34 larger and 2,092 smaller islands in the archipelago. With the exception of Ellesmere Island, they fall into two groups, the Sverdrup Islands and the Parry Islands:

== Glaciers and ice caps ==

In 2000 it was estimated that the Queen Elizabeth Islands were covered by about glaciers that represent c.14% of all glaciers and ice caps in the world. According to a 2011 report, the surface mass balance of four, the Devon Ice Cap measured (northwest sector only); the Meighen Ice Cap measured ; the Melville South Ice Cap measured and the White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island glacier was . The size of these glaciers has been measured since 1961 and their results published in such distinguished journals as the International Glaciological Society&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Glaciology&quot;.

Of the four ice caps that the federal government&#x27;s NRCan&#x27;s Climate Change Geoscience Program Earth Sciences Sector (ESS), monitors onsite in the Canadian High Arctic, three are in the Queen Elizabeth Islands: Devon, Meighen and Melville. A 2013 Natural Resources Canada memo says that shrinking of the ice caps started in the late 1980s, and has accelerated rapidly since 2005. The increased melt rate was confirmed by University of California, Irvine in 2017.

Computer analysis of a glacier inventory of Axel Heiberg Island was undertaken in the 1960s. Later inventories of the World Glacier Monitoring Service under the direction of Fritz Müller, who worked on glacier inventories internationally, included the Axel Heiberg Island glacier.

Other glaciers and ice caps in the Queen Elizabeth Islands include the Agassiz Ice Cap, Benedict Glacier, Disraeli Glacier, Eugenie Glacier, Gull Glacier, Parrish Glacier, Sven Hedin Glacier and the Turnabout Glacier.

<text>ORP &quot;Fala&quot; is a Polish patrol craft of the Project 912 class (NATO: &quot;Obluze&quot; Class). She was the first ship of a five-ship series, commissioned in 1965. Of a Polish design, they were built in Gdynia. &quot;Fala&quot; means &#x27;the wave&#x27;.

She initially wore a number: &quot;OP-301&quot;, then: &quot;321&quot;. Initially she served in the Border Brigade of the Polish Navy, then in 1991 she, along with the other four ships, was given to the Polish Border Guard (receiving a new livery).

After decommissioning in 1996, &quot;Fala&quot; was opened as a museum ship in Kolobrzeg, as part of the Muzeum Oręża Polskiego exhibition.

<doc id="701837" wikidata="Q938957" url="?curid=701837" title="Esophagogastroduodenoscopy">
<text>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), also called by various other names, is a diagnostic endoscopic procedure that visualizes the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract down to the duodenum. It is considered a minimally invasive procedure since it does not require an incision into one of the major body cavities and does not require any significant recovery after the procedure (unless sedation or anesthesia has been used). However, a sore throat is common.

== Alternative names ==
The words &quot;esophagogastroduodenoscopy&quot; (EGD; American English) and &quot;oesophagogastroduodenoscopy&quot; (OGD; British English; see spelling differences) are pronounced . It is also called &quot;panendoscopy&quot; (PES) and &quot;upper GI endoscopy&quot;. It is also often called just &quot;upper endoscopy&quot;, &quot;upper GI&quot;, or even just &quot;endoscopy&quot;; because EGD is the most commonly performed type of endoscopy, the ambiguous term &quot;endoscopy&quot; is sometimes informally used to refer to EGD by default. The term &quot;gastroscopy&quot; literally focuses on the stomach alone, but in practice, the usage overlaps.

== Medical uses ==
=== Diagnostic ===
* Unexplained anemia (usually along with a colonoscopy)
* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding as evidenced by hematemesis or melena
* Persistent dyspepsia in patients over the age of 45 years
* Heartburn and chronic acid reflux – this can lead to a precancerous lesion called Barrett&#x27;s esophagus
* Persistent emesis – vomiting 
* Dysphagia – difficulty in swallowing
* Odynophagia – painful swallowing
* Persistent nausea
* IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases)

=== Surveillance ===
* Surveillance of Barrett&#x27;s esophagus
* Surveillance of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer
* Occasionally after gastric surgery

=== Confirmation of diagnosis/biopsy ===
* Abnormal barium swallow or barium meal
* Confirmation of celiac disease (via biopsy)

=== Therapeutic ===
* Treatment (banding/sclerotherapy) of esophageal varices
* Injection therapy (e.g., epinephrine in bleeding lesions)
* Cutting off of larger pieces of tissue with a snare device (e.g., polyps, endoscopic mucosal resection)
* Application of cautery to tissues
* Removal of foreign bodies (e.g., food) that have been ingested
* Tamponade of bleeding esophageal varices with a balloon
* Application of photodynamic therapy for treatment of esophageal malignancies
* Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst
* Tightening the lower esophageal sphincter
* Dilating or stenting of stenosis or achalasia
* Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (feeding tube placement)
* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combines EGD with fluoroscopy
* Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines EGD with 5–12 MHz ultrasound imaging

=== Newer interventions ===
* Endoscopic trans-gastric laparoscopy
* Placement of gastric balloons in bariatric surgery

== Complications ==
The complication rate is about 1 in 1000. They include:
* aspiration, causing aspiration pneumonia
* bleeding
* perforation
* cardiopulmonary problems
When used in infants, the esophagogastroduodenoscope may compress the trachealis muscle, which narrows the trachea. This can result in reduced airflow to the lungs. Infants may be intubated to make sure that the trachea is fixed open.

== Limitations ==
Problems of gastrointestinal &quot;function&quot; are usually not well diagnosed by endoscopy since &quot;motion&quot; or &quot;secretion&quot; of the gastrointestinal tract is not easily inspected by EGD. Nonetheless, findings such as excess fluid or poor motion of the gut during endoscopy can be suggestive of disorders of function. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia are not diagnosed with EGD, but EGD may be helpful in excluding other diseases that mimic these common disorders.

== Procedure ==
The tip of the endoscope should be lubricated and checked for critical functions including tip angulations, air and water suction, and image quality.

The patient is kept NPO (nil per os) or NBM (nothing by mouth) for at least 4 hours before the procedure. Most patients tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.

The patient lies on their left side with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the endoscope. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine the first and second parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a &#x27;J&#x27; shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.

In its most basic use, the endoscope is used to inspect the internal anatomy of the digestive tract. Often inspection alone is sufficient, but biopsy is a valuable adjunct to endoscopy. Small biopsies can be made with a pincer (biopsy forceps) which is passed through the scope and allows sampling of 1 to 3 mm pieces of tissue under direct vision. The intestinal mucosa heals quickly from such biopsies.

Clinical practice varies with respect to routine biopsy for histological analysis of the examined upper gastrointestinal system. A rapid urease test is quick, easy, and cost-effective screening for Helicobacter pylori infection.

=== Equipment ===

* Endoscope
** Non-coaxial optic fiber system to carry light to the tip of the endoscope
** A chip camera at the tip of the endoscope – this has now replaced the coaxial optic fibers of older scopes that were prone to damage and consequent loss of picture quality
** Air/water channel to clean the lens using the water and air channel for drying the lens itself and to insufflate the esophagus and the stomach during the operation to prevent from collapsing the track to better vision in the procedure
** Suction/Working channels – these may be in the form of one or more channels
** Control handle – this houses the controls
** Umbilical Cords that connect to the light source and video processor to supply the endoscope with suction and air pressure and water for (suction and irrigation process) and light to transmit in the body to deliver the video signal to the processor to show the live image on the monitor
* Stack
** Light source
** Suction
** Electrosurgical unit
** Video recorder/photo printer
* Instruments
** Biopsy forceps
** Snares
** Injecting needles
* Chemical agents
** Dimethicone
** Acetate
** Indigo carmine

<doc id="701844" wikidata="Q373415" url="?curid=701844" title="Nigel Winterburn">
<text>Nigel Winterburn (born 11 December 1963) is an English former professional footballer who made 687 appearances in the Football League and Premier League. He was capped twice by England, in 1989 and 1993.

Winterburn played primarily as a left back from 1981 to 2003. He is best known for his role alongside Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon, forming the defensive line for Arsenal in the Premier League and European football during the 1990s. He also played for Wimbledon and West Ham United, and was contracted to Birmingham City and Oxford United.

After his playing career ended, he went into media work. He was briefly a part of the coaching staff at Blackburn Rovers.

==Playing career==

===Birmingham City===
Winterburn was born in Arley, Warwickshire. He became an apprentice at Birmingham City in May 1980 before turning professional in 1981 after he had played for Nuneaton schoolboys. While at Birmingham City, Winterburn won an England Youth Cap but failed to make the Birmingham first team. After an unsuccessful trial at Oxford United, he was signed by Dave Bassett to join Wimbledon on a free transfer in August 1983.

===Wimbledon===
Winterburn contributed to Wimbledon&#x27;s promotion from Division Three to Division Two in 1983–84, and from Division Two to Division One two years later. Winterburn was voted Wimbledon&#x27;s Player of the Year in each of his four seasons with the club. He missed only 7 out of 172 league games, was ever-present in 1986–87 when Wimbledon finished sixth in the First Division, and was capped by the England under-21 team. In May 1987 he was transferred for £350,000 to Arsenal, whose manager, George Graham, was seeking a long-term replacement for Kenny Sansom.

===Arsenal===
Winterburn began his Arsenal career at right-back, an emergency measure employed by Graham after he had been unsuccessful in finding a replacement for Viv Anderson. Winterburn made his Arsenal league debut as a substitute at Highbury against Southampton on 21 November 1987, playing in 17 league games that season.

Though primarily left-footed, Winterburn settled into the right-back role and became quickly involved in two controversial incidents in his first season. First, he was seen to openly goad Brian McClair after the Manchester United striker had missed a late penalty in an FA Cup tie on 20 February 1988 at Highbury. The second incident came in the League Cup final later that same season. Despite having fallen behind in the early stages, Arsenal, the holders, were leading Luton Town 2–1 at Wembley with less than quarter of an hour to go when Arsenal were awarded a penalty after David Rocastle was fouled. Michael Thomas had been Arsenal&#x27;s designated penalty taker all season but after spot-kick failures from Thomas and two subsequent successors, it was Winterburn – who had never taken a penalty for Arsenal before – who stepped up to take the kick. He struck powerfully towards to the bottom right-hand corner as he viewed it, but Luton goalkeeper Andy Dibble guessed correctly and pushed the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton then scored twice in the final ten minutes and won the final 3–2.

Sansom, demoted to reserve team football, left Arsenal for Newcastle United in December 1988 and Winterburn settled into his more familiar left back role as a result, staying in it for more than a decade. He and fellow full back Lee Dixon flanked two superb central defenders in captain Tony Adams and veteran David O&#x27;Leary, joined during the 1989 season by Steve Bould. Often the manager would play all five of them as Arsenal took holders Liverpool to a last-game showdown at Anfield for the First Division title, which would have been Arsenal&#x27;s first title since the Double year of 1971. Arsenal&#x27;s situation meant they needed to win by at least two clear goals to clinch the championship. Winterburn&#x27;s free kick set up a first for Alan Smith shortly after half-time, but the second looked as though it would elude them until Thomas scored in injury time. This victory was the culmination of the film Fever Pitch.

In the penultimate game, a 2–2 draw at home to Wimbledon on 17 May 1989, Winterburn scored what some consider the finest goal of his career, driving the ball diagonally into the far, top corner from 25 yards with his little-used right foot. Given both points and goal difference were identical (Arsenal winning the league on more goals scored), every single goal Arsenal scored that campaign eventually proved decisive in winning the league, but had Arsenal lost that day, then the Anfield game would have been irrelevant as the title would have already been lost.

Winterburn made his England debut later the same year, 15 November 1989, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw against Italy. Though many media outlets and Winterburn&#x27;s own club manager regularly extolled his virtues as an England left back, the national coach, Bobby Robson, had him as no higher than third in the pecking order. Stuart Pearce was going to the 1990 World Cup as first choice, with Tony Dorigo as back-up. Only injury to either would see a way open for Winterburn, and that did not happen; however, he did earn appearances for the B team.

Arsenal earned no trophies in 1990, but went on to win the league title again the next year with one loss. During a 1–0 victory away at Manchester United, there was a mass brawl that was started by a Winterburn tackle on Denis Irwin. Winterburn was eventually booked, and subsequently fined two weeks wages (along with 3 teammates and the manager, George Graham). Despite the two-point deduction – one more than Manchester United as Arsenal had been involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989 – Arsenal went on to win the league comfortably.

Two years later, Winterburn was in the Arsenal team which won both cup competitions and thus completed his domestic set of medals. Arsenal defeated Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 in both the League Cup and FA Cup finals, the latter in a replay.

Winterburn&#x27;s form earned him a brief England recall by Graham Taylor, who included him in a squad for a mini-tournament in the U.S. during which England lost 2–0 to the United States national team. Winterburn came on as a sub for Manchester United winger Lee Sharpe in the final match of the contest against Germany. This was the last time he played for England.

In 1994, Arsenal beat Italian side Parma 1–0, to win the European Cup Winners Cup, Arsenal&#x27;s first success continentally for a quarter of a century. They would not be so successful the following year as they reached the final again but were beaten 2–1 by Real Zaragoza.

Arsène Wenger arrived at Arsenal at the end of 1996, bringing a new focus on self-awareness and dietary habits into the Arsenal squad. This allowed the ageing defence (Adams was the youngest at 30 years of age; Martin Keown had also arrived to account for O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s retirement after the 1993 FA Cup success) to thrive in and prolong the latter years of their careers. Arsenal won the &quot;double&quot; of Premiership and FA Cup in 1998. During the league campaign in September 1997, as against Wimbledon in 1989, Winterburn once again scored a vital goal, driving the ball from over 25 yards diagonally into the far, top corner, this time with his favoured left foot. The 89th-minute winner, in a 3-2 Arsenal victory against Chelsea away at Stamford Bridge, moved Arsenal up to 2nd in the table. Winterburn was called up by caretaker manager Howard Wilkinson for the England squad in a friendly against France in 1999 but he was the odd one out from Wilkinson&#x27;s first XI – Seaman, Adams, Keown and Dixon all started but Winterburn lost out to Graeme Le Saux for the left-back slot and stayed on the bench for the 2–0 defeat.

In 1999–2000, Arsenal again failed to progress beyond the group stages of the Champions League, and therefore entered the UEFA Cup at the third round, where they were drawn against Nantes. During the first leg, which Arsenal won 3–0, Winterburn again scored with a drive into the far, top corner, though this time only from just outside the box. Arsenal went on to reach the UEFA Cup final but Winterburn had been forced out of the team by the Brazilian Sylvinho, although he in turn was displaced by the fledgling Ashley Cole within another 12 months.

===West Ham United===
Winterburn joined West Ham United in June 2000 for a fee of £250,000 after making 429 league appearances and scoring eight goals for Arsenal. He played 94 games in all competitions for West Ham, scoring one goal in a 1–0 away win against Leeds United on 18 November 2000. He retired in 2003, with his last game played on 2 February 2003 against Liverpool.

==International career==
Winterburn made his full debut for England on 15 November 1989 against Italy. He made his second and final appearance for the senior national side nearly four years later on 19 June 1993 against Germany. The regular England left back at this stage was Stuart Pearce.

==Coaching career==
On 14 July 2008, Winterburn joined Paul Ince&#x27;s backroom staff at Blackburn Rovers as defensive coach. Following Ince&#x27;s dismissal in December 2008, Winterburn was deemed surplus to requirements at Ewood Park. New manager Sam Allardyce stated, &quot;I spoke to Nigel Winterburn today to say that, from my point of view, in terms of specialist defensive coaching, I think I can look after that area myself now.&quot;

==Media career==
In 2013, Winterburn became a pundit for BT Sport at the start of their football coverage. He regularly appears on the programme BT Sport Score.

<doc id="701849" wikidata="Q47677" url="?curid=701849" title="Chen Boda">
<text>Chen Boda (; 29 July 1904 – 20 September 1989), was a Chinese Communist journalist, professor and political theorist who rose to power as the chief interpreter of Maoism (or &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot;) in the first 20 years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Chen became a close associate of Mao Zedong in Yan&#x27;an, during the late 1930s, drafting speeches and theoretical essays and directing propaganda.

After 1949, Chen played a leading role in overseeing mass media and ideology; at the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Mao named him Chairman of the Cultural Revolution Group, entrusting him with the task of guiding the new mass movement. However, his ultra-radical line and close ties with Lin Biao eventually led to his downfall in 1970.

==Early life==
Chen Boda was born Chen Jianxiang () in 1904 to peasant parents. His courtesy name was Shangyou (). During his childhood, his family moved to Jimei, in modern-day Amoy, likely to facilitate young Chen&#x27;s enrollment at the Jimei Normal School, from which Chen graduated as a schoolteacher (he taught at various elementary schools until 1927).

In 1925, Chen enrolled at Shanghai Labor University, studying literature, and in 1927 he joined the Chinese Communist Party. After returning to Fujian, he was hired as the personal secretary of General Zhang Zhen, helping to prepare for the 1926–1927 Northern Expedition from the CCP side of the First United Front. When the Front collapsed, Chen fled and was eventually arrested in Nanjing. He was released after a month on General Zhang&#x27;s recommendation. Shortly thereafter, Chen was sent by the Party to Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied politics and Marxist philosophy for four years.

In 1931, Chen Boda returned to China, and married Sichuan native Zhu Yuren, who had also studied in Moscow. Chen became a professor of politics and ancient Chinese history at China College in Beijing while writing articles under the pen names Chen Zhimei and Chen Boda. Most of these articles focused on the dispute between advocates of &quot;national defense literature&quot; such as Lu Xun, and more nationalist authors. Chen also did underground work for the Party in Tianjin.

From 1937 on, he taught politics and Marxist philosophy at the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan&#x27;an, where he became a leader in the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement. He soon became personal research assistant and chief political aide to Mao Zedong. Chen published the first collection of Mao&#x27;s writings in 1937, and an official history of the Party in 1945.

==Role in the post–1949 government==
After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Mao entrusted Chen with many important tasks. Chen Boda became:

* Deputy Director of the CCP Propaganda Department, overseeing the People&#x27;s Daily and the Xinhua News Agency 
* Director of the Institute of Political Research
* Editor-in-chief of the CCP theoretical organ &quot;Red Flag&quot;, when it was established in 1958 
* Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, overseeing Social and Political Sciences (these departments later branched out to form the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)

In 1951, Chen wrote an article with the title &quot;Mao Zedong&#x27;s theory of the Chinese Revolution is the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution&quot; and a book entitled &quot;Mao Zedong on the Chinese Revolution&quot;. These works made him one of the most important interpreters of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the 1950s he became one of Mao&#x27;s closest associates, compiling many of the quotations eventually published in the Red Book.

In 1950 Chen accompanied Mao to Moscow to participate in the negotiations with Joseph Stalin that led to the signing of the 30-year treaty of alliance (February 1950) between China and the Soviet Union.

Following Mao&#x27;s complaint that &quot;the economic sector is blocking me and Comrade Liu,&quot; Chen was appointed in 1962 to serve as a vice director of the State Planning Commission.

===Cultural Revolution===

From 1966 until 1969, Chen Boda was to play an important role in the Cultural Revolution. In May 1966, he was placed at the head of the newly formed Cultural Revolution Group (CRG), a body established to oversee and direct the course of the Cultural Revolution. In time, this group would rise to become the most important political body in China, surpassing even the influence of the Politburo. Furthermore, Chen Boda was also placed as head of the Communist government&#x27;s propaganda apparatus alongside Jiang Qing when the previous leader, Lu Dingyi (with whom he had often quarrelled), was deposed in 1966. He also became a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo.

According to the Central Committee leadership, the Cultural Revolution Group began to show signs of ultra-leftism during the late 1960s. Boda&#x27;s reputation began to wane after the 9th Party Congress in 1969 due to his ties with Lin Biao (with whom he had closely collaborated in the publication of the Little Red Book) and his opposition to Zhou Enlai&#x27;s attempt to deescalate the Cultural Revolution and refocus on consolidating the Party. This marked the end of Chen Boda&#x27;s involvement in the cultural revolution. As the leadership became more moderate in its outlook and the initial aims of the cultural revolution were sidelined, Chen&#x27;s radicalism caused concern, and he was denounced at the 10th Party Congress in 1973 as a &#x27;revisionist secret agent&#x27; for his associations with Lin Biao.

==Later life==
After the Cultural Revolution, he was tried by the post-Mao government for collaboration with the Gang of Four. He was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, but was released under parole shortly afterwards due to his ill health, and his parole time ended in 1988. He died on 20 September 1989, at the age of 85.

<text>Seabury Ford (October 15, 1801 – May 8, 1855) was a Whig politician from Ohio. He served as the 20th governor of Ohio and was the last Whig to serve as governor.

==Early life==
Ford was born in Cheshire, Connecticut and moved to Burton, Ohio with his parents in 1804. He studied at Burton Academy, and then graduated from Yale University. While at Yale, he was elected by his classmates as class &quot;bully&quot;, a term of honor for the physically strongest man in the class.

==Career==
Ford graduated from Yale in 1825, returned to Ohio, and read law under the direction of his uncle, Judge Peter Hitchcock. He commenced the practice of law in 1827. While practicing law, Ford became involved in the state militia and was promoted to the rank of major general. Ford married Harriet E. Cook of Burton in 1828.

In 1835, Ford was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives from Geauga County. He held this position three times, and served as speaker for one term. From 1841 to 1848, he served in the Ohio State Senate.

After serving in the General Assembly, Ford was elected to the governorship in late 1848, by a margin of 311 votes out of nearly 300,000 cast. Ford served only a single term before returning home. His term was marred by fighting in a highly partisan Assembly that was divided over issues related to slavery and the Mexican–American War, as well as by a cholera epidemic that swept through Columbus.

==Death==
On the first Sunday after his retirement, Ford suffered a stroke and was stricken by paralysis, from which he never recovered. He died at his home in Burton in 1855 when he was 53 years old. Ford is interred at Welton Cemetery in Burton, Ohio.

<text>David Thomas Mason (born 10 May 1946) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist from Worcester, who first found fame with the rock band Traffic, and went on to play and record with many notable pop and rock musicians, including Paul McCartney, George Harrison, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Leon Russell, and Cass Elliot.

One of Mason&#x27;s best known songs is &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot;, recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot; became a signature song for Delaney and Bonnie, and &quot;We Just Disagree&quot;, Mason&#x27;s 1977 solo U.S. hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of U.S. classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.
In 2004, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney, the same year as he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic.

==Musical career==
===Traffic===
Mason&#x27;s tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, &quot;Traffic&quot; (1968), after which he left again. &quot;Last Exit&quot; (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song &quot;Just for You&quot;. Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot;. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never did quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled, &quot;We all [Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood] tended to write together, but Mason would come in with a complete song that he was going to sing and tell us all what he expected us to play. No discussion, like we were his backing group.&quot;

===Session work===
Mason was a friend of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, whose rock career was launched in England in 1966. Hendrix first heard the song &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, from Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, with Mason at the apartment of a friend who had acquired a prior release of the album. Hendrix recorded his own version at Olympic Studios, South West London, with Mason playing 12-string acoustic guitar. The song was released on the album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; in September 1968. Mason also sings backing vocals on &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot;. When it came out as a single in October, it hit No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart and reached the Top 40 in the US. Mason later recorded his own version of the song for his 1974 album, &quot;Dave Mason&quot;, with Bob Glaub on bass.
Mason appears on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, playing the Shehnai and bass drum on &quot;Street Fighting Man.&quot; Mason&#x27;s connection was Jimmy Miller, who served as producer for the Stones and Traffic. In 1969–1970, Mason toured with Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, along with Eric Clapton and George Harrison. Mason appears on George Harrison&#x27;s 1970 solo set &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, which was withdrawn from sale and eventually released on Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1988 box set &quot;Crossroads&quot;. He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. He co-wrote the song &quot;Big Thirst&quot; on &quot;Oh How We Danced&quot;, by Jim Capaldi (Mason&#x27;s bandmate in the Hellions, Deep Feeling, and Traffic), and played the guitar solo on &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Hero&quot;.

===Solo career===
After Traffic, Mason pursued a moderately successful solo career. His first single was &quot;Just for You&quot;; on the B-side, &quot;Little Woman&quot;, he was backed by the band Family, following his production of Family&#x27;s first album, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Music in a Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (which included &quot;Never Like This&quot;, an original Mason song). He released his first solo album in 1970 &quot;Alone Together&quot; featuring &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot;, which reached No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, as well as the lesser hit &quot;Look at You, Look at Me&quot;. A collaboration with Cass Elliot followed in 1971. In the early 1970s Mason enlisted his friend, singer-songwriter Ray Kennedy, to tour and write for his next album. In the mid- to late 1970s, he toured and recorded with guitarist Jim Krueger, keyboardist Mike Finnigan, bassist Gerald Johnson and drummer Rick Jaeger. Mason followed up with the album,&quot; Let It Flow&quot;, released in April 1977. The album peaked at only No. 37, but was in the charts for 49 weeks and went platinum as a result of the success of the album single &quot;We Just Disagree&quot;, which was written by Mason&#x27;s backup guitarist, Jim Krueger. The single topped at #12, and other album singles &quot;So High (Rock Me Baby and Roll Me Away)&quot; and &quot;Let It Go, Let It Flow&quot; also charted in the U.S. Mason&#x27;s next album was &quot;Mariposa de Oro&quot;, released in 1978. The album contained a cover of &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,&quot; which became a Top 40 single; the album itself reached number 41 and went gold. Mason played himself in the film &quot;Skatetown, U.S.A.&quot;, performing two songs in a roller disco as well as writing and performing the film&#x27;s theme song.

In 1980 Mason released &quot;Old Crest on a New Wave&quot;; the album stalled at number 74 and had one single make the charts, &quot;Save Me.&quot; The failure of the album resulted in Mason leaving his label Columbia. Mason struggled to attract another major label but continued to tour in an acoustic duo with Krueger. In 1987, he released two albums, &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot; on the Canadian label Maze Records and &quot;Two Hearts&quot; on MCA Records; the latter album featured the single &quot;Dreams I Dream,&quot; a duet with Phoebe Snow that reached number 11 in the adult contemporary charts.

In 1997, Mason was scheduled to be a member of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band, performing &quot;Only You Know and I Know,&quot; &quot;We Just Disagree&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright,&quot; but he was dropped from rehearsals before the tour started.

In 1998, Mason reunited with his former Traffic bandmate Jim Capaldi for The 40,000 Headmen Tour; a live album followed the tour. In 2002, he released the DVD &quot;Dave Mason: Live at Sunrise&quot;, a recording of a live performance at the Sunrise Musical Theater in Sunrise, Florida, backed by Bobby Scumaci on keyboards, Johnne Sambataro on rhythm guitar (who rejoined Mason for the DVD, after previously touring with him in 1978), John Lundahl on rhythm guitar, Richard Campbell on bass and Greg Babcock on drums. In 2008 Mason released his first studio album in more than 20 years, titled &quot;26 Letters 12 Notes&quot;. He followed up with another album in 2014 called &quot;Future&#x27;s Past&quot;.

As of 2018, Mason was continuing to perform in the US, including a 2018 tour with Steve Cropper.

===Tenure in Fleetwood Mac===
For a brief period in the mid-1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album &quot;Time&quot; with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994–95, including opening for REO Speedwagon and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

Mason was never entirely comfortable during his time in Fleetwood Mac. He has said several times since leaving the band: &quot;Being one of two and at times three guitarists to replace Lindsey Buckingham says more about Buckingham&#x27;s genius than my guitar playing&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Mason moved permanently to the United States in 1971, and lived in the Ojai Valley in California for 16 years. As of September 2017 he had homes in Carson City, Nevada and Hawaii.

==Philanthropy==
Mason is a proponent of music education for children. In 2005, he signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a non-profit organization that provides free musical instruments and lessons to children in American public schools. He sits on the organization&#x27;s board of directors as an honorary member.

Mason also is a founding board member of Yoga Blue, a non-profit organisation devoted to teaching yoga and other holistic practices to those recovering from substance abuse and other self-destructive disorders.

Mason and his longtime friend Ted Knapp have founded Rock Our Vets, an all-volunteer 501(c)3 charity supported by many other musicians, helping military veterans and the families of law enforcement and firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty. The charity has focused on providing food and clothing to homeless veterans, laptop computers for veterans aspiring to continue their education, as well as suicide prevention.

<doc id="701861" wikidata="Q379603" url="?curid=701861" title="Tony Yeboah">
<text>Anthony Yeboah (born 6 June 1966) is a Ghanaian former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He is considered one of the most prominent and prolific goal scorers in Ghanaian and African football history and gained a reputation for scoring spectacular goals which often featured in Goal of the Month or Goal of the Season competitions in the 1990s.

Yeboah is most noted for his time at European clubs 1. FC Saarbrücken, Eintracht Frankfurt, Leeds United and Hamburger SV. He also played for Asante Kotoko, Cornerstones Kumasi, Okwawu United and Al-Ittihad Doha. He was capped 59 times by Ghana, scoring 29 goals. He now runs an international sports agency and a chain of hotels in Ghana. He won the Bundesliga golden boot on two occasions, 1992–93 and 1993–94, playing for Eintracht Frankfurt.

==Club career==
Yeboah was born in Kumasi, Ghana. After spending his youth in Kumasi, Yeboah joined German club 1. FC Saarbrücken in 1988. This move was of some historical significance, because Yeboah became one of the first black players to appear in the Bundesliga. Yeboah had a slow first year, but then scored 17 league goals in his second Saarbrücken year.

===Eintracht Frankfurt===
Yeboah moved to Eintracht Frankfurt in 1990, where he was at first booed by a section of fans and—being the first black player the team had ever signed—subjected to monkey-noises and other racist insults. In the Hesse metropolis, Yeboah quickly established himself and became the first African Bundesliga club captain. He was the top Bundesliga scorer twice with Eintracht, in 1993 and 1994. 

In December 1994 Eintracht&#x27;s new manager Jupp Heynckes ordered extra training for Yeboah, Jay Jay Okocha and Maurizio Gaudino, who subsequently made themselves unavailable for the next fixture and were then suspended indefinitely by the club. Heynckes had also removed the captaincy from Yeboah, whom he considered to be three kilos overweight. Yeboah later attributed a racist motive to Heynckes and was also unhappy at Eintracht blocking his prospective transfer to Bayern Munich. 

===Leeds United===
Yeboah joined English club Leeds United from Eintracht Frankfurt in January 1995, initially on loan but with an option to sign permanently for £3.4 million. He scored 12 times in 21 league appearances as Leeds finished fifth in the FA Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup. In his second season at Elland Road, he was voted Player of the Year. Yeboah scored a total of 32 goals for Leeds United in 66 appearances, and is still revered as a cult hero for the Yorkshire club due to a series of memorable goals he scored. His volley against Liverpool and his strike versus Wimbledon in the 1995–96 season were among his most notable goals, and he was a regular feature in Goal of the Month in the Premier League. He told Newstalk&#x27;s Team 33 in 2014 that his favourite goal was the one he scored against Liverpool. The goal against Wimbledon was awarded Goal of the Season in 1995–96. Until Gareth Bale equalled the feat in 2013, Yeboah was the only player ever to win successive BBC Match of the Day Goal of the Month competitions, doing so in September and October 1995.

He also scored three hat-tricks for Leeds; the first against Ipswich Town in the Premier League at Elland Road on 5 April 1995, which made him only the third foreign player to score a league hat-trick for Leeds (Cantona v Tottenham in August 1992 was the first, and Phil Masinga three months earlier in an FA Cup tie). Yeboah&#x27;s second hat-trick came against Monaco in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup on 12 September 1995, and the third 11 days later in the Premier League match against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park which included the aforementioned Goal of the Season. A video was released named ‘Yeboah – Shoot to Kill’ while he was at Leeds. 

Injuries (several picked up while on international duty) restricted his game when he played and kept him out of the Leeds side on several occasions. He also developed a well-documented fondness for Yorkshire pudding. A knee injury curtailed his appearances at the end of 1995–96 and he underwent surgery in August 1996. When George Graham took over as Leeds manager in September 1996 he used Yeboah sparingly, considering him to be unfit. This brought about a rift between player and coach, which culminated in Yeboah throwing his shirt in the direction of the bench after being substituted in a 1–0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in March 1997. 

Yeboah failed to report back for pre-season training ahead of 1997–98, hoping to force a transfer. He was sold to Hamburger SV in September 1997 for a fee of around £1 million, having played just six times in the 1996–97 season under Graham.

===Later career===
Yeboah remained with his German club Hamburger SV until 2001, scoring 28 goals. In January 2001 he was convicted on tax evasion charges relating to a signing on fee he had received when extending his Eintracht Frankfurt contract in 1993. He was fined 360,000 marks by the court and then fell into another financial dispute with the lawyer who had defended him in the case. After making just five appearances in the 2001–02 Hamburger SV season, he began negotiating a release from the final months of his contract in November 2001. He left in order to join Al Ittihad of the Qatar Stars League in December 2001, where he played under Austrian coach Josef Hickersberger.

==International career==
He was a member of Ghana&#x27;s national team for over ten years, and represented his country at three Africa Cup of Nations during the 1990s. Yeboah reportedly scored 29 goals in 59 appearances for Ghana, the fourth highest goalscoring total in the nation&#x27;s history behind Asamoah Gyan, Edward Acquah and Kwasi Owusu. RSSSF records credit Yeboah with 15 goals in 56 caps.

Yeboah featured for Ghana in their 1992 African Cup of Nations final defeat, but the occasion was marred by a dispute over the team captaincy. With Abedi Pele suspended, regular vice-captain Yeboah was controversially overlooked for the captaincy in favour of Anthony Baffoe.

==Post-playing career==
On 3 November 2008, he was appointed as the new chairman of the newly promoted Ghana Premier League club Berekum Chelsea.

==Personal life==
Yeboah entered Germany with a passport which stated his year of birth as 1964. He later modified this to 1966, explaining that he had used the pretend 1964 birth year to gain early access to senior football in Ghana when he was only 17 years old.

Yeboah along with his cousin former Mainz player Michael Osei runs an international sports agency called &quot;Anthony Yeboah Sportpromotion&quot; and owns a chain of hotels in Ghana (Accra, Kumasi) called &quot;Yegoala&quot;. He is married and has two children.

His nephews, Kelvin and Obed Yeboah, are also professional footballers.

<text>Zhang Guotao (November 26, 1897 – December 3, 1979) was a Chinese revolutionary who was a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and rival to Mao Zedong. During the 1920s he studied in the Soviet Union and became a key contact with the Comintern, organizing the CCP labor movement in the United Front with the Kuomintang. From 1931 to 1932, after the Party had been driven from the cities, Zhang was placed in charge of the Eyuwan Soviet. When his armies were driven from the region, he joined the Long March but lost a contentious struggle for party leadership to Mao Zedong. Zhang&#x27;s armies then took a different route from Mao&#x27;s and were badly beaten by local Muslim Ma clique forces in Gansu. When his depleted forces finally arrived to join Mao in Yan&#x27;an, Zhang continued his losing challenge to Mao, and left the party in 1938. Zhang eventually retired to Canada, in 1968. He became a Christian shortly before his death in Scarborough, Ontario (a suburb of Toronto), in 1979. His memoirs provide valuable and vivid information on his life and party history.

== Early and student life ==
Born in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi, Zhang was involved in revolutionary activities during his youth. Zhang studied Marxism under Li Dazhao while attending Peking University in 1916. After his active role in the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Zhang became one of the most prominent student leaders and later joined the early organization of the CCP in October 1920. At the same time, Mao Zedong was a librarian working at Peking University; the two knew each other. Zhang acted as the CCP&#x27;s top party official at the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 and was elected a member of the Central Bureau of the CCP in charge of organizing the work of Professional revolutionaries. After the congress, Zhang held the position of Director of Secretariat of the China Labor Union and Chief Editor of &quot;Labor Weekly&quot;, from which he became an expert in labor unions and mobilization. He led several major strikes of railway and textile workers, which made him a pioneer of the labor movement in China along with such figures as Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan.

== Communist Party career ==
===Early career===
In 1924 Zhang attended the First National Congress of the Kuomintang (KMT) during the policy of alliance between the Communists and the Kuomintang and was elected as Substitute Commissioner of Central Executive Committee. This was despite the fact that Zhang had opposed the alliance with Kuomintang in the Third National Congress of the CCP and had been reprimanded. In 1925 in the Fourth National Congress of the CCP, Zhang was elected Commissioner of Central Committee of CCP and Director of Labor &amp; Peasant Work Department. In 1926 Zhang was the General Secretary of Hubei Division of CCP, and in 1927 he was Commissioner of Interim Central Committee of the CCP after the failure of the CCP uprising. Zhang with Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai were the acting leaders of the CCP. At that time Mao only led a small number of troops in Jiangxi and Hunan. In 1928 Zhang went to Moscow for the second time. He opposed Wang Ming and the rest of the &quot;28 Bolsheviks&quot;, a group of Chinese students in Moscow. Nonetheless, Zhang was elected as a member of the politburo of the CCP in the Sixth National Congress held in Soviet Union, and then as a delegate of the CCP in Comintern. Zhang and the 28 Bolsheviks were mostly reconciled by 1930, however, and Zhang returned to China.

===Leader of the Eyuwan Soviet===
In Zhang&#x27;s absence, Li Lisan had become &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the CCP. His &quot;Li Lisan line&quot; called for the rural soviets to launch immediate attacks on major cities, which had ended in disastrous failure. In the winter of 1930-1931, Zhang and the 28 Bolsheviks ousted Li from power and set about bringing the far-flung rural soviets under more centralized control. Zhang was sent to the Eyuwan Soviet on the border of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui provinces. Zhang came into immediate conflict with the leaders of the Fourth Red Army. Xu Jishen and the other commanders wanted to seize the breadbasket counties in eastern Hubei to fix Eyuwan&#x27;s chronic food shortages. Zhang compared the plan to Li Lisan&#x27;s &quot;adventurism&quot;, and when they disobeyed his orders and took the land anyways, he got permission from the Central Committee to make Chen Changhao political commissar of the Fourth Red Army. Zhang and Chen accused the Fourth Red Army was acting like a &quot;warlord-bandit&quot; force, pillaging the countryside and rejecting proper discipline. Zhang and Chen then purged the army of hundreds of alleged traitors, including Xu.

Zhang&#x27;s purges expanded during the second half of 1931. Thousands or tens of thousands of party members were arrested and accused of being part of the Reorganizationists, the Anti-Bolshevik League, or the Third Party. In some counties, Zhang even set up secret police. Zhang&#x27;s main justification for the purge was that the local party was too strongly intertwined with local gentry and the traditional rural power structure. He argued that this had prevented the party from carrying out land reform properly, and land reform under Zhang went much further than it had in previous years. Zhang appointed a Red Army officer named to chairman of the Eyuwan Soviet. Gao had a reputation for brutality against rich peasants and landlords. In order to &quot;comb out&quot; rich peasants, any Red army soldiers who were literate were dismissed. The purges led to opposition against Zhang from wide sections of the party and peasantry. They eventually came to an end during the latter half of 1932. Soldiers who had been purged for their literacy but had stayed with the Red Army were allowed to rejoin and in some instances promoted. The overall impact and scale of the purges are disputed. Reasonable estimates of the number arrested and killed range from the low thousands to 10,000. Historian William Rowe argues that this &quot;meant... the near final extinction of the Party&#x27;s base of indigenous supporters&quot; in Eyuwan, but most other historians disagree. Benton points out that almost all of the purged cadres were replaced with other local supporters since there were very few non-native Communists in the region. Tony Saich argues that the Red Army&#x27;s continued success showed that the purges had not affected the army&#x27;s fighting capacity. In early 1932, the Fourth Red Army had helped defeat the Third Encirclement Campaign and reached 30,000 soldiers.

=== Retreat and the Long March ===

In 1932, the Nationalists&#x27; fourth encirclement campaign finally broke the Fourth Red Army and Zhang was forced to lead a retreat westwards. The main force lost half of its troops during the fighting and subsequent retreat, being reduced to 15,000 men. In the border region between Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces he decided to set up a new base. Slowly he turned it into a prosperous autonomous region by way of land reform and enlisting the support of locals, establishing the Northwest Chinese Soviet Federation. However, once the prosperity was in reach, Zhang launched another series of purges. As a result, he and the Red Army lost the popular support, and was driven from the Red base. In 1935 Zhang and his army of more than 80,000 reunited with Mao&#x27;s 10,000 troops during the Long March. It was not long before Mao and Zhang were locked in disagreements over issues of strategy and tactics, causing a split in the Red Army. The main disagreement was Zhang&#x27;s insistence on moving southward to establish a new base in the region of Sichuan that was populated by ethnic minorities. Mao pointed out the flaws of such a move, pointing out the difficulties to establish any communist base in regions where the general populace was hostile, and insisted on moving northward to reach the communist base in Shaanxi. Zhang tried to have Mao and his followers arrested and killed if needed, but his plan was foiled by his own staff members Ye Jianying and Yang Shangkun, who fled to Mao&#x27;s headquarters to inform Mao about Zhang&#x27;s plot, taking all of the codebooks and maps with them. As a result, Mao immediately moved his troop northward and thus escaped arrest and possible death.

Zhang decided to carry out his plan on his own, with disastrous results: over 75% of his original 80,000 + troops were lost in his adventure. Zhang was forced to admit defeat and retreat to the communist base in Shaanxi. More disastrous than losing most of his troops, the failure discredited Zhang among his own followers, who turned to Mao. Furthermore, because all of the codebooks were obtained by Mao, Zhang lost contact with Comintern while Mao was able to establish the link, this coupled with the fact of Zhang&#x27;s disastrous defeat, discredited Zhang within Comintern, which begun to give greater support for Mao.

Zhang&#x27;s remaining troops of 21,800 were later annihilated in 1936 by the superior force of more than 100,000 combined troops of warlords Ma Bufang, Ma Hongbin and Ma Zhongying during efforts to cross the Yellow River and conquer Ma&#x27;s territory. Zhang lost the power and influence to be able to challenge Mao and had to accept his failure as a result of the disaster which only left him 427 surviving troops from the original 21,800.

In 2006, the writer and producer, Sun Shuyun, provided an account of the Long March that took exception to various ways in which the event has been propagandized. Although critical of Zhang Guotao, she argued that there was no evidence of a so-called &quot;secret telegram&quot; that had been intercepted by Mao in which Zhang intended to use force against the Central Committee. Moreover, she shows that the official History of the Chinese Communist Party was revised in 2002 to say that Zhang Guotao did not order the Western Legion into Gansu in order to build up his own power base. Rather, all orders originated from the Central Committee .

== End of CCP career and exile ==

When Zhang reached the new CCP base at Yan&#x27;an, he had fallen from power and became an easy target for Mao. Zhang kept the now figurehead position of Chairman of Yan&#x27;an Frontier Area and was frequently subjected to humiliation by Mao and his allies. Zhang was too proud to ally with Wang Ming, who had recently come back from Moscow and was acting as the Comintern&#x27;s representative in China. Zhang&#x27;s popularity in the Comintern might have given him another chance of returning to power if he had allied with Wang. Another reason why Zhang did not ally with Wang was that Wang boasted that it was under his order that five senior CCP leaders (Yu Xiusong, Huang Chao, Li Te and two others—all opponents of Wang) had been arrested, and now worked for warlord Sheng Shicai in Xinjiang under the direction of the CCP. All five were tortured and executed in a prison under the control of Sheng Shicai, having been labeled as Trotskyists. However, Sheng Shicai was acting under direction from the CCP under Wang Ming. After that incident, Zhang despised Wang and would never consider supporting him.

Without any supporters, Zhang was purged in 1937 at the Extended Meeting of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, after which he defected to the Kuomintang in 1938. But without any power, resources, and support, Zhang never held any important positions afterward and only did research on the CCP for Dai Li. After the defeat of the Kuomintang in 1949 he went into exile in Hong Kong. He emigrated to Canada with his wife Tzi Li Young in 1968 to join their two sons who were already living in Toronto. 

He gave his only interview in 1974, when he told a Canadian Press reporter, &quot;I have washed my hands of politics&quot;. In 1978, he converted to Christianity under the influence of a Chinese scholar, Zhang Li Sang. After suffering several strokes, he died in a Scarborough, Ontario, nursing home on December 3, 1979, at the age of 82. He is buried in the Pine Hills Cemetery in Scarborough.

Zhang was highly critical of the proceedings of the first PRC Police leader Luo Ruiqing during the Chinese Civil War.

<text>Emily Murphy (born Emily Gowan Ferguson; 14 March 186826 October 1933) was a Canadian women&#x27;s rights activist and author. In 1916, she became the first female magistrate in Canada and the fifth in the British Empire after Elizabeth Webb Nicholls, Jane Price, E. Cullen and Cecilia Dixon of Australia (all appointed to office in 1915). She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism, specifically to the question of whether women were &quot;persons&quot; under Canadian law. 

Murphy is known as one of &quot;The Famous Five&quot; (also called &quot;The Valiant Five&quot;)—a group of Canadian women&#x27;s rights activists that also included Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney and Irene Parlby. In 1927, the women launched the &quot;Persons Case,&quot; contending that women could be &quot;qualified persons&quot; eligible to sit in the Senate. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they were not. However, upon appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, the court of last resort for Canada at that time, the women won their case.

However, there has been some criticism of her later work, mainly for her role in the &quot;Sexual Sterilization Act&quot; of Alberta and her allegations that a ring of immigrants from other countries, particularly China, would corrupt the white race by getting Canadians hooked on drugs. In her book &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, she wrote: &quot;It is hardly credible that the average Chinese peddler has any definite idea in his mind of bringing about the downfall of the white race, his swaying motive being probably that of greed, but in the hands of his superiors, he may become a powerful instrument to that end.&quot;

==Early life==
Emily Murphy was born in Cookstown, Ontario, the third child of Isaac Ferguson and Emily Gowan. Isaac Ferguson was a successful businessman and property owner. As a child, Murphy frequently joined her two older brothers Thomas and Gowan in their adventures; their father encouraged this behaviour and often had his sons and daughters share responsibilities equally.

Murphy grew up under the influence of her maternal grandfather, Ogle R. Gowan, a politician who founded a local branch of the Orange Order in 1830, and two uncles, one a Supreme Court justice and the other a senator. Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court. Another uncle was Thomas Roberts Ferguson, an MP, and she was related to James Robert Gowan, who was a lawyer, judge, and senator.

Murphy benefited from parents who supported their daughter&#x27;s receiving a formal academic education. She attended Bishop Strachan School, an exclusive Anglican private school for girls in Toronto where, through a friend, she met her future husband Arthur Murphy, who was 11 years her senior.

In 1887, they married, and subsequently had four daughters: Madeleine, Evelyn, Doris and Kathleen. Doris died. After Doris&#x27;s death, the family decided to try a new setting and moved west to Swan River, Manitoba, in 1903 and then to Edmonton, Alberta, in 1907.

== Career ==

=== Dower Act ===
While Arthur was working as an Anglican priest, Murphy explored her new surroundings and became increasingly aware of the poverty that existed.

At the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women&#x27;s groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects. In addition to these organizations, Murphy began to speak openly and frankly about the disadvantaged and the poor living conditions that surrounded their society.

Her strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless. At that time, property laws did not leave the wife with any legal recourse.

This case motivated Murphy to create a campaign that assured the property rights of married women. With the support of many rural women, Murphy began to pressure the Alberta government to allow women to retain the rights of their land. In 1916, Murphy successfully persuaded the Alberta legislature to pass the Dower Act that would allow a woman legal rights to one-third of her husband&#x27;s property. Murphy&#x27;s reputation as a women&#x27;s rights activist was established by this first political victory. 

===Appointment as female magistrate===
Murphy&#x27;s success in the fight for the Dower Act, along with her work through the Local Council of Women and her increasing awareness of women&#x27;s rights, influenced her request for a female magistrate in the women&#x27;s court.

In 1916, Murphy, along with a group of women, attempted to observe a trial for women who were prostitutes and were arrested for &quot;questionable&quot; circumstances. The women were asked to leave the courtroom on the claims that the statement was not &quot;fit for mixed company&quot;. This outcome was unacceptable to Murphy and she protested to the provincial Attorney General. &quot;If the evidence is not fit company,&quot; she argued, &quot;then the government must set up a special court presided over by women, to try other women&quot;.

Murphy&#x27;s request was approved and she became the first woman police magistrate in the British Empire.

However, her appointment as a judge became the cause for her greatest adversity concerning women within the law. In her first case in Alberta on 1 July 1916, she found the prisoner guilty. The prisoner&#x27;s lawyer called into question her right to pass a sentence since she was not legally a person. The Provincial Supreme Court denied the appeal.

=== Persons case ===
In 1917, she headed the battle to have women declared as &quot;persons&quot; in Canada, and, consequently, qualified to serve in the Senate. With the achievement of female suffrage achieved (or about to be) at least in English Canada, the legal obstacle preventing the appointment of women to the Senate was the last area in which women were not legal equals to men in Canadian political affairs. 
Edmonton lawyer, Eardley Jackson, challenged her position as judge because women were not considered &quot;persons&quot; under the British North America Act 1867. This understanding was based on a British common law ruling of 1876, which stated, &quot;women were eligible for pains and penalties, but not rights and privileges.&quot;
His appeal was rejected out of hand.

In 1919, Murphy presided over the inaugural conference of the Federated Women&#x27;s Institutes of Canada, which passed a resolution calling for a female senator to be appointed. The National Council of Women and the Montreal Women&#x27;s Club also supported the resolution, selecting Murphy as their preferred candidate.

Murphy began to work on a plan to ask for clarification of how women were regarded in the BNA act and how they were to become Senators. She enlisted the help of four other Albertan women and on 27 August 1927 she and human rights activist and ex-MLA Nellie McClung, ex-MLA Louise McKinney, women&#x27;s rights campaigner and author Henrietta Edwards, and sitting Alberta cabinet minister and MLA Irene Parlby signed the petition to the federal Cabinet, asking that the federal government refer the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada. 

The women&#x27;s petition set out two questions, but the federal government re-framed it as one question, asking the Supreme Court: &quot;Does the word &#x27;person&#x27; in Section 24 of the British North America Act include female persons?&quot; 

The campaign became known as &quot;The Persons Case&quot; and reached the Supreme Court of Canada in March 1928. The Court held that women were not qualified to sit in the Senate. The five women then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain. On 18 October 1929, in a decision called Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), the Privy Council declared that &#x27;persons&#x27; in Section 24 of the BNA Act of 1867 should be interpreted to include both males and females; therefore, women were eligible to serve in the Senate.

Despite the ruling, Murphy never did serve in the Senate. After the ruling, the first seat to open up in the Senate was in Quebec - Murphy lived in Alberta. As well, the Prime Minister at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, was a Liberal, and Murphy was a partisan Conservative. She was passed over in favour of philanthropist Cairine Wilson in 1930. 

After the Conservatives under R. B. Bennett won the 1930 federal election, Murphy was denied a chance to sit in the Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and Murphy was a Protestant. (Meat-packer Robert Burns got the seat.) Murphy died in 1933 without fulfilling her dream of sitting in Canada&#x27;s upper chamber.

The five appellants in the Person&#x27;s Case were known as the Famous Five (or the Valiant Five) and were considered leaders in education for social reform and women&#x27;s rights. They challenged convention and established an important precedent in Canadian history. In Canada&#x27;s Senate Chamber, the five women are honoured with a plaque that reads, &quot;To further the cause of womankind these five outstanding pioneer women caused steps to be taken resulting in the recognition by the Privy Council of women as persons eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada.&quot; Murphy, along with the rest of the Famous Five, was featured on the back of one of the Canadian 50-dollar bills issued in 2004 as part of the Canadian Journey Series. 

In October 2009, the Senate voted to name Murphy and the rest of the Five Canada&#x27;s first &quot;honorary senators&quot;.

==Views==
===Drugs and race===

Although Murphy&#x27;s views on race changed over the course of her life, the perspective contained in her book &quot;The Black Candle&quot; is considered the most consequential because it played a role in creating a widespread &quot;war on drugs mentality&quot; leading to legislation that &quot;defined addiction as a law enforcement problem&quot;. A series of articles in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine under her pen name, &quot;Janey Canuck&quot;, forms the basis of &quot;The Black Candle&quot;. Using extensive anecdotes and &quot;expert&quot; opinion, &quot;The Black Candle&quot; depicts an alarming picture of drug abuse in Canada, detailing Murphy&#x27;s understanding of the use and effects of opium, cocaine, and pharmaceuticals, as well as a &quot;new menace&quot;, &quot;marijuana&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s concern with drugs began when she started coming into &quot;disproportionate contact with Chinese people&quot; in her courtroom because they were over-represented in the criminal justice system. In addition to professional expertise and her own observations, Murphy was also given a tour of opium dens in Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown by local police detectives. Vancouver at the time was in the midst of a moral panic over drugs that was part of the anti-Asian campaign that precipitated the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923.

Canadian drug historian Catherine Carstairs has argued that there is little documentary evidence on which to determine how early Canadian drug policy was formed. Although Murphy&#x27;s anti-drug screeds were widely read and helped spread the drug panic across Canada, she was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with. According to Carstairs, &quot;There were insinuations in the records that the bureaucrats at the division of narcotic control did not think highly of Emily Murphy and did not pay attention to what she was writing about. They didn&#x27;t consider her a particularly accurate or valuable source.&quot;

Carstairs also states that while Murphy was not the primary cause of the drug panic in Vancouver, but that nevertheless &quot;her articles did mark a turning point and her book ... brought the Vancouver drug panic to a larger Canadian audience&quot;.

Race permeates &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, and is intricately entwined with the drug trade and addiction in Murphy&#x27;s analysis. Yet she is ambiguous in her treatment of non-whites. In one passage, for example, she chastises whites who use the Chinese as &quot;scapegoats&quot;, while elsewhere, she refers to the Chinese man as a &quot;visitor&quot; in this country, and that &quot;it might be wise to put him out&quot; if it turns out that this visitor carries &quot;poisoned lollipops in his pocket and feeds them to our children&quot;. Drug addiction, however, not the Chinese immigrant, is &quot;a scourge so dreadful in its effects that it threatens the very foundations of civilization&quot;, and which laws, therefore, need to target for eradication. Drugs victimize everyone, and members of all races perpetuate the drug trade, according to Murphy. At the same time, she does not depart from the dominant view of middle class whites at the time that &quot;races&quot; were discrete, biologically determined categories, naturally ranked in a hierarchy. In this scheme, the white race was facing degradation through miscegenation, while the more prolific &quot;black and yellow races may yet obtain the ascendancy&quot; and thus threatened to &quot;wrest the leadership of the world from the British&quot;.

Murphy&#x27;s distaste for non-whites is reflected in scholarly debates, but what is not controversial is that &quot;The Black Candle&quot; was written &quot;for the express purpose of arousing public demands for stricter drug legislation&quot; and that in this she was to some degree successful. This motivation may have influenced her racial analysis by playing to the popular prejudices of her white audiences. On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and excitable Asian exclusionists in British Columbia to maximize her credibility and sway her more moderate readers.

===Eugenics movement===

During the early twentieth century, scientific knowledge emerged at the forefront of social importance. Advances in science and technology were thought to hold answers to current and future social problems.

Murphy was among those who thought that societal problems like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime resulted from mental deficiencies. In a 1932 article titled &quot;Overpopulation and Birth Control&quot;, she states: &quot;over-population [is a] basic problem of all ... none of our troubles can even be allayed until this is remedied&quot;. As the politics behind the Second World War continued to develop, Murphy, who was a pacifist, theorized that the only reason for war was that nation needed to fight for land to accommodate their growing populations. She argued that people would not need as much land if there was population control. Without the constant need for more land, the war would cease to exist.

Her solution to these social issues was eugenics. Murphy supported selective breeding and the compulsory sterilization of those individuals who were considered mentally deficient. She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the &quot;human thoroughbreds&quot; and appealed to the Alberta Legislative Assembly for forced sterilization. In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were &quot;a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state ... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition&quot;. She wrote to the UFA government&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture and Health, George Hoadley that two female &quot;feeble-minded&quot; mental patients had already bred several offspring. She called it &quot;a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children&quot;.

The UFA government brought in a eugenics law in 1928, requiring parents&#x27; or guardians&#x27; approval of the operation. Later, after Murphy&#x27;s death, William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit government amended the law to allow forced sterilization.

Due in part to Murphy&#x27;s heavy advocacy of compulsory sterilization, thousands of Albertan men and women were sterilized without their knowledge or consent under the &quot;Sexual Sterilization Act&quot; before its repeal in 1972.

==Legacy==
Her legacy is disputed, with her important contributions to feminism being weighed against her racist and nativist views and her advocation of eugenics. In addition to being against immigration, she was a strong supporter of Alberta&#x27;s legislation for the &quot;Sexual Sterilization of the Insane&quot; at a time when compulsory sterilization was practised in some North American jurisdictions.

Recent memorializing of the Famous Five, such as the illustration on the back of the fifty-dollar bill, has been used as the occasion for re-evaluating Murphy&#x27;s legacy. Marijuana decriminalization activists especially have criticized Murphy as part of the movement to discredit marijuana prohibition. It has been speculated that today&#x27;s drug laws are built on the racist foundations laid by Murphy and that the drug war has harmed more women than the Persons Case has benefited. Conversely, Murphy&#x27;s defenders note that she was writing at a time when white racism was typical, not exceptional and that Murphy&#x27;s views were more progressive than many of her peers.

Emily Murphy&#x27;s house in Edmonton, Alberta (at 11011 - 88th Avenue) is on the Canadian Register of Historic People and Places. She lived in this home from 1919 until she died in 1933. It is now located on the campus of the University of Alberta and houses the Student Legal Services.

In 1958, she was recognized as a Person of National Historic Significance by the government of Canada. A plaque commemorating this is installed at Emily Murphy Park on Emily Murphy Park Road in Edmonton. The &quot;National Persons&quot; case was recognized in 1997 as a National Historic Event with a plaque at the same place.

<text>William Bebb (December 8, 1802October 23, 1873) was a Whig politician from Ohio. He served as the 19th governor of Ohio from 1846 to 1849 and was the third native Ohioan to be elected to the office.

==Early life==
Bebb was born in what was then Hamilton County in the Northwest Territory (his birthplace is now located in modern-day Butler County, Ohio) to Welsh immigrants. He is the son of Edward Bebb and Margaret Roberts Owens. Bebb&#x27;s parents were early residents of Paddy&#x27;s Run, now known as Shandon, Ohio. In 1826 the Paddy&#x27;s Run school was organized under the new state law, a new building was erected, and William Bebb was employed as the first teacher.

On October 16, 1824 he married Sarah Shuck. In 1828, Bebb and his wife opened a boarding school for boys called the &quot;Sycamore Grove School&quot;. While he taught school, Bebb studied for the bar and passed the state bar examination. He began practicing law in 1831 and worked in the office of John Woods.

==Career==
Bebb was a devoted campaigner for William Henry Harrison in 1840, and for Henry Clay in 1844. Bebb was a Presidential elector in 1844 for Clay/Frelinghuysen.

Bebb was nominated by the Whigs in 1846 for the governorship, and served a single term beginning in December 1846. His term technically expired in December 1848, but was extended into January 1849 due to a number of close statewide elections which necessitated delaying the inauguration of a successor.

He was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as examiner in the pension office at Washington, D.C. He declined an appointment as United States Diplomat to Tangier, Morocco in 1868.

==Death==
After Bebb retired from politics, he and his wife moved to their farm in Rockford, Illinois. Bebb died at his home on October 23, 1873, and Sarah Bebb died on January 10, 1892.

Bebb was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in Rockford, Illinois.

==Trial of William Bebb==

In 1857, Bebb fired a weapon and a man died. He was accused of manslaughter, and tried in Winnebago County, Illinois Circuit Court in 1858. One of his defense council summarized the case thus: 

A fable grew out of the trial, which had Tom Corwin coming to the county anonymously before the trial, and charming its occupants to the point that, when he represented Bebb, his good will with the residents assured an acquittal. A later examination of the trial record showed the story to be fanciful, with Corwin and Johnston winning acquittal through competent representation.

<text>Joan Oró i Florensa, 1st Marquess of Oró (; 26 October 1923 – 2 September 2004) was a Spanish (Catalan) biochemist, whose research has been of importance in understanding the origin of life. Living in the United States for many years, he participated in several NASA missions, including the Apollo mission to the Moon and the Viking lander. He received the Oparin Medal for his contributions to the field of origins of life.

== Early life and education ==
Joan Oró i Florensa was born on 26 October 1923, in Lleida, Catalonia, Spain, the youngest of five children.

After completing secondary school late owing to the Spanish Civil War, he completed his undergraduate studies in chemistry, focusing on organic chemistry, at the University of Barcelona in 1947. He first tried to earn a living as a chemist, but that did not work, so he spent three years working at his father&#x27;s bakery and saving money.

After getting married and having children, he and his family moved to the United States in 1952, due to the scarce scientific resources offered by the Spanish academia at that time. He enrolled at the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas, and started doing graduate studies in chemical engineering. After working with Donald Rappoport, who was professor of biochemistry at Baylor College of Medicine, he switched to biochemistry, and in 1956 he obtained his PhD in biochemistry in Houston.

==Scientific and academic career==
Oró became a full professor in University of Houston in 1963 where he founded and directed the department of biochemistry and biophysics. From the 1960s he worked with NASA on the Viking missions which explored the planet Mars. His work was essential in the analysis of samples of Martian soil, questioning early suggestions that life might have been detected.

=== Origins of life ===
One of his most important contributions was the prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase adenine (a key component of nucleic acids) from hydrogen cyanide (HCN). He also showed that amino acids can be made from HCN plus ammonia in an aqueous solution. This was achieved during the period 1959–1962 and stands, together with the Miller-Urey experiment, as one of the fundamental results of prebiotic chemistry. It opened up a research area eventually leading to the complete synthesis of other components of nucleic acids.

=== Cometary origin of prebiotic molecules ===
Oró was also the first scientist pointing towards comets as key carriers of organic molecules to our early biosphere. This conjecture (formulated in 1961) is broadly accepted today. Although such an idea had been around for a long time, it was only when both space exploration and prebiotic chemistry fully developed that extensive evidence was in place. Comets are rich in carbon and water, bearing along precursor molecules based on carbon chemistry, such as amino acids. In this context, in 1971, Oró and co-workers published a paper revealing the high abundance of amino acids, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the Murchison meteorite and studied the optical activity of the amino acids.

=== Viking mission ===
Oró also provided a chemical interpretation of a set of remarkable, and to some extent unexpected results reported by the Viking mission to Mars. The Viking lander performed a series of experiments, including one designed by Oró, involving a small gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer. In one of these experiments, where a set of nutrients was mixed with Martian soil samples, a sudden production of carbon dioxide was reported, initially suggesting the presence of Martian microbes, which would have shown some kind of metabolic processing of nutrients. Oró showed that a simpler, abiotic interpretation was more likely to be the correct one: the catalytic chemical oxidation of test nutrients.

==Other activities==
Oró was also involved in political life after Spain&#x27;s transition to democracy as member of the Parliament of Catalonia.

He also served as a science advisor for many American projects and committees, including those involved in the International Space Station and the future missions to Mars.

==Personal life and death==
Oró married Francesca Forteza in 1948, and they had four children, the first three born in Spain and the youngest born in Houston.

Oró died in Barcelona on September 2, 2004.

<doc id="701891" wikidata="Q449487" url="?curid=701891" title="Florence R. Sabin">
<text>Florence Rena Sabin (November 9, 1871 – October 3, 1953) was an American medical scientist. She was a pioneer for women in science; she was the first woman to hold a full professorship at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and the first woman to head a department at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. During her years of retirement, she pursued a second career as a public health activist in Colorado, and in 1951 received the Albert Lasker Public Service Award for this work.

==Early life==
On November 9, 1871, Serena Sabin gave birth to her youngest daughter, Florence Rena Sabin, in Central City, Colorado. Florence&#x27;s mother was a schoolteacher who later died from puerperal fever (sepsis) in 1878. Her father, George K. Sabin, was a mining engineer living and working on site with his family. Shortly after her mother&#x27;s death, Florence and her sister (Mary) moved in with their Uncle Albert in Chicago before relocating to Vermont with their paternal grandparents.

Uncle Albert was a tremendous influence on Florence, and from her relationship with him, she developed a love of nature and a keen interest in books and music. The Sabin girls soon moved with their uncle to an old family farm in Vermont.

Florence became very interested in the life story of Levi Sabin, an ancestor who had graduated from medical school in 1798. Florence&#x27;s father had always wanted to be a doctor, but the obligations of mining overwhelmed him, and his thoughts of a medical career slowly disappeared. But Florence began to secretly harbor her father&#x27;s dream. In 1885 Florence enrolled at Vermont Academy (and graduated in 1889), where her scientific interests were finally allowed to develop.

Throughout her childhood Sabin had intentions of becoming a pianist, however, she was never musically talented, causing her to shift her focus on a future in science during her time at Vermont Academy, Saxtons River, Vermont.

== Higher education ==
Sabin earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Smith College in 1893. For two years she taught high school mathematics in Denver followed by one year of zoology at Smith as a means to finance her first year of graduate school.

In 1896, Sabin enrolled at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine as one of fourteen women in her class. The school opened in 1893 and was co-ed from the beginning because of an early donor&#x27;s contingency which required the admittance of female students.

While at Hopkins, Sabin&#x27;s observational skills and perseverance in the laboratory caught anatomist Franklin P. Mall&#x27;s attention. Mall inspired Sabin by helping narrow her focus onto two projects well regarded by scientists and foundational to her future research and consequent legacy. The first project was to produce a three-dimensional model of a newborn baby&#x27;s brain stem which became the focus of the textbook, &quot;An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain&quot; (1901). The second project involved the embryological development of the lymphatic system which asserted that the lymphatic system is formed from the embryo&#x27;s blood vessels and not other tissues.

Sabin graduated from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1900.

== Professional life ==

=== Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (1902-1925) ===
Upon graduation, Sabin obtained an internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital under physician Sir William Osler. Following a one-year internship with Osler, she won a research fellowship in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where she continued to work with Mall. Shortly thereafter, a Fellowship in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins was created for her.

In 1902 she began to teach in the Department of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins. By 1905 she was promoted to associate professor and finally appointed professor of embryology and histology in June 1917, the first woman to become a full professor at a medical college.

She continued her research on the origins of blood, blood vessels, blood cells, the histology of the brain, and the pathology and immunology of tuberculosis at Hopkins. In 1924, Sabin&#x27;s work on the origins of blood vessels earned her presidency of the American Association of Anatomists.

In 1925, Sabin left Johns Hopkins after completing her research amidst institutional discrimination and her desire to research full time.

=== Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1925-1938) ===
In September 1925 she became head of the department of cellular studies at Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. Her research focused on the lymphatic system, blood vessels and cells, and tuberculosis.

In 1925, she was voted into the National Academy of Sciences. She was the first woman to gain membership in this prestigious body and would remain the lone female member for the next 20 years.

In 1926, she joined the research committee of the National Tuberculosis Association. The committee&#x27;s purpose was to consolidate all of the tuberculosis research taking place with the hope of controlling the disease proactively. While here, Sabin devoted her research to immune cells, monocytes in particular, which developed into other cells. Sabin spent her final years at the institute determining the effects imposed by foreign substances and their consequent formation of antibodies.

In 1938, Sabin left her position at Rockefeller Institute and moved back to Colorado for retirement.

==Final years &amp; legacy==
After six years of quiet retirement, Sabin accepted Colorado Governor John Vivian&#x27;s request to chair a subcommittee on health beginning in 1944. She presented her findings asserting that the state was “backward in regard to public health” in a letter to the Governor in April 1945. Knowing that health care legislation had been voted down consistently in the past due to uninterested politicians, she was relentless in her demand for reform.

While she was in her early seventies, Sabin refused to let a snowstorm prevent her from making it to a speech in support of her cause despite public travel concerns. Beginning with this speech, Sabin worked to have politicians who opposed health reform defeated by those in support of it. These efforts resulted in the passing of a set of laws in her name. The “Sabin Health Laws” modernized public health in Colorado by providing more hospital beds to treat tuberculosis, resulting in significant reductions in cases.

In an address to the Illinois Statewide Health Committee in 1947, Sabin said that she was chosen as committee chair because the Governor had no interest in public health and appointed “an old lady” because he did not think she would be able to accomplish anything. In 1948 she became manager of health and charities for Denver, donating her salary over the next three years to medical research.

In 1951 Sabin retired for a second and final time, continuing to advocate for public health issues. Sabin&#x27;s lifetime of service resulted in the building housing University of Colorado’s department of medicine being named the Florence R. Sabin Building for Research in Cellular Biology. Sabin died of a heart attack on October 3, 1953 (she was 81). She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the Fairmount Mausoleum at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver, Colorado.

In 1959, the state of Colorado donated a statue of Sabin to the National Statuary Hall Collection. In 1973, Sabin was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, In 1985, Sabin was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2005, Johns Hopkins University honored Sabin&#x27;s legacy by naming one of the four colleges of its medical school after her.

==Research projects and papers==
In the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes Archives, Sabin&#x27;s collection of papers and medical records from 1903 - 1941 are stored and some even released upon request. The Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College holds many of Dr. Sabin&#x27;s papers. Other collections are located in the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia, the medical school of the University of Colorado, Colorado State Historical Society&#x27;s Division of Museums, Rockefeller Institute, and in the Alan Mason Chesney Papers at Johns Hopkins University.

<doc id="701894" wikidata="Q898039" url="?curid=701894" title="Drax the Destroyer">
<text>Drax the Destroyer (Arthur Sampson Douglas) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; #55 (February 1973).

The character&#x27;s origin story relates that Arthur Douglas was a human whose family was attacked and killed by the supervillain Thanos. Needing a champion to combat Thanos, the being known as Kronos took Arthur&#x27;s spirit and placed it in a powerful new body, and Drax the Destroyer was born. Drax&#x27;s powers included enhanced strength and resilience, flight, and the ability to project energy blasts from his hands. The character often battled Thanos, and on occasion the superheroes Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock. He was also a member of the group known as the Infinity Watch.

In 2004, the character lost his flight and energy blasts, and a portion of his strength and resilience. This version of the character played a role in the crossover comic book storylines &quot;Annihilation&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and became a member of the relaunched Guardians of the Galaxy.

Drax has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, action figures, and video games. Dave Bautista portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;&quot; (2022), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy: Holiday Special&quot; (2022 television film) and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023). Drax also appears in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021).

==Creation==
Starlin commented on the character&#x27;s creation stating &quot;In the beginning, Drax was versatile, because I didn&#x27;t know what the hell to do with him,&quot; Starlin confessed. &quot;He was an element; he was supposed to be Thanos&#x27; Kryptonite. I sort of drifted away from that idea, and when I came back to using him, I made a big change in him. I brain-damaged him and made him into the Hulk, because Marvel didn&#x27;t have a dumb green thing at the time, and I thought they should. And so I sort of made him like that. Later on they wanted to change his visuals, which I had no problem with because I was never crazy about that costume. It didn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. I wasn&#x27;t invested enough in the character to go back and do anything more with it.&quot;

Starlin later commented in an interview that &quot;I ripped off my own costume, I redesigned Dr. Weird&#x27;s costume at Texas Trio and pretty much just used it as Drax&#x27;s costume, Drax was going to be Thanos&#x27;s kryptonite that&#x27;s why he was green.&quot;

==Publication history==
Drax first appeared in &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; #55 (February 1973), and was created by Jim Starlin with the help of writer Mike Friedrich. He had a recurring role in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, beginning with issue #27 (July 1973). He also appeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; #10 (December 1975), &quot;Iron Man&quot; #88 (July 1976), &quot;Warlock&quot; #15 (November 1976), &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; #6 (June 1977), &quot;Thor&quot; #314 (December 1981), and &quot;Avengers&quot; #219 (May 1982), before being killed by Moondragon in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #220 (June 1982).

Starlin resurrected Drax in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 #35 (1990), and he had a recurring role until issue 50. After appearing in &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (1991), he was featured in &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #1–42 (1992–1995) as a member of the titular team, the Infinity Watch. The character reappeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 3 #1–4 (1998–1999) and &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; vol. 4 #4–6 (2001).

Drax received an eponymous 4 issue miniseries in 2004, and was a starring character in &quot;Annihilation: Nova&quot; #1–4 (2005) and &quot;Annihilation&quot; #1–6 (2006). After a follow-up appearance in &quot;Nova&quot; vol. 4 #4–7 (2007) and the 2008 &quot;&quot; storyline, he was featured as a team member in the 2008 relaunch of Guardians of the Galaxy, and appeared in the 25 issue series of the same name. The character had a small role in &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; #1–3 (2010), in which he was killed.

The character reappeared in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; issues #4–8 (June–October 2012), with no reference to his death. He then starred in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 3, a part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch.

==Fictional character biography==

===Creation and early life===
While driving through a desert with his wife and daughter, Arthur Douglas&#x27; car is attacked by a spaceship piloted by Thanos, who thinks the humans have seen him. His daughter, Heather, survives the crash and is adopted by Thanos&#x27; father, Mentor, and raised on Titan. She later becomes Moondragon.
Needing a champion to combat the threat from Thanos, Mentor and his father Kronos capture Douglas&#x27; spirit and place it in a powerful new body. He is rechristened &quot;Drax the Destroyer&quot;, and his sole purpose is to kill Thanos. With Iron Man, Drax battles Thanos and the Blood Brothers, but Thanos escapes. While trying to prevent Thanos from getting the Cosmic Cube, Drax&#x27;s memories are restored to him. After seeing Captain Marvel defeat Thanos, Drax attacks Captain Marvel for robbing him of his purpose. Drax wanders space in grim contemplation, searching for a resurrected Thanos. By the time he learns that Thanos had managed to rematerialize himself, Thanos has once again been destroyed in battle with Captain Marvel, the Avengers, and Adam Warlock. Alongside Captain Marvel, Drax battles ISAAC, Stellarax, Lord Gaea, Elysius, and Chaos.

Some time later, Drax, possessed by an alien entity, battles his daughter Moondragon and the superhero Thor. After Drax recovers, he and Moondragon journey through space in search of knowledge. Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba-Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world&#x27;s goddess. Drax recognizes that her ambitions are ignoble and so sends their ship to Earth with a holographic distress message. The Avengers respond and discover Moondragon&#x27;s world of mentally enforced tranquility. Freed by the Avengers from his daughter&#x27;s mental domination, Drax advances toward her, seeking to end her menace. To stop him, Moondragon mentally forces Drax&#x27;s life essence to vacate his artificial body.

===Infinity Watch===

When Thanos is resurrected by Mistress Death, Kronos reanimates the Destroyer and grants him increased physical power. However, Kronos does not consider the effects of Drax&#x27;s death, and the Destroyer&#x27;s mind retains the damage done by Moondragon. Alongside a multitude of other heroes, Drax helps battle Thanos and Nebula for possession of the Infinity Gauntlet. Drax is chosen by Adam Warlock to safeguard the Power Gem as part of the Infinity Watch.

After the energy vampire Rune steals the gems, the Watch members go their separate ways. Drax returns to Titan with Moondragon, who successfully petitions Kronos to restore Drax&#x27;s mind to its former acuity at the cost of some physical power. Thus, Drax is restored to his original condition. Drax is accused of the murder of Elysius and several others, but is cleared when it is discovered that the creature Syphon was manipulating him. While seeking out Moondragon, Drax enters into an altercation with Genis-Vell. In the course of this struggle, Drax is transported to the Microverse with Genis, where, for a time, he finds acceptance and happiness on the planet K&#x27;ai.

===Reborn===

Later, Drax is seen on a prison transport ship with Paibok, Lunatik, and the Blood Brothers. The ship crashes in Alaska, and Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives. He mistakes a young girl named Cammi for his daughter, and tries to protect her from Paibok. Drax appears to be killed, but a slimmer, smarter Drax emerges from the larger shell of the dead body. When a second prison ship arrives to recapture the prisoners, both Drax and Cammi are arrested.

Surviving Annihilus&#x27; attack on the intergalactic prison known as the Kyln, Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian Nova Corps, Richard Rider. Together they fight against the advancing Annihilation Wave as Drax trains Nova to be a warrior. Drax learns that Thanos has taken Moondragon hostage, and that she will be killed if Drax pursues him. During a doomed battle between the Annihilation Wave and the United Front, Drax stays behind to fight off the invaders while Nova and the rest of the group (including Cammi) finish the evacuation. Drax fights his way to the Annihilation Wave&#x27;s mother ship, where he finds Thanos and kills him. Drax helps to free a captive Galactus, who teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave. Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just &quot;disappeared&quot;. Cammi is later seen, alive, allied with Skreet, one of Thanos&#x27; powerful, miniature assistants.

When the Phalanx invade the Kree home-world, Drax is assimilated as a &quot;select&quot; of the Phalanx hive mind. They dispatch him, along with Gamora, to apprehend Nova, who had fled the planet. Following Nova to Kvch, the home planet the Technarchy (parental race of the Phalanx), Drax and Gamora are freed from the Phalanx by the Technarch Tyro. Together they return to Hala where they help in the defeat of Ultron.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===

Star-Lord recruits Drax for the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The Guardians are forced to ally themselves with a resurrected Thanos and travel into an alternate reality known as the &quot;Cancerverse&quot;. While experiencing a bout of madness, Drax attacks Thanos and is killed. Drax later reappears with the Guardians on Earth without reference to his death.

==Powers and abilities==
Drax&#x27;s initial incarnation&#x27;s powers included superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury as well the ability to project concussive blasts of cosmic energy from his hands. He could also travel at high speeds in outer space and hyperspace without air, food, or water. Drax also had telepathy, having used it to engage Thanos in a psychic battle and stalemating him mind to mind.

After his resurrection, his physical capabilities are greatly enhanced beyond their original levels but he suffered severe mental disability in his new incarnation. Instead of his telepathy which enabled him to track Thanos across vast distances, he now possessed the ability to sense either him or other beings who have been in recent contact with Thanos, alongside a precognitive ability to sense when beings will be in contact with Thanos in the near future. For a time, Drax possessed the Power Gem that had the potential to grant him superhuman physical and energy manipulation powers with no feasible limit. However, because of his severely-reduced intellect, he lacked the mental capacity and imagination to use the gem for anything other than bolstering his physical strength. While possessing the gem, Drax&#x27;s strength has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the Hulk, but lacking the latter&#x27;s rage-fueled potential.

Just prior to the 2006 &quot;Annihilation&quot; mini-series and continuing through the present, Drax undergoes a physical change, resulting in a much-smaller physical form, reduced physical abilities comparable to those of his original form, and the loss of his energy projection, flight and most of his psionic abilities. However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle. At least temporarily, he had the ability to pass through Thanos&#x27;s force field; his power levels seem to increase the closer he is to Thanos. He could also heal at an accelerated rate and had senses sharp enough to tell humans from aliens by smell, root out a Skrull in disguise, and detect when energy weapons were about to go off.

<text>Moondragon (Heather Douglas) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Bill Everett, Mike Friedrich, and George Tuska, the character first appeared in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #54 (January 1973). She has achieved her extraordinary talents strictly through extreme degrees of personal regimen, unlike most Marvel Comics characters who have gained their paranormal abilities through birth or accident. She is one of the most powerful telepaths on Earth. Her abilities also include telekinesis and the power to transform into a dragon.

==Publication history==
Moondragon debuted in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #54 (January 1973), created by Bill Everett, Mike Friedrich, and George Tuska. She appeared in the 2007 &quot;&quot; series, the 2019 &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; series, and the 2020 &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; series, by writer Al Ewing.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===

Heather Douglas was born in Los Angeles, California, daughter of Arthur and Yvette Steckley Douglas. When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of Thanos land; the space villain did not want any witnesses, so he destroyed their car. Heather was thrown clear and survived, but her parents were killed. She would later discover that her father&#x27;s soul was bound into a new body, becoming Drax the Destroyer. She was found by Thanos&#x27; father, Mentor, who took her to his home world, Titan, to be raised by the monks of Shao-Lom.

From the monks, Heather develops her body to its full potential, becoming a formidable martial artist. They teach Heather scientific disciplines such as chemistry and genetic engineering; but most significantly, they help Heather tap into the latent psionic powers present within all humans. Heather is able to develop her mental powers far beyond those of her teachers, so much so that she eventually mentally contacts a powerful entity called the Dragon of the Moon. The Dragon immediately tries to corrupt and take her over, but she fights back, driving the Dragon away. This fills her with pride and an overwhelming sense of superiority. To commemorate her victory, she takes the name Moondragon. Unknown to Heather, the Dragon continues to influence her on a subconscious level.

Heather&#x27;s choice of the name Moondragon causes an uproar amongst the monks of Shao-Lom, so much so that Mentor has to confront her on the matter. After the confrontation, Moondragon is approached by Runner, one of the Elders of the Universe. Runner takes Moondragon on a tour of the universe, showing her its fantastic sights and wonders. Runner eventually takes Moondragon to the surface of a sun. He informs her that the sun would go nova in several years. Moondragon points out to Runner that the sun harbored an inhabited planet and that they should warn the inhabitants. Runner regretfully responds that, when he chose the path of freedom, he lost the option to interfere with others&#x27; destinies. Moondragon argues, &quot;What good is freedom?&quot; when it only leads to death. When Runner fails to answer her satisfactorily, she requests to be brought back home.

Sometime later, Thanos attacks Titan, destroying the monastery and the Shao-Lom monks. Moondragon escapes in her spaceship and flees to Earth.

===Alliances against Thanos and Korvac===

She first returns to Earth under the guise of &quot;Madame MacEvil&quot; to develop a means to combat Thanos. This leads to the creation of villains like Angar the Screamer, Ramrod, and the Dark Messiah. In her first appearance, she forces Iron Man to battle Namor in order to study them. She then reveals her true identity and helps the Avengers in their first confrontation with Thanos. 
She battles Daredevil but is nearly killed by her ex-ally Kerwin J. Broderick. She restores Daredevil&#x27;s sight briefly with her alien pressure point skills and then first meets Mar-Vell. She aids them against Angar, the Dark Messiah, and Terrex. She falls in love with Daredevil but then returns to outer space. She aids Captain Mar-Vell, Drax, and the Avengers against Thanos.

Moondragon is one of the three candidates to be the &quot;Celestial Madonna&quot;, who was prophesied to give birth to a universal savior, but she loses to Mantis. She then becomes an adventurer and joins the Avengers. Her time with the team is short, ending when she meets the heroine Hellcat and takes her to Titan to train her. The following year Moondragon returns to help the Avengers battle Thanos.

When the Avengers confront Korvac, Moondragon’s powers allow her to see into his mind, and she decides that his goal of saving the universe by ruling it is noble. She stays out of the battle until Korvac, dejected, commits suicide.

===Paths of corruption and redemption===
Moondragon leaves Earth with Drax and finds a planet immersed in war, so she decides to take mental control of all its inhabitants to force them to live in peace, setting herself up as their &quot;peace goddess.” Drax summons the Avengers to intervene and in the resultant confrontation, Moondragon is forced to kill her father with her mental powers. Afterward, Thor takes her before a real god — his father, Odin — to be judged. Odin perceives within Moondragon a stalwart but tainted spirit. He condemns her to wear a magical headband that reduces her mental powers until she has overcome her arrogance and learned humility. He also assigns Valkyrie to be her guardian.

When Valkyrie rejoins the Defenders, Moondragon is forced to come along. At first, she sends out low level telepathic signals, luring threats to the vicinity of the Defenders&#x27; headquarters, hoping that one of these threats would remove her headband or force the Defenders to remove the headband so she may use her powers to aid them unhindered.

Despite the fact that Moondragon resents being with the Defenders, she wants to be accepted by them as a good person. In an encounter with Asgardian trolls, Moondragon resists the temptation of letting the trolls and the Dragon of the Moon remove her headband, thus proving herself to Odin, who promptly lets the headband fall off.

This personal victory is short-lived, for soon afterwards the Defenders have to fight the spawns of the mutated spores they fought months before. The spawns soon coalesce into a single gargantuan monster, which Moondragon vanquishes with the help of the Gargoyle. Unknown to Moondragon, in doing so, she is infected with the mutated spores. She does not find out about the infection until weeks later, when the spores have supplanted a good portion of her own internal organs. The Dragon of the Moon appears again and tells her it can save her life, but only if she agrees to be its host. Moondragon initially turns down its offer, knowing that it will use her to kill the Defenders. The Dragon then mocks Moondragon&#x27;s sentimentality by showing her what the other Defenders are saying about her behind her back even though she has reformed. Finally overwhelmed with pain, she accepts. Now totally corrupted, Moondragon battles the Defenders until Andromeda, Interloper, Manslaughter, and Valkyrie sacrifice themselves to kill both her and the Dragon.

Heather&#x27;s soul manages to survive, and, now free from the Dragon again, contacts her cousin Pamela; through her, she is able to obtain a new body for herself, a clone created on Titan. For a while, she and her cousin, who becomes the heroine Sundragon, adventure together in space.

===Cosmic cohort===

After Quasar is appointed Protector of the Universe, Moondragon insinuates herself into his life. Using the pseudonym H.D. Steckley she becomes an engineer and saleswoman for Vaughn Security Systems. She is convinced that in time Quasar will realize they are eminently qualified to form the universe&#x27;s most cosmic coupling. Quasar, however, asserts that qualifications have nothing to do with feelings and rebuffs her. She persists for a time, but eventually gets the message and loses interest.

When Adam Warlock seeks people to help him safeguard the Infinity Gems, he chooses Moondragon to keep the Mind Gem—but only after erecting safeguards so Moondragon cannot exploit the gem&#x27;s full power. Still, she agrees to join his team, the Infinity Watch. She eventually loses the gem when it is stolen by Rune.

Moondragon later becomes an associate of Genis-Vell (the third Captain Marvel), determined to help him control his cosmic awareness. During this time, she falls in love with Marlo Chandler, the wife of Rick Jones (whom Captain Marvel was bonded to). The two elope on a lesbian relationship to the reluctant understanding of Rick, with whom Marlo is having marital problems anyway. Sometime later, Marlo gets over her feelings for Moondragon and decides to return to Rick. Moondragon tells her she must have accidentally prodded her telepathically into the relationship, but this is a lie to make the break-up easier. In truth, Moondragon is heartbroken; she leaves shortly after with Phyla-Vell.

===Annihilation===

In the &quot;Annihilation&quot; miniseries, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell return, visiting the graves of Mar-Vell and Genis-Vell. At this time, Thanos appears and kidnaps Moondragon, using her as a hostage to draw out Drax the Destroyer for an unknown purpose. Also, when she is infected with the Annihilation Wave parasites, she is forced to reveal Annihilus&#x27; plan to destroy all life in the universe, which he would then rule. Thanos causes her to regurgitate the parasites, having no interest in Annihilus&#x27; plan. However, Thanos&#x27; plan for revenge is cut short as Drax rushes off to save his daughter, which he does by ripping Thanos&#x27; heart out, just before the villain was about to save the universe from Annihilus. However, Drax and Moondragon then manage to free the Silver Surfer, who in turn helps free Galactus, destroying Annihlus&#x27; plans. Galactus then teleports away Drax and Moondragon. Moondragon &quot;loses track&quot; of Drax and is reunited with Phyla-Vell.

===Annihilation: Conquest===

In &quot;Quasar: Annihilation: Conquest&quot;, the love of Phyla and Moondragon is explored in depth. Due to the Phalanx taking over the Kree Empire, Phyla and Heather have to find the &#x27;savior&#x27; that is shown to Phyla (Quasar) in a vision. They come across the Super-Adaptoid, who was absorbed by the Phalanx and set to prevent the women from finding the savior. During the battle, Moondragon has to change into a dragon, like the &#x27;Dragon of the Moon&#x27; she had to fight most of her life. Moondragon cannot change back into her human form. Moondragon and Phyla follow a voice Phyla hears to find the savior for the Kree race, who is being attacked by the Phalanx. In the end, it turns out the voice belongs to the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree. It helps them find a cocoon, which is restoring Adam Warlock. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx. Shortly after, the Phalanx arrives, led by Ultron. Moondragon attempts to protect Phyla, and Ultron responds by plunging his arm into her chest. Heather dies shortly after in Phyla&#x27;s arms.

Sometime later, Phyla and Drax are alerted by a prophet that Moondragon may be attempting to return. Mentor concludes that this may be the case, and so kills the two of them so that they may journey into the realm of the dead to retrieve her. Phyla saves Moondragon from the gullet of the Dragon of the Moon, and they return to life.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
After her resurrection, Moondragon joins Phyla back at Knowhere and is accepted as an unofficial member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. She assists Cosmo and Mantis as part of the telepathic support team. Her resurrection leaves her mind more open than it had been before her death, so she is able to detect things before either Mantis or Cosmo do. Her increased sensitivity also leaves her more vulnerable to psychic manipulation by Starhawk, who has herself been released from confinement.

With Phyla&#x27;s death at the hands of Adam Magus, Moondragon takes it upon herself to become a field agent for the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, she becomes host to an alien parasite originating in a parallel universe across the Fault, a time-space tear created by Black Bolt&#x27;s Terrigen Bomb. Worse, she is biometrically cuffed by Cynosure, leader of the Luminals (an organization of heroic alien superhumans from the planet Xarth III), who intends to have the creature tried for killing one of her fellow Luminals. To make things worse, members of the Universal Church of Truth kidnap Moondragon and Cynosure, seeing the parasite as a god, whom they intend to birth. The Guardians and Luminals mount a joint rescue attempt and extract the two. With the help of Knowhere&#x27;s medical staff, they are able to remove the organism from Moondragon. During these experiences, Moondragon has visions of a cocoon and Phyla being alive.

==Powers and abilities==
Heather Douglas is a human who has accessed her full psionic potential through extreme training under the Titanian monks of Shao-Lom. She is also highly educated in Titanian science and is a master martial artist.

Moondragon primarily possesses tremendous telepathic abilities, which have enabled her to control the population of an entire planet to stop an ongoing war, while enslaving the thunder god Thor as her personal lover. She has demonstrated willpower and spiritual strength rivaling that of Thanos, and the Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, pierced the psionic shields of the cosmic entity Galactus to enable communication, and when borrowing her abilities, Thanos almost manages to overwhelm the Devourer. Beyond communication and control of other minds, she can induce mental illusions, cause personality changes, and erase specific memories. She can also fire bolts of psionic energy as concussive blasts that can either stun an opponent or render an opponent brain dead. She is also a low-level telekinetic, an ability that lets her move and manipulate most physical matter by using only her thoughts, levitate herself and others, create shields of psychic force, and fire concussive psychokinetic energy blasts with sufficient strength to affect steel. She has demonstrated the ability to assume the form of her namesake, a fire-breathing dragon capable of surviving in outer space, traversing interstellar distances.

Moondragon has undergone extreme levels of training in the Titanian martial arts, as well as mental disciplines allowing her near-complete control over her body, including autonomic functions such as heartbeat, bleeding, and breathing, as well as awareness of pain. She has honed her strength, speed, stamina, agility and reflexes to her highest limits. Her martial arts skills have even allowed her to beat Captain America and Mantis in hand-to-hand combat. She possesses a genius intellect and is extremely knowledgeable in various areas of advanced Titanian scientific disciplines, such as genetics and bionics, and has been able to upgrade the cyborgs Ramrod and Angar the Screamer. She restored Daredevil&#x27;s eyesight. Additionally, she is also a highly skilled starship pilot.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
George Chrysostomou of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called Moondragon one of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;fan favorites,&quot; writing, &quot;Heather Douglas is a fascinating figure and it’s an absolute crime that she is yet to be introduced to the MCU.&quot; Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Moondragon a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Jasmine Shanelle of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; said they hoped to see Moondragon joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Mey Rude of &quot;Autostraddle&quot; stated Moondragon would be a &quot;perfect addition&quot; to the &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; film series. American actor Dave Bautista expressed interest in seeing Moondragon being portrayed in the MCU.

<text>Lawrence Elliott Willis (December 20, 1942 – September 29, 2019) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He performed in a wide range of styles, including jazz fusion, Afro-Cuban jazz, bebop, and avant-garde.

Willis was born in New York City. After his first year studying music theory at the Manhattan School of Music he began performing regularly with Jackie McLean. After he graduated he made his first jazz recording, McLean&#x27;s &quot;Right Now!&quot; in January 1965, which featured two of Willis&#x27; compositions. His first recording of any type, however, was as a singer with the Music and Arts Chorale Ensemble, performing an opera by Aaron Copland under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He decided to concentrate on jazz because of the difficulties African-American musicians had in finding work in concert music.

Throughout his career he performed with a wide range of musicians, including several years as keyboardist for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (beginning in 1972). He spent several years as pianist for trumpeters Nat Adderley and Woody Shaw as well as long and productive tenures with Roy Hargrove and with Jerry Gonzalez and his Fort Apache Band. His late recording with Paul Murphy, &quot;Exposé&quot;, demonstrated the fusion principles of bebop and avant-garde jazz. His composition &quot;Sanctuary&quot; began exploring works employing strings. After a successful performance in Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Annie Pfieffer Chapel at Florida Southern College&#x27;s Child of the Sun Jazz Festival he was commissioned to write a full-scale orchestral work for jazz trio and orchestra. He worked with Hugh Masekela on a South African Suite of music and interpreted Miles Davis&#x27; work. He was in the Round About Midnight tour of Miles Davis&#x27; music. He received the Don Redman award in 2011, and the Benny Golson Jazz Master Award at Howard University in 2012.

He died of an aneurysm in Baltimore at the age of 76.

<doc id="701907" wikidata="Q684695" url="?curid=701907" title="That's My Bush!">
<text>That&#x27;s My Bush! is an American television sitcom that aired on Comedy Central from April 4 to May 23, 2001. The show was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, a comedy-duo best known for creating &quot;South Park&quot;.

Despite the political overtones, the show itself was more a broad lampoon of American sitcoms, including jokes, a laugh track, and stock characters such as klutzy secretary Princess (Kristen Miller), know-it-all maid Maggie (Marcia Wallace), and supposedly helpful next door neighbor Larry (John D&#x27;Aquino).

The series was conceived in the wake of the 2000 presidential election, between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Parker and Stone were sure that Gore would win the election, and tentatively titled the show &quot;Everybody Loves Al&quot;. However, due to the controversy regarding the election&#x27;s outcome, the series was pushed back. Instead, the show was then plotted around Bush at the workplace.

The show received positive reviews from critics, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting, &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; is a satire of hero worship itself; it is the anti-&quot;West Wing&quot; and the first true post-Clinton comedy. [...] This politically astute criticism is embedded in so much hysterical humor that the series never seems weighty.&quot;

==Plot==
The series centers on the fictitious personal life of President George W. Bush, played by Timothy Bottoms. Carrie Quinn Dolin played Laura Bush, and Kurt Fuller played Karl Rove.

Episodes dealt (with deliberate heavy-handedness) with the topics of abortion, gun control, the war on drugs, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the death penalty. Every episode ended with George saying &quot;One of these days, Laura, I&#x27;m gonna punch you in the face!&quot;, a parody of Jackie Gleason&#x27;s line from &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, &quot;One of these days, POW!!! Right in the kisser!&quot;

The show was more of a spoof of the banality of television sitcoms in general, rather than a cutting political satire. As &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; put it:
==Cast==
* Timothy Bottoms as President George W. Bush
* Carrie Quinn Dolin as First Lady Laura Bush
* Kurt Fuller as Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove
* Marcia Wallace as Maggie Hawley
* Kristen Miller as Princess Stevenson
* John D&#x27;Aquino as Larry O&#x27;Shea

==Production==
===Development===
Parker and Stone stated before the 2000 presidential election that they would create a satire about whoever won. According to their DVD commentary, they were &quot;95% certain that Gore would win&quot; and began developing the series under the title &quot;Everybody Loves Al&quot;. When the final election results were in limbo, production was delayed until the winner was determined. With Bush&#x27;s election, the title became the entendre &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; The final episode involves Dick Cheney forcing Bush to step down, and featured an alternate title music called &quot;That&#x27;s My Dick!&quot; which, later in the episode, changed to &quot;What a Dick!&quot;

The show was pitched to HBO, Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, FX and MTV, who all turned down the series.

===Writing===
The entire idea behind the series was to parody sitcoms. The premise developed into one of the U.S. President in office. Parker recalled the idea came about three months before the 2000 presidential election. The duo were &quot;95 percent sure&quot; that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win, and tentatively titled the show &quot;Everybody Loves Al&quot;. It was, essentially, the same show: a lovable main character, the sassy maid, the wacky neighbor. Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms. The duo watched a lot of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; in preparation.

The duo signed a deal with Comedy Central to produce a live-action sitcom, titled &quot;Family First&quot;, scheduled to debut on February 28, 2001. They threw a party the night of the election with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of who the President would be, the show&#x27;s production was pushed back. The duo wanted to write a &quot;family sitcom&quot;, with the Bush family.

Comedy Central, however, prohibited Parker and Stone from including the Bush twins (Jenna Bush and Barbara Pierce Bush). The writers then turned the Bush twins character into Princess. &quot;An Aborted Dinner Date&quot; was the show&#x27;s pilot episode. The episode features Felix the Fetus, made and operated by the Chiodo Brothers, who later worked with Parker and Stone on &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; (2004). They also created the cat Punk&#x27;kin in &quot;The First Lady&#x27;s Persqueeter&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers consider the second episode aired, &quot;A Poorly Executed Plan&quot;, the &quot;true&quot; first episode.

This was Parker and Stone&#x27;s first live-action production in association with the Writers Guild of America, West. The show&#x27;s writers got a big dry-erase board and on one side, they would write down political ideas (abortion, capital punishment) and on the other side would be typical sitcom stories (frat buddies show up, trapped in a small space). They would then combine the two ideas, in what Stone described as &quot;a &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; mix-up kind of thing.&quot;

===Pre-production===
&quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot. It was not shot in front of a live audience, so as to maintain control and by necessity, thanks to various shots they would be unable to do in a normal show. They had built several rooms from the White House in their studio (bedroom, dining room) and were allowed &quot;one new, rotating set&quot; per week.

Parker described the sets as &quot;amazing,&quot; and they were in fact packaged up after the show&#x27;s run and sent to other White House-related productions. The show&#x27;s producers gained inspiration by going on a private tour of the White House thanks to Anne Garefino, executive producer, who once worked at the White House for PBS. A White House usher showed the producers various rooms not allowed on normal tours, which allowed them to detail each set effectively.

===Casting===
Casting was relatively simple; Parker and Stone came across a photo of Timothy Bottoms in &quot;Variety&quot; for a play he was doing in Santa Barbara. Parker and Stone called him in, and they found he was &quot;perfect&quot; for the role. The plan was not to viciously &quot;rip on&quot; Bush or make him out to be a monster; in accordance with sitcom stereotypes, Bush was made a sweet and lovable oaf. Kurt Fuller was the last to be cast. Jeff Melman directed all eight episodes. This was the first time Parker was only writing, not directing.

===Filming===
Each episode was shot in two days. The weeks were spent in writing and pre-production while the cast rehearsed. Like &quot;South Park&quot;, in which Parker would be able to write a scene and see it animated a short time later, he and Stone could walk to rehearsals and see the cast rehearsing their script. Each episode commenced with a cold open, with a &quot;cheesy&quot; joke that segued into the theme song. The duo recalled that, with stupid titles, these scenes were often the hardest to write.

The episode &quot;SDI-Aye-AYE!&quot; features the first utterance of the word &quot;Lemmiwinks&quot;, which Parker and the writers intended to be a parody of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The word was later famously used in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The Death Camp of Tolerance&quot;. The show&#x27;s first episode set a Comedy Central ratings record (at the time) for highest debut with over 2.9 million viewers tuning in; however, ratings dropped after this, with an average of 1.7 million viewers.

During the production of &quot;Fare Thee Welfare&quot;, the series finale, producers knew the end was near as it would be very expensive. For example, for the episode &quot;Eenie Meenie Miney Murder&quot;, Parker and Stone used a live bear, an animatronic bear, an actor in a bear suit, and a puppet bear, which ended up breaking their budget. Although the show received a fair amount of publicity and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the budget was too high, &quot;about $1 million an episode.&quot;

==Cancellation==
Comedy Central officially axed the series in August 2001, as a cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying &quot;A super-expensive show on a small cable network...the economics of it were just not going to work.&quot; The series continued via reruns, considering it a creative and critical success. Parker believed the show would not have survived after the September 11 attacks anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not &quot;play well.&quot; There was talk of a spin-off feature film for the series entitled &quot;George W. Bush and the Secret of the Glass Tiger&quot;. The concept extended the series&#x27; bait and switch gag: it would have to do with a Chinese invasion foiled by the President. Parker and Stone intended to develop it during the summer of 2002.

===Retrospective===
Parker recalls &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; &quot;a great time in our lives,&quot; and &quot;the most fun we&#x27;ve had in our careers.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot; has had an effect on the structure of &quot;South Park&quot;: prior to 2001, each &quot;South Park&quot; episode was broken up into four acts. While producing &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;, Parker and Stone found the three act structure provided a better story, and &quot;South Park&quot; has continued to use it in recent years. Stone called the show one of the most pleasant experiences in his life.

Bottoms went on to portray George W. Bush in two later films: in a comedic context in &quot;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&quot;, and in a serious context in the television film &quot;DC 9/11: Time of Crisis&quot;.

<text>Mordecai Bartley (December 16, 1783 – October 10, 1870) was a Whig politician from northeastern Ohio. He served as the 18th governor of Ohio. Bartley succeeded his son, Thomas W. Bartley as governor, one of few instances of this happening in the United States in high offices.

==Biography==
Bartley was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. After attending the local school in Virginia, he married Elizabeth Welles in 1804 and moved to Jefferson County, Ohio.

Bartley served as a captain, and then an adjutant during the War of 1812. Following his service under General William Henry Harrison in the War, Bartley moved to Richland County, Ohio, near Mansfield.

While farming, he was elected and served one term in the Ohio State Senate from 1816 to 1818. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1822, Bartley served four terms before declining to be renominated in 1830.

Bartley was an Ohio Whig Party Presidential elector in 1836 for William Henry Harrison.

He ran for governor in 1844 as a Whig after David Spangler, the original nominee, declined to run. Bartley served a single term from 1844 to 1846 before retiring again. While he was Governor, Ohio raised forty companies and 7,000 men for the Mexican–American War.

<doc id="701912" wikidata="Q4703036" url="?curid=701912" title="Pip the Troll">
<text>Pip the Troll is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

He made his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Eternals&quot; (2021), voiced by Patton Oswalt.

==Publication history==
Pip the Troll was introduced by Jim Starlin in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 2 #179 (February 1975) to be a comic foil to the story&#x27;s protagonist, Adam Warlock. Pip returned in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 2 #180-181 (March–April 1975) and &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 1 #9-12 (October 1975-Jan 1976) before his death in &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #7 (March 1977).

Starlin revived the character years later in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 #46 (December 1990). Pip played a role in the 1991 &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; crossover before joining the titular team of &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; in issue two (March 1992). He appeared in the title until its cancellation in 1995 with issue 42. During its run, the character was also featured in the &quot;Infinity War&quot;, &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot;, and &quot;Blood and Thunder&quot; crossovers.

After a brief appearance in a back-up feature in &quot;Cosmic Powers Unlimited&quot; #4 (1996), the character was not seen again until 2002 when Starlin used him in &quot;Infinity Abyss&quot; #1-6. He returned in &quot;&quot; #5-6 (2003) and &quot;Thanos&quot; #3-4 (2004), &quot;She-Hulk&quot; #12-13 (2005), and &quot;X-Factor&quot; #207-213 (2010–2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Pip is originally known as Prince Gofern of the planet Laxidazia, in the Dolenz System, in the Milky Way galaxy. He is originally an alien of the Laxidazian race who was mutated into a satyr-like form known as a &quot;troll&quot; after drinking mutagenic ale. Like all Laxidazian trolls, Pip has four digits (including opposable thumb) on each hand, hooflike feet, and large pointed ears; apparently, normal Laxidazians are nearly identical to Earth humans. After his transformation, his people, also sick of his lewd, lecherous, and hedonistic behavior, strip him of his office and rank. He stows away on a spaceship and continues his life of debauchery. Pip begins his habit of dressing in a pair of maroon, ripped pants and nothing else.

Missionaries from the Universal Church of Truth visit Pip&#x27;s home planet and discover the trolls are resistant to the church&#x27;s conversion process. As a result, all trolls are ordered to be killed. Pip himself is caught after making trouble on dozens of planets, many controlled by the church. He ends up on a ship full of men and women who are to be executed. There he meets Adam Warlock, whose alternate future self the Magus will become the leader of the Church of Truth. Pip teams up with Warlock to escape and go on adventures. Pip then meets Gamora. Pip meets Thanos, and alongside Warlock, Gamora, and Thanos, he battles the Magus and the Universal Church. He encounters Starfox and Heater Delight, and battles Pro-Boscis the Procurer. Eventually the threat of the Magus is neutralized and Pip parts company with Adam on the world of Sirus X.

After getting into much more trouble, Pip decides to look for Adam again. Pip explores one of Thanos&#x27; old hideouts and discovers not Adam, but Thanos himself. Thanos destroys Pip&#x27;s mind, but Adam manages to absorb Pip&#x27;s soul into the Soul Gem (killing his mindless body, but restoring mental function to his soul), reuniting him with the spirits of Gamora and eventually Adam Warlock in Soulworld within the Soul Gem.

Pip resides in Soulworld for some time. While there, he accompanies the Silver Surfer and Captain Autolycus in search of Warlock. He witnesses a battle between Warlock and Drax the Destroyer.

===Infinity Watch===
Pip, Gamora, and Warlock return to the corporeal world during the Infinity Gauntlet incident by taking over bodies of three crash victims. Pip, in possession of the body of Ralph Bunker, and Gamora are both shown to have significantly increased physical strength in their new bodies. However, soon after returning to life, Gamora disappears. Alongside Warlock, Pip confers with Doctor Strange, Rintrah, Doctor Doom, and the Silver Surfer regarding Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet. Alongside Doctor Strange, Clea, and Rintrah, Pip battles Silver Dagger. Alongside Rintrah, Pip time-travels to Earth&#x27;s Jurassic era to rescue Firelord and Drax the Destroyer. Alongside Warlock and Gamora, Pip visits Thanos after his defeat. With Gamora, Pip summons Doctor Strange to deal with the seemingly power-mad Warlock, but is reconciled with Warlock.

Afterwards, Pip is given the Space Gem by Warlock, keeping it between his toes for safekeeping. Pip joins Warlock&#x27;s Infinity Watch. With the Infinity Watch, Pip is captured by the Man-Beast, but rescued by Warlock. Pip and his friends end up setting shop on Monster Island. Pip takes too much as usual and abuses the hospitality of Mole Man. In a dispute over the sovereignty of the island, forces of the United Nations invade. Pip and the others hang back as Gamora cleans house, killing no one. The group makes bets on the fight.

Around this time, the Infinity War happens. When Warlock has control of the Infinity Gauntlet, he forces out the good and evil sides of himself. The evil side returns as the Magus. Pip is drawn into the fight when Thanos recruits the Watch. As most of Earth&#x27;s heroes do not trust Thanos, Pip and his friends are forced to battle them as well. Eventually both sides work together to take down the Magus.

===Infinity Crusade===
Pip becomes involved in the Infinity Crusade. He manages to be a capable &#x27;leader&#x27; of the remnants of the Infinity Watch when various events take most of them away. Moondragon, for example, is brainwashed and taken by the Goddess, the &#x27;good&#x27; side of Adam Warlock. She is using a Cosmic Egg, the merging of several Cosmic Cubes, to implement her plans, which involve brainwashing dozens of superheroes. Left on Monster Island with Maxam and Drax the Destroyer, the three argue over who should lead. Pip decides to go outside the group for help and kidnaps Mister Fantastic. The leader of the Fantastic Four soon realizes what is going on and pitches in to help. This, and the kidnapping of other superheroes, brings everyone together, Pip included, at Avengers Mansion and actually spurs on the heroic efforts of the rest of the super-powered community. Pip is spurred to create a new, &#x27;super-heroic&#x27; costume, but fails to wash himself while changing. His body odor is so offensive the Hulk forcibly bathes him.

===After Infinity Watch===
Professor X proceeds to make telepathic contact with one of the Goddess&#x27; thralls, Pip&#x27;s former ally, Moondragon. Pip secretly touches Xavier and his powers make contact through the link, allowing him to know the location of the Goddess because Moondragon knows it.

Pip teleports to it, in the center of the Goddess&#x27; planet, a new form of Counter-Earth. By touching the Cosmic Egg, Pip gains access to its near-infinite powers. He turns the Goddess into salt. He manifests a throne and sits upon it, musing as to what to do with his newfound powers. He reflects on many plans for Earth, such as making super-powered beings wash his car and changing all the females, including the overweight and elderly, into shapely, twenty-something women. One of his goals is to gain revenge on the Hulk for forcibly bathing him; however, he realizes none of this will make him truly happy, and therefore decides on something that will: a simple birthday party thrown for him by his friends. Before he can implement this, he is subdued by the brainwashed guardian of the Egg, the female New Warriors member Silhouette. She had been hiding in a nearby container, for just this sort of situation.

Pip also appears in &quot;&quot; #5–6 and &quot;She-Hulk&quot; (2005 series) #12–13. Pip assists Thanos in his first quest after his experience in &quot;Marvel: The End&quot; in &quot;Thanos&quot; #1–6.

===X-Factor Investigations===
Pip is next seen when Hela, the Norse goddess of death, appears in disguise and hires X-Factor Investigations to find a missing pendant of Thor&#x27;s hammer. When Jamie Madrox and Banshee track it down and take it off of the neck of a drunken bar patron, he reverts to Pip the Troll. Without the pendant hiding him, Hela is able to track down Pip, whom she captures. This angers X-Factor leader Madrox, who feels responsible, and the team travels to Las Vegas and saves the troll with the help of Thor. Pip follows X-Factor back to New York and joins the team, serving as receptionist, out of gratitude for their actions; however, a mysterious phone call Pip receives reveals that Pip has other, as-yet-unknown reasons for joining the group.

A woman Pip previously helped later shoots him in the head after claiming that &quot;X-Factor will fall&quot;. The injury, however, is not fatal due to his non-human physique: Laxidazians&#x27;s brains are in their chest, next to the heart. While recovering from the gunshot, Pip&#x27;s mind borrows the body Monet St. Croix.

==Powers and abilities==
When in possession of the Space Gem, Pip could theoretically access virtually incalculable powers, but chose to use it merely for transportation and teleportation. The gem gave him the ability to teleport to places he knows of. This he often used for his own ends, stealing the Fantasticar and other objects. When forced into battle, he tends to appear directly above his adversary&#x27;s head, intending to deliver a powerful blow. He has since lost the Space Gem, but his long-term exposure to it has given him the innate ability to teleport.

<doc id="701916" wikidata="Q1370156" url="?curid=701916" title="Silly season">
<text>In the United Kingdom, silly season is a period in the summer months known for frivolous news stories in the mass media. The term was first attested in 1861, and listed in the second (1894) edition of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;. The 15th edition of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s&quot; defined the silly season as &quot;the part of the year when Parliament and the Law Courts are not sitting (about August and September)&quot;. In North America, the period is often referred to as the slow news season. 

In Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the silly season has come to refer to the Christmas/New Year festive period (which occurs during the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere).

==Origin==
The first attestation in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is an article titled &quot;The Silly Season&quot; in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; edition of 13 July 1861. The article is specifically about an alleged reduction in the quality of the editorial content of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper:

during the months of autumn [, w]hen Parliament is no longer sitting and the gay world is no longer gathered together in London, something very different is supposed to do for the remnant of the public from what is needed in the politer portions of the year. The &quot;Times&quot;″s great men have doubtless gone out of town, like other great men. ... The hands which at other times wield the pen for our instruction are now wielding the gun on a Scotch moor or the Alpenstock on a Swiss mountain. Work is left to feebler hands. ... In those months the great oracle becomes —what at other times it is not—simply silly. In spring and early summer, the &quot;Times&quot; is often violent, unfair, fallacious, inconsistent, intentionally unmeaning, even positively blundering, but it is very seldom merely silly. ... In the dead of autumn, when the second and third rate hands are on, we sink from nonsense written with a purpose to nonsense written because the writer must write either nonsense or nothing.

==Motivation==
Typically, the latter half of the summer is slow in terms of newsworthy events. Newspapers as their primary means of income rely on advertisements, which rely on readers seeing them, but historically newspaper readership drops off during this time. In the United Kingdom, Parliament takes its summer recess, so that parliamentary debates and Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, which generate much news coverage, do not happen. This period is also a summer school holiday, when many families with children choose to take holidays, and there is accordingly often a decline of business news, as many employers reduce their activity. With law courts not sitting, there is a lack of coverage of court cases. Similar recesses are typical of legislative bodies elsewhere. To retain (and attract) subscribers, newspapers would print attention-grabbing headlines and articles to boost sales, often to do with minor moral panics or child abductions. For example, the extensive British press coverage devoted to Operation Irma, a humanitarian airlift during the Siege of Sarajevo, was critiqued as a &quot;silly season&quot; tactic.

==Other names==

Other countries have comparable periods, for example the (&quot;summer [news]hole&quot;) in German-speaking Europe; French has (&quot;the dead season&quot; or &quot;the dull season&quot;) or (&quot;the conker tree season&quot;), and Swedish has (&quot;news drought&quot;).

In many languages, the name for the silly season references cucumbers (more precisely: gherkins or pickled cucumbers). in Dutch, Danish , Icelandic , Norwegian (a piece of news is called or , i.e., &quot;cucumber news&quot;), Czech (&quot;pickle season&quot;), Slovak , Polish , Hungarian , and Hebrew (, &quot;season of the cucumbers&quot;) all mean &quot;cucumber time&quot; or &quot;cucumber season&quot;. The corresponding term in German is and in Estonian (&quot;pickled cucumber season&quot;); the same term is also used in Croatian as and in Slovene as .

The term &quot;cucumber time&quot; was also used in England in the 1800s to denote the slow season for tailors.

A silly season news item is called in Sweden and in Finland, both literally meaning &quot;rotting-month story&quot;.

In Spain the term (&quot;summer snake&quot;) is often used, not for the season, but for the news items. The term is a reference to the Loch Ness Monster and similar creatures, who are reputed to get more headlines in summer.

==Sports==
Silly season also refers to periods outside traditional season-long competitive sporting competitions. In team sports such as association football and professional ice hockey, and leagues such as Formula One, NASCAR, the NBA, or the NFL, the final weeks of the season leading into off-time between one season and the next is filled with speculation regarding possible changes involving players, staff, and teams. Regardless of whether the speculation remains just that or indeed bears fruit, the moves and the discussions they generate help build interest in the leagues, their teams, and their upcoming seasons. For Major League Baseball, the term hot stove league describes that league&#x27;s off-season.

Silly season is also used in professional golf to describe tournaments that are not official PGA Tour or LPGA Tour events. Normally scheduled at or near the end of the calendar year, when PGA and LPGA tournaments are not usually scheduled, these events also employ formats of play not normally seen on those tours. The Shark Shootout and the Skins Game are two such examples of silly season events.

<doc id="701919" wikidata="Q1132896" url="?curid=701919" title="Yuko Aoki">
<text>(born on February 5, 1977, in Takahata, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan) is a former Japanese bikini model and singer.

==Career==
She first started modeling in 1995, and became a &quot;Visual Queen of the Year&quot; at Fuji TV for 1996. She was a frequent cover girl on Japanese bikini photo magazines in the late 1990s. She appeared in the advertising campaign for Suntory&#x27;s product.

Aoki stopped modeling in 1998, and officially retired from modeling in 2000 to focus on a music career.

In February 1998, Aoki held a healing music concert at Casals Hall, near Ochanomizu Station in Tokyo. In June 1999, she sought to raise money through her singing for the refugees in Kosovo. On December 16, 2002, Aoki revealed a chocolate covered statue of David Beckham in Tokyo to generate publicity. In 2003 she released an album titled &quot;Blue&quot; on the Universal Japan label. She is currently the lead vocalist for the band Icy Blue. She has been the cover model for (and subject of major articles in) nearly fifty issues of various magazines in Japan, including &quot;Weekly Playboy&quot;&#x27;s March 12, 1996 issue.

Aoki started appearing for professional wrestling promotion Hustle in 2005, acting primarily as an announcer. In February 2006, Yuko got in a storyline in which she would audition for a full-time job in Hustle, but general manager Hiroko Suzuki verbally attacked her and made her cry until Wataru Sakata came to her rescue. Aoki became Sakata&#x27;s valet, and helped him to win a match against Hiroko&#x27;s husband Kenzo Suzuki.

===Private life===
In 2010, she retired from the entertainment industry after getting married. After her retirement, while raising children, she worked at her parents&#x27; conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Yonezawa.

<text>Eternal Tears of Sorrow (commonly abbreviated to EToS) was a Finnish melodic death metal band formed in Pudasjärvi.

== Biography ==
The band was formed in 1994 by Jarmo Puolakanaho, Altti Veteläinen and Olli-Pekka Törrö, after various projects that featured people who became members of Eternal Tears of Sorrow. Andromeda, a first death/doom/thrash metal project, had been put on hold in late 1992 because the rehearsal place had burned down. They could not find a new rehearsal place in their hometown, so the three members started a new side-project (M.D.C.) and recorded a demo tape, &quot;Beyond the Fantasy&quot;, in autumn 1993.

In spring 1994, they recorded a new demo, &quot;The Seven Goddesses of Frost&quot;. Then the band decided to change their name to something they felt more appropriate opting for Eternal Tears of Sorrow. Between 1994 and 1996 the band had a couple of songs on some compilation CDs in Europe and Canada, and recorded their debut, &quot;Sinner&#x27;s Serenade&quot;. It took more than a year for the debut album to get released by X-Treme Records, a small underground label from Gothenburg in Sweden. After they recorded their second album, &quot;Vilda Mánnu&quot;, Spinefarm Records approached the band and soon they signed a deal with the label.

Their third album, &quot;Chaotic Beauty&quot; (on which the band had three new members since Olli-Pekka Törrö had left the band), led to a European tour with Nightwish and Sinergy. Their fourth album, &quot;A Virgin and a Whore&quot;, went to the Finnish Album Top 40 charts. After releasing four albums, the band announced they were taking a break just after the release of &quot;A Virgin and a Whore&quot;; however, they broke up in January 2003.

In February 2005, the band announced they were going to make a comeback. Their fifth album, &quot;Before the Bleeding Sun&quot;, was released in April 2006 (excluding releases in Russia and Japan that were released later). This album also went to the Finnish Album Top 40 charts, to No. 26. The band added two session members since Petri Sankala and Janne Tolsa were unavailable at that time.

In late 2008, the band announced that Jarmo Kylmänen (who had been part of the band&#x27;s song-writing team since 2005) had joined the band as an official member. Soon after that, their long-time drummer Petri Sankala left because of back pain. In early April 2009, it was reported that Risto Ruuth had left the band. They found a replacement, Mika Lammassaari, and started rehearsing for the postponed live shows originally planned for May.

The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Children of the Dark Waters&quot;, came out in May 2009 through Suomen Musiikki in Finland, Massacre Records in the rest of Europe, and Marquee/Avalon in Asia. A new single, &quot;Tears of Autumn Rain,&quot; was released in Finland and Japan as well as on the band&#x27;s MySpace page. The other track on the single was a re-recorded version of &quot;Vilda Mánnu&quot; from their second album. &quot;Children of the Dark Waters&quot; charted at No. 19 at the Finnish Album Top 40 charts.

The seventh album, &quot;Saivon Lapsi&quot;, was released in February 2013.

On 2 February 2025, the band had announced on their social media that they had disbanded.

<text>Thomas Welles Bartley (February 11, 1812 – June 20, 1885) was an American Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. He served as the 17th governor of Ohio. Bartley was succeeded in office by his father, Mordecai Bartley, one of only a few instances of this occurring in high elected office in the United States.

==Biography==
Bartley was born in Jefferson County, Ohio on February 11, 1812. As a child, he moved to Mansfield, Ohio with his family. Bartley attended Jefferson College and graduated in 1829. He studied law with Jacob Parker in Mansfield, Ohio, and studied law with Elijah Hayward in Washington, D.C.. Bartley was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began practice in Mansfield.

==Career==
Bartley served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1839 to 1841 and then in the Ohio State Senate from 1841 to 1845. He was elected Speaker of the Senate in 1843.

When Wilson Shannon resigned as governor on April 15, 1844, to take a diplomatic appointment as United States ambassador to Mexico, 
Bartley became Governor while concurrently remaining in the Senate. He served out the remainder of Shannon&#x27;s term until December 3. Bartley sought renomination under the Democratic Party, but lost at the state convention by a single vote - avoiding a contest against his father, who accepted the Whig nomination. Bartley later served a contentious term on the Ohio State Supreme Court from 1852 to 1859.

Bartley lived in Mansfield, Ohio, and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to practice law in 1863, and in 1867 to Washington, D.C., where he died in 1885. He was interred at Glenwood Cemetery.

==Family life==

On October 9, 1837, Bartley married his first wife, Julia Maria Larwill, in Wooster, Ohio. Bartley married his second wife, Susan D. Sherman (October 10, 1825– January 10, 1876), sister of John Sherman and General William Tecumseh Sherman, on November 7, 1848. Ellen McCoy, widow of one of General Sherman&#x27;s staff officers, was his third wife.

==Death==
Bartley was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="701930" wikidata="Q677746" url="?curid=701930" title="Eastern wolf">
<text>The eastern wolf (Canis lycaon or Canis lupus lycaon), also known as the timber wolf, Algonquin wolf and eastern timber wolf, is a canine of debated taxonomy native to the Great Lakes region and southeastern Canada. It is considered to be either a unique subspecies of gray wolf or red wolf or a separate species from both. Many studies have found the eastern wolf to be the product of ancient and recent genetic admixture between the gray wolf and the coyote, while other studies have found some or all populations of the eastern wolf, as well as coyotes, originally separated from a common ancestor with the wolf over 1 million years ago and that these populations of the eastern wolf may be the same species as or a closely related species to the red wolf (&quot;Canis lupus rufus&quot; or &quot;Canis rufus&quot;) of the Southeastern United States. Regardless of its status, it is regarded as unique and therefore worthy of conservation with Canada citing the population in eastern Canada (also known as the &quot;Algonquin wolf&quot;) as being the eastern wolf population subject to protection.

There are two forms, the larger being referred to as the Great Lakes wolf, which is generally found in Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southeastern Manitoba and northern Ontario, and the smaller being the Algonquin wolf, which inhabits eastern Canada, specifically central and eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, with some overlapping and mixing of the two types in the southern portions of northeastern and northwestern Ontario. The eastern wolf&#x27;s morphology is midway between that of the gray wolf and the coyote. The fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown color mixed with cinnamon. The nape, shoulder and tail region are a mix of black and gray, with the flanks and chest being rufous or creamy. It primarily preys on white-tailed deer, but may occasionally hunt moose and beavers.

In the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the eastern wolf as a gray wolf subspecies, which supports its earlier classification based on morphology in three studies. This taxonomic classification has since been debated, with proposals based on DNA analyses that includes a gray wolf ecotype, a gray wolf with genetic introgression from the coyote, a gray wolf/coyote hybrid, a gray wolf/red wolf hybrid, the same species as the red wolf, or a separate species (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;) closely related to the red wolf. Commencing in 2016, two studies using whole genome sequencing indicate that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of ancient and complex gray wolf and coyote mixing, with the Great Lakes wolf possessing 25% coyote ancestry and the Algonquin wolf possessing 40% coyote ancestry.

In the US, gray wolves including the timber wolf are protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, although the protections were removed at the federal level in 2021 before being reinstated in 2022. In Canada, the eastern wolf is listed as &quot;Canis lupus lycaon&quot; under the &quot;Species At Risk Act 2002, Schedule 1&quot; - List of Wildlife at Risk. In 2015, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada recognized the eastern wolf in central and eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec as &quot;Canis&quot; cf. &quot;lycaon&quot; (&quot;Canis&quot; species believed to be &quot;lycaon&quot;) and a threatened species worthy of conservation. The main threat to this wolf is human hunting and trapping outside of the protected areas, which leads to genetic introgression with the eastern coyote due to a lack of mates. Further human development immediately outside of the protected areas and the negative public perception of wolves are expected to inhibit any further expansion of their range. In 2016, the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario recognized the Algonquin wolf as a &quot;Canis sp.&quot; (&quot;Canis&quot; species) differentiated from the hybrid Great Lakes wolves which it found were the result of &quot;hybridization and backcrossing among Eastern Wolf (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;) (aka &quot;C. lupus lycaon&quot;), Gray Wolf (&quot;C. lupus&quot;), and Coyote (&quot;C. latrans&quot;)&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The first published name of a taxon belonging to the genus &quot;Canis&quot; from North America is &quot;Canis lycaon&quot;. It was published in 1775 by the German naturalist Johann Schreber, who had based it on the earlier description and illustration of one specimen that was thought to have been captured near Quebec. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of gray wolf by Edward Goldman.

In the third edition of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the eastern wolf as a gray wolf subspecies, which supports its earlier classification based on morphology in three studies. This taxonomic classification has since been debated.

In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists considered the eastern wolf as its own species (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;).

===Taxonomic debate===
When European settlers first arrived to North America, the coyote&#x27;s range was limited to the western half of the continent. They existed in the arid areas and across the open plains, including the prairie regions of the midwestern states. Early explorers found some in Indiana and Wisconsin. From the mid-1800s coyotes began expanding beyond their original range.

The taxonomic debate regarding North American wolves can be summarised as follows:
The evolutionary biologist Robert K. Wayne, whose team is involved in an ongoing scientific debate with the team led by Linda K. Rutledge, describes the difference between these two evolutionary models: &quot;In a way, it is all semantics. They call it a species, we call it an ecotype.&quot;

====Paleontological evidence====
Some of the earliest &quot;Canis&quot; specimens were discovered at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska, in strata dated 810,000 years old. The dental measurements of the specimens clearly match historical &quot;Canis lycaon&quot; specimens from Minnesota.

====Genetic evidence====
Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years.

In 1991, a study of the mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) sequences of wolves and coyotes from across North America found that the wolves of the Minnesota, Ontario and Quebec regions possessed coyote genotypes. The study proposes that dispersing male gray wolves were mating with coyote females in deforested areas bordering wolf territory. The distribution of coyote genotypes within wolves matched the phenotypic differences between these wolves found in an earlier study, with the larger Great Lakes wolf found in Minnesota, the smaller Algonquin (Provincial Park) type found in central Ontario, and the smallest and more coyote-like tweed wolf or eastern coyote type occupying sections of southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec.

In 2000, a study looked at red wolves and eastern wolves from both eastern Canada and Minnesota. The study agreed that these two wolves readily hybridize with the coyote. The study used 8 microsatellites (genetic markers taken from across the genome of a specimen). The phylogenetic tree produced from the genetic sequences showed a close relationship among the red wolves and the eastern wolves from Algonquin Park, southern Quebec, and Minnesota such that they all clustered together. These then clustered next closer with the coyote and away from the gray wolf. A further analysis using mDNA sequences indicated the presence of coyote in both of these two wolves, and that these two wolves had diverged from the coyote 150,000–300,000 years ago. No gray wolf sequences were detected in the samples. The study proposed that these findings are inconsistent with the two wolves being subspecies of the gray wolf, that red wolves and eastern wolves (eastern Canadian and Minnesota) evolved in North America after having diverged from the coyote, and therefore they are more likely to hybridize with coyotes.

In 2009, a study of eastern Canadian wolves – which was referred to as the &quot;Great Lakes&quot; wolf in this study – using microsatellites, mDNA, and the paternally-inherited yDNA markers found that the eastern Canadian wolf was a unique ecotype of the gray wolf that had undergone recent hybridization with other gray wolves and coyotes. It could find no evidence to support the findings of the earlier 2000 study regarding the eastern Canadian wolf. The study did not include the red wolf. This study was quickly rebutted on the grounds that it had misinterpreted the findings of earlier studies that it relied upon, nor did it provide a definition for a number of the terms that it used, such as &quot;ecotype&quot;.

In 2011, a study compared the genetic sequences of 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) taken from the genomes of canids from around the world. The comparison indicated that the red wolf was about 76% coyote and 24% gray wolf with hybridization having occurred 287–430 years ago. The eastern wolf – which was referred to as the &quot;Great Lakes&quot; wolf in this study – was 58% gray wolf and 42% coyote with hybridization having occurred 546–963 years ago. The study rejected the theory of a common ancestry for the red and eastern wolves. However the next year, a study reviewed a subset of the 2011 study&#x27;s Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and proposed that its methodology had skewed the results and that the eastern wolf is not a hybrid but a separate species. The 2012 study proposed that there are three true canis species in North America – the gray wolf, the western coyote, and red wolf/eastern wolf with the eastern wolf represented by the Algonquin wolf, with the Great Lakes wolf being a hydrid of the eastern wolf and the gray wolf, and the eastern coyote being a hybrid of the western coyote and the eastern (Algonquin) wolf.

Also in 2011, a scientific literature review was undertaken to help assess the taxonomy of North American wolves. One of the findings proposed was that the eastern wolf, whose range includes eastern Canada and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan plus Wisconsin and Minnesota is supported as a separate species by morphological and genetic data. Genetic data supports a close relationship between the eastern and red wolves, but not close enough to support these as one species. It was &quot;likely&quot; that these were the separate descendants of a common ancestor shared with coyotes. This review was published in 2012.

Another study of both mDNA and yDNA in wolves and coyotes by the same authors indicates that the eastern wolf is genetically divergent from the gray wolf and is a North American evolved species with a long-standing history. The study could not dismiss the possibility of the eastern wolf having evolved from an ancient hybridization of gray wolf and coyote in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene. Another study by the same authors found that eastern wolf mDNA genetic diversity had been lost after their culling in the early 1960s, leading to the invasion of coyotes into their territory and introgression of coyote mDNA.

In 2014, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was invited by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide an independent review of its proposed rule relating to gray wolves. The Center&#x27;s panel findings were that the proposed rule was heavily dependent upon the analysis contained in a scientific literature review conducted in 2011 (Chambers et al.), that this work was not universally accepted and that the issue was &quot;not settled&quot;, and that the rule does not represent the &quot;best available science&quot;. Also in 2014, an experiment to hybridize a captive western gray wolf and a captive western coyote was successful, and therefore possible. The study did not assess the likelihood of such hybridization in the wild.

In 2015, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada changed its designation of the eastern wolf from &quot;Canis lupus lycaon&quot; to &quot;Canis cf. lycaon&quot; (&quot;Canis&quot; species believed to be &quot;lycaon&quot;) and a species at risk.

Later that year, a study compared the DNA sequences using 127,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) of wolves and coyotes, but did not include red wolves and used Algonquin wolves as the representative eastern wolf, not wolves from the western Great Lakes states (usually referred to as Great Lakes wolves). The study indicated that Algonquin wolves were a distinct genomic cluster, even distinct from the Great Lakes states&#x27; wolves, which it found were actually hybrids of the gray wolf and the Algonquin wolf. The study&#x27;s results did not exclude a possibility that the Great Lakes states&#x27; wolf (the gray wolf x eastern wolf hybrid (&quot;C. l. lycaon&quot;)) historically inhabited southern Ontario, southern Quebec and the northeastern United States alongside the Algonquin wolf, as there is evidence to suggest both inhabited those areas.

In 2016, a study of mDNA once again indicated the Eastern wolf as a coyote–wolf hybrid.

In 2018, a study looked at the Y-chromosome male lineage of canines. The unexpected finding was that the one Great Lakes wolf specimen included in this study showed a high degree of genetic divergence. Previous studies propose the Great Lakes wolf to be an ancient ecotype of the gray wolf that had experienced genetic introgression from other types of gray wolves and coyotes. The study called for further research into the Y-chromosomes of coyotes and wolves to ascertain if this is where this unique genetic male lineage may have originated from.

====Genomic evidence====
In 2016, a whole-genome DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000–117,000 years ago, including the coyote diverging from Eurasian wolf about 51,000 years ago (which matches other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time), the red wolf diverging from the coyote between 55,000–117,000 years ago, and the eastern wolf (Great Lakes region and Algonquin) wolf diverging from the coyote 27,000–32,000 years ago, and asserts that these do not qualify as an ancient divergences that justify them being considered unique species.

The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly admixed with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. The study found that coyote ancestry was highest in red wolves from the southeast of the United States and lowest among the Great Lakes wolves.

The study also determined how unique each type of canids alleles were compared to Eurasian wolves, all of which had no coyote ancestry. It found the following proportion of unique alleles: coyotes 5.13% unique; red wolf 4.41%; Algonquin wolves 3.82%; Great Lakes wolves 3.61%; and gray wolves 3.3%. They asserted that the amount of unique alleles in all wolves was lower than expected and does not support an ancient (greater than 250,000 years) unique ancestry for any of the species.

The authors contended that the proportion of unique alleles and ratio of wolf / coyote ancestry findings matched the south to north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization since the 18th century and the resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the southeast, and as the wolf population declined wolf–coyote admixture increased. Later, this process occurred in the Great Lakes region and then eastern Canada with the influx of coyotes replacing wolves, followed by the expansion of coyotes and their hybrids. The Great Lakes and Algonquin wolves largely reflect lineages that have descendants in the modern wolf and coyote populations, but also reflect a distinct gray wolf ecotype which may have descendants in the modern wolf populations.

As a result of these findings, the American Society of Mammalogists recognizes &quot;Canis lycaon&quot; as its own species.

The proposed timing of the wolf/coyote divergence conflicts with the finding of a coyote-like specimen in strata dated to 1 million years before present.

In 2017 a group of canid researchers challenged the 2016 whole-genome DNA study&#x27;s finding that the red wolf and the eastern wolf were the result of recent coyote–gray wolf hybridization. The group asserts the three-year generation time used to calculate the divergence periods between different species was lower than empirical estimates of 4.7 years. The group also found deficiencies in the previous study&#x27;s selection of specimens (two representative coyotes were from areas where recent coyote and gray wolf mixing with eastern wolves is known to have occurred), the lack of certainty in the ancestry of the selected Algonquin wolves, and the grouping of Great Lakes and Algonquin wolves together as eastern wolves, despite opposing genetic evidence. As well, they asserted the 2016 study ignored the fact that there is no evidence of hybridization between coyotes and gray wolves.

The group also questioned the conclusions of genetic differentiation analysis in the study stating that results showing Great Lakes, Algonquin and red wolves, plus eastern coyotes differentiated from gray and Eurasian wolves were actually more consistent with an ancient hybridization or a distinct cladogenic origin for the red and Algonquin wolves than of a recent hybrid origin. The group further asserted that the levels of unique alleles for red and Algonquin wolves found the 2017 study were high enough to reveal a high degree of evolutionary distinctness. Therefore, the group argues that both the red wolf and the eastern wolf remain genetically distinct North American taxa. This was rebutted by the authors of the earlier study.

====Wolf genome====
Genetic studies relating to wolves or dogs have inferred phylogenetic relationships based on the only reference genome available: that of the dog breed called the Boxer. In 2017, the first reference genome of the wolf &quot;Canis lupus lupus&quot; was mapped to aid future research. In 2018, a study looked at the genomic structure and admixture of North American wolves, wolf-like canids, and coyotes using specimens from across their entire range that mapped the largest dataset of nuclear genome sequences and compared these against the wolf reference genome. The study supports the findings of previous studies that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing. A polar wolf from Greenland and a coyote from Mexico represented the purest specimens. The coyotes from Alaska, California, Alabama, and Quebec show almost no wolf ancestry. Coyotes from Missouri, Illinois, and Florida exhibit 5–10% wolf ancestry. There was 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry in red wolves, 60%:40% in eastern wolves, and 75%:25% in the Great Lakes wolves. There was 10% coyote ancestry in Mexican wolves, 5% in Pacific Coast and Yellowstone wolves, and less than 3% in Canadian archipelago wolves.

The study indicates that the genomic ancestry of red, eastern and Great Lakes wolves were the result of admixture between modern gray wolves and modern coyotes. This was then followed by development into local populations. Individuals within each group showed consistent levels of coyote to wolf inheritance, indicating that this was the result of relatively ancient admixture. The eastern wolf as found in Algonquin Provincial Park is genetically closely related to the Great Lakes wolf as found in Minnesota and Isle Royale National Park in Michigan. If a third canid had been involved in the admixture of the North American wolf-like canids, then its genetic signature would have been found in coyotes and wolves, which it has not.

Later in 2018, a study based on a much smaller sample of 65,000 SNPs found that although the eastern wolf carries regional gray wolf and coyote alleles (gene variants), it also exhibits some alleles that are unique and therefore worthy of conservation.

In 2023, a genomic study indicates that eastern wolves have evolved separately from grey wolves for the past 67,000 years and had experienced admixture with coyotes 37,000 years ago. The Great Lakes wolves were the result of admixture between eastern wolves and grey wolves 8,000 years ago. Eastern coyotes were the result of admixture between eastern wolves and &quot;western&quot; coyotes during the last century.

====Ancestor====
The software that is currently used to conduct whole genome analysis for evidence of hybridization does not distinguish between past and present hybridization. In 2021, an mDNA analysis of modern and extinct North American wolf-like canines indicates that the extinct Late Pleistocene Beringian wolf was the ancestor of the southern wolf clade, which includes the Mexican wolf and the Great Plains wolf. The Mexican wolf is the most ancestral of the gray wolves that live in North America today. The modern coyote appeared around 10,000 years ago. The most genetically basal coyote mDNA clade pre-dates the Last Glacial Maximum and is a haplotype that can only be found in the Eastern wolf. This implies that the large, wolf-like Pleistocene coyote was the ancestor of the Eastern wolf. Further, another ancient haplotype detected in the Eastern wolf can be found only in the Mexican wolf. The authors propose that Pleistocene coyote and Beringian wolf admixture led to the Eastern wolf long before the arrival of the modern coyote and the modern wolf.

==Description and ecology==
===Description===
Charles Darwin was told that there were two types of wolf living in the Catskill Mountains, one being a lightly-built, greyhound-like animal that pursued deer, and the other being a bulkier, shorter-legged wolf. The eastern wolf&#x27;s fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown coloration, mixed with cinnamon. The flanks and chest are rufous or creamy, while the nape, shoulder and tail region are a mix of black and gray. Unlike gray wolves, eastern wolves rarely produce melanistic individuals. The first documented all-black eastern wolf was found to have been an eastern wolf–gray wolf hybrid. Like the red wolf, the eastern wolf is intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, with females weighing on average and males . Like the gray wolf, its average lifespan is 3–4 years, with a maximum of 15 years. Their physical sizes that sets them intermediate between gray wolves and coyotes are actually believed to be more related to their adaptations to an environment with predominately medium-sized prey (similar to the case with the Mexican wolf in the southwestern US) rather than their close relationship to red wolves and coyotes.

===Ecology and behaviour===
The eastern wolf primarily targets small to medium-sized prey items like white-tailed deer and beavers, unlike the gray wolf, which can effectively hunt large ungulates like caribou, elk, moose and bison. Despite being carnivores, packs in Voyageurs National Park forage for blueberries in much of July and August, when the berries are in season. Packs carefully avoid each other; only lone wolves sometimes enter other packs&#x27; territories. The average territory ranges , and the earliest age of dispersal for young eastern wolves is 15 weeks, much earlier than gray wolves.

==Distribution==
The past range of the eastern wolf included southern Quebec, most of Ontario, the Great Lakes states, New York State and New England. Today, the Great Lakes wolf is generally found in the northern halves of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southeastern Manitoba and northern Ontario, and the Algonquin wolf inhabits central and eastern Ontario as well as southwestern Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River. Algonquin wolves are particularly concentrated in Algonquin Provincial Park and other nearby protected areas, such as Killarney, Kawartha Highlands and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Parks and recent surveys also reveal small numbers of Algonquin wolves in the southern areas of northeastern Ontario and northwestern Ontario as far west as the Lake of the Woods near the border with Manitoba, where there is some mixing with Great Lakes wolves, and into southcentral Ontario, where there is some mixing with eastern coyotes. There are some reports of eastern wolf sightings and of wolves being shot by hunters in Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River, New Brunswick, New York State, northern Vermont and Maine. For example, DNA results of a canid killed near Cherry Valley, New York, in 2021 initially pointed to it being an eastern coyote, but a recent statement by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) confirms the animal was a wolf, with most of its ancestry matching wolves in Michigan; the DEC also has not confirmed or denied a breeding population within the state. Certain proponents of wolf recolonization state that wolves are already established in New York and New England, and have naturally dispersed from Canada by crossing the frozen St. Lawrence River.

==History, hybridization and conservation==
Mitochondrial DNA indicates that before the arrival of Europeans, eastern wolves may have numbered at 64,500 to 90,200 individuals. In 1942 it was believed that, before European settlement, the wolf had ranged throughout the wooded and open areas of eastern North America from what is now southern Quebec westward to the Great Plains and towards the Southeastern Woodlands (the southern extent was uncertain, but was believed to around what is now Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina). The region&#x27;s indigenous human populations did not fear eastern wolves, though they did occasionally catch them in traps, and their bones occur in native shell heaps.

Early European settlers often kept their livestock on eastern wolf-free outer islands, though animals kept in pasture on the mainland were vulnerable, to the point that a campaign against eastern wolves was launched in the early years of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, in which both settlers and natives participated. A bounty system was put into effect, offering higher rewards for adult wolves, with their heads exposed on hooks in meetinghouses. Nevertheless, wolves were still plentiful enough in New England in the early 18th century to warrant the settlers of Cape Cod discussing the building of a high fence between Sandwich and Wareham to keep them out of grazing lands. The scheme failed, though the settlers continued to utilize wolf pits, a wolf trapping technique learned from the region&#x27;s indigenous peoples. Eastern wolf numbers declined noticeably shortly before and after the American Revolution, particularly in Connecticut, where the wolf bounty was repealed in 1774. Eastern wolf numbers, however, were still high enough to cause concern in the more sparsely populated areas of southern New Hampshire and Maine, with wolf hunting becoming a regular occupation among settlers and natives alike. By the early 19th century, few eastern wolves remained in southern New Hampshire and Vermont.

Prior to the establishment of Algonquin Provincial Park in 1893, the eastern wolf was common in central Ontario and the Algonquin Highlands. It continued to persist throughout the late 1800s, despite extensive logging and efforts by park rangers to eliminate it, largely due to the sustaining influence of plentiful prey items like deer and beaver. By the mid-1900s, there were as many as 55 eastern wolf packs in the park, with an average of 49 wolves being killed annually during 1909–1958, until they were given official protection by the Ontario government in 1959, by which time the eastern wolf population in and around the park had been reduced to 500–1,000 individuals. Nevertheless, during 1964–1965, 36% of the park&#x27;s wolf population was culled by researchers trying to understand the reproduction and age structure of the population. This cull coincided with the expansion of coyotes into the park, and lead to an increase in eastern wolf–coyote hybridization. Introgression of gray wolf genes into the eastern wolf population also occurred across northern and eastern Ontario, into Manitoba and Quebec, as well as into the western Great Lakes states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Despite protection within the park boundaries, there was a population decline in the east side of the park during 1987–1999, with an estimated number of 30 packs by 2000. This decline exceeded annual recruitment, and was attributed to human-caused mortality, which mostly occurred when dispersing animals left the park in search of deer during the winter months, and when pack ranges overlapped with park boundaries. By 2001, protection was extended to eastern wolves occurring in the outskirts of the park. By 2012, the genetic composition of the park&#x27;s eastern wolves was roughly restored to what it was in the mid-1960s than in the 1980s–1990s, when the majority of wolves had large amounts of coyote DNA.

In 2013, an experiment which produced hybrids of coyotes and northwestern gray wolves in captivity using artificial insemination contributed more information to the controversy surrounding the eastern wolf&#x27;s taxonomy. The purpose of this project was to determine whether the female western coyotes are capable of bearing hybrid western gray wolf-coyote pups, as well as to test the hybrid theory surrounding the origin of the eastern wolves. The resulting six hybrids produced in this captive artificial breeding were later transferred to the Wildlife Science Center of Forest Lake in Minnesota, where their behaviors were studied.

==Relationships with humans==

===In Algonquin folklore===
The wolf is prominently portrayed in Algonquin mythology, where it is referred to as &quot;ma-hei-gan&quot; or &quot;nah-poo-tee&quot; in the Algonquian languages. It is the spirit brother of the Algonquian folk hero Nanabozho, and assisted him in several of his adventures, including thwarting the plots of the malicious anamakqui spirits and assisting him in recreating the world after a worldwide flood.

===Howling===
Since the discovery in 1963 that eastern wolves answered human imitations of their howls, Algonquin Provincial Park began its Public Wolf Howls attraction, where as many as 2,500 visitors are led on expeditions into areas where eastern wolves were sighted the night before and listen to them answering the park staff&#x27;s imitation howls. By 2000, 85 Public Wolf Howls had been held, with over 110,000 people having participated. The park considers the attraction as the cornerstone of its wolf education program and credits it with changing public attitudes towards wolves in Ontario.

===Attacks on humans===
Since the early 1970s, there have been several incidents of bold or aggressive behavior towards humans in Algonquin Provincial Park. Between 1987 and 1996, there were four instances of wolves biting people. The most serious case occurred in 1998 when a male wolf that had been long noted to be unafraid of humans stalked a couple walking their four-year-old daughter in September that year, losing interest when the family took refuge in a trailer. Two days later, the wolf attacked a 19-month-old boy, causing several puncture wounds on his chest and back before being driven off by campers. After the animal was killed later that day, it was found to not be rabid.

<text>Ray &quot;Pablo&quot; Falconer (195515 November 1987) was an English reggae producer from Birmingham, England, active in the 1970s and 1980s. Brother to Earl Falconer from UB40, Falconer produced many singles and albums for that band.

Falconer died in a car crash in Birmingham in 1987. Earl Falconer, who was driving the car where his brother died, was sentenced at the time to six months&#x27; imprisonment for drunk driving, in June 1988.

<doc id="701934" wikidata="Q1406423" url="?curid=701934" title="Fermi's interaction">
<text>In particle physics, Fermi&#x27;s interaction (also the Fermi theory of beta decay or the Fermi [[four-fermion interaction]]) is an explanation of the beta decay, proposed by Enrico Fermi in 1933. The theory posits four fermions directly interacting with one another (at one vertex of the associated Feynman diagram). This interaction explains beta decay of a neutron by direct coupling of a neutron with an electron, a neutrino (later determined to be an antineutrino) and a proton.

Fermi first introduced this coupling in his description of beta decay in 1933. The Fermi interaction was the precursor to the theory for the weak interaction where the interaction between the proton–neutron and electron–antineutrino is mediated by a virtual W− boson, of which the Fermi theory is the low-energy effective field theory.

According to Eugene Wigner, who together with Jordan introduced the Jordan–Wigner transformation, Fermi&#x27;s paper on beta decay was his main contribution to the history of physics.

== History of initial rejection and later publication ==
Fermi first submitted his &quot;tentative&quot; theory of beta decay to the prestigious science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which rejected it &quot;because it contained speculations too remote from reality to be of interest to the reader.&quot; It has been argued that &quot;Nature&quot; later admitted the rejection to be one of the great editorial blunders in its history, but Fermi&#x27;s biographer David N. Schwartz has objected that this is both unproven and unlikely. Fermi then submitted revised versions of the paper to Italian and German publications, which accepted and published them in those languages in 1933 and 1934. The paper did not appear at the time in a primary publication in English. An English translation of the seminal paper was published in the American Journal of Physics in 1968.

Fermi found the initial rejection of the paper so troubling that he decided to take some time off from theoretical physics, and do only experimental physics. This would lead shortly to his famous work with activation of nuclei with slow neutrons.

==The &quot;tentativo&quot;==

=== Definitions ===

The theory deals with three types of particles presumed to be in direct interaction: initially a “heavy particle” in the “neutron state” (formula_1), which then transitions into its “proton state” (formula_2) with the emission of an electron and a neutrino.

====Electron state====
:formula_3

where formula_4 is the single-electron wavefunction, formula_5 are its stationary states.

formula_6 is the operator which annihilates an electron in state formula_7 which acts on the Fock space as

:formula_8

formula_9 is the creation operator for electron state formula_10

:formula_11

====Neutrino state====
Similarly,

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the single-neutrino wavefunction, and formula_14 are its stationary states.

formula_15 is the operator which annihilates a neutrino in state formula_16 which acts on the Fock space as

:formula_17

formula_18 is the creation operator for neutrino state formula_16.

====Heavy particle state====
formula_20 is the operator introduced by Heisenberg (later generalized into isospin) that acts on a heavy particle state, which has eigenvalue +1 when the particle is a neutron, and −1 if the particle is a proton. Therefore, heavy particle states will be represented by two-row column vectors, where

:formula_21

represents a neutron, and

:formula_22

represents a proton (in the representation where formula_20 is the usual formula_24 spin matrix).

The operators that change a heavy particle from a proton into a neutron and vice versa are respectively represented by

:formula_25

and

:formula_26

formula_27 resp. formula_28 is an eigenfunction for a neutron resp. proton in the state formula_29.

===Hamiltonian===

The Hamiltonian is composed of three parts: formula_30, representing the energy of the free heavy particles, formula_31, representing the energy of the free light particles, and a part giving the interaction formula_32.

:formula_33

where formula_34 and formula_35 are the energy operators of the neutron and proton respectively, so that if formula_36, formula_37, and if formula_2, formula_39.

:formula_40

where formula_41 is the energy of the electron in the formula_42 state in the nucleus&#x27;s Coulomb field, and formula_43 is the number of electrons in that state; formula_44 is the number of neutrinos in the formula_45 state, and formula_46 energy of each such neutrino (assumed to be in a free, plane wave state).

The interaction part must contain a term representing the transformation of a proton into a neutron along with the emission of an electron and a neutrino (now known to be an antineutrino), as well as a term for the inverse process; the Coulomb force between the electron and proton is ignored as irrelevant to the formula_47-decay process.

Fermi proposes two possible values for formula_32: first, a non-relativistic version which ignores spin:

:formula_49

and subsequently a version assuming that the light particles are four-component Dirac spinors, but that speed of the heavy particles is small relative to formula_50 and that the interaction terms analogous to the electromagnetic vector potential can be ignored:

:formula_51

where formula_4 and formula_13 are now four-component Dirac spinors, formula_54 represents the Hermitian conjugate of formula_4, and formula_56 is a matrix

:formula_57

===Matrix elements===

The state of the system is taken to be given by the tuple formula_58 where formula_59 specifies whether the heavy particle is a neutron or proton, formula_29 is the quantum state of the heavy particle, formula_43 is the number of electrons in state formula_7 and formula_44 is the number of neutrinos in state formula_16.

Using the relativistic version of formula_32, Fermi gives the matrix element between the state with a neutron in state formula_29 and no electrons resp. neutrinos present in state formula_7 resp. formula_68, and the state with a proton in state formula_69 and an electron and a neutrino present in states formula_7 and formula_16 as

:formula_72

where the integral is taken over the entire configuration space of the heavy particles (except for formula_20). The formula_74 is determined by whether the total number of light particles is odd (−) or even (+).

===Transition probability===

To calculate the lifetime of a neutron in a state formula_29 according to the usual quantum perturbation theory, the above matrix elements must be summed over all unoccupied electron and neutrino states. This is simplified by assuming that the electron and neutrino eigenfunctions formula_5 and formula_14 are constant within the nucleus (i.e., their Compton wavelength is much larger than the size of the nucleus). This leads to

:formula_78

where formula_5 and formula_14 are now evaluated at the position of the nucleus.

According to Fermi&#x27;s golden rule, the probability of this transition is

:formula_81

where formula_82 is the difference in the energy of the proton and neutron states.

Averaging over all positive-energy neutrino spin / momentum directions (where formula_83 is the density of neutrino states, eventually taken to infinity), we obtain

:formula_84

where formula_85 is the rest mass of the neutrino and formula_47 is the Dirac matrix.

Noting that the transition probability has a sharp maximum for values of formula_87 for which formula_88, this simplifies to 

:formula_89

where formula_87 and formula_46 is the values for which formula_88.

Fermi makes three remarks about this function:
* Since the neutrino states are considered to be free, formula_93 and thus the upper limit on the continuous formula_47-spectrum is formula_95.
* Since for the electrons formula_96, in order for formula_47-decay to occur, the proton–neutron energy difference must be formula_98
* The factor 
::formula_99 
:in the transition probability is normally of magnitude 1, but in special circumstances it vanishes; this leads to (approximate) selection rules for formula_47-decay.

===Forbidden transitions===
As noted above, when the inner product formula_101 between the heavy particle states formula_27 and formula_103 vanishes, the associated transition is &quot;forbidden&quot; (or, rather, much less likely than in cases where it is closer to 1).

If the description of the nucleus in terms of the individual quantum states of the protons and neutrons is accurate to a good approximation, formula_101 vanishes unless the neutron state formula_27 and the proton state formula_103 have the same angular momentum; otherwise, the total angular momentum of the entire nucleus before and after the decay must be used.

==Influence==

Shortly after Fermi&#x27;s paper appeared, Werner Heisenberg noted in a letter to Wolfgang Pauli that the emission and absorption of neutrinos and electrons in the nucleus should, at the second order of perturbation theory, lead to an attraction between protons and neutrons, analogously to how the emission and absorption of photons leads to the electromagnetic force. He found that the force would be of the form formula_107, but noted that contemporary experimental data led to a value that was too small by a factor of a million.

The following year, Hideki Yukawa picked up on this idea, but in his theory the neutrinos and electrons were replaced by a new hypothetical particle with a rest mass approximately 200 times heavier than the electron.

==Later developments==

Fermi&#x27;s four-fermion theory describes the weak interaction remarkably well. Unfortunately, the calculated cross-section, or probability of interaction, grows as the square of the energy formula_108. Since this cross section grows without bound, the theory is not valid at energies much higher than about 100 GeV. Here is the Fermi constant, which denotes the strength of the interaction. This eventually led to the replacement of the four-fermion contact interaction by a more complete theory (UV completion)—an exchange of a W or Z boson as explained in the electroweak theory.

The interaction could also explain muon decay via a coupling of a muon, electron-antineutrino, muon-neutrino and electron, with the same fundamental strength of the interaction. This hypothesis was put forward by Gershtein and Zeldovich and is known as the Vector Current Conservation hypothesis.

In the original theory, Fermi assumed that the form of interaction is a contact coupling of two vector currents. Subsequently, it was pointed out by Lee and Yang that nothing prevented the appearance of an axial, parity violating current, and this was confirmed by experiments carried out by Chien-Shiung Wu.

The inclusion of parity violation in Fermi&#x27;s interaction was done by George Gamow and Edward Teller in the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions which described Fermi&#x27;s interaction in terms of parity-violating &quot;allowed&quot; decays and parity-conserving &quot;superallowed&quot; decays in terms of anti-parallel and parallel electron and neutrino spin states respectively. Before the advent of the electroweak theory and the Standard Model, George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak, and also independently Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann, were able to determine the correct tensor structure (vector minus axial vector, ) of the four-fermion interaction.

==Fermi constant==
The most precise experimental determination of the Fermi constant comes from measurements of the muon lifetime, which is inversely proportional to the square of (when neglecting the muon mass against the mass of the W boson). In modern terms, the &quot;reduced Fermi constant&quot;, that is, the constant in natural units is
:formula_109
Here, is the coupling constant of the weak interaction, and is the mass of the W boson, which mediates the decay in question.

In the Standard Model, the Fermi constant is related to the Higgs vacuum expectation value 
:formula_110.

More directly, approximately (tree level for the standard model),
:formula_111

This can be further simplified in terms of the Weinberg angle using the relation between the W and Z bosons with formula_112, so that
:formula_113

<text>Kings of the High Frontier is a hard science fiction novel by American writer Victor Koman, first published (electronically) in 1996.

==Summary==
The story is a polemic about NASA. The thesis is that NASA, far from helping space exploration, actually prevents it from going forth. The narrative follows disparate engineering efforts, ranging from New York University engineering students working out of a warehouse in the Bronx to full-fledged commercial rocket operations, to create a single-stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle.

<text>Wilson Shannon (February 24, 1802 – August 30, 1877) was an American attorney and Democratic Party politician from Ohio. He served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives and was the 14th and 16th governor of Ohio. He was the first Ohio governor born in the state. He was the second governor of the Kansas Territory. He failed to stop an attack by pro-slavery forces and retaliation ensued. He fled and submitted a resignation letter before receiving official news of his firing. Earlier in his career he filed sued for past due loans against Franklin College and helped bankrupt and close down the abolitionist institution before starting a rival institution which failed. Franklin College was re-established.

==Early life==
Shannon was born in Belmont County in the Northwest Territory, the son of an Irish immigrant, George Shannon, who fought in the Revolutionary War. Wilson Shannon&#x27;s elder brother, Thomas Shannon, served a partial term in the United States House of Representatives from 1826–1827. His oldest brother, George Shannon, was the youngest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

==Ohio politics==
After attending Ohio University, Franklin College in New Athens, Ohio and Transylvania University in Kentucky. Shannon was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in 1830. He was prosecuting attorney for Belmont County from 1833 to 1835.

Shannon ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832, losing by only 37 votes. Shannon then served as a prosecutor in Belmont County before winning election to the governorship in 1838. He lost a re-election bid to the Whig candidate, Thomas Corwin, in 1840, but defeated Corwin for a second term two years later.

==Federal appointments==
Shannon resigned on April 15, 1844, to take up an appointment from President John Tyler as Minister to Mexico. Shannon spent a year in the post before being recalled. 

Shannon went to California in the 1849 gold rush but returned and later won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852. He served a single term before taking up an appointment from President Franklin Pierce as Governor of the Kansas Territory in 1855.

==Kansas Territory==
Shannon was commissioned by President Pierce on August 10, 1855. He took the oath of office on September 7, 1855, and served until June 24, 1856, having been sworn into office a second time on June 13, 1856. He then served from July 7 through August 18, 1856, when he was removed from office by the President. Shannon was known for his Southern sympathies, so much so that he was described by a contemporary as &quot;an extreme Southern man in politics, of the border ruffian type.&quot; Shannon frequently used federal troops to bring peace to areas of the territory where violence was commonplace. However, the problems of government administration he experienced while Minister to Mexico plagued him in Kansas, and he stumbled into one political crisis after another.

In May 1856, a large proslavery force entered Lawrence and destroyed many buildings and printing presses in what became known as the &quot;Sacking of Lawrence.&quot; Shannon failed to intervene to protect the citizens and their property. In retaliation, John Brown and a small group of followers moved along Pottawatomie Creek, 40 miles south of Lawrence, killing five proslavery settlers. The &quot;Pottawatomie massacre&quot;, as it came to be known, brought even more violence into the territory. Shannon lost complete control of the territory and left for St. Louis on June 23, 1856, leaving Daniel Woodson as acting governor.

While at Lecompton, Shannon offered President Pierce his resignation on August 18, 1856, but Pierce had already determined to fire him. In his resignation he wrote that he had

received unofficial information of my removal from office, and finding myself here without the moral power which my official station confers, and being destitute of any adequate military force to preserve the peace of the country, I feel it due to myself, as well as to the government, to notify you that I am unwilling to perform the duties of government of this territory any longer. You will therefore consider my official connection at an end.

Shannon feared for his life and returned east. He met John Geary, the next territorial governor, on September 7 at Glasgow, Missouri, though their meeting was brief.

Despite his troubled term as territorial governor of Kansas, Shannon served the longest continuous term of any Kansas territorial governor, more than nine-and-one-half months of an eleven-month term.

==Later life==
Shannon returned to Kansas soon after leaving office. He set up a law practice in Lecompton, and later a practice in Lawrence and Topeka. To visitors he frequently stated: &quot;Govern Kansas in 1855 and &#x27;56! You might as well attempt to govern the devil in hell.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Shannon died in Lawrence on August 30, 1877, and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence.

Shannon, Kansas, the first county seat of Anderson County, was named for Shannon. The town ceased to exist in 1860.

<text>Webster English Young (December 3, 1932 – December 13, 2003) was an American jazz trumpeter and cornetist.

Born in Columbia, South Carolina, and raised in Washington, D.C., Young was known for his lyrical playing, and performed with John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, Hampton Hawes, Jackie McLean, and Ike and Tina Turner, among others. He recorded only sparingly; his principal album as a leader, &quot;For Lady&quot; (Prestige, 1957), was mainly dedicated to tunes associated with Billie Holiday.

In the late 1950s, at the suggestion of Miles Davis, Webster Young moved to New York City, where he began performing with musicians such as Lester Young and Bud Powell. During the mid-1960s, Young returned to Washington, D.C., where he became an educator, teaching music theory at the University of the District of Columbia; he was also director of the District of Columbia Music Center jazz workshop band.

Webster Young died on December 13, 2003, from brain cancer in Vancouver, Washington.

<text>Winston Ntshona (6 October 1941 – 2 August 2018) was a South African playwright and actor. He won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1975.

==Biography==
Born in Port Elizabeth, Zola Winston Ntshona worked alongside fellow South African Athol Fugard on several occasions, most notably in the 1980 film version of Fugard&#x27;s play &quot;Marigolds in August&quot;, and played a minor role in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s acclaimed film &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) and a major role in the film &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989).

==Career==
Ntshona attended Newell High School in Port Elizabeth, where he met long time collaborator and South African acting legend John Kani. Between 1963 and 1972 Ntshona worked as a laboratory assistant in a timber factory. 
In 1967 he joined the Serpent Players drama group alongside John Kani and Athol Fugard. Black members of the drama group all had day time jobs. Rehearsals and workshops would take place in the evenings or during weekends. Reputation of their work grew over time, and Winston Ntshona had to quit his job at the timber factory, becoming an employee of The Serpent Players.
With Fugard and John Kani, Ntshona wrote the 1973 play &quot;The Island&quot;. He and Kani starred in a number of major international productions over the next 30 years. Ntshona and Kani were co-winners of the Tony Award for Best Actor in a play for their performance in both &quot;The Island&quot; and &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, which he also co-wrote. This was a first for black actors at the time.

==&quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;==
In 1972–73, he was a cast member of the critically acclaimed stage play &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, which premiered at the Space Theatre in Cape Town, a play critical of the Apartheid government&#x27;s pass laws of the time. &quot;Sizwe Banzi is Dead&quot; was invited to play for a one-off show in New York, but word of the play soon spread to Europe. A national tour of England was followed by an invitation to play at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre for a six-week run. They returned to the United States for an extensive run of the show on Broadway. Between 1967 and 1972 Ntshona appeared in over 20 stage productions for the Serpent Players. The success of &quot;Sizwe Banzi is Dead&quot; was quickly followed up with the equally acclaimed play &quot;The Island&quot;. The Serpent Players returned to South Africa in 1976 and began to tour both &quot;Sizwe Banzi is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot; in rural areas around the country, where they also conducted acting workshops.

==Film career==
Ntshona&#x27;s first screen role came when he and Kani were invited by producer Euan Lloyd to audition for roles in a British film. Ntshona played deposed President Julius Limbani, the subject of a rescue attempt in &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978). Limbani is based on Moise Tshombe. He also played a similar role in &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1980) as Dr. Okoye, a moderate political figure thrown in jail by the dictator President Kimba of the fictional Republic of Zangaro. His other film credits include roles in &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979), &quot;Night of the Cyclone&quot; (1991), &quot;The Power of One&quot; (1992), &quot;The Air Up There&quot; (1994) and &quot;Tarzan and the Lost City&quot; (1998).

In 1979 he appeared in Michael Hastings&#x27; monologue &quot;Full Frontal&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in London.

With Fugard and John Kani, Ntshona wrote the 1973 play &quot;The Island&quot;, in which he and Kani starred in a number of major international productions over the next 30 years. He and Kani were co-winners of the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for their performance in both &quot;The Island&quot; and &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, which he also co-wrote.

==Arrests==
In October 1976 Ntshona and Kani were arrested and thrown into solitary confinement for 15 days by the then Transkei government. The order was given by the Minister of Justice George Matanzima, who was also brother to the Prime Minister of the Transkei homeland, Kaiser Matanzima. They were held under the Transkei&#x27;s Proclamation R.400, because Matanzima believed the play &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot; had &#x27;inflammable, abusive and vulgar subject matter&#x27;.

==Personal life and death==
In 2010 Ntshona was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for his vast contribution to the South African arts and culture landscape.

Ntshona died on 2 August 2018 following a lengthy undisclosed illness. He was 76.

<text>Oliver Prince Smith (October 26, 1893 – December 25, 1977) was a U.S. Marine four-star general and decorated combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War. He is most noted for commanding the 1st Marine Division during the first year of the Korean War, and notably during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, where he said &quot;Retreat, Hell! We&#x27;re just attacking in another direction.&quot; This is commonly misquoted as &quot;Retreat, hell! We&#x27;re not retreating, we&#x27;re just advancing in a different direction.&quot; He retired at the rank of four-star general, being advanced in rank for having been specially commended for heroism in combat.

==Military career==
===Early years===
Smith was born in Menard, Texas. His father died when he was seven, and his mother moved to Northern California. He graduated from Santa Cruz High School in 1911. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, working his way through college doing odd jobs (mostly gardening). After graduation, he reported for active duty as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps in 1917. Smith was a quiet, shy Christian Scientist.

The following month he was assigned his first overseas tour at Guam, Marianas Islands, where he served with the Marine Barracks, Naval Station. While in Guam, (then) Lieutenant Smith was married to Esther Laurilla King of Hayward, California. They remained married for 58 years. In May 1919, he returned to the United States for duty with the Marine barracks at Mare Island, California.

Ordered to sea duty in October 1921, Lieutenant Smith served as commanding officer of the Marine Detachment aboard the until May 1924. At that time he was assigned to Marine Corps Headquarters, Washington, D.C., for duty with the personnel section.

Returning overseas in June 1928, he joined the Gendarmerie of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, as assistant chief of staff. Following his return from foreign shore duty in June 1931, he became a student at the Field Officer&#x27;s Course, U.S. Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia. Graduating in June 1932, he was ordered to duty at the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia, as an instructor in the Company Officers&#x27; Course. In September 1933, he was named assistant operations officer of the 7th Marine Regiment at Quantico.

Smith sailed for France in January 1934, where he joined the staff of the American Embassy in Paris for duty with the Office of the U.S. Naval Attaché. From November 1934 to July 1936, while in Paris, he became the first Marine Corps officer to matriculate at the Ecole Supérieure de Guerre.

He returned to the United States in August 1936, and joined the staff of the Marine Corps Schools at Quantico, as an instructor in the S-3 Section, (Operations and Training). He acquired the nickname &quot;the professor,&quot; gained a reputation as an intellectual during these years and was recognized as an expert on amphibious warfare.

Smith was transferred to the West Coast in July 1939, where he joined the Fleet Marine Force as operations officer at the Marine Corps Base, San Diego, California.

In June of the following year, he became commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, and in May 1941, sailed with the 6th Marine Regiment for Iceland where he remained until returning to the United States in March 1942.

===World War II===
In May 1942, Smith was ordered to Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C., where he became executive officer of the Division of Plans and Policies. He remained in this capacity until January 1944, when he joined the 1st Marine Division on New Britain. There he took command of the 5th Marine Regiment and subsequently led the regiment in the Talasea phase of the Cape Gloucester operation.

In April 1944, he was named assistant division commander of the 1st Marine Division and participated in operations against the Japanese in the Peleliu operation during September and October 1944.

Smith became Marine deputy chief of staff of the Tenth Army in November 1944, and participated in the Battle of Okinawa from April through June 1945.

In July 1945, he returned to the United States and became commandant of the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, and in January 1948, was named commanding general, Marine Barracks, Quantico, in addition to his duties at the school. Three months later, he became assistant commandant of the Marine Corps and chief of staff, Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. While there he served as editor-in-chief of the professional journal of U.S. Marines, the &quot;Marine Corps Gazette&quot;.

===Korean War===

Named Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division in June 1950, Major General Smith led his division through the bitter campaigns of the Korean War – from the late summer assault at Inchon, to the sub-zero winter drive north to the Chosin Reservoir.

In October 1950, the 1st Marine Division landed at Wonsan on the eastern side of Korea under the command of the Army&#x27;s X Corps commanded by Edward Almond. Almond and Smith shared a mutual loathing dating back to a meeting between the two in Japan before the Inchon landing. During the meeting Almond had spoken of how easy amphibious landings were although he had never planned, or taken part in one, and then referred to Smith as &quot;son&quot; although he was only 10 months older than Smith. Smith and the Marine command also felt Almond was too aggressive and were sure about large numbers of Chinese Forces in North Korea when higher headquarters in Tokyo was telling them that was not the case. Although ordered to go north to the Yalu River as fast as he could, Smith continuously slowed the division&#x27;s march to the point of near insubordination. Also along the way he established supply points and an airfield.

In November 1950, with the 1st Marine Division surrounded at the Chosin Reservoir, he directed the breakout and subsequent march to the seaport of Hungnam. In the end his careful march north and ability to keep the division together saved it—and quite possibly the entire X Corps—from total destruction.

General Smith returned to the United States, in May 1951, and was assigned duties as commanding general, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.

In July 1953, he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant general and assumed his final duties as commanding general, Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, and served in this capacity until his retirement, with the rank of general, on September 1, 1955.

Smith died in Los Altos, California on December 25, 1977.

<doc id="701970" wikidata="Q1055911" url="?curid=701970" title="Chess tactic">
<text>In chess, a tactic is a sequence of moves that each makes one or more immediate threats – a check, a threat, a checkmating sequence threat, or the threat of another tactic – that culminates in the opponent&#x27;s being unable to respond to all of the threats without making some kind of concession. Most often, the immediate benefit takes the form of a advantage or ; however, some tactics are used for defensive purposes and can salvage material that would otherwise be lost, or to induce stalemate in an otherwise lost position. 

Tactics are usually contrasted with strategy, whereby the individual moves by themselves do not make indefensible threats, and the cumulative advantage of them takes longer to capitalise. The dichotomy can be summarised as tactics concerning short-term play and strategy concerning long-term play. Examples of strategic advantages are in, compromised pawn structure in, and sustained pressure on, the opponent&#x27;s position. Often, to dichotomize strategy and tactics, sequences of moves that make strategic instead of tactical threats or use tactical threats to obtain a strategic advantage are also classified as tactics.

Tactics usually follow one of a number of repeating patterns; these include forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks, undermining, overloading, deflection, pins, and interference. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Middlegames&quot; gives the following tactics categories: Annihilation of Defense, Blockade, Decoying, Deflection, Demolition of Pawns, Discovered Attack, Double Attack, Interception, Intermediate Move, Overloading, Passed Pawn, Pawns Breakthrough, Pin, Pursuit (perpetual attack), Space Clearance, and X-ray Attack. Often tactics of more than one type are conjoined in a combination. 
==Attacking and defending pieces==
A piece is said to &quot;attack&quot; (or threaten) an opponent&#x27;s piece if, on the next move, it could capture that piece. A piece is said to &quot;defend&quot; (or protect) a piece of the defender&#x27;s color if, in case the defended piece were taken by the opponent, the defender could immediately recapture. Attacking a piece usually, but not always (see Sacrifice), forces the opponent to respond if the attacked piece is undefended, or if the attacking piece is of lower value than the one attacked.

When the piece attacked is a king, then a player has at most three options:
*capture the attacking piece;
*move the king to an adjacent square that is not under attack;
*interpose another piece in between the king and the attacking piece (if the attacker is not a knight and is not directly adjacent to the attacked king).

When the attacked piece is not a king, a player may have additional options, beyond the ones listed above:
*move the attacked piece to a square where it will not be under attack, or will be defended by another piece;
*move the attacked piece to a different attacked square, where a capture will result in a more advantageous position;
*defend the attacked piece, permitting an exchange;
*pin the attacking piece so the capture becomes illegal, unprofitable, or less damaging;
*capture a different piece of the opponent; 
*allow the attacked piece to be captured without immediate material compensation (i.e. sacrificed) for some other tactical advantage or for tempo;
*employ a &quot;zwischenzug&quot; (create a counter-threat).

==Gaining material==
When a player is able to capture the opponent&#x27;s piece(s) without losing any of their own (or losing a piece of lesser value), the player is said to have &quot;won &quot;; i.e., the opponent will have fewer (or less valuable) pieces remaining on the board. The goal of each basic tactic is to win material. At the professional level, often the mere threat of material loss (i.e., an anticipated tactic) induces the opponent to pursue an alternative line. In amateur games, however, tactics often come to full fruition – unforeseen by the opponent and resulting in material gain and a corresponding, perhaps decisive, advantage. Material gain can be achieved by several different types of tactics.

===Discovered attack===

A &quot;discovered attack&quot; is a move that allows an attack by another piece. A piece is moved away so as to allow the attack of a friendly bishop, rook or queen on an enemy piece. If the attacked piece is the king, the situation is referred to as a &quot;discovered check&quot;. Discovered attacks are powerful since the moved piece may be able to pose a second threat.

A special case of a discovered check is a &quot;double check&quot;, where both the piece being unmasked and the piece being moved (rarely a third piece instead, possible in the case of an en passant capture) attack the enemy king. A double check always forces the opponent to move the king, since it is impossible to defend against attacks from two directions in any other way.

===Fork===
A &quot;fork&quot; is a move that uses one piece to attack two or more of the opponent&#x27;s pieces simultaneously, with the aim to achieve material advantage, since the opponent can counter only one of the threats. Knights are often used for forks, with their unique moving and jumping ability, which makes them able to attack any enemy piece except for an enemy knight without being attacked in return. A common situation is a knight played to c2 or c7, threatening both the enemy rook and king. Such forks checking a king are particularly effective, because the opponent is forced by the rules of chess to immediately remove the check to their king. The opponent cannot choose to defend the other piece, or use a &quot;zwischenzug&quot; (other than a cross check) to complicate the situation. Pawns can also be effective in forking. By moving a pawn forward, it can attack two pieces—one diagonally to the left, and another diagonally to the right, and because it is worth less than all other pieces, it does not matter if either or both forked pieces are defended.

The queen is also an excellent forking piece, since she can move in eight different directions. However, a queen fork is only useful if both pieces are undefended, or if one is undefended and the other is the enemy&#x27;s king. The queen is the most valuable attacking piece, so it is usually not profitable for her to capture a defended piece.

Fork attacks can be either &quot;relative&quot; (meaning the attacked pieces comprise pawn[s], knight[s], bishop[s], rook[s], or queen[s]), or &quot;absolute&quot; (one of the attacked pieces is the enemy king, in check). The targets of a fork do not have to be pieces. One or more of the targets can be a mate threat (for example, forking a loose knight and setting up a battery of queen and bishop that creates a mate threat as well) or implied threat (for example, a knight move that forks a loose bishop and also threatens to fork enemy queen and rook).

===Pin===
A &quot;pin&quot; is a move that inhibits an opponent piece from moving, because doing so would expose a more valuable (or vulnerable) piece behind it. Only bishops, rooks, and queens can perform a pin, since they can move more than one square in a straight line. If the pinned piece cannot move because doing so would produce check, the pin is called &quot;absolute&quot;. If moving the pinned piece would expose a non-king piece, the pin is called &quot;relative&quot;.

===Skewer===

A &quot;skewer&quot; is a move that attacks two pieces in a line, similar to a pin, except that the enemy piece of greater value is in front of the piece of lesser value. After the more valuable piece moves away, the lesser piece can be captured. Like pins, only queens, rooks, and bishops can perform the skewer, and skewer attacks can be either &quot;absolute&quot; (the more valuable piece in front is the king, in check) or &quot;relative&quot; (the piece in front is a non-king piece).

==Pawns==

The pawn is the least valuable chess piece, so pawns are often used to capture defended pieces. A single pawn typically forces a more powerful piece, such as a rook or a knight, to retreat. The ability to fork two enemy pieces by advancing a pawn is often a threat. Alternately, a pawn move can itself reveal a discovered attack. When pawns are arranged on a diagonal, with each pawn guarded by the pawn behind it, they form a wall or &quot;&quot; protecting any friendly pieces behind them. A weak pawn structure, with unprotected or isolated pawns ahead of more valuable pieces, can be a decisive weakness. A pawn that has advanced all the way to the opposite side of the board is promoted to any other piece except a king.

==Sacrifices==

A &quot;sacrifice&quot; of some material is often necessary to throw the opponent&#x27;s position out of balance, potentially gaining positional advantage. The sacrificed material is sometimes later offset with a consequent material gain. Pawn sacrifices in the opening are known as gambits; they are usually not intended for material gain, but rather to achieve a more active position.

Direct attacks against the enemy king are often started by sacrifices. A common example is sacrificing a bishop on h2 or h7, checking the king, who usually must take the bishop. This allows the queen and knight to develop a fulminant attack.

==Zugzwang==

&quot;Zugzwang&quot; (German for &quot;compulsion to move&quot;) occurs when a player is forced to make an undesirable move. The player is put at a disadvantage because they would prefer to pass and make no move, but a move has to be made, all choices of which weaken their position. Situations involving zugzwang seldom occur before the endgame, where there are fewer choices of available moves.

==Zwischenzug==

&quot;Zwischenzug&quot; (German for &quot;intermediate move&quot;) is a common tactic in which a player under threat, instead of directly countering or recapturing, introduces an even more devastating threat. The tactic often involves a new attack against the opponent&#x27;s queen or king. The opponent then may be forced to address the new threat, abandoning the earlier attack.

Since 2007, he has been a senior consultant affiliated with Academic Search, Inc. (DC).

A native of Pasadena, CA, Hales attended Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada, California. He is the younger brother of mathematician Alfred W. Hales. In 1964, he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California. He then earned masters and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow during the 1964–1965 academic year and served as a teaching fellow from 1965–1967.

Hales joined the faculty of his alma mater, Pomona, in 1967. He was named associate dean of the college at Pomona in 1973 and served for one year (1982–83) as acting dean. In 1971, he received the Rudolph J. Wig Distinguished Professorship Award at Pomona. In 2004, Hales received an honorary doctorate of science degree from Pomona. Dr. Hales was among prestigious company: Walter Cronkite was a fellow degree recipient. In 2011, he received the honorary degree doctor of laws from The College of Wooster, and in 2013, the honorary degree doctor of humane letters from Centre College.

Hales served as treasurer and board member of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and chaired the executive committee of the Great Lakes Colleges Association. He is a former chair of the boards of directors of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, as well as past president of the North Coast Athletic Conference.

Hales is a two-time United States men&#x27;s singles champion in badminton, winning the titles in 1970 and 1971. During his 40-year career, he has played on and coached the U.S. Thomas Cup team. He was a member of the council of the International Badminton Federation for 10 years and was one of three deputy referees for the badminton competition at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, GA. Hales won back-to-back national junior titles in 1959 and 1960, and became a national champion again by winning the Grand Master&#x27;s (60 and over) men&#x27;s singles title in 2002 and 2003. He has co-authored a book on the sport with Margaret Varner Bloss titled &quot;Badminton&quot;.

In the area of public service, Hales served in 2003-04 as a member of Governor Robert A. Taft’s Commission of Higher Education and the Economy. In 2002–03, he chaired the Site Selection Task Force for Wayne County Chapter of the American Red Cross.

<text>Michael Earl Schoeffling (born December 10, 1960) is an American former actor and model. He is known for playing the roles of Jake Ryan in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, Al Carver in &quot;Wild Hearts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot;, Kuch in &quot;Vision Quest&quot;, and Joe in &quot;Mermaids&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Schoeffling was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and raised in South Jersey. He graduated from Cherokee High School in Evesham Township, New Jersey. He attended Temple University in Philadelphia, where he majored in liberal arts. In the mid-1980s he began modelling for &quot;GQ&quot;, and photographer Bruce Weber paid for his acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in Manhattan.

==Acting career==
Schoeffling came to international prominence at the age of 23 for his role as Jake Ryan, the popular yet sensitive high school athlete on whom Molly Ringwald&#x27;s character has a crush in the teen film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. For Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2004, twenty years after the film&#x27;s American premiere, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Real Men Can&#x27;t Hold a Match to Jake Ryan of &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;&quot;, which discussed the character&#x27;s enduring appeal.

He appeared in eight additional films after &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, including roles in &quot;Vision Quest&quot; and &quot;Mermaids&quot;, and starring roles in the 1986 action film &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Harry&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Wild Hearts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot;.

==Post-acting career==
After his acting career, Schoeffling opened a woodworking shop, producing handcrafted furniture. His withdrawal from Hollywood was complete, and he has not done any interviews, convention appearances or the like since then.

<doc id="701981" wikidata="Q110916" url="?curid=701981" title="Hideki Shirakawa">
<text>is a Japanese chemist, engineer, and Professor Emeritus at the University of Tsukuba and Zhejiang University. He is best known for his discovery of conductive polymers. He was co-recipient of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with Alan MacDiarmid and Alan Heeger.

== Early life and education ==

Hideki Shirakawa was born in Tokyo, Japan, the second son of a military doctor. He had one elder and one younger brother and sister. Olympic marathoner champion Naoko Takahashi is his second cousin-niece. He lived in Manchukuo and Taiwan during childhood. Around third grade, he moved to Takayama, Gifu, which is the hometown of his mother.

Shirakawa graduated from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering in 1961, and his doctorate in 1966. Afterward, he obtained the post of assistant in Chemical Resources Laboratory at Tokyo Tech.

== Career ==

While employed as an assistant at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) in Japan, Shirakawa developed polyacetylene, which has a metallic appearance. This result interested Alan MacDiarmid when MacDiarmid visited Tokyo Tech in 1975.

In 1976, he was invited to work in the laboratory of Alan MacDiarmid as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. The two developed the electrical conductivity of polyacetylene along with American physicist Alan Heeger.

In 1977 they discovered that doping with iodine vapor could enhance the conductivity of polyacetylene. The three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 in recognition of the discovery. With regard to the mechanism of electric conduction, it is strongly believed that nonlinear excitations in the form of solitons play a role.

In 1979, Shirakawa became an assistant professor in the University of Tsukuba; three years later, he advanced to a full professor. In 1991 he was appointed as Tsukuba&#x27;s Chief of Science and Engineering Department of Graduate School (until March, 1993), and as Tsukuba&#x27;s Chief of Category #3 group (until March, 1997).

== Research ==
Source:

Shirakawa&#x27;s research on conductive polymers can be broken down into four main categories: polyacetylene thin film synthesis, the causation of metallic conductivity due to chemical doping, the creation of conjugated (double or triple bonds in a molecule which are separated by a single bond) liquid crystalline polymers, and acetylene polymerization development that used liquid crystals as solvents.

# Polyacetylene Synthesis: Polyacetylene was expected to have certain properties, with insolubility making the substance difficult to work with. Dr. Shirakawa found that polyacetylene thin films can be synthesized, and with the thin films, the doctor clarified the molecular and solidified structures of polyacetylene.
# Creation of Metallic Conductivity: Dr. Shirakawa found that, when a trace of a halogen such as bromine or iodine is added to thin film polyacetylene, its electric conductivity increases, and it exhibits metallic conductivity. Shirakawa found that partial electron transfer between dopants and p-electrons of polyacetylene can generate metallic conductivity.
# Using Liquid Crystals to Develop Acetylene Polymerization: Dr. Shirakawa developed a method for the production of highly conductive polyacetylene thin films which paralleled the polymerization of acetylene. Furthermore, he succeeded in the synthesis of thin films of helical polyacetylene whose chirality is controllable.
##&#x27;Chirality: a property of asymmetry, meaning a molecule is distinguishable from its mirror image; that is, it cannot be superimposed onto it
# Creation of Conjugated Liquid Crystalline Polymers: Dr. Shirakawa created self-oriented, conjugated liquid crystalline polymers by introducing liquid crystalline groups into the side chains of p-conjugated polymers such as polyacetylene. He also macroscopically oriented the polymers with electric or magnetic fields and succeeded in having the molecules electric anisotropy.

The general definition of electrical anisotropy describes the variation of an electrical property depending on the lateral or vertical direction (x,y,z) in which a current flows.

== Recognition ==

*2006 – Professor Emeritus of the Zhejiang University

=== The Nobel Prize ===
Shirakawa was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with UPenn&#x27;s physics professor Alan J. Heeger and chemistry professor Alan G. MacDiarmid, &quot;for the discovery and development of conductive polymers&quot;. He also became the first Japanese Nobel laureate who did not graduate from one of the National Seven Universities and the second Japanese chemistry Nobel laureate.

Over the years, Shirakawa has expressed that he does not want the Nobel Prizes to receive too much special treatment from mass media (especially the Japanese media). He hopes that many vital areas in fields outside the Nobel Prize categories will also become more widely known.

== Relatives ==
One of his relatives, Hitomi Yoshizawa, is a member of the singing group Morning Musume &quot;Morning Girls&quot;. He is also related to Naoko Takahashi, the women&#x27;s marathon gold medalist of the 2000 Summer Olympics.

== Public issues ==
On 6 December 2013, the House of Councillors (Japan) approved the bill of the State Secrecy Law. Shirakawa and physics Nobel laureate Toshihide Maskawa issued a statement saying that the law:

&quot;threatens the pacifist principles and fundamental human rights established by the constitution and should be rejected immediately&quot;...(omitted)...&quot;Even in difficult times, protecting the freedom of the press, of thought and expression and of academic research is indispensable.&quot;

==Personal life==
In the fourth season of &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, Peck was noticeably thinner. He said: &quot;I made a conscious effort to lose weight because I knew I could be happier as well as being healthier. I started by going on a diet a year and a half ago and I got a personal trainer, but I definitely have a healthier lifestyle now. Also I feel that because I do so much television, I am a better role model. I don&#x27;t really understand why I should be a role model, but I know that kids do look up to me, so it is my responsibility to motivate people and be inspiring. I hope that I can do that for kids. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what you look like though.&quot;

In June 2017, Peck married his longtime girlfriend, Paige O&#x27;Brien. In August 2018, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. Their first son was born December 29th of that year. On October 13, 2022, they welcomed their second son. On February 3 2025, Peck announced that they are expecting their third child.

Peck has named Ben Kingsley as his favorite actor, stating &quot;Nobody is as good as him in my opinion&quot;.

In 2022, Peck revealed that he had struggled with addictions to alcohol and drugs in the past, stating, &quot;I was always looking for something to fix my insides. But eventually I realized that whether my life was beyond my wildest dreams or a total mess, it didn&#x27;t change the temperature of what was going on in my mind. I knew that nothing in the outside world would make me feel whole. . . . I used food and drugs to numb my feelings.&quot; He has been sober since 2008.

<doc id="701991" wikidata="Q902336" url="?curid=701991" title="Creation and annihilation operators">
<text>Creation operators and annihilation operators are mathematical operators that have widespread applications in quantum mechanics, notably in the study of quantum harmonic oscillators and many-particle systems. An annihilation operator (usually denoted formula_1) lowers the number of particles in a given state by one. A creation operator (usually denoted formula_2) increases the number of particles in a given state by one, and it is the adjoint of the annihilation operator. In many subfields of physics and chemistry, the use of these operators instead of wavefunctions is known as second quantization. They were introduced by Paul Dirac.

Creation and annihilation operators can act on states of various types of particles. For example, in quantum chemistry and many-body theory the creation and annihilation operators often act on electron states. They can also refer specifically to the ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator. In the latter case, the creation operator is interpreted as a raising operator, adding a quantum of energy to the oscillator system (similarly for the lowering operator). They can be used to represent phonons. Constructing Hamiltonians using these operators has the advantage that the theory automatically satisfies the cluster decomposition theorem.

The mathematics for the creation and annihilation operators for bosons is the same as for the ladder operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For example, the commutator of the creation and annihilation operators that are associated with the same boson state equals one, while all other commutators vanish. However, for fermions the mathematics is different, involving anticommutators instead of commutators.

==Ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator==

In the context of the quantum harmonic oscillator, one reinterprets the ladder operators as creation and annihilation operators, adding or subtracting fixed quanta of energy to the oscillator system.

Creation/annihilation operators are different for bosons (integer spin) and fermions (half-integer spin). This is because their wavefunctions have different symmetry properties.

First consider the simpler bosonic case of the photons of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
Start with the Schrödinger equation for the one-dimensional time independent quantum harmonic oscillator,
formula_3

Make a coordinate substitution to nondimensionalize the differential equation
formula_4

The Schrödinger equation for the oscillator becomes
formula_5

Note that the quantity formula_6 is the same energy as that found for light quanta and that the parenthesis in the Hamiltonian can be written as
formula_7

The last two terms can be simplified by considering their effect on an arbitrary differentiable function formula_8

formula_9
which implies,
formula_10
coinciding with the usual canonical commutation relation formula_11, in position space representation: formula_12.

Therefore,
formula_13
and the Schrödinger equation for the oscillator becomes, with substitution of the above and rearrangement of the factor of 1/2,
formula_14

If one defines
formula_15
as the &quot;creation operator&quot; or the &quot;raising operator&quot; and
formula_16
as the &quot;annihilation operator&quot; or the &quot;lowering operator&quot;, the Schrödinger equation for the oscillator reduces to
formula_17
This is significantly simpler than the original form. Further simplifications of this equation enable one to derive all the properties listed above thus far.

Letting formula_18, where formula_19 is the nondimensionalized momentum operator
one has

formula_20
and
formula_21

Note that these imply
formula_22

The operators formula_23 and formula_24 may be contrasted to normal operators, which commute with their adjoints.

Using the commutation relations given above, the Hamiltonian operator can be expressed as
formula_25

One may compute the commutation relations between the formula_23 and formula_24 operators and the Hamiltonian:
formula_28

These relations can be used to easily find all the energy eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator as follows.

Assuming that formula_29 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian formula_30. Using these commutation relations, it follows that
formula_31

This shows that formula_32 and formula_33 are also eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, with eigenvalues formula_34 and formula_35 respectively. This identifies the operators formula_36 and formula_37 as &quot;lowering&quot; and &quot;raising&quot; operators between adjacent eigenstates. The energy difference between adjacent eigenstates is formula_38.

The ground state can be found by assuming that the lowering operator possesses a nontrivial kernel: formula_39 with formula_40. Applying the Hamiltonian to the ground state,

formula_41
So formula_42 is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian.

This gives the ground state energy formula_43, which allows one to identify the energy eigenvalue of any eigenstate formula_29 as
formula_45

Furthermore, it turns out that the first-mentioned operator in (*), the number operator formula_46 plays the most important role in applications, while the second one, formula_47 can simply be replaced by formula_48.

Consequently,
formula_49

The time-evolution operator is then
formula_50

=== Explicit eigenfunctions ===
The ground state formula_51 of the quantum harmonic oscillator can be found by imposing the condition that
formula_52

Written out as a differential equation, the wavefunction satisfies
formula_53
with the solution
formula_54

The normalization constant is found to be formula_55 from formula_56,  using the Gaussian integral. Explicit formulas for all the eigenfunctions can now be found by repeated application of formula_57 to formula_58.

=== Matrix representation ===
The matrix expression of the creation and annihilation operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator with respect to the above orthonormal basis is
formula_59

These can be obtained via the relationships formula_60 and formula_61. The eigenvectors formula_62 are those of the quantum harmonic oscillator, and are sometimes called the &quot;number basis&quot;.

== Generalized creation and annihilation operators ==


Thanks to representation theory and C*-algebras the operators derived above are actually a specific instance of a more generalized notion of creation and annihilation operators in the context of CCR and CAR algebras. Mathematically and even more generally ladder operators can be understood in the context of a root system of a semisimple Lie group and the associated semisimple Lie algebra without the need of realizing the representation as operators on a functional Hilbert space.

In the Hilbert space representation case the operators are constructed as follows: Let formula_63 be a one-particle Hilbert space (that is, any Hilbert space, viewed as representing the state of a single particle).
The (bosonic) CCR algebra over formula_63 is the algebra-with-conjugation-operator (called &quot;*&quot;) abstractly generated by elements formula_65, where formula_66ranges freely over formula_63, subject to the relations

formula_68
in bra–ket notation.

The map formula_69 from formula_63 to the bosonic CCR algebra is required to be complex antilinear (this adds more relations). Its adjoint is formula_71, and the map formula_72 is complex linear in . Thus formula_63 embeds as a complex vector subspace of its own CCR algebra. In a representation of this algebra, the element formula_65 will be realized as an annihilation operator, and formula_71 as a creation operator.

In general, the CCR algebra is infinite dimensional. If we take a Banach space completion, it becomes a C*-algebra. The CCR algebra over formula_63 is closely related to, but not identical to, a Weyl algebra.

For fermions, the (fermionic) CAR algebra over formula_63 is constructed similarly, but using anticommutator relations instead, namely

formula_78

The CAR algebra is finite dimensional only if formula_63 is finite dimensional. If we take a Banach space completion (only necessary in the infinite dimensional case), it becomes a formula_80 algebra. The CAR algebra is closely related, but not identical to, a Clifford algebra.
Physically speaking, formula_65 removes (i.e. annihilates) a particle in the state formula_82 whereas formula_71 creates a particle in the state formula_82.

The free field vacuum state is the state formula_85 with no particles, characterized by
formula_86

If formula_82 is normalized so that formula_88, then formula_89 gives the number of particles in the state formula_82.

== Creation and annihilation operators for reaction-diffusion equations ==
The annihilation and creation operator description has also been useful to analyze classical reaction diffusion equations, such as the situation when a gas of molecules formula_91 diffuse and interact on contact, forming an inert product: formula_92. To see how this kind of reaction can be described by the annihilation and creation operator formalism, consider formula_93 particles at a site on a one dimensional lattice. Each particle moves to the right or left with a certain probability, and each pair of particles at the same site annihilates each other with a certain other probability.

The probability that one particle leaves the site during the short time period &#x27; is proportional to formula_94, let us say a probability formula_95 to hop left and formula_96 to hop right. All formula_97 particles will stay put with a probability formula_98. (Since &#x27; is so short, the probability that two or more will leave during is very small and will be ignored.)

We can now describe the occupation of particles on the lattice as a &#x27;ket&#x27; of the form formula_99. It represents the juxtaposition (or conjunction, or tensor product) of the number states formula_100 formula_101, formula_102 located at the individual sites of the lattice. Recall that

formula_103
and
formula_104
for all , while
formula_105

This definition of the operators will now be changed to accommodate the &quot;non-quantum&quot; nature of this problem and we shall use the following definition:

formula_106

note that even though the behavior of the operators on the kets has been modified, these operators still obey the commutation relation
formula_107

Now define formula_108 so that it applies formula_109 to formula_110. Correspondingly, define formula_111 as applying formula_57 to formula_110. Thus, for example, the net effect of formula_114 is to move a particle from the to the -th site while multiplying with the appropriate factor.

This allows writing the pure diffusive behavior of the particles as
formula_115

The reaction term can be deduced by noting that formula_116 particles can interact in formula_117 different ways, so that the probability that a pair annihilates is formula_118, yielding a term
formula_119

where number state is replaced by number state at site formula_120 at a certain rate.

Thus the state evolves by
formula_121

Other kinds of interactions can be included in a similar manner.

This kind of notation allows the use of quantum field theoretic techniques to be used in the analysis of reaction diffusion systems.

==Creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theories==

In quantum field theories and many-body problems one works with creation and annihilation operators of quantum states, formula_122 and formula_123. These operators change the eigenvalues of the number operator,
formula_124
by one, in analogy to the harmonic oscillator. The indices (such as formula_120) represent quantum numbers that label the single-particle states of the system; hence, they are not necessarily single numbers. For example, a tuple of quantum numbers formula_126 is used to label states in the hydrogen atom.

The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators in a multiple-boson system are,
formula_127
where formula_128 is the commutator and formula_129 is the Kronecker delta.

For fermions, the commutator is replaced by the anticommutator 
formula_130
Therefore, exchanging disjoint (i.e. formula_131) operators in a product of creation or annihilation operators will reverse the sign in fermion systems, but not in boson systems.

If the states labelled by &quot;i&quot; are an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, then the result of this construction coincides with the CCR algebra and CAR algebra construction in the previous section but one. If they represent &quot;eigenvectors&quot; corresponding to the continuous spectrum of some operator, as for unbound particles in QFT, then the interpretation is more subtle.

===Normalization conventions===
While Zee obtains the momentum space normalization formula_132 via the symmetric convention for Fourier transforms, Tong and Peskin &amp; Schroeder use the common asymmetric convention to obtain formula_133. Each derives formula_134.

Srednicki additionally merges the Lorentz-invariant measure into his asymmetric Fourier measure, formula_135, yielding formula_136.

<text>The Belgrade declaration (, , , ) is a document signed by President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev on 2 June 1955 that brought about a short reconciliation between the two states. Negotiations leading up to the signing of the document took place between 27 May and 2 June.

The declaration guaranteed noninterference in Yugoslavia&#x27;s internal affairs and legitimized the right to interpret other forms of socialist development in different countries. While the declaration failed in achieving lasting rapprochement between the two countries (a result of Yugoslav anxiety over the Hungarian Revolution of 1956) it had an effect on Yugoslav disengagement from the Balkan Pact with the NATO member states of Turkey and Greece. The document was a cornerstone for the relations between the two countries for the following 35 years.

==Background==

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Tito had to choose between a more Western approach to reforms or an agreement with new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. The two countries formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Soviet ambassador Vasily Valkov arriving to Belgrade on 30 July and Yugoslav ambassador Dobrivoje Vidić arriving to Moscow on 30 September 1953 under the leadership of Georgy Malenkov. This, however, did not automatically lead to normalization between the two ruling parties. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia exchanged letters in late 1955.

Tito tried to reconcile with the Soviet Union, inviting Khrushchev to Belgrade in 1955. The Khrushchev trip to Belgrade is sometimes colloquially known as the &quot;Soviet Canossa&quot;.

This meeting resulted in the Belgrade declaration ending the Informbiro period, granting other socialist countries the right to interpret Marxism in a different way, and ensured more equal relationships amongst all satellite states and the Soviet Union. But the limits of this agreement became evident after the Soviet intervention in Hungary in October 1956; this was followed by a new Soviet campaign against Tito, which held the Yugoslav government responsible for the Hungarian insurrection. Soviet–Yugoslav relationships went through similar cool periods in the 1960s (after the violent ending of the Prague Spring and the subsequent Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia) and thereafter. Yugoslavia, however, became an associated member of the Comecon in 1964 after an agreement was reached with the Soviet leadership.

<text>Ion Gheorghe Iosif Maurer (23 September 1902 – 8 February 2000) was a Romanian communist politician and lawyer, and the 49th Prime Minister of Romania. He is the longest serving Prime Minister in the history of Romania (having served for 12 years and 343 days).

Maurer is considered one of the most effective political leaders of communist Romania; a pragmatist, during his tenure, a more nationalist form of Romanian communism was consolidated, the standard of living increased significantly, political repression was relaxed, and externally, Romania distanced itself from the USSR in favor of rapprochement with China and other third world states, but also to with states of the Western world.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Maurer was born in Bucharest to an Alsatian father of German descent and a Romanian mother with petit-bourgeois background. He completed studies in law at the University of Bucharest in 1923, after which he pursued graduate studies at the Sorbonne in Paris. Upon returning to Romania, he became an attorney, practicing law in Sighișoara, then serving as public prosecutor and later judge. In 1932 he went to Bucharest as counsel for several large banks.

The first wife was named Dana Gavrilovici, according to other sources, Lucretia. She was older than he and had two daughters with him as well as a son from her first marriage, Alexandru Niculescu, who became an officer. He remarried in 1949 to Elena (Lili) Stănescu, ex-wife of his friend N.D. Cocea and with whom he had a son, Jean Maurer, who lives in Munich. His wife died a year before his death, but fearing a heart attack his son kept this fact a secret, so Maurer died believing his wife was still alive and being treated in a hospital.

== Political career ==
He became active politically, defending in court members of the illegal leftist and Anti-fascist movements. Occasionally, as in the 1936 Craiova Trial of Romanian Communist Party (PCR) activists, including Ana Pauker, Alexandru Drăghici, and Alexandru Moghioroș, he assisted Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu.

Before 1937, he was briefly active in the Radical Peasants&#x27; Party, formed by Grigore Iunian as a splinter group of the National Peasants&#x27; Party; however, he was by then already a member of the illegal Communist Party and active in the Agitprop section. He was then tasked by the Communists to infiltrate the mainstream political parties, running for a mandate in the Chamber of Deputies in 1937 from PNL-Brătianu, and in 1938 from PNȚ.

In 1942–1943, during World War II he was imprisoned for his political activity (notably, in the Târgu Jiu internment camp), and, as a member of a paramilitary grouping, played a secondary part in the events of 23 August 1944 that led to the downfall of the Ion Antonescu regime. During this time, although present among the few active leaders of the Party around general secretary Ștefan Foriș, he became a supporter of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s faction (dominated by imprisoned activists). In 1944, he played a hand in Foriș&#x27;s deposition, assisting Emil Bodnăraș and Gheorghiu-Dej.

After the war, Maurer became a member of the Central Committee of the &quot;Romanian Workers&#x27; Party&quot; (the new name of the PCR after it had incorporated the Social Democratic Party) and took several ministerial positions in the new communist government of Romania — including that of undersecretary of the Communications and Public Works Ministry under Gheorghiu-Dej in the first Petru Groza government. In 1946-1947, he was a member of Romania&#x27;s delegation to the Paris Peace Conference (headed by Gheorghe Tătărescu) and was briefly employed by Ana Pauker at the Foreign Ministry, before being dismissed for having an unsatisfactory level of political conviction. He was removed from the forefront for the following decade, working for the Institute of Juridical Research.

He supported Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s nationalist policy, eventually becoming foreign minister of Romania in 1957 (replacing Grigore Preoteasa), holding office for six months, and serving in the delegations establishing closer contacts with the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Sino-Soviet split and a détente with France in 1959.
Regarded, according to the claims of dissident journalist , as Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s chosen successor, Maurer was head of state (President of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly of Romania) from 1958 to 1961. He took the seat previously occupied by Constantin Pîrvulescu on the Politburo, and then replaced Chivu Stoica as Prime Minister of Romania in 1961. In the latter capacity, he was the recipient of a 1963 letter by the British philosopher and activist Bertrand Russell, who pleaded with the Romanian authorities to free from jail Belu Zilber (a victim of the conflict between the Party leadership and Pătrășcanu, Zilber had been a political prisoner for sixteen years by then). Maurer was also one of three acting Chairmen of the State Council of Romania (heads of state) between March 19 and March 24, 1965.

Alongside Emil Bodnăraș, Maurer was an important member of the Politburo in opposing the ambitions of Gheorghe Apostol and, together with Bodnăraș, helping along the establishment of the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime. Among others, Maurer helped silence potential opposition from inside the Party by withdrawing his support for Corneliu Mănescu and welcoming Ceaușescu&#x27;s directives, before being himself criticized and sidelined (at the same time as his collaborator Alexandru Bârlădeanu). Pensioned in 1974, he was still present in the forefront at most Party ceremonies.

A prominent member of the nomenklatura for much of his life, he was known for his latent conflict with a large part of the PCR hierarchy. He accumulated a sizable wealth and was known for his ostentatious lifestyle. In 1989, Maurer&#x27;s earlier support for Ceaușescu led the sidelined PCR members who were planning to state their opposition to the regime by drafting the so-called Letter of the Six (Gheorghe Apostol, Alexandru Bârlădeanu, Silviu Brucan, Constantin Pîrvulescu, and Grigore Răceanu) not to enlist his assistance in the process.

== Death ==
He died in Bucharest a decade after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, leaving a son, Jean. He was 97.
