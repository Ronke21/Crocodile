<text>State Road 120 (SR 120) is a state road in the northeastern section of the state of Indiana. Running for about in a general east–west direction, connecting rural portions of Elkhart, LaGrange and Steuben counties. The western terminus is a junction with Jackson Boulevard and Middleton Run Road in Elkhart. The eastern terminus is at the Indiana–Michigan border, east of Fremont.

The modern route of SR 120 was originally just small part of a much longer Native American trail. In the early 1920s a project to construct a road replacing the Native American trail took place. SR 120 was introduced in 1937 routed along its current routing, as a state road number for Vistula Road, which was falling apart. The western end of SR 120 has been moved a couple of different times within the city of Elkhart.

==Route description==
SR 120 begins in Elkhart at the intersection of Middleton Run Road and Jackson Boulevard. It follows Jackson Boulevard, northeasterly paralleling the St. Joseph River and the Grand Elk Railroad. The road leaves the city of Elkhart and enters Elkhart County before entering the town of Bristol. In Bristol the road runs along Vistula Street and has a short concurrency with SR 15. As SR 120 leaves Bristol it crosses over the Grand Elk Railroad. East of Bristol SR 120 curves and becomes an east-west roadway, passing through rural Elkhart and LaGrange Counties, having intersections with SR 13 and SR 5. In LaGrange county the road enters the town of Howe, passing through an intersection with SR 9. After the SR 9 intersection SR 120 is concurrent with Defiance Street, until SR 120 turns south onto 3rd Street, before turning east again on Wayne Street.

East of Howe SR 120 passes north of Ontario and through an intersection with the northern end of SR 3 near Brighton. Then, upon entering Steuben County, SR 120 enters the town of Orland on Toledo Street, before having a four-way stop with SR 327. After SR 327, SR 120 leaves Orland heading northeasterly before turning easterly again, closely paralleling the Indiana Toll Road. SR 120 passes through an intersection with the northern end of SR 127, before crossing over Interstate 69. After Interstate 69, SR 120 has an entrance to the Indiana Toll Road and then passes under the toll road. SR 120 enters the town of Fremont, running along Toledo Street, having an all-way stop with the northern end of SR 827 (Wayne Street). After Fremont SR 120 passes near Clear Lake, as the road turns towards the southeast. Before the Indiana-Michigan state line SR 120 has an intersection with the former northern end of SR 1. At the Indiana-Michigan border SR 120 becomes Territorial Road, a county road in Hillsdale County, Michigan; this roadway was formerly M-120 which connected to OH-120.

==History==
The first path along part of the modern SR 120 roadway was the Vistula Trail, an old Native American trail, between Fort Duquesne and Green Bay via South Bend and the south shore of Lake Michigan. In 1922 Vistula Road was built at a cost of $87,500, . During 1930 SR 19 was proposed and accepted as a state road along modern SR 120 from Elkhart to Bristol. The second state road proposed along modern SR 120 was SR 827 from Fremont east to the Michigan/Indiana border in 1934. The right-of-way for SR 827, east of Fremont, was purchased in 1935. The following year Steuben County was having trouble maintaining the roadway, with bridges needing replacement and the gravel road surface was deteriorating. The state highway commission accepted Vistula Road as a state road in 1937 and it becomes part of SR 120. In late 1938 or early 1939 two parts of SR 120 opens to traffic with the first being between SR 13 and SR 3 and the second being throughout Steuben County. By 1941 SR 120 went between Elkhart and the Michigan state line, east of Fremont, uninterrupted. The entire roadway was paved by 1965. In late 1969 or early 1970 SR 120s western end was moved from an intersection between Middleton Run Road and US 20 (now Old US 20/Toledo Road) to an intersection between Goshen Avenue and Jackson Boulevard. The western end of SR 120 was moved once again to an intersection between Jackson Boulevard and Middleton Run Road on September 9, 2000.

At one time, State Road 120 was to have been rerouted onto Elkhart County Road 17 to end at U.S. 20.

<text>Crib Point railway station is a commuter railway station on the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of Crib Point in Victoria, Australia. Crib Point is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 17 December 1889, with the current station provided in 1986. It initially closed on 22 June 1981, then reopened on 27 September 1984.

A former freight yard was originally located opposite of the station, while a branch line and triangle into HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; was located at the up end of the station, past the Naval Base Road level crossing.

==History==

Crib Point station opened on 17 December 1889, when the railway line from Hastings was extended to Stony Point. Like the town itself, the station was named after a hut or &quot;crib&quot; was built by fishermen in the 1850s.

In 1974, flashing light signals were provided at the Naval Base Road level crossing.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the line between Long Island Junction and Stony Point also closing on the same day. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

In February 1986, the former station building, which was of a timber construction, was replaced with the current passenger shelters.

HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot; was also the location for the Mornington Railway Preservation Society, until it relocated to its current site at Moorooduc in 1997.

In 2006, No. 3 road was removed and, in October 2007, the last remaining road was removed. The removal of the roads coincided with the removal of a number of semaphore signals at the station as part of a signal upgrade on the Stony Point line.

In 2011, boom barriers were provided at the Naval Base Road level crossing.

==Platforms and services==

Crib Point has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Stony Point line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston; all stations services to Stony Point

<text>Kasey Chambers (born 4 June 1976) is an Australian country singer-songwriter and musician born in Mount Gambier to musicians Diane and Bill Chambers. Her older brother is musician and producer Nash Chambers. All four were members of family country-music group Dead Ringer Band in Bowral, New South Wales from 1992 to 1998; Chambers launched her solo career thereafter. Five of her twelve studio albums have reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot; (September 2001), &quot;Wayward Angel&quot; (May 2004), &quot;Carnival&quot; (August 2006) &quot;Rattlin&#x27; Bones&quot; (April 2008), and &quot;Dragonfly&quot; (January 2017). In November 2018 she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and has won an additional 14 ARIA Music Awards with nine for Best Country Album. Her autobiography, &quot;A Little Bird Told Me...&quot;, co-authored with music journalist Jeff Apter, was released in 2011.

==Dead Ringer Band==

Kasey Chambers was born in 1976 in Mount Gambier, South Australia to Diane and Bill Chambers. Her older brother, Nash Chambers, was born in 1974. From July 1976 the Chambers family travelled around the Nullarbor Plain, where the parents hunted foxes and rabbits for pelts during seven or eight months a year, spanning nine years. During the &quot;hot months&quot; (generally from November to March) they returned to Southend, South Australia, where her family owned a fish and chip shop for a time.

From 1986 Bill and Diane returned to performing as a country-music duo while their children attended school in Southend. In the following year their parents added first Chambers and then Nash to their act, which became the Dead Ringer Band – named for the children looking like their parents. Chambers was recorded on vocals for two albums released under Bill&#x27;s name, &quot;Sea Eagle&quot; (1987) and &quot;Kindred Spirit&quot; (1991). From 1992 Dead Ringer Band released an extended play and four albums. For their first album, &quot;Red Desert Sky&quot; (November 1993), she was named as Kasey Jo Chambers, provided vocals and wrote four of its tracks. It was co-produced by the group with Eddie Sikorski at John Reynolds Recording Studio, Adelaide.

Chambers met fellow country singer-songwriter Beccy Cole in mid-1989 in Adelaide, and she joined Dead Ringer Band on a tour through New South Wales before going solo. Chambers later recalled, &quot;I never really met anyone at this point in my life that was of the same generation as me – a young girl who liked country music. And funnily enough the first song that I ever wrote in my life was called &#x27;Beccy&#x27;, about Beccy. It&#x27;s the worst song you&#x27;ve ever heard in your whole life.&quot; She cited Emmylou Harris as one of her primary influences, recalling that her parents had frequently Harris&#x27; music throughout her childhood. The group ended when Chambers&#x27; parents divorced in the late 1990s, Diane moved to Norfolk Island, and Bill moved to Sydney.

==Solo career==
===1998–2002: &quot;The Captain&quot; to &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot;===
Chambers recorded her debut solo album, &quot;The Captain&quot;, on Norfolk Island during July and August 1998 with her brother Nash producing and father Bill on guitar. United States country musicians, Buddy and Julie Miller added guitars and vocals to four tracks. &quot;The Captain&quot; was released in May 1999 via EMI Music Australia and in June 2000 in the US by Asylum Records. It peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 1 on the related ARIA Country Albums chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 she won Best Country Album and in the following year she won Best Female Artist for its title track, which was issued in 2000.

&quot;The Captain&quot; was certified double platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in 2001. It reached the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums in 2001. She toured the US as a support act to Lucinda Williams and later supported Emmylou Harris on the Australian leg of that artist&#x27;s tour. &quot;The Captain&quot; was played in episode 8 (&quot;He Is Risen&quot;) of the third season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, in April 2001.

Chambers&#x27; second studio album, &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot;, was released in September 2001 via EMI Music, which was also produced by Nash. It debuted at No. 4 in the ARIA Albums Chart and peaked at No. 1 in February of the following year. Its third single, &quot;Not Pretty Enough&quot; (January 2002), also peaked at No. 1 on the related ARIA Singles Chart in the same month. The track was written by Chambers and according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;[it&#x27;s] about being ignored by commercial radio.&quot; He cited her autobiography, &quot;A Little Bird Told Me&quot; (2011), &quot;&#x27;I wrote [it] as a song about feeling invisible... it was obvious that out in the music industry there was only one path for most young women – over-sexualised and over made up. To succeed you needed to look like Britney or Shakira.&quot;

She is the first Australian country music artist to have simultaneous No. 1 single and album. Subsequent singles &quot;Million Tears&quot; (June 2002) and &quot;If I Were You&quot; (October) also made the top 40. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 she won three categories, Album of the Year, Best Female Artist and Best Country Album, for &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot;. It was certified seven times platinum in 2003 for shipment of at least 490,000 copies. In February 2002 it was released in the US, which peaked at No. 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, topping the related Heatseeker Chart and reaching the top 20 of their country music chart. It received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to aggregate site, Metacritic, with a rating of 74% from 12 critics.

Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll compared it to her first album, &quot;The musical cast remains essentially the same as &quot;The Captain&quot; with the addition of a &#x27;rock&#x27; component via drummer Peter Luscombe and rhythm guitarist Dave Steel, and a guest appearance from &#x27;punkabilly&#x27; band the Living End. The album also features appearances from Paul Kelly and American country&#x27;s Lucinda Williams.&quot; Nimmervoll cited Chambers&#x27; observation, &quot;The last album showed my life story. That was Introducing Kasey Chambers. This one&#x27;s The Many Moods of Kasey Chambers.&quot;

===2003–2007: &quot;Wayward Angel&quot; to &quot;Carnival&quot;===
Chambers recorded a cover version of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;True Colours&quot; (April 2003), which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was used as the theme song for the Rugby World Cup in that year. Her rendition reached No. 76 on the End of Year Top 100 Singles for 2003, and was certified as a gold record for shipment of 35,000. At the APRA Music Awards of 2003 Chambers won three categories with &quot;Not Pretty Enough&quot; named as Song of the Year, Most Performed Australian Work and Most Performed Country Work.

She released her third solo album, &quot;Wayward Angel&quot;, in May 2004, which debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained at the top position for five weeks. It was accredited triple platinum for shipment of 210,000 copies by the end of the following year. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming felt, &quot;[it] is perhaps a bit less striking than her first two sets, &quot;The Captain&quot; and &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot;, if only because she staked out her style on those sessions, and here she&#x27;s harvesting from the ground she broke earlier on. But this also sounds like her most accomplished effort to date.&quot;

Singles from the album include &quot;Hollywood&quot; (August 2004), &quot;Pony&quot; (January 2005), and &quot;Saturated&quot; (May). Following the Boxing Day Tsunami (26 December 2004), Chambers appeared at the Wave Aid charity concert in Sydney in January 2005, to help raise funds for organisations in disaster affected areas. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 she won both Best Female Artist and Best Country Album for &quot;Wayward Angel&quot;.

Chambers&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Carnival&quot; (August 2006), also debuted at No. 1. Deming found, &quot;[it] is roots-friendly enough that it isn&#x27;t likely to seriously alienate most of her fans, this album does represent a clear and decisive break from the country-influenced approach of her earlier music; most of these 12 songs are easygoing but satisfying roots rock with a bluesy undertone... As a songwriter, she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives (love, lust, disappointment, getting on with life) with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail, and if anything, the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes.&quot; Its lead single, &quot;Nothing at All&quot; (July), reached the top ten.

===2008–2010: &quot;Rattlin&#x27; Bones&quot; to &quot;Little Bird&quot;===

In April 2008 Chambers issued her first collaboration album, &quot;Rattlin&#x27; Bones&quot;, with her then-husband Shane Nicholson, which was co-produced by Nash and Nicholson. It debuted at No. 1 and was certified platinum for 70,000 shipments by that year&#x27;s end. Frank Gutch Jnr of &quot;No Depression&quot; felt, &quot;[it] could be the soundtrack of the Old West, or themes from the old mountain lifestyle. They have it down, from the sparing use of mandolin and the at times Everly Brothers harmonies to the dirt-beneath-the-fingernails aura. This music is American. Except that it&#x27;s Australian. It&#x27;s a conundrum.&quot;

Chambers and Nicholson were joined by fellow country musician, Troy Cassar-Daley, to perform at Sound Relief, in March 2009, which was a benefit concert in support of survivors of the February 2009 Victorian bushfires. It was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, simultaneously with another concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Appearing with Chambers in Melbourne were Augie March, Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Jack Johnson, Jet, Kings of Leon, Liam Finn, Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Split Enz, and Wolfmother.

During 2009 Chambers collaborated with Bill, Nash and family members to release a children&#x27;s music album, &quot;Kasey Chambers, Poppa Bill and the Little Hillbillies&quot; (November 2009). In 2010 it won the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for Best Independent Country Album. As part of that project she also co-wrote a children&#x27;s story, &quot;Little Kasey Chambers and the Lost Music&quot; (2009), with Bernadette Werchon.

Chambers&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Little Bird&quot;, appeared in September 2010 via Liberation Music, which peaked at No. 3. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Jonathan Keefe rated it as four-out-of-five stars and explained, &quot;[it] is a polished, studio-slick record of pop-country whose songs are catchy as all hell... It&#x27;s the economy of [her] songwriting that has been the source of the comparisons between her work and that of [Lucinda] Williams, and Chambers&#x27;s deep understanding of song structure allows her to create real emotional complexity from just a few turns of phrase.&quot; It won Best Country Album at the ARIA Awards in 2011.

===2011–2013: &quot;Storybook&quot; to &quot;Wreck &amp; Ruin&quot;===
&quot;Storybook&quot;, Chambers next studio album, was released in September 2011 and consists of cover versions of other artists material, which peaked at No. 21. &quot;No Surf Music&quot;″s Jason D Hamad described how, &quot;because of its very nature I can&#x27;t say that this album breaks any new ground. Still, it does justice to Chambers&#x27; sometimes-eclectic influences and adds an additional layer of understanding for her fans.&quot;

Her single from the album, &quot;Luka&quot; (2011), is a rendition of Susan Vega&#x27;s original from 1987. Hamad discussed how, &quot;[she] strips away the 80&#x27;s synth-pop, replacing it with more traditional instrumentation including a prominent, bouncing bass, but keeps the airy musical feel meant to contrast with the dark tone of the lyrics.&quot; Her autobiography, &quot;A Little Bird Told Me...&quot;, was co-authored with music journalist, Jeff Apter, and was issued later that year.

Her second collaboration with Nicholson, &quot;Wreck &amp; Ruin&quot; (September 2012), reached No. 6 and provided another ARIA Award for Best Country Album in the next year. Keefe found the album has, &quot;the married couple layering intricate vocal harmonies over some casual, mostly acoustic country-rock... Though [it] impresses for its thematic focus and gallows humor, the economy of language in the songwriting occasionally scans as a bit pedestrian.&quot;

On 23 April 2013, it was announced that Nicholson and Kasey Chambers had separated, their split forced by the collision of work and family life.

===2014–2018: &quot;Bittersweet&quot; to &quot;Campfire&quot;===

Chambers&#x27; tenth studio album, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, appeared in August 2014, which peaked at No. 2. It was produced by Nick DiDia – her first album which was not produced by her brother, Nash. Deming felt, &quot;[she] has written a set of songs that are unpretentiously intelligent but deal with matters of the heart and soul with unrelenting honesty, and her rough, sweet vocals never deliver anything short of the ring of truth. [It] is a strong, satisfying album from one of the best and most distinctive singer/songwriters of her day, and this confirms she can move in any number of different directions and still offer her listeners something remarkable.&quot;

It was also recorded after her marital split from Nicholson the previous year. &quot;The Music&quot;″s Chris Familton observed, &quot;It finds her canvassing a range of styles and moods, often with religious/biblical references, without sacrificing her heart-on-sleeve emotiveness, innate sense of melody and country heart.&quot; The title track is a duet with Bernard Fanning (ex-Powderfinger), which Familton found, &quot;sways with a Neil Young looseness that works surprisingly well.&quot; It won Best Country Album at the ARIA Music Awards of 2014.

In late 2015 she covered the track, &quot;Cold and Bitter Tears&quot;, on a tribute album for US soul blues musician, Ted Hawkins, &quot;Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins&quot;, which was released on Eight 30 Records in Austin, Texas. She was joined on the track by Bill and explained, &quot;My dad called me up one day and told me about the project... We recorded it at my dad&#x27;s house, sitting around jamming around a mike. It was a really special thing. I play with my dad all the time, but the novelty never wears off. I love the combination that we create together.&quot;

&quot;Dragonfly&quot;, her eleventh studio album, appeared in January 2017 and reached No. 1. It is a double album with Nash producing one session at his Foggy Mountain studio and Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly producing another session at Sing Sing Studios, Melbourne. She followed with a US tour in mid-year. Besides duetting on a track with Kelly, she also sings on a track each with Ed Sheeran, Keith Urban and Foy Vance.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Australia&#x27;s Gareth Hipwell observed, &quot;[she] has always tended to eschew the more reticent course of songwriting from a point of abstraction, consistently wearing her profoundest truths and uncertainties on her sleeve. It&#x27;s an artistic penchant given full flight on free-ranging double-LP &quot;Dragonfly&quot;: &#x27;Talkin&#x27; Baby Blues&#x27;, a shot of Woody Guthriesque spoken-word acoustica, is itself a stunningly candid retelling of Chambers&#x27; storied life to date.&quot; Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; rated it at three-and-a-half stars out-of five and explained, &quot;[it] serves as a summation of sorts of the singer&#x27;s entire career, a comprehensive, double-album opus that effortlessly switches between Appalachian mountain music, slow-burning folk-rock, melodic radio-pop, Woody Guthrie talking blues, and celebratory country-gospel.&quot; At the ARIA Music Awards of 2017 she won her eighth Best Country Album trophy, for &quot;Dragonfly&quot;.

Chambers twelfth studio album, &quot;Campfire&quot; (April 2018), is a collaboration with the Fireside Disciples, an &quot;ad hoc acoustic ensemble&quot;, comprising Bill on dobro, Brandon Dodd on acoustic guitar, and Alan Pigram on mandolin (and vocals on the album&#x27;s lead track). It peaked at No. 6 and was co-produced by Chambers, Bill, Dodd, Pigram, and Jordan Power. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018 Chambers became the youngest solo female artist to be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, as well as winning the Best Country Album category for a record ninth time. At the Australian Country Music Awards of 2019, &quot;Campfire&quot; won Traditional Country Album of the Year.

===2024: &quot;Backbone&quot;===
In July 2024, Chambers announced her thirteenth studio album &quot;Backbone&quot;, released in October, and book &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Be a D**khead&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 2000 Kasey Chambers&#x27; domestic partner was Cori Hopper, a Perth-born actor, film and music video maker, later based in Sydney. Their son Talon was born in 2002; they separated in November 2004. Hopper was a presenter on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; from January to December of that year and was a regular cast member on &quot;The Wedge&quot; during 2006.

On 17 December 2005, Chambers married fellow country music singer-songwriter Shane Nicholson. Chambers had sung a duet, &quot;Designed to Fade&quot;, with Nicholson on his debut solo album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Movie&quot; (2002), which was produced by Nash Chambers. Subsequently, they co-released two albums, &quot;Rattlin&#x27; Bones&quot; (2008) and &quot;Wreck &amp; Ruin&quot; (2012). Their son Arlo Ray was born in 2007, followed by daughter Poet Poppin in 2011. In April 2013 the couple announced their separation. In 2024, they recorded &quot;The Divorce Song&quot;, which appeared on Chambers&#x27; album &quot;Backbone&quot;.
At age 30 Chambers was diagnosed with an eating disorder, a combination of bulimia and anorexia nervosa. She explained, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t feel myself and I knew that something wasn&#x27;t right [...] It wasn&#x27;t an image thing for me ... It wasn&#x27;t &#x27;Oh I look fat in photos&#x27;. It was more about the control thing.&quot; She was treated by a psychologist and &quot;MammaMia&quot;″s Jessie Stephens, observed, &quot;she recognises the importance of accepting that it might be a bad day, or a bad week, and negativity is a vital part of living a balanced life. Pushing it away can lead to anxieties manifesting in a different, more debilitating way.&quot;

In her autobiography, &quot;A Little Bird Told Me...&quot; (2011), Chambers provided, &quot;a disarmingly honest account of a remarkable talent.&quot; &quot;The Herald Sun&quot;″s Corinna Hente observed, &quot;Despite all the success, tragedy struck through a miscarriage, a broken relationship, anorexia and a breakdown. She rebuilt her life with music, playing covers with her family in a band called the Lost Dogs at the local pub.&quot; She described one of their gigs from July 2007, &quot;it&#x27;s not the best idea to get up and sing with a band when you&#x27;re nine months pregnant, 10 days overdue and bigger than a barn, but there was something about my gigs with the Lost Dogs band that I found impossible to resist. They were a reminder of why I&#x27;d fallen in love with music in the first place.&quot;

Chambers was raised in the Seventh-day Adventist Church by her parents. After releasing her single, &quot;Is God Real?&quot; (April 2015), she described her beliefs, &quot;It is a very personal thing, which is probably why we don&#x27;t talk about it, but I don&#x27;t think that means we shouldn&#x27;t... For me, I certainly believe in a higher power. I don&#x27;t have a yes or no answer. I have some sort of belief there, but it has changed a lot over the years.&quot; As of November 2018 she lives in Copacabana, New South Wales Central Coast.

<text>Stony Point railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Stony Point line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the town of Crib Point in Victoria, Australia. Stony Point is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 17 December 1889, with the current station provided in 1984. It initially closed on 10 June 1981, then reopened on 27 September 1984.

== History ==
In 1910, a turntable was provided at the station. By November 1960, it was out of use and, by March 1963, was abolished.

In 1976, a siding at the up end of the station was removed. The following year, in 1977, the goods yard was closed.

On 22 June 1981, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point was withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the line between Long Island Junction and Stony Point also closing on the same day. On 16 September 1984, promotional trips for the reopening of the line began and, on 27 September of that year, the passenger service was reinstated.

A run-around loop exists to the north and west of the station, but has not been regularly used since locomotive hauled services ceased in April 2008.

In June 2014, the platform length was reduced from around 150 metres to 103 metres. This was done as the extra length used for longer locomotives was no longer required.

==Platforms and services==

Stony Point has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Stony Point line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Frankston

==Transport links==
A jetty is located near the station, from which ferry services operate to Tankerton, on French Island, and Cowes, on Phillip Island.

<doc id="709019" wikidata="Q159607" url="?curid=709019" title="Jovibarba">
<text>Jovibarba (&quot;beard of Jupiter&quot;) is a small genus of three species of succulent flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, endemic to mountainous regions in the southeastern quadrant of Europe. The genus is sometimes classified as a subgenus of &quot;Sempervivum&quot;, to which it is closely related. &quot;Jovibarba&quot; have pale-greenish-yellow or yellow actinomorphic flowers with about six petals, while &quot;Sempervivum&quot; have generally pinkish flowers with around twice as many petals, which open more widely than jovibarba flowers. The common name hen and chicks is applied to some &quot;Jovibarba&quot; species (and also species in several other genera).

Most jovibarbas, like sempervivums, reproduce via offsets in addition to producing seeds via sexual reproduction. &quot;Jovibarba heuffelii&quot; does not produce offsets on stolons. Instead the offspring of this plant are produced within the mother plant. To propagate it must be split with a knife. The other two jovibarba species are commonly called rollers. They produce offsets that are lightly attached and easily pop off and roll away from the mother plant. Offsets survive the main rosette, which is monocarpic.

==Species==
Only three species are accepted as distinct by the &quot;Flora Europaea&quot;:
*&quot;Jovibarba globifera&quot; (syn. &quot;J. sobolifera&quot;; &quot;Sempervivum globiferum&quot;)
*&quot;Jovibarba heuffelii&quot; (syn. &quot;J. velenovskyi&quot;; &quot;Sempervivum heuffelii&quot;)
*&quot;Jovibarba hirta&quot; (syn. &quot;Sempervivum hirtum&quot;)

&quot;Jovibarba globifera&quot; and its subspecies (subsp. &quot;hirtum&quot;, subsp. &quot;allionii&quot;, subsp. &quot;arenaria&quot;) live in the eastern and southern Alps, the Carpathians and the western Balkans south to northern Albania. &quot;J. heuffelii&quot; occurs in the remainder of the Balkans and the eastern Carpathians, southeast of &quot;J. globifera&quot;. &quot;J. hirta&quot; occurs further west, in the southwestern Alps.

<text>Ardeer railway station is a regional railway station on the Ararat line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the western suburb of Ardeer, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ardeer station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform with two sides. It opened on 2 April 1929, with the current station provided in 1977. It was originally closed on 28 August 1956, then was reopened on 2 May 1977.

==History==
===1903-1956===
In 1903, the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company Siding was provided on the north side of the line, near what would become the site of Ardeer station. In 1910, a connection to the siding was added at the Melbourne (up) end, converting it into a loop, and it was renamed the Federal Manure Siding. In 1929, it was renamed again as Nobel (Australasia) Pty Ltd Chemical Siding.

On 2 April 1929, the station opened, coinciding with the introduction of a passenger service for factory workers at Ardeer and Deer Park. The loop siding was to the east of the former Fitzgerald Road level crossing, and the platform was to the west of it, on the north side of the line. In 1934, it was renamed Ardeer Siding. On 28 August 1956, the station was closed and the passenger platform removed.

===1976-present===
In 1976, the line through the section of the former station was duplicated from Sunshine to Deer Park West Junction. On 2 May 1977, the current Ardeer station opened, with an island platform being provided at the up end of the existing siding, about 800 metres further east than the former station. In 1981, the Nobel (Australasia) Pty Ltd Siding was renamed ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd Siding and, in 1990, was abolished.

As part of the Regional Rail Link project, the station underwent a minor platform upgrade. Noise walls were also installed along the corridor, and safety gates were provided at nearby pedestrian crossings.

First announced by the Andrews State Government in 2018, the station is set to be integrated into the metropolitan railway network, as part of the Western Rail Plan.

==Platforms and services==

Ardeer has one island platform with two faces. It is served by V/Line Ballarat and Ararat line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross

<text>Deer Park railway station is a regional railway station on the Ararat and Warrnambool lines, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the western suburb of Deer Park, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Deer Park station is an elevated premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 2 April 1884, with the current station provided in 2023.

Initially opened as Kororoit, the station was given its current name of Deer Park on 3 December 1889.

==History==

Deer Park station opened as Kororoit on 2 April 1884, along with the Serviceton line, and was renamed Deer Park in 1899, by which time the station had a three road yard, passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an interlocked signal box. Being on a single track railway, it served as a crossing loop for trains, which remained until 1913, when the signal box was abolished.

In 1928, a siding serving Nobel Chemical Finishes (Australia) Pty Ltd was provided at the up (Spencer Street) end of the station, running north to a loop siding and dead end. In 1929, alterations were made to the electric staff working of trains, to permit workers trains to operate to the Nobel factories at Ardeer and Deer Park. In 1943, the signal box was reopened, in conjunction with the opening of the new Ravenhall siding (Commonwealth Government Siding), at the down end of the yard. The new siding ran south from the line to a loop siding, before terminating at a dead end. Also occurring in that year, flashing light signals were provided at the former Mount Derrimut Road level crossing (then known as Station Road), which was located at the up end of the station.

The Nobel siding (later ICIANZ) was closed in 1955 and, in 1976, the line from Sunshine to Deer Park West Junction was duplicated, with the current island platform also provided. The signal box was closed, and the line was worked by Centralised Traffic Control from Sunshine. Crossovers between both lines were provided at each end of the platform. In 1978, the Ravenhall siding was abolished.

In 1981, boom barriers were provided at the former Mount Derrimut Road level crossing. In 1987, one of the loop sidings in the yard was removed, with the last siding removed in 1989, leaving only the main line and platform. In 2005, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, control of the signalling was transferred to the Ballarat signal box.

In September 2009, an upgrade of Deer Park station commenced, including:
* 150 paved car-parking spaces;
* improved station access, lighting and signage;
* improved station security via CCTV;
* retain as many trees as possible, as well as planting new trees;
* protect native grasses to the east of the new car park.

In June 2015, the junction of the Deer Park – West Werribee line, part of the Regional Rail Link project, opened three kilometres west of Deer Park. The year prior, during major construction works, the station underwent a minor upgrade as part of the project. There were changes to the platform and the car-park, and safety fences were installed between the tracks and the car-park waiting area.

First announced by the Andrews State Government in 2018, the station is set to be integrated into the metropolitan railway network, as part of the Western Rail Plan.

As part of the Regional Rail Revival project, of track was duplicated between Deer Park West and Melton. It was provided in late 2019, coinciding with the opening of Cobblebank.

As part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, the Mount Derrimut Road level crossing was grade separated and the station rebuilt in April 2023. The railway line was elevated over the road, along with the rebuilt station. Construction began in 2021, with the station and adjacent road reopening on 24 April 2023.
Deer Park is also the first station in Victoria to have a roof garden

<text>Rockbank railway station is a regional railway station on the Ararat line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the western suburb of Rockbank, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Rockbank station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 2 April 1884, with the current station provided in 2019.

Initially opened as Mount Atkinson, the station was given its current name of Rockbank in November 1889.

==History==
The station opened as Mount Atkinson on 2 April 1884, at the same time as the Serviceton line through it, and was renamed Rockbank in 1889. Being on a single track railway line, it provided a crossing loop for trains, and continued to do so until 2019. By 1914, it had a three-road yard, a passenger platform on the southern track, a goods platform on the northern track, and an interlocked signal box. The station served the local farming community. With a chaff mill established in the 1890s, and the recreation reserve and tennis club located nearby, the station became the focus of the Rockbank community.

In 1960, the crossing loop was extended for longer trains of up to 730 metres, and a short platform was provided on the loop road. In 1976, Centralised Traffic Control was provided on the line from Sunshine to Rockbank. Also in that year, flashing light signals were provided at the Leakes Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station. By the 1970s, the mill was disused, and the station building was demolished circa 1985. In 1986, the yard was rationalised to a main line and crossing loop and, in 1990, the mechanical signals and points were removed, and replaced by remotely controlled signalling, operated from the Bacchus Marsh signal box. The former northern platform (was Platform 2, now Platform 1) was not provided until 1992, replacing the former short platform.

In 2002, boom barriers were provided at the Leakes Road level crossing. In 2005, control of the signals was transferred to the Ballarat signal box, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

In March 2018, as part of the Regional Rail Revival project, work began on the reconstruction of the station. The two side platforms were completely rebuilt to fit six-carriage VLocity trains, and an accessible pedestrian overpass was installed over the tracks, accessed by lifts, ramps and stairs. The upgraded station had a new sealed car park for over 350 cars, new bus and taxi bays, secure bike storage areas, and drop-off zones. On 26 August 2019, the rebuilt station was opened to passengers. The project also involved 18 km of duplication of track between Deer Park West and Melton. It was provided in late 2019, coinciding with the opening of Cobblebank.

First announced by the Andrews State Government in 2018, the station is set to be integrated into the metropolitan railway network, as part of the Western Rail Plan.

<text>Melton railway station is a regional railway station on the Ararat line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the outer-western suburb of Melton South, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Melton Station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 2 April 1884.

The station is planned to be rebuilt by 2026 as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
Melton Station opened when the railway line from Braybrook Junction (Sunshine) was extended to the town. Like the town itself, the station was named after Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, England. 

In 1886, the line was extended westward to Parwan and, being on a single track section, the station was the site of a crossing loop from that time. By 1889, the station had an interlocked signal box, single passenger platform, and a three-track yard. There was a goods shed opposite the passenger platform.

=== 20th century ===
In 1962, flashing light signals were provided at the Exford Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction from the station. In 1987, the yard was rationalised, being reduced to a main line and crossing loop. Boom barriers were provided in 1990, and a second platform was added in 1991. In 1998, the station building was refurbished.

=== 21st century ===
In 2005, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, control of the signals was transferred to the Ballarat signal box. The station retains the lever frame for historical purposes.

As part of the Regional Rail Revival project, 18 km of track was duplicated between the Deer Park West junction and Melton. The duplication was completed in late 2019, coinciding with the opening of the newly-built Cobblebank Station.

=== Future ===
On 6 October 2022, the Andrews Government announced that four level crossings will be removed in Melton and Truganina by the Level Crossing Removal Project. As part of these removals, Melton Station will be rebuilt by 2026. 

Throughout 2024, concept designs for the new Melton Station were released. The rebuilt station will include four platforms; Platforms 2 and 3 as an island platform with two faces, and Platforms 1 and 4 as side platforms. The platforms will be long enough to accommodate 9-carriage V/Line VLocity DMUs in the future, set to be introduced to the line by 2028.

Electrification and quadruplication of the Ararat line up to Melton was announced by the Andrews Government as part of the Western Rail Plan. In 2023, it was reported that quadruplication of the line had been cut, and there is no current plan to electrify the line.

==Platforms and services==
Melton has two side platforms. It is served by V/Line Ballarat and Ararat line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross
* services to Southern Cross
* one daily service to Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Bacchus Marsh and Wendouree
* services to Ararat

<text>In quantum field theory, the term moduli (: modulus; more properly moduli fields) is sometimes used to refer to scalar fields whose potential energy function has continuous families of global minima. Such potential functions frequently occur in supersymmetric systems. The term &quot;modulus&quot; is borrowed from mathematics (or more specifically, moduli space is borrowed from algebraic geometry), where it is used synonymously with &quot;parameter&quot;. The word moduli (&quot;Moduln&quot; in German) first appeared in 1857 in Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s celebrated paper &quot;Theorie der Abel&#x27;schen Functionen&quot;.

== Moduli spaces in quantum field theories ==

In quantum field theories, the possible vacua are usually labeled by the vacuum expectation values of scalar fields, as Lorentz invariance forces the vacuum expectation values of any higher spin fields to vanish. These vacuum expectation values can take any value for which the potential function is a minimum. Consequently, when the potential function has continuous families of global minima, the space of vacua for the quantum field theory is a manifold (or orbifold), usually called the vacuum manifold. This manifold is often called the moduli space of vacua, or just the moduli space, for short.

The term moduli is also used in string theory to refer to various continuous parameters that label possible string backgrounds: the expectation value of the dilaton field, the parameters (e.g. the radius and complex structure) which govern the shape of the compactification manifold, et cetera. These parameters are represented, in the quantum field theory that approximates the string theory at low energies, by the vacuum expectation values of massless scalar fields, making contact with the usage described above. In string theory, the term &quot;moduli space&quot; is often used specifically to refer to the space of all possible string backgrounds.

==Moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories==
In general quantum field theories, even if the classical potential energy is minimized over a large set of possible expectation values, once quantum corrections are included it is generically the case that nearly all of these configurations cease to minimize the energy. The result is that the set of vacua of the quantum theory is generally much smaller than that of the classical theory. A notable exception occurs when the various vacua in question are related by a symmetry which guarantees that their energy levels remain exactly degenerate.

The situation is very different in supersymmetric quantum field theories. In general, these possess large moduli spaces of vacua which are not related by any symmetry, for example, the masses of the various excitations may differ at various points on the moduli space. The moduli spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories are in general easier to calculate than those of nonsupersymmetric theories because supersymmetry restricts the allowed geometries of the moduli space even when quantum corrections are included.

===Allowed moduli spaces of 4-dimensional theories===
The more supersymmetry there is, the stronger the restriction on the vacuum manifold. Therefore, if a restriction appears below for a given number N of spinors of supercharges, then it also holds for all greater values of N.

====N=1 Theories====

The first restriction on the geometry of a moduli space was found in 1979 by Bruno Zumino and published in the article &quot;Supersymmetry and Kähler Manifolds&quot;. He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry. N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single Majorana supercharge. The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the chiral superfields. He found that the vacuum manifold of allowed vacuum expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a Kähler manifold.

If gravity is included in the theory, so that there is local supersymmetry, then the resulting theory is called a supergravity theory and the restriction on the geometry of the moduli space becomes stronger. The moduli space must not only be Kähler, but also the Kähler form must lift to integral cohomology. Such manifolds are called Hodge manifolds. The first example appeared in the 1979 article &quot;Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Higgs Effect in Supergravity Without Cosmological Constant&quot; and the general statement appeared 3 years later in &quot;Quantization of Newton&#x27;s Constant in Certain Supergravity Theories&quot;.

====N=2 Theories====

In extended 4-dimensional theories with N=2 supersymmetry, corresponding to a single Dirac spinor supercharge, the conditions are stronger. The N=2 supersymmetry algebra contains two representations with scalars, the vector multiplet which contains a complex scalar and the hypermultiplet which contains two complex scalars. The moduli space of the vector multiplets is called the Coulomb branch while that of the hypermultiplets is called the Higgs branch. The total moduli space is locally a product of these two branches, as nonrenormalization theorems imply that the metric of each is independent of the fields of the other multiplet.(See for example Argyres, Non-Perturbative Dynamics Of Four-Dimensional Supersymmetric Field Theories, pp. 6–7, for further discussion of the local product structure.)

In the case of global N=2 supersymmetry, in other words in the absence of gravity, the Coulomb branch of the moduli space is a special Kähler manifold. The first example of this restriction appeared in the 1984 article Potentials and Symmetries of General Gauged N=2 Supergravity: Yang-Mills Models by Bernard de Wit and Antoine Van Proeyen, while a general geometric description of the underlying geometry, called special geometry, was presented by Andrew Strominger in his 1990 paper Special Geometry.

The Higgs branch is a hyperkähler manifold as was shown by Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Daniel Freedman in their 1981 paper Geometrical Structure and Ultraviolet Finiteness in the Supersymmetric Sigma Model. Including gravity the supersymmetry becomes local. Then one needs to add the same Hodge condition to the special Kahler Coulomb branch as in the N=1 case. Jonathan Bagger and Edward Witten demonstrated in their 1982 paper Matter Couplings in N=2 Supergravity that in this case, the Higgs branch must be a quaternionic Kähler manifold.

====N&gt;2 Supersymmetry====

In extended supergravities with N&gt;2 the moduli space must always be a symmetric space.

<doc id="709031" wikidata="Q1412181" url="?curid=709031" title="Graz School">
<text>The Graz School (), also Meinong&#x27;s School, of experimental psychology and object theory was headed by Alexius Meinong, who was professor and Chair of Philosophy at the University of Graz where he founded the Graz Psychological Institute (Grazer Psychologische Institut) in 1894. The Graz School&#x27;s phenomenological psychology and philosophical semantics achieved important advances in philosophy and psychological science.

==History==
Meinong developed the Graz School with the assistance of his students Christian von Ehrenfels (founder of &quot;Gestalt&quot; psychology) and Alois Höfler. The growth of his theory, however, occurred later when he started teaching and conducted research at Graz where he received contributions from students who also later became his philosophical successors. Meinong and these proteges – particularly their work on phenomenological psychology and philosophical semantics – gained advances in all major areas of philosophy and psychological science. Among Meinong&#x27;s pupils were Fritz Heider, Stephan Witasek, Vittorio Benussi, Rudolf Ameseder, Konrad Zindler, Wilhelm Maria Frankl, Eduard Martinak, Ernst Mally, Steno Tedeschi, and Franz Weber. Meinong&#x27;s earlier students, von Ehrenfels (founder of &quot;Gestalt&quot; psychology), Höfler, Adalbert Meingast, and Anton Oelzelt-Newin, can be considered part of this school. The assistance of these students allowed Meinong to further refine his theories such as object theory.

The Graz School also played an important role in Gestalt theory as Meniong&#x27;s model of cognition became an important research foundation for Gestalt perception. The Graz School was part of the wider movement of Austrian realism.

== Theories ==
The Graz School developed much of Meinongs theories that covered various topics such as philosophical psychology, metaphysics, semantics and philosophy of language, theory of evidence, possibility and probability, and value theory as well as the analysis of emotion, imagination and abstraction. The School is known for its object theory and theory of the mind. An important foundation of the Graz School is Meinong&#x27;s position that psychology is part of philosophy where the former (particularly descriptive psychology) is considered the fundamental discipline while the latter represents &quot;a whole group of sciences&quot;. It also embraced the Brentano&#x27;s ideas such as the empiricist methodology for scientific philosophy, the intentionality thesis, and the goal of developing an intentionalist philosophy of fact and value. 

=== Object theory ===
The object theory of the Graz School first emerged in Meinong&#x27;s work, &quot;On Assumptions&quot;, published in 1902. 

=== Aesthetics ===
It is recognized that Witasek and Benussi assisted Meinong in his philosophical investigations and had contributed to the development of the Graz School. The development of the concept of aesthetic value in the Graz School is attributed to Witasek. Meinong&#x27;s himself did not focus on this area in his investigations despite his interest in the arts. The subject was discussed in a 400-page book called &quot;Grundzuge der allgemeinen Asthetik&quot;, which addressed – according to the Meinongian framework – the problems that an aesthetic theory is expected to deal with during its time. This included the evaluation of the Meinongian theory of aesthetic enjoyment and its link to the psychology of the sense experience of aesthetic objects.

<text>State Road 127 (SR 127) is a short north–south highway in northeast corner of the U.S. state of Indiana between U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Angola, Indiana and SR 120. Its present length was formerly a part of old US 27, whose designation was moved to the new Interstate 69 (I–69) when the freeway was completed in northern Indiana in 1967.

SR 127 is in fact a &quot;child&quot; of US 27; however, Indiana decommissioned all of US 27 north of Fort Wayne, so SR 127 no longer connects with US 27 anywhere. It functions in part to connect SR 120 to I–69 and, south of its interchange with I–69, it provides a local thoroughfare into Angola. The last several miles of SR 127 north of Angola&#x27;s town square are crowded with fast-food franchises and other national chains.

SR 127 also provides access, through the very short SR 727, to Pokagon State Park.

==Route description==
SR 127 southern terminus is at US 20. SR 127 heads north as a two–lane highway passing through residential areas. At Calvary Lane in Angola the road becomes a four–lane highway with a center turn lane. At 200 North the road becomes a two–lane rural highway, passing farmland and woodlands. North of Angola, SR 127 has an interchange with Interstate 69 (I-69). Where SR 127 passes under I-69 heading west then at an intersection with SR 727, SR 127 turns north. After SR 727, SR 127 is within a few hundred yards from I-69.

==History==

SR 127 was first authorized in 1931 between Pokagon State Park and US 27. Between late 1967 and early 1968 the road was extended north to SR 120, along the old route of US 27. In late 1968 or early 1969 the road was extended south to US 20 in Angola, along what had been US 27 before it was diverted to Interstate 69. The route from Pokagon State Park to SR 127 became SR 727 that this time.

<text>Vader is a Polish death metal band from Olsztyn. Formed in 1983, the group was founded by then-bassist Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Wiwczarek and guitarist Zbigniew &quot;Vika&quot; Wróblewski. Vader went through several lineup changes over the years, with Wiwczarek as the only constant member. Since 2022, the band has comprised Wiwczarek on lead guitar and vocals, rhythm guitarist Marek &quot;Spider&quot; Pająk, bassist Tomasz &quot;Hal&quot; Halicki, and drummer Michał Andrzejczyk.

Starting as a more traditional heavy metal group, Vader eventually went to thrash, speed, and then in the late 1980s became a death metal band. It would not be until nine years after forming that they managed to release their debut album &quot;The Ultimate Incantation&quot; (1992); Vader has released eleven more studio albums since then. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by Darth Vader from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. Lyrical themes include stories by H. P. Lovecraft, World War II, horror, and science fiction. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, by 2002 Vader sold approximately 500,000 releases around the world.

==History==
Vader was formed in 1983, the same year as the very first death metal pioneers Possessed and Death. However, at this time Vader was a heavy/speed metal band, later evolving into thrash metal and then finally death metal for the band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;Live in Decay&quot;, in 1986. Vader released another demo, &quot;Necrolust&quot;, in 1989, but it was not until the band&#x27;s third demo, &quot;Morbid Reich&quot;, in 1990, that Vader gained international attention. &quot;Morbid Reich&quot; sold nearly 10,000 copies, making it one of the most sold metal demos ever. This success earned the group a contract with Earache Records. The songs from &quot;Morbid Reich&quot; would appear later on Vader&#x27;s full-length debut album in 1992, &quot;The Ultimate Incantation&quot;.

Due to communication breakdowns, the contract with Earache was terminated and the release of &quot;Sothis&quot; and &quot;The Darkest Age: Live &#x27;93&quot;, both in 1994, had to be released on different labels. In the meantime, Vader toured relentlessly, and in 1995, the band signed a contract with Impact Records. Vader then released &quot;De Profundis&quot;, &quot;Future of the Past&quot;, and &quot;Black to the Blind&quot;. Then, Hammerheart Records re-released two early demos, &quot;Necrolust&quot; and &quot;Morbid Reich&quot;, as the compilation &quot;Reborn in Chaos&quot;. In August 1998, Vader released &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. Vader also recorded the &quot;Kingdom&quot; EP and a VHS video entitled &quot;Vision and Voice&quot; around this time; both were released in December. In October 1998, Vader opened for Slayer during a show in Poland. At the end of 1998, Vader signed a contract to Metal Blade Records.

Vader spent most of 1999 touring. In March, Vader embarked on their first headlining US tour, the International Extreme Music Festival 1999, and in May Vader played at Metalmania. In June, the band went on another European tour, and the rest of the summer was filled with numerous appearances at festivals in Central Europe. Vader concluded touring by embarking on a European tour with thrash metal band Testament.

In November and December 1999, Vader recorded the album &quot;Litany&quot;, which was released in March 2000, and recorded a music video for the song &quot;Cold Demons,&quot; which appeared on a special-edition digipack. The release of the album was also supported by live shows, including April&#x27;s No Mercy Festival 2000, and in June, the band embarked on a 30-date European tour with Vital Remains, Fleshcrawl, and Pandemia.

In April 2001, Vader released the EP &quot;Reign Forever World&quot;, featuring re-recorded songs, cover songs, and live tracks. The band promoted the album intensively, touring Poland, Russia and Ukraine, and again in the US. In September 2001, they did another European tour with Cryptopsy, Dying Fetus, Catastrophic, and several other bands. This was followed by ten Polish appearances as part of the Thrash&#x27;em All Festival 2001, along with Krisiun, Behemoth and several Polish death metal and black metal bands.

In 2002, Vader released &quot;Revelations&quot;, and toured England, Scotland, and Ireland during the No Mercy Festival&#x27;s dates. In May, the band released its first DVD, &quot;More Vision and the Voice&quot;. In 2004, the band started recording &quot;The Beast&quot;. Recording sessions for the album were postponed in May due to an accident which injured the drummer, Doc. He was replaced with Daray from the Polish band Vesania. Recording was finished in mid-July, and to support the album, the band toured again, appearing at over 170 concerts. The Europe-wide tour saw Vader&#x27;s first trip to the Balkans. The most important gig of 2004 was at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, where the band opened for Metallica in front of 50,000 people.

In March 2005, long-time drummer, Doc, left the band due to struggling with alcoholism. Five months later, he died unexpectedly from heart failure. He was 34 years old.

In 2008, Novy decided to leave Vader after five years; Marcin Rygiel (ex-Decapitated) replaced him on bass for the U.S. Summer Slaughter Tour 2008. Reyash would join as a permanent bassist later in the year.

In 2009, Vader&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Necropolis&quot;, was released via Nuclear Blast Records. The album was recorded at Hertz studios in Bialystok, Poland with the Wieslawski Bros. In 2011, Vader released another album, entitled &quot;Welcome to the Morbid Reich&quot;.
In December 2013, Vader entered the studio to record their then-upcoming tenth album, titled &quot;Tibi et Igni&quot;, for an early 2014 release. On 7 March 2014, the band finished recording the album, which was released on 30 May by Nuclear Blast. Their next album, &quot;The Empire&quot;, was released on 4 November 2016. The band toured for nearly two years in support of &quot;The Empire&quot;, including headlining a US tour (with support from Internal Bleeding, Sacrificial Slaughter, Voices of Ruin and Micawber) in May and June 2017, and supporting Testament and Annihilator on the European &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; tour in March and April 2018.

The band released an extended play titled &quot;Thy Messenger&quot; on 31 May 2019 through Nuclear Blast. Their newest full-length album, &quot;Solitude in Madness&quot;, was released on 1 May 2020. As of January 2022, according to Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Wiwczarek, Vader has begun recording new music for their next album. In March 2022, it was announced drummer James Stewart had departed the band a month prior and was replaced by Michał Andrzejczyk.

==Musical style, impact and legacy==
Graham Hartmann of Loudwire said, &quot;Until Behemoth’s new millennium rise, Vader served as Poland’s biggest death metal export. They challenged their contemporaries in the speed department alongside mechanized riffing as frontman Piotr “Peter” Wiwczarek spilled the secrets of the ‘Necronimicon’ and other magical mysteries. The sewer monster sounds that emanate from his throat have a whirring quality, but he manages to be intelligible in his delivery, perfectly enunciating each word.&quot;

The name of American rock band Eagles of Death Metal was influenced by Vader. When a friend was trying to introduce Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme to the death metal genre, he played Vader&#x27;s music. Homme called them &quot;The Eagles of death metal.&quot; After coining this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. Afterwards, the phrase became the name of his band.

<text>Crossroads (later known as Crossroads Motel and Crossroads King&#x27;s Oak) is a British television soap opera that ran on ITV over two periods – the original 1964 to 1988 run, followed by a short revival from 2001 to 2003. Set in a fictional motel (hotel in the revival) in the Midlands, &quot;Crossroads&quot; became a byword for low production values, particularly in the 1970s and early 1980s. Despite this, the series regularly attracted huge audiences during this time, with viewership numbers reaching as high as 15 million viewers.

It was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, and produced by ATV (until the end of 1981) and then by ATV&#x27;s successor, Central Independent Television until 1988 when it was axed. The series was revived by Carlton Television in 2001, but due to low ratings it was cancelled again in 2003.

==Storylines==

===1964–1988===
The original premise of &quot;Crossroads&quot; was based on the everyday lives of two feuding sisters, their businesses, staff and customers, specifically in relation to the Crossroads Motel, in the village of Kings Oak near Birmingham. On hearing that Heathbury town council wanted to build a motorway through part of her land, astute businesswoman Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon) had used the compensation money the council offered, and her late husband Charles&#x27;s insurance money, to convert their large Georgian home into a motel – a &quot;motor-hotel&quot; aimed at motorists with parking outside their chalet. Crossroads had 16 chalets, a reception, bar, kitchen, office and private sitting room. According to Meg, the clientele included tourists who were journeying to places like &quot;Stratford On Avon, the Lake District or even those breaking a journey going up to Scotland, as well as commercial travellers, people who have their business going up and down the Midlands, and theatre people.&quot; Charles Richardson and Meg had two children: hotel receptionist Jill (Jane Rossington), born in 1946, and schoolboy Alexander, or &quot;Sandy&quot; (Roger Tonge), who was born in 1950.

Meg went on to become engaged to businessman Hugh Mortimer (John Bentley) but he initially married Jane Templeton (Rosalie Ashley), who was dying of a brain tumour, in order for her to come to England to undergo an operation. She died in hospital, never regaining consciousness following surgery. Meg was then courted by Malcolm Ryder (David Davenport) whom she later married, however, he was a weak, unscrupulous man, and when he found himself in financial difficulties he decided to poison Meg and claim the insurance money. He was discovered, and when confronted with his crime walked out of the motel and out of Meg&#x27;s life. Some time later, news came that he had burnt to death in a car crash in South America, which turned out not to be true; and after the police arrested him for his doppelgänger&#x27;s murder, a divorce was sought. Eight years after their first meeting, Meg and Hugh re-met, fell in love and were married in 1975 at Birmingham Cathedral. Hugh was kidnapped by Australian terrorists, and died of a heart attack in 1978.

In 1970, Jill married John Crayne (Mark Rivers), who, it turned out is already married with a wife and two young daughters living in Switzerland. Jill had therefore married a bigamist, making the marriage null and void; this led Jill to attempt suicide. Following her recovery, Jill turned her attention to down-to-earth electrician Stan Harvey (Edward Clayton), whom she married the following year. In 1975, Jill gave birth to a daughter, Sarah Jane Harvey (Sorrel Dunger). In 1977, Stan spent some time on business in Germany and it was during his absence that Jill had an affair with her step-brother, Anthony Mortimer (Jeremy Sinden) to whom she became pregnant, with their child Matthew, who was subsequently born in 1978. Despite trying to reconcile, Jill and Stan&#x27;s marriage ended in him winning a bitter custody battle, which led to him and Sarah Jane moving to Germany. Anthony thereafter took Matthew to live in New York. Jill had a one-night stand with a television engineer, and again attempted suicide. Jill meets womanising accountant and later Crossroads manager Adam Chance (Tony Adams) on Christmas Day 1978, and in 1983 they are eventually married. This said, by 1988, Jill leaves Adam for a new life with publican John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas).

Meg&#x27;s sister Kitty Jarvis (Beryl Johnstone) ran The Shopday Store, a newsagent&#x27;s and tobacconist&#x27;s shop in the nearby town of Heathbury, where she lived with her pipe-smoking husband Dick Jarvis (Brian Kent), and their son Brian (David Fennell), who was born in 1945. In the programme&#x27;s pre-publicity and first episode it is stated that Dick and Kitty have a daughter, Lesley, who is &quot;out in Australia, doing very well for herself&quot;, unseen, she later marries Maurice Grant, a doctor at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital Adelaide. Dick is initially unemployed, and struggles financially to the point of &quot;borrowing&quot; £2 from Kitty&#x27;s shop till without asking her, with suspicion of the theft falling on their lodger Patrick Wade (Malcolm Young), who unbeknownst to Kitty and Dick is in reality an army deserter by the name of Philip Carroll.  

After going on dates to such places as the Heathbury Bowling Alley and the motel coffee bar, Brian becomes engaged to car hire secretary Janice Gifford (Carolyn Lyster), whom he marries in 1965, the same year Meg&#x27;s and Kitty&#x27;s brother Andy Fraser (Ian Patterson) marries widow woman Ruth Bailey (Pamela Greenhall). The character of Kitty was written out in 1969 after the death of actress Beryl Johnstone. Additional extended family members included Meg&#x27;s black adopted daughter, Melanie Harper (Cleo Sylvestre), Meg&#x27;s adoptive son Bruce Richardson (Michael Walker), Meg&#x27;s niece Penny Richardson (Diana Grayson), and Meg, Kitty and Andy&#x27;s mother &quot;Granny&quot; Fraser (Mollie Maureen). Dick&#x27;s father Enoch Jarvis (Jack Hayes) also makes an appearance.

Among those closest to Meg or her family were former actress Tish Hope (Joy Andrews), Reverend Peter Hope (Neville Hughes), Kitchen worker Vi Blundell (Peggy Aitchison), hotel chef Carlos Raphael (Anthony Morton), his wife Josefina (Gillian Betts), waitress Marilyn Gates (Sue Nicholls), kitchen assistant Amy Turtle (Ann George), postmistress Edith Tatum (Elisabeth Croft), and motel waitress Diane Lawton (Susan Hanson). Others connected to the motel included, suave manager and later motel director David Hunter (Ronald Allen), his first wife Rosemary (Janet Hargreaves), their son Chris (Freddie Foote and later Stephen Hoye), David&#x27;s second wife Barbara (Sue Lloyd), Chefs Gerald Lovejoy (William Avenell), Bernard Booth (David Lawton) and Shughie McFee (Angus Lennie), hairdresser Vera Downend (Zeph Gladstone), the Harvey family, consisting of father Wilf (Morris Parsons) and his grown children Stan (Edward Clayton and later Terry Molloy) and Sheila (Sonia Fox), accountant and later motel manager Adam Chance (Tony Adams), and cleaner Doris Luke (Kathy Staff). Perhaps the most memorable character proved to be the mentally challenged Benny Hawkins (Paul Henry), whose trademark was a woolly hat that was worn all year round. His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War in 1982, who nicknamed the Falkland Islanders &quot;Bennies&quot; after the character. Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with &quot;Stills&quot; for locals – because they were &quot;still Bennies&quot;.

Over the years the series dealt with storylines which were controversial for the times. A single parent working at the motel was hugely controversial in the mid-1960s, as was Sandy Richardson becoming a permanent wheelchair user after a car accident in 1972. The storyline was developed when actor Roger Tonge had himself become a wheelchair user off screen - when he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma - as a way to keep him in the series, thus becoming the first paraplegic regular character portrayed in a British soap opera.

The series also saw black characters appearing regularly – a follow-on from the 1960s BBC soap &quot;Compact&quot;, also created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling. Melanie Harper (Cleo Sylvestre) arrived at the motel in 1970 as Meg&#x27;s foster daughter (itself a taboo issue). Sylvestre was given the role by producer Reg Watson after press coverage of racial tensions in the Birmingham area at that time. In 1978, garage mechanic Joe MacDonald (Carl Andrews) arrived. The year before, an interracial summer romance took place between Cockney garage mechanic Dennis Harper (Guy Ward) and motel receptionist Meena Chaudri (Karan David).

1981 saw a highly controversial storyline about a false accusation of rape; a 1983 storyline saw a test tube baby born to Glenda and Kevin Banks (Lynette McMorrough and David Moran). The subject of Down syndrome was also raised in 1983 with an insight into the life of Nina Weill, a little girl who, as Nina Paget, was befriended by three of the regular &quot;Crossroads&quot; characters.

The character of Meg Richardson was axed in 1981 and was thought to have died in a fire that gutted the motel, but turned up alive aboard the &quot;QE2&quot;, about to sail to a new life overseas. Newspapers reported that three endings were planned for Meg: she would either die in the fire, take sleeping pills or disappear for a while and turn up on the &quot;QE2&quot;. Viewers were surprised to see producers had used all three. Meg returns briefly in 1983 for a reunion with Jill and Adam on their honeymoon in Venice.

In 1985, new producer Phillip Bowman was planning to bring the character of Meg Richardson back into the show as a &quot;permanent occasional&quot;. Plans were well advanced and scripts were written when Noele Gordon died in April of that year, aged 65. Edward Clayton was brought back as Jill&#x27;s ex-husband Stan Harvey to read the lines originally written for Gordon.

In 1986, the new character Ray Grice played by Al Hunter Ashton was introduced as part of an attempt to create wider storylines.

Recording for the show ended at Christmas 1987 with the final episode (a feature length finale) broadcast in April 1988 where Jill drives off into the sunset with her lover to open a &quot;little hotel in the West&quot; that she thought they could call &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

Although Crossroads had always been a family run business, others throughout the years had become shareholders, most notably, Tish Hope, Bernard Booth, Gerald Lovejoy, Louise Borelli, David Hunter, Hugh Mortimer, Adam Chance, Barbara Hunter, J. Henry Pollard and his daughter Miranda. However by the early 1980&#x27;s it became apparent that the family and their shareholders thought differently about the motel&#x27;s future, and in 1985, it was sold off to Major International Hotels, under the management of Nicola Freeman (Gabrielle Drake).

MIH then sold the motel to Tommy Lancaster (Terence Rigby) and his family-run Red Ox business in 1987, transforming it into a luxury hotel that was first named The Crossroads Country Hotel, then, The Kings Oak Country Hotel.

After the death of his wife Mary, Tommy put the hotel back on the market and it was bought by another chain, The Three Crowns Group, with the takeover period overseen by Daniel Freeman (Philip Goodhew) – the stepson of former MIH boss Nicola Freeman.

===2001–2003===
With the revival in 2001, changes were made to characters and stories. Jill Chance had married John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas) and been widowed, but was calling herself Jill Harvey again, the name by which she had been known prior to her marriage to Adam Chance in 1983. In the revival, Jill Harvey owned thirty percent of the hotel, which was never explained as she had divested all her interest in the hotel in 1985 and the original series ended with her opting not to buy the hotel back with her estranged husband Adam Chance. The battle over Jill&#x27;s shares formed the backbone of the storylines for the new series&#x27; early episodes. References were also made to the Russell family taking over a &quot;failing motel&quot;, despite Crossroads having become a hotel in the late 1980s. In the final episode of the original series, the name &#x27;King&#x27;s Oak Country Hotel&#x27; was seen over the entrance doors.

Lack of real links to the past, and the killing of Jill a few months into the new run, turned many fans away. Popular characters in the new &quot;Crossroads&quot; included new owner Kate Russell (Jane Gurnett), supercilious receptionist Virginia Raven (Sherrie Hewson), and womanising deputy manager Jake Booth (Colin Wells). The storyline of the final episode was the revelation that the revived series and glamorous hotel had been a dream of supermarket worker and Crossroads fan Angela, with all the other characters revealed as shoppers. Angela even approaches a female customer in the supermarket and tells her she recognises her as &quot;Tracey Booth from Crossroads&quot;. Tracey&#x27;s mother-in-law, Kate, was also shown as one of Angela&#x27;s colleagues in the supermarket.

In the end, Crossroads aired its last ever episode on 30 May 2003.

==Characters==
==Production history==
===Original start dates===
* 2 November 1964: ATV, Border Television and Ulster Television
* 4 January 1965: Anglia, Associated Rediffusion, TWW, Southern Television, Westward Television and Channel Television.
* 4 January 1965: Grampian Television. However the series was dropped in Autumn 1968 and then picked it back up in April 1969. 
* 11 January 1965: Tyne Tees. The series was dropped and then picked up again several times through this period until January 1972.
* 29 March 1965: Scottish Television.
* 5 November 1968: Yorkshire Television. Also dropped the series for a short period until January 1972.
* 11 September 1972: Granada. The company decided to start with episodes broadcast in January 1972, and it was only screened 3 times a week: Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In March 1975, to match the network over 18 months worth of episodes were skipped.

===ATV era===

&quot;Crossroads&quot; began its run on Monday 2 November 1964 and was first shown five days a week. The episodes were then recorded &quot;as live&quot;, a very common practice at the time, with very limited opportunities for retakes. Within a few months, 10 of the ITV companies had started broadcasting the series, though Granada never screened it during the 1960s. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) decreed in 1967 that &quot;Crossroads&quot; should be reduced in frequency to four episodes per week to improve its quality, by which point the series was no longer networked and each ITV station broadcast the series on different days. The series was widely derided by critics who criticised the wobbly sets and fluffed lines but gained many fans, most famously Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s wife Mary, who complained when the newly formed Thames Television (the franchisee for the London area) decided to stop showing the series in 1968. The decision proved unpopular with viewers and was reversed six months later. It was initially placed in a late afternoon slot. The gap in transmissions meant viewers in the Thames region were about six months behind the rest of the country for several years until just before Megs wedding in March 1975. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was not fully broadcast to all ITV companies until 1972, when Granada took it up. Though second to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in the ratings at the beginning of the decade, &quot;Crossroads&quot; did occasionally beat it, gaining audiences of up to 15 million viewers.

In 1979, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) – then commercial television&#x27;s regulator – decided production should be reduced further to three episodes a week from April 1980; the IBA chairman, Lady Plowden, reportedly describing the soap opera as &quot;distressingly popular&quot;. ATV planned to replace the fourth episode with a spin-off series called &quot;A Family Affair&quot;, but this idea was dropped.

Series star Noele Gordon, who played matriarch Meg Richardson, won the &quot;TV Times&quot; &#x27;Most Compulsive Female Character&#x27; viewers award eight consecutive years during the 1970s. After winning for the eighth time, Gordon was placed in the TVTimes &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; and thenceforth ineligible for the award in the future. Viewers reacted negatively to the dismissal of Gordon in 1981, an action taken by head of programming Charles Denton who became a &quot;national hate figure&quot;. The series producer Jack Barton agreed with Denton, thinking that Gordon&#x27;s character had become too dominant, but Gordon&#x27;s final episode gained heavy coverage in the press for some time.

In January 2023, ITVX screened a new drama featuring Helena Bonham Carter as Noele Gordon. Written by Russell T Davies, titled &quot;Nolly,&quot; it followed her period in and after &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

===Central era===
Despite having maintained its ITV franchise at the end of 1981, ATV was ordered by the IBA to reform into Central Independent Television, which took over the franchise on 1 January 1982 and was thought to show limited enthusiasm for the programmes it inherited. Further changes were introduced in March 1985, when new filming locations, sets and characters were introduced. Storylines began to revolve around new motel owner Nicola Freeman (Gabrielle Drake), and long-term characters like David and Barbara Hunter (Ronald Allen and Sue Lloyd) were axed. The theme tune was also updated, and the opening titles replaced with a longer version. Finally, the show was renamed &quot;Crossroads Motel&quot; – although this fact was never formally announced by the show&#x27;s production team, and the word &quot;Motel&quot; was simply incorporated into the opening titles. The closing titles, which had scrolled in horizontal and vertical &#x27;crossroad&#x27; directions since the first ever episodes, were replaced with conventional scrolling credits.

In 1986, William Smethurst took over as producer following the dismissal of his predecessor, Philip Bowman. Smethurst had been brought in by Central Television&#x27;s new head of drama, Ted Childs, and ordered changes aimed at improving production values and creating a wittier, more upmarket serial. Smethurst shifted the narrative centre to the nearby village of King&#x27;s Oak, and yet more long-running characters, including fan favourites Diane Hunter (Susan Hanson) and Benny Hawkins (Paul Henry), were dropped; as with earlier changes, this was unpopular with viewers, who telephoned Central in protest. Smethurst gained the nickname &quot;Butcher Bill&quot; but was unfazed, having successfully reversed the declining fortunes of BBC radio soap &quot;The Archers&quot;. Smethurst insisted he only got backlash because his was the name the public knew.

Further changes included the series being renamed &quot;Crossroads Kings Oak&quot; for a time, with the intention in the future of shortening this to merely &quot;King&#x27;s Oak&quot;. However, this final change was overtaken in June 1987 by Andy Allen, Central&#x27;s director of programmes, who chose to axe the series. The familiar theme tune was replaced in September 1987 by a new theme composed by Max Early and Raf Ravenscroft . New titles were introduced to accompany the new theme, which featured stills of King&#x27;s Oak and the new King&#x27;s Oak Country Hotel. Michele Buck guided the show through its final few months on air as series producer, with William Smethurst still on hand as executive producer.

In January 1988, the series was reduced to only two episodes a week, with &quot;Crossroads King&#x27;s Oak&quot; finally coming to an end on 4 April 1988 (the Easter bank holiday). The last, extended episode saw the only remaining original character, Jill Chance (Jane Rossington), riding off with her new lover John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas). Asked what name she would give the hotel she would be running in her new life, the character remarked, a little sadly, &quot;I always thought Crossroads was an awfully good name&quot;.

===Carlton era===

In April 2000, Carlton Television (who had bought Central in 1994) announced that they would be reviving &quot;Crossroads&quot; for the daytime slot on ITV. The first revived episode was broadcast on 5 March 2001 with a glossy format, to the surprise of the wider media. The revived series was sponsored by washing detergent Surf and was broadcast each weekday at 1.30pm and 5.05pm on ITV, with a Sunday omnibus on ITV2. The revived series was also broadcast in Ireland on RTÉ One and in New Zealand on TV One.

Four characters from the original series returned: Jill Harvey, her daughter Sarah-Jane (Joanne Farrell/Holly Newman), her ex-husband Adam Chance (Tony Adams) and motel cleaner Doris Luke (Kathy Staff). Initial reactions were favourable; however, changes in story from the original were puzzling for fans and did not help ratings. Kathy Staff left in dismay at the show&#x27;s emphasis on sex, telling ITV Teletext that she felt it was no longer the family-friendly show she had originally been involved with.

The decision to kill off original character Jill Harvey, who was murdered by Adam Chance three months into the series&#x27; revival, proved unpopular with fans of the original show. Jane Rossington has said that she did not want to commit herself to another long run in the show, but warned Carlton it would be suicidal to kill Jill.

Episode 137 of the second revived series remains the only episode never to be shown in full on ITV. The lunchtime screening on Tuesday 11 September 2001 began at 14:10, but during the advertisement break, the programme was interrupted by &quot;ITV News&quot; with coverage of the 9/11 attacks in New York City. A short recap of events in Episode 137 was screened before both the 14:10 and 17:05 showings of Episode 138 on 12 September 2001, and the episode was included in the Omnibus edition that Sunday.

The series was reduced to four episodes a week from 10 September 2001 until July/August 2002 before increasing 5 episodes per week until 30 August 2002. From there, the series went into a hiatus from until January 2003, during which time further changes were made.

The remodelled series, under producer Yvon Grace, appeared to be a self-consciously camp parody with Jane Asher playing a new central character, Angel Samson. The series also featured appearances from Kate O&#x27;Mara and Anne Charleston, as well as light entertainment names including Lionel Blair, Les Dennis and Tim Brooke-Taylor. This remodelled revival also launched the careers of Freema Agyeman (&quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot;), Luke Roberts (&quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;Mile High&quot;), Lucy Pargeter, Shauna Shim and Jessica Fox.

Yvon Grace admitted she was aiming the new &quot;Crossroads&quot; towards an LGBT audience, but fans were displeased by her ambivalence towards unresolved storylines from the 2001–2002 run. Plans were in place to bring Adam Chance back on a three-month contract in a last attempt to bring in more viewers; actor Tony Adams said that a down-on-his luck Adam would have been taken under Angel&#x27;s wing as her personal assistant. But as rating continued declining, the revived series was also axed in March 2003, with the final episode being broadcast on Friday 30 May.

The 2003 series was roundly criticised for moving too far away from the premise of the original 1964–88 series and the initial 2001–02 series, as well as for becoming &quot;too camp&quot;. Jane Asher later apologised to fans for the way the 2003 series went. The ending scene of the final episode of the (second) revival was considered by many long-term fans to be quite weird and a bizarre surprise, where the entire revived run was revealed to have been entirely the daydream of a supermarket worker, as the Irish Mirror reports here.

==Theme music==
The &quot;Crossroads&quot; theme tune was composed by Tony Hatch. In 2004 Hatch said:

A selection of cues was recorded, including &quot;Meg&#x27;s Theme&quot; which eventually became the standard opening theme, &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Theme&quot; which was phased out as action focused on the motel, the closing theme which combined both &quot;Meg&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Kitty&#x27;s&quot; themes, and a variety of background pieces.

A rerecording by The Tony Hatch Sound was issued as a single by Pye Records in 1965. A special arrangement of the theme by Wings was occasionally used from the late 1970s, usually when an episode ended with a dramatic event; that version appears on the band&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Venus and Mars&quot;.

Central Independent Television&#x27;s head of music Johnny Patrick rearranged the tune in 1985 for piano and synthesiser, upon the show&#x27;s relaunch as &quot;Crossroads Motel&quot; by producer Philip Bowman. Following William Smethurst&#x27;s arrival as producer in 1987, this recording was overdubbed with added synthesisers.

An entirely new theme aired in late 1987 when the series was relaunched as &quot;Crossroads, Kings Oak&quot;, composed by Johnny Patrick with Raf Ravenscroft, Max Early and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. This later formed the basis of the single released by actress Shona Linsdey, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, to commemorate the end of the show in 1988. The B-side of Linsdey&#x27;s single featured the original version of the 1964 Tony Hatch arrangement.

The 2001 revival brought back the original Tony Hatch theme, this time arranged and performed by Tony Flynn. Another version, in 2003, was arranged by Patrick Dineen and performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic.

==Locations==
The fictional Crossroads Motel was in an equally fictional village near Birmingham, Kings Oak (there are real suburbs in south-west Birmingham called Kings Heath, Kings Norton and Selly Oak). A number of real-life hotels doubled for location filming; it is stated in the 1982 &quot;Crossroads Special&quot; that the Longshoot Motel (Nuneaton) was used as a &#x27;blueprint&#x27; in designing the motel and it is likely that some scenes were filmed there during the run of the series.

In 1970, the series gained an O.B unit, giving it the freedom to do location shooting. Originally, Tanworth-in-Arden, south of Solihull, was used for King&#x27;s Oak, although outside scenes were only occasionally used. Under Central, more location shooting began to be featured. Some early King&#x27;s Oak location material was also filmed in Wolverhampton. The most famous location – as seen in the programme during the 1960s and 1970s was not a motel at all, but The Shropshire Agricultural Institution (now called North Shropshire College). In October 2019 two of the buildings used during filming, teaching block and Bridden accommodation block were removed from the site.

It has also been suggested that &quot;Crossroads&quot; was filmed at a 1960s motel on Stratford Road in Alcester Warwickshire called CherryTrees (the buildings were demolished in 2001 and a care home was built), however it was a nearby petrol station (now closed) that was used in the early 1980s for filming a couple of outdoor scenes of the Crossroads garage. After the in-story destruction of the motel by fire, the revamped motel was filmed from 1982 at the Golden Valley Hotel (now Jurys Inn) in Cheltenham; from 1985 filming moved to the Penns Hall Hotel (now Ramada Jarvis Birmingham) in Sutton Coldfield, the changed appearance explained as being due to rebuilding. At the time of the move to Sutton Coldfield, new studio sets were also introduced.

Other locations included the canal (including Gas Street Basin) behind the studios in Birmingham; in-story this was the King&#x27;s Oak Canal, on which hairdresser Vera Downend had a boat. The Chateau Impney Hotel also featured numerous times, most famously when Hugh proposed to Meg in 1973, and it was used to hold their wedding party two years later. The Chateau Impney was renamed the Droitwich Hotel on-screen. St Laurence&#x27;s Church in Alvechurch was the setting for Jill and Adam Chance&#x27;s wedding in 1983. Hagley Hall was used for the wedding reception. Helios Health Club based in Brierley Hill was used as the location for the Motel Health Club, filmed on Mondays when the health club was closed.

In 1985, &quot;Crossroads&quot; gained its first set of full length opening titles, filmed around Sutton Coldfield, Tanworth-in-Arden and in Birmingham city centre.

The revived &quot;Crossroads&quot; from 2001 was still set in the West Midlands; however, exterior shots were filmed at locations in and around Nottingham, such as Bingham and Redmile.

The original series was recorded at ATV&#x27;s/Central&#x27;s Broad Street studios in Birmingham, while the revived series was filmed at Carlton Studios in Nottingham.

==Critical reception==
Critics disliked the show from the start, but it struck a chord with the viewing public, and trounced rival daytime soaps like &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Because it was made on a shoestring budget, and because of the number of episodes produced per week, its flaws and inconsistencies became noticeable. The sets wobbled, actors fluffed their lines and some popular characters simply disappeared; for example, Benny Hawkins (Paul Henry) was last seen on-screen ascending a ladder to put a fairy at the top of a Christmas tree, and never appeared again.

Despite the popularity of &quot;Crossroads&quot; with the viewing public, the show was often criticised by TV reviewers and ridiculed by British comedians. Television historian Hilary Kingsley stated that &quot;Crossroads&quot; never failed &quot;to provide its critics with ammunition. Some of the acting would have disgraced the humblest of village halls; many of the plots were so farcical they could have been written in a bad dream, and much of the dialogue was pathetic.&quot; &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic British TV&quot; noted that &quot;&quot;Crossroads&quot; was the series that no-one seemed to love. Yet at its peak, it was watched by more viewers than any other soap except &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.&quot;

The revived series also received mixed reviews from critics.

== &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; ==
Spoof soap opera &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot;, created by comedian Victoria Wood as part of &quot;Victoria Wood As Seen on TV&quot;, is a deliberate parody of &quot;Crossroads&quot;. The final episode of &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; features a faux documentary, &#x27;The Making of Acorn Antiques&#x27;, in which the actress playing Mrs Overall (Julie Walters) – a character based on &quot;Crossroads&quot; characters Amy Turtle (Ann George) and Mavis Hooper (Charmain Eyre) – is revealed as a rather grand character who considers herself a huge star. This portrayal, plus a later pretend news item, in which it is revealed she has been sacked from the show, suggest the actress character (later given the name Bo Beaumont in the musical based on the sketches) is based on Noele Gordon, with Bo making her &#x27;goodbye&#x27; appearance to the press in headscarf and large sunglasses, similar to Gordon.

== Legacy ==
In 1974 Crossroads did something unprecedented. It spun a plot that led to the creation of a charity - Crossroads Care. Meg Richardson (Noele Brown) had a son, Sandy (Roger Tonge), who in a storyline became wheelchair-bound after a car accident. Meg became his primary carer but was due to take a month&#x27;s holiday and faced the dilemma of who would care for Sandy while she was away. She created the fictional support group Caring for Carers and the storyline struck a chord with the viewing public.

It wasn&#x27;t long before handicapped viewers or their families started calling in asking for information about the support group launched by Meg in the show. The only problem was that the support group was fictional and didn&#x27;t exist. Recognizing an urgent need, Crossroads set up a charitable organization to fill the gap in care provision highlighted by its own storyline. ATV invested £10,000 (£130,000 in 2024) for a pilot scheme for 28 families and Crossroads, Caring for Carers was born. A successful charity emerged from the show with the purpose of delivering respite care services and support for unpaid carers across the United Kingdom.

What started as a television-inspired initiative grew into one of the UK&#x27;s leading providers of support for carers and the people they care for. Spanning decades of work, Crossroads Care evolved but at its core, it remains devoted to alleviating the pressures faced by unpaid family carers.

=== Long Lasting Legacy ===
The organization&#x27;s vital importance was highlighted even more during the Covid-19 pandemic where the need for carer support was brought sharply into focus. Crossroads Care&#x27;s services became a beacon of hope and relief to many who were isolated or struggling to balance the weight of their caring responsibilities.

The charity is now a network of more than 120 local, independent charities with many still carrying the Crossroads name. It remains focused on supporting the contribution that unpaid carers make. For a television show to create such an impactful legacy is rare.

==DVD release==

Network issued four volumes of the series on DVD (UK Region 2) in 2005, with 12 of the original ATV episodes in each volume (the first release including Meg&#x27;s 1975 wedding,the highest rated episode), shortly followed &quot;Crossroads volume 2&quot; was released (this second release included the 1981&quot;Crossroads&quot; fire, the third release was delayed due to the loss of ATV documents listing which episodes still exist, and ITV staff having to use other resources to locate episodes.

&quot;Crossroads Volume 3&quot; was released on 26 February 2007. There are two versions of the DVD, one being a special limited edition, which contains an extra third disc – featuring recently found episodes from 1976. &quot;Crossroads Volume 4&quot; was released on 17 September 2007.

Network was in the process of releasing all known surviving episodes (at the time) in transmission order exclusively through its website. The first set of 16 episodes was released in January 2008 and contained some episodes not previously available on earlier DVD releases. There are apparently 1,700 episodes of &quot;Crossroads&quot; in existence; most of these are from Central Television&#x27;s run of the show from 1982 to 1988. Over 20 archive volumes of &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;with each and every surviving episode in transmission order&quot;, have been released so far, with &quot;Crossroads Archive Volume 20&quot; the most recently released, in April 2009.

On 2 November 2009, to coincide with the show&#x27;s 45th anniversary, Network re-released the 21 volumes – including Volume 1.1, see below – in a 41-disc box-set. Susan Hanson, who played Diane Hunter, appeared on &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; and &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 6 and 13 November 2009 respectively, to promote the box-set.

A black and white &quot;Crossroads Archive Volume 1.1&quot; has also been released, containing the episode from April 1965, along with 2 further episodes (nos. 1884 and 1886 from March 1973, which were both originally made in colour but now survive only as black and white telerecordings).

On 1 December 2022, Network distribution under licence by ITV Studios announced a new DVD boxset titled &quot;Crossroads: The Noele Gordon Collection&quot;, a 94-disc DVD boxset. Containing over 700 episodes, of every episode known to exist from 1964, until the episode that originally aired on, 31 December 1981 including Gordon&#x27;s last appearance in November 1981. Alongside special features, including. Noele&#x27;s return - the episodes filmed in Venice in 1983, Original trailers and promos. Archive interviews with Noele Gordon, Crossroads: Thirty Years On, and Crossroads Revisited documentaries. An Exclusive photo souvenir magazine and much more! was released on 30 January 2023. In February 2023 Network re-released &quot;Crossroads volume 1&quot; and &quot;Crossroads volume 2&quot; together as a four DVD set, with new sleeve and disc artwork and titled &quot;Crossroads Classics&quot;.

<text>Diggers Rest railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sunbury line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the north-western suburb of Diggers Rest, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Diggers Rest station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 2 October 1859, with the current station provided in 2012.

==History==

Diggers Rest opened on 2 October 1859, eight months after the railway line from Sunshine was extended to Sunbury. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the fact that the area was used as a resting place for prospectors travelling to Bendigo during the Victorian gold rush.

At the time of opening, a small goods shed and siding were provided. In 1928, interlocked gates were provided at the Calder Highway level crossing, located at the down end of the station, and were replaced with boom barriers in 1982. In 1989, the goods siding was abolished and, in 1992, the remaining crossover was removed. The waiting room and booking lobby inside the building on Platform 1 were also provided in that year and, along with the signal box, was restored in 2002, after being damaged by fire during the previous year. On 16 April 2005, the signal box was abolished, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

On 18 November 2012, the station was added to the metropolitan network, when the line between Watergardens and Sunbury was electrified. As part of those works, the station was refurbished, with both platforms extended at the up (Flinders Street) end. The car park was also enlarged.

On 21 October 2022, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Old Calder Highway level crossing was to be grade separated with a road over rail design. Also in that year, both platforms were extended in length, from 159m to 163m.

==Platforms and services==

Diggers Rest has two side platforms. It is served by Sunbury line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Sunbury

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

==Transport links==
Sunbury Bus Service operates two routes via Diggers Rest station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

* : to Sunbury station

* : Sunbury station – Moonee Ponds Junction

<text>Yechiel Michel ha-Levi Epstein ()
(24 January 1829 – 25 March 1908), often called &quot;the &quot;Aruch haShulchan&quot;&quot; after his magnum opus, &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;, was a Rabbi and &quot;posek&quot; (authority in Jewish law) in Lithuania.

==Biography==
Yechiel Michel Epstein was born on 24 January 1829 in Babruysk, Russian Empire (presently in Belarus) to Aharon Yitzchak and Rashka Epstein.
His father Aharon Yitzchak Epstein was a builder and contractor who spend much of his time traveling for his work, which were often projects of the Czarist government.
He had one brother, Benjamin Beinush Epstein, who lived in Saint Petersburg. The two brothers stayed in touch over the years, and when Epstein needed to travel to Saint Petersburg—usually to submit his writings to the Russian censor before publishing—he would stay at his brother&#x27;s house.
As a child, Epstein studied in a traditional Cheder. His original intent was to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps: to work as a merchant, while dedicating time to daily Torah study. In his youth, he engaged in trade and was fluent in Russian, a skill not commonly found in rabbis at that time. However, Rabbi Eliyahu Goldberg, rabbi of the nearby town of Parichi (and a student of Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin), took an interest in the youth; the rabbi convinced Epstein to leave commerce and dedicate himself to Torah study. Soon after, Epstein left for the famed Volozhin yeshiva, where he studied for two years.
In Volozhin, he met and started a lifelong friendship with Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (the &quot;Netziv&quot;), who later became the &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; (head) of the Volozhin Yeshiva. After finishing his studies there, Epstein married Berlin&#x27;s sister Michlah. (Epstein later became Berlin&#x27;s father-in-law, when Berlin remarried to Epstein&#x27;s daughter Batya Miriam after the death of his first wife.)

After his marriage, Epstein returned to Babruysk, and he taught in the Altshul yeshiva there.
He received &quot;semicha&quot; (rabbinic ordination) from Rabbi Eliyahu Goldberg, who had been appointed rabbi and Av Beit Din of the Mitnagged community of Babruysk in 1852.

By 1862, Epstein was serving as a dayan (religious judge) on Goldberg&#x27;s beit din. Most of the family&#x27;s income, however, came from his wife&#x27;s fabric store. When eulogizing his wife, Epstein remarked—perhaps in exaggeration—that for 30 years Michlah ran the family store, and he did not even know where the store was located.
In 1864, at the age of 35, Epstein was appointed rabbi of Novozybkov (east of Gomel, now Bryansk region), a town with a large number of Hasidic Jews, mainly adherents of Chabad Lubavitch and Chernobyl. Several months after arriving in Novozybkov, Epstein traveled to Lubavitch where he visited Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, also known as the Tzemach Tzedek, the third rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic Jews. His major endeavor during this period was writing his first work, &quot;Ohr LaYesharim&quot;, a commentary to &quot;Sefer HaYashar&quot; of Rabbeinu Tam. He printed the first volume of this work in 1869, but lacked the funds to publish more.

In 1874, after ten years as rabbi in Novozybkov, Epstein was appointed as the rabbi of Navahrudak, where he would serve for 34 years, until his death. Here, he was recognized as a &quot;posek&quot; (decisor of Jewish law), and he was to compose most of his writings in Navahrudak.

Epstein was involved in many charitable endeavors. He was particularly close to Rabbi Shmuel Salant, the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, and wrote extensively on the obligation of all Jews to support the Rabbi Meir Baal Haneis charity that Rabbi Salant founded in Israel in 1860.

Epstein died on 22 Adar II 5668 (25 March 1908) and is buried in Navahrudak.

==Children==
The Epsteins had 5 children:
* Eidel Kahanov, his first born, married a wealth merchant from Odessa.
* Rabbi , the eldest son, moved to Jerusalem in 1902, where he served in a number of public positions.
* Brina Walbrinska took over publishing her father&#x27;s works after his death. She was also on the executive board of the Navahrudak orphanage.
* Batya Miriam Berlin divorced her first husband, a young man from a wealthy family, several months after the wedding, as he was unwilling to fulfill his promise to dedicate himself to Torah study. When Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin&#x27;s first wife died several years later, she happily agreed to marry him, even though the rosh yeshiva was 30 years her senior. Among their children was Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan.
* Rabbi Baruch Epstein was a bookkeeper by profession but produced a number of scholarly and popular works, most notably the &quot;Torah Temimah&quot;.

==Works==
* &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot; - his magnum opus, a code of Halakha tracing the origins of each law and custom, clarifying the opinions of the Rishonim and arriving at a &quot;psak&quot; (decision) - often supported by (and sometimes in disagreement with) the Acharonim. Regarded by some as the most comprehensive, seminal, and original modern restatement of Jewish law since Rambam. 
* &quot;Aruch HaShulchan he&#x27;Atid&quot; (&quot;Laying the Table of the Future&quot;) - a parallel work to Arukh HaShulkhan, summarising and analysing the laws that will apply in Messianic times. This work became more relevant when Jewish farming communities were re-established in Israel, since many agricultural laws which apply only in Israel are covered in this work.
* &quot;Ohr la-Yesharim&quot; - his first work, a commentary on the classic work &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot; by the Tosafist Rabbeinu Tam.
* &quot;Meichal ha-Mayim&quot; - a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud.
* &quot;Leil Shimurim&quot; - a commentary on the Haggadah for Passover.
* &quot;Derashot Kol Ben Levi&quot; - a collection of sermons he delivered in the main synagogue of Navahrudak, often including long Halakhic sections.

==Prominent rabbis he ordained==
As a well-known authority of Halakha, many young scholars asked to receive his &quot;semicha&quot; (rabbinic ordination).
Below is a partial list of prominent rabbis whom Epstein ordained:

<doc id="709044" wikidata="Q7639009" url="?curid=709044" title="Sunbury railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Sunbury railway station is a commuter, regional railway station and the terminus of the suburban Sunbury line and the regional Deniliquin line. It opened on 10 February 1859, with the current station being provided in 2012.

The station is also served by V/Line services to Bendigo and Echuca. The disused Rupertswood station is located between Sunbury and Clarkefield.

==History==
Sunbury station opened as a terminus, with the railway line not extended further for two years. The three-track yard dates from that time, and was unique in Victoria. There was a large goods shed on the southern side, a large silo on the northern side, as well as sheep and cattle ramps and yards. There was also housing for railway staff, including two houses in Horne Street, and the stationmaster&#x27;s house in Brook Street, which were all demolished in the 1980s.

Until 1981, proper interlocking of the signals and point work did not exist, and the station was not fully interlocked until 1998, when Solid State Interlocking was provided. On 16 April 2005, that interlocking was abolished, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

In late 1993, the station was refurbished, with upgrades included an enclosed booking lobby, an air-conditioned waiting room, repainting of the station buildings, and landscaping of the garden area around the station. In 2005, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, the layout of the station was again altered.

On 18 November 2012, Sunbury station was added to the metropolitan network, when the line from Watergardens was electrified. The station was also upgraded as part of those works. Electrification of the line to Sunbury had first been proposed in the 1970s, along with a new station along the Sunbury bank north of the Jackson Creek bridge, to serve the Goonawarra housing estate. However, after a drop in population estimates, that idea was abandoned.

In 1940, flashing-light warning signals were provided at the former Gap Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station, with boom barriers provided in 1983. In 2005, the level crossing was modified as part of the Regional Fast Rail project and, in 2012, was modified again, as part of the electrification of the line to Sunbury. On 30 November 2018, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the level crossing would be grade separated, with the road passing underneath the railway line. The project was brought forward from 2025, and was completed in September 2022.

==Platforms and services==

Sunbury has two side platforms and is served by Sunbury line trains, as well as V/Line Bendigo and Echuca line trains.

Platform 1:
* terminating services; all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* V/Line services to Southern Cross, Bendigo, Eaglehawk and Epsom
* V/Line services to Southern Cross and Echuca

Platform 2:
* terminating services; all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* V/Line services to Bendigo, Eaglehawk, Epsom and Southern Cross
* V/Line services to Echuca and Southern Cross


In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Sunbury line will be through-routed with those on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Craigieburn railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the suburban Craigieburn line and regional Seymour line, part of the Melbourne and Victorian rail networks. It serves the northern suburb of Craigieburn in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Craigieburn station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 22 July 1872, with the current station provided in 2010.

==History==
The railway through Craigieburn originally opened in 1872, as part of the North East line to School House Lane. When the station opened, there was a small timber station building, which was replaced by a larger building in 1878, having the same design as other small stations on the line. In 1874, the station opened to goods traffic. In 1920, a larger timber station building was constructed on Platform 1.

The station originally had a passing loop, which was used regularly to cross trains until the line was duplicated in 1886. In 1899, a lever frame was provided on the down platform, which was moved to the new station building in 1922. A number of goods sidings were provided at the station, with the last siding removed in 1982. In 1961, the old Hume Highway road overpass opened, replacing a level crossing, as part of the construction of the North East standard gauge project. In 1975, the former sheep and cattle races at the station were abolished. In 1988, the signal box was closed, all signals were removed, and the station was abolished as a block post. In 1996, a small building was constructed on Platform 1, housing a kiosk and ticket facilities.

In 2007, the station was rebuilt as a premium station, as part of the extension of electrified services from Broadmeadows, with a signal box, stabling sidings and a crossover between lines also provided. On 30 September of that year, suburban train operator Connex began services to and from the station.

In March 2009, Platform 1 was demolished and rebuilt to a similar design to Platform 2. The track on Platform 1 was also electrified, and additional crossovers were provided at the up and down ends of the station, to allow down trains to diverge to the up line.

On 4 May 2010, a collision between a Comeng train set and a Kilmore East-bound quarry train, hauled by Pacific National locomotive G524, occurred between Roxburgh Park and Craigieburn.

<text>Belgrave (Puffing Billy) railway station is situated in Belgrave, a suburb of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria. It is the inner terminal of the famous Puffing Billy heritage steam railway.

Belgrave (Puffing Billy) is adjacent to, and forms an interchange with, Belgrave suburban railway station, which is the outer terminal of the Belgrave line of Melbourne&#x27;s broad gauge (5 ft 3in) electric suburban network. The suburban station is accessible via a short footpath. Before this station was built, the original narrow gauge line ran from the original site of the narrow-gauge station (approximately where the existing Metro station car park is) to Selby station.

<text>Menzies Creek railway station, formerly known as Aura railway station, is located on the Puffing Billy Railway in the town of the same name.

==History==
It was opened with the line on 18 December 1900. It was named after an early settler John Menzies. On 5 December 1904 it was renamed Aura, after the estate of the Shire President. The station reverted to its previous name on 4 July 1947. Throughout this period, the Post Office kept the name of the town as Menzies Creek which it remains to this day.

When the station was operating under the Victorian Railways it had a loop siding, a standard portable station building, and a goods shed. As the original station building had long been demolished, a replacement building of reclaimed Victorian Railways&#x27; &quot;portables&quot; was built in the 1980s. In 1990 the station buildings was moved to its current position as an island platform during a construction exercise undertaken by combat engineers of the 7th Field Engineer Regiment (Australian Army Reserve).

==Platforms and layout==
Menzies Creek has an island crossing platform with a track on each side, a loop siding and a siding into the Puffing Billy Narrow Gauge Museum.

==Facilities==
The station now is home to the Aura Tearooms, the Puffing Billy Narrow Gauge Museum, and a Signal bay containing a 14-lever interlocking frame.

<doc id="709062" wikidata="Q460841" url="?curid=709062" title="Berlin School of experimental psychology">
<text>The Berlin School of Experimental Psychology was founded by Carl Stumpf, a pupil of Franz Brentano and Hermann Lotze and a professor at the University of Berlin, in 1893. It adhered to the method of experimental phenomenology, which understood it as the science of phenomena. It is also noted as the originator of Gestalt psychology. Noted members include Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler.

== History ==
Stumpf founded the Berlin Laboratory of Experimental Psychology in 1893. The institute, which is also known as the school of Gestalt psychology, was part of the University of Berlin. It was a refinement of Brentano&#x27;s neo-Aristotelian theory or the study of phenomena&#x27;s qualitative properties. After the German revolution, the Berlin laboratory relocated to a wing of the former Imperial Palace. This marked the expansion of the Berlin school after it was forced to reduce its operations during the war. The new facility, which was also supported by the Society for Experimental Psychology, focused on applied work and incorporated its own laboratory so that it became an expanded university institute. Stumpf was the chair of the institute for 26 years. He was succeeded by Wolfgang Köhler.

Stumpf influenced his pupils such as Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Kurt Lewin, and these contributed to the school&#x27;s development. Lewin, for instance, developed a set of models and ideas linked to change management theory and practice. These psychologists further refined Stumpf&#x27;s work, which facilitated experimental investigation that culminated in the development of Gestalt psychology. These psychologists stressed the primacy of objects as units of experience, instead of sensations.

Only after Köhler took over the direction of the psychology institute in 1922 did the Berlin School effectively become a school for Gestalt psychology.

<doc id="709064" wikidata="Q17122098" url="?curid=709064" title="Offset (botany)">
<text>In botany and horticulture, an offset (also called a pup, mainly in the US,) is a small, virtually complete daughter plant that has been naturally and asexually produced on the mother plant. They are clones, meaning that they are genetically identical to the mother plant. They can divide mitotically. In the plant nursery business and gardens, they are detached and grown in order to produce new plants. This is a cheap and simple process for those plants that readily produce offsets as it does not usually require specialist materials and equipment.

An offset or &#x27;pup&#x27; may also be used as a broad term to refer to any short shoot originating from the ground at the base of another shoot. The term &#x27;sucker&#x27; has also been used as well, especially for bromeliads, which can be short lived plants and when the parent plant has flowered, they signal the root nodes to form new plants.

Offsets form when meristem regions of plants, such as axillary buds or homologous structures, differentiate into a new plant with the ability to become self-sustaining. This is particularly common in species that develop underground storage organs, such as bulbs, corms and tubers. Tulips and lilies are examples of plants that display offset characteristics by forming cormlets around the original mother corm. In the UK, the term &#x27;bulbils&#x27; is used for lilies. It can take up to 3 years for the bulbil to store enough energy to produce a flower stem. although larger bulbs (such as &quot;Cardiocrinum giganteum&quot;) may take 5 to 7 years before flowering.

It is a means of plant propagation. When propagating plants to increase a stock of a cultivar, thus seeking identical copies of parent plant, various cloning techniques (asexual reproduction) are used. Offsets are a natural means by which plants may be cloned.

In contrast, when propagating plants to create new cultivars, sexual reproduction through pollination is used to create seeds. The recombination of genes gives rise to offspring plant with similar but distinct offspring genome.

<text>Lakeside railway station is situated on the Puffing Billy Railway in Melbourne, Australia. It was opened in 1944 to serve Emerald Lake Park, a popular picnic and recreation reserve created during World War II. The station originally consisted of a short single-face platform on the up side of the line, approximately on the site of the current locomotive water tanks. It had a name board and a red flag for intending passengers to signal to the train crew, but no shelter.

Lakeside today is a staff station, with a passing loop, island platform and waiting shelters. A booking office and refreshment room is across the track on what was the post-reopening single-face platform. There is also a second loop siding beyond the former park access road for the single-face third platform which services the Visitor Centre. A short, dead-end spur extends past the down end of this loop siding.

Of interest is a working wig-wag level crossing warning signal, which operates at the former park access road between the platform and storage siding. It is believed to be the only regularly operating wig-wag signal in Victoria.

Australia&#x27;s biggest model railway, the Emerald Lake Model Railway, is located near the station.

<text>Metroads were the primary road routes serving the Sydney and Brisbane metropolitan areas from the 1990s to the early 2010s. The Metroads formed a network of radial and circumferential routes throughout the cities, simplifying navigation. Metroads have been progressively phased out in both Sydney and Brisbane, replaced by alphanumeric route numbers. Brisbane is the only city currently retaining the Metroad system.

==History==

Historically, National Routes passed through city centres and formed some of the main thoroughfares within Australia&#x27;s largest cities. However urban growth led to massive congestion in the inner city areas. To bypass these centres, new roads were either constructed or main suburban roads were linked together to form ring roads linking one National Route to the other. The earliest scheme was adopted in Sydney in 1964, the Ring Road scheme. They had special markers for identification.

Intra-urban navigation was made increasingly difficult by urban sprawl. Many States introduced State Route systems in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and many roads within metropolitan areas were included. This scheme was adopted by most major cities. In Sydney the State Routes superseded the Ring Road scheme. Urban freeways in Sydney and Brisbane had their own route marking scheme.

However, it was later realised that the multiplicity of urban route marking schemes led to confusion. In the 1990s, these were streamlined in the new Metroad scheme. This scheme ensures that main priority routes are clearly identified and marked. As far as possible, urban freeways are absorbed into the system. It was adopted in Sydney in 1993 and Brisbane in 1996. Metroads usually completely replaced the State Routes and National Routes along their routes; however, State Routes not on designated Metroads were usually left untampered.

Metroad routes in both Sydney and Brisbane are being replaced by alphanumeric routes. Brisbane Metroads began to be phased out around 2010, with Sydney Metroads completely phased out at the end of 2013.

As of 2015, the Department of Main Roads in Queensland have no plans to convert/decommission the remaining Metroad sections within Brisbane.

==List of Metroads==

===Sydney Metroads===
The Metroad navigation system was introduced to Sydney in 1992, with six routes (Metroads 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7). The scheme was extended in 1998-1999 with the signposting of Metroads 6, 9 and 10 (there was never a Metroad 8). All Metroads in Sydney were completely replaced in 2013 with equivalent alphanumeric road markers.

====Former Metroads====

* Metroad 1 – Wahroonga to Waterfall via the M1 Eastern Distributor and the city of Sydney – Replaced by M1 and A1
* Metroad 2 – Artarmon to Windsor via the Lane Cove Tunnel and M2 – Replaced by M2 and A2
* Metroad 3 – Blakehurst to Mona Vale via Hurstville, Olympic Park, Ryde, Macquarie Park and St Ives – Replaced by the A3
* Metroad 4 – Sydney to Lapstone via Parramatta Road and the M4 – Replaced by the M4 and A4
* Metroad 5 – Sydney Airport to Campbelltown via the M5 – Replaced by the M5 and M31 Hume Motorway
* Metroad 6 – Heathcote to Carlingford via Bankstown, Lidcombe and Silverwater – Replaced by the A6
* Metroad 7 – Casula to Wahroonga via the Cumberland Highway – Replaced by A28 and M7
* Metroad 9 – Campbelltown to Windsor – Replaced by the A9
* Metroad 10 – North Sydney to Mona Vale via Mosman and Dee Why. – Replaced by A8
Sections of Metroads 1, 2, 5, and 7 formed the Sydney Orbital Network circumnavigating the Sydney metropolitan area.

===Brisbane Metroads===
Brisbane&#x27;s Metroad system employed odd numbers for north-to-south alignments and even numbers for east-to-west alignments. Most Metroads have since been completely or partially replaced with equivalent alphanumeric road markers. Brisbane is the only city currently retaining the Metroad system.

====Current Metroads====
* Metroad 2 – Rocklea to Mackenzie via Granard Road, Riawena Road, Kessels Road, and Mt Gravatt–Capalaba Road
* Metroad 5 – Toowong to Kedron via Mount Coot–Tha Road, Frederick Street, Rouen Road, Boundary Road, Macgregor Terrace, Jubilee Terrace, Elimatta Drive, Stewart Road, Wardell Street, South Pine Road, and Stafford Road

====Former Metroads====
* Metroad 1 – M1 - End of Pacific Motorway (Tugun) to Cooroy
* Metroad 2 – Cunningham Highway (National Highway 15)/Warrego Highway (National Highway A2) Junction to Gateway Motorway (Metroad 1)
* Metroad 3 – Pacific/Gateway Motorway Junction (Metroad 1) to Gympie Arterial Road/Gateway Motorway Junction (Metroad 1)
* Metroad 4 – Ipswich/Logan Motorway Junction (Metroad 2) to Pacific/Gateway Motorway Junction (Metroad 1)
* Metroad 5 – Ipswich Motorway (Metroad 2) to Gympie Road (Metroad 3)
* Metroad 6 – Logan/Gateway Motorway Junction (Metroad 4) to Pacific Motorway (Metroad 1)

<text>Wright railway station is situated on the Puffing Billy Railway, Melbourne, Australia.

It opened on 24 October 1904 as part of the Gembrook railway line. It served the Wright Forest and small township of Avonsleigh, and consisted of only a small Mallee shed and a name board.

When the Gembrook line was officially closed on 30 April 1954, the site fell into disrepair, and by the 1990s, little trace of Wright remained. However, by that time, efforts were being made to extend the railway to the entire length of the original line from Lakeside through to Gembrook. Wright was officially re-opened on 18 October 1998, but a replica of the original shed was not rebuilt until sometime later.

Trains do not normally stop at Wright.

<doc id="709074" wikidata="Q5139535" url="?curid=709074" title="Cockatoo railway station">
<text>Cockatoo railway station is situated on the Puffing Billy Railway in the town of the same name.
It opened with the line on 18 December 1900 as Devon, but was renamed Cockatoo Creek on 29 July 1901 and subsequently shortened to Cockatoo in 1904. There was originally a platform road and a loop siding, but a crossing loop was later added in between the two. A single 12ft by 20 ft timber portable station building was provided which was later extended. Other associated buildings such as toilets and a van good shed were also on the platform while a weatherboard goods shed was provided on the loop siding (No. 3 Road).

Today, the loop siding has been provided again along with the platform track, but the crossing loop is yet to be rebuilt. A platform exists which initially had a temporary non-heritage building provided for safe working purposes only, but during 2007 a heritage type building, obtained second-hand from another Victorian station, was relocated to Cockatoo. Although it is not representative of the original building, it nevertheless is a typical building of the day and now provides a more suitable safe working office than the non-heritage building previously used for this purpose, which was subsequently removed in 2009. Whilst trains normally stop at Cockatoo, very few passengers join or alight.

Plans to recreate all structures on the platform to their mid-1920s configuration are well advanced with a start to be made in the very near future.

<doc id="709076" wikidata="Q3502994" url="?curid=709076" title="Frederick H. Billings">
<text>Frederick H. Billings (September 27, 1823 – September 30, 1890) was an American lawyer, financier, and politician. He is known for his legal work on land claims during the early years of California&#x27;s statehood and his presidency of the Northern Pacific Railway from 1879 to 1881.

A native of Royalton, Vermont, Billings graduated from the University of Vermont in 1844, became an attorney, and moved to California during the 1848 California Gold Rush. He took part in the creation of a prominent law firm that handled land title cases, which were an important issue because California had been under the jurisdiction of several governments. Billings also took part in several business ventures that proved successful, and became a millionaire by the age of 30. At the start of the American Civil War, he worked diligently to keep California from seceding.

After returning to Vermont in the mid 1860s, Billings continued to practice law and take part in business ventures. He served on the boards of directors of several corporations, and was a major investor in the Northern Pacific Railway. Billings received credit for rescuing the NP after the Panic of 1873, and served as its president from 1879 to 1881. He resigned the presidency after a hostile takeover, but remained on the board of directors and saw construction of the railroad through to completion in 1883.

Billings took part in politics as a Republican. He was a candidate for governor of Vermont in 1872, and nearly won the party&#x27;s nomination. He was also a delegate to the Republican National Conventions of 1880 and 1884, where he supported George F. Edmunds for president. Billings donated millions of dollars to numerous causes and organizations, including schools, colleges, libraries, and churches.

After suffering a stroke in 1889, Billings&#x27; health deteriorated, and he died at his Woodstock, Vermont home on September 23, 1890. His body was buried at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock.

==Early life==
Billings was born in Royalton, Vermont on September 27, 1823, to Oel Billings and Sarah (Wetherbe) Billings. When he was 12, his family relocated to Woodstock, and Billings attended the schools of Royalton and Woodstock. He began attendance at Meriden, New Hampshire&#x27;s Kimball Union Academy in 1839. In 1844, he graduated from the University of Vermont (UVM) with an A.M. degree. In June 1890, UVM awarded Billings the honorary degree of LL.D.

Originally a Whig and later a Republican, from 1846 to 1848 he served as Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs (chief assistant) to Horace Eaton, the governor of Vermont. He studied law with Oliver P. Chandler and attained admission to the bar in 1848.

==Career==
===Move to California===
Billings moved to San Francisco during the California Gold Rush of 1848, where he became the city&#x27;s first land claims lawyer. One of his first clients was John Sutter. A friend Billings made on the trip introduced him to Bennet C. Riley, who served as the last military governor before California achieved statehood in 1850. Riley was favorably impressed with Billings&#x27; abilities, and appointed him San Francisco&#x27;s commissioner of deeds, chairman of the city&#x27;s board of inspectors and judges, and territorial attorney general. Billings also took part in several business activities. Upon arrival in California, he bought an old canal boat, then made a profit by quickly reselling its timbers. With this stake, he invested in other profitable ventures, including &quot;water lots&quot; -- property which was under the water of San Francisco Bay but was intended for reclamation and development.

Billings partnered with Henry Halleck, Archibald C. Peachy, and Trenor W. Park in Halleck, Peachy &amp; Billings, which became a leading law firm in San Francisco. HPB took part in two important land ownership cases, which were complex because California had been part of Mexico, so land titles were in dispute. In the first, ownership of the New Almaden quicksilver mine, Billings undertook a risky 1859 trip to Mexico City in search of documents and witnesses at a time when the city was besieged by the forces of President Benito Juárez as Juárez attempted to reclaim control of Mexico&#x27;s government. HPB lost the case despite Billings receiving praise for producing what legal observers called the most extensive and detailed research they had seen for a single land case. In the second, HPB attempted to defend the Rancho Las Mariposas claim of John C. Frémont. So many gold miners had occupied the land by the time Frémont attempted to assert his ownership that he was unable to take possession. Despite the setback, Billings and Frémont continued to work together on business opportunities including real estate and mining.

Among the other ventures in which Billings had an interest was the Overland Stage Company, of which he was an early promoter, and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, which later became the Texas and Pacific Railway. By age 30, Billings was a millionaire from his legal fees, increases in real estate values, and profits from his other enterprises, including part ownership of San Francisco&#x27;s Montgomery Block, the largest office building west of St. Louis at its 1853 opening.

During his years in San Francisco, Billings also developed a reputation for philanthropy, including donations for churches, schools, and parks. Billings was an early advocate for the conservation of Yosemite Valley for the use of future generations. He was also a trustee of the College of California (later, the University of California at Berkeley) and it was Billings who suggested that the college be named for George Berkeley.

During the late 1850s, as the United States drew closer to conflict over the slavery issue, Billings spoke tirelessly against California secession, successfully opposing a pro-slavery faction led by Democrats including William Gwin. He subsequently embarked on several trips to Europe in an unsuccessful effort to sell Frémont&#x27;s Mariposa mine shares. At the start of the American Civil War, Billings acted as Frémont&#x27;s agent when Frémont took the initiative to purchase arms in England for use by Union troops.

Upon returning to the United States in 1861, Billings met Julia Parmly in New York City. They decided to wed soon after meeting, and Billings returned to California to wind down the law firm&#x27;s business and sell some of his properties before returning to New York City to get married. Billings then returned to San Francisco; in September 1862, he was a featured speaker at a San Francisco rally to raise money for the care of sick and wounded soldiers. In October 1863, Billings was the featured speaker at a San Francisco event held to celebrate recent Union military victories. In November 1863, Billings defended several individuals who attempted to steal a schooner from San Francisco Bay, which was the first step in their plan to seize a steamship and become pro-Confederate privateers. They were convicted, but Billings succeeded in saving them from the death penalty. In December 1863, Billings left San Francisco and settled in New York City.

In 1864, California changed from electing members of the United States House of Representatives to at-large seats to electing them by Congressional district. Even though he had moved away, his pro-Union record led Republican supporters of Billings to support him for the party&#x27;s nomination in the 1st District, which included San Francisco. Donald C. McRuer was able to obtain the nomination, and went on to win the seat. Later in 1864, California Republicans wrote to President Abraham Lincoln and suggested the state was entitled to be represented in Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet because California had supported Lincoln&#x27;s reelection. They recommended Billings for an appointment and implied that Secretary of the Interior would be a suitable position. After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, California Republicans urged his successor Andrew Johnson to make the appointment. Among other complications, Billings suffered from an extended illness that prevented him from advocating on his own behalf, and he was not nominated.

===Return to Vermont===
In 1864, Billings left New York City and returned to Woodstock, where he practiced law and resumed his business interests. In late 1865, friends of Billings proposed him as a candidate for the United States Senate from California, but the nomination went to Cornelius Cole, who went on to win the seat. In 1868, Billings was an original incorporator of the New England Telegraph Company, which was chartered by the state to construct a telegraph line connecting northern and southern Vermont, and connecting Vermont to adjacent states. In 1869, he purchased George Perkins Marsh&#x27;s former estate. Billings had read Marsh&#x27;s pioneering volume on ecology called &quot;Man and Nature&quot;, and set about to put into practice his theories on conservation. Billings and his heirs purchased many failing farms and reforested much of the surrounding hillsides. This eventually led to creation of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park, which oversees and interprets what is probably the oldest managed forest in the United States. In addition, Billings&#x27; early conservation efforts led to creation of the Billings Farm and Museum, an important resource for learning about Vermont&#x27;s agricultural history.

While residing in Woodstock, Billings maintained a home in New York City so he could tend to his business interests. These included chairman of the executive committee for a corporation that planned to build a cross-isthmus canal in Nicaragua, and member of the board of directors of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. His additional directorships included several New England regional railroads, the Farmers&#x27; Loan and Trust Company, American Exchange Bank, and the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. In 1869, he was elected president of the Woodstock National Bank. In 1871, he was elected a director of the National Life Insurance Company.

Billings was also involved in civic and charitable activities, including serving on the University of Vermont&#x27;s board of trustees from 1867 to 1873. Also in 1869, Billings was one of two prominent Vermonters who paid the expenses for two Vermont schoolteachers, enabling them to provide instruction in southern states for former slaves as part of the post-Civil War Reconstruction. In 1870, Billings was elected president of the Vermont Bible Society. In 1871, he was chosen for the presidency of the Windsor County Agricultural Society. Billings also advocated for the creation of the Vermont Veterans&#x27; Home to care for former Civil War soldiers. When the Vermont General Assembly passed a bill incorporating the home in 1884, Billings was selected as an original member of its board of trustees.

===Northern Pacific Railway===
In 1869, Billings purchased from Hiram Walbridge a one-twelfth interest in the Northern Pacific Railway. He served on the board of directors beginning in 1870. Construction began in 1870, with the NP planned to run from Brainerd, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington.

Billings became the largest landholder in the area that became Billings, Montana, which was named for him. His Montana business interests expanded to include banks, mines, ranches, and local railroads that connected to the Northern Pacific. Billings also played a significant role in promoting the conservation of the area that became Yellowstone National Park, a site which was near the route of the Northern Pacific.

As chairman of the NP&#x27;s land committee, Billings was credited with overseeing development and execution of plans for using the Northern Pacific to transport white settlers to Minnesota and the Dakota Territory. When Jay Cooke &amp; Company, which was responsible for the sale of NP stock, failed in the Panic of 1873, Billings worked to rescue the railway and succeeded in saving it after bankruptcy. As a result of his efforts, after the panic began to abate, the Northern Pacific was able to restart construction. In 1879, Billings became the company&#x27;s president. He served until 1881, when Henry Villard, proponent of an alternate route to the Pacific coast, purchased a controlling interest in the Northern Pacific. Billings left the company&#x27;s presidency while remaining on the board of directors, and he was present for the ceremony in Montana that commemorated the end of construction in 1883.

===Politics===
Billings maintained an interest in Republican politics. In early 1868, a group of his friends in California attempted to mount a campaign to obtain the party&#x27;s vice presidential nomination for Billings, but this effort proved unsuccessful. In November 1868, he made a well received speech at a party campaign rally in Barnard, Vermont. Billings was mentioned as a candidate for governor in 1869, but disclaimed any interest. His name was again prominently mentioned in 1870, but Billings deferred to John Wolcott Stewart, who won the nomination and the general election.

In 1872 Billings was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Vermont. The Republican nomination was then tantamount to election, and Billings was president of the state Republican convention and had a large group of delegates pledged to him. Governor Stewart also had a strong following, but his opponents argued that re-nominating him would violate the party&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Rule&quot;, which prior to Stewart&#x27;s election to a two-year term had limited governors to two one-year terms. Delegates decided that the Mountain Rule would limit Stewart and his successors to one two-year term, and the Billings and Stewart delegates compromised on the governorship by nominating Julius Converse even though he was not an active candidate.

In 1876, Billings was again proposed as a candidate for the governorship, and again disclaimed any interest. Later that year, he took part in the Fifth Avenue Conference, a meeting organized by Carl Schurz for Republicans opposed to the perceived corruption of the Ulysses S. Grant administration and in favor of progressive measures including civil service reform. When the party nominated presidential and vice presidential candidates not connected to Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler, Billings publicly expressed satisfaction with the ticket, though illness prevented him from actively campaigning for it.

In 1880, Billings was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and made the nominating speech for presidential candidate George F. Edmunds, a U.S. Senator from Vermont, but the nomination went to James A. Garfield. Billings was a delegate again in 1884, and again supported Edmunds for president, but the nomination eventually went to James G. Blaine.

==Death and burial==
In December 1889, Billings suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed. His health rapidly declined, and Billings died in Woodstock on September 30, 1890. Among the prominent attendees at his funeral were Torrey E. Wales, George Grenville Benedict, Percival W. Clement, William Wells, and Charles A. Prouty. The bearers included James Barrett and Oliver P. Chandler. Billings was buried at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock.

==Family==
In 1862, Billings married Julia Parmly (December 3, 1835 - February 17, 1914), the daughter of Dr. Eleazer Parmly, a prominent New York City oral surgeon. They were the parents of seven children:
*Parmly Billings (February 6, 1863 – May 7, 1888)
*Laura Billings (Mrs. Frederic Schiller Lee) (August 20, 1864 – November 5, 1938)
*Frederick Billings (December 23, 1866 – May 5, 1913)
*Mary Montagu Billings (March 6, 1869 – June 14, 1951)
*Elizabeth Billings (January 3, 1871 – September 10, 1944)
*Ehrick Billings (October 17, 1872 – October 17, 1889)
*Richard Billings (January 31, 1875 – December 3, 1931)

He was the grandfather of Mary French Rockefeller, wife of Laurance Rockefeller.

Billings was the brother of Franklin Noble Billings. He was the uncle of Governor Franklin S. Billings and grand-uncle of Judge Franklin S. Billings Jr.

==Philanthropy==
Billings provided $40,000 to construct a chapel for the Congregational Church of Woodstock. Although he never owned a home in Billings, Montana, a railroad town established in 1882 and named after him, his wife provided the money to build its First Congregational Church. Frederick Billings endowed the Billings Library, completed in 1885 for the University of Vermont, and purchased the George Perkins Marsh collection of 12,000 volumes for it.

Additional Billings gifts included $50,000 to endow a professorship at Amherst College in memory of his son Parmly, who was an Amherst graduate. He also donated $50,000 to Dwight Lyman Moody&#x27;s Mount Hermon School for Boys in memory of his son Ehrick. Billings also donated money to Whitman College to enable the construction of the college&#x27;s Billings Hall as a memorial to Ehrick and Parmly Billings. In 1908, Julia Billings provided an endowment which enabled creation of Whitman&#x27;s Frederick Billings Professorship of Biblical Literature.

Billings&#x27; son Frederick Jr. provided a donation to Billings, Montana which financed construction of the Parmly Billings Memorial Library. Billings&#x27; daughter Elizabeth later provided additional funding, which was used to complete an addition to the original library.

<doc id="709078" wikidata="Q7976898" url="?curid=709078" title="Wayward Angel">
<text>Wayward Angel is the third studio album by Australian singer Kasey Chambers, released by Essence Records in Australia on 31 May 2004. Chambers wrote most of the album, three songs co-written by her then husband Corey Hopper and her brother Nash Chambers produced the album – who had previously produced her first two solo albums. The album differs from her previous two because Chambers became a mother and she states it is the &quot;most life changing things that you go through&quot; and she did not feel any pressure recording the album. It debuted on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart at number-one making it Chambers second number-one album but the sales did not match up to her previous album &quot;Barricades &amp; Brickwalls&quot; (2001) which was certified seven times platinum by ARIA.

The singles released from the album gave Chambers minor success in Australia. &quot;Hollywood&quot; was the first single released and became Chambers fifth top forty hit in Australia. &quot;Pony&quot; was released at the start of 2005 and became Chambers third top ten single in Australia. The last single released was &quot;Saturated&quot; and was a minor hit peaking in the top one hundred. The album saw Chambers nominated for four ARIA Awards including Best Cover Art, Album of the Year, Best Country Album and Best Female Artist in 2004.

==Writing and content==
The album saw Chambers co-write with her then husband Corey Hopper. These tracks include &quot;Follow You Home&quot;, &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot; and &quot;More Than Ordinary?&quot; about a rejected lover. She states &quot;It was good fun writing with him [Hopper] because I don&#x27;t normally co-write. I have tried to do it in the past. I&#x27;ve done a little bit of songwriting with my dad and one of my mates. I found it a lot more comfortable writing with someone I know really well. You are pouring your heart out and giving them your deepest darkest secret and feelings. It is hard to sit down with a total stranger and do that. None of the songs I wrote with Corey were planned moments. We just sat down and they feel out.&quot; Chambers recorded seventeen songs for the album and only fourteen made it onto the album Since most of her favourite albums contained twelve tracks she wanted that many tracks on the album but then realised she could not part with any of them.

The title track &quot;Wayward Angel&quot; was written about Chambers son Talon Jordi and states the song&#x27;s meaning is she will not always be perfect but she will always be there for him. The song &quot;Paper Aeroplane&quot; was about a man losing his wife to cancer, she states &quot;I was watching television one night and there was an interview with an old man who had lost his wife to cancer. It was just a really beautiful story in the way he told it and remembered her. It was just moving enough for me to sit down and write that song.&quot; The first track &quot;Pony&quot; features baritone guitar by Steuart Smith who has also worked with the Eagles and Shawn Colvin.

==Reception==
The album debuted at number-one on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 7 June 2004 with sales of 25,885 copies, knocking &quot;Under My Skin&quot; by Avril Lavigne off the top spot. It was certified platinum by ARIA on its first week and also topped the Australian Country Chart, knocking her previous album off number-one. The album went to spend five weeks at number-one being knocked off to number five by &quot;For All You&#x27;ve Done&quot; by Hillsong Church and it spent thirty-six weeks in the top fifty, re-entering five times. &quot;Wayward Angel&quot; spent fifty-four weeks in the albums top one hundred, certified triple platinum by ARIA, was the twentieth highest selling album in Australia for 2004 and the eighty-second highest selling album in Australia for 2005. The album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 but peaked at number thirty-one of the Top Country Albums spending eight weeks in the charts.

AllMusic stated that Chambers &quot;manages the not-unremarkable accomplishment of splitting the difference between Emmylou Harris&#x27;s crystalline purity and Lucinda Williams&#x27;s rough-hewn emotional honesty&quot;. They also state that her &quot;songwriting is no less remarkable, and connects in much the same way, chronicling matters of the heart and soul in a manner that achieves a genuine and unaffected beauty with just a dash of the truthful messiness that comes with being human&quot;.

===Accolades===
The album and its tracks received four ARIA Award nominations. All of the ARIA Awards were at the 2004 awards:

*Album of the Year – awarded to &quot;Get Born&quot; by Jet

<text>Fielder railway station is situated on the Puffing Billy Railway in Australia.

It opened as a Stopping Place on Monday 10 September 1928, as part of the Gembrook railway line. It was originally an unnamed platform, with time tables noting a station at . In 1929, local Harry Watson constructed a Mallee shed and unofficially named it Ancaster after his home town in Lincolnshire, England, but this was quickly changed by some children to Laura, who was a young local girl. The Victorian Railways officially named it Fielder from Tuesday 5 February 1929, after a nearby resident. It was planned to name the station after the two local residents Cullen and Fielder and combinations of the two names were suggested, however Fielder was the name finally chosen. It remained nothing more than a Mallee shed with small office and a name board for the rest of its operating life.

It was closed with the line on 30 April 1954 and the Mallee shed was sold to US Buslines for unknown use. After closure, the site fell into disrepair, and by the 1990s, little trace of Fielder remained. However, by that time, efforts were being made to extend the railway from Lakeside through to Gembrook, which would complete the entire length of the original line. In 1996, a group of volunteers led by Richard Schurmann in collaboration with the descendants of the Fielder family rebuilt the platform and waiting shed, which was officially re-opened on Saturday 19 April 1997 in preparation for the extension of the line which re-opened in 1998.

On 18 November 2012 a plaque was unveiled on the station shed in tribute to the Fielder Family.

Trains do not normally stop at Fielder.

<text>Gembrook railway station is located in the township of Gembrook in Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne. It was opened with the line on 18 December 1900 and closed on 30 April 1954.

The line was rebuilt to the Gembrook terminus in 1998 by the Puffing Billy Railway. Heritage steam trains operated by Puffing Billy now stop at a new &quot;Town&quot; platform located on the site of a former siding. A &quot;heritage&quot; station has also been constructed on the site of the original Gembrook station. It has a layout very similar to that of the station in the 1920s, with only minor alterations to meet modern requirements.

<doc id="709091" wikidata="Q7691110" url="?curid=709091" title="Tea and Sympathy (play)">
<text>Tea and Sympathy is a 1953 stage play in three acts by Robert Anderson about a male private school student, Tom Lee, who faces accusations of homosexuality. A woman, Laura, who is married to an instructor, opposes the students&#x27; shaming of Lee and romantically pursues him so he can prove that he has a masculine character. The title refers to what someone in Laura&#x27;s position was supposed to offer a boy such as Tom.

Everett Evans of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;one of the first plays to tackle the then-taboo topic of sexual orientation and related prejudice.&quot; Evans stated that the play&#x27;s final line, &quot;Years from now, when you speak of this, and you will, be kind,&quot; is &quot;one of the most quoted curtain lines in stage history&quot;.

==Characters==
* Tom Lee – A student at a New England preparatory school who is accused of being effeminate and is targeted after sunbathing with a male professor.
* Bill Reynolds – The head of Tom Lee&#x27;s dormitory house, Bill is hyper-masculine and in conflict with Tom. He prefers activities with the boys to spending time with his wife, Laura, from whom he is distant. Everett Evans of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that Bill married Laura &quot;apparently&quot; because colleagues pressured him into doing so, and that &quot;The play suggests Bill&#x27;s persecution of Tom stems from doubts about his own masculinity.&quot;
* Laura Reynolds – Bill&#x27;s wife, Laura assists Tom and helps him during his troubles.

==Productions==
===Broadway===
The play premiered on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on September 30, 1953, in a production by The Playwrights&#x27; Company, directed by Elia Kazan with scenic and lighting design by Jo Mielziner. The play starred Deborah Kerr, Leif Erickson, and John Kerr, who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Tom Lee. It transferred to the Longacre Theatre, and later the 48th Street Theatre. The play closed on June 18, 1955, after 712 performances. In the summer of 1954, Joan Fontaine and Anthony Perkins replaced Deborah Kerr and John Kerr in their respective roles.

===London===
The play was first performed in London at the Comedy Theatre (Harold Pinter Theatre since 2011), under membership conditions, because the Lord Chamberlain had imposed an outright ban. The New Watergate Club was founded in 1956 for the staging of plays previously suppressed under the Theatres Act 1843. By these means, the theatre premiered &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; in the United Kingdom.

===Paris===
A French adaptation was presented in 1956 at the Théâtre de Paris, Paris, starring Ingrid Bergman and Jean-Loup Phillipe and directed by Jean Mercure.

===Off-Broadway===
The play was presented Off-Broadway by the Keen Company at the Clurman Theater, from March 6, 2007, to April 14, 2007. Directed by Jonathan Silverstein the cast featured Heidi Armbruster (Laura Reynolds), Dan McCabe (Tom Lee) and Craig Mathers (Bill Reynolds).

==Adaptations==
The play was adapted into a 1956 film. In 1956, Bob Thomas of the Associated Press wrote that &quot;many said [the play] could never be made into a movie.&quot;

==Reception==
In his New York Times review of the original 1953 production, Brooks Atkinson called it an &quot;uncommonly discerning study of character&quot; and &quot;the first big popular success of the season&quot;.

In 2013, Everett Evans of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;Sixty years on, this once controversial play is a little dated, but a lot more timely, its potent moments outweighing its imperfections. When you speak of &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, be kind.&quot;

<doc id="709092" wikidata="Q556965" url="?curid=709092" title="Floral symmetry">
<text>Floral symmetry describes whether, and how, a flower, in particular its perianth, can be divided into two or more identical or mirror-image parts.

Uncommonly, flowers may have no axis of symmetry at all, typically because their parts are spirally arranged.

== Actinomorphic ==

Most flowers are actinomorphic (&quot;star shaped&quot;, &quot;radial&quot;), meaning they can be divided into three or more identical sectors which are related to each other by rotation about the center of the flower. Typically, each sector might contain one tepal or one petal and one sepal and so on. It may or may not be possible to divide the flower into symmetrical halves by the same number of longitudinal planes passing through the axis: oleander is an example of a flower without such mirror planes. Actinomorphic flowers are also called radially symmetrical or regular flowers. Other examples of actinomorphic flowers are the lily (&quot;Lilium&quot;, Liliaceae) and the buttercup (&quot;Ranunculus&quot;, Ranunculaceae).

== Zygomorphic ==
Zygomorphic (&quot; shaped&quot;, &quot;bilateral&quot; – from the Greek ζυγόν, &quot;zygon&quot;, yoke, and μορφή, &quot;morphe&quot;, shape) flowers can be divided by only a single plane into two mirror-image halves, much like a yoke or a person&#x27;s face. Examples are orchids and the flowers of most members of the Lamiales (e.g., Scrophulariaceae and Gesneriaceae). Some authors prefer the term monosymmetry or bilateral symmetry. The asymmetry allows pollen to be deposited in specific locations on pollinating insects and this specificity can result in evolution of new species.

Globally and within individual networks, zygomorphic flowers are a minority. Plants with zygomorphic flowers have smaller number of visitor species compared to those with actinomorphic flowers. Sub-networks of plants with zygomorphic flowers share greater connectance, greater asymmetry and lower coextinction robustness for both the plants and the visitor species. Plant taxa with zygomorphic flowers can have a greater risk of extinction due to pollinator decline.

== Asymmetry ==
A few plant species have flowers lacking any symmetry, and therefore having a &quot;handedness&quot;. Examples: &quot;Valeriana officinalis&quot; and &quot;Canna indica&quot;.

== Differences ==
Actinomorphic flowers are a basal angiosperm character; zygomorphic flowers are a derived character that has evolved many times.

Some familiar and seemingly actinomorphic so-called flowers, such as those of daisies and dandelions (Asteraceae), and most species of &quot;Protea&quot;, are actually clusters of tiny (not necessarily actinomorphic) flowers arranged into a roughly radially symmetric inflorescence of the form known as a head, capitulum, or pseudanthium.

== Peloria ==

Peloria or a peloric flower is the aberration in which a plant that normally produces zygomorphic flowers produces actinomorphic flowers instead. This aberration can be developmental, or it can have a genetic basis: the CYCLOIDEA gene controls floral symmetry. Peloric &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; plants have been produced by knocking out this gene. Many modern cultivars of &quot;Sinningia speciosa&quot; (&quot;gloxinia&quot;) have been bred to have peloric flowers as they are larger and showier than the normally zygomorphic flowers of this species.

Charles Darwin explored peloria in &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; (snapdragon) while researching the inheritance of floral characteristics for his &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;. Later research, using &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot;, showed that his results were largely in line with Mendelian theory.

<text>Moorooduc railway station is located on Two Bays Road, Mount Eliza, Victoria, Australia. The station is home to the Mornington Railway Preservation Society. Adjacent to the station is the Mount Eliza Regional Park which incorporates the Moorooduc Quarry Flora and Fauna Reserve.
Moorooduc station has one platform, which terminates services on the line.
Only one track is currently used for services, with the other five are for train maintenance, storage, repairs and locomotives changing ends.

==Facilities==
Moorooduc station has a heritage signal box obtained from the now defunct Somerton Station (now Roxburgh Park).
Currently, it is not used and is open for free inspection by passengers.

A toilet block was installed in 2013.
A dock is present but is mainly used for renovations and maintenance.
A footbridge from the now closed Fitzroy Station is also at the station.

== Future plans ==
The Mornington Railway Preservation Society (operators of Mornington Railway) have worked to restore the old train line that continues over the Moorooduc highway adjacent to the station and into an area that has returned to vegetation. The track runs all the way past Peninsula Link and into Baxter station. A few kilometres down the line is a possible proposed Sumner Road station, but the outcome of the project will vary, especially in terms of money. The railway line will continue and join onto the Stony Point railway line and then terminate at Baxter.

<text>Tanti Park railway station is a single platform station located on Bungower Road, Mornington, Victoria, Australia. It is the middle stop of three currently serviced by the tourist Mornington Railway.

Tanti Park opened on 18 June 1936 as Mornington Racecourse Platform. It opened for general traffic on 12 April 1969, and was renamed Tanti Park on 19 December of that year. The current platform was provided in late 1977. Flashing light signals were also provided at the Bungower Road level crossing, located at the up end of the platform, in that year.

Since mid-2009, the station has been unmanned. It is now a pickup and drop-off point for passengers travelling on the tourist railway. The ticket office is still present, but is not used. The former Narambi Station was relocated across the road from Tanti Park.

<text>Yarra Glen is the city-end terminus of the Yarra Valley Railway, which operates over part of the former Healesville railway line.

== History ==

The first station on the site was built in 1888–1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville. The settlement had been previously named Burgoyne, but when the railway was extended, the decision was made to rename it Yarra Glen. Though Yarra Glen was a small settlement, its station was often used for supplying Melbourne with produce from nearby farms.

The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, and suffered some major fire damage to the roof. However, the station is being restored by the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based at Healesville railway station. The railway is currently open on weekends and public holidays, offering return trips from Healesville through the tunnel near Tarrawarra and back, using Walker railmotor RM22.

The Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009 burnt a good deal of grassland and forest in the Yarra Valley. The fire also caused the destruction of 13 timber trestle bridges between Yarra Glen Station and Healesville. Bridges of varying lengths were lost, the main ones being those on the Yarra River flats, including a long one over the river itself. The bridges, between Yarra Glen and Yering, are visible from the Melba Highway when approaching Yarra Glen. Six other bridges were destroyed, which were not part of the Yarra Valley Railway, and sleepers were burnt out over approx 2 km, also outside the running section of the railway. Until the 13 bridges and associated rail track can be restored to operating condition, Yarra Glen station is orphaned from the remaining part of the Yarra Valley Railway. Rebuilding progressed quickly during 2015, to the point where the reconstructed bridges, this time in concrete and steel, are clearly visible from the road close by.

Yarra Glen Station is being rebuilt from the ground up by dedicated volunteers, including the Yarra Glen Men&#x27;s Shed, and the finished building will closely match its original design. It was scheduled to be completed in 2017. Work has since been completed on this project.

With the Black Saturday bushfires, it destroyed the timber bridges between Yarra Glen and Coldstream, the possible future reinstatement of railway services to Lilydale has been made highly improbable, because it would require a considerable amount of money and time.

<text>Tarrawarra was a station on the former Healesville line between Yarra Glen and Healesville stations, in Victoria, Australia. The station opened in 1889 and closed along with the line in December 1980. In the 1970s, timetables showed that the station was a flag stop because of the small number of passengers using the station.

== History ==

The section of track through the location of the station is now maintained by the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based at Healesville. A tourist service operates on weekends, and school and public holidays, using a restored Walker railmotor, to the rear of the Tarrawarra Estate Winery, just through the tunnel about 3 km east of the former station. 

Tarrawarra station is expected to become a crossing loop when the station reopens as part of the restoration of the line to Yarra Glen. Work has commenced to replace the wooden bridges between the station and Yarra Glen, which were burned in the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. Currently the Tarrawarra yard is being used as a major staging area for the restoration project.

<text>Healesville is a railway station in Victoria, Australia. Formerly the terminus of the Healesville railway line, it is currently the principal station of the heritage Yarra Valley Railway. A temporary station was built on the site in 1888–1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville. The current station was built in 1903 and is now listed with Heritage Victoria.

== History ==

The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, but has now been restored as part of the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based out of Healesville. It currently opens on weekends, Wednesdays of school holidays, and public holidays. Walker railmotor, RM22, runs approximately 4.5 km to near the TarraWarra Estate winery, after travelling through an historic tunnel.

The Yarra Valley Railway aims to restore the line from Healesville to Yarra Glen railway station. The Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009 destroyed 13 timber trestle bridges between Healesville and Yarra Glen stations, which was a major setback in doing that.

Boom gates were installed at the Healesville-Kinglake Road level crossing in September 2022, along with the reconstruction of the level crossing.

Healesville station is now served by the route 685 bus, which runs between Lilydale and Healesville, and is operated by McKenzie&#x27;s Tourist Services, under contract to Public Transport Victoria.

==Film and TV==
Healesville railway station served as the location for the town&#x27;s station, in the long-running ABC TV serial &quot;Bellbird&quot;. The Internet Movie Database lists the station as a filming location for the Australian short film &quot;Harry&#x27;s War&quot; (1999). The station was used in the railway station scene in John D. Lamond&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Ozploitation&quot; film, &quot;Felicity&quot;.

<doc id="709116" wikidata="Q4166054" url="?curid=709116" title="Singular value">
<text>In mathematics, in particular functional analysis, the singular values of a compact operator formula_1 acting between Hilbert spaces formula_2 and formula_3, are the square roots of the (necessarily non-negative) eigenvalues of the self-adjoint operator formula_4 (where formula_5 denotes the adjoint of formula_6).

The singular values are non-negative real numbers, usually listed in decreasing order (&quot;σ&quot;1(&quot;T&quot;), &quot;σ&quot;2(&quot;T&quot;), …). The largest singular value &quot;σ&quot;1(&quot;T&quot;) is equal to the operator norm of &quot;T&quot; (see Min-max theorem).

If &quot;T&quot; acts on Euclidean space formula_7, there is a simple geometric interpretation for the singular values: Consider the image by formula_6 of the unit sphere; this is an ellipsoid, and the lengths of its semi-axes are the singular values of formula_6 (the figure provides an example in formula_10).

The singular values are the absolute values of the eigenvalues of a normal matrix &quot;A&quot;, because the spectral theorem can be applied to obtain unitary diagonalization of formula_11 as formula_12. Therefore, 

Most norms on Hilbert space operators studied are defined using singular values. For example, the Ky Fan-&quot;k&quot;-norm is the sum of first &quot;k&quot; singular values, the trace norm is the sum of all singular values, and the Schatten norm is the &quot;p&quot;th root of the sum of the &quot;p&quot;th powers of the singular values. Note that each norm is defined only on a special class of operators, hence singular values can be useful in classifying different operators.

In the finite-dimensional case, a matrix can always be decomposed in the form formula_13, where formula_14 and formula_15 are unitary matrices and formula_16 is a rectangular diagonal matrix with the singular values lying on the diagonal. This is the singular value decomposition.

== Basic properties ==

Relation to trace:

:formula_27.

If formula_28 is full rank, the product of singular values is formula_29.

If formula_30 is full rank, the product of singular values is formula_31.

If formula_11 is square and full rank, the product of singular values is formula_33.

If formula_11 is normal, then formula_35, that is, its singular values are the absolute values of its eigenvalues.

For a generic rectangular matrix formula_11, let formula_37 be its augmented matrix. It has eigenvalues formula_38 (where formula_39 are the singular values of formula_40) and the remaining eigenvalues are zero. Let formula_41 be the singular value decomposition, then the eigenvectors of formula_42 are formula_43 for formula_44
== The smallest singular value ==
The smallest singular value of a matrix &quot;A&quot; is &quot;σ&quot;n(&quot;A&quot;). It has the following properties for a non-singular matrix A:

* The 2-norm of the inverse matrix (A−1) equals the inverse &quot;σ&quot;n−1(&quot;A&quot;).
* The absolute values of all elements in the inverse matrix (A−1) are at most the inverse &quot;σ&quot;n−1(&quot;A&quot;).

Intuitively, if &quot;σ&quot;n(&quot;A&quot;) is small, then the rows of A are &quot;almost&quot; linearly dependent. If it is &quot;σ&quot;n(&quot;A&quot;) = 0, then the rows of A are linearly dependent and A is not invertible.

== History ==
This concept was introduced by Erhard Schmidt in 1907. Schmidt called singular values &quot;eigenvalues&quot; at that time. The name &quot;singular value&quot; was first quoted by Smithies in 1937. In 1957, Allahverdiev proved the following characterization of the &quot;n&quot;th singular number: 
: formula_71

This formulation made it possible to extend the notion of singular values to operators in Banach space. 
Note that there is a more general concept of &quot;s-numbers&quot;, which also includes Gelfand and Kolmogorov width.

<text>Bergenia (elephant-eared saxifrage, elephant&#x27;s ears) is a genus of ten species of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae, native to central Asia, from Afghanistan to China and the Himalayan region.

==Description==
They are clump-forming, rhizomatous, evergreen perennials with a spirally arranged rosette of leaves 6–35 cm long and 4–15 cm broad, and pink flowers produced in a cyme. The leaves are large, leathery, ovate or cordate, and often have wavy or saw-toothed edges. For most of the year, the leaves have a glossy green colour, but in cooler climates, they turn red or bronze in the fall. The flowers grow on a stem similar in colour to a rhubarb stalk and most varieties have cone-shaped flowers in varying shades of pink. These can range from almost white to ruby red and purple.

The common names for &quot;Bergenia&quot; are pigsqueak (due to the sound produced when two leaves are rubbed together), elephant&#x27;s ears (due to the shape of the leaves) and large rockfoil.

&quot;Bergenia&quot; is closely related to &quot;Mukdenia&quot;, &quot;Oresitrophe&quot;, &quot;Astilboides&quot; and &quot;Rodgersia&quot;.

The creator of the taxonomic genus name, Conrad Moench, honoured the German botanist and physician Karl August von Bergen by coining the name &quot;Bergenia&quot; in 1794.

==Species==

10 species are accepted.
* &quot;Bergenia ciliata&quot; – western Himalayas to southwestern Nepal. Has cultivar &quot;Bergenia ciliata&quot; &#x27;Superba&#x27;.
* &quot;Bergenia crassifolia&quot; (syn. &quot;Bergenia cordifolia&quot;) – Kazakhstan and western Siberia to Mongolia, the Russian Far East, and Korea. The most widely grown garden plant, especially the cultivar &quot;Bergenia cordifolia&quot; &#x27;Purpurea.&#x27; The species epithet &quot;crassifolia&quot; means thick-leaved, and &quot;cordifolia&quot; means cordate (heart-shaped) leaf (although the leaves may also be described as spoon-shaped). It grows to about 30 cm tall. The leaves are winter hardy and change color in the range of rust brown to brown-red. Other cultivars are &quot;Bergenia cordifolia&quot; &#x27;Winterglut&#x27;, &quot;Bergenia cordifolia&quot; &#x27;Senior&#x27;, and &quot;Bergenia crassifolia&quot; &#x27;Autumn Red&#x27;.
* &quot;Bergenia emeiensis&quot; – central Sichuan province of south-central China
* &quot;Bergenia hissarica&quot; – west Hisiar in Uzbekistan
* &quot;Bergenia pacumbis&quot; (synonym &quot;Bergenia ligulata&quot; ) – eastern Afghanistan to the Himalayas, Myanmar, and south-central China (western Yunnan).
* &quot;Bergenia purpurascens&quot; – central Himalayas to Myanmar and south-central China (southwestern Sichuan and northern Yunnan). 30 – 40 cm tall with carmine-red flowers. Leaves are oval-shaped.
**&quot;Bergenia purpurascens&quot; var. &quot;delavayi&quot; is ca. 50 cm tall with small leaves and rosy red flowers.
* &quot;Bergenia scopulosa&quot; – southern Shaanxi Province of central China
* &quot;Bergenia stracheyi&quot; – eastern Afghanistan to Tajikistan, southwestern Tibet, and Nepal. Has cultivars &quot;Bergenia stracheyi&quot; &#x27;Alba&#x27; and &quot;Bergenia stracheyi&quot; &#x27;Afghanica&#x27;
* &quot;Bergenia tianquanensis&quot; – central Sichuan Province in China
* &quot;Bergenia ugamica&quot; – eastern Uzbekistan

==Cultivation==
&quot;Bergenia&quot; are hardy plants that can grow in climates with extreme temperature ranges from about to . They prefer sun but will grow in shady areas as well. Plants can grow to about tall and wide. They do well in most soils, but moist, humus-rich soil is preferable. Exposure and dry soils tend to stunt growth, but can enhance the winter leaf colours. In areas with cold, strong winter winds, protection from the wind may be required. They are propagated by division or rooted rhizome sections.
&quot;Bergenia crassifolia&quot;, &quot;Bergenia cordifolia&quot;, and various hybrids are often grown in gardens, with several cultivars selected.

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

*&quot;B. cordifolia&quot; &#x27;Rosa Zeiten&#x27; 
*&quot;B. purpurascens&quot; 
*&quot;B. purpurascens&quot; var. &quot;delavayi&quot; 
*&#x27;Biedermeier&#x27; 
*&#x27;Bressingham White&#x27; 
*&#x27;Britten&#x27; 
*&#x27;Claire Maxine&#x27; 
*&#x27;Eden&#x27;s Magic Giant&#x27; 
*&#x27;Eric Smith&#x27; 
*&#x27;Eroica&#x27; 
*&#x27;Frau Holle&#x27; (pale pink)
*&#x27;Sunningdale&#x27; 
*&#x27;Irish Crimson&#x27; 
*&#x27;Morgenröte&#x27; 
*&#x27;Pugsley&#x27;s Pink&#x27; 
*&#x27;Silberlicht&#x27; 
*&#x27;Wintermärchen&#x27; 
==Pests and diseases==
Bergenia are robust plants and generally free of problems, although vine weevil adults readily eat the edges of the leaves, resulting in an indented, &#x27;notched&#x27; outline which can detract from the appearance of the plant.

==Uses==
Bergenin, C-glycoside of 4-O-methyl gallic acid, and its O-demethylated derivative norbergenin, are chemical compounds and drugs of Ayurveda, commonly known as Paashaanbhed. They can be isolated from &quot;Bergenia ciliata&quot; and &quot;Bergenia ligulata&quot; and from rhizomes of &quot;Bergenia stracheyi&quot;. It shows a potent immunomodulatory effect.

<text>Sekou Sundiata (August 22, 1948 – July 18, 2007) was an African-American poet and performer, as well as a teacher at The New School in New York City. His students include musicians Ani DiFranco and Mike Doughty. His plays include &quot;The Circle Unbroken is a Hard Bop&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Love&quot;, &quot;Udu&quot;, and &quot;The 51st Dream State&quot;. He also released several albums, including &quot;Longstoryshort&quot; and &quot;The Blue Oneness of Dreams&quot;. The &quot;Blue Oneness of Dreams&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 2000 Sundiata received the Creative Capital Performing Arts Award.

His subjects included Jimi Hendrix, Nelson Mandela, and reparations for slavery.

Sundiata was a Sundance Institute Screenwriting Fellow, a Columbia University Revson Fellow, a Master Artist-in-Residence at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in Florida, the first Writer-in-Residence at The New School university in New York, and a professor at Eugene Lang College. He was a featured poet on two occasions at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival, most recently in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Sekou Sundiata was born Robert Franklin Feaster in Harlem, New York, but changed his name in the late 1960s to honor his African heritage. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from the City College of New York in 1972, before successfully undertaking a master&#x27;s degree in creative writing from the City University of New York.

==Performance==

In 1977, Sundiata together with poets including Rashidah Ismaili, Sandra Maria Esteves, Akua Lezli Hope, Mervyn Taylor and others formed the Calabash Poets Workshop, regularly producing events.

Sundiata&#x27;s works combined poetry, music and drama. His musical influences included jazz, blues, funk and rhythms. He worked closely with Craig Harris on works such as &quot;Udu&quot;, about slavery in modern Mauritania, and &quot;The Circle Unbroken is a Hard Bop&quot; about African Americans reaching adulthood in the 1960s.

Sundiata based his one-man show &quot;Blessing the Boats&quot; on experiences of heroin addiction (back in the 60s), a car crash and a kidney transplant from a friend. He toured the show around the United States and internationally. The impact of the show inspired members of the audience to volunteer to become organ donors.

His last work, &quot;the 51st (dream) state&quot;, featured music, dance, video and poetry about the responses to the September 11, 2001 attacks. After a performance at the Melbourne Festival, the show was performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in November 2006.

==Recorded works==
Sundiata recorded a number of works. His first album, &quot;The Blue Oneness of Dreams&quot; (Mouth Almighty Records 1997) was nominated for a Grammy. He toured with Ani DiFranco on her Rhythm and News tour in 2001 and his &quot;longstoryshort&quot; album was released on DiFranco&#x27;s Righteous Babe label.

Sundiata&#x27;s work was featured on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Def Poetry&quot; series and PBS&#x27;s &quot;The Language of Life&quot;.

==Teaching career==
Sundiata taught writing at The New School in New York City. DiFranco was one of his students and claimed at the time of his death that Sundiata &quot;taught me everything I know about poetry.&quot;

Mike Doughty also studied under Sundiata in DiFranco&#x27;s class. He wrote &quot;Screenwriter&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which was a minor hit for his band Soul Coughing in the 1990s, while studying in Sundiata&#x27;s class.

Another musician/poet who studied with Sundiata (at Eugene Lang College at The New School for Liberal Arts) was Spin Doctors&#x27; lead singer Chris Barron. In fact, it was Sekou that coined the name &quot;Spin Doctors&quot; for the newly formed band in 1988/89.

==Death==
Sekou Sundiata died of heart failure at a hospital in Valhalla, New York on July 18, 2007. He had struggled with many life-threatening conditions throughout his life, including cancer, kidney failure, a kidney transplant, pneumonia, and a broken neck sustained in an auto accident.

<doc id="709128" wikidata="Q161398" url="?curid=709128" title="Force majeure">
<text>In contract law, force majeure ( ; ) is a common clause in contracts which essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, epidemic, or sudden legal change prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. Force majeure often includes events described as an act of God, though such events remain legally distinct from the clause itself. In practice, most force majeure clauses do not entirely excuse a party&#x27;s non-performance but suspend it for the duration of the force majeure.

Force majeure is generally intended to include occurrences beyond the reasonable control of a party, and therefore would not cover:
*Any result of the negligence or malfeasance of a party, which has a materially adverse effect on the ability of such party to perform its obligations.
*Any result of the usual and natural consequences of external forces. To illuminate this distinction, take the example of an outdoor public event abruptly called off: 
**If the cause for cancellation is ordinary predictable rain, this is most probably not force majeure.
**If the cause is a flash flood that damages the venue or makes the event hazardous to attend, then this almost certainly is force majeure, other than where the venue was on a known flood plain or the area of the venue was known to be subject to torrential rain.
**Some causes might be arguable borderline cases (for instance, if unusually heavy rain occurred, rendering the event significantly more difficult, but not impossible, to safely hold or attend); these must be assessed in light of the circumstances.
*Any circumstances that are specifically contemplated (included) in the contract—for example, if the contract for the outdoor event specifically permits or requires cancellation in the event of rain.

Under international law, it refers to an irresistible force or unforeseen event beyond the control of a state, making it materially impossible to fulfill an international obligation. Accordingly, it is related to the concept of a state of emergency.

Force majeure in any given situation is controlled by the law governing the contract, rather than general concepts of force majeure. Contracts often specify what constitutes force majeure via a clause in the agreement. So, the liability is decided per contract and neither by statute nor principles of general law. The first step to assess whether—and how—force majeure applies to any particular contract is to ascertain the law of the country (state) which governs the contract.

==Purpose==
Time-critical and other sensitive contracts may be drafted to limit the shield of this clause where a party does not take reasonable steps (or specific precautions) to prevent or limit the &quot;effects&quot; of the outside interference, either when they become likely or when they actually occur. A force majeure may work to excuse all or part of the obligations of one or both parties. For example, a strike might prevent timely delivery of goods, but not timely payment for the portion delivered.

A force majeure may also be the overpowering force itself, which prevents the fulfillment of a contract. In that instance, it is actually the impossibility or impracticability defenses.

In the military, &quot;force majeure&quot; has a slightly different meaning. It refers to an event, either external or internal, that happens to a vessel or aircraft that allows it to enter normally restricted areas without penalty. An example would be the Hainan Island incident where a U.S. Navy aircraft landed at a Chinese military airbase after a collision with a Chinese fighter in April 2001. Under the principle of force majeure, the aircraft was allowed to land without interference. Similarly, the 2023 Chinese balloon incident in which a Chinese surveillance balloon was discovered in US air space, the Chinese government stated that this &quot;was entirely an accident caused by force majeure&quot;.

The importance of the force majeure clause in a contract, particularly one of any length in time, cannot be overstated as it relieves a party from an obligation under the contract (or suspends that obligation). What is permitted to be a force majeure event or circumstance can be the source of much controversy in the negotiation of a contract and a party should generally resist any attempt by the other party to include something that should, fundamentally, be at the risk of that other party. For example, in a coal-supply agreement, the mining company may seek to have &quot;geological risk&quot; included as a force majeure event; however, the mining company should be doing extensive exploration and analysis of its geological reserves and should not even be negotiating a coal-supply agreement if it cannot take the risk that there may be a geological limit to its coal supply from time to time. The outcome of that negotiation, of course, depends on the relative bargaining power of the parties and there will be cases where force majeure clauses can be used by a party effectively to escape liability for bad performance.

Because of the different interpretations of force majeure across legal systems, it is common for contracts to include specific definitions of force majeure, particularly at the international level. Some systems limit force majeure to an Act of God (such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.) but exclude human or technical failures (such as acts of war, terrorist activities, labor disputes, or interruption or failure of electricity or communications systems). The advisory point is in drafting of contract make distinction between &quot;act of God&quot; and other shape of force majeure.

As a consequence, force majeure in areas prone to natural disaster requires a definition of the magnitude of the event for which force majeure could be considered as such in a contract. As an example, in a highly seismic area a technical definition of the amplitude of motion at the site could be established on the contract, based for example on probability of occurrence studies. This parameter or parameters can later be monitored at the construction site (with a commonly agreed procedure). An earthquake could be a small shaking or damaging event. The occurrence of an earthquake does not imply the occurrence of damage or disruption. For small and moderate events it is reasonable to establish requirements for the contract processes; for large events it is not always feasible or economical to do so. Concepts such as &#x27;damaging earthquake&#x27; in force majeure clauses do not help to clarify disruption, especially in areas where there are no other reference structures or most structures are not seismically safe.

== Common law ==
===Hong Kong===
When force majeure has not been provided for in the contract (or the relevant event does not fall within the scope of the force majeure clause), and a supervening event prevents performance, it will be a breach of contract. The law of frustration will be the sole remaining course available to the party in default to end the contract. If the failure to perform the contract deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract it will be a repudiatory breach, entitling the innocent party to terminate the contract and claim damages for that repudiatory breach.
===England===
As interpreted by English courts, the phrase force majeure has a more extensive meaning than &quot;act of God&quot; or &quot;vis major.&quot; Judges have agreed that strikes and breakdowns of machinery, which though normally not included in &quot;vis major,&quot; are included in force majeure. (However, in the case of machinery breakdown, negligent lack of maintenance may negate claims of force majeure, as maintenance or its lack is within the owner&#x27;s sphere of control.)

The term cannot, however, be extended to cover delays caused by bad weather, football matches, or a funeral: the English case of &quot;Matsoukis v. Priestman &amp; Co&quot; (1915) held that &quot;these are the usual incidents interrupting work, and the defendants, in making their contract, no doubt took them into account... The words &#x27;force majeure&#x27; are not words which we generally find in an English contract. They are taken from the Code Napoleon, and they were inserted by this Romanian gentleman or by his advisers, who were no doubt familiar with their use on the Continent.&quot; In &quot;Hackney Borough Council v. Dore&quot; (1922) it was held that &quot;The expression means some physical or material restraint and does not include a reasonable fear or apprehension of such a restraint&quot;.
===India===
In re &quot;Dharnrajmal Gobindram v. Shamji Kalidas&quot; [All India Reporter 1961 Supreme Court (of India) 1285], it was held that &quot;An analysis of ruling on the subject shows that reference to the expression is made where the intention is to save the defaulting party from the consequences of anything over which he had no control.&quot;

Even if a force majeure clause covers the relevant supervening event, the party unable to perform will not have the benefit of the clause where performance merely become (1) more difficult, (2) more expensive, and/or (3) less profitable.
===United States===
For example, parties in the United States have used the COVID-19 pandemic as a force majeure in an attempt to escape contractual liability by applying the elements of an (1) unforeseeable event, (2) outside of the parties’ control, that (3) renders performance impossible or impractical. Though force majeure events are generally thought to include natural events like tornadoes and often unforeseeable man-made events like labor strikes, the 2021–2023 Inflation Surge is also impacting force majeure provisions in leasing and other real estate contracts to include delays or excuses from performing contractual obligations due to the increased costs from rising inflation and rising interest rates. 

== Civil law ==

===France===
For a defendant to invoke in French law, the event proposed as force majeure must pass three tests:
# Externality: The defendant must have nothing to do with the event&#x27;s happening.
# Unpredictability: If the event could be foreseen, the defendant is obligated to have prepared for it. Being unprepared for a foreseeable event leaves the defendant culpable. This standard is very strictly applied:
#* CE 9 April 1962, &quot;Chais d’Armagnac&quot;: The Council of State adjudged that, since a flood had occurred 69 years before the one that caused the damage at issue, the latter flood was predictable.
#* Administrative Court of Grenoble, 19 June 1974, &quot;Dame Bosvy&quot;: An avalanche was judged to be predictable since another had occurred around 50 years before.
# Irresistibility: The consequences of the event must have been unpreventable.

Other events that are candidates for force majeure in French law are hurricanes and earthquakes. Force majeure is a defense against liability and is applicable throughout French law. Force majeure and are distinct notions in French law.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, force majeure ( and ) is defined by the Civil Code of Argentina in Article 512, and regulated in Article 513. According to these articles, force majeure is defined by the following characteristics:
* an event that could not have been foreseen or if it could, an event that could not be resisted. From these, it can be said that some acts of nature can be predicted, but if their consequences cannot be resisted it can be considered force majeure.
* externality: the victim was not related directly or indirectly to the causes of the event, e.g., if the act was a fire, or a strike
* unpredictability: the event must had been originated after the cause of the obligation.
* irresistibility: the victim cannot by any means overcome the effects.

In Argentina, Act of God can be used in Civil Responsibility regarding contractual or noncontractual obligations.

==Hybrid law systems==
===Philippines===

As the oldest state with a size of over 300,000 sq km to integrate the two legal systems, the Philippines also has its own unique interpretation of force majeure events. Under the Civil Code in Article 1174,

Fortuitous events must not be caused by man but by nature. Therefore, economic crises are not considered as force majeure events that allows a debtor to be free of his obligation or debt. However such crises as an effect of wars such as World War II are considered as force majeure events as stated in &quot;Sagrada v. Nacoco&quot; (G.R. No. L-3756). The landmark case on this article and event is the case of &quot;Nakpil &amp; Sons v. CA&quot; (G.R. No. L-47851). In this case, the Philippine Bar Association (PBA) building was the only building destroyed on Arzobispo St., Intramuros, Manila during an earthquake in 1968. The PBA, through the Jose W. Diokno Law Office, led by Sen. Diokno himself, sued Nakpil &amp; Sons as well as the contractor of the building, United Construction Company, Inc., and won in the trial court. The case was merely reiterated and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Finally in 1986 the case was decided with finality by the Supreme Court. The Court mentioned the four requisites, by breaking down Article 1174. These are still the requisites used in Philippine courts today. These requisites are:
In doing so, the Supreme Court ruled that there is no fortuitous event, after also observing certain problems in construction such as measurement deficiencies and poor foundations.

==UNIDROIT Principles==

Article 7.1.7 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts provides for a form of force majeure similar, but not identical, to the common law and civil law concepts of the term: relief from performance is granted &quot;if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.&quot;

<text>The A6 is a route designation of a major metropolitan arterial route through suburban Sydney, linking Cumberland Highway at and Princes Highway at , via Lidcombe and Bankstown. This name covers a few consecutive roads and is widely known to most drivers, but the entire allocation is also known – and signposted – by the names of its constituent parts: Marsden Road, Stewart Street, Kissing Point Road, Silverwater Road, St Hilliers Road, Boorea Street, Olympic Drive, Joseph Street, Rookwood Road, Stacey Street, Fairford Road, Davies Road, Alfords Point Road, New Illawarra Road and [[Heathcote Road]].

==Route==
The A6 commences at the intersection of Cumberland Highway at Carlingford and heads in a southerly direction as Marsden Road as a two-lane, single carriageway road, before changing name to Stewart Street at Dundas Valley and heading west, widening to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road. It intersects with and changes name to Kissing Point Road, and then nearly immediately changing name again to Silverwater Road at Dundas and heads south, crossing over Victoria Road at an interchange in Ermington, crossing Parramatta River over Silverwater Bridge and widening to a six-lane, dual-carriageway just south of the river in Silverwater, meeting M4 Motorway at Auburn and then Great Western Highway shortly afterwards. It changes name to St Hilliers Road and continues southwest, then along Boorea Street heading east, then changes name again to Olympic Drive shortly afterwards and heads in a southerly direction to Lidcombe, changing name again to Joseph Street and Rookwood Road through Potts Hill, before changing name again to Stacey Street and narrowing to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road just before it meets Hume Highway at Chullora. It continues south, changing name to Fairford Road at Punchbowl, crossing over Canterbury Road at an interchange and then meeting M5 South Western Motorway shortly afterwards at Padstow, widening to a six-lane, dual-carriageway road. It changes name to Davies Road soon after, then again to Alfords Point Road at Padstow Heights, and crosses Georges River, narrowing to a four-lane, single-carriageway road at Alfords Point, and meets Old Illawarra Road at Menai, changing name to New Illawarra Road. It intersects with and changes name for the final time to Heathcote Road at Lucas Heights, before eventually terminating at the intersection with Princes Highway at Heathcote.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later the Department of Main Roads, and eventually Transport for NSW). Main Road no. 158 was declared from Kissing Point Road (today Victoria Road) in Ermington along Marsden Road to the intersection with Pennant Hills Road in Carlingford, and Main Road No. 190 was declared from the intersection with Great Western Highway in Lidcombe, via John Street, Church Street, Railway Parade, East Street, Victoria Street and Rookwood Road to the intersection with Hume Highway at Bankstown, on the same day, 8 August 1928; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these was amended to Main Roads 158 and 190 on 8 April 1929. Main Road 512 was declared along Heathcote Road on 15 November 1939, between Lucas Heights and Princes Highway at Heathcote (and continuing northwest to Hume Highway at Liverpool).

The Department of Main Roads constructed a number of defense routes during World War II, including Heathcote Road and a new road (called New Illawarra Road) between Lucas Heights and Heathcote Road, bypassing the causeway crossing of the Woronora River at The Needles; these projects were completed during 1941.

Main Road 532 was declared on 25 June 1947 along Sutherland Street, between its intersection with Great Western Highway at Auburn and the Parramatta River. Main Road 532A was declared on 4 May 1949 along Spurway Street, between Kissing Point Road in Dundas and Marsden Road in Dundas; this was replaced by Main Road 574 (and continuing west along Kissing Point Road to its intersection with Victoria Road in Parramatta) on 1 October 1951.

Spurway Street (part of Main Road 574) was later renamed Stewart Street, and Sutherland Street (Main Road 532) was later renamed Silverwater Road, on the same day, 6 August 1952; Main Road 512 was later renamed Heathcote Road (across its entire length between Liverpool and Heathcote), on 27 July 1955. 

The road project to bypass Lidcombe station to the west and connect to Bridge Street was completed in 1955 (with Main Road 190 deviating from John Street along Childs Street and the new Bridge Street alignment under the railway lines on 23 March 1955, and its southern end also extended along Chapel Road to meet Canterbury Road at Bankstown at the same time), with the route realigned again to reach Great Western Highway via Olympic Drive and St Hilliers Road instead on 2 May 1962. When the Silverwater Bridge over the Parramatta River was completed in 1962, the northern end of Main Road 532 was extended to cross the bridge to reach the intersection with Victoria Road in Ermington on 22 February 1967. A new bridge over the railway line east of Bankstown connecting both halves of Stacey Street was completed in 1970, and the completion of Alfords Point Bridge over the Georges River in 1973 extended the route further south from Padstow to Lucas Heights.

The route underwent further realignments: the Lidcombe bypass, connecting a new alignment from Victoria Street to Olympic Drive where it met at Bridge Street, opened in 1982. The northern end of Main Road 190 was extended northwards (from the intersection with Great Western Highway in Auburn along Silverwater Road via Ermington to the intersection with Kissing Point Road at Dundas - the last section still under construction at the time - subsuming Main Road 532) and re-aligned southwards (from Rookwood and Chapel Roads to Canterbury Road at Bankstown, to Rookwood Road via Hume Highway along Stacey Street and Fairford and Davies Roads to Henry Lawson Drive at Padstow Heights), on 15 February 1991, then extended south again along Alfords Point Road and New and Old Illawarra Roads to Heathcote Road at Lucas Heights, on 22 January 1993.

The Silverwater Road extension from Ermington to Dundas opened in 1996, allowing through traffic along Stewart Street and Marsden Road to Cumberland Highway in Carlingford. In 1999 Stacey Street was extended north to directly connect with Rookwood Road at Chullora, bypassing the dog-leg via Hume Highway between these two roads.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the A6 retains its declaration as Main Road 190 (from Dundas to Lucas Heights), and part of Main Roads 158 (Marsden Road), 512 (Heathcote Road), and 574 (Stewart Street and Kissing Point Road).

The route was allocated State Route 45 in 1974, from Victoria Road in to Princes Highway in , extended to Carlingford when the Silverwater extension opened in 1996. It was replaced in its entirely by Metroad 6 in January 1999. When Metroad 7 along Cumberland Highway was replaced by Westlink M7 on its opening in December 2005, Metroad 6 was extended northwards along Pennant Hills Road to the interchange with M2 Hills Motorway. Metroad 6 was realigned between Menai and Barden Ridge, from Old Illawarra Road onto New Illawarra Road, completed between 2005-11 as part of the Bangor Bypass project. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, Metroad 6 was replaced by route A6, with the previous extension along Pennant Hills Road truncated back to Carlingford.

==Future==
In 2019, the New South Wales Government announced it would rename the northern extension of the Princes Motorway, between Arncliffe and Kogarah (due to open in 2025) to the &quot;M6 Motorway&quot;. No announcement has yet been made on whether the A6 will be renumbered to avoid duplicate numbers.

<text>The M26 is a motorway in Kent, England. It is a short link between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near West Malling, which provides connectivity between southern England and the Channel ports in Kent.

==Route==
The motorway starts at junction 3 of the M20 and heads west, encountering almost immediately the single junction along its length where it has an interchange with the A20. This junction is numbered 2a to reflect its proximity to the M20&#x27;s nearby junction 2 (also connecting with the A20) a short distance to the north-west.

 to the west the M26 merges with the M25 at junction 5. There is no exit from the M26 at junction 5 and all traffic must join the clockwise (westbound) M25. The next M25 junction, number 6, is west at Godstone so traffic joining the M26 at Junction 2a cannot leave the motorway for , the longest distance between motorway exits in the UK.

On the anti-clockwise direction of the M25, the main carriageway continues directly onto the M26 at junction 5. To remain on the M25, traffic must turn on to the slip road which connects to the M25 spur coming north from Sevenoaks, which is multiplexed with the A21. The awkwardness of junction 5 is a result of the history of the two motorways&#x27; planning and construction.

==History==
Construction of the first part of the M25 began in 1972 but before it opened, plans for the &quot;London Orbital&quot; motorway were modified to combine the southern and western part of Ringway 4 with the northern and eastern part of Ringway 3. To connect the two separate routes, which together were numbered as the M25, an additional section of road needed to be planned and the M25 route was diverted northwards from junction 5 to meet Ringway 3 at Swanley (M25 junction 3).

The remaining section of Ringway 4 became the M26. Until February 1986, the anticlockwise M25 simply became the M26 at Junction 5, as the M25 between Junction 5 and Junction 3 was not opened until then.

A few hundred metres of the eastern end is the former A20(M).

===Construction===
Construction of the M26 began in October 1977, although a route on a similar alignment was originally proposed in the Greater London Plan in 1944 as part of proposed post war improvements to London area transport network. Those proposals were developed further in the 1960s as part of the London Ringways plan and the route of the M26 at that time formed part of Ringway 4 and would have been designated as part of the M25. Construction was slowed down by three wet summers and Gault clay.

It was built by Cementation Ltd, with chief engineer was Ian Watts. It cost £18m. There were 300 people on the project; John Oldham was project manager for the Dunton Green to Wrotham section. There was good weather in 1979. The nearby M20, the West Kingsdown to Addington section, was being built at the same time, by Dowsett. But it would be many years before the nearby M25 was built.

===Opening===
It was opened on Tuesday 18 November 1980 at 11am at Wrotham by Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler and Mark Wolfson.

==Proposed developments==
===New junction===
Kent County Council has been in talks with the Highways Agency over a possible new junction with the A225, allowing direct access to Sevenoaks – or access to the A21 at the M25 junction.

===Brexit contingency planning===
Plans to modify the M26 to hold large numbers of lorries in the event of a no-deal Brexit were publicly revealed in October 2018.

<doc id="709136" wikidata="Q15277461" url="?curid=709136" title="Shrine of Our Lady, Bradstowe">
<text>The Shrine of Our Ladye Star of the Sea was an old chapel on the cliffs at Broadstairs (which was formerly known as Bradstowe). Dating back at least to the 1350s, the two towers of the chapel were a major landmark for sailors in the area. Given the veneration in which the shrine was held, the custom developed of ships dipping their top-sails to salute the shrine as they sailed past it.

The Chapel of St. Mary&#x27;s structural remains are, as incorporated in the modern facade, situated on the site of what has been said also to be the oldest surviving building still standing in contemporary Broadstairs, and within its modern content is all that remains of the Medieval Shrine of &quot;Our Lady of Bradstowe&quot;. It stands near the harbour on today&#x27;s Albion Street, at the junction with Alexandra Road.

==History==
It is said that the Shrine and its Chapel were known to have existed prior to the year 1070, as it was in that year that the old Saxon Church of St. Peter&#x27;s, then a wooden structure, was rebuilt with stone and flint as the second daughter church of Minster-in-Thanet.

The original building contained the famous shrine of &quot;Our Ladye of Bradstowe&quot;, a painted wooden statue of the Virgin Mary. The tradition maintained by the Royal Navy of &quot;showing the flag&quot; at seaside towns to uphold the morale of the Navy is said to have its origins in a service held at the Bradstowe Chapel in 1514 with the crew of the &quot;Henry Grace a Dieu&quot; in attendance, whilst the largest and latest addition to the King&#x27;s Fleet was moored nearby. There was also a wooden cross at the top of the cliff. Chapel Stairs in Albion Street marks where steps cut into the chalk used to go down to the harbor.

Up until about 1514, when Trinity House took over such duties, it was traditional for coastal towns and village&#x27;s to display some kind of beacon on the high points of their coastline as a warning against the locally known potential hazards to shipping. Thus in medieval times the Chapel of St. Mary was known as &quot;The Chapel of Blue Light&quot;, for its light was given out into the dark seas through a blue glass lantern. 

===Culmer chapel===
During the 1520s a severe storm that lasted several days swept into Viking Bay with a storm surge and destroyed the Shrine, badly damaging the Chapel. Shipwright George Culmer rebuilt the Chapel and replaced the Shrine.

In 1601 the owner of the Chapel and the estate upon which it stood was Sir John Culmer, one of the first Congregationalist pioneers. It was he who had ordered the Chapel (and its Shrine) restored. Restoration in those dark times paid little heed to the integrity of the existing structure, consequently, and although much of the original material was reused in the restoration, the new Chapel was said not to be so picturesque as the original. Some of the original ancient wall, a doorway and window have survived in the renovated structure. The Shrine of the Culmer Chapel, a statue derived from the figure of the Virgin Mary, mounted on a tall column, was so positioned that it faced seaward.

The first Pastor in 1601 was Joel Culmer. It had been for some years even then the tradition of ships passing at Thanet to lower their top sail in salutation to the Shrine and Chapel, which was thought to bring a good fate to the passage of the ship.

The Shrine was at some stage, probably 1601, placed inside the Chapel, for thereafter local seamen came to refer to it as &quot;The Weeping Virgin&quot;. Hot weather is said to have caused humidity and thus condensation in the Chapel which settled on the face of the Shrine, and caused the figure to appear in the countenance of the Virgin, weeping. This effect was considered by religious mariners to be a bad omen as a storm would often follow, atmospheric changes indicated in the Chapel were thus a good rough guide to those who would face the perils of the sea.

The Chapel was again rebuilt in 1825. In the 1830s it hosted a Baptist congregation. In 1871 the Congregationalists built a new place of worship and the front part of the old chapel housed a blacksmith and a greengrocer. In 1924 the Plymouth Brethren had use of the building. In 1926 it became a parish room for the Anglican Holy Trinity Church. The building has since been used as a bookstore and pub.

==Legacy==
The shrine of Our Lady of Bradstowe now resides in Holy Trinity church Broadstairs, not far from the original chapel.
The shrine gives its name to the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea which is inland at 17 Broadstairs Road in St Peter&#x27;s. This was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott in 1930.

<doc id="709137" wikidata="Q407693" url="?curid=709137" title="Cytochrome P450">
<text>Cytochromes P450 (P450s or CYPs) are a superfamily of enzymes containing heme as a cofactor that mostly, but not exclusively, function as monooxygenases. However, they are not omnipresent; for example, they have not been found in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. In mammals, these enzymes oxidize steroids, fatty acids, xenobiotics, and participate in many biosyntheses. By hydroxylation, CYP450 enzymes convert xenobiotics into hydrophilic derivatives, which are more readily excreted.

P450s are, in general, the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized as P450-containing systems. The term &quot;P450&quot; is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with carbon monoxide. Most P450s require a protein partner to deliver one or more electrons to reduce the iron (and eventually molecular oxygen).

==Nomenclature==
Genes encoding P450 enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, are designated with the root symbol CYP for the superfamily, followed by a number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene. The convention is to &quot;italicize&quot; the name when referring to the gene. For example, &quot;CYP2E1&quot; is the gene that encodes the enzyme CYP2E1—one of the enzymes involved in paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism. The CYP nomenclature is the official naming convention, although occasionally CYP450 or CYP450 is used synonymously. These names should never be used as according to the nomenclature convention (as they denote a P450 in family number 450). However, some gene or enzyme names for P450s are also referred to by historical names (e.g. P450BM3 for CYP102A1) or functional names, denoting the catalytic activity and the name of the compound used as substrate. Examples include CYP5A1, thromboxane A2 synthase, abbreviated to TBXAS1 (ThromBoXane A2 Synthase 1), and CYP51A1, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase, sometimes unofficially abbreviated to LDM according to its substrate (Lanosterol) and activity (DeMethylation).

The current nomenclature guidelines suggest that members of new CYP families share at least 40% amino-acid identity, while members of subfamilies must share at least 55% amino-acid identity. Nomenclature committees assign and track both base gene names (Cytochrome P450 Homepage ) and allele names (CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee).

== Classification ==

Based on the nature of the electron transfer proteins, P450s can be classified into several groups:

;Microsomal P450 systems: in which electrons are transferred from NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (variously CPR, POR, or CYPOR). Cytochrome b5 (cyb5) can also contribute reducing power to this system after being reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R).
;Mitochondrial P450 systems: which employ adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin to transfer electrons from NADPH to P450.
;Bacterial P450 systems: which employ a ferredoxin reductase and a ferredoxin to transfer electrons to P450.
;CYB5R/cyb5/P450 systems: in which both electrons required by the CYP come from cytochrome b5.
;FMN/Fd/P450 systems: originally found in &quot;Rhodococcus&quot; species, in which a FMN-domain-containing reductase is fused to the CYP.
;P450 only systems: which do not require external reducing power. Notable ones include thromboxane synthase (CYP5), prostacyclin synthase (CYP8), and CYP74A (allene oxide synthase).

The most common reaction catalyzed by cytochromes P450 is a monooxygenase reaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into the aliphatic position of an organic substrate (RH), while the other oxygen atom is reduced to water:

==Related hydroxylation enzymes==
Many hydroxylation reactions (insertion of hydroxyl groups) use CYP enzymes, but many other hydroxylases exist. Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases also rely on an Fe=O intermediate but lack hemes. Methane monooxygenase, which converts methane to methanol, are non-heme iron-and iron-copper-based enzymes.

==Mechanism==
=== Structure ===
The active site of cytochrome P450 contains a heme-iron center. The iron is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. This cysteine and several flanking residues are highly conserved in known P450s, and have the formal PROSITE signature consensus pattern [FW] - [SGNH] - x - [GD] - {F} - [RKHPT] - {P} - C - [LIVMFAP] - [GAD]. In general, the P450 catalytic cycle proceeds as follows:

===Catalytic cycle===
# Substrate binds in proximity to the heme group, on the side opposite to the axial thiolate. Substrate binding induces a change in the conformation of the active site, often displacing a water molecule from the distal axial coordination position of the heme iron, and changing the state of the heme iron from low-spin to high-spin.
# Substrate binding induces electron transfer from NAD(P)H via cytochrome P450 reductase or another associated reductase, converting Fe(III) to Fe(II).
# Molecular oxygen binds to the resulting ferrous heme center at the distal axial coordination position, initially giving a dioxygen adduct similar to oxy-myoglobin.
# A second electron is transferred, from either cytochrome P450 reductase, ferredoxins, or cytochrome b5, reducing the Fe-O2 adduct to give a short-lived peroxo state.
# The peroxo group formed in step 4 is rapidly protonated twice, releasing one molecule of water and forming the highly reactive species referred to as P450 Compound 1 (or just Compound I). This highly reactive intermediate was isolated in 2010, P450 Compound 1 is an iron(IV) oxo (or ferryl) species with an additional oxidizing equivalent delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. Evidence for the alternative perferryl iron(V)-oxo is lacking.
# Depending on the substrate and enzyme involved, P450 enzymes can catalyze any of a wide variety of reactions. A hypothetical hydroxylation is illustrated. After the hydroxylated product has been released from the active site, the enzyme returns to its original state, with a water molecule returning to occupy the distal coordination position of the iron nucleus.
# An alternative route for mono-oxygenation is via the &quot;peroxide shunt&quot; (path &quot;S&quot; in figure). This pathway entails oxidation of the ferric-substrate complex with oxygen-atom donors such as peroxides and hypochlorites. A hypothetical peroxide &quot;XOOH&quot; is shown in the diagram.
Mechanistic details, including the oxygen rebound mechanism, have been investigated with synthetic analogues, consisting of iron oxo heme complexes.

===Spectroscopy===
Binding of substrate is reflected in the spectral properties of the enzyme, with an increase in absorbance at 390 nm and a decrease at 420 nm. This can be measured by difference spectroscopies and is referred to as the &quot;type I&quot; difference spectrum (see inset graph in figure). Some substrates cause an opposite change in spectral properties, a &quot;reverse type I&quot; spectrum, by processes that are as yet unclear. Inhibitors and certain substrates that bind directly to the heme iron give rise to the type II difference spectrum, with a maximum at 430 nm and a minimum at 390 nm (see inset graph in figure). If no reducing equivalents are available, this complex may remain stable, allowing the degree of binding to be determined from absorbance measurements &quot;in vitro&quot;
C: If carbon monoxide (CO) binds to reduced P450, the catalytic cycle is interrupted. This reaction yields the classic CO difference spectrum with a maximum at 450 nm. However, the interruptive and inhibitory effects of CO varies upon different CYPs such that the CYP3A family is relatively less affected.

===Binding site===
The heme in cytochrome P450 binds to a conserved sequence: phe – X – X – gly – arg – X – cys – X – gly, where &quot;X&quot; denotes some variant amino acid. The cysteine binds Fe and arginine, forming strong electrostatic interactions with negatively charged side chains of the heme. The glycine residues within the conserved sequence are essential, as their small structure enables surrounding alpha helices to remain in place without interacting with a variant amino acid.

<text>The A4, A44 and M4 are a collection of arterial routes in Sydney, New South Wales that connect the Inner West of Sydney with the outer western suburbs.

The A4 and M4 mostly follows what was previously National Route 32 from the Western Distributor in the CBD, west to the Great Western Highway at Lapstone. Both the A4 and M4 sections were known as Metroad 4 until 2013, which in turn replaced the previous Sydney stretch of National Route 32 in September 1992 while the A44 was known as State Route 44 until 2013.

Between 2019 and 2023, the progressive opening of WestConnex resulted in route allocation of M4 along newly opened sections, and former bypassed sections of A4 redesignated as A44. The last route redesignation was in November 2023 with the opening of Rozelle Interchange, the last component of the WestConnex.

The names &quot;M4&quot;, &quot;A44&quot; and &quot;A4&quot; are just the route allocations for the route as a whole. In fact, the M4 route runs along a whole series of motorways with the A44 running parallel along non-motorway roads until they converge west of Anzac Bridge. East of here is the Western Distributor, the only section of the A4 route, even though the Western Distributor is also a controlled-access highway (i.e. like a motorway but with lower speed limits).

The roads from east to west are:
* A4 section:
** Western Distributor
* A44 section:
** Victoria Road
** The Crescent
** City West Link
** Dobroyd Parade
** Wattle Street
** Great Western Highway/Parramatta Road (West of Wattle Street Intersection)
* M4 section:
** M4 East
** Western Motorway

==History==

The earliest route allocation of M4/A4 is National Route 32. It was introduced in 1954 with other National Routes. Most of the 1954 alignment of National Route 32 in Sydney is very different from the current M4/A4 alignment in Sydney. Back then National Route 32 ran along the entire Great Western Highway from via the Blue Mountains to Broadway, Sydney.

With the opening of the M4 Motorway in 1992, National Route 32 was truncated and terminated at Lapstone in Blue Mountains instead. Metroad 4 was introduced to replace the Sydney section of National Route 32, but went along the motorway instead of Great Western Highway from Lapstone to North Strathfield. This was the first Metroad to be introduced in Sydney. The section of Great Western Highway that was formerly National Route 32 was allocated State Route 44 which is now A44.

In 2000, when the City West Link opened, Metroad 4 was realigned to Wattle Street, Dobroyd Parade, City West Link, Victoria Road and Western Distributor and terminated at the junction of Cahill Expressway, Western Distributor and Bradfield Highway in Millers Point.

In 2013, as part of the state-wide alpha numeric route conversion, the Metroad 4 was replaced by M4 for the motorway and A4 for the non-motorway section.

In July 2019, the A4 between Strathfield and Haberfield was realigned onto the new M4 East tunnels and was redesignated M4. This meant that A4 no longer runs along any section of Parramatta Road or Great Western Highway.

In January 2023, the M4 route was extended along the newly open M4–M8 tunnels, but temporarily transitioned into the M8 route at . The previous A4 on City West Link was also redesignated A44. This resulted in a discontinuity between the M4 and A4 routes for ten months, until the opening of the Rozelle Interchange in November 2023 which extended the M4 route along newly opened tunnels to meet with the A4 just west of Anzac Bridge.

<doc id="709141" wikidata="Q1408430" url="?curid=709141" title="Gilberto Concepción de Gracia">
<text>Dr. Gilberto Concepción de Gracia (July 9, 1909 – March 16, 1968) was a lawyer, journalist, author, politician, former senator and founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. He is the great uncle of maternal siblings Residente and ILE of Calle 13, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

==Early years==
Concepción de Gracia was born in the town of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico to Ceferino Concepción Álvarez and Carmen de Gracia Toro. There he attended José de Diego elementary school in his hometown of Vega Alta and &quot;Central High School&quot; in Santurce, a district of San Juan, Puerto Rico. After he graduated from high school, he continued his academic education studies and earned a bachelors and later master&#x27;s degree in Law and Public Administration from the University of Puerto Rico. He earned a doctorate in Law from George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C.

==Career as a lawyer==
Concepción de Gracia worked as a lawyer specializing in civil and constitutional law. In 1936, at the age of 25, he moved to New York to represent Pedro Albizu Campos and other members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, who were jailed and appealing their case.

Concepción de Gracia remained in New York, defending the civil rights of Hispanic workers and other minorities. He became more involved in politics, and particularly the cause of Puerto Rican independence from the United States. He befriended the like-minded congressman Vito Marcantonio, and took the editorship of a newspaper called &quot;La Voz&quot; (&quot;The Voice&quot;).

==Educator==
Concepción de Gracia later became a professor of Hispanic literature at Middlebury College in Vermont. He then moved to Washington, D.C., and worked at the Panamerican Union, the organization which would later be known as the Organization of American States. In 1943, while he continued to pursue his Law education, Concepcion de Gracia joined a group called the &#x27;Congress for Independence&#x27;, which advocated the independence of Puerto Rico.

==Puerto Rican Independence Party==

On October 20, 1946, the Puerto Rican Independence Party (&quot;Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño&quot;, or &quot;PIP&quot;) was created with Concepción de Gracia as its president. The PIP was registered as an official political party in 1948 and participated in that year&#x27;s elections. It became the second-largest party in Puerto Rico in 1952, when it captured 20% of the electoral vote. Fifteen (15) PIP members were elected to the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico that year. Concepcion de Gracia himself joined the Senate of Puerto Rico, and became the speaker for his party, a post which he held until 1960.

That year, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) won the governorship and created a political status known as the Associated Free State (&quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot;, or &quot;ELA&quot;). Concepcion de Gracia claimed that the new status was only a deceptive way to hide and continue the colonial relationship with the U.S.

On July 25, 1952, Puerto Rico adopted a constitution establishing its status as a commonwealth. Concepción de Gracia and the PIP considered this status to be just another name for colonialism, and did not participate in the Constitutional Assembly.

==Puerto Rico before the United Nations==

Concepción de Gracia and Julio Pinto Gandía took Puerto Rico&#x27;s case before the United Nations and sustained that Puerto Ricans should have the right to a consultation before being sent to any war. He also protested the sterilization practices in the U.S. of Puerto Ricans and the passive immigration of Puerto Ricans to the U.S.

In 1955 he represented Puerto Rico in a conference held in Bandung, Indonesia sponsored by the United Nations. He also represented the PIP at the 1949 conference of the Organization of American States held in Havana, Cuba, and at the 1957 conference in Maracay, Venezuela. In 1964 he represented the PIP at a United States Congress commission on Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status. Gilberto Concepción de Gracia died on March 15, 1968, in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was buried at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==In memory==
Concepción de Gracia&#x27;s name has been attached to many places in Puerto Rico, including the beach on the contested island of Vieques where the PIP established a camp in 1999 during the Navy-Vieques protests. His native town of Vega Alta erected a statue in his honor in the town&#x27;s square.

<text>Spike Breakwell (born Colin James Breakwell on 13 June 1968) is a British comedian. When he was four months old he became disabled through taking oral polio vaccine which caused a two-week coma. He was brought up in Dunstable, and &quot;treated and raised to be as stubborn and independent as anyone else round about.&quot; As a child, he attended Lady Zia Wernher School in Luton, then moved to Lord Mayor Treloar College in Alton, Hampshire for his secondary education.

Breakwell was the first wheelchair-using comedian on the London alternative club circuit from 1992, appearing on stage and BBC2 television. His act always started with the line: &quot;...I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been drinking but I could walk half an hour ago!&quot;. He also co-wrote and co-starred (with Simon Hardeman) in the Edinburgh International Festival Fringe shows &quot;On The Toilet With Shergar (An Evening of Horseplay and Lavatory Humour )&quot; in 1992, &quot;Simon and Spikes Laugh-In&quot; in 1993 and the critically acclaimed play looking at comedy &quot;Death of a Comedian&quot; in 1994.

He co-wrote (with Simon Hardeman) the &quot;Beginners&#x27; Guide&quot; column in The Times Magazine. He has also been a regular in a BBC disability magazine programme. In January 2006 Breakwell and part of the &quot;Wheelabout&quot; expedition team drove across Australia. He had planned to become the first person to cross from Perth to Sydney (4600 miles) in an electric wheelchair. However, funding for the trip failed to materialise and it is yet to be completed.

In October 2007 he appeared in his first Hollywood film, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Criterion&quot;, described as a supernatural horror story of a possessed television, as &quot;Ziggy Fontain&quot; a wheelchair-using TV advertising producer.

<text>Ariadne (named for the figure from Greek mythology) is a European association for sharing knowledge and fostering international cooperation in teaching that is open to the world.

Ariadne was initiated in 1996 by the European Commission&#x27;s telematics for education and training program. Since then, an infrastructure has been developed in Belgium and Switzerland for the production of reusable learning content, including distributed storage and discovery, as well as its exploitation in structured courses. The core of this infrastructure is a distributed library of digital, reusable educational components called the &quot;Knowledge Pool System&quot; (KPS) now actively used in both academic and corporate contexts.

End users interact with the KPS through client tools. Java and web applications allow users to insert documents and their associated metadata into the KPS, search for relevant documents, and download them from the KPS. Java applications interact with the KPS through the &quot;ARIADNE Web Services&quot;. The ARIADNE Web Services provide an API that hides the database access details and also enables interoperability with other repositories. 

The ARIADNE toolset contains the following components:
*The ARIADNE KPS Client 
*SILO, the current Indexation- and Query tool for learning objects
*AMG, a component that leverages existing libraries for automatic metadata generation
*A LOM based Federated search engine, that dynamically searches other (more learning technology oriented) search systems like Lionshare, Merlot, Edna, NIME, etc.

<doc id="709146" wikidata="Q7834373" url="?curid=709146" title="Transit of Venus (play)">
<text>Transit of Venus is a play by Canadian playwright Maureen Hunter. It was first produced at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in November 1992.

The play is based on the life of Guillaume Le Gentil (1725–1792), a gentleman astronomer.
In the play, he is obsessed with observing the transit of Venus. He leaves Celeste, the girl who loves him, to embark on an expedition to observe it. He returns after six years, having failed to observe the transit. He immediately makes preparations for a new expedition to observe the next transit.

Some artistic license was taken: the real-life Guillaume Le Gentil did not return until after the second transit, remaining overseas during the eight-year interim.

The play was subsequently performed across Canada, by the Royal Shakespeare Company and the BBC.

==Opera version==
The play was transformed into an opera of the same name with libretto by Maureen Hunter and music by Victor Davies. This was presented by Manitoba Opera on November 24, 2007.

<doc id="709150" wikidata="Q2448715" url="?curid=709150" title="M55 motorway">
<text>The M55 is a motorway in Lancashire, England, which can also be referred to as the Preston Northern Bypass. It connects the seaside resort of Blackpool to the M6 at Preston. It is 12.2 miles (19.6 km) in length.

 was originally built in 1958 as part of the UK&#x27;s first motorway, the Preston Bypass, and the remainder was built in 1975.

==Route==
The M55 has three lanes in both directions for most of its length. After leaving the M6 at junction 32, the road immediately interchanges with the A6 and then crosses the West Coast Main Line. It meets the A582 extension, built in 2023, at junction 2, then crosses the Lancaster Canal before passing north of Wesham to meet the A585 at junction 3. It then continues west in a rural setting to meet A583 at junction 4, where the motorway ends and becomes the A5230. The western part of the M55, and the first few hundred metres of the A5230, occupy the route of the old Blackpool Branch railway line.

==History==

*The section from the M6 to junction 1 opened as part of the M6 Preston By-pass in 1958.
*The section between junctions 1 and 4 opened in 1975.

The first motorway constructed in Great Britain was the M6 Preston Bypass, opened in 1958. This ran from the current M6 junction 29 to the M55 junction 1. It was built as a two-lane route. In 1965 the M6 was extended north from what is the current day junction 32 to meet the Lancaster Bypass, and the M6 junction was rebuilt to its current design to connect the A6 at the now M55 junction 1. Due to increasing traffic, it was decided to provide a motorway link to Blackpool and this road was opened in 1975.

Some of the material for backfilling the new M55 was obtained from a nearby disused airfield at RNAS Inskip, where the runways were broken up and the land returned to agriculture. More material came from the Tootle Heights quarries in Longridge.

===Junction 2===
Until 2023, the motorway had no junction 2. A proposed South Ribble link road would have involved the extension of the M65 motorway around the west of Preston to link to the M55 at the missing junction. The link road proposal has been dormant since the mid-1990s. Between 1993 and 1995, the M6 around the east of Preston was widened to four lanes, making the link road proposal less likely.

As part of a City Deal signed between Preston City Council and central Government in late 2013, both Lancashire County Council and Preston City Council agreed in principle to build a &#x27;Preston Western Distributor Road&#x27; which would link the A583/A584 outside Clifton to a new junction 2 of the M55.

Construction of the new road began in September 2019 and involved a new motorway junction, four new bridges and two viaducts. The £200million scheme was completed in July 2023 and was named Edith Rigby Way. Moto Hospitality submitted plans to Preston City Council in December 2024 to build a services station off junction 2.

==Incidents==
===Aircraft test landing===
In April 1975, during work to extend the motorway, a test was conducted, by test pilot Tim Ferguson, using a Jaguar military jet aircraft from nearby Warton Aerodrome to prove the viability of using the road as a makeshift runway in time of war. The demonstration was not publicised, in the interests of public safety, but many spectators crossed the fields and gathered on the banks at the side of the motorway to watch.

==Junctions==

The entire route is in the ceremonial county of Lancashire.

<doc id="709158" wikidata="Q5363488" url="?curid=709158" title="Speedbird">
<text>The Speedbird is the stylised emblem of a bird in flight designed in 1932 by Theyre Lee-Elliott as the corporate logo for Imperial Airways. It became a design classic and was used by the airline and its successors – British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British Airways – for 52 years. The term &quot;Speedbird&quot; is still the call sign for British Airways.

==History==

===Imperial Airways===

The original Speedbird was designed in 1932 for Imperial Airways by Theyre Lee-Elliott through Stuart Advertising Agency. A relief sculpture, which become the final version, was made by Barbara Hepworth. It was initially used on advertising posters and luggage labels. Later, it was applied to the nose section of the company&#x27;s aircraft and could be seen for example in 1938 on the company&#x27;s Short Empire S.30 flying boats.

===BOAC===

With the creation of BOAC in 1939 the logo was retained, continuing to appear on the noses of aircraft throughout World War II despite the military-style camouflage that had replaced the airline livery.

From 1950 BOAC gave the Speedbird greater prominence on the aircraft using it on the tail fin, either in navy blue on a white background or vice versa, and also using it widely elsewhere, such as on airport buses.

With the advent of air traffic control and the adoption of call signs to identify aircraft and their operators, BOAC chose the name of their now well-known logo, &quot;Speedbird&quot;, as their call sign when in flight.

In the mid-1960s the design of the Speedbird was slightly altered, with a slimmer &quot;body&quot; and larger &quot;wing&quot;, and on the tailfin coloured gold on a navy blue background. Elsewhere the colours used for it were mostly a combination of cyan and white.

===British Airways===

In 1974, BOAC was merged with British European Airways and others to form British Airways. The speedbird logo was retained unaltered, but returned to the nose section of the aircraft. A prominent Union Flag design now occupied the fin.

The Speedbird survived for another ten years, finally being retired in December 1984. It was replaced by the Speedwing, which was itself replaced by the current Speedmarque in 1997.
As British Airways prepared for privatisation, a new corporate look was adopted in 1984, developed by Landor Associates. Referred to as the Speedwing, the red flash on the lower dark blue part of the fuselage bore a slight resemblance to the original 1930s design. The current Speedmarque ribbon bears a tangential resemblance to the original Speedbird.
&quot;Speedbird&quot; continues to be used by British Airways as the ICAO callsign for its main international services. On its domestic services, it uses the callsign &quot;Shuttle&quot;.

Hatton Cross tube station, which opened in 1975, still has the Speedbird decorating its platform pillars.

In 2019, the Speedbird emblem returned to use by British Airways with the unveiling of their BOAC-liveried Boeing 747-400 to celebrate 100 years of BA and its predecessors.

==Design significance==

Theyre Lee-Elliott was a graphic artist and painter working in London in the 1930s.

The Speedbird is among his best known works. The minimalist, stylish and avant-garde design representing a bird in flight it is instantly recognisable and has a timelessly modern appeal.

Lee-Elliott was influenced by Vorticism, particularly the work of Edward McKnight Kauffer. The logo echoes Kauffer&#x27;s angular bird forms in his 1918 poster for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

Other notable works by Lee-Elliott include posters for the London Underground and the Airmail logo. Many of his paintings and original artworks are in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==Other Speedbirds==
A somewhat different Speedbird logo was designed for Piedmont Airlines in 1948.

Speedbird House was an office block at Heathrow Airport. It was originally the headquarters of BOAC and, until the company moved, of British Airways.

Speedbird Way is a road near the Colnbrook Bypass, close to Heathrow Airport.

Speedbird is also the name of one of the British Airways Sailing Club yachts.

<text>The M57 motorway, also known as the Liverpool Outer Ring Road, is a motorway in England. Designed as a ring road for Liverpool, it is long between Tarbock Green and Switch lsland, and links various towns east of the city, as well as the M62 and M58 motorways.

==Route==
Starting at the Tarbock Interchange in Tarbock, at the end of the A5300, the motorway heads north to the east of Huyton and west of Prescot and crosses the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It then runs across the northeast of Huyton before running west of Knowsley Village. After meeting the A580 at a split junction (numbered 4 &amp; 5), it continues northwest through Kirkby, passes under the Kirkby and Ormskirk branches of the Merseyrail Northern Line before ending on Switch Island near Aintree. The motorway provides one of the main access routes to Aintree Racecourse.

==History==
The M57 was planned to be a complete bypass of Liverpool, meeting some of the key routes out of the city. As is normal in the United Kingdom, the M57 was to be built in stages. The first two opened were:
*Junctions 4 to 7 were opened in 1972 as phase 1.
*Junctions 1 to 4 were opened in 1974 as phase 2.

Phase 1 was approved by Lancashire County Council&#x27;s highways and bridges committee in April 1969, estimating to cost around £3.9million with construction work anticipated to start several months later. By the end of 1969, work had not yet commenced, although the Minister of Transport Fred Mulley announced in December 1969 that a grant of around £2.9million had been made to Lancashire County Council towards the road&#x27;s cost. Following conclusion of an invitation to tender process in January 1970, construction work was expected to start around March 1970. The road was planned with dual wide carriageways and a wide central reservation which allowed for future carriageway widening. The scheme was proceeded with more rapidly as there had been industrial growth in the area, and it was considered important to improve traffic connections as soon as possible. The original plans for the route anticipated an extension south to the A562.

The road opened to traffic in April 1972, three months ahead of schedule. Shortly before opening, the second phase was announced by the council as being close to starting construction, with an estimated cost of £11.5million.

At Switch Island, the junction was constructed to allow an extension of the M57 towards the A565 near Thornton and the end of the M58 has provision for slip roads to that extension to be constructed. Contemporary maps also showed a proposed southern extension, eventually constructed in the 1990s as the A5300. A new road was opened in August 2015 to join the A565 at Thornton to Switch Island junction at the M57 and M58 motorways respectively; the road was appropriately named the A5758 road.

At the southern end of the M57 where it meets the M62 (Tarbock Island) and also the A5300 southern extension, a £38million improvement scheme to create a free-flow link with the M62 eastbound was completed on 14 November 2008. At the same junction a free-flow link from the M62 Westbound to the M57 northbound was completed on 12 December.

<text>The M58 is a motorway passing through Merseyside and Lancashire, terminating in Greater Manchester. It is 12 miles (19.3 km) long and provides a link between the M6 motorway and the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton and hence on, via the A5036, to the Mersey docks in Liverpool and Birkenhead.

==Route==
Apart from the approaches to its terminal roundabouts, the motorway is three lanes throughout. It starts at Switch Island in Merseyside and passes directly underneath the Merseyrail Northern Line. before striking out across open countryside and into Lancashire south of Maghull and Bickerstaffe. It then curves south Easterly south of Skelmersdale before reaching the M6 at Orrell in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, Greater Manchester.

==History==
Since 1949 an upgrade of the Wigan to Ormskirk route had been proposed to improve traffic flows, yet with the decision in 1961 to develop Skelmersdale as a new town, the proposals were revised to provide a link to the M6 at one end and Liverpool at the other.

The first part of the road was opened in March 1968 as the &quot;Skelmersdale Regional Road&quot; between what is now junctions 4 and 5. It was originally a two-lane single carriageway road that was upgraded to two-lane plus with hard shoulders in 1973.

The next stage was to connect this road to the M6 and construction on this part began in 1968 and it was opened to traffic in October 1970 as all purpose dual carriageway. Now junctions 5 to 6, this road was upgraded to dual three lanes with a hard shoulder in 1977. These roads were upgraded to motorway status in 1977.

Construction on Switch Island to junction 4 section began in 1978 with the road opening between April and September 1980.

===Unfulfilled plans===
Junction 2 was not built, and was the end of a proposed motorway to Preston. This was originally given the designation A59(M) as an upgrade to the A59 and later referred to as the M59. However these proposals were dropped in favour of improvements to the existing A59.

At Switch Island, the junction has been built to allow an extension of the M57 and the end of M58 has provision for slip roads to the extension to be constructed.

Lancashire County Council had in 1949 also proposed a Wigan to Bolton road. Bridges had been built on the M61 to allow for this eventual continuation. Later plans saw the road downgraded to an A road; it would have reached the M61 between junctions 5 and 6. These plans have also been dropped and currently Wigan Borough Council has plans for a part dual and part single carriageway route to the A579 near Atherton.

<doc id="709178" wikidata="Q263257" url="?curid=709178" title="Construction Time Again">
<text>Construction Time Again is the third studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 22 August 1983 by Mute Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Alan Wilder as a member, who wrote the songs &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot; and &quot;The Landscape Is Changing&quot;. The album&#x27;s title comes from the second line of the first verse of the track &quot;Pipeline&quot;. It was recorded at John Foxx&#x27;s The Garden studios in London, and was supported by the Construction Time Again Tour.

The album was preceded by the single &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, released on 11 July and reached No. 6 on the UK Charts and was also promoted by the single &quot;Love, in Itself&quot;, which was released on 19 September and reached No. 21 on the UK Charts.

==Background and themes==

In January 1983, shortly before the release of the &quot;Get the Balance Right!&quot; single, songwriter Martin Gore attended an Einstürzende Neubauten concert, giving him the idea to experiment with the sounds of industrial music in the context of pop.
This album introduced a transition in lyrical content for the group. &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; would include a bevy of political themes, sparked by the poverty Gore had seen on a then-recent trip he had taken to Thailand.

Producer Daniel Miller, has explained the recording process as &quot;a massive leap forward&quot;. Due to the band, as well as Miller, having an urge to change up their processes they decided to change which studio they would work in, which was decided to be John Foxx&#x27;s Garden Studios in London, and they also met Gareth Jones, who had worked with Foxx on his album &quot;Metamatic&quot; (1980). Initially, Jones was reluctant to work with the group as he felt they were too commercial and viewed them as &#x27;pop&#x27; and &#x27;lightweight&#x27;, which he saw as an issue. However, Foxx had persuaded Jones to work with the band as he felt that due to his appreciation for Mute Records&#x27; musical output, such as Miller&#x27;s &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; the band would be worth while as Miller was their producer and they were a Mute label artist. Jones would provide contributions to further albums such as &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; (1984) and &quot;Black Celebration&quot; (1986).

With regards to the heavy amount of sampling, the band would sample various &#x27;found&#x27; sounds, such as toy instruments or other objects like stones and objects found in construction sites which they would manipulate using the Synclavier. Band member Alan Wilder said, &quot;You can take the purest voice in the world, and fool around with it digitally until it&#x27;s the most evil, monstrous sound. Or you can take a moose fart and make it beautiful.&quot; Miller recalled &quot;Martin [Gore] would turn up with some toy or some other weird instrument and we just started recording it, sampling it, doing shit with it.&quot; He looked back on the recording process as one of the most enjoyable he has been through stating &quot;I sit at home with my synthesizers making great noises, but when you can put those experiments into the pop form that&#x27;s thrilling.&quot;

==Tour==
The tour, which took place in Europe, began in September 1983 in Hitchin, England. Following an initial leg of dates in the United Kingdom and Ireland, a second leg in December reached Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and West Germany.

In March 1984, the group performed its first dates in Italy and Spain. The final date was a one-off show in June supporting Elton John in Ludwigshafen, West Germany, where &quot;People Are People&quot;, the lead single from their next album, made its live debut on the special set. A tour in support of the act&#x27;s subsequent studio release, &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;, followed in September.

==Critical reception==
On the album&#x27;s politically inclined lyrics, Anne Lambert of &quot;Number One&quot; wrote: &quot;[Martin Gore]&#x27;s protest songs are serious and sharply observed, but they retain that distinctive ear for a commercial melody&quot;. She concludes: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to pick out tracks, as the whole effect is sharp, tight, smooth and absolutely riveting!&quot; In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Peter Martin notes that the band&#x27;s attention is now turned &quot;outwards to the world (and all its problems)&quot;, pointing out the Russian, European and Oriental influences apparent in the music. He goes on: &quot;The songs are still electronically based, but the brilliantly melodic and bouncy edge is contrasted by a brooding ″&quot;Tin Drum&quot;″-type sparseness.&quot; Summing up, Martin calls the album &quot;[a] brave departure.&quot;

&quot;New Musical Express&quot; hailed the album, saying that &quot;Everything Counts&quot; &quot;is Mode&#x27;s best ever single [...] It sold because it combines edgy and poignant melodies held in thrilling tension; a tough, urgent dancebeat; and a gleamingly modern sound with an element of quirkiness to mark it out in the crowd. And the same goes for every other track on the album.&quot; Reviewer Mat Snow qualified Alan Wilder&#x27;s composition &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot; as &quot;a haunting melody whose transition from verse to chorus explodes in one of those breathtakingly uplifting moments&quot; and concluded that Depeche Mode &quot;have made a bold and lovely pop record. Simple as that.&quot;

Commenting on the results of the band&#x27;s new line-up, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett considers &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; to be &quot;a bit hit and miss... [although] when it does hit, it does so perfectly&quot;. Singling out &quot;Love, in Itself&quot;, Raggett observes: &quot;Depeche never sounded quite so thick with its sound before, with synths arranged into a mini-orchestra/horn section and real piano and acoustic guitar spliced in at strategic points.&quot; Regarding Wilder&#x27;s songwriting, Raggett states: &quot;Wilder&#x27;s... songwriting contributions are fine musically, but lyrically, &#x27;preachy&#x27; puts it mildly, especially the environment-friendly &#x27;The Landscape Is Changing&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewer Michael Keefe claimed it &quot;marked the shift of this movement away from the band’s bouncier beginnings. Leaving behind the perky synth pop of &#x27;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&#x27; (from &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;) and &#x27;See You&#x27; (of &quot;A Broken Frame&quot;), &#x27;Love, in Itself&#x27; consented to offer a beat you could dance to, but it bore a heart of darkness. Martin Gore expressed his gloomy view on the redemptive potential of love to cure &#x27;All of the absurdities that lay before us / All of the doubts and uncertainties that lay in store for us.&#x27; The track &#x27;Pipeline&#x27;, meanwhile, is unrelentingly depressing. It&#x27;s also overly lethargic. &#x27;More Than a Party&#x27; is up-tempo, but far from upbeat. It&#x27;s seething, pre-industrial groove prefigured the following album&#x27;s musically similar, yet vastly superior, &#x27;Master and Servant&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="709186" wikidata="Q1945546" url="?curid=709186" title="M66 motorway">
<text>The M66, also known as the Bury Easterly Bypass, is a motorway in Lancashire and Greater Manchester, England. It is long and provides part of the route between the M62 and M60 motorways and the M65, with the rest being provided by the A56.

Historically the motorway used to continue southward around the east side of Manchester, but in 1998 this section was renumbered and became part of the M60 Manchester orbital motorway.

==Route==
The M66 starts at the Simister Island, a junction with the M60 and M62, and heads north as a continuation of the M60 as a three-lane dual carriageway. It passes the eastern edge of Whitefield, through junction 3, goes underneath the East Lancashire Railway and enters the suburbs of Bury. It reduces to two lanes at junction 2 and then climbs onto an elevated section, passing through a post war housing estate. At the end of the elevated road, a third climbing lane is added to the summit of the hill. The road then runs to the east of Ramsbottom and the East Lancashire Railway and ends near Edenfield, where the road continues as the A56 dual carriageway.

==History==

In 1949 a report, the Road Plan for Lancashire, proposed the construction of &quot;Route 9&quot; which would link north east Manchester with Burnley and Blackburn via &quot;Route 8&quot;. Originally planned to be an all purpose road. the route was redesignated as a motorway prior to construction. The first section (the so-called &quot;Middleton Link&quot;) was opened in 1971. On the Department for Transport&#x27;s 2002 Roads List this link is listed as the M68. Construction then began on the southern section of the Bury bypass (junctions 4 to 3) in February 1973 with this opening in August 1975. Immediately after construction began on the northern section (junctions 3 to terminus) with this opening in 1978.

The motorway was planned to run down to Stockport where it would meet the M63 and the proposed A6(M) motorway. The first part of this built was the section from the M67 to the M63 (now junctions 24 to 27 of the M60) with construction beginning in 1986 and it opening to traffic in 1989.

The final section of the motorway was to be between the M67 and the Middleton Link. Construction began on this in 1995. In 1998 it was decided to rename various sections of motorway (parts of the M62 and M66 and the whole of the M63) around Manchester to the M60 to form the &quot;Manchester Outer Ring Road&quot;. All sections of the M66 south of the M62 were therefore redesignated as the M60. This final section subsequently opened in 2000.

North of the M66, the road was built as the A56, an all purpose A road which connects with the M65 at junction 8.

==Legislation==
Each motorway in England requires that a statutory instrument be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of statutory instruments relating to the route of the M66.

<text>Baruch Epstein or Baruch ha-Levi Epstein (1860–1941) () was an Ashkenazi Jewish rabbi, best known for his &quot;Torah Temimah&quot; commentary on the Torah. He was the son of Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein, rabbi of Novarodok and author of the work &quot;Arukh HaShulkhan&quot;.

==Biography==
Epstein grew up in Novarodok, where his father was the communal rabbi, but moved to the city of Pinsk after his marriage to the daughter of Rabbi Elazar Moshe Horowitz, and lived there until his death, apart from a period from 1923 to 1926, which he spent in the United States looking (unsuccessfully) for a rabbinic position. During this period he served as the first &quot;menahel&quot; (director) of Ezras Torah from around 1924 until he was succeeded by Rav Henkin around the year 1925.

Although Epstein was a bookkeeper by profession, he had been a student at the Volozhin Yeshiva under his uncle Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (who became his brother-in-law after being widowed and remarrying Epstein&#x27;s sister). Epstein authored a number of popular and scholarly works which are still used widely.

Epstein died of natural causes in the Jewish hospital when Pinsk was under Nazi occupation.

==Works==
* &quot;Torah Temimah&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Torah&quot;, a reference to Psalms 19:8) - a commentary on the Torah and the Five Megillot citing all quotes of a particular verse in the Oral Torah (Talmud or Midrash), and giving textual explanations.
* &quot;Baruch she-Amar&quot; (&quot;Praised He Who Spoke&quot;, a reference to the opening paragraph of the Verses of Praise, daily morning prayers) - Multiple volumes, including a commentary on the siddur (Jewish prayerbook), Passover Haggadah and Pirkei Avot (Ethics of Our Fathers).
* &quot;Mekor Baruch&quot; (&quot;Source of Blessing&quot;) - autobiographical work with notes on life in the Volozhin &quot;yeshiva&quot; and his uncle. Selections were translated as &quot;My Uncle the Netziv&quot;.
* &quot;Mekor Baruch&quot;- on the Jerusalem Talmud
* &quot;Tosefet Beracha&quot; (&quot;Added Blessing&quot;) - novellae on the Torah

<doc id="709196" wikidata="Q114319" url="?curid=709196" title="River Ribble">
<text>The River Ribble runs through North Yorkshire and Lancashire in Northern England. It starts close to the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, and is one of the few that start in the Yorkshire Dales and flow westwards towards the Irish Sea (the Dee in Dentdale and the Twiss in Kingsdale being notable others).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ribble&quot; may be a Brittonic compound-formation. The second element is the noun &quot;*pol&quot;, with connotations including &quot;puddle, pond, upland-stream&quot; (Welsh &quot;pwll&quot;). The first is &quot;rö-&quot;, an intensive prefix, with nouns meaning &quot;great&quot; (Welsh &quot;rhy-&quot;, Cornish re-).

Ribble may once have been known as &quot;*Bremetonā-&quot;, underlying the name &quot;Bremetenacum&quot;, the Roman fort at Ribchester. Involved here is the Brittonic root &quot;*breμ–&quot;, meaning &quot;roaring&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;brefu&quot;), as observed at the river-names Breamish in Northumberland, Braan in Scotland and Brefi in Wales.

==History==
Neolithic to Saxon finds from along the River Ribble during the creation of the Preston Docks and others revealed man has been in the area for a long time. The River Ribble looked completely different then and the coastline is likely to have been much further inland than it is at present where land has been reclaimed and the marsh extended out into the River Ribble due to sedimentation.

The Ribble would appear to have been known in Roman times as the Belisama, possibly giving its name to Samlesbury. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Belisama aest.&quot; seems to represent the estuary of the Ribble. Bremetennacum was a Roman fort that guarded a crossing-point of the river at Ribchester. Remains of another Roman site were discovered at Walton-le-Dale in the mid-19th century.

The Cuerdale Hoard, the largest Viking silver hoard ever found outside Russia was discovered in 1840 on the southern bank of a bend of the river, at Cuerdale near Preston. Whilst the medieval silver Mitton Hoard was found near where this river joins the River Hodder in 2009.

At one time the Ribble marked the northernmost extent of the ancient kingdom of Mercia. At the time of the Domesday Book, the river formed the northern boundary of an area of land (known as &quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot;) that was included in the Domesday information for Cheshire, though it was probably not formally part of the county of Cheshire.

Sawley Abbey was founded by Cistercian monks in 1147, at a bend in the river. It is thought that the monks built a weir to supply a mill race that powered a corn mill within the abbey precinct.
After his defeat in the Battle of Hexham in 1464 (during the Wars of the Roses), King Henry VI went into hiding at a number of houses belonging to his supporters. A little over a year later he was at Waddington Hall in Waddington. On 13 July 1465, a group of Yorkists, including the property-owner&#x27;s brother, arrived at the hall to arrest him. Escaping into nearby woods, Henry was captured soon after crossing the river at the old stepping stones at Brungerley.

Around 1785, a large weir was constructed across the river, slightly downstream at Waddow Hall, to supply water to a cotton mill at Low Moor. The site relied on water power right up to closure around 1930, although the water wheels gradually gave way to water turbines and were augmented by steam engines.

During 2009, an Archimedean screw type hydropower station was constructed at Settle weir near Bridge End Mill. Built for a community-owned company, Settle Hydro, the site became operational by the end of the year. As of February 2024, the generator has produced 1.2 million kWh of electricity.

==Geography==
The Ribble begins at the confluence of the &quot;Gayle Beck&quot; and &quot;Batty Wife Beck&quot; near the viaduct at Ribblehead, in the shadow of the Yorkshire three peaks. It is the only major river rising in Yorkshire which flows westward. It flows through Settle, Clitheroe, Ribchester and Preston, before emptying into the Irish Sea between Lytham St. Annes and Southport, a length of . Its main tributaries are the Hodder and Calder which join the river near Great Mitton, the River Darwen which joins at Walton-le-Dale and the River Douglas which joins near Hesketh Bank.

Above Hellifield the valley of the river is known as Ribblesdale.

The Ribble Way is a long-distance footpath which follows the river for much of its course. The river is connected to both the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Lancaster Canal (via the Ribble Link). The river downstream of Preston was actively dredged when Preston was an active port; this is no longer done and silt from the river is now spreading more widely over the (sand) beaches around Fairhaven and St. Annes.

Its estuary forms part of the Ribble and Alt Estuaries Special Protection Area for wildlife. An average of 340,000 water birds over-winter in the estuary making it the most important wetland site in Britain. The Ribble is also a key breeding ground for the endangered Atlantic salmon.

1.25 million people live in the Ribble&#x27;s catchment area.

The Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river is at Fishwick Bottoms, between Preston and Walton-le-Dale, from the sea.

The River Ribble has the third-largest tides in England, with tides that run at and a tidal range at the mouth of the river of during spring tides. Since River Ribble dredging ceased, the estuary is filling up with sand and is developing a meandering path, depending on the tides and river runoff. In addition, many tributaries flow into the main channel including the Savick Brook/Ribble Link, while the River Douglas, has a significant influence both on sediment transport and hydrodynamics of the estuary.

==Crossings==

There was a bridge at Edisford, Clitheroe in 1339. The age of the present sandstone bridge is not known, but parts contain features indicating they may date to the late medieval period. The current Ribchester Bridge dates from 1774. It replaced one built in 1669, which also had a predecessor of unknown age.

Evidence of a bridge between Preston and Walton-le-Dale occurs in a deed in the early 13th century. A stone bridge was built in the early 1400s, possibly just west of the present Walton Bridge which was completed in 1781. Until 1755 this was the only bridge over the Ribble at Preston. The original attempt to build a bridge directly to Penwortham was completed in 1755, only to collapse the following year. The Penwortham Old Bridge opened in 1759 to replace it. In 1802 the Lancaster Canal Company completed a timber trestle bridge to facilitate a temporary tramroad to connect the two isolated sections of the canal. The missing section was never completed and, although heavily modified, the disused Old Tramroad Bridge still stands today.

===Ferries (historic)===
Several ferry crossings were marked along the lower part of the river, on the first Ordnance Survey map of Lancashire, published in the 1840s. The Hacking Ferry near Hacking Hall and Trowers Ferry near Dinckley Hall. Another, downstream of Osbaldeston Hall and the Balderstone Hall Ferry. Also at Samlesbury Church as well as an old boat house, upstream of Penwortham Old Bridge.

It is uncertain when these services began. A 1354 charter assigned some land for the use of the ferryman near Ribchester, possibly referring to the crossing near Osbaldeston Hall. The Hacking Ferry seems to have been funded by the Shireburn family of Stonyhurst, and established during the 1600s. It continued operating as a regular toll service until 1938, but continued occasionally afterward until it finally ceased operation in 1955. In later years it operated two johnboat-type rowing boats. The older boat could carry twelve passengers and a newer boat had a capacity of 19. The former is now in the collection at Clitheroe Castle Museum.

===Estuary crossing proposals===

A Ribble estuary fixed crossing has been proposed on several occasions, to provide a quicker route between the seaside resorts of Southport and Blackpool. Two routes for a tramroad were proposed; the first in 1899 outlined a route between Crossens and Lytham, then between 1900 and 1906 as a route from Crossens to Warton via Hesketh Bank. A railway tunnel was proposed in 1907, between Hesketh Bank and Warton. A bridge was proposed between 1938 and 1947. A road link was campaigned for in 2007, envisaging a development similar to the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany. In 2011, an April fools&#x27; joke suggested a road tunnel from Marshside to Lytham St Annes.

==Ecology==
The River Ribble catchment is covered by the Ribble Rivers Trust, a UK based charity working to improve, protect and promote the River Ribble for both people and wildlife. The Ribble Estuary is an Internationally important Ramsar Wetland site, a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, a Marine Conservation Zone up to Samlesbury, Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a National Nature Reserve, and is under development as a Coast &amp; Wetlands Regional Park.

Preston City Council published plans to build a barrage across the River Ribble, in their &#x27;Riverworks&#x27; proposals (2006). The aim of these proposals was to build a barrage and a water sports park on a section of the Ribble, coupled with over 4,000 units of housing and businesses in the river&#x27;s flood plain. Some local residents opposed these plans, arguing that they endanger wildlife, increase flood risk to local housing and damage greenbelt areas. These residents set up the Save The Ribble campaign, and their two-year information campaign successfully overturned Preston City Council&#x27;s proposals, and South Ribble Borough Council announced the alternative creation of a Country Park. Parts of the river are a County Biological Heritage Site.

<doc id="709197" wikidata="Q996154" url="?curid=709197" title="Wolfsbane (character)">
<text>Wolfsbane (Rahne Sinclair) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is commonly associated with the X-Men. A Scottish mutant, Wolfsbane can transform into a wolf or a transitional state somewhere between human and wolf, similar to a werewolf. She honed her powers to shift between human and wolf characteristics but must keep her feral instincts at bay when she does.

She was initially a member of the X-Men&#x27;s original junior team, The New Mutants. Later on, she joined the Pentagon-sponsored X-Factor and was also associated with the British superhero team Excalibur. She appeared for a time as a teacher at Xavier&#x27;s Academy in New X-Men. She served as a member of the X-Factor Investigations detective agency, until she joined the new incarnation of X-Force.

Wolfsbane has made minor appearances in animated television, and made her live-action debut in the 2020 film &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, portrayed by Maisie Williams.

==Publication history==
Created by the writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, Wolfsbane first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (September 1982), part of the line &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot;. She starred as a founding member of the New Mutants and features nearly in the entire run of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; volume 1 (1983-1991), her last issue being #97, in which she decides to stay in Genosha at the end of the X-Tinction Agenda crossover. When the original five X-Men left &quot;X-Factor&quot; to rejoin the X-Men, Wolfsbane was recruited to join when it became a government operation, in issue #71 (1991) and was featured as a team member through issue #111 (1995) before the title was interrupted by the Age of Apocalypse. Afterward, Wolfsbane left X-Factor to visit her foster mother, Moira MacTaggart and joined Excalibur starting with issue #90 (1995) and appearing through the title&#x27;s conclusion with issue #125 (1998). She was a supporting character in the short-lived &quot;Warlock&quot; comic (1991-2000) featuring the Douglock entity, and then sporadically in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; volume 2 (2004) and New X-Men (2004-2005). With the relaunch of &quot;X-Factor&quot;, volume 3 (2006), Wolfsbane once again saw regular publication as a central team member between issues #1 and #28 (2006-2008), after which she was transferred to the secret strike team X-Force, volume 3 (2008). During this run, she became pregnant by the Asgardian Hrimhari, and with &quot;X-Force&quot; volume 3 #25 (2010), this pregnancy caused her to return to &quot;X-Factor&quot;, starting with issue #207 (2010). With her return, much of the &quot;X-Factor&quot; volume 3 run was dedicated to her pregnancy and her son, Tier, and her last significant appearance was &quot;X-Factor&quot; #258 (2013).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Rahne (pronounced &quot;Rain&quot;) is Scottish (born somewhere in Ross and Cromarty), in the north highlands of Ullapool, Scotland. She was delivered by Moira MacTaggert, who happened to live locally. Rahne&#x27;s mother, a local sex worker, never got to know her as she died in childbirth. Her father was the local Presbyterian minister, Reverend Craig, who raised Rahne as an orphan without revealing that she was his child from an illicit relationship. When she was revealed as a mutant, Reverend Craig led an angry mob intending to burn her at the stake. Rahne was rescued and later adopted by Moira MacTaggert. Later, when she confronts Reverend Craig as an adult, she learns that Reverend Craig is actually her biological father and that her mother had been a sex worker. She is recruited by Professor X to become a student at his School for Gifted Youngsters and to join the original New Mutants.

===New Mutants===
Rahne was one of the original New Mutants, who often operated as adventurers when not in school. Although she was a shy, emotionally repressed girl, Rahne managed to build a strong friendship with Danielle Moonstar and harbor a crush on Sam Guthrie. Danielle discovered she was able to establish a psychic link with Rahne when the latter was transformed. Rahne&#x27;s strict religious upbringing often made her uncomfortable when dealing with mythological entities, her sorceress teammate Magik, or demons, as well as making her uncomfortable almost to the point of self-loathing with her superhuman power, which resembles the transformations of a werewolf. The clash between the intense joy of using her powers and the conflicting emotions was causing her inner turmoil. She was disturbed to find herself attracted to Hrimhari, a shapeshifting wolf prince, while in Asgard, and although he became her first serious love, she decided to return to Earth.

Rahne eventually began a relationship with teammate Cypher, and was devastated when he was killed by the Ani-Mator. On one of her two visits to Asgard, she met the demonic Garmr, a gigantic wolf who guards the entrance to the netherworld. She confesses to Rictor that Garm&#x27;s face, &#x27;that devil&#x27;s face&#x27;, is what she sometimes perceives when looking into the mirror. Later, she begins an innocent romance with Rictor, but this proves to be short-lived.

===&quot;X-Factor&quot;===
During the 1990 &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; storyline, Rahne is mentally bonded to Havok against her will by the scientists who genetically engineer mutant slaves in the nation of Genosha. She is subsequently manipulated by the Shadow King, into joining X-Factor as a United States government special operative. Her bond with Havok causes her to act irrationally, sometimes threatening teammates, sometimes by flirting with them. She stays in half-wolf forms for this time because turning completely human causes her to revert to the slave identity that the Genoshans had created for her. She makes more than one attempt to undo the bonding, with varying results. Her instability also manifests in many odd dreams, in which her identity is merged with pop culture figures. The Genoshan damage is eventually undone by Haven.

Wolfsbane appears in the 1992 miniseries &quot;The Infinity War&quot; and its 1993 sequel, &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot;. During the first storyline, she is part of the rear guard who stayed behind on Earth at the Fantastic Four headquarters. Various evil doubles attack the building and the assembled heroes. During &quot;Crusade&quot;, Wolfsbane&#x27;s deep religious beliefs lead her to be approached by the main villain, the Goddess. Wolfsbane, along with many other religious heroes, is brainwashed as part of the Goddess&#x27; army but Wolfsbane&#x27;s identity is restored by the storyline&#x27;s conclusion.

===Excalibur===
Sometime after her mental damage from the Genoshan bonding process was undone, she returned to MacTaggert&#x27;s base on Muir Island and joined Excalibur. She matures much in her tenure in the book. She develops deep friendships with her allies, including Peter Rasputin and Kitty Pryde. She is depicted as having overcome much of her previous shyness, not caring if the general public of a small town saw her in a revealing uniform. Rahne also was a bridesmaid in the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan. Following the disbanding of Excalibur, she and teammate Douglock stay on Muir Island to assist Moira in her attempts to cure the Legacy Virus. Rahne appears in many issues of the short-lived comic book series &quot;Warlock&quot;, which starred Douglock. She helps him and others confront various threats revolving around Douglock&#x27;s assimilation powers. She assists the Avengers in confronting one of the larger threats that nearly overwhelm New York City. The island comes under attack by the Brotherhood, resulting in Moira&#x27;s death, the destruction of the island, and the suppression of Rahne&#x27;s mutant powers when Mystique shoots her with a version of Forge&#x27;s Neutralizer.

===Xavier Institute===

Rahne spends some time motorcycling across the United States following the loss of her powers, having developed a new, less introverted persona. This involves the growing out of her hair from its normal short buzz-cut and the loss of her Scottish . Upon her return to New York, she single-handedly defeats the rampaging villain Avalanche. She becomes both a teaching assistant at the Xavier Institute and a part-time employee of Jamie Madrox&#x27;s detective agency, X-Factor Investigations.

Prior to her joining the Institute faculty, Rahne becomes involved in a relationship with Elixir. A passionate encounter between the two causes Elixir&#x27;s mutant healing abilities to restore Rahne&#x27;s powers, but she accidentally injures him. Elixir is able to heal himself, and Rahne is brought back to her senses by an encounter with Danielle Moonstar on the darkened streets of Salem Center. Rahne opts to end the relationship when she is hired as a teacher for the institute. Though Rahne is initially resistant to continuing the relationship, the two began seeing one another secretly until Rahne ended it upon learning that Elixir&#x27;s classmate Wallflower is interested in him. Rahne&#x27;s ending of the relationship is overheard by Wither, and he later releases the information to the whole school in an attempt to end Elixir&#x27;s budding relationship with Wallflower. In the wake of this, Rahne resigns from the school, and her formerly close friendship with Dani Moonstar, Elixir&#x27;s legal guardian, becomes strained.

===X-Factor Investigations===
Rahne begins working full-time for X-Factor, reuniting her with a former love interest and New Mutants teammate Rictor, now depowered. Many aspects of her previous persona return, including her close-cropped hairstyle and Scottish accent. She attends church meetings each week and her devout Presbyterian religiosity remains a central aspect of her character. She is instrumental in stopping a riot in what was known as &#x27;Mutant Town&#x27;, a section of New York once dominated by mutants. She threatens to kill anyone who attacks it. Threats were then made against the police who objected to her actions.

She helps rescue new teammate Layla Miller from the orphanage where (X-Factor has been led to believe) she was being abused. Rahne is later distressed by a vision, implanted by Tryp, of a possible future where she murders Jamie Madrox and a grown-up Layla Miller on their wedding day. She has told X-Factor psychiatrist Doc Samson that she has even considered killing herself to prevent it from happening but &quot;Suicides go to hell... but so do murderers. So, I&#x27;m damned if I do and damned if I don&#x27;t.&quot;

Rahne gets herself together. She is seen helping her friend Guido Carosella confront personal problems of his own that have arisen from confrontations with the evil Damian Tryp.

Later in the series, Rahne attempts to comfort Rictor, who is distressed about the loss of his powers again, which results in a burgeoning romance between the two, this concludes when she leaves X-Factor to join X-Force.

It is later implied that Emma Frost has blackmailed Rahne with her previous relationship with Elixir into keeping an eye on Wither.

===&quot;Messiah Complex&quot;===
During the 2007–2008 &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; storyline, Rahne helps Rictor infiltrate the Purifiers; she fakes being shot by Rictor. She is also a member of the new X-Force. During a battle against Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers, Rahne learns that Father Craig was in league with the Purifiers, supposedly divulging enough information about her that the Purifiers can claim to &quot;know her well.&quot; She travels with X-Force to her former home Muir Island, now the base of the Marauders. During the climactic battle, Rahne is injured by Riptide, but her wounds, according to Professor X, are superficial and she will recover.

===X-Force===
When Cyclops decides to reform X-Force after the events of &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, he brings Rahne along to meet with Wolverine. She determinedly accompanies him on the assault on the Purifiers&#x27; base, only to be captured by Matthew Risman who shoots her in the knee when X-23 makes a move against him. While her teammates make an attempt to rescue her, they fail and Rahne is taken to an undisclosed Purifier base where she finds out that Reverend Craig has joined the ranks of the Purifiers.

The rest of the X-Force manage to rescue her but discover that she has been injected with a near-lethal dose of heroin. She is immediately taken to Angel&#x27;s mansion to be healed by Elixir. However, after she wakes up, she immediately attacks Worthington, rips out his wings, and takes them to Reverend Craig.

Josh&#x27;s name is the second word Rahne says as she awakens from her brainwashed state and finds herself in a dark room somewhere in the facility. She realizes that she can&#x27;t use her powers thanks to the handcuffs she is wearing. She then remembers being brainwashed by Reverend Craig. After Reverend Craig tries to kill her, she escapes, but not before admitting that the only thing she wanted was her father&#x27;s love.

Rahne regroups with her teammates, and they begin their assault against Bastion, the Choir, and the Purifiers. As everyone is distracted in the bloody battle, Rahne is shot by her father who follows her blood trail into the room where Angel&#x27;s severed wings are held. Reverend Craig condemns Wolfsbane again, which triggers her to knock him into the ground, stating that she only wanted to save him but after everything that&#x27;s happened, she doesn&#x27;t care for him any longer and walks away, turning her back on him. Craig screams and prepares to shoot his daughter in the back and as he moves, Rahne turns and sees Angel&#x27;s wings behind her father, giving him the appearance of an angel. Her brainwashing kicks in once again as she mutters &quot;kill the angel&quot; and she enters a feral state, attacking her father. Her teammates find her at the epilogue of the battle in her human form, praying and surrounded by blood and clothes, but no corpse of her father is found. Her teammates hope that she will never recall the memory of apparently devouring her father which would only trigger a deeper psychological shock.

Following the death of Risman, the team reconvenes at Angel&#x27;s Aerie to recuperate and plan their next move. Rahne&#x27;s sleeper programming is still active, and she violently charges Angel when she sees him, provoking him to transform into Archangel in retaliation. X-23 calls in the Stepford Cuckoos to help undo the damage done to Wolfsbane, prevent her from attacking her teammates, and overcome the guilt of her actions.

Before they can erase her memories, they are interrupted, and X-Force is sent on a mission, leaving Rahne alone. While alone, she notices someone outside; after running away, it is revealed to be Hrimhari, the Wolf Prince from Asgard. Since then the Cuckoos began searching for her but Cerebra could not detect her, mainly because she was in her wolf form. She was at Angel&#x27;s Aerie with Hrimhari, still conflicted over her experience with the Purifiers. Hrimhari states that the gods of Asgard have reunited them for a reason and if they can forgive her, then she can do the same for herself. After having sex, the two were attacked by a trio of Frost Giants. Hrimhari wanted to fight them off alone, but Rahne refused to leave him and stated that she was no longer afraid of what she is. The two managed to defeat the Frost Giants and although seemingly unharmed, Rahne fainted right afterwards.

===Secret Invasion===
Rahne is among the several X-Men helping to fight off Skrulls during their invasion of San Francisco; X-Force were tasked with capturing one of the new Super Skrulls, so Beast could study it to find a weakness.

===Necrosha===
After Rahne fell unconscious, she was brought to Utopia. There it has been revealed by Dr. Nemesis that she is pregnant with the Wolf Prince&#x27;s child (a child, according to him, that is neither human nor mutant) and the unborn child is threatening her health and her life. The Wolf Prince later made a deal with the Asgardian goddess of the Underworld, Hela. He gave his soul to Hela in exchange that she restore Elixir to life (after she refused to save Rahne and the baby); she promptly did so and they returned to the Asgardian Underworld together, the Wolf Prince&#x27;s final words being that he would somehow find his way back to Rahne and their unborn child. Elixir then healed Rahne and stated to her that the genetics of the baby are similar to humans but stronger. He further transferred some of the fetus&#x27; strength to Rahne so that she would survive the birth of the baby. While on Genosha, he further stated that he believed that her baby will be very strong and that not even a bullet could pierce her skin now, due to her now-different skin and muscle density. Later on, Rahne further demonstrated enhanced strength and senses.

===Return to X-Factor Investigations===
The character returns on the last panel of &quot;X-Factor&quot; #207, obviously pregnant, and walks in on Rictor and Shatterstar in an intimate embrace. In issue #208, she is flabbergasted at first of Rictor being with Shatterstar (just as Rictor is about her being pregnant). After a short moment of confusion, she attacks Shatterstar and throws him through the window, landing on the streets where she claims that Shatterstar must be mind-controlling Rictor. After both are stopped by Longshot, Rictor tells her that he is not mind-controlled, to which she asks how he could be with Shatterstar when he was with her before. Rictor answers that it is complicated and demands that Wolfsbane tell him whether he is the father of her child. After hesitating to answer and after another demand from Rictor and looking at Shatterstar, Rahne states that she was not with anyone but him seven months before and then throws herself into the arms of a bewildered Rictor. After Madrox asked about whether she wants to cover her body while still in bed, she stated that she will do it to protect his sensibilities and that she has been running around naked so often lately that she had lost her blushes. Later on, when Rictor (believing himself to be the father) accompanied Rahne to a physician specialized in &#x27;super-types&#x27;, it was revealed that although the heartbeat could clearly be heard, the ultrasound examination did not show any picture on the screen. The physician, who at first had trouble believing Rictor to be the father, stated that not even ultrasound can get into Rahne&#x27;s womb and that this seemed to be a kind of protective function, a mystical one rather than biological. Shatterstar, simultaneously, made the discovery that Hrimhari was the child&#x27;s father. By this time, Rictor had already figured out that he was not the father due to the child&#x27;s mystical nature. Layla Miller stated that Rahne had not lied to anybody and after Rictor found her again, Rahne revealed that her pregnancy happened a lot faster than a human one due to Hrimhari&#x27;s and her lupine nature. She also stated that she was still worried that Rictor &#x27;became&#x27; gay because she left him and that she wanted to bring him back to &#x27;her team&#x27; because she believes that gay people go to Hell, although she does not want that to be true. Rictor reassured her of their friendship and the two reconciled.

Later, as she left the office to go to church, she ran into Shatterstar, who wanted to mark his territory over Rictor and make peace with her. At the church, they encountered a powerful Sin-Eater demon seeking Rahne&#x27;s child; it fled after a battle, shortly before Feral—previously deceased—announced herself to the pair. Feral is revealed to have arrived as a tether to the world of the living for various canine and feline gods and demons which want Rahne&#x27;s baby; as more powerful assailants pour in, the pair attempt to regroup at X-Factor headquarters. Rahne gives birth to the baby through her mouth as opposed to the normal birth procedure. The newborn jumps up and attacks Agamemnon with rage and bloodlust. Rahne is completely freaked out and denounces her newborn son. Rahne says to herself that this was her punishments for the sins she committed while being on X-Force. Jack Russell adopts her son and cares for him. Rahne feels terrible remorse for abandoning her child to the point she tries to eat ice cream to the point of throwing up.

Rahne is guilt-ridden following her abandonment of her son, and comes to fear that her soul will go to Hell. Terry and Lorna take Rahne on a road trip to Vermont, where they meet Father John Madrox, a dupe of Madrox who has become a priest. Rahne reveals to Father John her repressed memories of being on X-Force and was brainwashed into eating her own father. Though shocked, Father John counsels her to let go of her self-pity and judgmental attitude, in lieu of a more positive outlook, which prompts Rahne to resolve to search for her son. Rahne, Rictor and Shatterstar find her son, Tier, and decide to leave X-Factor Investigations to live safely with him and Jack Russell, Werewolf by Night.

Shortly after, the &quot;Hell on Earth War&quot; storyline brings both Tier and Rahne away from Jack Russell and again involved with X-Factor, with Tier as the focal point of a competition for power among six Hell Lords: Mephisto, Asmodeus, Satannish, Satana, Pluto, and Hela. Tier dies by the conflict&#x27;s conclusion, while Rahne is stranded in the Arctic wilderness but eventually rescued. When last seen, Rahne has agreed to train for a role of deaconess in John Madrox&#x27;s church.

===Secret Empire===
When Hydra takes over the United States and displaces mutants to New Tian, Rahne joins a strike force assembled by the New Tian government. It is also revealed that she underwent a secondary mutation that allows her to split into five smaller wolves.

===New Mutants: Dead Souls===
Rahne joins Magik&#x27;s team of New Mutants. She also forgives Strong Guy, who also joins the team, for killing her son. She is later infected by the Transmode Virus and manipulated by an insane Karma.

===Last X-Men and Death===
Rahne and the other New Mutants are taken prisoners by O*N*E. She and Magik are able to resist the Transmode Virus&#x27; effects, which she theorizes that it may be because of their shapeshifting abilities. She joins Cyclops&#x27;s team of X-Men. Eventually, she realizes that she doesn&#x27;t want to act like a monster anymore and quits the team. However, not long after, she is approached by some young men who realize that she is a mutant and beat her to death. She is mourned by her teammates.

===Dawn of X===
Rahne is resurrected on Krakoa by The Five and rejoins the New Mutants. After going on several missions with the team, bringing more Mutants to the island, training the islands youth at the Akadamos Habitat and getting help for her trauma with Dani. She began wondering why her son Tier had not been revived yet, but when she asked The Five about it they told her Cerebro was still picking up copies for him implying he&#x27;s still alive. Upon being told they wouldn&#x27;t resurrected Tier without proof of Death, she went back to Dani to cry.

The Shadow King later took advantage of her grief to get close to her and then controlled her, using her to bring her student Gabrielle Kinney Scout to him so he could kill her to stop her from interfering with his mentorship of her friends. The next day she saw No-Girl trying to control The Five into resurrecting Gabby and after revealing she had no memory of the conversation they&#x27;d recently had, realised the Shadow King manipulated her.

After getting Gabby revived, Rahne and the New Mutants went to confront the Shadow King who trapped them in the Astral Plane, after being rescued by their protégé&#x27;s The Lost Club. They were able to find the consciousnesses of the real Amahl Ferouk, and free him from the malevolent entity that had been controlling him since childhood.

Rahne and Dani objected to Magik planning to hand over rulership of Limbo to Madelyne Pryor, so Illyana offered to take them with her to witness the handover. This was invaded by an army of demons led by S&#x27;ym, who wanted to take Limbo for himself and had his own weapon which was able to disarm Magik&#x27;s soulsword. The four women were forced to flee back to Krakoa but Magik&#x27;s portal failed and they found themselves stranded in a different part of Limbo. There they met an older Magik who was now using Warlock in place of her Soulsword. She revealed to them that she&#x27;d been trapped in Limbo for any years fighting Technarchy infected Demons and she and Worlock were the last two Mutants alive. After watching her defeat S&#x27;ym once and for all the team went further into Limbo. Finding themselves in a fairytale world based on Alice in Wonderland, they were ambushed by guards of the Red King (Balisco) and separated from Magik. After spending the night in prison, where she and Dani unsuccessfully tried to convince Madelyne to embrace the promises of Krakoa. She, Dani and Madelyne were used as live bait to trap Magik, who arrived alongside Colossus and a younger version of herself who was still Balisco&#x27;s prisoner. After the much stronger older Illyana was able to defeat the Red King, the younger Illyana undid her spell turning the fairytale world back into Balisco&#x27;s castle and once again the group set forth further into Limbo. After months of waiting in a cave while Magik continues training Madelyne, They stage an assault on the castle hoping to take Limbo back from S&#x27;ym. While initially successful, when they get inside the wall they realise S&#x27;ym is being helped by another version of Magik created by Limbo. The main Illyana allows her doppelganger to think she has the upper hand then Madelyne killed her, causing the two to merge making Magik once again powerful enough to send them home.

==Powers and abilities==

Wolfsbane is a mutant with the ability to transform into a wolf at will, while retaining her human intelligence, or into a transitional form which combines human and aspects. While this ability is lycanthropy, it is not magical in nature, but instead a complex biological function involving the mutant X-gene. She can change into a humanoid lupine form resembling a werewolf, or become an actual wolf. In either form, Wolfsbane has enhanced senses of hearing, sight, and smell (similar to those of a wolf&#x27;s, but also superior to them); animal-like strength, agility, and reflexes; razor-sharp talons and fangs; and bestial instincts. In lupine form she can also see into the infrared and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby enabling her to perceive heat patterns and to see in the dark. In her lupine form she can also hear sounds and detect scents outside the normal human range. In her transitional form she is less agile than she is as a wolf, but stronger than she is in human form. In her transitional form she can speak, use her forepaws as hands and easily stand erect, and at least some of her senses remain superhumanly acute. Danielle Moonstar&#x27;s former telepathic talent, which enabled her to communicate with animals, allowed her to communicate with Wolfsbane to a limited degree when she was in her lupine form or &quot;transitional&quot; humanoid-wolf form; in lupine form Wolfsbane may have more difficulty understanding complex human concepts. Rahne later learned to enter different transitional forms which vary slightly in appearance. In her &quot;absolute&quot; lupine form, she possesses superhuman strength and durability. She possesses regenerative abilities which allow her to recover from injuries in a few days which would incapacitate a normal human for weeks or months.

Wolfsbane&#x27;s human form is normal in appearance, originally with the exception that her hair never grew more than a few centimeters long; this limitation has since been removed by a temporary biological change into a &quot;mutate&quot; by the Genengineer on the island of Genosha during the X-Tinction Agenda storyline. The artificial mutation process Wolfsbane underwent caused her to act with animalistic savagery in her lupine and &quot;absolute&quot; forms. Rahne was shown to exhibit her keen sense of smell while in human form, sensing traces of blood and spittle on teammate Strong Guy&#x27;s hand, (identifying who the fluids belonged to) despite him having already wiped it clean. This was followed by Siryn&#x27;s sonic-scream, leaving Wolfsbane&#x27;s &quot;doggy-ears...ringing for a week&quot; implying her hearing is also enhanced in human form. Rahne mentions to Rictor that she indeed has her wolf senses in her human form but changed the subject before explaining further.

While a member of the second X-Factor team, Rahne wears a special uniform made of &quot;unstable molecules&quot; that converts to a collar in her non-human forms.

After her teammate Elixir alters her DNA to match that of her unborn child&#x27;s strength, Rahne demonstrates greatly increased superhuman strength. Elixir also believes her skin to have become bulletproof, which she later corroborates. Her senses are further heightened to the point that she is able to smell a missing teammate nearly a mile away and underground. After giving birth to her child, these extra abilities fade, and she returns to her original levels of strength and durability.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Wolfsbane 50th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, Comic Book Resources (CBR) ranked Wolfsbane 18th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list, and 17th in their &quot;X-Force: 20 Powerful Members&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline of the 1995–1996 &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, Rahne finds herself stuck in her lupine form and is a companion to the Dark Beast. When this reality was revisited ten years later in &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Rahne has been rescued and has begun to rediscover of her humanity again. She is now capable of shifting into her hybrid form but is still very feral in her mindset.

===Age of X===
In the alternate reality seen in the 2011 &quot;Age of X&quot; storyline, Wolfsbane is briefly sheltered from the government by the Fantastic Four, but her presence is betrayed by the Invisible Woman after she accidentally attacks Franklin Richards, resulting in all of the team but Invisible Woman being arrested.

===Days of Future Past===
An alternate future version of Rahne from the timeline originated by the 1981 &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline appears in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #94. She spends much of her time viewing recorded images of death and destruction. She, along with a few surviving friends, participates in a raid on a Black Air facility.

===Mutant X===
In the alternate reality of the 1998–2001 series &quot;Mutant X&quot;, Rahne works alongside many of her New Mutant counterparts, making a living as thieves, living in the sewers and calling themselves &quot;Marauders.&quot; She and her friends barely survive a mission in which they steal container that unbeknownst to them, contains Dracula.

===Mys-Tech Wars===
An alternate universe version of Rahne, along with alternates of her X-Factor teammates, appears in issue #3 of &quot;Mys-Tech Wars&quot; to fight alongside the Earth-616 heroes. She does not survive through the violence that follows.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Wolfsbane makes cameo appearances in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;. She is seen on a viewscreen in her human form and receives passing mention in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #43, during the selection process for Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow, in which the President of the United States says &quot;No to the wolf girl.&quot; In issue #50, she is seen in her hybrid form at a Coney Island freak show. In issue #95 however, it is revealed that the Ultimate Alpha Flight member Sasquatch (who first appeared in issue #94) is in fact Rahne Sinclair, making it her first official named appearance. She and the rest of her team use a power enhancing drug known as Banshee, the Ultimate version of Mutant Growth Hormone, which can induce a secondary mutation, or further an existing mutation, for example turning Angel into a large anthropomorphic eagle. While using the drug, Rahne can still revert to a more human appearance that resembles a Sasquatch. Later in the same issue, she is injured by Nightcrawler, who, while trying to teleport her away, severs half of her right arm.

===What If===
Rahne appears in some &quot;What If?&quot; stories:

* In &quot;What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?&quot; Yet a preteen in this incarnation, she joins Moira McTaggert on a journey to look after Moira&#x27;s old lover, Charles Xavier, following another severe punishment at the hands of Reverend Craig. Meeting Hank McCoy, they learn from him about the X-Men&#x27;s secret and their deaths on Krakoa, during the events of the 1975 book &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1. They remain at the Xavier institute to look after the Professor, who has grown despondent over the loss of his students. When Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men later attempt to blackmail the United States government, Beast hastily assembles a mutant hero team to engage them, but Rahne is accidentally taken along as well. When Beast&#x27;s team is brought into dire straits by the Ani-Men, Xavier telepathically awakens Rahne&#x27;s latent shapechanging potential, which allows her to rescue her friends. Afterwards, Rahne joins the newly formed X-Men as a &quot;charter member&quot;, although she is last seen wearing her own personal costume.
* In &quot;What if Some of the X-Men Had Stayed in Asgard?&quot;, Wolfsbane&#x27;s actions diverge from those she committed at the end of &quot;The Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #9 (1985), deciding that she cannot be separated from Hrimhari. Although Hrimhari later dies in battle, he leaves her with three children (depicted as a wolf cub, a human baby, and a wolf-human hybrid baby) and the rulership over his wolf people.

===Wolverine: Rahne of Terra===
An alternate reality version of Rahne, named Princess Rain, appeared prominently in the 1991 graphic novel &quot;Wolverine: Rahne of Terra&quot;. Wolfsbane was transported to the magic-based world of Gesham by the &quot;Mage&quot; (Cable&#x27;s counterpart) in exchange for the Princess Rain, her own counterpart, and brainwashed to make her believe herself to be Rain. This was done in an attempt to save the Princess from a prophecy which apparently said the Princess would die on her sixteenth birthday. Wolverine was taken there by the wizard Magnus (Gesham&#x27;s version of Magneto), who Magnus attempted to mind-control in an attempt to fulfill the prophecy. While there, Rahne encountered counterparts of most of the New Mutants, hallucinating that they were the versions she knew, and gradually remembering who she actually was. Meanwhile, Wolverine killed Magnus at the climax before they both return home.

In the 1995 sequel, &quot;Wolverine: Knight of Terra&quot;, Wolfsbane and Wolverine helped Queen Rain accept the &quot;Beast&quot; which gave her shapeshifting powers, as she was the only one who could control it (since she had rejected it, it had possessed someone else, transforming them into a version of Sabretooth). In this volume, the Queen&#x27;s associates were counterparts to the X-Men, with the role of the Mage being taken by Professor X&#x27;s counterpart, the Shaman.

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future of the 2004-2006 &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; storyline, Wolfsbane is one of the staff at the X-Mansion. She makes brief telepathic contact with the long-lost Danielle. When Skrulls impersonating old X-Men enemies attack the mansion, Wolfsbane sacrifices herself to save many of the surviving children.

<doc id="709199" wikidata="Q1122616" url="?curid=709199" title="Bracket creep">
<text>Bracket creep is usually defined as the process by which inflation pushes wages and salaries into higher tax brackets, leading to fiscal drag. However, even if there is only one tax bracket, or one remains within the same tax bracket, there will still be bracket creep resulting in a higher proportion of income being paid in tax. That is, although the marginal tax rate remains unchanged with inflation, the average tax rate will increase.

Most progressive tax systems are not adjusted for inflation. As wages and salaries rise in nominal terms under the influence of inflation they become more highly taxed, even though in real terms the value of the wages and salaries has not increased at all. The net effect is that in real terms taxes rise unless the tax rates or brackets are adjusted to compensate.

==Examples==
Suppose a person earns $20,000 per year and is liable to 20% tax on earnings above a threshold of $5,000 per year. Then they pay ($20,000–$5,000)*0.2 = $3,000 in taxes, or 15% of their income. Now suppose that due to inflation, their wage goes up by 5%, but the government does not increase the tax threshold. They must now pay ($21,000–$5,000)*0.2 = $3,200 or 15.2% of their income as tax. Thus the proportion of the person&#x27;s income that is paid as tax has increased. The average tax rate went up even though the tax payer remained in the 20% tax bracket. That is, the marginal tax rate did not change. Since the wage increase was due to inflation, the person&#x27;s net real income declined.

In the United States, the Alternative Minimum Tax originally (1971) targeted 155 high-income households; based on 2004 law, it would affect 20% of households by 2010.

== Developments ==
For 2022, the Tax Foundation estimates that &quot;an average New Yorker making around $80,000 a year will be forced to shell out an extra $225 in taxes during this and next year&#x27;s tax seasons&quot;.

==Political dimension==
Nominal bracket creep can easily be countered by a system of index-linked tax brackets, but this may be politically undesirable. Many voters do not perceive the effects of bracket creep, and so the government may prefer to adjust tax brackets manually once every few years: in effect, restoring the real tax rates to their approximate pre-inflation levels but in a way that gives the government the appearance that they are cutting taxes.

<doc id="709209" wikidata="Q1505704" url="?curid=709209" title="Loganberry">
<text>The loganberry (Rubus&quot; × &quot;loganobaccus) is a hybrid of the North American blackberry (&quot;Rubus ursinus&quot;) and the European raspberry (&quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;), accidentally bred in 1881 by James Harvey Logan, for whom they are named. They are cultivated for their edible fruit.

== Description ==
The plant and the fruit resemble the blackberry more than the raspberry, but the fruit color is dark red rather than black.

== Taxonomy ==
The loganberry was derived from a cross between &quot;Rubus ursinus&quot; (&quot;R. vitifolius&quot;) &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27; (octaploid) as the female parent and &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; &#x27;Red Antwerp&#x27; (diploid) as the male parent (pollen source); the loganberry is hexaploid. It was accidentally created in 1881 in Santa Cruz, California, by the American judge and horticulturist James Harvey Logan (1841–1928).

Logan was unsatisfied with the existing varieties of blackberries and tried crossing two varieties of blackberries to produce a superior cultivar. He happened to plant them next to plants of an old variety of red raspberry, &#x27;Red Antwerp&#x27;, all of which flowered and fruited together. The two blackberry cultivars involved in these experiments were probably &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27; and &#x27;Texas Early&#x27; (a cultivar of &quot;Rubus velox&quot;), which were two of the three varieties that Logan had planted in his yard that year.

Logan then gathered and planted the seed from his cross-bred plants. His 50 seedlings produced plants similar to the blackberry parent &#x27;Aughinbaugh&#x27;, but larger and more vigorous. One was the loganberry; the others included the &#x27;Mammoth&#x27; blackberry.

Since Logan&#x27;s time, crosses between the cultivars of raspberry and blackberry have confirmed the loganberry&#x27;s parentage, with an earlier theory that the loganberry originated as a red-fruiting form of the common Californian blackberry &quot;Rubus ursinus&quot; now disproved. Progeny from Logan&#x27;s original plant was introduced to Europe in 1897. A prickle-free mutation of the loganberry, the &#x27;American Thornless&#x27;, was developed in 1933.

The tayberry is a similar raspberry-blackberry hybrid. The &#x27;Phenomenal&#x27; berry or &#x27;Burbank&#x27;s Logan&#x27;, developed by Luther Burbank in 1905, is also a raspberry-blackberry hybrid, but is a second-generation cross (i.e., two first-generation crosses between blackberry and raspberry were then crossed to each other). Other similar hybrids include the nessberry, which is a cross between a dewberry and a red raspberry, and youngberry, a three-way cross between blackberry, raspberry, and dewberry.

The loganberry has been used as a parent in more recent crosses between various &quot;Rubus&quot; species, such as boysenberry (Loganberry × raspberry × blackberry x dewberry), the Santiam blackberry (loganberry × California blackberry [&quot;R. ursinus&quot;]), and the olallieberry (Black Logan × youngberry). The loganberry is part of the ancestral line leading to the Marionberry, a common and popular berry grown mainly in Oregon.

=== Relation to other brambles ===



== Cultivation ==

Loganberry plants are sturdy and more disease- and frost-resistant than many other berries. However, they are not very popular with commercial growers due to several problems which increase labor costs, since the plants tend to be thorny and the berries are often hidden by the leaves. Additionally, berries of varying maturity may grow on a single plant, making it difficult to completely harvest each plant. Loganberries are therefore more commonly grown in household gardens.

A loganberry bush usually produces about ten canes (vines). The canes are not as upright as its raspberry parent, and tend instead to vine more like its blackberry parent. Growth can be undisciplined, with the canes growing five or more feet in a year. Some gardeners train the canes fanwise along a wall or a wire frame. Old canes die after their second year, and should be cut away as they can become diseased, and also hinder harvesting.

The loganberry fruits earlier than its blackberry parent. Fruit is produced for about two months, generally from midsummer until mid-autumn, with a plant at a given time mid-season bearing fruit in different stages, from blossom to maturity. The berries are generally harvested when they are a deep purple color, rather than red. Each bush can produce 7 kg to 8 kg (15 lb to 18 lb) of fruit a year. Plants continue to fruit for around 15 years, and can also self-propagate.

The cultivar &#x27;Ly 654&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==
Loganberries are consumed fresh, or used for juice or in jams, pies, crumbles, fruit syrups, and country wines.

In the UK, fresh or canned (tinned) loganberries are often paired with English Sherry trifle, or their juice (or syrup) paired with the sherry.

Loganberry is a popular beverage flavoring in Western New York and parts of Southern Ontario, beginning there as a drink sold at Crystal Beach Park in Crystal Beach, Ontario. Even though the park has long been closed down, several companies still sell varieties of loganberry drinks through stores throughout the area, which are sold at several local fast-food franchises such as Mighty Taco in Buffalo, Sport of Kings Restaurant in Batavia, New York as well as at supermarkets. There are also milkshakes flavored with loganberry syrup.

== In culture ==

The 1896 book &quot;Santa Cruz County&quot; describes the loganberry thus:The Loganberry originated with Judge J. H. Logan, of Santa Cruz, Cal., from whom it derives its name. Several years ago, growing in his garden, were plants of the Aughinbaugh blackberry and Red Antwerp raspberry. The plants, being near each other, had intermixed or grown together. The judge, having noticed that they bloomed and ripened their fruit together, conceived the idea of planting the seeds, from which planting resulted the production of the Loganberry.
He is entitled to all credit for the origination of this noble fruit, which will be a perpetual monument, placing his name beside those of Longworth, Hovey, Wilson and other originators of new varieties of fruit. He has even done more than they. He has produced a fruit or berry entirely unlike any in previous existence, a hybrid or mixture of two fruits, partaking of the characteristics of both of its parents. The Aughinbaugh blackberry, from the seed of which the Logan is supposed to have originated, has pistillate or imperfect flowers, which must have been fertilized by the pollen of the raspberry, producing this most singular and valuable fruit.
The vines or canes of the Loganberry grow entirely unlike either the blackberry or raspberry. They trail or grow upon the ground more like the dewberry. They are exceedingly strong growers, each shoot or branch reaching a growth of eight to ten feet in one season without irrigation, the aggregate growth of all the shoots on one plant amounting to from forty to fifty feet.
The canes or vines are very largewithout the thorns of the blackberry bushesbut have very fine soft spines, much like those of raspberry bushes. The leaves are of a deep green color, coarse and thick, and also like those of the raspberry. The fruit is as large as the largest size blackberry, is of the same shape, with globules similar to that fruit, and the color, when fully ripe, is a &#x27;dark bright red&#x27;. It has the combined flavor of both berries, pleasant, mild, vinous, delightful to the taste and peculiar to this fruit alone.
It is excellent for the table, eaten raw or cooked, and for jelly or jam is without an equal. The seeds are very small, soft and not abundant, being greatly different from both its parents in this respect. The vines are enormous bearers, and the fruit is very firm and carries well.
The fruit begins to ripen very earlythe bulk being ripe and gone before either blackberries or raspberries become plentiful. In filling in a place just ahead of these fruits the market value of the Loganberry is greatly enhanced. In ordinary seasons the fruit begins to ripen from the middle to the last of May. When extensively planted and generally known, this berry is destined to take front rank owing to its earliness, large size, beautiful appearance, superior quality, and delightful flavor, together with its firmness and good carrying or shipping quality.
Mr. James Waters, of this valley, has sole right with this vine.

Due to its high vitamin C content, the loganberry was used by the British navy at the beginning of the 20th century as a source of vitamin C to prevent sailors from getting scurvy, in much the same way as the British did with limes during the late 18th century. During this period at the beginning of the 20th century, the largest proportion of loganberries grown for the British navy (roughly a third) were grown on a single farm in Leigh Sinton, near Malvern in Worcestershire, England, run by the Norbury family.

<text>Bush regeneration, a form of natural area restoration, is the term used in Australia for the ecological restoration of remnant vegetation areas, such as through the minimisation of negative disturbances, both exogenous such as exotic weeds and endogenous such as erosion. It may also attempt to recreate conditions of pre-European arrival, for example by simulating endogenous disturbances such as fire. Bush regeneration attempts to protect and enhance the floral biodiversity in an area by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment and survival of native plants.

==History==

===Bradley method===
In the early 1960s Joan and Eileen Bradley developed a series of weed control techniques through a process of trial and error. Their work was the beginning of minimal disturbance bush regeneration in New South Wales. The Bradley method urges a naturalistic approach by encouraging the native vegetation to self-reestablish. The Bradleys used their method to successfully clear weeds from a reserve in Ashton Park, part of Sydney Harbour National Park, NSW. The process demonstrated that, following a period of consecutive &#x27;follow up&#x27; treatments of diminishing time requirement, subsequent maintenance was needed only once or twice a year, mainly in vulnerable spots such as creek banks, roadsides, and clearings, to be maintained weed-free.

The aim of their work was to clear small niches adjacent to healthy native vegetation such that the each area will regenerate from in-situ soil seed banks or be re-colonised and stabilised by the regeneration of native plants, replacing an area previously occupied by weeds. The Bradley method follows three main principles, 
#secure the best areas first
#minimise disturbance to the natural conditions (e.g. minimise soil disturbance and off-target damage).
#don&#x27;t overclear, let the regenerative ability of the bush set the pace of clearance (Bradley 1988).
The priority securing of the best quality vegetation aids in preserving areas of top biodiversity which provide regeneration potential to expand these areas and reclaim areas as bushland.

===Modern practice===
The adoption of minimal disturbance bush regeneration increased in the decades that followed the work of the Bradleys. Their principles have guided bushcare programs in Australia, although the inclusion of herbicide in modern bush regeneration is a notable deviation from the ideals of the Bradley sisters. In addition, rather than &#x27;minimal disturbance&#x27;, a more favoured and ecologically sound trend since the 1990s has been towards more &#x27;appropriate disturbance&#x27; as many Australian plant communities require some level of perturbation to trigger germination from long-buried seed banks. This has led to a range of additional disturbance-based techniques (such as burns and soil disturbance) being included in the regenerator&#x27;s &#x27;tool kit&#x27; in dry forest and grassland areas. Field experience has found that, even in rainforest areas, a resilience to disturbance is evident, enabling regenerators to clear weed in a fairly extensive manner to trigger rainforest recovery. This is borne out by a thriving rainforest regeneration industry in northern NSW Australia, modelled on the pioneering work of John Stockard at Wingham Brush (Stockard 1991, Stockard 1999).
The rule of thumb in all cases is to constrain clearing to that area that matches the project&#x27;s follow up resources.

The increased awareness and consideration of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity by citizens has incrementally increased pressure on local governments to adopt conservation programs for remnant vegetation on council land. 
Most peri urban councils now have some involvement in bush regeneration, either through planning, land management, volunteer support or through employment of bush regeneration practitioners. In NSW the level of coordination of bush regeneration programs through local governments is high, although in some other areas at present a lack of coordination is a serious concern in bush regeneration on public land, with only 40% of councils liaising with other councils. In such areas there may be a need for strategic management at a regional scale through Natural Resource Management Boards or non government organisations such as Trees For Life, which are involved in bushcare programs across wider areas. There is increasing interest in using species traits and the grouping of species by their traits into functional types to both predict plant community responses to environmental change and to address hypothesis about the mechanisms underlying these responses.

==Purposes==

The aim of bush regeneration, also known as &#x27;natural area restoration&#x27;, is to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora, this is usually achieved by selectively reducing the competitive interaction with invasive species, or mitigation of negative influences such as weeds or erosion. See also Albert Morris.

Invasive plant species are often the greatest threat to remnant vegetation, and therefore bush regeneration is closely associated with weed abatement activities. Weed management as one aim of bush regeneration, is used to increase native plant recruitment. The management of factors such as fire and herbivory can be just as important, depending on the ecosystem being restored. In recent years research and on-ground management has begun to recognize the importance of ecosystem processes rather ecosystem composition and structure and research into other ways of facilitating native plant recruitment is increasing.

==Technique==

The original Bradley method of bush regeneration focuses on facilitating native plant recruitment from the seedbank, rather than planting seedlings or sowing seeds, as follows: 
Weeding a little at a time from the bush towards the weeds takes the pressure off the natives under favourable conditions. Native seeds and spores are ready in the ground and the natural environment favours plants that have evolved in it. The balance is tipped back towards regeneration. Keep it that way, by always working where the strongest area of bush meets the weakest weeds.

Currently the term &#x27;bush regeneration&#x27; includes activities other than weed removal, such as replanting and introducing species into an area where soil, water, or fire regimes have shifted the type of plant appropriate to the area (e.g. a stormwater drain).

Weed species can be important habitat for native fauna (e.g. blackberry is important habitat for wrens and the southern brown bandicoot) and this should be taken into consideration with bush regeneration, for example by not clearing invasive species until adequate habitat alternatives have been established nearby with native vegetation.

Problems can occur when insufficient follow-up is conducted as the success of bush regeneration is dependent on allowing the native vegetation to regenerate in the area where weeds have been removed.

<text>Normal type (in German: &quot;Normaltyp&quot;) is a typological term in sociology coined by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936). It can be considered both as a forerunner of, and a challenge to, the rather better known concept of Max Weber’s: the ideal type (in German &quot;Idealtyp&quot;).

==Tönnies’ distinctions==

Tönnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptualization (of sociological terms, including ‘normal types’) and the realm of reality (of social action). The first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (pure sociology); the second, empirically and in an inductive way (applied sociology). Following Tönnies, reality (the second realm) cannot be explained without concepts, which belong to the first realm, or else you will fail because you try to define x by something derived from x.

Tönnies’ &quot;Normaltyp&quot; was thus a conceptual tool created on a logical basis, an almost mathematical concept always open to subsequent refinement from a confrontation with the empirical evidence.

The contrast with Weber’s ‘ideal type’ came from the latter’s ‘accentuation’ of certain elements of a real social process, which is under sociological (or historical) scrutiny - “the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view ... of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present and occasionally absent &quot;concrete individual&quot; phenomena”, as Weber himself put it. From Tönnies’ point of view, an ideal type cannot &quot;explain&quot; reality, because it is derived from reality by accentuation, but might help to &quot;understand&quot; reality.

The normal type moved from abstract to concrete; the ideal type from concrete to abstract.

==Weber&#x27;s survival==

Nevertheless, Weber’s term survived in the sociological community, since his &quot;Idealtyp&quot; helped to understand social forces, and for him sociology had both to &quot;explain&quot; and to &quot;understand&quot; things – a daring combination, but successful in the eyes of many sociologists.

<doc id="709219" wikidata="Q882921" url="?curid=709219" title="Mike Sullivan (Wyoming politician)">
<text>Michael John Sullivan (born September 22, 1939) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 29th Governor of Wyoming from 1987 to 1995, and United States Ambassador to Ireland from 1998 to 2001, as a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to his gubernatorial tenure he was active in local politics in Natrona County, Wyoming.

Sullivan was born in Omaha, Nebraska, as a member of a family active in the Wyoming Legislature and grew up in Douglas, Wyoming. He was educated at the University of Wyoming. He practiced law and became involved in local politics with his service on the Natrona County Memorial Hospital board. Sullivan won in the 1986 and 1990 gubernatorial elections despite being outspent both times by Pete Simpson and Mary Mead.

During Sullivan&#x27;s gubernatorial tenure he became the first governor in Wyoming&#x27;s history to have his veto overturned, appointed three people to the Wyoming Supreme Court, oversaw Wyoming&#x27;s only criminal execution after &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, led the passage of a holiday in Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s honor, and chaired the Western Governors Association. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the United States Senate in the 1994 election before being appointed as the ambassador to Ireland by President Bill Clinton. He was the first governor to endorse Clinton during the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries and co-chaired his campaign in Wyoming during both presidential campaigns.

==Early life==
Michael John Sullivan was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on September 22, 1939, to Margaret Elizabeth Sullivan and Joseph Sullivan Jr., who was elected as Converse County attorney as a member of the Democratic Party and served as the president of the Wyoming State Bar. His brother, Dan Sullivan, served in the Wyoming Senate as a member of the Republican Party. His uncle, John Sullivan, and grandfather, Joseph Sullivan, served in the Wyoming House of Representatives. Sullivan was raised in Douglas, Wyoming, as a member of the Catholic Church.

Sullivan graduated from Converse County High School, where he served as class president and was the salutatorian of the class of 1957. In 1961, he graduated from the University of Wyoming with a bachelor of science in petroleum engineering and later with a Juris Doctor in 1964. In college, he was a member of the student senate. In 1961, he married Jane Metzler, with whom he had three children. From 1968 to 1986, he worked as an attorney for Brown, Drew, Massey &amp; Sullivan. He became a member of Delta Theta Phi in 1986.

==Career==
===Local politics===

In 1974, Sullivan was speculated as a possible nominee for Wyoming&#x27;s Attorney General by Governor-elect Edgar Herschler. During the 1970s, he served as president of the Natrona County Bar Association.

On January 27, 1976, Natrona County commissioners appointed Sullivan to the Building Appeal Board of Casper, Wyoming and the Natrona County Memorial Hospital board to fill the vacancy created by Bill Barton&#x27;s death. On February 17, the board unanimously approved a resolution giving Sullivan another term. During his tenure on the hospital board, he served as its treasurer and president. On December 11, 1986, he resigned from the hospital board following his election as governor.

===Governor===
====1986 election====

On January 16, 1986, Sullivan said that he was considering running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Former state Senator Bill Rector stated, &quot;I think Mike [Sullivan] would be a good candidate,&quot; after he dropped out of the Democratic gubernatorial primary. On March 20, Sullivan announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination at a press conference inside his house in Casper.

Teno Roncalio, who served in the United States House of Representatives, supported Sullivan and was selected as an honorary chairman of his campaign. Charles Brown, the director of KTWO-TV News, was selected as Sullivan&#x27;s campaign manager. On June 6, Sullivan filed to run for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. In the primary, Sullivan defeated Pat McGuire, Keith Goodenough, and Al Hamburg after spending $102,219.

On September 3, Bryan Sharratt, a former candidate in the 1982 Senate election, was selected as Sullivan&#x27;s campaign manager after Brown was assigned as the campaign&#x27;s media coordinator. In the general election, Sullivan defeated Republican nominee Pete Simpson after spending $192,917. Sullivan did not expect to win the election, according to Joseph Meyer. He was the first person from Casper to win Wyoming&#x27;s gubernatorial election since Bryant Butler Brooks in 1906.

====1990 election====
Citizens for Sullivan was registered on December 7, 1989, by Marilyn Lyle and Mark Gifford, who met with Sullivan to allow campaign donations to be sent to him, although he stated that it was not a campaign announcement. He waited until after the passage of the 1991–1992 budget as he stated that doing so before its passage would politicize the budget. He announced his reelection campaign on May 1, 1990. He defeated Ron Clingman in the Democratic primary after raising $142,559 and spending $115,966. Richard Lindsey was his campaign manager.

Mark Hughes, chair of the Wyoming Republican Party, blamed their defeat in the 1986 election on the primary which had seven candidates that divided the loyalty of the party. The Republican&#x27;s central committee held a meeting in 1989 to reduce the size of the primary field of candidates. Mary Mead won the Republican nomination after every candidate except for Nyla Murphy dropped out and endorsed her. Sullivan participated in five debates against Mead. He defeated Mead and Sullivan&#x27;s margin of victory was the largest for any governor in Wyoming&#x27;s history at the time. Mead spent $702,105 during the campaign while Sullivan spent $310,030.

====Tenure====
In 1991, Sullivan vetoed legislation allowing tax exemptions for wildcat oil drilling, which was overridden due to the Republicans gaining support from two Democratic members in the state senate and Eli Bebout in the state house. This was the first time in Wyoming&#x27;s statehood that a governor&#x27;s veto was overridden by the Wyoming Legislature. He criticized the leadership of the Republicans in the state house in 1988 for denying committee chair positions to Representatives Murphy and Mary Odde due to them not supporting an attempt to override one of Sullivan&#x27;s vetoes. The Republicans gained a veto-proof majority in the state legislature following the 1992 elections. Sullivan vetoed multiple pieces of legislation altering the appointment to fill vacancies in partisan offices as to require the governor to choose from three people selected by the central committee of the party that held the office. However, the Republicans successfully overrode his veto in 1993.

Sullivan&#x27;s first judicial appointment was his appointment of Nicholas Kalokathis to the First Judicial District in 1987. He made three appointments to the Wyoming Supreme Court, appointing Michael Golden to replace Charles Stuart Brown in 1988, William A. Taylor to replace Steve Urbigkit in 1992, and Larry Lehman to replace G. Joseph Cardine in 1994. He attempted to reappoint Carrol Orrison to the Wyoming Board of Equalization, but the state senate rejected his nomination. He appointed Joseph Meyer as Attorney General in 1987. He appealed to President Bill Clinton to appoint a Wyomingite to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in 1993.

Sullivan was selected to replace Dave Freudenthal as the chairman of the Economic Development and Stabilization Board on January 21, 1987. He led an eighteen-member delegation to Australia and Taiwan for sixteen days in 1987 with the goal of increasing agricultural, business, and tourism investments with Wyoming, and he established a trade office in the Taipei World Trade Center in 1989. He was elected to the National Governors Association Executive Committee in 1988. He was the vice-chair of the Western Governors Association and succeeded South Dakota Governor George S. Mickelson as chair in 1991. He was offered the presidency of the Council of State Governments for 1992, but declined, stating, &quot;I have enough outside activities&quot;.
Sullivan remained neutral during the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries until he endorsed Michael Dukakis on May 6, 1988. He endorsed Clinton during the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, the first governor to do so, and co-chaired Clinton&#x27;s campaign in Wyoming with Secretary of State Kathy Karpan. He served as a superdelegate to the 1988 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions and chair of the Wyoming delegation to both conventions. Sullivan endorsed Sharratt in the 1988 election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Wyoming&#x27;s at-large congressional district and John Vinich in the 1989 special election. Sullivan supported Dick Cheney&#x27;s appointment as United States Secretary of Defense. A Wyoming chapter of the Democratic Leadership Council was organized in 1991, with Sullivan and Karpan as co-chairs.

When mobile phone service was provided to Wyoming, Sullivan performed some of the first mobile phone calls in the state when he called Mayor of Casper Judi Laird and received a call from Gerald Ford.

===United States Senate campaign===
On April 11, 1994, Sullivan announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate election to succeed Republican Senator Malcolm Wallop. He filed to run on June 1. During the election, the campaign of Republican nominee Craig L. Thomas said in a fundraising letter that President Clinton had pledged $1 million to aid Sullivan&#x27;s campaign. Sullivan and White House spokesman Joshua Silverman stated that no pledge was made.

On July 20, Sullivan returned a $1,350 contribution from U.S. Representative Lawrence J. Smith, made at a June 17 fundraiser in Florida held by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, after Thomas&#x27;s campaign sent copies of the donation and news reports of Smith&#x27;s misuse of campaign funds to Sullivan. Sullivan faced no opposition in the Democratic primary and was defeated by Thomas in the general election.

===Ambassador===
During the 1992 presidential election, Sullivan and Karpan published a letter calling for Wyoming voters to support Clinton and criticizing President George H. W. Bush for his negative campaign tactics, such as the Willie Horton ad during the 1988 presidential election. He supported Clinton&#x27;s reelection campaign in the 1996 election and served as the co-chair of Clinton&#x27;s Wyoming committee alongside Bob Schuster. He was considered for ambassadorships by the Clinton administration. He was considered as a candidate for Ambassador to the Holy See to replace Raymond Flynn, but that position was given to Lindy Boggs instead.

On June 10, 1998, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Sullivan was the leading candidate for Ambassador to Ireland, and Sullivan stated that he had been contacted by White House officials. On August 28, President Clinton announced his nomination of Sullivan for the ambassadorship. He was the tenth resident of Wyoming to receive a high-level diplomatic position. His nomination was approved by the United States Senate on October 21 and he was sworn in at a ceremony in the Indian Treaty Room on December 8. On January 21, 1999, Sullivan presented his credentials to President of Ireland Mary McAleese. Members of the Wyoming Legislature sent him a legislative resolution honoring his appointment. He served until June 20, 2001.

==Later life==
It was speculated by Del Tinsley, publisher of Wyoming Livestock Roundup, that President George W. Bush would appoint Sullivan as Secretary of the Interior, but Bush appointed Gale Norton. In 2002, he was appointed chairman of the University of Wyoming&#x27;s Institute for Environment and Natural Resources board of directors, replacing John Turner, who had resigned to become assistant secretary of state for the State Department Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. In 2007, Sullivan was named as a distinguished alumnus of the University of Wyoming.

During the 2002 Wyoming gubernatorial election, Sullivan endorsed Democratic nominee Dave Freudenthal. During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, he supported Hillary Clinton for the nomination and was appointed onto a Wyoming steering committee for her campaign on February 28, 2008. He registered as a Republican in order to vote for Liz Cheney in the Republican primary in the 2022 election.

==Political positions==
===Economics and development===
In 1986, Sullivan called for the Reagan administration to be open to an oil import tax as a stable oil price would help maintain the economies of energy producing states and Native American tribes. In 1987, Sullivan stated that &quot;we didn&#x27;t get any great support or reason for optimism&quot; about the possibility of an oil import tax being implemented by Reagan after attending the National Governors Association. He opposed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), stating that it would negatively impact Wyoming&#x27;s energy industry. The National Governors Association voted thirty to five in favor of giving its support to CUSFTA, with Sullivan against. He supported the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In 1986, Sullivan called for the Interstate Commerce Commission to prevent the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad from discontinuing its railroad line to Riverton, Wyoming, as it would be &quot;contrary to the interests of Fremont County and the state of Wyoming.&quot; Sullivan sought for the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider inside Wyoming. Sullivan asked W. Graham Claytor Jr. to restore Amtrak&#x27;s passenger service through Wyoming after the line was altered to travel through Colorado instead in 1983. Sullivan opposed the western United States being used for nuclear waste storage.

In 1992, Sullivan was given an A grade of 75 from the Cato Institute, ahead of every other state governor and only behind Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld&#x27;s score of 85, due to his handling of Wyoming&#x27;s energy industry growth.

===Foreign policy===
On March 8, 1986, Sullivan gave the keynote address at the Natrona County Democratic convention. During his speech he criticized the Reagan administration as it &quot;waffled and rationalized&quot; over allegations of fraud committed by President Ferdinand Marcos during the 1986 Philippine presidential election. He also criticized the administration for its support of military aid to the Contras during the Nicaraguan Revolution. In October, he stated that he would accept the removal of missiles from Wyoming as a part of an arms agreement with the Soviet Union as &quot;if we can secure world peace, we can&#x27;t be concerned about what effect it may have on our short-term economic development prospects.&quot; He signed a legislative resolution supporting Operation Desert Storm.

===Government===
During the reapportionment process before the 1992 Wyoming Senate election, Sullivan supported the creation of single-member districts, but the state legislature approved legislation which reduced the state house from 64 members to 62 members, created 16 single-member and 23 two-member House districts, and had the entirety of the state senate elected from single-member districts. On February 17, 1992, Sullivan vetoed the legislation. On February 18, the state legislature failed to overturn his veto with all 42 Republican members of the House and Senate voting to override and all 22 Democratic members voting against, causing the attempted overturning to fall one vote short. Sullivan signed a new redistricting plan on February 21, which had all thirty members of the state senate elected from single-member districts and reduced the state house from sixty-four to sixty members all elected from single-member districts.

During Sullivan&#x27;s state-of-the-state speech in January 1987, he supported the idea of reorganizing the Department of Health and Social Service into four different departments, but when the legislation was introduced by Senator Win Hickey it died in committee. He and fellow governors Clifford Hansen, Stanley K. Hathaway, and Jim Geringer opposed ballot proposals during the 1996 election that would institute term limits in the state legislature.

===Social===
Sullivan is opposed to abortion. In 1977, the Natrona County Memorial Hospital board voted two to two, with Sullivan against, on whether to allow non-therapeutic abortions in the hospital. Bill Muller broke the tie by voting to allow non-therapeutic abortions. Brown stated that Sullivan was against a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortions and that he would not support legislation that would prevent abortions. The National Organization for Women rated him as anti-choice during the 1990 election. During the 1994 elections he opposed a ballot initiative that would ban abortion in Wyoming, except to save the mother&#x27;s life or in the cases of rape or incest, and would punish physicians who perform abortions with up to fourteen years in prison.

On September 16, 1986, Sullivan stated that he would not require general drug testing of state employees. He opposed legislation that would prohibit children with AIDS from attending school and said that experts should make decisions about individual cases. In 1987, he vetoed legislation which would have repealed a 1985 law requiring rubella tests and Rh factor tests for marriage licenses. Alan Simpson, Sullivan, Thomas, and Wallop questioned the effects of asbestos with Sullivan also stating that the cost of removing asbestos from schools would be expensive.

Sullivan supports capital punishment although he stated that he would not oppose an attempt to end executions by the state legislature. In 1992, he stated that he would not grant clemency to convicted murderer Mark Hopkinson despite the American Civil Liberties Union, Wyoming Public Defender Leonard Munker, Gerry Spence, who led the prosecution against Hopkinson, and Marjorie Coggeshall, a relative of the murder victims, asking for clemency. He stated that he would talk to Mother Teresa about the execution, but only if she started the discussion. Hopkinson was executed on January 22, 1992, becoming the first person executed in Wyoming since 1965, and the only person executed in Wyoming after Furman v. Georgia.

The Natrona County Memorial Hospital board voted four to zero, with Sullivan voting in favor, to prohibit the sale of tobacco in the hospital in 1977. He supported and signed legislation raising the drinking age in Wyoming from nineteen to twenty-one, making Wyoming the last state to raise its drinking age to twenty-one. He stated that legislation by House Minority Leader H. L. Jensen to lower the drinking age from twenty-one to nineteen was &quot;the silliest thing I&#x27;ve heard in a long time&quot;. He opposed the legalization of gambling.

Sullivan supported legislation creating a holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. while opposing attempts to name the holiday Wyoming&#x27;s Day of Equal Rights. He stated that it was &quot;profound embarrassment to our state&quot; when the legislation failed to pass. He signed an executive order in 1989, declaring that Martin Luther King Jr. Equality Day would be on January 15, 1990. Wyoming was the forty-seventh state to recognize a holiday in honor of King.

===Taxation===
Sullivan criticized the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act for &quot;cutting and carving without recognition of needs and the merits of programs&quot;. Brown stated that Sullivan would not support increasing taxes. In 1987, the Wyoming Legislature voted in favor of decreasing the coal tax which would decrease revenue by up to $15 million by the 1990s. Sullivan opposed the legislation and wrote a letter to legislators voicing his opposition. He proposed increasing taxation on alcohol, from 2¢ to 20¢ per gallon, and cigarettes, from 8¢ to 28¢ per pack, in 1987.

Wyoming Senate Democratic Minority Whip John Fanos criticized Sullivan in 1992 for not having the leadership abilities to stop budget cuts and encourage tax increases. On March 15, 1994, Sullivan signed the 1995–1996 budget into law, but used his line-item veto against thirteen parts of the legislation. However, the state House and Senate voted to overturn his vetoes with all Republican members voting in favor of overriding and all Democratic members voting against.

Sullivan and Wyoming&#x27;s congressional delegation wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to criticize Citizens for Tax Justice&#x27;s report stating that Wyoming was among the ten states with the worst tax structure.

<text>Frank Charles Shorter (born October 31, 1947) is an American former long-distance runner who won the gold medal in the marathon at the 1972 Summer Olympics and the silver medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics. His Olympic success, along with the achievements of other American runners, is credited with igniting the running boom in the United States during the 1970s.

== Early life and education ==
Frank Shorter was born in Munich, Germany, where his father, physician Samuel S. Shorter, served in the U.S. Army. He grew up in Middletown, New York, where a street was named in his honor (Frank Shorter Way). Frank Shorter Way was formerly part of the Orange Classic 10K course route, which Shorter won in its inaugural race in 1981. After earning his high school diploma from the Mount Hermon School in Gill, Massachusetts, in 1965, Shorter graduated from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, with a Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) in 1969, and the University of Florida College of Law in Gainesville, Florida, with a Juris Doctor degree (J.D.) in 1974.

In the October 2011 issue of &quot;Runner&#x27;s World,&quot; an article by John Brant detailed the traumatic household life Frank and his siblings suffered at the hands of his extremely abusive father and the buckle end of his belt. With the publication of the &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; article, Shorter began to elaborate on stopping similar cycles of violence in more detail and in public.

== Running career ==
Shorter first achieved distinction by winning the 1969 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) six mile run title during his senior year at Yale. He won his first U.S. national titles in 1970 in the three mile and six mile events. He also was the U.S. national six mile/10,000 meter champion in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1977.

After graduating from Yale, Shorter chose to pursue a Doctor of Medicine degree at the University of New Mexico. However, he dropped out after six weeks after classes began to impact his training regime. Soon, he moved to Florida to study for a Juris Doctor degree at the University of Florida in Gainesville because of the excellence of the environment and the opportunity to train with Jack Bacheler as members of the Florida Track Club (FTC), founded by Jimmy Carnes, then the head coach of the Florida Gators track and field team. Bacheler was regarded as America&#x27;s best distance runner, having qualified for the finals of the 5,000-meter race at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The FTC&#x27;s core nucleus of Shorter, Bacheler and Jeff Galloway qualified for the 1972 Olympics and their success made Gainesville the Mecca of distance running on the East Coast in the early 1970s.

Shorter won the U.S. national cross-country championships four times (1970–1973). He was the U.S. Olympic Trials champion in both the 10,000-meter run and the marathon in both 1972 and 1976. He also won both the 10,000-meter run and the marathon at the 1971 Pan American Games. Shorter was a four-time winner of the Fukuoka Marathon (1971–1974), generally recognized as the most prestigious marathon in the world at that time and held on a very fast course. His career best of 2:10:30 was set at that race on December 3, 1972. Several months later, on March 18, 1973, Shorter won the elite Lake Biwa Marathon in 2:12:03. He won the prestigious 7-mile Falmouth Road Race on Cape Cod in 1975 and 1976 and Atlanta&#x27;s 10-kilometer Peachtree Road Race in 1977.

Shorter achieved his greatest recognition in the marathon, and he is the only American athlete to win two medals in the Olympic marathon. At the Munich Games—which coincidentally is Shorter&#x27;s place of birth— he finished fifth in the 10,000-meter final, breaking the American record for the event that he had established in his qualifying heat. A few days later, he won the gold medal in the marathon. This ultimate achievement was marred by an imposter, West German student Norbert Sudhaus, who ran into Olympic Stadium ahead of Shorter. Shorter was not bothered by the silence from the crowd who had been duped into thinking that he was running for the silver medal. Shorter was confident that he was going to win the gold medal because he knew that no competing runner had passed him. He received the James E. Sullivan Award afterwards as the top amateur athlete in the United States. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Shorter dropped out of the 10,000 meters in order to concentrate exclusively on the marathon, winning the silver medal in the marathon and finishing behind previously unheralded Waldemar Cierpinski of East Germany. Cierpinski was later implicated as a part of the state-sponsored doping program by East German track and field research files uncovered by Werner Franke at the Stasi headquarters in Leipzig in the late 1990s. There were suspicions about other East German athletes during the Montreal Olympics, including the East German women&#x27;s swimming team led by Kornelia Ender; the East German women won eleven of the thirteen events.

From 2000 to 2003, Shorter was the chairman of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, a body that he helped to establish.

Shorter was featured as a prominent character, played by Jeremy Sisto, in the 1998 film &quot;Without Limits.&quot; The film follows the life of Shorter&#x27;s contemporary, training partner, Olympic teammate and sometime rival, Steve Prefontaine. Shorter was the next to last person to see Prefontaine alive before he died in an automobile accident.

Shorter was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1984, the USA National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1989, and the National Distance Running Hall of Fame in 1998.

Previously a long-time resident of Boulder, Colorado, Shorter co-founded the Bolder Boulder in 1979. The annual 10k race is a popular Memorial Day event, which culminates with a tribute to U.S. Armed Forces at Folsom Field at the University of Colorado. A life-size bronze statue of Shorter stands outside the stadium.

In 2021, Shorter and his wife, Michelle Cox, moved to Falmouth, Massachusetts.

<text>The Security Service of Ukraine ( ; abbreviated as SBU or SSU) is the main internal security agency of the Ukrainian government. Its main duties include counter-intelligence activity and combating organized crime and terrorism. The Constitution of Ukraine defines the SBU as a military formation, and its staff are considered military personnel with ranks. It is subordinated directly under the authority of the president of Ukraine. The SBU also operates its own special forces unit, the Alpha Group.

The SBU was created after the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in 1991. The agency was viewed negatively by the Ukrainian public for much of its history, as it was widely regarded as corrupt and was best known for arresting and intimidating political dissidents. After the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, the SBU went through a restructuring with the transition to the new government, because of its corruption and possible infiltration by intelligence agencies of Russia.

The SBU has since been involved in operations against Russia, pro-Russian separatists in Donbas and other Russian sympathizers after the start of the war in Donbas and the wider Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Duties and responsibilities==
The Security Service of Ukraine is vested, within its competence defined by law, with the protection of national sovereignty, constitutional order, territorial integrity, economical, scientific, technical, and defense potential of Ukraine, legal interests of the state, and civil rights, from intelligence and subversion activities of foreign special services and from unlawful interference attempted by certain organizations, groups and individuals, as well with ensuring the protection of state secrets.

Other duties include combating crimes that endanger the peace and security of mankind, terrorism, corruption, and organized criminal activities in the sphere of management and economy, as well as other unlawful acts immediately threatening Ukraine&#x27;s vital interests.

==Organization==
The general structure and operational methods of SBU appear to be very similar to that of its predecessor (KGB of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) with exception of Ukrainian Border Guards and department responsible for security of high-rank state officials. Both of them became independent institutions. However, the SBU keeps under its control special operation Alpha units with bases in every Ukrainian province. According to British political expert Taras Kuzio the organizational structure of SBU remains bloated in size compared to its predecessor, the Soviet Ukrainian KGB, with the total number of active officers being as high as 30,000 personnel. It is six times larger than the British domestic MI5 and external MI6 combined.

===Structure===
* Central Apparatus (consists of some 25 departments)
** Main Directorate on Corruption and Organized Crime Counteraction
* Regional Departments of the SBU (26 departments)
* Special Department
* Anti-Terrorist Center cooperates with numerous ministries and other state agencies such as the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Emergencies, State Border Guard Service, and others.
* Educational Institutions
** Institute in preparation of Service Personnel at the National Law Academy of Yaroslav the Wise 
** Other educational institutions
* Military Counter-intelligence
* State Archives of the SBU
* Special Group &quot;Alpha&quot;

==History==
===Ukrainian security services in Soviet era ===
On January 14, 1918, the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic founded its Security Services.

In May 1918 the Department of the State Guard of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Ukrainian State started to form a new intelligence service. This was a much more effective agency than its predecessor due to the incorporation of former employees of Okhrana (the secret police force of the Russian Empire). After the fall of the Ukrainian State and the return of power of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UNR) in December 1918, the new UNR authorities destroyed virtually all of the state infrastructure of the Ukrainian State. Therefore, the new secret services founded in January 1919 (with two divisions – domestic and foreign) had to start practically from scratch. It never became as well-led, nor as successful, as its forerunner, the security services of the Ukrainian State. The security services of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on the other hand were well-organized. The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic were formed in March 1919 as the Field Gendarmerie of the Ukrainian Galician Army (it also served as military police). There was no cooperation between the security services of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

In 1924, former (April–July 1919) head of intelligence of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic Mykola Chebotarov started intelligence work on his own initiative for the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic government in exile on the territory of the Ukrainian SSR.
The All-Ukrainian Cheka was formed on December 3, 1918, in Kursk on the initiative from Yakov Sverdlov and Lenin&#x27;s orders. The commission was formed on the decree of the Provisional Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Government of Ukraine and later adopted on May 30, 1919, by the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. To support the Soviet government in Ukraine, in Moscow was formed a corps of special assignment with 24,500 soldiers as part of the All-Ukrainian Cheka. In spring 1919, there was created the Council in fight against counterrevolution and consisted of Adolph Joffe, Stanislav Kosior, and Martin Latsis. In its early years the security agency fought against the &quot;kulak-nationalistic banditry&quot; (peasants who resisted having their land confiscated and being forced into collective farms). On August 19, 1920, the All-Ukrainian Cheka arrested all members of the All-Ukrainian Conference of Mensheviks after accusing them of counterrevolutionary activity. On December 10, 1934, the State Political Directorate of Ukraine was dissolved, becoming part of the NKVD of Ukraine.

===1990s–2005===
The SBU originated from the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic&#x27;s Branch of the Soviet KGB, keeping the majority of its 1990s personnel. It was created in September 1991 following the August 1991 independence of Ukraine. The last Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic&#x27;s Branch head Colonel-General Nikolai Golushko stayed on as chairman of the newly formed Security Service of Ukraine for four months before moving to Russia. (Golushko headed the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service in 1993 and 1994.)

Since 1992, the agency has been competing in intelligence functions with the intelligence branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Despite this, a former Military Intelligence Chief and career GRU technological espionage expert, Ihor Smeshko, served as an SBU chief until 2005.

According to Taras Kuzio during the 1990s in some regions of Ukraine (Donetsk) the SBU teamed up with local criminals taking part in privatization of state property (so-called &quot;prykhvatizatsiya&quot;) ignoring its operational objectives and sky-rocketing level of local violence. A notorious incident took place in December 1995 in Western Ukraine when a local citizen Yuriy Mozola was arrested by SBU agents, interrogated and brutally tortured for three days. He refused to confess in trumped up murder charges and died in SBU custody. Later it turned out that the real killer was Anatoly Onoprienko. He was arrested the next year.

Reports of SBU involvement in arms sales abroad began appearing regularly in the early 2000s. Ukrainian authorities have acknowledged these sales and arrested some alleged participants.

In 2004, the SBU&#x27;s Intelligence Department was reorganized into an independent agency called Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. It is responsible for all kinds of intelligence as well as for external security. As of 2004, the exact functions of the new service, and respective responsibilities of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine were not regulated yet. On November 7, 2005, the President of Ukraine created the Ukraine State Service of special communications and protection of information, also known as Derzhspetszvyazok (StateSpecCom) in place of one of the departments of SBU and making it an autonomous agency. The SBU subsumed the Directorate of State Protection of Ukraine (), the personal protection agency for the most senior government officials, which was the former Ninth Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB.

The SBU&#x27;s State Directorate of Personal Protection is known for its former Major Mykola Mel&#x27;nychenko, the communications protection agent in President Leonid Kuchma&#x27;s bodyguard team. Mel&#x27;nychenko was the central figure of the Cassette Scandal (2000)—one of the main events in Ukraine&#x27;s post-independence history. SBU became involved in the case when Mel&#x27;nychenko accused Leonid Derkach, SBU Chief at the time, of several crimes, e.g., of clandestine relations with Russian mafia leader Semyon Mogilevich. However, the UDO was subsumed into the SBU after the scandal, so Mel&#x27;nychenko himself has never been an SBU agent.

Later, the SBU played a significant role in the investigation of the Georgiy Gongadze murder case, the crime that caused the Cassette Scandal itself.

In 2004, General Valeriy Kravchenko, SBU&#x27;s intelligence representative in Germany, publicly accused his agency of political involvement, including overseas spying on Ukrainian opposition politicians and German TV journalists. He was fired without returning home. After a half-year of hiding in Germany, Kravchenko returned to Ukraine and surrendered in October 2004 (an investigation is underway).

Later, the agency commanders became involved in the scandal around the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko—a main candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Yushchenko felt unwell soon after supper with SBU Chief Ihor Smeshko, at the home of Smeshko&#x27;s first deputy. However, neither the politician himself nor the investigators have ever directly accused these officers. The Personal Protection department has been officially responsible for Yushchenko&#x27;s personal security since he became a candidate. During the Orange Revolution, several SBU veterans and cadets publicly supported him as president-elect, while the agency as a whole remained neutral.

===2005–2010===
In 2005, soon after the elections, sacked SBU Chief Smeshko and other intelligence agents stated their own version of the revolution&#x27;s events. They claimed to have prevented militsiya from violently suppressing the protests, contradicting the orders of President Kuchma and threatening &quot;militsiya&quot; with armed involvement of SBU&#x27;s special forces units. This story was first described by the American journalist C.J. Chivers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and has never been supported with documents or legally.

An episode of human rights abuse by SBU happened during the case of serial killer Anatoly Onoprienko. Yuriy Mozola, an initial suspect in the investigation, died in SBU custody in Lviv as a result of torture. Several agents were convicted in the case. The SBU remains a political controversial subject in Ukrainian politics.
===2010–2014===
The former Security Service of Ukraine Head Valeriy Khoroshkovsky was involved in several controversies during his tenure. The rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv Borys Gudziak heavily criticized a visit from the SBU, forcing Khoroshkovskiy to apologize. Later the head of the Kyiv Bureau of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, Nico Lange, was detained for a short while and released only after several high-ranking officials from the &quot;German Chancellery&quot; vouched for him. The Security Service described the incident as a misunderstanding. Khoroshkovskiy, as the Chairman of the SBU, eliminated the main competition of Ukrainian TV-giant Inter, officially owned by his wife Olena Khoroshkovskiy, in the face of TVi and Channel 5. In July 2010, Konrad Schuller of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; wrote that Khoroshkovskiy had connections with RosUkrEnergo. The most important source of Khoroshkovskiy&#x27;s came from RosUkrEnergo. The President&#x27;s spokesperson, Hanna Herman, in an interview with this newspaper, did not dispute that Dmytro Firtash was one of the sponsors of the Presidential Party of Regions, with the help of which Khoroshkovskiy was appointed to the position of the State Security chairman. Khoroshkovskiy denied any connections to RosUkrEnergo. However it is a fact that Firtash possesses certain privileges in Inter. Schuller also stated that the SBU acts in direct association with RosUkrEnergo, arresting their main opponents (see RosUkrEnergo) to recover their invested money in the recent presidential campaign. Khoroshkovskiy having declined to give an interview to &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, Schuller posted a quote from one of his other interviews:

When Minister of Finance Fedir Yaroshenko resigned on January 18, 2012, Khoroshkovsky replaced him in the post on the same day. Khoroshkovsky is also the owner of U.A. Inter Media Group which owns major shares in various Ukrainian TV channels including Inter TV. 238 members of the Verkhovna Rada voted for Khoroshkovsky, however the head of the parliamentary committee for the National Security and Defense Anatoliy Hrytsenko stated that the committee accepted the decision to recommend Verkhovna Rada to deny the candidature of Khoroshkovskiy on the post of the chairman of Security Service of Ukraine.

Khoroshkovskiy said the SBU&#x27;s main duty was to protect the president rather than the interests of Ukraine. On July 26, 2010, it arrested an internet blogger, producing a warrant for his arrest the next day. SBU accused the blogger of threatening the President of Ukraine, citing his comment &quot;May thunder strike Yanukovych!&quot;; he was released after a short discussion. However, SBU showed a rather passive reaction to the statements of the Russian state official who claimed that Crimea and Sevastopol belong to the Russian Federation. Protest group FEMEN said that after the early 2010 election of President Viktor Yanukovych the SBU attempted to intimidate the FEMEN activists.

On May 22, 2012, Volodymyr Rokytskyi, Deputy Head of the SBU, was photographed in public wearing a $32,000 luxury wristwatch despite the fact that its price amounts to his yearly official income. The instance happened at a joint Ukrainian-American event dedicated to fighting the drug trade.

The SBU uncovered seven spies and 16 special service agents in 2009. A large number of arrests and searches occurred in 2011.

===2014–2022===

In February 2014, numerous documents, hard drives, and flash drives, including data on over 22,000 officers and informants, were stolen or destroyed in a raid on the SBU allegedly ordered by President Viktor Yanukovych.

Late February 2014 opposition MP Hennadiy Moskal released papers that showed the SBU had allegedly infiltrated the late 2013 – February 2014 anti-government Euromaidan protest. According to BBC Ukraine analyst Olexiy Solohubenko, many tactics discussed in the paper had indeed been performed.

After the overthrow of Yanukovich in the Revolution of Dignity the new SBU head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko claimed to have found his new office building empty, saying &quot;the agency&#x27;s former leadership had all fled to Russia or Crimea. There were no operative files, no weapons. Institutionally, the place was totally destroyed&quot;. Nalyvaichenko also claimed that at that time the agency was heavily infiltrated by Russian spies. Indeed, Nalyvaichenko predecessor Oleksandr Yakymenko with about 15 former SBU top officials surfaced in Russia a few days later. Allegedly in the months following the Revolution of Dignity thousands of Ukrainian spies switched sides and began reporting to Russia during the 2014 Crimean crisis and the pro-Russian unrest in east and south Ukraine. At the end of 2014 235 SBU agents, including the former counterintelligence chief and his cousin, and hundreds of other operatives had been arrested and 25 high treason probes against Yanukovych-era SBU officials had been launched; also all regional directors had been changed, as well as half of their deputies. In July 2015 Nalyvaichenko claimed &quot;There&#x27;s no longer a total infiltration of Russian agents. The danger is no longer widespread&quot;. The arrested agents were replaced by new recruits from western Ukraine, many of them in their early twenties. To test loyalty, all SBU agents are subjected to recurrent interrogations and lie detector tests.

In June 2015, the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; reported that a deputy chief of the SBU, Vitaly Malikov, had supported events leading to the annexation of Crimea. According to February 2016 official figures of the Ukrainian parliamentary Committee on National Security, after Russia&#x27;s annexation 10% of SBU personnel left Crimea. According to the SBU itself (in November 2017) 13% did so.

In 2016, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reported that the SBU operates secret detention facilities where civilians are held incommunicado being subjected to improper treatment and torture.

In 2017, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) expressed concerns about a situation with &quot;freedom of opinion and expression&quot; in Ukraine which facing &quot;mounting challenges&quot;. According to the UN reports the SBU is taking advantage of broad interpretation and application of Ukrainian Criminal Code against independent Ukrainian journalists, bloggers, and media activists. According to reports of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, the SBU personnel is responsible for multiple cases of human rights abuses including sexual violence and torture.

A new fifth directorate of SBU was created in 2015 to act as a saboteur force. It was associated with several assassinations of prominent pro-Russian commanders in Donbas: Alexander Zakharchenko, Mikhail Tolstykh and Arsen Pavlov.

On December 21, 2017, two Ukrainian civil servants were arrested by the SBU for spying on behalf of Russia, one of them being an SBU employee while the other, Stanislav Yezhov, worked for various cabinet ministers.

In late 2018, the SBU carried out raids across the country targeting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) churches and priests.

On July 8, 2019, the SBU announced that they conducted a raid into areas held by the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic to apprehend Vladimir Borysovich Tsemakh, who was head of the air defense in Snizhne and a &#x27;person of interest&#x27; when a Buk missile launcher was used to shoot down MH17. The SBU mentioned that he&#x27;s a witness to the incident.

On April 14, 2020, the SBU announced the arrest of Lt. General , who was recruited in 2014 by the FSB during a Russian-Ukrainian anti-terrorist working group under the command of Colonel . He was known to head the anti-terrorist division who had played a prominent role in negotiating ceasefires and prisoner exchanges with Russia-backed militants in Eastern Ukraine. He had planned the future assassination of Adam Osmayev, a Chechen in the International Peacekeeping Battalion named after Dzhokhar Dudayev which is defending Ukraine against Russia aggression.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

With the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the SBU started to conduct extensive counter-espionage against Russian intelligence services. The SBU captured fifth-columnists, Russian sympathizers, collaborators, spies and infiltrators. The SBU, with help of the American NSA and CIA, also broke through the Russian encrypted cellphone services, intercepting phone calls to find valuable targets or other useful intelligence. Several Russian generals died due to the intercepted calls. They also published many supposed intercepted phone calls on their website, showing morale issues or admissions of war crimes by Russian troops.

On March 5, 2022, SBU agents shot and killed Denis Kireev, a member of Ukraine&#x27;s negotiating delegation during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, while he was being arrested. According to the SBU, Kireev was suspected of treason and was claimed to have clear evidence of him working for the enemy. However in August 18, later the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine (GUR) disclosed the information that he was their agent and that he &quot;died while performing special tasks&quot; for the GUR.

On April 12, 2022, the SBU announced they had arrested Viktor Medvedchuk, an ally of Vladimir Putin, in what Bakanov called a &quot;a lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation&quot;; a treason case was opened against Medvedchuk the previous year and in February, and authorities said that Medvedchuk that escaped from house arrest.

July 17, 2022, Head of the SBU Ivan Bakanov was dismissed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While a long-time associate and personal friend of Zelenskyy, Bakanov was accused of allowing treason and collaboration of SBU agents with Russia, and failing to uproot them. Vasyl Malyuk, the first Deputy Head of the SBU, was appointed as acting Head of the SBU.

According to &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; and the UNIAN, the October 2022 Crimean Bridge explosion was carried out by the SBU.

On August 7, 2023, Ukrainian Security Service has arrested a woman in relation to an attempt to assassinate President Zelenskyy. The unnamed woman was accused of supplying information for a Russian air strike.

On August 12, 2024, SBU alleged that Russia was attempting to falsely accuse Kyiv&#x27;s military of committing war crimes, as Ukraine advanced with a ground incursion into Russia&#x27;s Kursk region. Meanwhile, Russian state media reported that Alexei Smirnov, accused Ukrainian forces of using chemical weapons. Smirnov also stated that Ukraine had seized control of 28 settlements in the region.

==== Assassinations ====
SBU was connected to a number of targeted attacks on Russian military personnel and pro-Kremlin figures. Ukraine said it was behind the killing of a senior Russian naval officer in a car in Crimea. SBU said it was also responsible for the killing of a high-ranking officer in the GRU military intelligence service, who was assassinated outside his house in a village in the Moscow region.

Apart from military figures, Ukraine has targeted prominent Russian pro-war propagandists, including Darya Dugina, daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue Aleksandr Dugin, who was killed in 2023 when a car bomb smashed her Toyota Land Cruiser.

SBU said, it assassinated Mikhail Shatsky a leading Russian missile scientist who worked on upgrading cruise missiles used on the battlefield in Ukraine. His body of was discovered in Kuzminsky forest park, at Kotelniki.

In December 2024 the head of the Russian army’s chemical weapons division Igor Kirillov was killed by an explosive device attached to a scooter outside an apartment building in Moscow. It was the most targeted assassination of a senior military official since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Guardian.

<doc id="709227" wikidata="Q7882916" url="?curid=709227" title="Unconscious communication">
<text>Unconscious (or [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]) communication is the subtle, unintentional, unconscious cues that provide information to another individual. It can be verbal (speech patterns, physical activity while speaking, or the tone of voice of an individual) or it can be non-verbal (facial expressions and body language). Some psychologists instead use the term &quot;honest signals&quot; because such cues are involuntary behaviors that often convey emotion whereas body language can be controlled. Many decisions are based on unconscious communication, which is interpreted and created in the right hemisphere of the brain. The right hemisphere is dominant in perceiving and expressing body language, facial expressions, verbal cues, and other indications that have to do with emotion but it does not exclusively deal with the unconscious.

Little is known about the unconscious mind or about how decisions are made based on unconscious communications except that they are always unintentional. There are two types of unconscious communications: intrapersonal and interpersonal.

Research has shown that human conscious attention can attend to 5–9 items simultaneously. All other information is processed by the unconscious mind. For example, the unconscious mind sometimes picks up on and relates non-verbal cues about an individual based on how they have arranged their settings such as their home or place of work.

== Unconscious mind ==
Not much is known about the unconscious mind but it is believed to contain the biological instincts that humans act on every day, such as sex and aggression. A person is completely unaware of what happens within the unconscious mind.

Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud made the concept of the unconscious popular; and he based most of his theories on psychoanalysis on the concept. According to Freud, the subconscious mind rests right below the conscious mind, and has easy access to the thoughts and feelings that are kept in this state – as opposed to the unconscious mind (access to which is, in Freud&#x27;s view, impossible). Freud believed that we projected our unconscious emotions onto others.

== Intrapersonal ==
Intrapersonal communication is language use or thought internal to the communicator. It includes many mental activities such as thinking, calculating, planning, talking to one&#x27;s self, internal monologue, and day-dreaming. Intrapersonal communication affects how people perceive themselves: either in a negative or positive way. Joseph Jordania hypothesized that intrapersonal communication was created to avoid silence because as social creatures we feel uncomfortable with extended periods of silence. Intrapersonal unconscious communication is when dreams, previous experiences, or hypnosis affects a person&#x27;s choices or experiences unconsciously.

== Interpersonal ==
Interpersonal communication includes message sending and message reception between two or more individuals. This can include all aspects of communication such as listening, persuading, asserting, non-verbal communication, and more. Interpersonal unconscious communication includes unintentional facial expressions, body language, tone of voice, and speech patterns while interacting with another individual that the other individual interprets for their own knowledge. Studies suggest that when presented with an emotional facial expression, participants instinctively react with movement in facial muscles that are mimicking the original facial expression.

There are six different reasons for non-verbal communication:
# Complementing: adding extra information to verbal communication
# Contradicting: the non-verbal messages contradict one&#x27;s verbal messages
# Repeating: emphasize or clarify the verbal message
# Regulating: coordinate the verbal dialogue between people
# Substituting: when a non-verbal message is used in place of a verbal message
# Accenting: emphasizing a particular point in a verbal message
This system may have been evolutionarily evolved to hint to other people emotional cues. When a person uses one of the following points, as stated above (i.e. intonation, facial expression...) they may do so to regulate the emotion of one or more people. The subject or the contents of the message may be less of importance rather than the transmission of emotional cues itself.

Additionally, the manner of phrasing sentences and selection of words that the brain subconsciously generates are used as well to regulate other peoples emotions. Since a particular utilization of words may affect people differently such as &quot;That painting is unattractive.&quot; and &quot;That painting is ugly.&quot;, whereby the latter sentence will have a worse emotional impact than the former upon hearing. And here again the contents of the message are less of relevance than the actual emotional impact it will deliver.

<doc id="709235" wikidata="Q1933555" url="?curid=709235" title="Mike Sullivan (ice hockey)">
<text>Michael Barry Sullivan (born February 27, 1968) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the fourth round, 69th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Sullivan has also played for the San Jose Sharks, Calgary Flames, Boston Bruins, and Phoenix Coyotes. Internationally, he represented the United States twice, including at the 1997 World Championship.

Sullivan turned to coaching upon his retirement in 2002 and served two seasons as the head coach of the Boston Bruins between 2003 and 2005. He formerly served an assistant coach with the Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Rangers, and Vancouver Canucks, and subsequently in player development with the Chicago Blackhawks for one year. After serving as head coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, he took over as head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins in December 2015, and led the team to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships becoming the only American-born coach to win the Stanley Cup more than once.

Sullivan was named head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but with the NHL withdrawing from the Olympics due to a COVID-19 surge, David Quinn, former head coach of the New York Rangers, was named as his replacement.

==Early life==
Sullivan was born on February 27, 1968, in Marshfield, Massachusetts to Irish-American parents George and Myrna. Sullivan is their second youngest child and played hockey growing up under the tutelage of his father. While Sullivan and his brothers played hockey, his two sisters Kathie and Debbie figure skated.

==Playing career==
Sullivan played high school hockey at Boston College High School and college hockey at Boston University where he scored a game-winning goal in the Beanpot Tournament. He was drafted 69th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. He elected to remain at BU to finish school, and in 1990, he began an 11-year National Hockey League career in which he accumulated 54 goals, 82 assists, 136 points and 203 penalty minutes in 709 games.

==Coaching career==

Sullivan began coaching professional hockey during the 2002–2003 season, when he became the head coach of the Providence Bruins of the AHL. In his only season, his team had a 41–17–9–4 record.

Sullivan was hired as the 26th head coach of the Boston Bruins in 2003 by then-general manager Mike O&#x27;Connell. His first season with the Bruins was highly successful, as he led them to a 41–19–15–7 record, 104 points and a first-place finish in the Northeast Division. However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Montreal Canadiens. After the lockout, Sullivan and the Bruins struggled to win in the new NHL, as they ended the 2005–2006 season with a dismal 29–37–16 record, missing the playoffs and finishing last in the Northeast Division. He was subsequently fired by the incoming general manager Peter Chiarelli on June 27, 2006, and was replaced by Dave Lewis.

Sullivan served as an assistant coach of the U.S. Olympic hockey team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy.

On May 31, 2007, he was named assistant coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was then promoted to associate coach the following season. On July 16, 2009, he was named assistant coach of the New York Rangers.

On July 3, 2013, he was named assistant coach of the Vancouver Canucks.

On January 20, 2014, Sullivan was named interim head coach of the Canucks, while head coach John Tortorella served a six-game suspension. On January 21, in his first game as acting head coach, the Canucks would go on to record a 2–1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.

On May 1, 2014, Sullivan, along with head coach John Tortorella, were relieved of their respective duties in the Canucks organization. Sullivan subsequently joined the Chicago Blackhawks as a player development coach.

On June 18, 2015, the Pittsburgh Penguins named Sullivan as the new head coach of their American Hockey League affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.

He was named head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins on December 12, 2015, upon the firing of then-head coach Mike Johnston.

On June 12, 2016, Sullivan became just the sixth head coach in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup after being hired mid-season. He did so when the Penguins defeated the San Jose Sharks in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals. Sullivan joined both Scotty Bowman (1992) and Dan Bylsma (2009) as the third coach in franchise history (and the sixth in NHL history) to win the Stanley Cup following a mid-season coaching change. Sullivan is also the first coach to lead the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cup championships with their victory over the Nashville Predators in the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals, and is the only American-born head coach to win the Stanley Cup multiple times.

On December 16, 2017, he recorded his 100th career win with the Penguins becoming just the fourth coach to do so for the organization.

On July 5, 2019, Sullivan signed a four-year contract extension.

After a 5–2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks on October 16, 2021, Sullivan became the winningest coach in the Penguins history, surpassing Dan Bylsma&#x27;s record with 253 wins behind the Penguins bench.

On April 12, 2023, with the New York Islanders victory over the Montreal Canadiens, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2005–06 NHL season.

<text>The Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) is the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy of engineering.

The Academy was founded in June 1976 as the Fellowship of Engineering with support from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who became the first senior fellow and remained so until his death. The Fellowship was incorporated and granted a royal charter on 17 May 1983 and became the Royal Academy of Engineering on 16 March 1992. It is governed according to the charter and associated statutes and regulations (as amended from time to time). In June 2024 His Majesty the King became Patron of the Academy.

==History==
Conceived in the late 1960s, during the Apollo space program and Harold Wilson&#x27;s espousal of &quot;white heat of technology&quot;, the Fellowship of Engineering was born in the year of Concorde&#x27;s first commercial flight.

The Fellowship&#x27;s first meeting, at Buckingham Palace on 11 June 1976, enrolled 126 of the UK&#x27;s leading engineers. The first fellows included Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle, the jet engine developer, the structural engineer Sir Ove Arup, radar pioneer Sir George G. MacFarlane, the inventor of the bouncing bomb, Sir Barnes Wallis, Francis Thomas Bacon, the inventor of the alkaline fuel cell, and father of the UK computer industry Sir Maurice Wilkes. The Fellowship&#x27;s first president, Christopher Hinton, had driven the UK&#x27;s supremacy in nuclear power.

The Fellowship focused on championing excellence in all fields of engineering. Activities began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the Distinction lecture series, now known as the Hinton lectures. The Fellowship was asked to advise the Department of Industry for the first time, and the Academy became host and presenter of the MacRobert Award.

In the 1980s, the Fellowship received its own royal charter along with its first government grant-in-aid. At the same time, it also received significant industrial funding, initiated its research programme to build bridges between academia and industry, and opened its doors to international and honorary fellows.

In 1990, the Academy launched its first major initiative in education, Engineering Education Continuum, which evolved into the BEST Programme and Shape the Future and Tomorrow&#x27;s Engineers.

The Academy&#x27;s increasing level of influence – in policy, research and education – was recognized when it was granted a royal title and became The Royal Academy of Engineering in 1992. In 2014 the academy launched its annual Africa Prize.

The Academy&#x27;s current logo is inspired by the Neolithic hand axe, humans&#x27; first technological advance, which was taken to be a symbol appropriate to the Academy, supposedly representative of the ever-changing relationship between humanity and technology.

==Location==
The Academy&#x27;s premises, 3–4 Carlton House Terrace, are in a Grade I listed building overlooking St James&#x27;s Park, designed by architect John Nash and owned by the Crown Estate. The Academy shares the Terrace with two of its sister academies, the British Academy and the Royal Society, as well as other institutes.

The building was renamed Prince Philip House, after renovation works were completed in 2012.

==Activities==
The Academy is instrumental in two policy alliances set up in 2009 to provide coherent advice on engineering education and policy across the profession: Education for Engineering and &quot;Engineering the Future&quot;.

The Academy is one of four agencies that receive funding from the UK&#x27;s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for activities that support government policy on public understanding of science and engineering.

As part of its programme to communicate the benefits and value of engineering to society, the Academy publishes a quarterly magazine, &quot;Ingenia&quot; . The Academy says that &quot;Ingenia&quot; is written for a non-specialist audience and is &quot;aimed at all those with an interest in engineering, whether working in business and industry, government, academia or the financial community&quot;. The Academy also makes &quot;Ingenia&quot; available to A-Level students in 3,000 schools in the UK.

==Presidents==
The president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the elected officer of the Academy, presides over meetings of the council. The president is elected for a single term of not more than five years.

==Fellows ==

The Fellowship currently includes more than 1,500 engineers from all sectors and disciplines of engineering. The fellows, distinguished by the title Fellow of The Royal Academy of Engineering and the post-nominal designation FREng, lead, guide, and contribute to the Academy&#x27;s work and provide expertise.

The Royal Fellows of the Academy are the Duke of Kent and the Princess Royal.

==Diversity==
The Academy strives to ensure that the pool of candidates for election to the Fellowship better reflects the diverse make-up of society as a whole. It set up the Proactive Membership Committee in 2008 to identify and support the nomination of candidates from underrepresented areas, with the aim of boosting the number of women candidates, engineers from industry and small and medium enterprises, those from emerging technologies and ethnically diverse backgrounds.

== Awards and prizes ==
* With the support of the Worshipful Company of Engineers, the Academy manages the annual Royal Academy of Engineering MacRobert Award, the premier prize for UK innovation in engineering. First presented in 1969, the award honours the winning company with a gold medal and the team members with a prize of £50,000.
* The Academy oversees the awarding of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering (QEPrize). The QEPrize is an international, £1 million engineering prize that &quot;rewards and celebrates the engineers responsible for a ground-breaking innovation that has been of global benefit to humanity&quot;. The objective of the prize is to &quot;raise the public profile of engineering and to inspire young people to become engineers&quot;.

<text>The West Gate Bridge is a steel, box girder, cable-stayed bridge in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, spanning the Yarra River just north of its mouth into Port Phillip. It carries the West Gate Freeway and is a vital link between the Melbourne central business district (CBD) and western suburbs, with the industrial suburbs in the west, and with the city of Geelong to the south-west. It is part of one of the busiest road corridors in Australia. The high span bridge was built to allow large cargo ships to access the docks in the Yarra River.

The main river span is long, and above the water. The total length of the bridge is . It is the fifth-longest in Australia, the longest being Melbourne&#x27;s Bolte Bridge at . The West Gate Bridge is twice as long as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and is one of the highest road decks in Australia, higher than Sydney Harbour Bridge&#x27;s . It carries up to 200,000 vehicles per day.

The bridge passes over Westgate Park, a large environmental and recreational reserve created during the bridge&#x27;s construction. 

==Transportation==

===Motor vehicles===
The West Gate Bridge is a 10-lane dual-carriageway freeway bridge, carrying five lanes of motor vehicle traffic in each direction. The freeway corridor (including the bridge itself) carries a very high volume and occupancy of traffic; a total of between 180,000 and 200,000 cars, trucks, and motorcycles use it per day, according to VicRoads. This makes the West Gate Bridge and West Gate Freeway one of the busiest road corridors in Australia.

As it is the only main direct link between Melbourne&#x27;s CBD and the west, it is frequently congested during the morning and afternoon peaks and is constantly busy due to the number of vehicles coming in and out of the Port of Melbourne. The bridge was originally tolled but John Cain&#x27;s government made a promise at the 1985 election to discontinue tolls; this came into effect in November of that year.

The bridge is windswept as there are no significant obstructing terrain features for some distance, particularly in the quadrant from south to west, a common wind direction. This can lead to issues for motorbikes, trucks and other high-sided vehicles in higher wind speeds. Previously wind warning lights were present at the bridge approaches to control traffic (amber – bridge closed to motorbikes and high vehicles, red – closed to all traffic), but the former practice is to reduce the speed limit to or when the wind speed gets too high. This has since been replaced with a modern variable speed limit system as part of the 2008–11 upgrade.

===Cycling===
Cyclists are prohibited from using the bridge except for special bicycle events, notably the Melbourne Summer Cycle, a fundraising event for multiple sclerosis, and the Around the Bay in a Day event that raises money for The Smith Family charity. The Westgate Punt is a foot ferry that runs directly below the bridge, taking cyclists and pedestrians across the Yarra between a jetty at Fishermans Bend near Westgate Park – Bay Trail and a jetty adjacent to Scienceworks Museum – Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail. It operates on demand, from Monday to Friday in morning and evening peaks, and on weekends and public holidays from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm.

== History ==

=== Proposals and realisation ===

The notion of a Lower Yarra River Crossing has formal origins as early as 1888, when Victoria’s Public Works Department first proposed a tunnel under the Yarra. The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission&#x27;s &quot;Plan of General Development&quot; proposed a bridge for a road between Geelong Road (&#x27;west of Kororoit Creek&#x27;) and Ingles St, Port Melbourne. Road routes between central Melbourne and the west were, however, bridged further north, and the usual method of crossing at the lower Yarra was via skiffs until 1912, when ferries were first instituted, the Newport steam ferry operated by the City of Williamstown taking prominence between 1931 and 1974.

The Western Industries Association was formed in August 1957 and claimed to be ‘representative of all industries in Altona, Footscray, Sunshine, Werribee and Williamstown districts’. Having formed a sub-committee to investigate a Yarra crossing, in 1958 it asked Victorian Premier Henry Bolte ‘to give urgent consideration to construction of a traffic tunnel under the Yarra.’ The Association had been told by &#x27;shipping interests&#x27; that a bridge would not be acceptable for the crossing. The tunnel, it was suggested, would carry 30000 cars a day; differing estimates on the capacity of the &#x27;overtaxed&#x27; ferry suggested it could only handle between 1200 and 2000. The Victorian Government&#x27;s response to the proposal, delivered by Commissioner for Public Works Thomas Maltby, was that the government&#x27;s finances were inadequate to undertake a crossing urgently and that any such project would require private investment. In 1961 Lower Yarra Crossing Limited was formed, a non-profit company to develop the crossing. In mid-1960 it was announced that the Association would raise the money to construct the bridge with government support keeping interest rates low; the arrangement was envisaged as not, in itself, profit-making. In this year, the Western Industries Association applied to government for license to construct and operate a crossing on a toll basis. 

In 1961 the Association formed Lower Yarra Crossing Ltd. Test drilling began late in that year by which point the Association once again became publicly open to the construction of a bridge, rather than a tunnel. Nevertheless Danish tunnel engineering firm Christiani and Nielson were engaged as consultants. Chief amongst the concerns regarding a tunnel was the limitation on particular goods or cargoes - notably, flammable material - that could legally, or safely, be carried through a tunnel. 

In the state government&#x27;s analysis, the cost of building a bridge or a tunnel would be equal, however, notwithstanding the Harbour Trust&#x27;s strong advocacy for a tunnel, it was felt by those in power that a bridge would more readily allow use by petrol tankers. In 1965, Yvonne A. Van Den Nouwelant writes, ‘the Lower Yarra Crossing Authority was granted a franchise by Act of Parliament and in 1968 construction started on the West Gate Bridge.’ It was noted by the press at the time that the location of the bridge&#x27;s eastern approaches would require the removal of the Fishermen&#x27;s Bend airstrip.

=== Collapse ===

Two years into construction of the bridge, at 11:50 am on 15 October 1970, the 112-metre (367-foot) span between piers 10 and 11 collapsed and fell 50 metres (164 feet) to the ground and water below. Thirty-five construction workers died and eighteen were injured, and it remains Australia&#x27;s worst industrial accident. Many of those who died were on lunch break beneath the structure in workers&#x27; huts, which were crushed by the falling span. Others were working on and inside the span when it fell. The whole mass plummeted into the Yarra River mud with an explosion of gas, dust and mangled metal that shook buildings hundreds of metres away. Nearby houses were spattered with flying mud. The roar of the impact, the explosion, and the fire that followed, could be clearly heard over away. On the following morning, 16 October, Sir Henry Bolte (Premier of Victoria) announced that a Royal Commission would be set up immediately to look into the cause of the disaster. Prime Minister John Gorton, said: &quot;I am sure the whole of Australia is shocked and saddened by the serious accident at West Gate Bridge. Please extend my deepest sympathy to all those families to whom this tragic event has brought such grief.&quot;
==== Cause ====

The Royal Commission concluded on 14 July 1971. It attributed the failure of the bridge to two causes: the structural design by designers Freeman Fox &amp; Partners, and an unusual method of construction by World Services and Construction, the original contractors for the project.

On the day of the collapse, there was a difference in camber of between two half-girders at the west end of the span which needed to be joined. It was proposed that the higher one be weighted down with 10 concrete blocks, each weighing , which were located on-site. The weight of those blocks caused the span to buckle, which was a sign of structural failure. The longitudinal joining of the half-girders was partially complete when orders came through to remove the buckle. As the bolts were removed, the bridge snapped back and the span collapsed.

==== Collapse memorials ====
Six twisted fragments of the collapsed bridge can be found in the West Gate garden at the engineering faculty of Monash University, Clayton campus. The university acquired them after being asked to participate in the investigation of the collapse. It is said that they are to remind engineers of the consequences of their errors.

Commemorations have been held on 15 October every year since the collapse. A West Gate Bridge Memorial Park is located near the bridge. It opened on 15 October 2004, the 34th anniversary of the collapse. It includes the West Gate Bridge Memorial and Sculpture, and the memorial for six who died in the Spotswood sewer tunnel collapse of 12 April 1895.

===Completion===
Three other steel box girder bridges collapsed during their construction between 1969 and 1971: the Fourth Danube Bridge in Vienna on 6 November 1969; Cleddau Bridge (Milford Haven), Wales on 2 June 1970; and the South Bridge over the Rhine River in Koblenz on 10 November 1971. The UK government responded by setting up the Merrison Committee of Inquiry, headed by Sir Alec Merrison. The Merrison Committee provided an interim report in May 1971, and a final report in February 1973 on new design and workmanship rules for steel box-girder bridges. 

Following the publication of the Report of the Royal Commission in August 1971, the Lower Yarra Crossing Authority, a non-profit company, formed its own Directorate of Engineering. In September 1971, Hans G. Wolfram, FIEAust and a Director of Gutteridge, Haskins &amp; Davey, was appointed the Director of Engineering. He was responsible for the re-design, supervision of construction, and contract administration of West Gate Bridge until its completion. The Chairman of the Lower Yarra Crossing Authority was Oscar G. Meyer. The Deputy Chairman was Bernard J. Callinan, who was also Chairman of the Technical Committee. In 1971, the Authority was renamed as the West Gate Bridge Authority.

Intensive reviews of the structure focused attention on the inadequate strength of the original design of the bridge&#x27;s deck. This consisted of a 100 mm reinforced concrete slab acting compositely with a steel deck plate stiffened by bulb flats. Numerous proposals were examined and Wolfram recommended replacing the original steel and concrete deck by a lighter and stronger orthotropic steel deck as technically and economically the most appropriate solution. This orthotropic deck is a steel plate stiffened longitudinally by closely spaced cellular troughs and laterally, at intervals, by cross beams. The proof engineer was Karlheinz Roik, a professor of steel construction at TU Berlin. He independently checked the re-design of the West Gate Bridge in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission. The re-design was also checked against the German code DIN 4114 and the Appraisal Rules of the Merrison Committee&#x27;s reports. The re-design was endorsed by four other university professors of civil engineering: F.B. Bull (Adelaide), N.W. Murray (Monash), J.W. Roderick (Sydney) and L.K. Stevens (Melbourne).

Construction resumed in 1972 with World Services and Construction continuing to fabricate the boxes and to carry out their sub-assembly, but with a joint venture between Redpath Dorman Long and John Holland (Constructions) completing the construction of the steel portion of the bridge. Additional strengthening of the structure had to be designed for the erection because the stresses could exceed those of the in-service condition. The joint venture contractor engaged Flint and Neill of London for this and their design was proof-checked by the Directorate of Engineering. 

Charles, Prince of Wales visited the West Gate Bridge project in October 1974 and met with members of the West Gate Bridge Authority and workers. 

After 10 years of construction, the bridge was completed in 1978 at a cost of $202 million. 

Speed cameras were erected on the bridge in 2004, but were not activated until September 2005, because of issues with a similar camera on the Western Ring Road. However these speed cameras were switched off in 2005, and currently remain disabled, as the sway of the bridge prevents secondary verification of the alleged speed against a fixed point. In 2006 the State Government spent $1.3 million on erecting railway style boom barriers at each entrance to the bridge to block traffic in the event of a terrorist attack. In March 2007, the State Government announced that two flagpoles would be erected atop the main bridge pylons, to fly the Australian and Victorian flags, each being in size and above sea level. Costing $350,000 to install and $15,000 a year to maintain, the flags were unfurled on 24 September 2008.

On 5 August 2007, it was reported that the Victorian Government was planning a $240 million project to identify and eliminate structural weaknesses in the bridge, with specific concerns including crash barriers, cracking, corrosion and potential buckling. News of the work was prompted by the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis. Experts were reported as saying the West Gate was initially designed to carry loads of but now carried B-double trucks weighing up to . The bridge was built to carry 40,000 vehicles a day but volumes had grown to more than four times the original number, approximately 160,000 vehicles on an average day.

===Expansion===
On 17 May 2006, the State Government as part of its Meeting Our Transport Challenges plan announced plans to change traffic flow in peak periods on the West Gate Bridge and approaches to it, using a reversible lane to provide five traffic lanes in the peak direction, opposing traffic having three lanes. This was to be done using overhead signals and barriers; the State Government allocated funds to this project in its 2006–2007 state budget, but the works were never carried out.

In 2008 the expansion plans were revised as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, when it was announced that the bridge would be widened to five lanes in each direction, the space being gained by narrowing the existing traffic lanes and closing the emergency lanes, in a move criticised by Victorian fire, police and ambulance unions. Overhead gantries would be used to direct traffic out of lanes when breakdowns and accidents occur. Costed at $240 million, each lane would be wide; by comparison, lanes on the Sydney Harbour Bridge have a width of . Roads Minister Tim Pallas claimed that the plan would allow the bridge to carry 50 per cent more vehicles, while reducing crashes by 20 per cent. Structural analysis work on the bridge concluded in early 2009, and was completed over a 14-month period. Works to strengthen the bridge commenced in the first half of 2009, with the entire strengthening project scheduled for completion in 2011.

On 22 June 2011, all five lanes were finally opened to the public in both directions, with the completion of the required strengthening works. The full cost was $347 million, $107 million more than VicRoads had originally planned, but included considerable additional scope of works. This cost increase was after the deletion of $20 million architectural lighting originally included in the scope of the works. The engineers for the strengthening project, Flint &amp; Neill and Sinclair Knight Merz, won the 2012 Institution of Structural Engineers Supreme Award for structural engineering for the project.

===Flags===
On 11 March 2014, a 10-metre (33 ft) high artist-designed flag was raised on the western side of the bridge as part of the &quot;Melbourne Now&quot; exhibition, &quot;On Top of the World: Flags for Melbourne&quot;. The flag was a collaborative design between four contributing artists (Brook Andrew, Helen Johnson, Kate Daw and Jon Campbell) who shared an affinity with the bridge. The flag design is a reference to 1803 maritime communications by Rear Admiral Home Riggs Popham, the symbol on the flag meaning &quot;I can spare what you asked for&quot;. The flag was flown until the end of the &quot;Melbourne Now&quot; show on 25 March 2014. Since July 2022, the Aboriginal flag will formally fly over the bridge alongside the Australian flag permanently as announced. The cost was not disclosed, as with $25 million for the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

== Future ==
Strong growth in suburbs along the route, and increased freight through the Port of Melbourne, means that the corridor is experiencing traffic congestion during peak periods, is vulnerable to short-term interruptions, and is rapidly approaching capacity. Proposals to abate congestion by allowing more traffic have included bridge widening, a tunnel underneath the river, or adding a second deck to the bridge. Many such plans have come under fire from community groups such as the Public Transport Users Association and Environment Victoria, which advocate investment in alternative forms of transport.

A private sector report, made public in February 2006, suggested building a companion tunnel to the West Gate Bridge under the Yarra River, made up of three separate bores to carry traffic in either direction and a freight rail line. The portals would have been north of Williamstown Road in Port Melbourne, and between Blackshaws and Melbourne roads in Altona North.

In 2018, work began on the West Gate Tunnel, which is designed to provide an alternative to the West Gate Bridge. Work is expected to finish in 2025.

The State Government also assessed options for the development of another east–west link in 2008. Sir Rod Eddington, Chairman of the Victorian Major Events Company and former CEO of British Airways, was to head the assessment of the future east–west connections and recommend the best way forward for public transport, road and freight travel for the entire Monash-West Gate corridor. In December 2008, the State Government announced it was planning for such a link, anticipated to be a three-kilometre road tunnel under Footscray and the Maribyrnong River. Linking Dynon and Footscray Roads in the Port of Melbourne precinct to Geelong Road in West Footscray, now known as the East-West Link, its cost is estimated to be up to $10 billion.
==Suicides==
Owing to its height, the bridge became a popular location for suicides, with police data in the early 2000s showing up to one suicide occurring every three weeks at the West Gate Bridge. A 2004 coroner&#x27;s report recommended anti-suicide fencing or barriers be erected on the bridge to deter people from attempting to end their lives.

Those who argued for a suicide barrier claimed that most of those who jump from the West Gate Bridge do so through impulse, and that police officers who tried to save jumpers were putting their own lives in danger. There were reported incidents of police officers dangling off the side of the bridge while holding onto would-be jumpers. A 2000 Royal Melbourne Hospital study on people who jumped from the bridge found at least 62 cases between 1991 and 1998. Seven people survived the fall. Around 74 per cent of those who jumped from the bridge were male, with an average age of 33. More than 70 per cent were suffering from mental illness. Of those who jumped off the West Gate Bridge, 31 per cent fell onto land. Some of those who landed in water drowned afterwards.

=== Installation of anti-suicide fencing ===
In June 2008, Gabriela Garcia jumped off the West Gate Bridge with her 22-month-old son Oliver, and their bodies were found on the river bank below.

Seven months later on 29 January 2009, a 4-year-old girl, Darcey Freeman, was thrown off the bridge by her father, Arthur Freeman. She survived the fall but later died in hospital. Freeman was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison in April 2011; the apparent trigger for the incident was his recent separation and apparent fear of loss of access to the children (similar to the 2005 Robert Farquarson case).

A week after that incident, on 5 February 2009, 17-year-old Allem Halkic jumped from the inbound lanes near the Todd Road exit on the Port Melbourne side of the bridge. On walking up the bridge he was reported to have said to the VicRoads operator via the emergency phone, &quot;You better get someone here before I jump&quot;. Police responded within minutes of this, but were too late to save Halkic and found his body in the Westgate Park below. The case was significant as Halkic was a victim of cyberbullying in the days prior to this, and reportedly became the first death resulting from cyberbullying in Victoria. In October 2011 a coronial inquest was held into the death, again recommending (among other things) the installation of anti-suicide barriers on the bridge.

Following these incidents, a temporary suicide barrier of concrete crash barriers topped with a welded mesh fence was erected from February 2009. A permanent metal mesh barrier was subsequently installed along the length of the bridge in 2010–11 at a cost of $20 million. The barrier is reported to have reduced suicides from the bridge by 85 per cent.

Martin Henry Balsam was born November 4, 1919, in the Bronx borough of New York City, to Russian Jewish parents, Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Weinstein) and Albert Balsam, who was a manufacturer of women&#x27;s sportswear. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he participated in the drama club. He studied at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York with the German director Erwin Piscator and then served in the United States Army Air Forces from 1941 to 1945 during World War II, achieving the rank of Sergeant. He served as a sergeant radio operator in a B-24 in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations.

== Career ==
=== Theatre ===
Balsam made his professional debut in August 1941 in a production of &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; in Locust Valley. After World War II, he resumed his acting career in New York.

In 1947–1949, Balsam was a resident member of the summer stock company Town Hall Players in West Newbury, Massachusetts, a community-sponsored summer theatre. In early 1948, he was selected by Elia Kazan to be a member in the recently formed Actors Studio. He appeared consistently in Broadway and off-Broadway plays, something he would continue to do well into his screen acting career. Columnist Earl Wilson dubbed him &quot;The Bronx Barrymore&quot;.

In 1968, he won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in the 1967 Broadway production of &quot;You Know I Can&#x27;t Hear You When the Water&#x27;s Running&quot;.

=== Television ===
Balsam performed in several episodes of the studio&#x27;s dramatic television anthology series, broadcast between September 1948 and 1950. He appeared in many other television drama series, including &quot;Decoy&quot; with Beverly Garland, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (episodes &quot;The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine&quot; and &quot;The New Exhibit&quot;), as a psychologist in the pilot episode, &quot;Five Fingers&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;, as a retired U.N.C.L.E. agent in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode, &quot;The Odd Man Affair&quot;, and guest-starred in the two-part &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode, &quot;Death Stalks the Big Top&quot;. He also appeared in the &quot;Route 66&quot; episode, &quot;Somehow It Gets To Be Tomorrow&quot;.

He played Dr. Rudy Wells when the Martin Caidin novel &quot;Cyborg&quot; was adapted as a TV-movie pilot for &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1973), though he did not reprise the role for the subsequent series. In 1975, he appeared as James Arthur Cummins in the Joe Don Baker police drama &quot;Mitchell&quot;, a film that was eventually featured in a highly popular episode of the comedy film-riffing series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1993. He appeared as a spokesman/hostage in the TV movie &quot;Raid on Entebbe&quot; (1976) and as a detective in the TVM &quot;Contract on Cherry Street&quot; (1977), starring Frank Sinatra. He also appeared on an episode of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;. Balsam starred as Murray Klein on the &quot;All in the Family&quot; spin-off &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; for two seasons (1979–81) and returned for a guest appearance in the show&#x27;s fourth and final season.

=== Film ===
Balsam made his film debut with an uncredited role in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), directed by his Actors Studio colleague Elia Kazan. Balsam played an official of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey investigating mob involvement in the city&#x27;s waterfront unions. His breakthrough role came a few years later, when he played Juror #1 in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957). He would collaborate with the film&#x27;s director, Sidney Lumet, twice more with &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; (1971) and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974).

In 1960, he appeared in one of his best-remembered roles as private investigator Arbogast in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;, culminating in a scene in which Mrs. Bates chases him down a flight of stairs to stab him to death. Along with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, Balsam appeared in both the original &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962), and the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Arnold Burns in &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot; (1965). Balsam also performed the original voice of the HAL 9000 computer in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. He told a journalist in August 1966, &quot;I&#x27;m not actually seen in the picture at any time, but I sure create a lot of excitement projecting my voice through that machine. And I&#x27;m getting an Academy Award winner price for doing it, too.&quot; After his lines were recorded, director Stanley Kubrick decided &quot;Marty just sounded a little bit too colloquially American,&quot; and hired Douglas Rain to perform the role for the released film.

Balsam also appeared in such notable films as &quot;Time Limit&quot; with Richard Widmark, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard, &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; with George Peppard and Alan Ladd, &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; with Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, &quot;The Man&quot; with James Earl Jones, &quot;Hombre&quot; with Paul Newman and Fredric March, &quot;Catch-22&quot; with Alan Arkin and Jon Voight, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (as Admiral Husband E. Kimmel), &quot;Little Big Man&quot; with Dustin Hoffman, &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; with Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, &quot;The Delta Force&quot; with Lee Marvin, and &quot;The Goodbye People&quot;. One of his final acting appearances was in the 1994 horror parody &quot;The Silence of the Hams&quot;, which paid homage to his iconic role in &quot;Psycho&quot;.

Beyond Hollywood, Balsam was also a popular character actor in Italian films, beginning in 1960 when he starred in the Luigi Comencini film &quot;Everybody Go Home&quot;. He would star in several &quot;poliziottesco&quot; films throughout the 1970s, directed by the likes of Fernando Di Leo and Enzo G. Castellari. Balsam&#x27;s roles in these films would be re-dubbed into Italian, but he would loop his own lines in the English-language export versions. Balsam maintained close ties to Italy even after the end of the &quot;poliziottesco&quot; trend, traveling there for both professional and personal reasons, and starring in the Italian-produced television series &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;La piovra&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1951, Balsam married his first wife, actress Pearl Somner. They divorced three years later. His second wife was actress Joyce Van Patten. This marriage lasted for four years (from 1958 until 1962) with one daughter, Talia Balsam. He married his third wife, Irene Miller, in 1963. They had two children, Adam and Zoe Balsam, and divorced in 1987.

== Death ==
On February 13, 1996, Balsam died of a stroke in his hotel room while vacationing in Rome, Italy. He was 76 years old. He is interred at Cedar Park Cemetery, in Emerson, New Jersey.

<text>The M73 is a motorway in Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is long and connects the M74 motorway with the M80 motorway, providing an eastern bypass for Glasgow. The short stretch between junctions 1 and 2 is part of unsigned international E-road network E05, where it continues along the M8 through Glasgow. To the south, the M74 motorway is also part of the E05.

==Route==

Starting at the M74 junction 4 (M73 junction 1) by the River Clyde, it proceeds north with Birkenshaw to the east and crosses the Whifflet railway line before meeting the M8 and A8 at a three-level interchange, west of Swinton. Immediately afterwards the North Clyde railway line and then passes alongside Woodend Loch before reaching junction 2A at Gartcosh. There is then a further of motorway, before traffic exits onto the M80 westbound.

The road is a dual three-lane road between junctions 1 and 2, and a dual two-lane road between junctions 2 and 3. It is subject to the national speed limit.

==History and future plans==
Construction began in 1969 with the motorway opening between May 1971 and April 1972. Junction 2A was added at a later date.

In 2011, the northern end was extended as part of the M80 completion project. This connects the motorway into the completed M80 at a new interchange. Further work in 2017 improved access from the M74 at Junction 3A, and from the M8 and A8 at Baillieston Interchange.

<text>James Walter Braddock (June 7, 1905 – November 29, 1974) was an American boxer who was the world heavyweight champion from 1935 to 1937.

Fighting under the name James J. Braddock (ostensibly to follow the pattern set by two prior world boxing champions, James J. Corbett and James J. Jeffries), Braddock was known for his spoiling, counterpunching style, powerful right hand, and his iron chin. He had lost several bouts due to chronic hand injuries and was forced to work on the docks and collect social assistance to feed his family during the Great Depression. He made a comeback, and in 1935 he fought Max Baer for the world heavyweight championship and won. For this unlikely feat he was given the nickname &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; by Damon Runyon. Braddock was managed by Joe Gould.

==Early life==
Braddock was born on June 7, 1905, on West 48th Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood. He moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, at an early age. He was one of seven children being raised by immigrant parents; Irish mother Elizabeth O&#x27;Tool and Anglo-Irish father Joseph Braddock.

He stated his life&#x27;s early ambition was to play college football for Knute Rockne at the University of Notre Dame, though this did not come to pass, as he remarked that he had &quot;more brawn than brains&quot;.

==Boxing career==
Braddock pursued boxing, fighting as a light heavyweight. His first fight in a ring occurred on November 27, 1923. He turned pro at the age of 21. After three years, Braddock&#x27;s record was , with 21 knockouts.

In 1928, Braddock pulled off a major upset by knocking out highly regarded Tuffy Griffiths. The following year he earned a chance to fight for the title, but he narrowly lost to Tommy Loughran in a 15-round decision. Braddock was greatly depressed by the loss and badly fractured his right hand in several places in the process.

His next 33 fights were significantly less successful, with an record. With his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Braddock was forced to give up boxing and work as a longshoreman. Due to frequent injuries to his right hand, Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his longshoreman work, and it gradually became stronger than his right.

Braddock felt humiliated by having to accept government relief money, but he was inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement, a Christian social justice organization founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry. After his boxing comeback, Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various Catholic Worker Houses, and fed homeless people by inviting them to meals with his family.

===Max Baer fight===
In 1934, Braddock was given a fight with the highly touted John &quot;Corn&quot; Griffin. Although Braddock was intended simply as a stepping stone in Griffin&#x27;s career, he knocked out the &quot;Ozark Cyclone&quot; in the third round. Braddock then fought John Henry Lewis, a future light heavyweight champion. He won in one of the most important fights of his career. After defeating another highly regarded heavyweight contender, Art Lasky, whose nose he broke during the bout on March 22, 1935, Braddock was given a title fight against the World Heavyweight Champion, Max Baer.

Despite Braddock&#x27;s recent impressive victories, he was hand-picked by Baer&#x27;s handlers because he was seen as a little more than a journeyman fighter, an easy payday for the champion. Baer hardly trained for the bout; Braddock, on the other hand, trained hard. &quot;I&#x27;m training for a fight, not a boxing contest or a clownin&#x27; contest or a dance,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether it goes one round or three rounds or ten rounds, it will be a fight and a fight all the way. When you&#x27;ve been through what I&#x27;ve had to face in the last two years, a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet. He might come at me with a cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I&#x27;ve had to face.&quot; 

The bout occurred on June 13, 1935, at Madison Square Garden Bowl, in Long Island City, New York. Baer, ever the showman, &quot;brought gales of laughter from the crowd with his antics&quot; the night he stepped between the ropes to meet Braddock. As Braddock &quot;slipped the blue bathrobe from his pink back, he was the sentimental favorite of a Bowl crowd of 30,000, most of whom had bet their money 8-to-1 against him.&quot; Baer &quot;undoubtedly paid the penalty for underestimating his challenger beforehand and wasting too much time clowning.&quot; During the fight, a dogged Braddock took a few heavy hits from the powerful younger champion (30 years versus 26 years for Baer), but Braddock kept coming, wearing down Baer, who seemed perplexed by Braddock&#x27;s ability to take a punch. In the end, the judges gave Braddock the title with a unanimous decision, outpointing Baer 8 rounds to 6. A 10-to-1 underdog, Braddock won the Heavyweight Championship of the World as the in what was called &quot;the greatest fistic upset since the defeat of John L. Sullivan by Jim Corbett&quot;.

===Heavyweight champion; loss to Joe Louis ===
Braddock held the title of Heavyweight Champion from 1935 until 1937. His first title defense was to be against German Max Schmeling on June 3, 1937, in the Madison Square Garden Bowl. However, Braddock backed out of the bout in favor of a fight with Joe Louis in Chicago. Braddock argued he would have received only a US$25,000 purse against Schmeling, compared to $250,000 against rising star Louis. There was also concern that if Schmeling won, the Nazi government would deny American fighters opportunities to fight for the title. Finally, American commentators had expressed opposition to the fight in light of the connections between Schmeling and Adolf Hitler, with whom the German fighter had been associated after his earlier victory over Louis. The New York State Athletic Commission fined Gould and Braddock $1,000 each for canceling the fight with Schmeling.
In his only defense of the heavyweight title, Braddock lost to Louis in the 8th round by a knockout, the only one of his career.

Braddock and Louis saw each other frequently over the years, and the &quot;Brown Bomber&quot; always greeted him the same way: 
&quot;Hello, Champ.&quot; As Jeremy Schaap wrote, &quot;[Louis] fought eight world heavyweight champions, more than any other fighter ever, but he never called anyone but Jim Braddock &#x27;champ.&#x27;&quot; On the other hand, shortly after winning the title, Louis was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling&quot;. (Louis defeated Schmeling in 1938, part of his 12-year reign as Heavyweight champion, the longest championship reign in boxing history.)

Seven months after the Louis fight, Braddock had his next match with Tommy Farr and won in what turned out to be his last match.

While the fight with Louis was the end of Braddock as a major boxing force, part of his contract for that bout was to gain a portion of Louis&#x27; earnings over the next decade, which proved very lucrative for him.

== Later life ==
Braddock enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 and became a first lieutenant. He served in the Pacific theater on the island of Saipan, where he trained enlisted men in hand-to-hand combat.

Upon return, he opened a restaurant, called Braddock&#x27;s Corner, located at 157 W. 49th Street, in New York City, which was managed by Joe Gould. Braddock ultimately lost $15,000 on the restaurant venture. He invested in a marine equipment surplus supplier, which also lost money. Going back to manual labor, he helped construct the Verrazzano Narrows Bridge in the early 1960s.

==Personal life==
Braddock married Mae Fox in 1930, and the couple had three children, James (Jay) Jr., Howard and Rosemarie. He used the money from his fight with Joe Louis to buy a $14,000 home in North Bergen. Through Rosemarie, Braddock&#x27;s granddaughter is the actress Rosemarie DeWitt.

Braddock was a member of the Fairview Teeko Club, New Jersey, where he was regarded as one of the strongest teekoists.

==Death and legacy==

After his death in 1974 at the age of 69, James J. Braddock was interred in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Tenafly, New Jersey. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2001. James J. Braddock North Hudson County Park in North Bergen, New Jersey is named in his honor. On September 16, 2008, a 10-foot, 1,500-pound bronze statue of Braddock was erected in the park named in his honor not far from where he lived and trained. The statue was created by internationally renowned sculptor Zenos Frudakis.

The 2005 biographical film &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; tells Braddock&#x27;s story. Directed by Ron Howard, it stars Russell Crowe as Braddock and Renée Zellweger as his wife, Mae. The film had an estimated budget of $88 million and grossed $108.5 million worldwide. Crowe&#x27;s performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. Paul Giamatti, playing Braddock&#x27;s manager Joe Gould, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The role of neighbor Sara Wilson was played by Rosemarie DeWitt, who is Braddock&#x27;s real-life granddaughter. The film received mostly positive reviews.

<text>Giant-Man is the alias used by several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually in association with the alias Ant-Man. Hank Pym first appeared as Giant-Man in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #49, though he had appeared multiple times before, first in #27 as the scientist Henry Pym, and in #35 as Ant-Man. Regardless of iteration, Giant-Man usually has the power to enlarge to enormous sizes. Giant-Man also frequently overlaps with the alias Goliath. 

==Editorial Story==
Hank Pym, the first Giant-Man, with the Wasp, appeared in many superheroes stories published in the serial &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; and later, &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

Bill Foster later became the second Giant-Man and the Black Goliath.

Raz Malhotra debuted in &quot;The Astonishing Ant-Man&quot; #4 as the third Giant-Man and later as one of the supporting characters of the regular series, joining Scott Lang&#x27;s Ant-Man Security Solutions.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hank Pym===

Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Pym was the original version of Giant-Man. He used the super hero identity after joining the &quot;Avengers&quot; with the Wasp, Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk. He has also used other aliases like Ant-Man, Goliath, Yellowjacket, and the Wasp.

===Bill Foster===

William &quot;Bill&quot; Foster was the second version of Giant-Man who originally went by Black Goliath.

===Criti Noll===
The Skrull Criti Noll utilized the abilities of Hank Pym / Giant-Man during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline.

===Raz Malhotra===
Raz Malhotra is the third major version of Giant-Man. The character, created by Nick Spencer and Brent Schoonover, first appeared in &quot;Ant-Man&quot; Annual #1 (July 2015). He is an Indian American computer technician whose former field of study was in artificial intelligence at the time when Hank Pym started to rid the world of them. Lured by the supervillain Egghead, he freed himself from Egghead&#x27;s control with the help of Pym. Some time after Pym&#x27;s apparent death, Scott Lang gives Malhotra a Giant-Man uniform. After he is summoned to the portal city of Pan, Giant-Man joins the New Agents of Atlas to help protect the newly formed city. He later begins a relationship with Isaac Ikeda, the &quot;Protector of Pan&quot;. During the &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; storyline, Malhotra and the other New Agents are introduced to the original Agents by their leader Jimmy Woo.

===Scott Lang===

Scott Lang is the second major version of Giant-Man within the Ultimate Marvel universe. 

===Giant-Men===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe features the Giant-Men, a group of characters who have size-shifting powers and special jumpsuits that can grow with them. The Giant-Men are part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Reserves and consist of Giant-Men (such as David Scotty and Peter) as well as the alternately named Goliaths and Giant-Women.

The Giant-Men and the Rocket Men join Nick Fury, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch into fighting the Liberators.

During the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline, the Giant-Men were seen saving as many people as they can after Magneto caused a tidal wave that hit Manhattan.

The Giant-Men later carry the Ultimates away from the forces of Loki.

The Giant-Men later attack the Ultimates who easily defeat them.

<doc id="709257" wikidata="Q6713923" url="?curid=709257" title="M77 motorway">
<text>The M77 motorway is a motorway in Scotland. It begins in Glasgow at the M8 motorway at Kinning Park, and terminates near Kilmarnock at Fenwick, becoming the A77 dual carriageway. Changes were made in 2005 segregating a lane on the M8 motorway almost as far as the Kingston Bridge, which in January 2006 was extended further onto the bridge itself. It forms the most northerly part of the A77 trunk road which links Glasgow to Stranraer in the South West of Scotland. (The A77 itself continues to Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway.)

== History ==

The original M77 was a short spur route which took traffic from the M8 motorway in the Kinning Park area of Glasgow, ending at a roundabout on Dumbreck Road close to Bellahouston Park, although prior to this there had been an unused spur running to roughly Ibrox telephone exchange on Gower Street.

A large number of accidents and pollution problems caused in the suburban towns of Giffnock and Newton Mearns by commuter traffic and heavy lorries (the A77 is the main route for ferry-bound traffic sailing to Northern Ireland), saw an extension being built to the motorway in 1994 to bypass these areas, which was opened in December 1996. This was fiercely opposed by environmentalists, who set up a road protest camp, as it meant that the motorway would cut through the historic Pollok Country Park. Approval for the extension was granted and construction went ahead. A threatening visit in 1995 to the protesters of &#x27;Pollok Free State&#x27; by the Conservative Member of Parliament Allan Stewart (then the MP for Eastwood, the constituency including Newton Mearns, which the new road would bypass), accompanied by his airgun-wielding son, resulted in a political shot in the foot, contributing to his subsequent resignation, and a fine for his son in Paisley Sheriff Court. Stewart chose to stand down as MP for the Eastwood constituency in the next election in 1997, where the Conservatives lost the seat anyway to Labour.

The latest upgrade was instigated in 2003, and involved extending the M77 a further south to the village of Fenwick, near Kilmarnock. This replaced the dangerous 4-lane single carriageway of the A77 that dropped to a two lane single carriageway for the bend just north of the very sharp Mearns Road turn-off, and the A77/B764 (Eaglesham) junction (causing vehicles to queue dangerously on the outside lane on a bend to enter the B764 from the south) which were prone to fatal accidents. The scheme also included the Glasgow Southern Orbital (GSO) which bypasses the B764 Eaglesham Moor Road to East Kilbride. This also resulted in the closure of junction 5 on its previous site at Malletsheugh and the creation of a new junction 5 slightly further south at Maidenhill. An old slip road still exists, but is closed. The works were completed in April 2005. 

In 2006, junction 2 was rebuilt in conjunction with the building of the adjacent Silverburn Shopping Centre. The northbound off-ramp and southbound on-ramp are now routed via the access roundabout to the shopping centre.

In 2010 a relief lane was constructed between Plantation and Junction 1 southbound. The purpose of this was to ease the congestion that regularly occurs during peak rush hour.

The original segment of the A77 between Newton Mearns and Fenwick that previously carried the traffic now accommodated by the M77 has been converted into a two-lane single carriageway with cycle lanes. The remainder of the road through Newton Mearns has been converted into a two-lane dual carriageway with cycle lanes. The cycle lanes end at Eastwood Toll in Giffnock.

<text>The M80 is a motorway in Scotland&#x27;s central belt, running between Glasgow and Stirling via Cumbernauld and Denny and linking the M8, M73 and M9 motorways. Following completion in 2011, the motorway is long. Despite being only a two lane motorway, parts of the M80 Stepps Bypass are used by around 60,000 vehicles per day.

The M80 was constructed in three sections. The first section, from the village of Haggs to the M9 near Stirling, opened in 1974, followed in 1992 by the section from the M8 to the town of Stepps. The section from Stepps to Haggs was completed in September 2011, though it partially opened in February 2011 when the Moodiesburn bypass, from Stepps to the M73 at Mollinsburn, was completed; the section of the A80 from Mollinsburn to Haggs was then upgraded.

== Route ==
=== M8 to Stepps (junctions 1 to 3) ===
This section of road was originally envisioned during the M8&#x27;s construction in the 1960s, but was not realised until 1992, and is also known as the &#x27;Stepps Bypass&#x27;. It begins at M8 junction 13 in the Glasgow suburb of Blochairn. Construction began in 1990. 

It runs to the north of Stepps, under the Cumbernauld Railway Line with exits for Bishopbriggs, Lenzie and Kirkintilloch, where it continues onto the new section, completed in 2011.

=== Stepps to Haggs (junctions 3 to 7) ===
The Stepps to Haggs section was completed in September 2011, completing the M80 route.

A short section of offline upgrade takes the route from the former terminus at junction 3 (Stepps), to a new junction with the M73. After this, the route follows an on-line upgrade of the former A80 through Cumbernauld. It is mainly two-lane dual carriageway.

===Haggs to Pirnhall (junctions 7 to 9)===
At the junction with the A803, the road rejoins the older section of the M80 (opened in 1974) and runs for about until it meets the M876 for traffic towards the Kincardine Bridge.

The M80 then continues north, passing to the west of Denny and after meets a junction with the A91 (the same roundabout interchange also hosts Stirling Services) and then merges into the M9 just outside Stirling at Bannockburn.

== M80 Stepps to Haggs completion ==
The M80 Stepps to Haggs Completion Project connected the two-halves of the current motorway via an online upgrade of the existing A80, passing through Cumbernauld and Auchenkilns, and the offline creation of new motorway from Stepps to Mollinsburn. Although various plans were considered from the 1970s to 1990s to connect the two sections of motorway, it was not until 2003 that a definitive timeline for proposing, developing and executing a completion plan was announced.

Two routes were proposed for development: the so-called Kelvin Valley route, which would create a bypass to the north of the existing line of the A80, and the &quot;online&quot; upgrade of the existing A80 to motorway grade. In October 2005, the project was put to a public inquiry, which ended in August 2006. The Kelvin Valley route was not chosen as it would have breached the Antonine Wall and destroyed the Castlecary Roman fort; instead the online upgrade of the A80 through Cumbernauld was selected.

Originally budgeted to cost £130180million, but was estimated to cost £320million, preparatory works were started in November 2008, and construction work began in January 2009. The project was completed in September 2011.

The upgrade plans were set into three discrete phases. Phase one involved the creation of of road from Stepps, routing north of Muirhead, Moodiesburn and Chryston, and meeting the line of the existing A80 at Mollinsburn with the construction of a new interchange, connecting the M80 with the M73 and the western section of the A80. Phase two required the online upgrade of the A80 between Mollinsburn and Auchenkilns, with the attendant upgrade of adjoining on-slip and off-slip roads, meeting the Auchenkilns Interchange. The interchange was opened in November 2005 after the online grade separation of the Auchenkilns Roundabout from the line of the dual carriageway created a grade separated dumbbell interchange, linking the A80 (and subsequently the M80) with the A73 and B8048. Phase three saw the A80 upgraded online from Auchenkilns to the Haggs Interchange east of Cumbernauld – also seeing some junctions being upgraded, but with some being removed – completing the connection of the western M80 to the eastern M80, and connecting to the M876 and M9 motorways. The M80 crosses the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk railway line and Forth and Clyde Canal.

==Fictional team biography==
===Baron Heinrich Zemo&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
The original Masters of Evil (consisting of existing Marvel Comics supervillains the Black Knight, Melter, and Radioactive Man) was gathered by Heinrich Zemo. Despite attempting to capture the Avengers with Adhesive X and spreading it over New York City, the Avengers find an antidote with the help of Paste-Pot Pete, give it to the Masters in secret, and then send most of the members to jail. Zemo is tricked into opening a container filled with tear gas inside his helicopter, but escapes anyway.

Baron Zemo leads the team in his revenge on Captain America and the Avengers. The team had been joined by the Enchantress and the Executioner, whom Zemo found in their exile to Earth that was imposed on them by Odin for attacking Thor. The Enchantress hypnotizes Thor into attacking the Avengers, but Iron Man breaks him out of the trance. Meanwhile, Captain America has been lured to South America to fight Zemo. After defeating Zemo, Captain America returns on Zemo&#x27;s helicopter and stops Zemo from shooting the Avengers. However, Enchantress casts a spell that gets the helicopter to the rooftop she and the Executioner are on. The Executioner knocks Captain America out by striking his shoulder, and takes him out of the helicopter, after which they all try to escape. The Masters are sent to another dimension in a space warp generated by Thor.

Two issues later, Enchantress returns them to Earth using a spell. Simon Williams is given superhuman strength with an ionic ray, though he is told he will die in a week unless given an antidote Zemo has. He captures the Wasp and lures the Avengers into a trap, but sacrifices himself to save the Avengers. Immortus appears and offers to help the Masters by defeating the Avengers. He succeeds in sending Captain America to the Tower of London in 1760. The Masters attack the Avengers, but Captain America manages to return. The Enchantress, sensing defeat, sends the villains back in time to before they met Immortus.

In a later issue, Zemo kidnaps Rick Jones with an attractor beam and has the Enchantress and the Executioner release the Black Knight and the Melter (the Radioactive Man having been deported back to China). They attack the other Avengers, forcing Captain America to go alone to Zemo&#x27;s kingdom to rescue Rick. The Executioner tells the Avengers that a battle in the city would hurt many people, meaning they should surrender. Captain America blinds Zemo with his shield and Zemo dies when he accidentally triggers a rock slide. The Black Knight and the Melter are then captured after Thor transports them to another dimension with different scientific laws, meaning their weapons rebound. The Enchantress and the Executioner escape by running away before the transportation happened.

===Ultron&#x27;s Masters of Evil===

The second version, organized by Ultron, consisted of Black Knight, Klaw, Melter, Radioactive Man, and Whirlwind. Black Knight later betrayed the Masters of Evil and helped the Avengers defeat them.

===Egghead&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
Criminal scientist Egghead organized a third version, consisting of Moonstone, Scorpion, Tiger Shark, and Whirlwind. After the team&#x27;s defeat, Egghead kept only Moonstone and Tiger Shark; the Scorpion and Whirlwind were replaced with Beetle, Shocker, and Radioactive Man. Egghead uses this incarnation to assist him in making technological breakthroughs.

===Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
====First version====
Helmut Zemo formed the fourth version of the Masters of Evil from over a dozen villains, consisting of Absorbing Man, Blackout, Black Mamba, Fixer, Goliath, Grey Gargoyle, Mister Hyde, Moonstone, Screaming Mimi, Tiger Shark, Titania, Whirlwind, the Wrecking Crew (Bulldozer, Piledriver, Thunderball and Wrecker), and Yellowjacket, created with the goal of overwhelming the Avengers with sheer raw power, whereas others had attempted to match the current line-up.

The villains storm Avengers Mansion in a multi-issue storyline titled &quot;Avengers Under Siege&quot;.

A flashback later revealed that Augustus Roman&#x27;s family had died during the fight between the Avengers and this incarnation of the Masters of Evil.

====Second version====
The sixth incarnation was again assembled by Helmut Zemo, and posed as superheroes known as the Thunderbolts. In addition to Zemo, the team consisted of Beetle, Fixer, Goliath, Moonstone, and Screaming Mimi. All eventually became heroes and renounced their criminal ways, though Zemo, the Fixer, and Moonstone all returned to villainy some time later.

====Third version====
Baron Helmut Zemo created an 11th incarnation consisting of Whiplash, Man-Killer, Klaw, Tiger Shark, and the Wrecking Crew, all of whom had been members of previous incarnations of the Masters of Evil. Baron Zemo sent them out to persuade Atlas of the Thunderbolts, the former Goliath of Zemo&#x27;s earlier incarnation of the Masters of Evil, to rejoin the team. Atlas resisted and only an unexpected reappearance of the Thunderbolt Jolt interrupted the Masters&#x27; plan. The Masters then went after the Winter Soldier, who was then leading the Thunderbolts, and captured him. Zemo and the Masters then assaulted the Thunderbolts in their base, capturing several of them.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Baron Zemo has Kobik send Bucky Barnes back through time to World War II and another battle with the Thunderbolts, in which the Man-Killer was apparently killed by Kobik. Upon Atlas, the Fixer, and Moonstone joining the Masters of Evil, they worked to reassemble Kobik. As Erik Selvig hordes the fragments that he has, kisses them, and commits suicide, the Kobik-reprogrammed Captain America persuaded Baron Zemo to have the Masters of Evil join HYDRA&#x27;s &quot;Army of Evil.&quot; Baron Zemo did just that. The Masters of Evil assisted the Army of Evil in causing havoc in protest for what happened at Pleasant Hill.

===Doctor Octopus&#x27; Masters of Evil===
The fifth incarnation was organized by Doctor Octopus, but bore little resemblance to previous incarnations. Its roster included Gargantua, Jackhammer, Oddball, Powderkeg, and Puff Adder, in addition to former members Absorbing Man, Shocker, Titania, and Yellowjacket.

This incarnation initially fought the original Guardians of the Galaxy - a superhero group from an alternate future timeline - but then fought with the Guardians against an army of doppelgangers.

===The Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
====First version====
The seventh incarnation was recruited by the Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer). This version consisted first of the third Cyclone, Flying Tiger, Klaw, Man-Killer, and Tiger Shark, and later expanded to include Aqueduct, Bison, Blackwing, Boomerang, Cardinal, Constrictor, Dragonfly, Eel, Icemaster, Joystick, Lodestone, Man-Ape, Quicksand, Scorcher, Shatterfist, Shockwave, Slyde, Sunstroke, and Supercharger.

====Second version====
The eighth incarnation, led by the Crimson Cowl, consisted of Black Mamba, Cardinal, Cyclone, Gypsy Moth, Hydro-Man, Machinesmith, and Man-Killer.

Both versions of the Crimson Cowl&#x27;s Masters of Evil sought to master and control Earth&#x27;s superhuman mercenaries. They even tried to get the Thunderbolts to join them.

===The Shadow Council&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
Max Fury of the Shadow Council forms a ninth incarnation of the Masters of Evil, consisting of Princess Python, Vengeance, and Whiplash. They were discovered by the Secret Avengers during a mission run by Captain America and Hawkeye. Max Fury later recruits Black Talon, the Brothers Grimm, Carrion, Constrictor, Crossfire, Diablo, Firebrand, Griffin, Killer Shrike, Lady Stilt-Man, Pink Pearl, and Squid to join the Shadow Council&#x27;s Masters of Evil. Fury and the Masters of Evil capture John Steele after he attempts to escape Bagalia with the Serpent Crown and the Crown of Thorns. In order for the Masters of Evil to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the Shadow Council, Fury hired the Taskmaster to retrieve it. The Taskmaster demanded more money for the job and he hid in the Hole (a bar located in an underground city in Bagalia). Upon claiming the Crown of Wolves, Fury was unable to harness its power because he is a Life Model Decoy. When the Taskmaster donned the Crown of Wolves, he was unable to control the powers of the Abyss. Under the control of the Abyss, the Masters of Evil and the other people in Bagalia make their move. The Secret Avengers fight to keep the people under control of the Abyss from leaving Bagalia and invading other countries to spread the possession to other people. While possessed by the Abyss, Taskmaster used its power to take control of the villains and have them board an airplane out of Bagalia to spread the campaign of the Abyss. While the others fight the possessed villains and other people, Venom uses his symbiote to break the Crowns and capture the Taskmaster.

When the second incarnation of the Secret Avengers raid Bagalia to free the Taskmaster, they have to fight through the Masters of Evil. During this time, it is shown that Bi-Beast, Madcap, Ringer, and a number of other supervillains have joined the Masters of Evil.

The Masters of Evil are featured in &quot;Avengers Undercover&quot; as part of the second wave of comics that are part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; branding. Following the death of Max Fury, Baron Helmut Zemo had been sworn in as the new leader of the Masters of Evil. He is shown to have Madame Masque as his right-hand woman, has Constrictor as his bodyguard, and Daimon Hellstrom is in their company as their magic expert. The Anachronism, Cammi, Chase Stein, Death Locket, Hazmat, and Nico Minoru teleport to Bagalia in disguise and locate Cullen Bloodstone at the Hole, a Bagalian bar owned by Arcade. After a fight with the villains there, Cullen reveals that he has become a member of the Masters of Evil, having been accepted by them. Constrictor and Madam Masque arrange for Cullen to teleport the group to a nearby swanky party at Massacrer Casino hosted by Arcade so that they can get revenge on him once and for all. Zemo, Masque, Constrictor, and Hellstrom watch as the young heroes try to avoid being killed, as Arcade has arranged the party at Massacrer Casino as the testing grounds for his newest version of &quot;Murderworld&quot;: fancy parties at casinos where the rich and powerful can try and kill each other to prove their supremacy. After Arcade was killed, Zemo, Masque, Constrictor, and Hellstrom begin plotting their next move regarding the heroes. After the young heroes are apprehended during a S.H.I.E.L.D. raid on Bagalia, Hellstrom later teleports the S.H.I.E.L.D. lair back to Bagalia, where Zemo offers the group a chance to join the Masters of Evil. Zemo instructs Constrictor, Hellstrom, and Masque to take a portion of the Murderworld survivors and take them into Bagalia City. While the other young heroes take up Zemo&#x27;s offer to join the Masters of Evil (with a plan to take the group down from within), Cammi is the only one to decline. Zemo hears that she is the only one not joining and says that they will respect her choice. Cammi flies away, only to be caught by Constrictor and slammed into a rock wall.

===Lightmaster&#x27;s Masters of Evil===
While the Shadow Council had their version, Lightmaster assembles a more traditional lineup (10th incarnation) when he and his henchmen, the Wrecking Crew, encounter of the Superior Spider-Man and his Superior Six while attacking Alchemax and attempting to steal its technology during a plot to blackmail New York City for money. Besides the Wrecking Crew, this roster includes the Absorbing Man, Titania, Mister Hyde, Whirlwind, and Blackout.

===West Coast version===
To combat the West Coast Avengers, Madame Masque formed a West Coast version of the Masters of Evil consisting of the Eel, Graviton, Lady Bullseye, MODOK Superior, Satana, and Kate Bishop&#x27;s parents Derek and Eleanor Bishop.

===Multiversal Masters of Evil===
When the Prehistoric Avengers fought a younger Thanos and sent him back to the future, Mephisto found out that an alternate version of Doctor Doom called Doom Supreme had witnessed this fight. Mephisto suggested to Doom Supreme to form a team of evil villains that would take on the Avengers. As a condition from the Council of Red, Doom Supreme is to save Earth-616 for last. He formed a Multiverse version of the Masters of Evil that consisted of Black Skull, Dark Phoenix, Ghost Goblin, Kid Thanos, and King Killmonger.
