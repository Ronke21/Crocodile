<text>The Phrygians (Greek: Φρύγες, &quot;Phruges&quot; or &quot;Phryges&quot;) were an ancient Indo-European speaking people who inhabited central-western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey) in antiquity. 

Ancient Greek authors used &quot;Phrygian&quot; as an umbrella term to describe a vast ethno-cultural complex located mainly in the central areas of Anatolia rather than a name of a single &quot;tribe&quot; or &quot;people&quot;, and its ethno-linguistic homogeneity is debatable. Phrygians were initially dwelling in the southern Balkans – according to Herodotus – under the name of Bryges (Briges), changing it to Phryges after their final migration to Anatolia, via the Hellespont. Many historians support a Phrygian migration from Europe to Asia Minor BC, although Anatolian archaeologists have generally abandoned the idea. It has been suggested that the Phrygian migration to Asia Minor, mentioned in Greek sources to have occurred shortly after the Trojan War, happened much earlier, and in many stages. 

Phrygia developed an advanced Bronze Age culture. The earliest traditions of Greek music are in part connected to Phrygian music, transmitted through the Greek colonies in Anatolia, especially the Phrygian mode, which was considered to be the warlike mode in ancient Greek music. Phrygian Midas, the king of the &quot;golden touch&quot;, was tutored in music by Orpheus himself, according to the myth. Another musical invention that came from Phrygia was the aulos, a reed instrument with two pipes. In classical Greek iconography Paris, a Trojan, is represented as non-Greek by his Phrygian cap, which was also worn by Mithras and survived into modern imagery as the &quot;Liberty cap&quot; of the American and French revolutionaries.

Phrygians spoke the Phrygian language, a member of the Indo-European linguistic family. Modern consensus regards Greek as its closest relative.

==History==

A conventional date of c. 1180 BC is often used for the influx (traditionally from Thrace) of the pre-Phrygian Bryges or Mushki, corresponding to the very end of the Hittite Empire. Following this date, Phrygia retained a separate cultural identity. From tribal and village beginnings, the state of Phrygia arose in the 8th century BC with its capital at Gordium. Around 690 BC, it was invaded by the Cimmerians. Phrygia was briefly conquered by its neighbour Lydia, before it passed successively into the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great and later the empire of Alexander and his successors. Later, it was taken by the Attalids of Pergamon, and eventually became part of the Roman Empire. The last mention of the Phrygian language in literature dates to the 5th century AD and it was likely extinct by the 7th century.

===Migration===
After the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the beginning of the twelfth century BC, the political vacuum in central-western Anatolia was filled by a wave of Indo-European migrants and &quot;Sea Peoples&quot;, including the Phrygians, who established their kingdom with a capital eventually at Gordium. It is presently unknown whether the Phrygians were actively involved in the collapse of the Hittite capital Hattusa or whether they simply moved into the vacuum left by the collapse of Hittite hegemony. The so-called Handmade Knobbed Ware was found by archaeologists at sites from this period in Western Anatolia. According to Greek mythographers, Midas had been king of the Phrygians, who were originally called the Bryges (Brigi) and came from the western part of archaic Thrace or Macedon. Midas has been linked to the Mushki king Mita. However, the origins of the Mushki, and their connection to the Phrygians, is uncertain. Some scholars have suggested that Mita was a Luwian name (it was recorded in Asia Minor in the 15th century BC).

Though the migration theory is still defended by many modern historians, most archaeologists have abandoned the migration hypothesis regarding the origin of the Phrygians due to a lack substantial archeological evidence, with the migration theory resting only on the accounts of Herodotus and Xanthus.

===8th to 7th centuries===
Assyrian sources from the 8th century BC speak of a king Mita of the Mushki, identified with king Midas of Phrygia. An Assyrian inscription records Mita as an ally of Sargon of Assyria in 709 BC. A distinctive Phrygian pottery called Polished Ware appears in the 8th century BC. The Phrygians founded a powerful kingdom which lasted until the Lydian ascendancy (7th century BC). Under kings alternately named Gordias and Midas, the independent Phrygian kingdom of the 8th and 7th centuries BC maintained close trade contacts with her neighbours in the east and the Greeks in the west. Phrygia seems to have been able to co-exist with whatever power was dominant in eastern Anatolia at the time.

The invasion of Anatolia in the late 8th century BC to early 7th century BC by the Cimmerians was to prove fatal to independent Phrygia. Cimmerian pressure and attacks culminated in the suicide of its last king, Midas, according to legend. Gordium fell to the Cimmerians in 696 BC and was sacked and burnt, as reported much later by Herodotus.

A series of digs have opened Gordium as one of Turkey&#x27;s most revealing archeological sites. Excavations confirm a violent destruction of Gordion around 675 BC. A tomb of the Midas period, popularly identified as the &quot;Tomb of Midas&quot; revealed a wooden structure deeply buried under a vast tumulus, containing grave goods, a coffin, furniture, and food offerings (Archaeological Museum, Ankara). The Gordium site contains a considerable later building program, perhaps by Alyattes, the Lydian king, in the 6th century BC.

Minor Phrygian kingdoms continued to exist after the end of the Phrygian empire, and the Phrygian art and culture continued to flourish. Cimmerian people stayed in Anatolia but do not appear to have created a kingdom of their own. The Lydians repulsed the Cimmerians in the 620s, and Phrygia was subsumed into a short-lived Lydian empire. The eastern part of the former Phrygian empire fell into the hands of the Medes in 585 BC.

===Croesus&#x27; Lydian Empire===
Under the proverbially rich King Croesus (reigned 560–546 BC), Phrygia remained part of the Lydian empire that extended east to the Halys River. There may be an echo of strife with Lydia and perhaps a veiled reference to royal hostages, in the legend of the twice-unlucky Adrastus, the son of a King Gordias with the queen, Eurynome. He accidentally killed his brother and exiled himself to Lydia, where King Croesus welcomed him. Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus&#x27; son and then committed suicide.

===Post-state history===
Lydian Croesus was conquered by Cyrus in 546 BC, and Phrygia passed under Persian dominion. After Darius became Persian Emperor in 521 BC, he remade the ancient trade route into the Persian &quot;Royal Road&quot; and instituted administrative reforms that included setting up satrapies (provinces). In the 5th century, Phrygia was made into two administrative provinces, that of Hellespontine Phrygia (or Lesser Phrygia), with its provincial capital established at Dascylium, and the province of Greater Phrygia.

==Culture==

=== Language ===

The Phrygian language is a member of the Indo-European linguistic family with its exact position within it having been debated due to the fragmentary nature of its evidence. Though from what is available it is evident that Phrygian shares important features with Greek and Armenian. Phrygian is part of the centum group of Indo-European languages. However, between the 19th and the first half of the 20th century Phrygian was mostly considered a satəm language, and thus closer to Armenian and Thracian, while today it is commonly considered to be a centum language and thus closer to Greek. The reason that in the past Phrygian had the guise of a satəm language was due to two secondary processes that affected it. Namely, Phrygian merged the old labiovelar with the plain velar, and secondly, when in contact with palatal vowels /e/ and /i/, especially in initial position, some consonants became palatalized. Furthermore, Kortlandt (1988) presented common sound changes of Thracian and Armenian and their separation from Phrygian and the rest of the palaeo-Balkan languages from an early stage.

Modern consensus regards Greek as the closest relative of Phrygian, a position that is supported by Brixhe, Neumann, Matzinger, Woodhouse, Ligorio, Lubotsky, and Obrador-Cursach. Furthermore, 34 out of the 36 Phrygian isoglosses that are recorded are shared with Greek, with 22 being exclusive between them. The last 50 years of Phrygian scholarship developed a hypothesis that proposes a proto-Graeco-Phrygian stage out of which Greek and Phrygian originated, and if Phrygian was more sufficiently attested, that stage could perhaps be reconstructed.

=== Archaeology ===
Based on an extremely slight archaeological record, some scholars such as Nicholas Hammond and Eugene N. Borza suggested that the Phrygians were members of the Lusatian culture that migrated into the southern Balkans during the Late Bronze Age. Many historians support a Phrygian migration from Europe to Asia Minor BC; though, Anatolian archaeologists have generally abandoned the idea due to lack of western (European) ceramic ware, and the continuation of the pre-Bronze Age collapse pottery styles in central Asia Minor. It has been suggested that the Phrygian migration to Asia Minor, mentioned in Greek sources to have occurred shortly after the Trojan War, happened much earlier, and in many stages.

=== Religion ===

The Phrygians worshipped the goddess Cybele. In their language it was known as , and was also referred to as (from which the Greek and Latin derive) or . In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long belted dress, a &quot;polos&quot; (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of Phidias, the sculptor Agoracritus, and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele&#x27;s expanding following, both in the Aegean world and at Rome. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the &quot;tympanon&quot;, a circular frame drum, similar to a tambourine.

The Phrygians also venerated Sabazios, the sky and father-god depicted on horseback. Although the Greeks associated Sabazios with Zeus, representations of him, even at Roman times, show him as a horseman god. His conflicts with the indigenous Mother Goddess, whose creature was the Lunar Bull, may be surmised in the way that Sabazios&#x27; horse places a hoof on the head of a bull, in a Roman relief at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Obrador-Cursach (2020) analysed a new Phrygian inscription from Dorylaion, that mentions the gods , and the . Other attested deities in the Phrygian corpus are , ; and borrowed deities , (possibly a moon god) and .

== Mythological accounts ==
The name of the earliest known mythical king was Nannacus (aka Annacus). This king resided at Iconium, the most eastern city of the kingdom of Phrygia at that time, and after his death, at the age of 300 years, a great flood overwhelmed the country, as had been foretold by an ancient oracle. The next king mentioned in extant classical sources was called Manis or Masdes. According to Plutarch, because of his splendid exploits, great things were called &quot;manic&quot; in Phrygia. Thereafter the kingdom of Phrygia seems to have become fragmented among various kings. One of the kings was Tantalus who ruled over the north western region of Phrygia around Mount Sipylus. Tantalus was endlessly punished in Tartarus, because he allegedly killed his son Pelops and sacrificially offered him to the Olympians, a reference to the suppression of human sacrifice. Tantalus was also falsely accused of stealing from the lotteries he had invented. In the mythic age before the Trojan War, during a time of an interregnum, Gordius (or Gordias), a Phrygian farmer, became king, fulfilling an oracular prophecy. The kingless Phrygians had turned for guidance to the oracle of Sabazios (&quot;Zeus&quot; to the Greeks) at Telmissus, in the part of Phrygia that later became part of Galatia. They had been instructed by the oracle to acclaim as their king the first man who rode up to the god&#x27;s temple in a cart. That man was Gordias (Gordios, Gordius), a farmer, who dedicated the ox-cart in question, tied to its shaft with the &quot;Gordian Knot&quot;. Gordias refounded a capital at Gordium in west central Anatolia, situated on the old trackway through the heart of Anatolia that became Darius&#x27;s Persian &quot;Royal Road&quot; from Pessinus to Ancyra, and not far from the River Sangarius.

Later mythic kings of Phrygia were alternately named Gordias and Midas. Myths surround the first king Midas. There were seven altogether connecting him with a mythological tale concerning Attis. This shadowy figure resided at Pessinus and attempted to marry his daughter to the young Attis in spite of the opposition of his mother figure Agdestis and his lover, the goddess Cybele. When Agdestis or Cybele appear and cast madness upon the members of the wedding feast. Midas is said to have died in the ensuing chaos.

The famous king Midas was said to be a son of the kind Gordius mentioned above. He is said to have associated himself with Silenus and other satyrs and with Dionysus, who granted him the famous &quot;golden touch&quot;.

The mythic Midas of Thrace, accompanied by a band of his people, traveled to Asia Minor to wash away the taint of his unwelcome &quot;golden touch&quot; in the river Pactolus. Leaving the gold in the river&#x27;s sands, Midas found himself in Phrygia, where he was adopted by the childless king Gordias and taken under the protection of Cybele. Acting as the visible representative of Cybele, and under her authority, it would seem, a Phrygian king could designate his successor.

According to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Phrygians were Trojan allies during the Trojan War. The Phrygia of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; appears to be located in the area that embraced the Ascanian lake and the northern flow of the Sangarius river and so was much more limited in extent than classical Phrygia. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; also includes a reminiscence by the Trojan king Priam, who had in his youth come to aid the Phrygians against the Amazons (&quot;Iliad&quot; 3.189). During this episode (a generation before the Trojan War), the Phrygians were said to be led by Otreus and Mygdon. Both appear to be little more than eponyms: there was a place named Otrea on the Ascanian Lake, in the vicinity of the later Nicaea; and the Mygdones were a people of Asia Minor, who resided near Lake Dascylitis (there was also a Mygdonia in Macedonia). During the Trojan War, the Phrygians sent forces to aid Troy, led by Ascanius and Phorcys, the sons of Aretaon. Asius, son of Dymas and brother of Hecabe, is another Phrygian noble who fought before Troy. Quintus Smyrnaeus mentions another Phrygian prince, named Coroebus, son of Mygdon, who fought and died at Troy; he had sued for the hand of the Trojan princess Cassandra in marriage. King Priam&#x27;s wife Hecabe is usually said to be of Phrygian birth, as a daughter of King Dymas.

The Phrygian Sibyl was the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Phrygia.

Marsyas, a Phrygian follower of Cybele, was a satyr who is regarded as the inventor of the aulos, which he created using the hollowed antler of a stag. He unwisely competed in music with the Olympian Apollo and inevitably lost, whereupon Apollo flayed Marsyas alive and provocatively hung his skin on Cybele&#x27;s own sacred tree, a pine.

Herodotus claims the priests of Hephaestus told him a story that the Egyptian pharaoh Psammetichus had two children raised in isolation in order to find the original language. The children were reported to have uttered &quot;bekos&quot; meaning &quot;bread&quot; in Phrygian. It was then acknowledged by the Egyptians that the Phrygians were a nation older than the Egyptians.

Josephus claimed the Phrygians were founded by the biblical figure Togarmah, grandson of Japheth and son of Gomer: &quot;and Thrugramma the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were named Phrygians&quot;.

<text>Jean Henri Todt (; born 25 February 1946) is a French motor racing executive and former rally co-driver. He was previously director of Peugeot Talbot Sport and then Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 team principal, before being appointed chief executive officer of Ferrari from 2004 to 2008. From 2009 to 2021 he served as the ninth president of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA).

In 1966, Todt started his career as a rally co-driver and participated in World Championship rallies until 1981 when, with Guy Fréquelin, he won the Constructors&#x27; World Rally Championship with Talbot Lotus. Under Todt&#x27;s leadership, Peugeot won four World Rally Championship titles (drivers and manufacturers), won the Paris-Dakar Rally four times, and twice won the Le Mans 24 Hours. During his time in charge at Ferrari, their teams won 13 Formula One World Championship titles (drivers and manufacturers). Also under Todt&#x27;s leadership, Michael Schumacher won five consecutive World Drivers&#x27; Championships, from 2000 to 2004, and 72 of his 91 victories.

In October 2009, Todt was elected President of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA); he was re-elected in December 2013 and December 2017. Todt&#x27;s most recent term as FIA President ended in December 2021. On 29 April 2015, Todt had been appointed the United Nations&#x27; Special Envoy for Road Safety.

==Life and career==
Jean Todt was born in Pierrefort, a southern Cantal village in the Auvergne region of France.

After high school, Todt studied at the Ecole des Cadres School of Economics and Business in Paris.

===Rally co-driver: 1966 to 1981===

The young Todt was fascinated by motorsport and had special respect for drivers like Jim Clark and Dan Gurney. Borrowing his parents&#x27; Mini Cooper to drive in rallies, he soon decided his greatest strength was as a co-driver. He first co-drove with Guy Chasseuil in 1966 and his talent for calculation, strategy and organisation quickly made him a sought-after navigator. By 1969, Todt was involved with world-class rally stars such as Jean-Pierre Nicolas, Rauno Aaltonen, Ove Andersson, Hannu Mikkola and Guy Fréquelin. He went on to enjoy success as a co-driver with Jean-François Piot, Ove Andersson, Achim Warmbold, Jean Guichet, Hannu Mikkola, Jean-Claude Lefèbvre, Timo Mäkinen, Jean-Pierre Nicolas and Guy Fréquelin.

In 1981, as Guy Fréquelin&#x27;s co-driver with Talbot, a Peugeot subsidiary, he won the manufacturers’ World Rally Championship and was runner-up in the drivers&#x27; World Rally Championship. At the same time, he was increasingly moving out from his role as a co-driver by participating in the management of the team and in relations with the FIA.

He also represented the drivers in the FISA (Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile) Rally Commission from 1975 to 1981.

===Director of Peugeot Talbot Sport: 1982 to 1993===
In 1981, Todt retired from competing as a co-driver and was appointed Director of Racing for Peugeot by CEO Jean Boillot at a time when PSA Peugeot Citroën was experiencing major financial difficulties as well as image problems. He applied his abilities as an organiser and strategist to the creation of Peugeot Talbot Sport, which he set up to spearhead the firm&#x27;s return to competition. He was the mastermind behind the Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, Peugeot 405 Turbo 16 and Peugeot 905.
In 1984, Peugeot returned to the World Rally Championship and, in 1985 and 1986, the Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 Group B driven first by Timo Salonen then by Juha Kankkunen obtained back-to-back manufacturers&#x27; World Championship titles. In 1986 Henri Toivonen died driving a Lancia Delta S4 during the Tour de Corse rally and the FIA decided to drop the Group B class as being too fast and too dangerous.
In 1987, Todt adapted the 205 Turbo 16 to off-road rallies with the aim of competing in the showcase Paris-Dakar Rally. He became the centre of attention in the 1989 Paris-Dakar when he tossed a coin to decide between his two drivers Ari Vatanen and Jacky Ickx to ensure that their rivalry would not lead to one of them quitting and costing the team victory. From 1987 to 1990, he oversaw four successive victories in the Paris-Dakar with Vatanen and Juha Kankkunen. Peugeot subsequently decided to withdraw from off-road rallying and left the field open to Citroën who won the event with the Citroën ZX Rallye-Raid, based on the Peugeot 405 chassis.
In 1992, Todt won the Le Mans 24 Hours with the Peugeot 905 driven by Derek Warwick, Yannick Dalmas and Mark Blundell and, in 1993, again at Le Mans, three 905 cars driven by Geoff Brabham, Christophe Bouchut and Éric Hélary achieved a 1-2-3 victory.

===General Manager of Scuderia Ferrari: 1994 to 2007===

In 1993, at the age of 47, Todt&#x27;s 12 years with Peugeot Talbot Sport came to an end. He was recruited by Luca di Montezemolo, the new CEO of Scuderia Ferrari. On 1 July of that year at the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours, he started as the General Manager of the Racing Division at the head of a team of 400 technicians.

He was the first non-Italian since Marco Piccinini to head the Scuderia. His challenge was to lead Ferrari back to success at a time when the team was experiencing some of the worst days in its history. The Italian team was undermined by internal quarrels and a production system that was partly delocalised. The Scuderia had won no driver&#x27;s championship since 1979. Todt set about restructuring the management of the Racing Division.

In 1994, barely a year after Todt took up the challenge, Gerhard Berger won the German Grand Prix (Ferrari&#x27;s first win in four years). Even so, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton-Ford (world champion in 1994 and 1995) and the Williams-Renault cars of Ayrton Senna, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and David Coulthard largely dominated the competition.

At the end of the 1995 season, Todt asked the German double world champion Michael Schumacher to join the Scuderia.

In 1996, after winning the Spanish Grand Prix early on the season, Schumacher won two consecutive victories in first the Belgian and then the Italian Grand Prix. Todt then hired two former Benetton managers, the designer and aerodynamics specialist Rory Byrne and technical director Ross Brawn, to replace John Barnard.

In 1997 and 1998 Ferrari missed out on the world drivers&#x27; title by a few points during the final races of the season, in 1997 behind Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams-Renault and in 1998 and 1999 behind Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren-Mercedes, mainly because of Schumacher&#x27;s early season injury at Silverstone in the British GP.

However, Todt achieved his goal of reviving Ferrari by winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Ferrari in 1999, despite Schumacher&#x27;s injury. Starting in 2000, Schumacher would win the next five consecutive world championships through 2004, and six straight Constructors&#x27; Championships. This was the most dominant a team had ever been in Formula One, and a first in the history of the sport until Mercedes began its run of dominance from 2014 to 2020.

===CEO and Special Advisor at Ferrari: 2004 to 2009===
On 1 June 2004, Todt was appointed CEO of Ferrari in addition to his title of General Manager of the Racing Division. In October 2006, three days after the end of the Formula One season which they had almost won again in a tight battle with Renault and Fernando Alonso, and following the retirement of Michael Schumacher, Todt took up a new post as a Special Advisor for Scuderia Ferrari.

In 2007, he prepared the ground for Stefano Domenicali to succeed him as head of the Scuderia on 1 January 2008. Then, on 18 March 2008, he resigned his position as Special Advisor to the Ferrari board, to be replaced by Amedeo Felisa. He nonetheless remained a member of the board of Ferrari for a further year before resigning all his functions within the Italian firm in March 2009.

===President of FIA===
In April 2009, Todt became President of &quot;eSafety Aware!&quot; for the promotion of smart vehicles and new safety technologies, which enabled him to improve his knowledge of the internal workings of the FIA.

On 16 July 2009, he officially announced his intention of running for the Presidency of the FIA in the election that was due to take place in October. The day before, he had received the support of outgoing President Max Mosley, who had decided not to stand for re-election. He was the second contender to declare, the 1981 world rally champion Ari Vatanen having announced his candidature just a few days earlier.

On 23 October 2009, he was elected President of the FIA (for what would become his first term) gaining 135 votes in comparison to Vatanen&#x27;s 49. He was re-elected, unchallenged, for a second four-year term on 6 December 2013, and was again re-elected, unopposed, for a third four-year term on 8 December 2017. His FIA presidency ended in December 2021, with the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix being the last race which he would attend as president. He was later succeeded by Mohammed Ben Sulayem.

===UN Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Envoy===

Since April 29, 2015, Todt has been Special Envoy for Road Safety to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The new UN Secretary-General António Guterres confirmed him in this role in April 2017.

===Other activities===
Todt also devotes his time to several charitable causes. He is one of the founders and the vice-president of the Institut du cerveau et de la moelle épinière (ICM), an institute devoted to medical research for brain and spinal cord disorders, which was set up in 2005. He has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society since 2009, President of the Board of Directors of the Suu Foundation since December 2014, Tourism Ambassador for Malaysia (2009–2015) and member of the board of directors for the International Peace Institute (IPI) since June 2015. He has been a member of the IOC&#x27;s Commission for Public Affairs and Social Development through Sport since April 2017.

Since January 2018, he has been a board member of the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens.

He also sits on the boards of Gaumont, the Groupe Lucien Barrière and Edmond de Rothschild SA.

Since 2003, Todt has been an Honorary President of the Federazione Auto Motoristica Sammarinese (FAMS) and Ambassador of the Republic of San Marino.

He is also an honorary member of the Automobile Club de France and of the Polo de Paris.

<doc id="695696" wikidata="Q897381" url="?curid=695696" title="Braille music">
<text>Braille music is a braille code that allows music to be notated using braille cells so music can be read by visually impaired musicians. The system was incepted by Louis Braille.

Braille music uses the same six-position braille cell as literary braille. However braille music assigns its own meanings and has its own syntax and abbreviations. Almost anything that can be written in print music notation can be written in braille music notation. However, the notation is an independent and well-developed system with its own conventions.

The world&#x27;s largest collection of the notation is at the Library of Congress in the United States.

== Learning Braille music ==
Braille music, as with print music, uses a notation system to transcribe the notes, rhythm, and other aspects of a piece of music. Because blind musicians may need both hands to play their instrument, braille music is designed to ease the memorization of a score. Some aspects of the system are therefore more logical or simplified compared to print music; for example, identifying Middle C requires simply reading the written note rather than understanding where it falls on a staff. Visually impaired musicians can begin learning braille music about the time they have reasonable competence reading literary braille.

=== Teaching Braille music ===
Braille music for beginners, like print music for beginners, is quite simple. Music teachers with no previous knowledge of braille music can easily learn the rudiments of braille music notation and keep a step or two ahead of the student who is learning braille music. Some common print method books have a version in braille so both books can be used alongside each other.

=== Transcribing music into Braille ===
Many standard works for some genres, for each instrument appear in braille. In the US, they are available from the National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS) of the Library of Congress (free for qualified people) and elsewhere. Most countries have a similar national library.

However, many visually impaired musicians need music that has never before been transcribed to braille music. In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other countries a network of braille music transcribers transcribe such music.

Another option is to use a braille-output computer-music system. Most such software automatically converts print notation (sheet music) into braille. While Goodfeel is the oldest and best known braille music translator, there are now other options, including BrailleMUSE, Sao Mai Braille, among others.

== Introduction to Braille music symbols and syntax ==
Some of the most common braille music symbols and combinations are summarized in the chart below. Note that the notes follow the do-re-mi mnemonic, with &quot;do&quot; (that is, C) abbreviated &#x27;d&#x27;, and the other notes following alphabetically from there, so that C is written &#x27;d&#x27;, D is written &#x27;e&#x27;, E is &#x27;f&#x27;, F is &#x27;g&#x27;, G is &#x27;h&#x27;, A is &#x27;i&#x27; and B is &#x27;j&#x27;. 

=== Pitch and rhythm ===
As the table below shows, each symbol shows the pitch and choice of two rhythmic lengths of a note which will be context-clear. The notes are noted in dots 1, 2, 4, and 5, while rhythm is noted in dots 3 and 6. Braille aligned the notes with the solfège system, so the note C uses the letter &#x27;d&#x27; (dots 1,4,5) for &quot;do&quot;. In the full scale, C-D-E-F-G-A-B use the same Braille characters as the letters d-e-f-g-h-i-j. Without dot 3 or 6, the indicated note is an eighth note (quaver). With dot 6, it is a quarter note; dot 3, a half note; and dots 3,6, a whole note. Every rhythm symbol does double up in meaning: 8th notes match 128th notes; quarter notes (crotchets) match 64th notes; half notes match 32nd notes; and whole notes match 16th notes (semiquavers). Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes). For advanced users no rhythmic ambiguity arises as the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear. For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), those facts clarify that the symbol is a whole rest.

=== Octave marks ===
An octave mark is included before the first note to specify its octave and when it changes unexpectedly. For instance, the 4th Octave is the octave starting with middle C and going up to the B above middle C. A melody clearly proceeding upward from the first octave can, if moving by step, proceed to the second, third, and fourth octaves without requiring additional octave signs. The rule is that, save for an octave mark specifying otherwise, notes move by a unison/no change, 2nd, or 3rd rather than a 6th, 7th, or octave. For instance, the following moves upward continuously, ending in octave 5:

:Octave 2 C C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B B C C

The rule for 4ths and 5ths is more conservative. Save for an octave sign specifying otherwise, any melodic leap of a 4th or 5th stays in the same octave as the previous note. For instance, this always stays within Octave 2:

:Octave 2 C G D A E B F C G D A E

Because of the use of octave marks, clef symbols are not required in braille music. On occasion, clef symbols (bass clef, treble clef, or other) will be given so the visually impaired musician will be aware of every detail of the print score.

=== Musical markings ===
Musical indications like diminuendo, crescendo, or ritardando are inserted inline with the note and rhythm notation and, to differentiate them from note, octave, and other musical signs, always preceded by the &quot;word sign&quot; (dots 3,4,5). See the table below for some examples:

Slurs may be indicated by a slur sign between two notes or bracket slur surrounding a group of notes to be slurred.

Musical signs such as staccato or tenuto are generally placed before the note or chord they affect. The musical signs in the table below are shown modifying a quarter note C (dots 1,4,5,6):

&quot;Music hyphen&quot; states that a measure will be continued on the next line (this happens somewhat more often in braille music than in print music).

A &quot;word apostrophe&quot; indicates that the word will be continued on the following line.

Fingering marks are shown in the table below:

=== Repetition symbols ===
Braille music tends to be rather bulky. Because of this, a system of repetition symbols—much more extensive than that in print music—exists to reduce page turns, size of scores, and expense of printing.

The repetition symbol (dots 2,3,5,6) is used like the printed intra-bar symbol to indicate that a beat, half measure, or full measure is to be repeated.

In addition, braille music often includes instructions such as &quot;repeat measure 2 here&quot; or &quot;repeat measures 5–7 here&quot;. Such are in addition to the commonly used repeat marks and first and second endings.

=== Contrapuntal lines and chords within a staff ===
Unlike print music notation, braille music is a linear format. Therefore, certain conventions must be used to indicate contrapuntal lines and chords (where more than one note is played simultaneously within a staff).

==== In-accords ====
Independent contrapuntal lines within a staff are indicated via whole- or part-measure in-accords. The first of the contrapuntal lines is given, then the second, enclosed by the in-accord symbols. The in-accord symbols indicate that the two lines are to be played simultaneously.

==== Interval notation ====
Homophonic chordal sections are written using interval notation. For instance, the notation &quot;quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th&quot; would indicate playing a C along with the notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length. Reading the interval notation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some staves use bottom-up notation (the bottom note of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note). The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate. For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the bottom note and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down. Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down. Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation. However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context. By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation. Thus, examining the in-accords is a key to unlock which reading applies.

=== Dealing with different staves ===
Printed music is often written on simultaneous staves. For instance, piano music is typically written on two which compose the grand staff: one for treble clef (which soprano singers use) and one for bass clef. Standard choral work uses this mainly where they do not cross or four where they do, as for string quartet music (the most common added clefs are alto and/or tenor). The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music and the fact that the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. &quot;Bar over bar format&quot; is most similar to print music with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line. Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are: &quot;line over line format&quot;, &quot;section by section format&quot;; &quot;paragraph style&quot;; and &quot;bar by bar format&quot;. As a rule these take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part. No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9–16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used. However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.

== Variations in Braille music ==
Over the years and in the many different countries, a variety of minor differences in braille music practice have arisen. Some have preferred a different standard for interval or staff notation or used different codes for various less common musical notations. An international effort to standardize the braille music code culminated in updates summarized in the Music Braille Code 1997 and detailed in New International Manual of Braille Music Notation (1997) However, users should be aware that they will encounter divergences when ordering scores from printing houses and libraries because these are often older and from various countries.

<doc id="695697" wikidata="Q173140" url="?curid=695697" title="Ross Brawn">
<text>Ross James Brawn (born 23 November 1954) is a British Formula One managing director, motor sports and technical director. He is a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal, and has worked for a number of Formula One teams. Teams with Brawn in an essential role have won eight constructors&#x27; championships and eight drivers&#x27; championships in total. Serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams, he earned fame as the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind Michael Schumacher&#x27;s seven world championship titles. He took a sabbatical in 2007 and returned to F1 for the 2008 season as team principal of Honda.

Brawn acquired the Honda team in early 2009 to form the Brawn GP team, which won the Formula One Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; Championships in that year. Mercedes bought into the team in November 2009, making Brawn team principal and co-owner with Nick Fry. In 2011, Brawn and Fry sold the remaining shares to Mercedes Benz, with Brawn remaining as team principal. In November 2013, it was announced that Brawn would step down, and leadership would be handed over to Paddy Lowe and Toto Wolff. Following speculation linking him with other teams, Brawn announced his retirement from Formula One in February 2014.

== Early life and family ==
Brawn was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, England. He became interested in engineering during his early years, often visiting Belle Vue Stadium to watch various forms of motor racing. He moved south aged 11 as his father took a job near Reading, Berkshire, and he subsequently attended Reading School in the town. In 1971, he was taken on as a mechanical craft apprentice by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at its Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Harwell, Oxfordshire, where he qualified as an instrument mechanic. He went on to start an HNC in Mechanical Engineering, still funded by Harwell. Living in Reading, he found an advertisement for Frank Williams Grand Prix, which were based in Reading at that time; he was interviewed by Patrick Head. Williams were looking for a milling machinist which was one of the skills he learnt at Harwell.

Brawn lives in Stoke Row, near Henley-on-Thames. In his spare time he enjoys gardening, fishing and listening to music. In 2006, Brawn received an honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering (DEng) from Brunel University for his services to motorsport. On 18 November 2011, Brawn received a second honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University. He is married to Jean.

== Career ==
His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards, he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&amp;D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team&#x27;s wind tunnel.

Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley&#x27;s design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. With the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the Formula One paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the team left Formula One at the end of the season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There, he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the and seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in . Later in 1989, Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

=== Benetton (1991–1996) ===
Later in 1991 Brawn returned to Formula One as technical director of the Benetton team, helping it win consecutive World Drivers&#x27; Championships in 1994 and 1995 with Michael Schumacher, and to take the World Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1995. Despite the car being designed by Rory Byrne, Brawn was credited by much of the specialist press with being an important part of these championships, particularly in terms of devising race strategy. Brawn also persuaded Frank Dernie to join to help with car development and improve the team organisation.

=== Ferrari (1997–2006) ===

Brawn followed Schumacher to Ferrari in late , at the end of Schumacher&#x27;s first year with the team. He was renowned for his race strategies as the team began to challenge for the championship from 1997, despite the superiority of the Williams cars that year and the McLarens from 1998 onwards. After these rebuilding years, as Ferrari technical director, he helped them regain glory when the team won the Constructors&#x27; Championship in , the first of six consecutive titles.

The Brawn-guided Scuderia also powered Schumacher to five consecutive drivers&#x27; titles, from to . Brawn&#x27;s contributions to this unprecedented string of titles has led many to label him as a vital member of the Ferrari &quot;dream team&quot; along with Schumacher, team principal Jean Todt, and chief designer Rory Byrne. In , Ferrari never quite found form, and had to relinquish the title to Renault, and Schumacher passed the crown to Fernando Alonso. In , Ferrari had a poor start to the season but clearly had the fastest car by the end of that season.

On 26 October 2006, Ferrari announced that Brawn was to leave the team. It was believed that he would take a one-year sabbatical to allow other members of the Ferrari technical departments to advance within the team.

=== Honda (2008) ===
Towards the end of 2007, it was reported that Brawn was to join the big-spending Red Bull outfit as part of a package intended to attract double world champion Fernando Alonso. On 12 November 2007, it was announced that Brawn was to become the new team principal of Honda. He started working with the British-based team on 26 November 2007. With the withdrawal of Honda from Formula One announced in late 2008, Brawn was effectively out of the sport unless a buyer could quickly be found. This was unfortunate for Brawn as he believed that the team had a &quot;race-winning car&quot; for 2009.

=== Brawn GP (2009) ===

On 5 March 2009, a 100% buy-out of Honda was completed, with Brawn taking a controlling 54% stake. They announced entry to the 2009 Formula One World Championship under the new name Brawn GP. Minority shareholders were CEO Nick Fry (31%), former Honda finance chief Nigel Kerr (8%), former Honda head of Human Resources John Marsden (3%), former Honda legal counsel Caroline McGrory (3%), and former Honda director Gordon Blair (1%). Many aspects of Honda were retained under the new ownership, including the experienced driver line-up of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button. Brawn GP chose to source their engines for the 2009 season from Mercedes-Benz.

In the first Grand Prix of 2009 in Australia, Button qualified in pole position with Barrichello in second place; they went on to finish in those positions. Of the 17 Grand Prix races of the 2009 season, Button won six and Barrichello won two, while the team finished in both first and second places in four races and in podium positions in eleven races. The Brawn team was given a financial boost on the eve of the Australian Grand Prix when Virgin boss Richard Branson announced he was going to become a team sponsor. The team then got a second sponsor on board, the Swiss brokers MIG Investments. Brawn GP won the 2009 Constructors&#x27; Championship and Button won the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Brawn was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to motorsport.

=== Mercedes (2010–2013) ===
In November 2009, Brawn GP was bought out by Daimler AG, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz. Brawn, as majority shareholder, stood to do very well financially from the deal and remained as team principal. He and Fry kept a 24.9% share in the new team, which was then sold to Daimler AG in early 2011. In December 2009, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher confirmed that the main reason he decided to come out of retirement and drive for Mercedes GP was because of Brawn. It was at Benetton and at Ferrari where Brawn masterminded Schumacher&#x27;s seven world titles. The start of the 2010 season was rather slow, and in the first three races Schumacher managed only sixth in Bahrain, tenth in Australia, and retired in Malaysia because of a lost wheel nut, whilst Schumacher&#x27;s teammate and fellow-countryman Nico Rosberg had a bit more success with the car, finishing fifth in Bahrain and in Australia, and scoring the first podium for Mercedes Grand Prix with a third place in Malaysia.

The team won their first race on 15 April 2012, when Rosberg won the Chinese Grand Prix. The team continued its good run from China with Schumacher qualifying fastest at Monaco, and Rosberg finishing on the podium. Towards the end of the season, the team had some lacklustre results. In the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher announced his retirement from Formula One, and Mercedes announced that the 2008 world champion and McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton was to join their line-up, pairing with Rosberg for the 2013 season.

2013 started much as 2012 had ended for Mercedes, as the pre-season indicated that the car was unreliable, with Rosberg suffering from damage to his exhaust on the first day of testing in Jerez, and Hamilton suffering a brake failure on the second day. As testing continued Mercedes showed signs of pace, particularly in the final Barcelona test. At the first race in Melbourne, both Rosberg and Hamilton qualified well inside the top 10, with Hamilton finishing fifth, whilst Rosberg suffered more problems with his car, eventually retiring. In the second race of the season, Mercedes finished third (Hamilton) and fourth (Rosberg), amid a controversial Malaysian Grand Prix. Brawn spoke to both drivers over team radio asking them to hold position for fear of high degrading Pirelli tyres and a lack of fuel on board both cars. The third race at China established Mercedes&#x27; pace as title contenders when Hamilton took Mercedes&#x27; second pole position in two years at China whilst Rosberg qualified fourth. Hamilton went on to finish in third place but Rosberg again had to retire with an anti-rollbar failure.

Rosberg took pole at the next three Grands Prix and brought Mercedes their first win of the season in Monaco; however, the victory was overshadowed by controversy after Mercedes used a then current car when undertaking a tyre test at the invitation of Pirelli shortly before the Grand Prix. The team were reprimanded by the FIA and banned from a subsequent young drivers&#x27; test but did not lose any championship points. The car continued to perform much better in qualifying than in the race for the rest of the season. Hamilton took four more pole positions and Mercedes won two more races, in Britain (Rosberg) and Hungary (Hamilton). Following multiple tyre failures at the British Grand Prix, Pirelli reverted to the 2012 components after the summer break, which saw Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull win all the remaining races and the championships. Mercedes finished second in the constructors&#x27; championship, while Hamilton and Rosberg finished fourth and fifth in the drivers&#x27; standings.

On 29 October 2013, the BBC reported that Brawn would leave Mercedes at the end of the 2013 season, following disagreement about his role in the team. On 28 November 2013, it was reported that he would leave the team at the end of the year.

===2014 to 2016===

On 1 February 2014, Brawn announced his retirement from Formula One, ending speculation of a possible position at the Woking-based McLaren team. The FIA announced in October 2014 that Brawn would be a member of a 10-strong panel to investigate Jules Bianchi&#x27;s crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix and that the panel would report to the World Motor Sport Council in December.

In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in October 2016, Brawn indicated that he was ready to return to Formula 1, although in a strategic rather than a team role. His book on strategy in Formula 1, &quot;Total Competition&quot;, was released a week later.

=== Formula One Management (2017–2022) ===

On 23 January 2017, it was announced that Ross Brawn was appointed to the newly created role of managing director, Motor Sports, and technical director for the Formula One Group. Following the 2022 season, rumours emerged he may return to Ferrari as team principal. On 28 November 2022, he confirmed he was retiring from Formula One.

== Personal life ==

===Charity work===
In 2010, Brawn, a member of the RNLI, set up the Brawn Lifeboat Challenge to fund a new lifeboat for the River Thames in London. The venture raised £360,000 in 8 months and the new E-class lifeboat &quot;Brawn Challenge&quot; was launched in September 2012. In 2014, he became a patron of Hope for Tomorrow, a charity which provides NHS trusts with mobile cancer care units so that they can provide cancer treatment in local communities.

=== Speeding offence ===
Brawn escaped a driving ban after he admitted speeding at over on a dual carriageway. He was speeding in his Mercedes-Benz E320 Saloon on the 70 mph (112 km/h) limited A30 at Sourton near Okehampton, Devon on 30 May 2009.
Brawn paid a fine of £700, costs of £75, and had his licence endorsed with six points.

<text>25th Hour is a 2002 American drama film directed by Spike Lee and starring Edward Norton. Adapted by David Benioff from his 2001 debut novel &quot;The 25th Hour&quot;, it tells the story of a man&#x27;s last 24 hours of freedom as he prepares to go to prison for seven years for dealing drugs.

&quot;25th Hour&quot; opened to positive reviews, with several critics since having ranked it as one of the best films of its decade and praising its portrayal of New York City after the September 11 attacks. The film was subsequently ranked 26th on the BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list in 2016.

==Plot==

A car pulls up at night on a New York City street. Monty Brogan and his friend Kostya, get out to look at an injured dog lying in the road. Monty intends to perform a mercy kill but changes his mind after looking the dog in the eye.

Opening credits roll with shots of the Tribute in Light floodlights reaching into the sky from the site of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

Years later, Monty is one day away from starting a seven-year prison sentence for drug dealing. On his last day of freedom, he walks the city with Doyle, the dog he rescued, and visits his old high school, where he played varsity basketball as a freshman. Later, he plans to meet childhood friends at a club — Frank Slaugherty , a boorish Wall Street trader, Jacob Elinsky, an introverted high school teacher, and his live-in girlfriend, Naturelle Riviera.

In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested. DEA agents raid Monty&#x27;s apartment and, knowing where to look, quickly find the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs.

Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, funded by Monty&#x27;s drug money. James remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the restroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against New York ethnic groups, against corporate criminals, and against Osama bin Laden before finally turning on himself for stupidly not giving up his drug business before he was caught.

Frank and Jacob meet at Frank&#x27;s apartment overlooking ground zero. Jacob muses about seeing Monty again when he is released in seven years. Frank impatiently tells Jacob that, after this night he will never see Monty again.

In a police interview, agents tell Monty that Naturelle is the one who sold him out. They seek to get him to turn on Nikolai by threatening the prospect of a long prison term, and of prison rape. Monty refuses.

Monty recalls how he met Naturelle when he was hanging around his old high school. He asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.

Outside the club, Jacob sees Mary, a student he is infatuated with. Monty invites her in, although she is underage. Frank and Monty discuss prison. Frank tries to be encouraging, but Monty is convinced he&#x27;ll be a victim of rape and have no future when he&#x27;s released. Mary flirts with Jacob, which causes him to follow her to a bathroom and attempt a kiss, but Mary is frozen in shock and Jacob quickly leaves, considering the consequences. 

Frank accuses Naturelle of living on Monty&#x27;s money despite knowing its origins, and suggests it was she who ratted out Monty. Naturelle slaps him and leaves. 

Monty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai reveals that it was Kostya who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that the mobster was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.

Monty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He again admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly. Frank refuses, but Monty goads him into taking out his frustrations, and is left bruised and bloody, with a broken nose.

Naturelle tries to comfort him as Monty&#x27;s father arrives to take him to Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville. On the drive to prison in upstate New York, Monty again sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city. As they drive up the Henry Hudson Parkway, James suggests they take the George Washington Bridge to go west, into hiding, and gives Monty a vision of a future where he avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. When the vision stops, they are past the bridge, still driving toward the prison.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Benioff completed the book &quot;The 25th Hour&quot; while studying at the University of California Irvine. After he received numerous rejections, it was published in 2001. Six months before that a preliminary trade copy was circulated; actor and producer Tobey Maguire read it and became interested in playing the lead role of Monty Brogan.

He acquired the option for a potential film project and asked Benioff to adapt it as a screenplay. However, after the script was written, Maguire had become too deeply involved with the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film to take on another acting job. But he later served as a producer of &quot;25th Hour&quot;. Spike Lee expressed an interest in directing the film.

Spike Lee was interested in the long monologue that Benioff called the &quot;fuck monologue&quot;, in which Monty ranted against the five boroughs of New York; Benioff had considered leaving it out of the film, but Lee persuaded him to keep it in. Disney picked up the film rights and wanted the monologue cut, but Lee persisted in filming the scene.

The film was in the &quot;planning stages&quot; at the time of the September 11 attacks. Lee &quot;decided not to ignore the tragedy but to integrate it into his story&quot;. The feelings of loss and uncertainty suffuse the film.

==Reception==
&quot;25th Hour&quot; received a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 175 reviews, with an average rating of 7.22/10. The consensus calls the film &quot;an intelligent and well-acted film despite the usual Spike Lee excesses.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 69/100 based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating “generally favorable reviews”.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B− on scale of A to F.

Five years after the September 11 attacks, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;Released 15 months after Sept. 11, 2001, Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;25th Hour&quot; is the only great film dealing with the Sept. 11 tragedy... &quot;25th Hour&quot; is as much an urban historical document as Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;Open City,&quot; filmed in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi occupation of Rome&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list on December 16, 2009. A. O. Scott, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert all placed it on their respective lists for best films of the 2000 decade.

In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics from around the world, it was ranked as the 26th greatest film since 2000.

Monty&#x27;s monologue, or rant, has made many &#x27;top movie rant&#x27; lists.

==Music==
Terence Blanchard composed the film&#x27;s musical score. Other songs that appear in the film (and are not included in the original score) include:

# Big Daddy Kane – &quot;Warm It Up, Kane&quot;
# Craig Mack – &quot;Flava in Ya Ear&quot;
# The Olympic Runners – &quot;Put the Music Where Your Mouth Is&quot;
# Grandmaster Melle Mel – &quot;White Lines (Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Do It)&quot;
# Liquid Liquid – &quot;Cavern&quot;
# Cymande – &quot;Bra&quot;
# Cymande – &quot;Dove&quot;
# Cymande – &quot;The Message&quot;
# Bruce Springsteen – &quot;The Fuse&quot;

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Bingo&quot; makes both visual and verbal references to the film and its source novel, as well as to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Jimmy tells Kim to &quot;Picture &quot;25th Hour&quot;, starring Ned and Maude Flanders&quot;, when he phones Kim to tell her the Kettlemans, one of whom is facing jail time, have hired him to replace Kim as their attorney.

<text>Paul Shanklin (born 1962 in Memphis, Tennessee) is an American conservative political satirist, impressionist, comedian, and conservative speaker. Shanklin wrote and voiced the characters for the songs and satirical comedy segments used by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.

Shanklin first came to media attention after doing his vocal impersonation of then-President of the United States Bill Clinton for Memphis radio show host &quot;The Big Kahuna&quot;, Bill Young. Shanklin was brought to the attention of Limbaugh by announcer Johnny Donovan, and was first featured on Limbaugh&#x27;s show in May 1993.

One of Shanklin&#x27;s most controversial works was his 2007 parody &quot;Barack the Magic Negro&quot;, in which he impersonates Al Sharpton lamenting that white voters will perceive Barack Obama as a &quot;magic negro&quot; and therefore favor Obama for president over him. This was based on a column titled &quot;Obama the &#x27;Magic Negro&#x27;&quot; by black columnist David Ehrenstein in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The inclusion of this song on a CD by Republican National Committee chairman candidate Chip Saltsman in 2008 caused some consternation, resulting in him withdrawing his candidacy.

Shanklin has released a total of 15 albums of political parody and has performed over 1,900 parody songs and skits for Limbaugh incorporating over 80 voice impressions.

<text>Samuel David Michael (born 29 April 1971) is an Australian motor sports engineer and designer, who held senior positions with Formula One constructors Williams and McLaren. He is currently employed by Supercar team Triple Eight Race Engineering.

==Early career==
Michael was born in Western Australia and grew up in Canberra. After a brief stint working on Neal Bates&#x27; Toyota Celica GT-Four rally car, Michael studied mechanical engineering at the University of New South Wales with a thesis on data acquisition systems for racing cars. During his studies, Greg Siddle employed Michael on a part-time basis working on Mark Larkham&#x27;s Formula Holden, so that Michael could continue his studies.

==Formula 1==
Michael was recruited by UK-based Lotus in 1993. After Team Lotus went bankrupt in 1994 Gary Anderson, the chief designer at Jordan Grand Prix, took Michael on to establish the team&#x27;s research and development department. Michael spent two years working in the Jordan factory on data acquisition, and installed a seven-post rig for simulating suspension movement and designing an active differential.

In 1997, Michael joined the Jordan test team. In 1998 he was promoted to race engineer for Ralf Schumacher. When the German departed to go to Williams in 1999, Michael inherited Heinz-Harald Frentzen. His partnership with Frentzen was successful, resulting in a win at the French Grand Prix at Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, and then again at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

In 2001, Sir Frank Williams brought Michael to Williams as Senior Operations Engineer. He took over the responsibility of managing the engineers at races and tests. In May 2004, Michael was promoted to Technical Director of Williams, leaving Patrick Head to focus on engineering strategy.

In late 2011, Michael joined McLaren as Sporting Director, becoming part of the senior technical management team.

At McLaren, Michael came under pressure following a series of failures during pitstops, during the introduction of new equipment and procedures. Martin Whitmarsh defended Michael&#x27;s position, and shortly afterwards the changes began to pay off.

==Return to Australia==
At the end of 2014 Michael returned to Australia, after resigning from McLaren earlier that year. In mid-2016, Michael joined the Australian Institute for Motor Sport Safety board focusing on safety in motor sport. In late 2016, Michael took on a part-time mentoring role with Triple Eight Race Engineering after Ludo Lacroix moved to DJR Team Penske.

<text>Nelson Ackerman Eddy (June 29, 1901 – March 6, 1967) was an American actor and baritone singer who appeared in 19 musical films during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in opera and on the concert stage, radio, television, and in nightclubs. A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first &quot;crossover&quot; stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers and opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world.

During his 40-year career, he earned three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (one each for film, recording, and radio), left his footprints in the wet concrete at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, earned three gold records, and was invited to sing at the third inauguration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941. He also introduced millions of young Americans to classical music and inspired many of them to pursue a musical career.

==Early life==
Eddy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the only child of Caroline Isabel (née Kendrick) and William Darius Eddy. Nelson grew up in Providence and Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and in New Bedford, Massachusetts. As a boy, he was a strawberry blond and quickly acquired the nickname &quot;Bricktop&quot;. As an adult, his reddish hair prematurely whitened, so his hair photographed as blond. He came from a musical family. His Atlanta-born mother was a church soloist, and his grandmother, Caroline Netta Ackerman Kendrick, was a distinguished oratorio singer. His father occasionally moonlighted as a stagehand at the Providence Opera House, sang in the church choir, played the drums, and performed in local productions such as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;

Living in near poverty, Eddy was forced to drop out of school and moved with his mother to Philadelphia, where her brother, Clark Kendrick, lived. His uncle helped Eddy secure a clerical job at the Mott Iron Works, a plumbing supply company. He later worked as a reporter with &quot;The&quot; &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;, the &quot;Evening Public Ledger&quot;, and the &quot;Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot;. He also worked briefly as a copywriter at N.W. Ayer Advertising, but was dismissed for constantly singing on the job. Eddy never returned to school, but educated himself with correspondence courses.

==Career==
===Singing===
Eddy developed his talent as a boy soprano in church choirs. Throughout his teens, Eddy studied voice and imitated the recordings of baritones such as Titta Ruffo, Antonio Scotti, Pasquale Amato, Giuseppe Campanari, and Reinald Werrenrath. He gave recitals for women&#x27;s groups and appeared in society theatricals, usually for little or no pay.

He had a job in an iron works factory and then spent ten years as a newspaper reporter. He was fired for paying more attention to music than to journalism. His first professional break came in 1922, when the press singled him out after an appearance in a society theatrical, &quot;The Marriage Tax&quot;, although his name had been omitted from the program.

In 1924, Eddy won the top prize in a competition that included a chance to appear with the Philadelphia Opera Society. By the late 1920s, Eddy was appearing with the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company and had a repertoire of roles in 28 operas, including Amonasro in &quot;Aida&quot;, Marcello in &quot;La bohème&quot;, Papageno in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, both Tonio and Silvio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and Wolfram in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

Eddy performed in Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the Savoy Company, the oldest amateur theater company in the world devoted exclusively to the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. With Savoy, Eddy sang the leading role of Strephon in &quot;Iolanthe&quot; at the Broad Street Theatre in Philadelphia in 1922. The next year, he played the role of Major-General Stanley in Savoy&#x27;s production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. He reprised the role of Strephon with Savoy in 1927, when the group moved their performances to the Academy of Music. Thirty-one years later, he was asked for advice by a new Strephon with the company. Eddy wrote:

Eddy studied briefly with the noted teacher David Bispham, a former Metropolitan Opera singer, but when Bispham died suddenly, Eddy became a student of William Vilonat. In 1927, Eddy borrowed some money and followed his teacher to Dresden for further study in Europe, which was then considered essential for serious American singers. He was offered a job with a small German opera company. Instead, he decided to return to America, where he concentrated on his concert career, making only occasional opera appearances during the next seven years. In 1928, his first concert accompanist was a young pianist named Theodore (Ted) Paxson, who became a close friend and remained his accompanist until Eddy&#x27;s death 39 years later. In the early 1930s, Eddy&#x27;s principal teacher was Edouard Lippé, who followed him to Hollywood and appeared in a small role in Eddy&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;. In his later years, Eddy changed teachers frequently, constantly learning new vocal techniques. He also had a home recording studio, where he studied his own performances. It was his fascination with technology that inspired him to record three-part harmonies (tenor, baritone, &amp; bass) for his role as a multiple-voiced singing whale in the animated Walt Disney feature, &quot;The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met&quot;, the concluding sequence in the 1946 feature film &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;.

With the Philadelphia Civic Opera, Eddy sang in the first American performance of &quot;Feuersnot&quot; by Richard Strauss (December 1, 1927) and in the first American performance of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (November 1, 1928) with Helen Jepson. In &quot;Ariadne&quot;, Eddy sang the roles of the Wigmaker and Harlequin in the original German. He performed under Leopold Stokowski as the Drum Major in the second American performance of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; on November 24, 1931.

At Carnegie Hall in New York City, Christmas 1931, he sang in the world premiere of &quot;Maria egiziaca&quot; (&quot;Mary in Egypt&quot;), unexpectedly conducted by the composer Ottorino Respighi himself when famed conductor Arturo Toscanini fell ill at the last minute. Years later, when Toscanini visited the MGM lot in California, Eddy greeted him by singing a few bars of &quot;Maria egiziaca&quot;.

Eddy continued in occasional opera roles until his film work made it difficult to schedule appearances the requisite year or two in advance. Among his final opera performances were three with the San Francisco Opera in 1934, when he was still &quot;unknown&quot;. He also sang Amonasro in &quot;Aida&quot; on November 11, 1934, to similar acclaim. Elisabeth Rethberg, Giovanni Martinelli, and Ezio Pinza were in the cast. However, opera quietly faded from Eddy&#x27;s schedule as films and highly lucrative concerts claimed more and more of his time.

When he resumed his concert career following his screen success, he made a point of delivering a traditional concert repertoire, performing his hit screen songs only as encores. He felt strongly that audiences needed to be exposed to all kinds of music.

===Hollywood===

Eddy was &quot;discovered&quot; by Hollywood when he substituted at the last minute for the noted diva Lotte Lehmann at a sold-out concert in Los Angeles on February 28, 1933. He scored a professional triumph with 18 curtain calls, and several film offers immediately followed. After much agonizing, he decided that being seen on screen might boost audiences for what he considered his &quot;real work&quot;, his concerts. (Also, like his machinist father, he was fascinated with gadgets and the mechanics of the new talking pictures.) Eddy&#x27;s concert fee rose from $500 to $10,000 per performance.
Eddy signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he made the first 15 of his 19 feature films. His contract guaranteed him three months off each year to continue his concert tours. MGM was not sure how to use him, and he spent more than a year on salary with little to do. His voice can be heard singing &quot;Daisy Bell&quot; on the soundtrack of the 1933 Pete Smith short &quot;Handlebars&quot;. He appeared and sang one song each in &quot;Broadway to Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Dancing Lady&quot;, both in 1933, and &quot;Student Tour&quot; in 1934. Audience response was favorable, and he was cast as the male lead opposite the established star Jeanette MacDonald in the 1935 film version of Victor Herbert&#x27;s 1910 operetta &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;.

&quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; was the surprise hit of 1935. Its key song, &quot;Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life&quot;, became a hit and earned Eddy his first gold record. He also sang &quot;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Falling in Love with Someone&quot;. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, received the &quot;Photoplay&quot; Gold Medal Award as Best Picture, and was voted one of the Ten Best Pictures of 1935 by the New York film critics. Critics singled out Eddy for praise:

* &quot;A new movie star emerged from the Capitol screen...&quot; — &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.
* &quot;The screen has found a thrilling thrush, possessed not only of a rare vocal tone, but of a personality and form and features cast in the heroic mold.&quot; – &quot;New York American&quot;.
* &quot;Eddy ... has a brilliant baritone voice. He is engaging and good looking...&quot; – Richard Watts, Jr., in the &quot;New York Herald.&quot;

Eddy appeared in seven more MGM films with Jeanette MacDonald:
* &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1936) is probably his most-remembered film. Eddy sang &quot;Song of the Mounties&quot; and &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; by Rudolf Friml. His definitive portrayal of the steadfast Mountie became a popular icon, frequently spoofed in cartoons and TV skits, and even generating travesties on stage (&quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;, 1959). One long-lived imitation, Dudley Do-Right &quot;,&quot; began as a cartoon character on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; (1959-1964) and went on to be portrayed by Brendan Fraser in a live-action film, &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; (1999). When the Mounties retired their classic red jackets and campaign hats in 1970, except for ceremonial attire, hundreds of newspapers accompanied the story with a photo of Nelson Eddy as Sgt. Bruce in &quot;Rose Marie&quot;, made 34 years earlier.
* &quot;Maytime&quot; (1937) is regarded as one of Eddy&#x27;s best films. &quot;Will You Remember&quot; by Sigmund Romberg brought Eddy another gold record. Frank Nugent wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the film [was] &quot;the most entrancing operetta the screen has given us. ... and it affirms Nelson Eddy&#x27;s preeminence among the baritones of filmdom&quot;.
* &quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot; (1938) had an original score by Sigmund Romberg and reused the David Belasco stage plot also employed by Giacomo Puccini for &quot;La Fanciulla del West&quot;.

* &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938) was MGM&#x27;s first three-strip Technicolor feature, incorporating Victor Herbert&#x27;s 1913 stage score into a modern script by Dorothy Parker. It won the Photoplay Gold Medal Award as Best Picture of the Year.
* &quot;New Moon&quot; (1940) based on Romberg&#x27;s 1927 Broadway hit, became one of Eddy&#x27;s most popular films, although in 1978 it was included in the book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. His key songs were &quot;Lover, Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;Softly as in a Morning Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Wanting You&quot;, and &quot;Stout Hearted Men&quot;.
* &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1940) was a Technicolor film version of Noël Coward&#x27;s 1929 operetta. The love theme was &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot;. Eddy played a Viennese singing teacher who elopes with his pretty English pupil and takes her to live in Vienna.
* &quot;I Married an Angel&quot; (1942), adapted from the Rodgers and Hart stage musical about an angel who loses her wings on her wedding night, suffered from censorship problems. Eddy sang &quot;Spring Is Here&quot; and the title song.

Nelson Eddy also starred in films with other leading ladies:
* &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1937), with Eleanor Powell, offered a score by Cole Porter. In his first solo-starring film, the script called for Eddy to portray a football-playing West Point pilot who pursues a princess-in-disguise to Europe. Eddy recorded the title song.
* &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; (1939), with Virginia Bruce, was a Western. Eddy got to beat up rugged Oscar winner Victor McLaglen and preserve freedom and the American way from bad guys, a popular theme just before World War II.
* &quot;Balalaika&quot; (1939), with Ilona Massey, was based on the 1936 English operetta by George Posford and Bernard Grün. Eddy is a prince in disguise, in love with a commoner during the Russian Revolution. The title song became one of his standards.
* &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; (1941), with Metropolitan Opera star Risë Stevens, was a stylish musical adaptation of Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman&quot;. Eddy played a dual role and turned in one of his best performances.
* &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943) was Eddy&#x27;s first film after he left MGM at the end of his seven-year contract. This lavish Technicolor musical also starred Claude Rains as the Phantom and Susanna Foster as Christine.
* &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot; (1944) was based on the popular stage musical by Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson. It co-starred Charles Coburn (singing the classic &quot;September Song&quot;) and Constance Dowling.
* &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946) was a Walt Disney animated feature compilation. Eddy provided all the singing and speaking voices for the touching final segment, &quot;The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met,&quot; later released as a short, &quot;Willie, the Operatic Whale&quot;, by Disney in 1954. Using a technique based on his technical experiments with his home recording equipment, Eddy was able to sing sextets with himself on the soundtrack, providing all the voices from bass to soprano.
* &quot;Northwest Outpost&quot; (1947) co-starred Ilona Massey. Rudolf Friml provided the songs for a story of Fort Ross, a Russian settlement in the Wild West of California. It was made at Republic Studios and turned out to be Eddy&#x27;s final film.

After Eddy and MacDonald left MGM in 1942, several unrealized films remained that would have reunited the team. Eddy signed with Universal in 1943 for a two-picture deal. The first was &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and the second would have co-starred MacDonald. She filmed her two scenes for &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;, then both stars severed ties with Universal. Eddy was upset with how &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; turned out.

Among their later other proposed projects were &quot;East Wind&quot;; &quot;Crescent Carnival&quot;, a book optioned by MacDonald; and &quot;The Rosary&quot;, the 1910 best-seller, which Eddy had read as a teen and pitched to MGM as a &quot;comeback&quot; film for MacDonald and himself in 1948. Under the name &quot;Isaac Ackerman&quot; he wrote a biopic screenplay about Chaliapin, in which he was to play the lead and also a young Nelson Eddy, but it was never produced. He also wrote two movie treatments for MacDonald and himself, &quot;Timothy Waits for Love&quot; and &quot;All Stars Don&#x27;t Spangle&quot;.

Eddy made more than 290 recordings between 1935 and 1964, singing songs from his films, plus opera, folk songs, popular songs, Gilbert and Sullivan, and traditional arias from his concert repertoire. Since both MacDonald and he were under contract to RCA Victor between 1935 and 1938, this made it possible to include several popular duets from their films. In 1938, he signed with the Columbia Masterworks division of Columbia Records, which ended MacDonald-Eddy duets until &quot;Favorites in Stereo&quot;, a special LP album the two made together in 1959. He also recorded duets with his other screen partner, Risë Stevens (&quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot;), and for albums with, among others, Nadine Conner, Doretta Morrow, Eleanor Steber, and Jo Stafford.

Eddy&#x27;s recordings drew rave reviews during the 1930s and 1940s, and he continued to get good reviews into the 1960s. The &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; on October 4, 1964, noted: &quot;Nelson Eddy continues to roll along, physically and vocally indestructible. Proof is his newest recording on the Everest label, &quot;Of Girls I Sing&quot;. At the age of 63 and after 42 years of professional singing, Eddy demonstrates not much change has occurred in his romantic and robust baritone, which made him America&#x27;s most popular singer in the early &#x27;30s&quot;.

===War work===
Like many performers, Eddy was active during World War II, even before the United States entered the war. He did his first &quot;war effort&quot; concert on October 19, 1939, with Leopold Stokowski for Polish war relief. In 1942, he became an air raid warden and also put in long hours at the Hollywood Canteen. He broadcast for the armed forces throughout the war. In late 1943, he went on a two-month, 35,000-mile tour, giving concerts for military personnel in Belém and Natal, Brazil; Accra, Gold Coast; Aden; Asmara, Eritrea; Cairo (where he met King Farouk); Tehran; Casablanca; and the Azores. Because he spoke fluent German, having studied opera in Dresden during the 1920s, his work as an Allied spy was invaluable until his cover was blown with a near-fatal assignment in Cairo.

===Radio and television===

Eddy had his own show on CBS (1942–1943) and starred on &quot;The Electric Hour&quot; (1944-1946).

His version of the song &quot;Rose Marie&quot; was used as the subject of an episode of the Scottish comedy sitcom &quot;Still Game&quot; (S4E2), in which the song was requested by a dying patient.
He began his more than 600 radio appearances in the mid-1920s. The first may have been on December 26, 1924, at station WOO in Philadelphia. Besides his many guest appearances, he hosted &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; (1936), &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; (1937–1939), and &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; (1947–1948), among other programs. Eddy frequently used his radio shows to advance the careers of promising young singers. While his programs often featured &quot;serious&quot; music, they were never straitlaced. It was in a series of comedy routines with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the &quot;Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; that Eddy&#x27;s name became associated with the song &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot;, which was also included in the film &quot;Maytime&quot;. On March 31, 1933, he performed the role of Gurnemanz in a broadcast of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Parsifal&quot; with Rose Bampton, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. During the 1940s, he was a frequent guest on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; with Cecil B. DeMille, performing radio versions of Eddy&#x27;s popular films. In 1951, Eddy guest-starred on several episodes of &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; on CBS-TV. In 1952, he recorded a pilot for a sitcom, &quot;Nelson Eddy&#x27;s Backyard&quot;, with Jan Clayton, but it failed to find a network slot. On November 12, 1952, he surprised his former co-star Jeanette MacDonald when she was the subject of Ralph Edwards&#x27; &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. On November 30, 1952, Eddy was Ed Sullivan&#x27;s guest on &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;.

During the next decade, he guest-starred on Danny Thomas&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; and on variety programs such as &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, &quot;The Bob Hope Show&quot;, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;. His television reunions with Jeanette MacDonald included &quot;Lux Video Theater&quot; and &quot;The Big Record&quot; (with Patti Page). Both appearances were highly successful but MacDonald&#x27;s health was failing and although there was talk of their hosting a TV variety show together, it did not happen.

Eddy was a frequent guest on talk shows, including &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jack Paar. On May 7, 1955, Eddy starred in Max Liebman&#x27;s 90-minute, live-TV version of Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s &quot;The Desert Song&quot; on NBC-TV. It featured Gale Sherwood, Metropolitan Opera bass Salvatore Baccaloni, veteran film actor Otto Kruger, Broadway tenor Earl William and the dance team of Bambi Linn and Rod Alexander.

===Nightclub act===
The advent of television made inroads in the once-lucrative concert circuits, and in the early 1950s, Eddy considered future career options, eventually deciding to form a nightclub act. It premiered in January 1953, with singer Gale Sherwood, his partner, and Ted Paxson, his accompanist. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Nelson Eddy, vet of films, concerts, and stage, required less than one minute to put a jam-packed audience in his hip pocket in one of the most explosive openings in this city&#x27;s nightery history... Before Eddy had even started to sing, they liked him personally as a warm human being&quot;. The act continued for the next 15 years and made four tours of Australia.

==Personal life==
Eddy married Ann Denitz Franklin, former wife of noted director Sidney Franklin, on January 19, 1939. Her son, Sidney Jr., became Eddy&#x27;s stepson, but Nelson and she had no children of their own. They were married for 27 years, until Nelson&#x27;s death. Ann Eddy died on August 28, 1987. She is buried next to Eddy and Eddy&#x27;s mother in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Eddy was a Republican.

=== Relationship with Jeanette MacDonald ===
 
Despite public denials from the stars themselves of any personal relationship between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, documentation shows otherwise. In a handwritten 1935 letter by Nelson to &quot;Dearest Jeanette&quot;, written on his letterhead, Nelson Eddy wrote: &quot;I love you and will always be devoted to you.&quot;
In the biography &quot;Sweethearts&quot; by Sharon Rich, the author presents MacDonald and Eddy as continuing an adulterous affair after their marriages. Rich, who was a close friend of MacDonald&#x27;s older sister Blossom Rock, also knew Gene Raymond, and she documents that the relationship lasted with a few breaks until MacDonald&#x27;s death. Newsreel footage from MacDonald&#x27;s funeral shows Eddy as the last person exiting the chapel, circled by other celebrities, such as Lauritz Melchior, who offer him condolences.
MacDonald had a reported eight pregnancies by Eddy, the first one while they were filming &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. This was before she had an intimate relationship with Gene Raymond. Raymond was physically unable to father children, and MacDonald alluded to this fact in her unfinished autobiography, writing that she returned from her Hawaii honeymoon with Raymond with the knowledge that &quot;The MacRaymonds had no children.&quot; Nevertheless, MacDonald had additional documented and visible pregnancies while married to Raymond, all of which ended in miscarriage.

Biographer E. J. Fleming also alleges that Eddy confronted Raymond about physically abusing MacDonald, who was visibly pregnant with Eddy&#x27;s child while filming &quot;Sweethearts.&quot; Eddy attacked him and left him for dead; newspapers reported incorrectly that Raymond was recovering from an accidental fall.
Louis B. Mayer adamantly refused to allow MacDonald to annul her marriage and elope. The situation ended with MacDonald losing her baby at nearly 6 months. The boy was named Daniel Kendrick Eddy, and Nelson buried him (or his ashes) on private property in Ojai, California.

Over the decades, MacDonald and Eddy had several private homes together. In 1938, they had a small Burbank house located at 812 S Mariposa Street. In the 1940s, Nelson leased and remodeled, for himself and MacDonald, the old cowboy bunkhouse at 1330 Angelo Drive, Beverly Hills. Starting in 1947, they used 710 N. Camden Drive, which had been the home of MacDonald&#x27;s mother until her death. They also alternately stayed at favorite hotels and homes owned by their celebrity friends throughout the United States, including homes owned by Lily Pons and Irene Dunne. In 1963, MacDonald and Raymond moved into two adjoining apartments on the 8th floor in the East building at the Wilshire Comstock in Westwood. Nelson Eddy had his own apartment on the 7th floor of the West building. He allowed MacDonald to decorate it, and they used it as a rendezvous spot until she was too weak to walk the few yards over to his building. (After Eddy&#x27;s death, his widow Ann learned of the apartment and moved into it.)
Forbidden to marry early on by MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer, MacDonald and Eddy performed an unofficial wedding ceremony at Lake Tahoe while filming &quot;Rose Marie&quot;. They considered that &quot;by God&#x27;s laws&quot;, they had married, although they were never able to do so legally. Each fall, they returned to Tahoe to renew their vows. As late as 1948, MacDonald&#x27;s desk diary had a handwritten &quot;Lake Tahoe&quot; entry. After their 1943 visit, Eddy wrote a lengthy diary entry about their trip and his love for her, calling her &quot;my wife&quot;, which he did in private to the end of her life.

==Death==

On March 5, 1967, Eddy was performing at the Sans Souci Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida when he was stricken on stage with a cerebral hemorrhage. According to Gore Vidal, writing in &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;, he was singing &quot;Dardanella&quot; when he collapsed. His singing partner, Gale Sherwood, and his accompanist, Ted Paxson, were at his side. He died a few hours later in the early hours of March 6, 1967, at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, aged 65.

He is interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, between his mother and his widow (who outlived him by twenty years).

==Papers==
Eddy&#x27;s meticulously annotated scores (some with his caricatures sketched in the margins) are now housed at Occidental College Special Collections in Los Angeles. His personal papers and scrapbooks are at the University of Southern California Cinema/Television Library, also in Los Angeles.

<text>A toothpick is a small thin stick of wood, plastic, bamboo, metal, bone or other substance with at least one and sometimes two pointed ends to insert between teeth to remove detritus, usually after a meal. Toothpicks are also used for festive occasions to hold or spear small appetizers (like cheese cubes or olives) or as a cocktail stick, and can be decorated with plastic frills or small paper umbrellas or flags.

== History ==
Known in all cultures, the toothpick is the oldest instrument for dental cleaning. Hominin remains from Dmanisi, Georgia, dated to about 1.8 million years ago, bear lesions indicating the repeated use of a “toothpick”. A Neanderthal man&#x27;s jawbone found in the Cova Foradà in Spain evidenced use of a toothpick to alleviate pain in his teeth caused by periodontal disease and dental wear. Toothpicks made of bronze have been found as burial objects in prehistoric graves in Northern Italy and in the East Alps. In 1986, researchers in Florida discovered the 7500-year-old remains of ancient Native Americans and discovered small grooves between many of the molar teeth. One of the researchers, Justin Martin of Concordia University Wisconsin, said, &quot;The enamel on teeth is quite tough, so they must have used the probes quite rigorously to make the grooves.&quot;

== Materials and manufacture ==
There are delicate, artistic examples made of silver in antiquity, as well as from mastic wood with the Romans.
In the 17th century, toothpicks were luxury objects and like jewelry, were artfully stylized using precious metal and set with expensive stones.

In the Southern United States, the baculum (penis bone) of a raccoon, called a &quot;coon rod&quot;, was sometimes filed to a point for use as a toothpick.

The first toothpick-manufacturing machine was developed in 1869, by Marc Signorello. Another was patented in 1872, by Silas Noble and J. P. Cooley.

Wooden toothpicks are cut from birch wood. Logs are first spiral cut into thin sheets, which are then cut, chopped, milled and bleached (to lighten) into the individual toothpicks. Nowadays other means of interdental cleaning are preferred such as dental floss, toothbrushes, and oral irrigators.

== Dentistry ==
Dentists generally prefer floss to picks because of possible damages to oral health, specifically to the gum, to tooth enamel (if chewed), to tooth roots (if the gum is pushed low enough). Picks may also damage veneers and crowns, have splinters, or be accidentally swallowed.

A review of small-scale studies indicates that toothpicks and triangular woodsticks are similar in their ability to remove plaque.

<doc id="695715" wikidata="Q2564354" url="?curid=695715" title="Swedish Ingria">
<text>Swedish Ingria (, ‘land of Ingrians’) was a dominion of the Swedish Empire from 1583 to 1595 and then again from 1617 to 1721 in what is now the territory of Russia. At the latter date, it was ceded to the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Nystad, at the end of the Great Northern War between the two empires.

==History==
In 1617 Russia ceded Ingria and the County of Kexholm to Sweden under the Treaty of Stolbovo. This area was along the basin of the Neva River, between the Gulf of Finland, the Narva River, and Lake Peipus to the southwest, and Lake Ladoga to the northeast. Kexholm and Swedish Karelia were bordered by the Sestra &quot;(Rajajoki/Systerbäck)&quot; river to the northwest.

Ingria had fallen to Sweden in the 1580s, was returned to Russia by the Treaty of Teusina (1595), and again ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Stolbovo (1617). Sweden&#x27;s interest in the territory was strategic: as a buffer zone against Russian attacks on the Karelian Isthmus and present-day Finland; and Russian trade was to pass through Swedish territory. In addition, Ingria was used as a destination for Swedish deportees.

Ingria remained sparsely populated. In 1664 the population was counted as 15,000. Swedish attempts to introduce Lutheranism were met with repugnance by the Orthodox peasantry obliged to attend Lutheran services. Although converts were promised grants and tax reductions, Lutheran gains were chiefly due to voluntary resettlements from Savonia and Karelia. Ingria was enfeoffed to noble military and state officials, who brought their own Lutheran servants and workmen to the area. The indigenous inhabitants of Ingria have always been Finnic with Finnic culture and language.

Nyen became the trading centre of Ingria, and in 1642 was made its administrative centre. In 1656 a Russian attack badly damaged the town, and the administrative centre was moved to Narva in neighbouring Swedish Estonia.

In the early 18th century the area was reconquered by Russia in the Great Northern War after a century under Swedish possession. The new Russian capital, Saint Petersburg, was founded in 1703 on the site of the Swedish town Nyen (Finnish &quot;Nevanlinna&quot;, meaning &quot;Castle of Neva&quot;). This territory, close to the Neva river&#x27;s estuary at the Gulf of Finland, is now part of Leningrad Oblast, Russia.

<text>Norman Thomas &quot;Turkey&quot; Stearnes (May 8, 1901 – September 4, 1979) was an American baseball center fielder. He played 18 years in the Negro leagues, including nine years with the Detroit Stars (1923–1931), six years with the Chicago American Giants (1932–1935, 1937–1938), and three years with the Kansas City Monarchs (1938–1940).

Stearnes ranks fifth in Major League Baseball (MLB) history with a .616 career slugging percentage and seventh in MLB history with a .348 career batting average. He led the Negro National League (NNL) in home runs six times. He won the NNL batting championship in 1929 with a .390 batting average and repeated as batting champion in 1931 with a .376 average.

Stearnes was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000.

== Early years ==
Stearnes was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1901. There are two versions as to how he acquired the nickname &quot;Turkey&quot;. The most common version is that the name came from his unusual style of running the bases while flapping his arms. The second version, advanced by Stearnes himself, was that he gained the nickname due to a pot belly he had as a child.

Stearnes attended Pearl High School in Nashville. He later recalled: &quot;I learned to play baseball in high school. We had a lot of sandlots. All the schools around there had clubs. At that time I was a pitcher. They were getting me to play every Friday.&quot; Stearnes&#x27; father died when he was 15 years old. Stearnes left school to find work to support his family. Stearnes later recalled: &quot;I just did any job that popped up, taking care of hogs or cows and anything like that. I worked at a grocery store, driving a wagon, delivering groceries. I worked at the Baptist Publishing Board, a janitor mostly, running errands.&quot; He continued to play sandlot baseball on Saturdays and Sundays.

== Professional baseball player ==
===Negro Southern League (1921-22)===
Stearnes began his career in professional baseball in 1921 with the Montgomery Grey Sox of the Southern Negro League. He was Montgomery&#x27;s leadoff hitter and led the club to the league pennant. He switched to the Memphis Red Sox. In his history of the Negro leagues, Mark Ribowsky described the impact Stearnes had in Montgomery:In Montgomery, Alabama, a cobralike outfielder, Norman &quot;Turkey&quot; Stearnes, was ripping up league pitching. All arms and legs, Stearnes was a pastiche of oddities; in his batting stance he leaned way forward and his back foot pointed straight up. When he ran, his elbows flapped in and out — thus his nickname. He choked up on a light, thin bat, yet he hit moonshot home runs.

In 1922, Stearnes joined the Memphis Red Sox of the Southern Negro League and continued to play well. The Detroit Stars sent catcher Bruce Petway to Memphis to scout Stearnes, who was then playing first base and pitcher. Petway offered Stearnes a chance to play with the Stars in 1922. Stearnes declined, deciding to remain in Tennessee to finish high school.

===Detroit Stars (1923-31)===
After finishing high school, Stearnes traveled to Detroit and joined the Stars in March 1923. In an interview with Negro league historian John B. Holway, Stearnes described his move to Detroit:I came north in 1923, March 1. I came here to Detroit. I worked at the Briggs Manufacturing Company, the same man that owned the Tigers. All our gang. He gave us a job out there and we&#x27;d play semi-pro. We were painting the bodies of the cars. I was putting them into the drier myself. The white boys were painting. I’d put them on the drier for them. . . . In ’23 I was playing professional ball with the Detroit Stars out on Mack Avenue. . . .That was the biggest thing doing around here in the Detroit among the colored.&quot;

As a rookie in 1923, Stearnes immediately became one of the top players of the Negro National League (NNL). He led the NNL with 14 triples and ranked among the NNL leaders with 49 extra base hits (second), 136 putouts in center field (second), 17 home runs (third), 85 RBIs (third), 70 runs scored (third), 198 total bases (third), a .710 slugging percentage (third), and a .362 batting average (seventh).
Stearnes&#x27; remained a fixture with the Stars, holding down the center field position for nine years from 1923 to 1931. He had one of his finest seasons in 1925 when he hit for a .371 batting average and a .668 slugging percentage and led the NNL in hits (135), triples (14), home runs (19), and RBIs (126). Three years later in 1929, he recorded his first NNL batting championship with an average of .390 and also led the league with a .468 on-base percentage and a .672 slugging percentage.

In 1930, Stearnes left Detroit to play for the New York Lincoln Giants. He returned to Detroit after playing 20 games in New York. Playing without Stearnes, the Stars finished fourth in the first half of the season; with Stearnes&#x27; return, they won the second-half pennant.

In 1931, his final year with the Stars, Stearnes won his second NNL batting championship with a .376 average and again led the league in on-base percentage (.465) and slugging (.632).

===Chicago/Cole&#x27;s American Giants (1932-35)===
The Detroit Stars folded after the 1931 season, and Stearnes joined the 1932 Cole&#x27;s American Giants of Chicago and helped lead the team to the Negro National League pennant. At the end of the 1932 season, the American Giants faced the Nashville Elite Giants in a postseason series. Stearnes played in two games and drove in five runs with seven hits.

Stearnes continued as the American Giants&#x27; center fielder through the 1935 season. He remained one of the best players in the Negro leagues. In 1934, he led the league&#x27;s center fielders with a .989 fielding percentage. In 1935, he compiled a career-high .469 on-base percentage and ranked among the league&#x27;s leaders with a .388 batting average (second), 52 RBIs (second), a .624 slugging percentage (second), 86 putouts in center field (second), and 106 total bases (third).

===Philadelphia and Detroit (1936-37)===
In 1936, Stearnes played for the Philadelphia Stars. He led the Negro National League with five triples and 120 putouts by a center fielder and ranked among the leagues leaders with 122 total bases (second), 74 hits (second), 23 extra base hits (second), 43 RBIs (second), 45 runs scored (third), 10 home runs (third) and a .571 slugging percentage (fourth).

Stearnes returned to Detroit Stars in 1937. His batting average dipped to .286 but he still ranked second in the league with five home runs.

===Chicago and Kansas City (1937-40)===
Stearnes concluded his major-league career with the Chicago American Giants (1937–38) and Kansas City Monarchs (1938–40). In 1939, he compiled a .330 batting average and led the Negro American League (NAL) in both runs (47) and home runs (7). In 1940, his final major-league season, Stearnes at age 39 led the NAL in both RBIs (33) and home runs (5).

===An all-around player: Power, average, speed, and fielding===
Despite his slender build, Stearnes led the Negro major leagues in home runs seven times—1924, 1925, 1928, 1931, 1932, 1939, and 1940. He hit a career-high 24 home runs in only NNL 80 games played in 1928. His 187 career home runs is the most in Negro leagues history, seven more than second-place Mule Suttles.

In an interview with John Holway, Stearnes described the source of his power as follows: &quot;I never did weigh over 168 pounds. Well, I have reached up to 175 my last few years in baseball. But people couldn&#x27;t understand how I hit the ball so hard and far. . . . I was strong in my shoulders; that was the difference.&quot;

Despite being one of the Negro leagues&#x27; best home run hitters, he was typically a leadoff hitter. In his history of the Negro leagues, Leslie A. Heaphy wrote: &quot;Stearnes generally led off even though he had a fair amount of power. His speed and his high average made him a great choice at the top of the order. . . . He also had great speed and a strong arm.&quot;

Stearnes was also known for his unusual batting stance. The Negro League Baseball Museum described it as follows: &quot;Stearnes had an unique stance, with his front foot turned heel down and toe pointed straight up, but although not a heavy man, he was a natural hitter with powerful shoulders.&quot; Biographer Richard Bak described the stance as &quot;right foot splayed, the toe pointed skyward.&quot; Satchel Paige noted: &quot;He had a funny stance, but he could get around on you. . . . He was one of the greatest hitters we ever had. He was as good as Josh [Gibson]. He was as good as anybody ever played baseball.&quot; Another contemporary, Jimmie Crutchfield, recalled Stearnes as a &quot;quicky-jerky sort of guy who could hit the ball a mile. Turkey had a batting stance that you&#x27;d swear couldn&#x27;t let anybody hit a baseball at all. He&#x27;d stand up there looking like he was off balance. But, it was natural for him to stand that way, and you couldn&#x27;t criticize him for it when he was hitting everything they threw at him!&quot;

Despite having played pitcher and first base before joining the Stars, Sternes also won a reputation as one of the best center fielders in the history of the Negro leagues. Negro league contemporary Ted Radcliffe opined that even &quot;Cool Papa Bell couldn&#x27;t field with Turkey Stearnes. [Bell] was faster, but Turkey Stearnes was one of the best fly ball men.&quot;

Stearnes&#x27; career totals rank him among the greatest batters in baseball history:
* His .6157 career slugging percentage ranks fifth in major-league history. 
* His .348 career batting average ranks seventh highest in major-league history. 
* His .4168 on-base percentage ranks 24th highest in baseball history.

He led Negro league baseball in triples six times (1923–1925, 1927, 1934, 1936), which is the most all-time. In light of Major League Baseball announcing several of the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 as major leagues, Stearnes now shares the record for most times leading a league in triples with Sam Crawford. He is one of nine players in Negro league baseball history to have won multiple batting titles, with only Josh Gibson and Oscar Charleston having more than Stearnes, who won twice.

Cool Papa Bell said of Stearnes: &quot;That man could hit the ball as far as anybody. And he was one of our best all-around players. He could field, he could hit, he could run. He had plenty of power.&quot;

== Family and later years ==
Despite his accomplishments, Stearnes had to work winters in Detroit&#x27;s auto plants to survive. He worked for 30 years for the Ford Motor Company in the foundry at the River Rouge plant.

In 1946, Stearnes was married to his wife, Nettie, a school teacher. Nettie was also a niece of Negro league veteran Ted Radcliffe. Stearnes and his wife lived in a modest house on Detroit&#x27;s east side. They had two daughters, Joyce and Rosilyn.

In 1979, Stearnes had a heart attack. Later that year, he suffered complications after surgery at Detroit&#x27;s Harper Hospital for a large stomach ulcer, falling into a coma. He died on September 4, 1979, at the age of 78.

In 2023, Vanessa Ivy Rose, Stearnes&#x27; granddaughter released a 6-part podcast named “Reclaimed: The Forgotten League” which told the story of many of the greats of the Negro Leagues. It was promoted and distributed by ABC and ESPN&#x27;s 30-for-30.

==Baseball Hall of Fame and legacy==
Stearnes was not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during his lifetime. Even as the Hall began to induct others who had played only in the Negro leagues (Cool Papa Bell in 1974, Oscar Charleston in 1976, and Pop Lloyd in 1977), Stearnes was overlooked. Stearnes&#x27; widow Nettie noted: &quot;Norman was very shy. He&#x27;d play very well, then go right home after the game.&quot; Stearnes&#x27; biographer Richard Bak added: &quot;Lacking a colorful personality, he never was a fixture in the storytelling that earned other Negro leaguers belated entry to Cooperstown in the 1970s and 1980s.&quot; A stand-offish personality likely also detracted from his popularity. Bob Sampson, who was track coach at Cass Tech High School, recalled: &quot;You could go up to him and say something to him, but he wouldn&#x27;t talk. Never seen anybody like him. . . . He was a peculiar fellow, but he sure could play the game.&quot;

After Stearnes&#x27; death in 1979, Nettie led a 20-year campaign to have Stearnes inducted into the Hall of Fame. Stearnes was finally inducted in July 2000. At the induction ceremony, Nettie said: &quot;I prayed every morning for 20 years that this would happen. My husband was one of the greatest baseball players ever to play the game. . . . This is certainly an honor he deserved. We wish it could have happened during his lifetime.&quot;

Stearnes also received other notable posthumous honors, including the following:

* In 2001, baseball historian Bill James ranked Stearnes as the 25th greatest baseball player of all time.
* In July 2007, the Detroit Tigers held a Turkey Stearnes day at Comerica Park. As part of the ceremonies, a permanent plaque honoring Stearnes was unveiled outside the center field gate.
* Stearnes was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in February 2008.
* Stearnes was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in February 2010.
* In 2019, a display honoring Stearnes was included in the Hank Greenberg Walk of Heroes at The Corner Ballpark (the historic site of Tiger Stadium) at the intersection of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues in Detroit.

<text>Willem Kieft, also &quot;Wilhelm Kieft&quot;, (September 1597 – September 27, 1647) was a Dutch merchant and the Director of New Netherland (of which New Amsterdam was the capital) from 1638 to 1647.

==Life and career==
Willem Kieft was appointed to the rank of director by the Dutch West India Company in 1638. He formed the council of twelve men, the first representative body in New Netherland, but ignored its advice.

He tried to tax, and then drive out, local Native Americans. He ordered attacks on Pavonia and Corlears Hook on February 25, 1643, which erupted into a horrific massacre (129 Dutch soldiers killed 120 Indians, including women and children). The Dutch local citizen advisory group had been specifically against such a raid, and were aghast when they heard the details. This was followed by retaliations resulting in what would become known as Kieft&#x27;s War (1643–1645). The war took a huge toll on both sides, and the directors of the Dutch West India Company dismissed him in 1647. Peter Stuyvesant succeeded Kieft in office.

Kieft died on September 27, 1647, in the &quot;Princess Amelia&quot; shipwreck near Swansea, Wales, en route to Amsterdam to defend himself, along with many of his opponents, including the Rev. Everardus Bogardus. His archive was also lost, so his exact role cannot be established apart from what his opponents wrote of him. He is depicted in the Gods of Manhattan series by Scott Mebus.

<doc id="695734" wikidata="Q917027" url="?curid=695734" title="Pengo (video game)">
<text>is an arcade video game developed by Coreland and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan on September 26, 1982, in North America the following month, and in Europe that December. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that resides in the Antarctic. The game takes place in an overhead maze made of ice blocks, where Pengo crushes blob-like Sno-Bees by sliding blocks into them. The objective is to survive each round by eliminating all Sno-Bees and Sno-Bee eggs, while optionally lining up the three diamond blocks to earn a large score bonus.

There are two versions of the arcade game: the first uses &quot;Popcorn&quot; as the theme, and the second has original music. There are other small differences as well. &quot;Pengo&quot; was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, and Game Gear.

==Gameplay==

The player uses a four-position joystick and a single button to control Pengo, a penguin character. Pressing the button while pushing the joystick against an ice block will cause it to slide in that direction until it hits another block or a wall if the space ahead of it is empty. If that space is occupied, pressing the button will crush the block instead.

The goal is to destroy every Sno-Bee on the board by sliding ice blocks to crush them, crushing blocks that contain unhatched Sno-Bee eggs, or running over them after stunning them at a wall. Doing so in less than 60 seconds awards bonus points based on the time taken. 

At the start of each round, a certain number of eggs hatch into Sno-Bees, while other blocks flash to indicate that they contain eggs. As the player destroys active Sno-Bees, new ones hatch from the eggs to replace them. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees with one block awards extra points. The Sno-Bees can crush blocks in an attempt to reach Pengo. Pushing against a wall causes it to vibrate and temporarily stuns any Sno-Bees in contact with it; the player may then crush them with a block or simply run over them to destroy them. 

Three blocks in each round are marked with diamonds and cannot be crushed. Bonus points are awarded for forming a continuous vertical or horizontal line of these blocks: 10,000 if none of them are touching a wall, or 5,000 otherwise. Forming such a line also stuns every active Sno-Bee for a short time. 

If the player survives for two minutes without either losing a life or completing the round, all active Sno-Bees become Blobs. Their movement speed increases and they will move directly toward one of the walls, crushing all ice blocks in their path. Once a Blob reaches a wall, it will move toward a corner of the screen and disappear upon reaching it. Once all Blobs have either disappeared or been destroyed, the round ends. If the player destroys one of the last two Sno-Bees, the survivor will become a Blob after a 12-second delay. However, if the player destroys multiple Sno-Bees and leaves only one alive, it will become a Blob immediately.

The game includes a total of 16 rounds. After every second round, one of six intermission animations is displayed. It then repeats indefinitely.

One life is lost whenever Pengo touches an un-stunned Sno-Bee or Blob. When all lives are lost, the game ends.

== Reception ==
In Japan, the annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart listed &quot;Pengo&quot; as the fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1982. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed &quot;Pengo&quot; in their June 1, 1983 issue as the fifteenth top-grossing table arcade cabinet of the month. In North America, the game was a commercial arcade success for Sega in 1982, and it sold an estimated 2,000 arcade cabinets in the United States.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (&quot;C&amp;VG&quot;) magazine gave it a highly positive review upon release, calling it &quot;the cutest of coin-operated video games&quot; and praising the &quot;wonderful graphics, delightful characterisation, plenty of scope to work out your own&quot; tactics, &quot;catchy melody&quot; and &quot;that feeling of satisfaction you get when an ice-block picks up speed and knocks all the wind out of a surprised sno-bee!&quot; Four members of the &quot;C&amp;VG&quot; team gave a verdict that &quot;is unanimous... &quot;Pengo&quot; is the C&amp;VG tip for 1983&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1982 and 1983 Bandai Electronics created two official Sega licensed handheld games featuring Pengo. The first was an LCD pocket game, the second a VFD tabletop version. In 1995 a brand new game called &quot;Pepenga Pengo&quot; was released for the Sega Mega Drive only in Japan.

According to &quot;Zero&quot; magazine, Hudson Soft&#x27;s &quot;Bomberman&quot; series adopted gameplay elements from &quot;Pengo&quot;.

In 2010 a location test for the wide screen remake was announced in arcades, which features eight player multiplay. A second location test took place at Sega Shinjuku Nishiguchi in May 2012. During the 3rd location test at Club Sega Akihabara Shinkan between 2012-07-14 and 2012-07-16 as part of the 4-game compilation title named &#x27;Ge-sen Love ~Plus Pengo!~&#x27; (ゲーセンラブ。～プラス ペンゴ！～), the game was made available as a download by RINGEDGE2 machines through Sega&#x27;s new ALL.NET P-ras Multi game network, and was later released on 2012-09-20. The compilation title is included with the Xbox 360 game &quot;Ge-sen Love Plus Pengo!&quot;.

===Clones===
Contemporaraneous &quot;Pengo&quot; clones include Orca&#x27;s &quot;Penga&quot;, &quot;Pengi&quot; for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, &quot;Percy Penguin&quot; for the Commodore 64, &quot;Block Buster&quot; for the VIC-20, &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; for the Microbee, &quot;Pengon&quot; for the TRS-80 Color Computer, the unrelated &quot;Pengon&quot; for Atari 8-bit computers, &quot;Pengy&quot; for the Atari ST, &quot;Freez&#x27;Bees&quot; and &quot;Do-Do&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, &quot;Stone Age&quot; for the VTech CreatiVision, and &quot;Pango&quot; for MS-DOS. &quot;Hopper&quot; is a clone for the TI-99/4A with a kangaroo instead of a penguin. &quot;Bubble Trouble&quot; is an underwater-themed adaptation for Macintosh computers.

<text>Kolar district () is a district in the state of Karnataka, India.

Kolar (ಕೋಲಾರ) is the district headquarters. Located in southern Karnataka, it is the state&#x27;s easternmost district. The district is surrounded by the Bangalore Rural district on the west, Chikballapur district on the north, the Chittoor district and Annamayya district of Andhra Pradesh on the east and the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu on the south.

On 10 September 2007, it was bifurcated to form the new district of Chikballapur. Due to the discovery of the Kolar Gold Fields, the district has become known as the &quot;Golden Land&quot; of India.

People are citing that still gold is present in Kolar Gold Fields mines abundantly and also exists in Mulbagal, Kolar, Bangarapet, Malur, Srinivasapura taluks of Kolar District. However it must have to be confirmed by the state and as well central government authorities.

==History==

Kolar, formerly known as Kolahala, Kuvalala and Kolala, was called Kolahalapura during the Middle Ages. In Kannada, &quot;kolahalapura&quot; means &quot;violent city&quot; and it was the battlefield for the warring Chalukyas in the north and the Cholas in the south. In 1004 AD, the Cholas annexed Kolar until 1116. Vishnuvardhana (1108-1142) freed Gangavadi from the Cholas and, to commemorate his victory, built the Chennakesava Temple at Belur.

Kolaramma and Someshwara are notable temples in Kolar. The Kolaramma temple, built in Dravida Vimana style during the second century, is dedicated to Shakti. It underwent renovations under Rajendra Chola I in the 10th century and the Vijayanagara kings in the 15th century. Someswara Temple is an example of 14th-century Vijayanagara art.

Kolar&#x27;s early history was compiled by Fred Goodwill, superintendent of the Wesleyan Tamil mission in Bangalore and the Kolar Gold Fields, and his studies have been published in a number of journals. Older than Bangalore, Kolar dates back to the second century. The Western Gangas made Kolar their capital, ruling Mysore, Coimbatore, and Salem. During the 13th century Bhavanandi composed &quot;Nannool&quot;, his treatise on Tamil grammar.

Under the Cholas, King Sridhar kora (ruled 970–985) reportedly built the temple for Renuka and founded the city of Kolaahalapuram. Veera Chola, Vikrama Chola and Rajendra Chola I built stone structures with inscriptions at Avani, Mulbagal, Sitti Bettta and elsewhere. Chola inscriptions, which document the rule of Adithya Chola I (871-907), Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I of Kolar, refer to Kolar as Nikarili Cholamandalam and Jayam Konda Chola Manadalam. Inscriptions from Rajendra Chola I also appear on the Kolaramma Temple. Many Siva temples were built in Kolar during the reign of the Cholas, including the Someshwarar and Sri Uddhandeshwari Temples at Maarikuppam Village, the Eswaran Temple at Oorugaumpet and the Sivan Temple at Madivala Village. Chola rule of Kolar lasted until 1116. The inscriptions are neglected, and some have been vandalised.

In 1117 Kolar became part of the Hoysala Empire; in 1254 it was bestowed to Ramanatha, one of King Someshwara&#x27;s two sons. The Hoysala were defeated by the Vijayanagara Empire, which ruled Kolar from 1336 to 1664. During this period, the Sri Someshwara Temple at Kolar was built.

For 50 years in the 17th century Kolar was under Maratha rule as part of the Jagir of Shahaji, followed by 70 years of Muslim rule. In 1720 it became part of the Province of Sira, with Fateh Mohammed (the father of Hyder Ali) the province&#x27;s Faujdar. Kolar was then ruled by the Marathas, the Nawab of Cuddapah, the Nizam of Hyderabad and Hyder Ali. It was under British rule from 1768 to 1770 before a brief Maratha rule followed by Hyder Ali. In 1791 Lord Cornwallis conquered Kolar and returned it to the Kingdom of Mysore in the peace treaty of 1792.

In the Kolar region, inscriptions document the reigns of the Mahavalis (Baanaas), the Pallavas and the Vaidumbaas. Benjamin Lewis Rice recorded 1,347 inscriptions in the Kolar District, in the 10th volume of his &quot;Epigraphia Carnatica&quot;, of the inscriptions, 422 are in Tamil, 211 in Telugu. But the oldest are in Kannada. This was the original language. Tamil came in with the Cholas in the 11th century, and Telugu with Vijayanagar kings after the 15th. The period covered by the inscriptions is from 4th to the 18th century.

<text>Cordwood construction (also called cordwood masonry or cordwood building, alternatively stackwall or stovewood particularly in Canada) is a term used for a natural building method in which short logs are piled crosswise to build a wall, using mortar or cob to permanently secure them. This technique can be made to use a wide variety of locally available materials at minimal financial cost, and is a classic example of trading a higher raw labor requirement for technical ease and cost-efficiency of building (a common feature in back-to-the-land alternative/traditional building methods).

Walls are usually constructed so that the log ends protrude (are proud)from the mortar by a small amount (an inch or less). Walls typically range between 8 and 24 inches thick, though in northern Canada, some walls are as much as 36 inches thick.

Cordwood homes are attractive for their visual appeal, economy of resources, and ease of construction. Wood usually accounts for about 40-60% of the wall system, the remaining portion consisting of a mortar mix and insulating fill. Cordwood construction can be sustainable depending on design and process. There are two main types of cordwood construction, throughwall and M-I-M (mortar-insulation-mortar). In throughwall, the mortar mix itself contains an insulative material, usually sawdust, chopped newsprint, or paper sludge, in sometimes very high percentages by mass (80% paper sludge/20% mortar). In the more common M-I-M, and unlike brick or throughwall masonry, the mortar does not continue throughout the wall. Instead, three- or four-inch (sometimes more) beads of mortar on each side of the wall provide stability and support, with a separate insulation between them. Cordwood walls can be load-bearing (using built-up corners, or curved wall designed) or laid within a post and beam framework which provides structural reinforcement and is suitable for earthquake-prone areas. As a load-bearing wall, the compressive strength of wood and mortar allows for roofing to be tied directly into the wall. Different mortar mixtures and insulation fill material both affect the wall&#x27;s overall R value, or resistance to heat flow; and conversely, to its inherent thermal mass, or heat/cool storage capacity.

== History ==
Remains of cordwood structures still standing date back as far as one thousand years in eastern Germany. However, more contemporary versions could be found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. There is no detailed information about the origins of cordwood construction. However, it is plausible that forest dwellers eventually erected a basic shelter between a fire and a stacked wood pile. In the work of William Tischler of University of Wisconsin, he states that &quot;current&quot; cordwood probably started in the late 1800s in Quebec, Wisconsin, and Sweden. He believes that the technique started in these areas around the same time.

== Wood ==
Cordwood construction is an economical use of log ends or fallen trees in heavily timbered areas. Other common sources for wood include sawmills, split firewood, utility poles (without creosote), split rail fence posts, and logging slash. It is more sustainable and often economical to use recycled materials for the walls. Regardless of the source, all wood must be debarked before the construction begins. While many different types of wood can be used, the most desirable rot resistant woods are Pacific yew, bald cypress (new growth), cedars, and juniper. Acceptable woods also include Douglas fir, western larch, Eastern White Pine, and Spruce Pine.

Less dense and more airy woods are superior because they shrink and expand in lower proportions than dense hardwoods. Most wood can be used in a wall if it is dried properly and stabilized to the external climate&#x27;s relative humidity. Furthermore, while log ends of different species can be mixed in a wall, log-ends of identical species and source limit expansion/contraction variables.

== Mortar ==

Various experts advise different recipes for mortar mix. One recipe which has proven to be successful since 1981 is 9 parts sand, 3 sawdust, 3 builder&#x27;s lime (non-agricultural), 2 Portland cement by volume. Builder&#x27;s lime makes the wall more flexible, breathable, and self-healing because it takes longer to completely set than cement. Portland cement chemically binds the mortar and should be either Type I or II. Another recipe uses 3 parts sand, 2 soaked sawdust, 1 Portland Cement and 1 Hydrated Lime; intended to have the advantage of curing slower and displaying less cracking.

== Thermal mass and insulation ==
Depending on a variety of factors (wall thickness, type of wood, particular mortar recipe), the insulative value of a cordwood wall, as expressed in R-value is generally less than that of a high-efficiency stud wall. Cordwood walls have greater thermal mass than stud frame but less than common brick and mortar. This is because the specific heat capacity of clay brick is higher (0.84 versus wood&#x27;s 0.42), and is denser than airy woods like cedar, cypress, or pine. However, the insulated mortar matrix utilized in most cordwood walls places useful thermal mass on both sides of the insulated internal cavity, helping to store heat in winter and warm slowly in summer. Thermal mass makes it easier for a building to maintain median interior temperatures while going through daily hot and cold phases. In climates like the desert with broad daily temperature swings thermal mass will absorb and then slowly release the midday heat and nighttime cool in sequence, moderating temperature fluctuations. Thermal mass does not replace the function of insulation material, but is used in conjunction with it.

The longer the logs (and thicker the wall), the better the insulation qualities. A common 16” cordwood wall for moderate climates comprises of perlite or vermiculite insulation between mortar joints. Another insulation option, used for over 40 years by Rob Roy and other cordwood builders is dry sawdust, passed through a half-inch screen, and treated with builder&#x27;s (Type S) lime at the ratio of 12 parts sawdust to 1 part lime. With light airy sawdusts, this insulation is similar in its R-value to manufactured loose-fill insulations, at a fraction of the cost.

However, wood is an anisotropic material with respect to heat flow. That means its thermal resistance depends on the direction of heat flow relative to the wood grain. While wood has a commonly quoted R-value of about 1.25 per inch (depending on the species and moisture content), that only applies if the heat flow is perpendicular to the grain, such as occurs in common wood-frame construction. With cordwood/stackwall construction, the direction of heat flow is parallel to the grain. For this configuration, the R-value is only about 40% of that perpendicular to the grain. Thus, the actual R-value of wood, when used in cordwood/stackwall construction is closer to about 0.50 per inch.

But the R-value of a cordwood masonry wall must take into consideration both the wooden portion and the insulated mortar portion as a combined system. The only authoritative testing on the R-value of cordwood masonry was conducted by Dr. Kris J. Dick (PE) and Luke Chaput during the winter of 2004–2005, based on thermal sensors placed within a 24-inch thick wall at the University of Manitoba. A paper reporting on their findings appears in &quot;Cordwood and the Code: a building permit guide&quot; The authors&#x27; summary says, in part: &quot;Based on approximately three months of mid-winter temperature data, the wall was determined to have an RSI Value of 6.23 (m²K/W), R-35 for a 24-inch wall system.&quot;

A thermal performance analysis in 1998 using “HOT 2000” computer software showed the relationship of domestic wall types and their insulating values. The simulation revealed an R value of 20.5 for the sample cordwood wall. Compare this to the basic 2 x 4 wooden stud wall, and 2 x 6 foam insulated and sheathed wall with R values of 15.8 and 25.7, respectively. Cordwood walls are not the best natural insulators but can be built to thermal efficient standards. The R value of a cordwood wall is directly related to its ratio of wood to mortar and insulation medium. However, R value in cordwood construction is not as significant as it is in stick-frame building due to the high thermal mass which increases a significantly higher &quot;effective R-value.” Builders tailor their design and ratios to the existing climate.

R-value testing was completed at the University of Manitoba in the winter of 2005. The findings compiled by the Engineering Department, found that each inch of cordwood wall (mortar, log end and sawdust/lime insulation yielded an r-value of 1.47).

== Costs ==
A cordwood home can be constructed for significantly less initial out-of-pocket cost than a standard stick-frame house of comparable size, since sometimes labor is done primarily by the owner, or volunteers. Properly built cordwood walls tend to have fewer maintenance needs than standard stick-frame, because there are fewer manufactured components (e.g., fiberglass insulation, nailings, sidings, flashings, etc.). Some maintenance still will be required, as there is wood and concrete exposed to the elements on the exterior side of the wall. A cordwood house that is poorly built without sufficient insulation can result in higher heating costs than a traditional stud-frame house.

In a 1998 comparative economic analysis of stud frame, cordwood, straw bale, and cob, cordwood appeared to be an economically viable alternative. A two-story cordwood house in Cherokee, North Carolina outfitted with &quot;high quality tile, tongue and groove pine, Russian Woodstove, live earth roof, hand shaped cedar trim, raised panel cabinets, and a handmade pine door,&quot; cost the owner an estimated $52,000. With the owner providing 99% of the labor, the house cost him $20.70 per sq. ft. A comparably sized and furnished stick-frame house in 1998 would cost between $75,000-$120,000 with zero owner labor. The 1997 residential cost data shows an &quot;average&quot; trim level 1,000- house costing $64.48-$81.76 per sq. ft. Both the acquisition of materials and source of labor play major roles in the initial cost of building a cordwood house.

== Process ==
In certain jurisdictions construction plans are subject to the building inspector&#x27;s approval. Before building, soil conditions on the site must be verified to support heavy cordwood masonry walls.

With felled timber, bark should be removed in the spring with a shovel, chisel, or bark spud. The sap is still running in spring time and provides a lubricating layer of cambium between the bark and wood, making separation an easier task than if left until the fall when the two layers are well-bonded together. Once debarked, the logs should sit to dry for at least three summers to limit splitting and checking. It is important to cut the logs, once debarked to the chosen building length. Richard Flatau, &quot;Cordwood Construction: Best Practices&quot; (2012) suggest splitting 70% of the wood for better drying and seasoning.

After drying, the logs must be cut to the desired length (usually 8, 12, 16, 18, or 24 in.). In this case a metal handsaw is preferable to a chainsaw because its finer cut helps to ward moisture and pest penetration. Actually a &quot;cut off &quot; saw or &quot;buzz saw&quot; will make quick work of cutting cordwood into chosen lengths. For especially furry ends like on cedar, rasps can be used for smoothing.

The wood then needs to be transported to the building site. It is convenient to have the source of cordwood and construction site nearby. Once a proper foundation has been poured which rises 12-24 inches above ground level with a splash guard, construction of the walls can begin. Temporary shelters can be used to cover the worksite and cordwood from rain. A post and beam frame supplies this shelter for subsequent cordwood mortaring.

Inexperienced homebuilders should experiment with a number of practice walls. This will ultimately expedite the building process and provide more satisfying results. When experimenting with M-I-M, (the more common form), two parallel 3 to 4 inch beads of mortar are laid down along the foundation, followed by a middle filling of insulation material. Then logs are laid on top with consistent mortar gaps, protruding no more than 1 inch on the inside and outside of the wall. Actual placement will depend on the size and shapes of the logs. Another layer of mortar is spread, then insulation poured in between, more logs follow and so on. When experimenting with Throughwall, a thin, even layer of insulative mortar is laid along the foundation, then the logs are seated firmly in the mortar bed, in an even fashion, leaving only enough space between them to &quot;point&quot; the mortar. The mortar gaps are filled to make a relatively flat top surface, then another thin layer of mortar is added and the process repeats. The shape and exterior orientation of logs is important only for appearance. Pre-split “firewood style” logs check less when in the wall and are easier to &quot;point&quot; or smooth and press evenly around than round pieces because the mortar gaps are generally smaller. 

Rob and Jaki Roy, co-directors of Earthwood Building School in West Chazy, NY for 36 years, take a different point of view. They used to use mostly split wood, but now use mostly white cedar (or equal) rounds. The shrinkage is exactly the same in splits and rounds, and the Roys have found the wood easier to lay up because it more readily holds its shape from one side of the wall to the other. Further, the rounds are easier to point, because of the ragged edge that results on the bottom side of a split log. Finally, the greater amount of mortar using rounds is actually a plus because the mortared portion of the wall performs better, thermally, than the wooden portion.

If constructing a house with corners, each course of cordwood should be cross hatched for strength. Near the end, small filler slats of wood may be required to finish the joining or tops of walls. Windows and doors are framed with standard window boxes and wooden lintels. Glass bottles can be inserted for a creative stained glass effect. (Plumbing and electrical wiring are issues to consider but will not be elaborated on in this article).

A cordwood house should have deep overhanging eaves of at least 12- 16 inches to keep the log ends dry and prevent fungal growth. If the ends are maintained to be dry and well aerated, they will age without problem. Some owners have coated their ends with linseed oil, or set the outside log ends flush with the mortar for further weatherproofing. Over time, some checking is normal, and can be remedied with periodic mortar or caulking maintenance.

== Sustainability ==
Although cordwood homes have been tested in -40F locations like Alberta, their thermal efficiency in any climate is below that of a purely cob house of comparable dimensions. In frigid areas it is appropriate to either build a thicker 24-36 inch wall, or two separate super insulated walls. In predominantly wet areas, the outside walls can be plastered, smothering the cordwood ends from air and moisture, but this hides cordwood&#x27;s attractive log ends and the logs will rot. The quantity of labor relative to gaining a specific R value for cordwood is higher when compared to straw bale and stick frame construction. Funds saved in construction may need to be allocated for heating costs or longterm exterior maintenance. An organic, mortar-like cob creates less of an environmental impact because of the use of readily available mud and straw, whereas toxins emitted during the production of Portland cement are very harmful, albeit less tangible in the final product. Like many alternative building styles, the sustainability of cordwood construction is dependent upon materials and construction variables.

Following the Cordwood Conference in 2005 at Merrill, Wisconsin, a document was published to address best practices in cordwood construction and building code compliance. The document entitled &quot;Cordwood and the Code: A Building Permit Guide&quot; assists cordwood builders get the necessary code permits.

<doc id="695746" wikidata="Q7348577" url="?curid=695746" title="Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language">
<text>Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language is a 1982 book by philosopher of language Saul Kripke in which he contends that the central argument of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; centers on a skeptical rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is &quot;the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date&quot; (p. 60). He argues that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a &quot;skeptical solution&quot; to alleviate the paradox&#x27;s destructive effects.

==Kripkenstein: Kripke&#x27;s skeptical Wittgenstein==
While most commentators accept that the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, few have concurred in attributing Kripke&#x27;s skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. Kripke expresses doubts in &quot;Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language&quot; as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. He says that his book should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate summary of Wittgenstein&#x27;s views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein&#x27;s argument &quot;as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him&quot; (p. 5). The portmanteau &quot;Kripkenstein&quot; has been coined as a term for a fictional person who holds the views expressed by Kripke&#x27;s reading of the &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;; in this way, it is convenient to speak of Kripke&#x27;s own views, Wittgenstein&#x27;s views (as generally understood), and Kripkenstein&#x27;s views. Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke&#x27;s book the most influential and widely discussed work on Wittgenstein from the 1980s onward.

== The rule-following paradox ==
In &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; §201a Wittgenstein states the rule-following paradox: &quot;This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule&quot;. 

Kripke gives a mathematical example to illustrate the reasoning that leads to this conclusion. Suppose that you have never added numbers greater than or equal to 57 before. Further, suppose that you are asked to perform the computation 68 + 57. Our natural inclination is that you will apply the addition function as you have before, and calculate that the correct answer is 125. But now imagine that a bizarre skeptic comes along and argues:

# That there is no fact about your past usage of the addition function that determines 125 as the right answer.
# That nothing justifies you in giving this answer rather than another.

After all, the skeptic reasons, by hypothesis you have never added numbers 57 or greater before. It is perfectly consistent with your previous use of &quot;plus&quot; that you actually meant &quot;quus&quot;, defined as:

::formula_1

Thus under the quus function, if either of the two numbers added is 57 or greater, the sum is 5. The skeptic argues that there is no fact that determines that you ought to answer 125 rather than 5, as all your prior addition is compatible with the quus function instead of the plus function, for you have never added a number greater than or equal to 57 before. 

Further, your past usage of the addition function is susceptible to an infinite number of different quus-like interpretations. It appears that every new application of &quot;plus&quot;, rather than being governed by a strict, unambiguous rule, is actually a leap in the dark.

Similar skeptical reasoning can be applied to the meaning of any word of any human language. The power of Kripke&#x27;s example is that in mathematics the rules for the use of expressions appear to be defined clearly for an infinite number of cases. Kripke doesn&#x27;t question the mathematical validity of the &quot;+&quot; function, but rather the meta-linguistic usage of &quot;plus&quot;: what fact can we point to that shows that &quot;plus&quot; refers to the mathematical function &quot;+&quot;? 

If we assume for the sake of argument that &quot;plus&quot; refers to the function &quot;+&quot;, the skeptical problem simply resurfaces at a higher level. The addition algorithm itself will contain terms susceptible to different and incompatible interpretations. In short, rules for interpreting rules provide no help, because they themselves can be interpreted in different ways. Or, as Wittgenstein puts it, &quot;any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; §198a).

== The skeptical solution ==

Following David Hume, Kripke distinguishes between two types of solution to skeptical paradoxes. Straight solutions dissolve paradoxes by rejecting one (or more) of the premises that lead to them. Skeptical solutions accept the truth of the paradox, but argue that it does not undermine our ordinary beliefs and practices in the way it seems to. Because Kripke thinks that Wittgenstein endorses the skeptical paradox, he is committed to the view that Wittgenstein offers a skeptical, and not a straight, solution.

The rule-following paradox threatens our ordinary beliefs and practices concerning meaning because it implies that there is no such thing as meaning something by an expression or sentence. John McDowell explains this as follows. We are inclined to think of meaning in contractual terms: that is, that meanings commit or oblige us to use words in a certain way. When you grasp the meaning of the word &quot;dog&quot;, for example, you know that you ought to use that word to refer to dogs, and not cats. But if there cannot be rules governing the uses of words, as the rule-following paradox apparently shows, this intuitive notion of meaning is utterly undermined.

Kripke holds that other commentators on &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; have believed that the private language argument is presented in sections occurring after §243. Kripke reacts against this view, noting that the conclusion to the argument is explicitly stated by §202, which reads “Hence it is not possible to obey a rule ‘privately’: otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same as obeying it.” Further, in this introductory section, Kripke identifies Wittgenstein&#x27;s interests in the philosophy of mind as related to his interests in the foundations of mathematics, in that both subjects require considerations about rules and rule-following.

Kripke&#x27;s skeptical solution is this: A language-user&#x27;s following a rule correctly is not justified by any fact that obtains about the relationship between their candidate application of a rule in a particular case and the putative rule itself (as for Hume the causal link between two events &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is not determined by any particular fact obtaining between them &quot;taken in isolation&quot;); rather, the assertion that the rule that is being followed is justified by the fact that the behaviors surrounding the candidate instance of rule-following (by the candidate rule-follower) meet other language users&#x27; expectations. That the solution is not based on a fact about &quot;a particular instance&quot; of putative rule-following—as it would be if it were based on some mental state of meaning, interpretation, or intention—shows that this solution is skeptical in the sense Kripke specifies.

==The &quot;straight&quot; solution==
In contrast to the kind of solution offered by Kripke (above) and Crispin Wright (elsewhere), McDowell interprets Wittgenstein as correctly (by McDowell&#x27;s lights) offering a &quot;straight solution&quot;. McDowell argues that Wittgenstein does present the paradox (as Kripke argues), but he argues further that Wittgenstein rejects the paradox on the grounds that it assimilates understanding and interpretation. In order to understand something, we must have an interpretation. That is, to understand what is meant by &quot;plus&quot;, we must first have an interpretation of what &quot;plus&quot; means. This leads one to either skepticism—how do you know your interpretation is the correct interpretation?—or relativity, whereby our understandings, and thus interpretations, are only so determined insofar as we have used them. On this latter view, endorsed by Wittgenstein in Wright&#x27;s readings, there are no facts about numerical addition that we have so far not discovered, so when we come upon such situations, we can flesh out our interpretations further. According to McDowell, both of these alternatives are rather unsatisfying, the latter because we want to say that there are facts about numbers that have not yet been added.

McDowell further writes that to understand rule-following we should understand it as resulting from inculcation into a custom or practice. Thus, to understand addition is simply to have been inculcated into a practice of adding. This position is often called &quot;anti-antirealism&quot;, meaning that he argues that the result of sceptical arguments, like that of the rule-following paradox, is to tempt philosophical theory into realism, thereby making bold metaphysical claims. Since McDowell offers a straight solution, making the rule-following paradox compatible with realism would be missing Wittgenstein&#x27;s basic point that the meaning can often be said to be the use. This is in line with quietism, the view that philosophical theory results only in dichotomies and that the notion of a theory of meaning is pointless.

==Semantic realism and Kripkenstein==
George M. Wilson argues that there is a way to lay out Kripkenstein as a philosophical position compatible with semantic realism: by differentiating between two sorts of conclusions resulting from the rule-following paradox, illustrated by a speaker S using a term T:

BSC (Basic Sceptical Conclusion): There are no facts about S that fix any set of properties as the standard of correctness for S&#x27;s use of T.

RSC (Radical Sceptical Conclusion): No one ever means anything by any term.

Wilson argues that Kripke&#x27;s sceptic is indeed committed to RSC, but that Kripke reads Wittgenstein as embracing BSC but refuting RSC. This, Wilson argues, is done with the concept of familiarity. When S uses T, its correctness is determined neither by a fact about S (hereby accepting the rule-following paradox) nor a correspondence between T and the object termed (hereby denying the idea of correspondence theory), but the irreducible fact that T is grounded in familiarity, being used to predicate other similar objects. This familiarity is independent of and, in some sense, external to S, making familiarity the grounding for semantic realism.

Still, Wilson&#x27;s suggested realism is minimal, partly accepting McDowell&#x27;s critique.

<text>&quot;Popcorn&quot; (first version &quot;Pop Corn&quot;) is an instrumental song composed by Gershon Kingsley in 1969 for the album &quot;Music to Moog By&quot;. It was performed on the Moog synthesizer and released on the Audio Fidelity label. The name is a combination of &quot;pop&quot; for pop music and &quot;corn&quot; for kitsch. The song became a worldwide hit in 1972, when it was covered by Hot Butter, an American pop band. Since then, multiple versions of the piece have been produced and released, including those by Vyacheslav Mescherin, Anarchic System, Popcorn Makers, the Boomtang Boys, M &amp; H Band, Crazy Frog, and the Muppets.

== Hot Butter version ==
In 1972, a rearranged version of the instrumental was recorded by Kingsley&#x27;s First Moog Quartet. This was intended for the namesake album (&quot;First Moog Quartet&quot;) which had been otherwise a re-release of the 1970 First Moog Quartet album with the same name. The 1972 version of the instrumental had the current title &quot;Popcorn&quot;. In the same year, Stan Free, a fellow member of the First Moog Quartet, re-recorded another instrumental, based on the 1972 version, with his own band Hot Butter. This was released as a single and became a hit in mainland Europe, spending several weeks at No. 1 in several countries on the continent, including France (4 weeks at the top) and Switzerland (10 weeks), ultimately becoming the biggest-selling single of 1972 in both countries. &quot;Popcorn&quot; was also a No. 1 hit in Germany (3 weeks), the Netherlands (7 weeks) and Norway (9 weeks).

&quot;Record World&quot; said that the &quot;catchy tune played out in intricate synthesizer counterpoint expands on a musical idea first brought out in the popular percolater commercials on TV.&quot;

== Crazy Frog version ==
In 2005, Crazy Frog released a cover of &quot;Popcorn&quot;, the remix of which was arranged by Jamba!, and also marketed as a ringtone. The song differs from Crazy Frog&#x27;s debut release &quot;Axel F&quot; in that it does not contain the trademark &quot;Crazy Frog sound&quot; by Daniel Malmedahl.

The single was a hit in various countries, particularly in France, where it enjoyed its greatest success. Replacing Crazy Frog&#x27;s own song &quot;Axel F&quot; at No. 1 on 24 September 2005, the track remained at the top spot for seven weeks, with its best weekly sales of 71,777 copies in its second week. Certified diamond status just three months after its release by the SNEP, as of August 2014, this version of &quot;Popcorn&quot; is the 40th best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 458,000 copies sold. The track also topped the charts in Belgium, New Zealand and Spain.

The animated music video was produced by Kaktus Film and Erik Wernquist of TurboForce3D and features Crazy Frog causing chaos at the undersea labs of the drones. A significantly shortened version of this video was also used for the Frog&#x27;s version of &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
French electronic composer and musician Jean-Michel Jarre recorded a 1972 version under the pseudonyms &quot;Pop Corn Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Jammie Jefferson&quot;. Later he was inspired by this song to compose his 1976 biggest hit Oxygène (Part IV). In early 2019, when Kingsley died, the experimental composer Blanck Mass chose &quot;Popcorn&quot; as one of the 10 most influential compositions of his career.

== Other versions ==
The 1972 cover by the Popcorn Makers reached No. 7 on the German charts and No. 1 on the Dutch Charts. The version with vocals by French band Anarchic System was released in 1972 and reached at No. 13 on the German charts, No. 10 on the Dutch charts and No. 1 on the Ultratop 50. 

In 1987, the French M &amp; H Band (sole member Mark Haliday), released a version of &quot;Popcorn&quot; which peaked at No. 8 on the Norwegian charts and at No. 20 on the Swedish charts. This single&#x27;s release was accompanied by the first purpose-produced music video. Canadian group the Boomtang Boys covered &quot;Popcorn&quot; in 1999, their version peaked at No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart, where it stayed for 9 weeks. It also reached No. 10 on &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Canadian dance chart. Richárd Moldován known as &quot;Richi M&quot; released in the 2000 year a cover version which reached at No. 9 on the Swedish charts.

==In popular culture==
In a comical reference, a version of the song was included in the 2010 skit by The Muppets called &quot;Pöpcørn: Recipes with The Swedish Chef.&quot; In 2022, Swedish singer Tove Lo sampled the Hot Butter version in her single &quot;2 Die 4&quot;.

<doc id="695753" wikidata="Q375074" url="?curid=695753" title="Nissan Violet">
<text>The Nissan Violet is a compact car that was first released in Japan in 1973 and produced until 1992. It was initially exclusive to Nissan&#x27;s Japanese &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; dealerships, as a larger companion to the Nissan Cherry.

In 1977 the second generation arrived. This was split into two additional lines, the Nissan Auster and the Nissan Stanza. All three models bore the A10 series identifier, and were built in Japan at the Hiratsuka and Yokosuka assembly plants. The Stanza was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; as a larger companion to the smaller Nissan Sunny, and the Auster triplet was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations as a larger companion to the Nissan Langley.

A new third generation front-wheel drive model was launched in 1981, changing the series name again to T11, and sharing its platform with the Compact MPV Nissan Prairie/Multi/Stanza Wagon. Final versions were Nissan Bluebirds series U12 rebadged for some international markets. In most export markets the car was originally sold as the Datsun 140J or 160J depending on the engine; this name was then gradually changed to Nissan Stanza in most markets in line with Nissan&#x27;s phasing out of the Datsun brand in its export markets in the early 1980s; in Europe for instance it was sold as the &quot;Datsun-Nissan Stanza&quot; for a short time until the Datsun name was dropped completely in 1984.

The Stanza/Auster/Violet were discontinued in 1992. The Stanza was replaced by the Nissan Altima in North America; the Stanza was replaced by the Nissan Bluebird in Japan, and by the Primera in Europe.


== 710 series (1973–1977)==
Introduced in January 1971 the Nissan Violet was a smaller version of the Datsun Bluebird 610, which was sold outside Japan under Nissan&#x27;s Datsun brand as the Datsun 140J/160J — except in the United States where it was marketed simply as the Datsun 710. This model was built as a two-door saloon, two-door coupé, four-door fastback, (and later as a regular four-door saloon), estate, and as a van. Introducing the Violet allowed Nissan to moderately increase the dimensions of the existing Datsun Bluebird.

The sporty SSS model has rear independent suspension, others have a leaf sprung rear. Aside from the different name, the North American market 710 received large separate bumpers rather than the curved, fitted pieces used in other markets to comply with United States bumper legislation in 1973. Early export market cars were fitted with tiny chrome cover plates to hide the holes left on top of the front fenders by the Japanese market rear view mirrors. The most powerful version offered in Japan was the fuel injected 1600 SSS-E with JIS at 6200 rpm. In export markets the twin-carb 160J SSS claimed DIN, five more than the regular 160J. In Japan, the 1800 cc engine arrived in October 1975 and was only available running on LPG, for taxi use.
This vehicle was available for sale around the same time as the first generation Toyota Carina. The original four-door bodywork was quite swoopy, with a fastback line. It was one of the first Nissan products to introduce &quot;coke bottle styling&quot;, an appearance that had debuted internationally during the 1960s and 1970s. Its appearance was controversial, which led to a certain number of customer complaints at the limited rear vision and dark rear cabin - especially for children. Taxi companies refused to purchase any more Violets, and in a rather drastic facelift gradually introduced beginning in February 1976 Nissan replaced the entire rear end (including the roof panel and the doors) with more traditional, notchback bodywork. This provided more space and comfort for passengers, while also minimizing blind spots.

This version also received a new chassis code, 711, while the smaller-engined part of the range gradually became replaced by the newly introduced, carburetted version of the 1600. The two-door versions did not undergo this modification: The two-door sedan was discontinued, while the coupé received the new chassis code and remained on sale alongside the four-door 711 and the 710 Van.

;North America
In the United States and Canada, the car was sold simply as the &quot;Datsun 710&quot;. Two- or four-door sedans, a two-door coupé, and a five-door station wagon were available. Introduced for the 1974 model year, the 710 switched from the original 1770 cc, engine to the 2-litre L20B engine also used in the 610. The 1975s produce (SAE Net) in 49-state and Canadian trim versus California-spec cars. The federal/Canadian version took leaded fuel and depended on an EGR system for pollution control, while the California cars have a catalytic converter and require unleaded petrol. Gross horsepower ratings are 110 and 107 respectively. Aside from the new engine, the 710 saw some additional modifications for 1975: the steering was adjusted to decrease driver effort, while noise levels were reduced, and gear ratios were adjusted to boost petrol mileage. Externally, the bumper overriders received a slight chrome molding in the middle.

Mysteriously, while wagons usually have a smaller petrol tank of rather than , the California-market 710 wagon has the same size petrol tank as the sedans and hardtops.

===Foreign assembly===

;Taiwan
In Taiwan the Violet was introduced in 1973 under the name &quot;Yue Loong Violet 707&quot; and replaced the successful Datsun Bluebird there. It remained in production until 1982 The Yue Loong Violet was usually offered with the OHV J16 engine. The VIP Brougham was a luxury version of the Violet with leather seats and wood interior.

;Mexico
For the Mexican domestic car market, the 710-series Violet was produced from 1973 to 1978 at Nissan&#x27;s CIVAC assembly plant, near Cuernavaca, Mexico. At the time, Nissan Mexico offered a unique passenger-vehicles lineup, the Datsun Bluebird range (the 510-series and the 410, previously), integrated only by the 4-door saloon and Wagon versions of the Bluebird, respectively commercialized as the Datsun Sedan and Datsun Guayín (Guayín is a moniker in Mexican spanish for &quot;Station Wagon&quot;). In 1974, going on with the same business strategy, the 710-series Violet was introduced to the Mexican car market badged as the new Datsun 160J, the replacement for the single-offered Bluebird lineup.

The Mexican 710 Violet range was integrated only by the 4-door Saloon alongside the Wagon, lacking the sporty 2-door/coupe bodies offered in some other countries. The fastback-styled 710 4-door saloon design was marketed from 1974 to 1977, being replaced in 1978 with the notchback-styled 711 Violet (which intended to improve the fastback&#x27;s bad rear visibility complained by some customers). All Mexican 710 Violets featured the 1.6-litre carbureted engine (160J), coupled to a 4-speed manual gearbox, and an optional 3-speed automatic gearbox starting in 1978.

From a time in the Mexican popular slang, sometimes this car is referred to as &quot;bolillo&quot;, the spanish word for a bread roll, due to its similar rounded shape.

For 1979, the 710 range was superseded by the correspondent next generation A10-series Violet in the Nissan Mexico lineup.

;New Zealand
New Zealand, as a result of the government&#x27;s temporary lift of import licensing restrictions (the result of high consumer demand for cars, which local CKD assemblers and built-up importers could not meet with the usual licensing restrictions and high import duties of up to 55%, plus sales tax up to 60%) saw considerable CBU imports of the Datsun 140J four-door sedan and 160J two-door during 1973 and 1974.

Due to the short notice and short timeframe of the licence requirement relaxation, the cars imported differed slightly in specification from shipment to shipment - some had Japanese market amber front park lights, front guard-mounted exterior rear view mirrors and &#x27;Violet&#x27; badges; later units had clear lenses and 140J/160J badging.

Several hundred 140J sedans entered New Zealand through the Port of Timaru for the South Island market and all were presold before they arrived. All were keenly sought-after and hard to secure as they were better specified as standard (tinted glass, AM pushbutton radio, etc.) than the NZ-assembled CKD kit imported models, which consisted of the 1200 sedan and wagon, and 180B (Bluebird) and 260C (Cedric) sedans.

Almost-new 140Js were often resold soon after first registration for hundreds of dollars more than their retail prices, such was the model line&#x27;s initial popularity. The Japanese assembly quality of the 140J was better than the NZ-built Datsuns of the time which were assembled by outside assembly contractors - Nissan themselves did not open its own &#x27;temporary&#x27; plant in Mt Roskill, Auckland, until the mid-1970s and a dedicated, purpose-built factory in Wiri in 1978.

;South Africa
In South Africa, the 1976 &quot;711&quot; facelift arrived in October 1976 and continued in production for a while longer than in Japan. It was sold as the Datsun 160U or 180U, depending on engine fitment. Deluxe and SSS sedans as well as an SSS Hardtop were available. A batch of 100 SSS models (some of which were Bluebirds) with special &quot;Mexican&quot; upholstery was also built in 1978.

== A10 series (1977–1981)==
The previous generation Violet grew more rational and somewhat larger when it was replaced in May 1977. Nissan increased the glass area by ten percent vis-à-vis its predecessor. It was also joined by two badge engineered versions: the went on sale alongside the Violet and was aiming for an air of &quot;quality and youthfulness.&quot; The Stanza followed in August and was meant to be more luxurious; it was only offered in the higher equipment levels and was also differentiated by having a different bonnet and single rectangular lights rather than the twin round units seen on the Violet and Auster. The Nissan Auster, which is named for the Latin equivalent of the Greek god &quot;Notus&quot; for the south wind, was available at &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot;; Stanza, which is Italian for &quot;room&quot; or &quot;apartment&quot;, was introduced as an affordable family car one level above the Nissan Sunny, sold at Nissan Japan dealerships &quot;Nissan Saito Store&quot;. The third version (Violet) was sold at dealerships called &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; locations. In Australia, it was called the Datsun Stanza, and in Canada and the United States it was the Datsun 510, a name which recalled the successes of the previous Datsun 510.
Originally it was only sold with the 1.4-litre A-series engine (not available in the Stanza) and the 1.6-litre L, although North American market cars received a two-litre version. In May 1978 the car underwent a facelift, becoming the A11 in the process. At the same time, the L16 engines were replaced by the cross-flow Z16, to meet newer stricter emissions rules. Nissan introduced their emissions control technology with this generation, called NAPS, and the cars received a new chassis code of A11. The more luxurious Stanza was never available with the 1.4-litre engine in Japan, only with a 1.6 until larger engines joined the lineup.
In November 1978 a 1.8-litre engine was added at the top of the line-up, mainly for the domestic Japanese market. The 1800 &quot;NAPS-Z&quot; engine was initially only available in the more luxurious Stanza model and received the RA11 chassis code. It was available either carburetted or fuel injected, with at 6,000 rpm respectively.

Five body styles were on offer: two- and four-door saloons, a three-door hatchback coupé (&quot;Violet Openback&quot; and &quot;Auster Multi-Coupé&quot;), a 5-door hatchback (only introduced in August 1979, quite late in the car&#x27;s production run) and a five-door estate.

The five-door liftback Stanza was marketed as the &quot;Stanza Resort&quot; in the Japanese domestic market, and given the chassis model code T10. The five-door bodywork only became available in the Auster and Violet versions as of April 1980, meaning that they were only built for fourteen months as the car was replaced by the T11 generation in June 1981. The A10/A11 wagon was not replaced in 1981, with the all-new Nissan Prairie or Nissan Vanette instead filling its place for cargo carrying duties in the Japanese market.

Transmissions offered were a four-speed manual (in all except for the hatchback models), a five-speed manual (hatchback models only), and a three-speed automatic. This generation was available for sale around the same time as the first generation Toyota Celica Camry and the Honda Accord, which formed direct competitors in the domestic marketplace.

===Export markets===
====Australia====

The Stanza was assembled in Australia from 1978 to 1982, in four-door 1.6-litre four-door saloon form, primarily to fill a gap between the Sunny and 200B. Trims available were &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;GX&quot;, and sporty &quot;SSS&quot;.

While popular with buyers, the Australian Stanza was heavily criticized by the motoring journalists of the day (particularly Wheels Magazine), who regarded the car as being &quot;unadventurous&quot;, particularly with regard to its styling and conventional drivetrain.

In 1979, 120 two-door coupé models were assembled in Australia, apparently due to a mix-up with Nissan Australia&#x27;s kit ordering system. They were released into the market anyway with no promotion, and promptly sold out.

====New Zealand====
The A10 series was sold in limited numbers as the Datsun 160J in New Zealand. A batch of three-door hatchbacks were imported when assemblers could not keep up with demand with the locally assembled 120Y Sunny and 180B models.

====Europe====
In the United Kingdom, this generation was marketed as the Datsun Violet, and was sold in 1.4 L &quot;GL&quot; and 1.6 L &quot;GL&quot; engine/trim combinations. No estate models were offered. In the rest of Europe it was usually sold as the 160J (or 140J), a variety of bodystyle and equipment combinations were offered, with a Coupé SSS with twin SU-carburetors available at the top of the lineup. Power outputs were for the 140J, for the 160J, and for the 160J SSS. A fuel-injected version of the 160J was also available in some European markets, with .

====Taiwan====
The A10 Violet was locally assembled in Taiwan by Yue Loong until at least 1985. It was sold as the YLN 709, 711, and 712, depending on which facelift version. In later years (as the 712) it was only available with hatchback bodywork and a 1.4-litre engine.

====Thailand====
In Thailand it was marketed as the Datsun Stanza (with additional Nissan badges during the transition period) by local assembler Siam Motors. It was only available with SU-carburetted 1.6-litre engines, producing SAE in the four-door sedan and in the sportier liftback coupé version.

====Mexico====

The A10-series Violet was commercialized in the Mexican car market from 1978 to early 1984. Introduced as a 1979 model, it superseded the previous 710-series as the second generation &quot;Datsun 160J&quot;. At first, the Mexican A10 Violet range only included the 4-door saloon and the Wagon, being (as previously) respectively marketed as &quot;Datsun Sedan&quot; and &quot;Datsun Guayin&quot; (badged Violet Van in Japan), continuing the former promotion strategy of the Nissan Mexico lineup. For the first time here, the 2-door saloon version was added to the range.

From 1979 to 1981, the Mexican-produced A10 units had pretty much the same design of the Japanese-spec A10 Violets produced between the 1977-1979 lapse. The front grille of the 4-door and wagon featured the same doubled-circle headlight set (i.e. two pair of circular lamps), while the 2-door saloon sported a distinctive front grille, with only a set of single circular right and left lamps.

For 1982, the Mexican A10 cars sported the same facelift works made on the 1979-1981 Japanese-produced Violets, going on a bit with the North American-spec A10 units (marketed in the USA as Datsun 510, hinting then the well-gained reputation of the former 510-series Bluebird model of the late 60s-early 70s). This slight facelift focused majorly on the updated front grille, featuring a singled or doubled set of new squared or rectangular-shaped headlights. From here, the commercialization of the Mexican A10 lineup changed to Datsun 180J, referring the more powerful 1.8-litre carbureted engine swap.

Also in 1982, the 5-door liftback/hatchback version of the A10 Violet certainly was launched toward the Mexican market, as Datsun Samurai. It intended to be a sleek, sporty while -by then- modern style saloon in the Nissan Mexico lineup.
In 1984, in a context of the Nissan&#x27;s brand global name unification, the Datsun brand name was phased out off the world&#x27;s market, in favor of the single Nissan brand name. Thus, the Mexican A10 Violet production was phased out by Nissan Mexico, switching its manufacture to the domestic market production of the B11 Sunny/Sentra range by then, launched as the all-new Nissan Tsuru (1st. gen / B11).

====North America====
In the United States and Canada the Violet was sold as the Datsun 510, to cash in on the popularity of the earlier 510 Bluebird. It was available as a two-door sedan, a three-door hatchback, a four-door sedan, a five-door hatchback, or a five-door wagon. It was powered by the 2.0 L inline-four L20B engine, although in 1980 US-spec. cars received the Z20S NAPS-Z inline-four of the same displacement. For the 1980 and 1981 model years, this was the only engine available to the 510. Power is at 5,200 rpm. The four-speed manual was standard in the A10 models while the FS5W63A five-speed manual or 3N71B three-speed automatic were available as optional upgrades.
====South Africa====
South African-made Violets were sold as the 1600J or 1800J depending on engine fitment between 1978 and 1980. Four-door saloon or station wagon bodywork was available, with the 1800 sedan also available as a sporting SSS model.
===Motorsports===

The Violet 160J was Nissan&#x27;s most successful car in the World Rally Championship. It won the Safari Rally in Kenya from 1979 to 1982 consecutively, all with Shekhar Mehta behind the wheel. The 1979 and 1980 winners were powered by an SOHC engine; the 1981 and 1982 winners were Violet GT models with a DOHC engine. These Safari records are only matched by the Toyota Celica GT-Four which won the 1992–95 events. Driven by Timo Salonen, the Violet also won the 1980 Rally New Zealand and the 1981 Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. In 1982 Nissan homologated the Nissan Silvia coupé as a bodystyle variant of the Violet, under the name Nissan Violet GTS, which can cause confusion between the competition histories of these two cars.
====WRC victories====

== T11 series (1981–1986)==
A front-wheel drive Stanza was introduced in 1981 – the first middle-class Datsun to be of that configuration, and the first Japanese car in the category built to the principles which had been established in Europe for this class since a few years back. In Europe, front-wheel drive and a liftback design were becoming the norm in this segment, although more traditional Japanese buyers still preferred the rear-wheel drive Bluebird. It remained on sale in Britain until 1986, after which Nissan sold the first British-built Bluebird as its only product in this market sector. Nissan was previously building a smaller, front wheel drive car, beginning with the 1970 Nissan Cherry, and then reconfigured the Violet to front wheel drive. 3-door hatchback, 4-door saloon, and 5-door liftback models were produced.

After 1982, Nissan tried to standardize the Stanza name in its export markets – in addition to phasing out the Datsun marque in favor of Nissan. In the United States the T11 Stanza with the CA20S engine replaced the 510 for the 1982 model year. In the United States, the Nissan Prairie was also sold as part of the range, renamed the Stanza Wagon. In 1984, Nissan changed the engine in the Stanza from the carbureted CA20S to the fuel-injected 2.0 L, straight-four CA20E. This car was 1981 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland. Japanese and some other export models were called &quot;Stanza FX&quot;, and were offered with 1.6 and 1.8 L engines.

This version was sold in the United Kingdom and Europe as the Nissan Stanza; the range was &quot;L&quot; 1.6 L, &quot;GL&quot; 1.6 L, &quot;SGL&quot; 1.6 L and &quot;SGL&quot; 1.8 L. Some markets (such as Belgium, where it came fitted with the full SGL equipment) also received a 1.7-litre turbodiesel engine with , beginning with the 1984 model year. European market cars were generally fitted with very long gearing, making the car one of the most fuel economic in its class. It was first sold in Britain from January 1982, alongside the similar-sized rear-wheel drive Bluebird saloons and estates, which later also switched to front-wheel drive. This meant that Nissan was in the position of offering traditional rear-wheel drive saloons and estates alongside similar-sized front-wheel drive cars including hatchbacks, as this market sector was in a period of transition in the early 1980s.
Nissan-Datsun New Zealand occasionally imported later generation Violets and other models for evaluation, or imported a small production run if additional import licences became available (there was a trading scheme enabling importers to trade unused annual license allocations with each other). One highly specified, five-door, third generation, front-drive model with automatic transmission - and then-rare air conditioning - was imported for an international distributors&#x27; conference held in NZ in 1981 and was later used by a company executive&#x27;s wife before being resold through the company&#x27;s own dealer network. There was also a small later shipment of cars for public sale (this time without a/c) but, as usual with low-volume imports of this type by Nissan and rivals, most were presold before the ship docked. A number of Stanzas also arrived as used imports from Japan in the late 1980s.

In Indonesia, the T11 Stanza 1.6 L was a popular car taxi in the mid-1980s.

The facelifted Japanese models have an upright nose, similar to that of the Bluebird U11 series. The Stanza was available in Japan at &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; locations, while its badge engineered companion was sold as the five-door hatchback from 1981-1982, then replaced by the smaller Pulsar based three-door hatchback. The Violet Liberta was sold at &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; locations but only as a five door hatchback.
The Auster was a higher specification and sportier version of the Stanza for the Japanese domestic market, with the emphasis towards a younger demographic. The three-door hatchback Auster GT-ES was equipped with a five-speed manual transmission. Various trim packages were labeled, 1600 CS-X, Auster JX, GS-X Extra, and the 1800 GS-L Super Saloon. The Auster was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations, as a lower cost alternative to the Skyline, but was slightly larger than the Nissan Langley.

The Stanza T11 series was the only time in the US market that a Nissan was rated more-reliable than the Toyota Camry, between 1983 and 1986, according to 1983-1986 Consumer Reports magazine. In early years, Toyota had major problems with the Camry&#x27;s mufflers. Since 1987, Nissan have again fallen behind to Toyota and Honda in reliability.

The Stanza nameplate was discontinued in Europe after the 1986 model year, and rebadged as a &quot;Bluebird.&quot;

;Derivatives
In Taiwan a car closely based on the T11 Nissan Stanza got the name &quot;Yue Loong Feeling 101&quot; and in a facelifted version &quot;Yue Loong Feeling 102&quot;. Both were available as a sedan and in a hatchback variant. The vehicles later got an aggressive redesign with angled headlights and more sporty rearlamps. These versions were the first indigenously developed Taiwanese cars and were even exported in small numbers.


== T12 series (1986–1990)==


Nissan renewed the Auster and Stanza lines in 1986 (T12 series), introducing squared-off styling. Japan and the US received this model. The US Stanza used the same CA20E engine found in the previous generation. The car was unusually heavy for its class, due to sharing a platform with the contemporary Maxima and as a result of its small engine, underpowered. In part to offset this, some export markets offered turbocharged models, badged &quot;Supremo&quot;; and a cousin, the &quot;Auster XTT&quot;.

Europe received a version of the Nissan Auster as a Datsun/Nissan Bluebird replacement. These were built in Sunderland, in the United Kingdom, and badged as the Nissan Bluebird. The estate was the only &quot;real&quot; Bluebird in this range, imported from Japan.

In the Middle East, the T12 Auster/Stanza T12 was called the Nissan Liberta (not to be confused with the Nissan Liberta Villa), a partial replacement of the Nissan Liberta Violet T11.

The Stanza line was not seen in most other export markets after the 1986 model year. The growth of the Sunny and Pulsar models from below meant there was little room for it.

===Bluebird (Europe)===
The T12 was introduced in Europe in 1985 as a replacement for the U11 Bluebird. From July 1986, the T12 was imported as a knock-down kit from Japan and assembled at Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK. The saloon versions (four door) were available first and the hatchback (five door) became available in January 1987. Using the U11 platform, Bluebird Estates were still sourced from Japan. Although it was not the first Japanese car to be built in Britain (the Honda-based Triumph Acclaim predated it by five years), the Bluebird was instrumental in proving that a British factory could produce vehicles to the same quality standards as those built in Japan. The Bluebird proved so popular that in December 1987 Nissan announced the institution of a third shift, in order to bump production from 29,000 to circa 40,000 cars annually. Being built in the United Kingdom, it was possible to sell the Bluebird in markets like Spain and Italy without the quota limitations imposed on Japanese-made cars. In Italy, it was the only Nissan available in 1989, alongside the Spanish-made Patrol off-roader.

The later T72 models replaced the T12 during 1987, followed by a facelift around a year later. This is a point to note, as it is a common mistake to class all pre-facelift models as T12s. The facelift models had a more modern and European look, with round front and rear bumpers and the corporate slatted grille. These were eventually built entirely in England. In 1990, Nissan replaced the Bluebird with the Primera. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nissan Bluebirds were very commonly seen as taxis, their drivers racking up phenomenal mileage on just routine servicing and there is one still in daily use as a taxi in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain (October 2018). The bodyshell&#x27;s resistance to corrosion has become legendary - it is not uncommon to see Bluebirds as old as 1987 or 1988 vintage still on British roads with virtually no trace of rust at all. However, the Bluebirds&#x27; reliability and all-around robustness has ultimately led to its demise – as a banger racers&#x27; car of choice.

Almost all petrol T12/T72 Bluebirds came with 8-valve versions of Nissan&#x27;s CA Engine and either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. The diesel models used the normally aspirated LD20 engine. Performance was average for its class, the 1.6 struggling more with its lower torque characteristics that did not seem suited to the weight of the car. The turbo models used the CA18ET engine with giving a 0 - time of 8.6 seconds. This engine used a small turbocharger producing 0.60 bar of boost. This is the same engine used in the European Nissan Silvia S12. Power outputs for the naturally aspirated engines ranged from from the 1.6 through the 2.0-litre version, while the diesel offered .

As part of the 2016 celebrations marking Nissan’s 30th anniversary of production in the United Kingdom, a group of T12 and T72 owners traveled to Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK. The members of the Bluebird Car Club got to meet the employees who built their cars and view the firm&#x27;s modern manufacturing operations first-hand.


==U12 series (1989–1992)==

In the 1990 model year the American version of the Stanza was replaced by a basic version of the Nissan Bluebird (U12), wearing Stanza badges. In Japan, the Stanza was replaced by the Nissan Cefiro while the Auster was replaced by the Nissan Primera for the 1990 model year.

The JDM Bluebird has the rear license plate higher between the tail lights, whereas the Stanza&#x27;s is mounted on the bumper.

The fourth generation Stanza was offered in two trim levels: &quot;XE&quot; and &quot;GXE&quot;. The sporty SE model was added for 1992.

The 4th Gen Stanza used the 2.4 L inline-4 Nissan KA24E engine, an upgrade from previous generations in displacement (from 1974 cc to 2398 cc), power (from to ), and torque (from to ). The KA engine was not used on Japanese-spec Bluebirds.

The fourth generation Stanza has EPA estimated fuel economy of city and highway for the 4-speed automatic transmission. For the 5-speed manual transmission the Stanza has EPA estimated fuel economy of city and highway.

The Stanza was discontinued after the 1992 model year and replaced by the American-built Altima, also Bluebird-based. The last American Stanza rolled off the assembly line on 27 March 1992, though its name would live on in the first generation Altima, technically known as the &quot;Nissan Stanza Altima&quot;.

<doc id="695757" wikidata="Q1931037" url="?curid=695757" title="Crosswind">
<text>A crosswind is any wind that has a perpendicular component to the line or direction of travel. This affects the aerodynamics of many forms of transport. Moving non-parallel to the wind direction creates a crosswind component on the object and thus increasing the apparent wind on the object; such use of cross wind travel is used to advantage by sailing craft, kiteboarding craft, power kiting, etc. On the other side, crosswind moves the path of vehicles sideways and can be a hazard.

== Definition ==
When winds are not parallel to or directly with/against the line of travel, the wind is said to have a crosswind &quot;component&quot;; that is, the force can be separated into two vector components: 
* the headwind or tailwind component in the direction of motion,
* the crosswind component perpendicular to the former.

A vehicle behaves as though it is directly experiencing a lateral effect of the magnitude of the crosswind component only. The crosswind component is computed by multiplying the wind speed by the sine of the angle between the wind and the direction of travel while the headwind component is computed in the same manner, using cosine instead of sine. For example, a 10 knot wind coming at 45 degrees from either side will have a crosswind component of 10 knots × sin(45°) and a head/tailwind component of 10 knots × cos(45°), both equals to 7.07 knots.

To determine the crosswind component in aviation, aviators frequently refer to a nomograph chart on which the wind speed and angle are plotted, and the crosswind component is read from a reference line. Direction of travel relative to the wind may be left or right, up or down, or oblique.

== Impact ==
In aviation, a crosswind is the component of wind that is blowing across the runway, making landings and take-offs more difficult than if the wind were blowing straight down the runway. If a crosswind is strong enough, it can damage an aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage upon landing. Crosswinds, sometimes abbreviated as X/WIND, are reported in knots, abbreviated kt, and often use the plural form in expressions such as &quot;with 40kt crosswinds&quot;. Smaller aircraft are often not limited by their ability to land in a crosswind, but may see their ability to taxi safely reduced.

Crosswinds can also cause difficulty with ground vehicles traveling on wet or slippery roads (snow, ice, standing water, etc.), especially when gusting conditions affect vehicles that have a large side area such as vans, SUVs, and tractor-trailers. This can be dangerous for motorists because of the possible lift force created, causing the vehicle to lose traction or change direction of travel. The safest way for motorists to deal with crosswinds is by reducing their speed to reduce the effect of the lift force and to steer into the direction of the crosswind.

Cyclists are also significantly affected by crosswinds. Saving energy by avoiding riding in wind is a major part of the tactics of road bicycle racing, and this particularly applies in crosswinds. In crosswinds, groups of cyclists form &#x27;echelons&#x27;, rotating from the windward and leeward side. Riders who fail to form part of an echelon will have to work much harder, and can be dropped by the group that they are with. Crosswinds are common on races near the coast, and are often a feature of the Belgian classic one-day races, or flat stages of the Tour de France.

<doc id="695762" wikidata="Q3274515" url="?curid=695762" title="Nissan 240SX">
<text>The Nissan 240SX is a sports compact car that was introduced to the North American market by Nissan in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It replaced the outgoing 200SX (S12) model. Most of the 240SXs were equipped with the 2.4-liter inline-four engine (KA24E from 1989 to 1990 and KA24DE from 1990 to 1998). The KA24E had a single overhead cam and the KA24DE had dual overhead cams. Two distinct generations of the 240SX, the S13 (1989–1994) the S14 (1994-1998) were produced, based on the Nissan S platform.

The 240SX is closely related to other S platform based vehicles, such as the Japanese-market [[Nissan Silvia|Silvia]] and [[Nissan 180SX|180SX]], and the European-market [[Nissan Silvia|200SX]]. Although their names are similar, the 240SX is unrelated to the 240Z or the 280ZX.

The 240SX is known for its popularity within drifting and tuner culture. However, due to the popularity of the S-chassis in drifting and related competitions, prices for vehicles and parts have greatly increased due to higher demand. This problem is sometimes known as &quot;drift tax&quot;.


== First generation (S13; 1989–1994)==
The first generation of the 240SX can be divided into two distinct versions: the hatchback, which was offered in base, SE, and LE trims, and the coupé, which was offered in base, XE, LE and SE trims. Both styles shared the same front bodywork as the Japanese-market Nissan 180SX, featuring the sloping front with pop-up headlights. This front bodywork distinguishes the coupé model from its Japanese-market counterpart, the Silvia, which featured fixed headlights. Both styles in all markets share the same chassis, and with few exceptions, most components and features are identical.

1989 and 1990 models are powered by a naturally aspirated , SOHC KA24E four-cylinder engine with three valves per cylinder (instead of the turbocharged and intercooled 1.8-liter DOHC CA18DET offered in Japan and Europe in the 180SX and Silvia). When tested by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, the SOHC 240SX achieved a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 8.6 seconds and a quarter mile time of 16.4 seconds at . Four-wheel disc brakes were standard, with anti-lock brakes available as an option on the SE. Both models were offered with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Coupes offered a Heads-up display (HUD) with a digital speedometer as part of the optional Power Convenience Group.

The 240SX received some updates in 1991. The matte silver, teardrop wheels were replaced by polished aluminium 7-spoke wheels that had better brake cooling properties but more drag. The nose was smoothed out by getting rid of the non-functional slots and gave back the aerodynamic efficiencies lost by the wheels. This gave the car an overhaul that included a minor update of the exterior and a new cylinder head. A new &quot;LE&quot; hatchback trim package was added that included leather interior. The SOHC KA24E was replaced by the DOHC KA24DE, now with 4 valves per cylinder, rated at at 5,600 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm. When tested by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, the DOHC 240SX achieved a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.9 seconds and a quarter mile time of 16.2 seconds at . An optional sports package including ABS, a limited-slip differential, and Nissan&#x27;s HICAS four-wheel steering was now available on hatchback models.
The S13 was praised by journalists for sharp steering and handling (thanks to front MacPherson struts and a rear multilink suspension) and relatively light weight, but was regarded in the automotive press as being underpowered. The engine, while durable and relatively torquey, was a heavy iron-block truck unit that produced meager power for its relatively large size. It was only modestly improved by the change to the DOHC version in 1991. Furthermore, despite the modest power output, relatively low weight, and good aerodynamics, gas mileage was mediocre. These engines are the primary difference between the North American 240SX and the international-market Silvia/180SX/200SX. The KA24DE did not come turbocharged while the CA18DET and SR20DET did. Other differences include a standard limited-slip differential on overseas and Canadian models, available digital climate control in Japan, and manual seat belts standard in Japan and Canada vs. automatic restraint seatbelts in the U.S.

== Second generation (S14; 1994–1998)==

The second generation 240SX was released in the spring of 1994 as a 1995 model. The hatchback and convertible body styles were eliminated, leaving only the coupe. The wheelbase of the
car grew and the track width was also increased, while the overall length of the vehicle was slightly shorter than the previous generation. The curb weight of the vehicle increased by about relative to the 1994 model. Dual air bags were added and the automatic seatbelts were replaced with common manual type. The pop-up headlights were replaced with fixed headlamps. The cupholders were also removed in this generation of the Nissan 240SX. Though the general layout remained the same, almost all parts were redesigned to the extent that very few parts are interchangeable. The chassis was changed slightly to increase stiffness (Nissan claimed 50% torsional, 100% bending rigidity increase) and utilized higher rear strut mounts. The fuel tank, previously located at the rear end under the trunk floor, now sits in front of the rear suspension and behind the rear seats. The second generation carries over the naturally aspirated DOHC KA24DE engine from the first generation, producing the same at 5,600 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm, but features internal revisions for improved throttle response and reduced shake and vibration. When tested by &quot;MotorWeek&quot;, the 240SX achieved a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 7.3 seconds and a quarter mile time of 15.5 seconds at . Upon its launch, Nissan said the primary target demographic for the new 240SX was single women with no children, stating that women already made up 61% of 240SX buyers, and that they hoped to increase that number.
The base model had 4-lug, 15-inch wheels, a softer suspension, and no rear sway bar. The base model had several options and features available to be fitted to the car such as leather seats, ABS, and a viscous limited-slip differential. SE and LE models came equipped with 5-lug, 16-inch alloy wheels, a stiffer suspension than the base model, and a rear sway bar. The LE was basically an upgraded SE model, but with more standard equipment such as leather seats, keyless entry, an anti-theft system, and a CD player. Anti-lock brakes and a viscous limited-slip differential could be had as an optional package to both base and SE/LE models.
In 1996, the 1997 model year 240SX received minor updates. The different looks of the S-Chassis are referred to as before change &quot;Zenki&quot; and after change &quot;Kouki&quot;. Changes were mostly aesthetic, including new projector headlights, front bumper, hood, fenders, and revised taillights and center panel. Side skirts became standard on the SE and LE trim level. 1998 marked the end of production for the Nissan 240SX, with no further variations released in North America.

This generation of the 240SX suffered in sales due to competition from other car manufacturers and consumers at the time choosing more practical vehicles, such as SUVs. In this generation, every 240SX was built in Kyūshū, Japan. The last 240SX rolled off the assembly line on July 23, 1998.

==Motorsport==
The IMSA GTU Nissan 240SX was originally piloted by vintage Datsun and Nissan racer Bob Leitzinger through the late 1980s and 1990s. It is currently owned and raced by Philip Mendelovitz. The tube chassis was custom built for IMSA GTU class racing. From Speedhunters: &quot;The roofline and taillight lenses are some of the only parts this thing shares with a normal S13. The engine is Nissan&#x27;s VG30 V6 typically found in the Nissan Z and D21 truck. It is naturally aspirated and dry sumped, and a United States engine builder who managed to help the single overhead cam V6 to make about 340 horsepower. Chassis code LR-001, seen right, was entered in nearly 80 different events during its career, and it helped Nissan earn four-straight manufacturers championship wins between 1991 and 1994. The engine tuning system utilizes a Sony Walkman to write engine performance metrics to tape. These tapes are fed to a special computer to change fueling, timing, and other tuning parameters.

==Drifting==
The Nissan 240SX is a popular platform within the drifting community, both in amateur competition as well as in professional series such as Formula D. Although never marketed to the drifting community during its production, its Japanese counterparts, the Nissan 180SX and Nissan Silvia (S13), were adopted in Japan during the foundational years of drifting. They were chosen for their balanced weight distribution of 55/45 front to rear, and their overall lightweight RWD layout.

<text>The green peafowl (Pavo muticus) or Indonesian peafowl is a peafowl species native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia and Indochina. It is the national bird of Myanmar. Formerly common throughout Southeast Asia, only a few isolated populations survive in Cambodia and adjacent areas of Vietnam. It has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2009, primarily due to widespread deforestation, agriculture and loss of suitable habitat, severely fragmenting populations and contributing to an overall decline in numbers. The green peafowl is in demand for private and home aviculture and threatened by the pet trade, feather collectors and hunters for meat and targeted.

==Description==

The green peafowl is a large bird in terms of overall size. The male is in total length, including its train, which measures ; the adult female is around half the total length of the breeding male at in length. It has a relatively large wingspan that averages around and can reach in big males. The green peafowl is capable of sustained (albeit energy-intensive) flight and is often observed on the wing.

Green peafowl males vocalize at their roost sites at dawn and dusk with a loud often repeated &quot;ki-wao&quot;. The female vocalizes with an equally loud &quot;AOw-aa&quot; call, with an emphasis on the first syllable. The males may also make a similar sound to the females.
The green peafowl has long upper-tail covert feathers. In the male, this extends up to and is adorned with eyespots; in the female, the coverts are green and much shorter, just covering the tail. Outside of the breeding season, however, the male&#x27;s tail coverts (or train) is moulted; distinguishing the sexes during this period can be difficult unless they are observed quite up close. The neck and breast feathers (of both sexes) are highly iridescent green and resemble Chinese dragon scales. In the male, the scapular, median, and greater wing coverts are blue; the lesser coverts are green and form a triangle of scaly shoulder feathers (when the wing is closed). The secondaries are black and, in some subspecies, the tertials are brown and/or barred with a faint pattern. The female has blue lesser coverts, and lacks the triangle at the wing-shoulder. Females also have neck scales fringed with copper, as well as more barring on the back, the primaries and alula. Both sexes have crest feathers, are long-legged, heavy-winged, and long-tailed in silhouette. The crest of the female has slightly wider plumes, while those of the male are thinner but taller. The facial skin is double-striped with a whitish-blue; beside the ear is a yellow-orange crescent. The dark triangle below the eye (towards the eyebrow) is bluish-green in the male, and brown in the female. Seen from a distance, they are generally dark-coloured birds with pale vermilion- or buff-coloured primaries, which are quite visible in their peculiar flight; this action has been described as a true &quot;flapping&quot; flight, lacking the gliding that one associates with many birds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The green peafowl was widely distributed in Southeast Asia in the past from southern China especially Yunnan, eastern and north-eastern India, southeastern Bangladesh, northern Myanmar, extending through Laos, and Thailand into Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, and the island of Java in Indonesia, but in Java they are only found in protected areas such as Ujung Kulon National Park and Baluran National Park. Records from northeastern India have been questioned and old records are possibly of feral birds. The ranges have reduced with habitat destruction and hunting.

Green peafowl are found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary forest, both tropical and subtropical, as well as evergreen and deciduous. They may also be found amongst bamboo, on grasslands, savannas, scrub, and farmland edge. In Vietnam, the preferred habitat was found to be dry, deciduous forest close to water and away from human disturbance. In Java they are only found in savanna. Proximity to water appears to be an important factor.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first classified as &quot;Pavo muticus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus, although it was previously described in Europe by Ulisse Aldrovandi as &quot;Pavo Iaponensis&quot; based on a Japanese painting given to the pope by the emperor of Japan. These birds were depicted as having no spurs; Linnaeus followed Aldrovandi&#x27;s description. The Japanese had imported green peafowl from Southeast Asia for hundreds of years, and the birds were frequently depicted in Japanese paintings. As a result, the type locality described by Linnaeus was &quot;Habitat in Japonia&quot;, though the species is not native to Japan (they were kept by the emperor and no longer occur). François Levaillant was one of the first Western ornithologists to see a live bird, imported from Macau to an animal collection in Cape of Good Hope. From an Indian painting, George Shaw described a peafowl native to India with a &quot;blue head&quot; and an &quot;upright lanceolate crest&quot;, which he named &quot;Pavo spicifer&quot;, the spike-crested peacock. A third form of green peafowl was described in 1949 by Jean Delacour, as &quot;P. imperator&quot;, found in Indochina. From the advice of a bird dealer in Hong Kong, Delacour concluded there were three races of green peafowl, lumping &quot;P. spicifer&quot; into the species, as well. Today, most authorities recognise these three:
Delacour dismissed several aberrant specimens to be individual variations (including the type specimens for &quot;imperator&quot; originating from the Bolaven Plateau in Laos), and stated more subspecies may be recognised with further studies. However, few studies have been conducted to substantiate Delacour&#x27;s classification, even though it is accepted by nearly all authorities. Some authors have suggested that the population found in Yunnan, which are traditionally classified as &quot;imperator&quot;, may be another race. Using the cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA gene, Ouyang et al. estimated the divergence period between green and Indian peafowl to be 3 million years. In the same study, they also noted there appeared to be two different forms of green peafowl in Yunnan which should be classified as distinct subspecies. A 2005 article from &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper of Malaysia stated that research indicated the Malaysian form to be identical to the Javanese form, but the study was not published and some authors dispute the result. Due to the large range of &quot;imperator&quot; in Indochina, other subspecies within its range have also been proposed, notably &quot;annamensis&quot; of Southeast Asia and &quot;yunnanensis&quot; of Yunnan.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The green peafowl is a forest bird which nests on the ground laying an egg clutch with three to six eggs.

It has been widely stated that the green peafowl is polygynous, but males are solitary and do not display in leks. Instead the solitary males are highly territorial and form harems with no pair bonds. However, the theory that the male is polygynous also conflicts with observations in captivity; pairs left alone with no human interaction have been observed to be strongly monogamous. The close similarity between both sexes also suggests a different courtship display in contrast to that of the Indian peafowl. Thus, some authors have suggested that the harems seen in the field are juvenile birds and that males are not promiscuous.

They usually spend time on or near the ground in tall grasses and sedges. Family units roost in trees at a height of .

==Threats and conservation==
Due to hunting; especially poaching, and a reduction in extent and quality of habitat, the green peafowl is evaluated as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. The world population has declined rapidly and the species no longer occurs in many areas of its past distribution. The last strongholds for the species are in protected areas such as Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand, Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam and Baluran National Park, Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. The population in the wild was estimated to be about 5,000 to 10,000 individuals around 1995. In Cambodia, Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary was shown to hold a significant and increasing population of around 745 individuals in 2020.

Although there is no natural range overlap with the Indian peafowl, hybridisation is still a threat where the Indian peafowl is introduced as they produce fertile hybrids. In captivity hybrids are called &quot;Spalding&quot; peafowl and are used by breeders to create different breeds. Through backcrossing some hybrids become almost indistinguishable from pure green peafowl.

In 2005, it was reported that successful reintroductions were being made in Malaysia by the World Pheasant Association. Genetic research allegedly proved that the Javan and Malay peafowl are genetically identical, and the subspecies &quot;muticus&quot; was introduced based on scientific community consensus. However, the assumption that the Malaysian and Javanese &quot;muticus&quot; birds are the same subspecies remains controversial, so it is uncertain which subspecies was introduced.

==Cultural significance==
In Myanmar, the green peafowl was an ancient symbol of the country&#x27;s monarchs.
The green peafowl is often depicted in Japanese paintings from the Edo period, notably by Maruyama Ōkyo and Nagasawa Rosetsu.
&quot;The Peacock Room&quot;, a room installation painted between 1876 and 1877 by James McNeill Whistler now located in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., prominently features paintings of green peafowl.
It was also shown during British colonial times on the flag of the governor and the naval ensign, as well as on the flag of the State of Burma from 1943 to 1945 and on the currency of independent Burma as well.

<text>The Mitsubishi Diamante is an automobile that was manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors from 1990 to 2005.

The first series was a hardtop introduced to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1989. It went on sale in Japan exclusively in May 1990 and won that year&#x27;s Japan Car of the Year award. It was created by splicing an extra right down the middle of the Mitsubishi Galant, which itself had won the Japan Car of the Year award in 1987. The Diamante&#x27;s platform was also used for the sporty Mitsubishi 3000GT.

The name Diamante was derived from the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian word for &quot;diamond&quot; and was adopted also as homage to the Mitsubishi badge which is composed of three diamonds. In Japan, this vehicle was sold at a specific retail chain called &quot;Car Plaza&quot;.

==History==
From 1991, a more conventional Diamante-derived Mitsubishi Sigma sedan was also built in Japan for its domestic and European export markets. It became the basis of the second generation Magna independently built in Australia. Its Australian luxury derivate, sold as the Verada, became the Diamante for export markets including New Zealand and North America a year later. The Wagon version was also exported including to Japan.

There have been rumors that the Diamante was either not intended for a Japanese launch, or it might have been planned as a low-volume model. The reason for this argument is that until 1989, the width of vehicles impacted the taxation class. The Diamante, being wider than the breakpoint, would have suffered a large tax penalty against most of its rivals, which were designed to be just inside that vital limit. At the time, Mitsubishi&#x27;s international image was also considered less than ideal for the marketing of a luxury car — its most expensive offering at the time, the Debonair, was largely seen as a company car project for Mitsubishi conglomerate executives. The Diamante&#x27;s introduction was the result of the Honda/Acura Legend, which caught manufacturers by surprise when it appeared in 1986, inspiring the creation of the Lexus and Infiniti divisions, as well as various executive car class vehicles to be revised as a result. Mitsubishi needed to compete with the Legend and the Diamante was the result.

However, the tax situation changed in 1989, and the Diamante became the surprise hit of 1990. Amidst Japan&#x27;s bubble economy, many private car owners sought an executive car in a market that had very few new offerings that year.

== First generation (1990–1995) ==

The first generation Diamante was produced in three versions:
* &quot;Four-side window hardtop&quot;: a four-door hardtop with frameless windows that was solely built in Nagoya, Japan, and only sold in Japan and North America. It featured advanced electronic aids such as four-wheel steering (4WS).
* &quot;Six-side window sedan&quot;: a more conventional variant built and introduced in Japan five months after the Diamante. It was called the Sigma and differed by having a slightly taller roofline, a six-window glasshouse, window sashes, revised front fascia and rear styling. It was exported to Europe from Japan and formed the basis of the second generation Magna/Verada sedan, which was independently built in Adelaide, South Australia. Its luxury derivative, the Verada was intended for the domestic consumption and primary export to North America (but export to North America never happened) (hence the longer bumper bars to meet the latter&#x27;s more onerous crash standards).
* &quot;Wagon&quot;: this was the wagon version of the above-mentioned sedan, designed and manufactured exclusively by Mitsubishi Australia. It was introduced in late 1992 for the 1993 model year.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Diamante hardtop was built from 1990 until 1995 and was available in front wheel drive (FWD) and all wheel drive (AWD). Some models featured 4WS (see Mitsubishi AWC for details).

FWD versions featured an independent suspension design with MacPherson strut at the front and multi-link in the rear. This version was available with a range of engines listed below, some with five-speed manual in addition to four-speed automatic transmission.

AWD Diamantes come in three models: the 25V 4WD, 30R 4WD and the flagship 30R-SE 4WD. All have MacPherson strut front suspension with double wishbones at the rear. Both front and rear brake discs are ventilated. The AWD Diamante sits lower than a standard FWD Diamante and has a 70-liter fuel tank instead of the FWD&#x27;s 72-liter tank.

This range of vehicles was powered by three V6 engines (of 2.0-, 2.5- and 3.0-liter capacity) of the 6G7 family; AWD was available on most models. Perhaps contrary to its overseas image, Mitsubishi at the time fully emphasized the use of electronic gadgets in its cars and the Diamante is notable for a long list of such features. Each engine choice obligated buyers in Japan to pay more annual road tax and the level of standard and luxury equipment increased accordingly.

Chief among these was:
* The world&#x27;s first autonomous cruise control system labelled &quot;Preview Distance Control&quot;;
* An electronically controlled active trace and traction control system that Mitsubishi developed and was the first integration of these two systems in the world. Simply labelled &quot;TCL&quot; in 1990, the system evolved into Mitsubishi&#x27;s Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner, an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. In essence, when too much throttle was applied while negotiating a curve, engine output and braking would be automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through the curve is followed and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi&#x27;s newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called &quot;trace control&quot;) thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a proper modern stability control system, trace control was able to monitor steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds but without any yaw input. In addition, this TCL system also works together with Diamante&#x27;s electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi developed to improve total handling and performance.

The Diamante won the Car of the Year Japan award in 1990–1991 and its model range was as follows:

;20E
The 20E is the base model Diamante. It comes with a 2.0-liter 6G71 SOHC 12-valve V6 engine outputting at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. It is available as both a five-speed manual and four-speed automatic, with 14-inch steel wheels. Standard equipment includes power windows, speed sensitive power steering, power mirrors, climate control and a four-speaker AM/FM radio with cassette. Optional extras were a rear wiper and alloy wheels. It has the F11A frame number. In October 1992 this engine was replaced by the new 24-valve 6A12 engine, with the same overall displacement but a shorter stroke. Power increased to and the chassis number became F12A.

;25E

The 25E has the same features as the 20E but replaces the 20E&#x27;s 2.0-liter engine with a 2.5-liter unit. The 25E&#x27;s 2.5-liter &quot;6G73&quot; V6 engine outputs at 6000 rpm and at 4500 rpm. The 25E has a frame number of E-F13A.

;25V
The next model in the model range is the 25V. The 25V is almost the same as the 25E, although is identified with a different frame number reflecting the fact that four-wheel steering was equipped (E-F15A). It uses the same 2.5-liter &quot;6G73&quot; V6 engine, outputting at 6000 rpm and at 4500 rpm. It is available in four-speed automatic transmission and 15-inch alloy wheels. In addition to the 20E equipment, the 25V also features speed sensitive power steering, leather-wrapped steering wheel and ventilated rear brake discs for maximum braking performance. Optional was a rear wiper.

;25V-SE
The 25V-SE is the top of the range 2.5-liter Diamante variant. As with its lower variants the 2.5-liter &quot;6G73&quot; V6 engine is used. Like the 25V upon which it is based, it is only available as an automatic. In addition to the 25V equipment, the 25V-SE features anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction control system (TCS) and electric-powered seats. Optionals are the rear wiper and leather interior. It is identified by the same E-F15A frame number as the 25V. There was also a version of this without the four-wheel steering called the 25V-S, with chassis code F13A.

;30V
The 30V is the base 3.0-liter FWD Diamante base. It comes with a 3.0-liter &quot;6G72&quot; V6 outputting at 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. It is only available in automatic. The FWD Diamante Wagon comes with a 3.0-liter &quot;6G72&quot; V6 outputting at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm. On top of the 25V equipment, the 30V features cruise control, remote central locking, six-speaker AM/FM cassette player and TCS. Leather interior and rear wiper remain optional. The frame number of the 30V is E-F17A, F07W for the wagon (although it is sometimes referred to as &quot;K45&quot; as well).

;30R
The 30R is the middle of the 3.0-liter FWD Diamante range. It uses the 3.0-liter &quot;6G72&quot; V6 outputting a 6000 rpm and at 3000 rpm. As with all higher spec Diamantes it is available in automatic only. The 30R, which sold for more than the 30V has everything of the 30V except for TCS and ABS. The only addition is a front spoiler. The 30R is identified with the same E-F17A frame number.

;30R-SE
The 30R-SE is the top of the FWD Diamante range. It uses the same 3.0-liter V6 as the 30R/30V and again is automatic only. The 30R-SE has all the equipment fitted to the 30V but active suspension granting it a road height. Externally, it also features the front spoiler of the 30R. Its frame number is E-F17A.

;25V 4WD
The 25V 4WD is the entry level Diamante with AWD. It has a frame number of E-F25A.

The 25V comes with a 2.5-liter &quot;6G73&quot; V6 engine, outputting at 6000 rpm and at 4500 rpm. Standard equipment includes speed sensing power steering, power windows, power mirrors, cruise control, leather steering wheel, alloy wheels, remote central locking, climate control and a four speaker AM/FM radio with cassette player. Optional is full leather interior and a rear wiper.

;30R-SE 4WD
The 30R-SE 4WD is the flagship of the Diamante range. It has the frame number of E-F27A as it is the same basic vehicle as the 30R. The only difference between the 30R-SE and 30R is the addition of a CD player.

=== North America ===

The Diamante sedan was first sold in the United States in spring 1991 for model year 1992, replacing the Sigma. Mitsubishi Motors North America sourced their Diamante hardtop sedans from Japan and the wagons, introduced in late 1992 for model year 1993, from Australia. The Diamante was originally available in two trim levels, the base and LS, and only as FWD automatics. The base model used the &quot;6G72&quot; 3.0-liter V6 rated at , and shared with the Diamante wagon. The LS sedan got a dual-cam version of the 6G72, rated at . Standard equipment for ES included central locking, driver&#x27;s airbag, power windows and power mirrors. Optional was ABS, cruise control, alloys and sunroof. The LS added alloy wheels, cruise control and ABS to the standard equipment list. A manual sunroof and leather were optional. 

With the 1993 model year update, there were minor equipment changes, and the base Diamante gained the ES suffix. The station wagon also became available during 1993.

When the Diamante was updated in 1994, sedans received revised taillamps, and a four-spoke steering wheel with audio controls. All models now included a passenger side airbag and cruise control as standard. For the LS, the manual sunroof was deleted from the option list and replaced with a CD player, power sunroof and traction control. Anti-lock brakes were standard on the LS and optional on the ES and wagon.

For the 1995 model year, the ES sedan was relegated to fleet sales, leaving only the LS sedan and the station wagon available to the general public. For 1996, only the ES and LS sedan remained and were made available only to rental car companies.

=== Australia ===
The Australian-built first generation Diamante was manufactured in Adelaide, South Australia. It was marketed in its domestic market as the Verada, which was a more luxurious version of the more mainstream second generation Australian-made Magna, both based on the Japanese Sigma. This model was the only one also built as a wagon that, along with the sedan, was intended for both the Australian domestic and export markets.

===Europe===
In European markets, the Sigma was only available with the 3-liter, V6 engine. The 24-valve version produces , while the 12-valve V6 produces . In March 1993 the Australian-built Sigma Station Wagon this was the only option for the Sigma Station Wagon. The 12-valve engine in the sedan and in the Australian-built wagon, introduced in March 1993. All versions were available with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic (with different importers choosing whether or not to offer all iterations), but the manual options were discontinued in mid-1995. The station wagon had a simpler, more compact rear suspension to free up luggage space. However, the station wagon also had a lower maximum load than the sedan, at including passengers, which somewhat limited its utility.

== Second generation (1995–2005) ==


The second generation of the Diamante was introduced to the Japanese market in January 1995. The Sigma variant was eliminated and not renewed for a second generation, due to poor sales in Japan; after a strong start most Sigmas sold had become taxis and patrol cars.

The Diamante was marginally larger with improved headroom. It was powered by several engines: the base engine was a 2.5-liter MVV (lean burn) V6, followed by a number of 2.5 and 3.5-liter variants, the 2.5-liter engine sported 175 hp and the 3.5-liter engine boasted . The new Diamante range in Japan topped off with a 3.0-liter MIVEC V6 rated at at 6000 rpm and at 4500 rpm. In its latter years, the Diamante range was reduced to a single engine offering in Japan, first a 3.0-liter GDI V6 with (the first of its kind), and then a conventional 2.5-liter V6.

The Australian produced Verada came off the production line on 1 July 1996, and now formed the basis of all Diamantes sold outside Japan. Both the Verada (designated the KE series in Australia) and the Magna (TE series) on which it was based, won the 1996 Wheels magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award.

Sales on the US market commenced with the 1997 model year in late October 1996, where it occupied &quot;near luxury&quot; segment and competed on price with vehicles like the Lexus ES 300. The Diamante featuring export-only extra equipment such as keyless entry, but never featuring the eventual all wheel drive (AWD) drivetrain that became available for the Australian and New Zealand range (respectively badged Verada and Diamante). The North American Diamante also didn&#x27;t receive an automatic with a manual-shift mode until 2004, and even then it was available only in LS and VR-X models and had only four speeds. 

These Australian export models were mechanically different from the Japanese Diamante since the latter:
* had multi-link front and rear suspension (whereas the Australian version had more basic MacPherson front struts);
* only featured leather trim (Verada Ei featured cloth trim);
* had a foot-operated parking brake (whereas the Australian production featured a conventional lever design)
* had a pressed steel front cross-member.

In addition, with the Japanese Diamante, Mitsubishi introduced more technological innovations including:
* a more advanced Traction control system (which was later introduced in Australia and therefore all export models);
* satellite navigation system with a display featuring prominently on the center console;
* Head-Up Display;
* a distance/lane-keeping system that tracked lanes and cars ahead using a set of laser and camera (being technology first adopted by the 1992 Debonair);
* the world&#x27;s first five-speed automatic transmission in a transverse-engined drivetrain, complete with &quot;INVECS-II&quot; software logic and Tiptronic-functionality (the latter also subsequently introduced on Australian models from the KJ-series).

Australia was also the source of all Diamante wagons, for its domestic market and export markets including Japan, where their sales commenced in October 1997.

The exterior was refreshed for 2002 at which time, the Diamante won New Zealand&#x27;s Car of the Year award. A radical restyle followed with the presentation at the 2003 New York International Auto Show of a new Diamante adopting the then new corporate look. Mitsubishi ceased to export the Diamante to North America after 2004 due to a decline in sales and unfavourable exchange rates. The U.S. market Galant grew in size, and the Diamante was replaced by the upper-end &quot;GTS&quot; trim of the Galant.

In Canada, the Diamante was only sold from December 2003 for the 2004 model year only. The Canadian version is based on the US version, but with some subtle changes such as daytime running headlamps, heated exterior mirrors, English/French labelling, and metric gauges/trip computer.

In Japan, the Diamante did not receive the extensive 2002 and 2004 restylings of the US and Australian/New Zealand models. It continued in its original narrow-body 1995 form until 2005.

On 15 June 2005, Mitsubishi announced it would halt production on larger sedans within Japan by December of that year, affecting both Diamante and Galant models. The production of the Magna/Verada combo by Mitsubishi Motors Australia continued unaffected.
=== VR-X ===
Introduced in 2002, the VR-X was a sporty variant of the Australian-made Diamante exported to North America. It was continued with the 2004 restyling.

The 2002 model&#x27;s exterior was based on the top-of-the-range Australian KJ-series Verada sedan, whereas its mechanicals and fittings were derived from a combination of other Australian-made models:
* Stiffer sports suspension from the limited edition Verada GTV (which, in turn, inherited it from the Magna Sports/VR-X sedans);
* 16-inch sports alloy wheels from the Magna Sports;
* Leather trim and electric seats from the Verada Xi;
* White &quot;VR-X&quot;-marked instrument fascia from the Magna VR-X (as opposed to the standard Diamante and Verada electro instruments);
* Silver centre console trim and 2-tone leather steering wheel from the Magna VR-X Limited Edition (losing the other Diamante&#x27;s radio remote control);
* Bodykit featuring front wheel arch extensions and wheelbase skirts from the Magna VR-X, plus unique rear wheel arch extensions and bootlid spoiler.

Unique to the American VR-X was a 270-watt, eight-speaker sound system and its engine was a 3.5-liter V6 engine that developed compared to the standard Diamante&#x27;s 3.5-liter V6 engine&#x27;s . This VR-X did not, therefore, feature the Australian &quot;high output&quot; version fitted to the Magna Sports/VR-X based Verada GTV, whose engines produced and were mated to an advanced five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (or also a five-speed manual in the case of the said Magna models).

The 2004 model continued the above mix of features but this time became more directly based on the TL-series Magna. Specifically, unlike the standard Diamante models that were Verada on the outside, the 2004 model was based on the Magna VR-X (for example, the rear light cluster were identical between these two). This Diamante VR-X inherited the 16-inch alloy wheels from the Australian Magna VR-X AWD (notably, the front-wheel drive Magna instead had 17-inch alloy wheels and the Magna Sports was no longer the wheel donor car because it was discontinued by this time). Electric seats and leather trim remained Verada-derived fittings. The steering wheel remained the 2-tone leather unit of the 2001 TJ series Magna VR-X Limited Edition (that became an optional accessory available across the Australian range).

<doc id="695780" wikidata="Q220910" url="?curid=695780" title="Casino (1995 film)">
<text>Casino is a 1995 epic crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese, adapted by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi from the latter&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;.&quot; It stars Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Frank Vincent and James Woods. The film was the eighth collaboration between director Scorsese and De Niro.

&quot;Casino&quot; follows Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (De Niro), a Jewish American gambling expert handicapper who is asked by the Chicago Outfit to oversee the day-to-day casino and hotel operations at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Other significant characters include Nicky Santoro (Pesci), a &quot;made man&quot; and friend of Sam, and Ginger McKenna (Stone), a streetwise chip hustler whom Sam marries and has a daughter with. The film details Sam&#x27;s operation of the casino, the difficulties he confronts in his job, the Mafia&#x27;s involvement with the casino, and the gradual breakdown of his relationships and standing, as Las Vegas changes over the years.

The primary characters are based on real people: Sam is inspired by the life of Frank Rosenthal, also known as &quot;Lefty&quot;, who ran the Stardust, Fremont, Marina, and Hacienda casinos in Las Vegas for the Chicago Outfit from 1968 until 1981. Nicky and Ginger are based on mob enforcer Anthony Spilotro and former dancer and socialite Geri McGee, respectively.

&quot;Casino&quot; was released on November 22, 1995, by Universal Pictures, to a mostly positive critical reception, and was a worldwide box office success. Stone&#x27;s performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Plot==

In 1973, sports handicapper and Mafia associate Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein is sent by the Chicago Outfit to Las Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino, with frontman Philip Green. Sam soon doubles the casino&#x27;s profits, with the extra unaccounted-for cash skimmed directly from the casino count room and delivered to the Midwest Mafia bosses. Chicago boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam&#x27;s childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicky Santoro to protect Sam, the cash skim, and the casino. Nicky recruits his younger brother Dominick and childhood friend Frankie Marino to gather an experienced crew specializing in shakedowns and jewelry burglaries. Nicky&#x27;s criminal activities in Las Vegas start drawing too much media and police attention, and he is eventually placed in the Black Book, banning him from every casino in Nevada. Sam meets and falls in love with a beautiful con artist, showgirl, and former prostitute Ginger McKenna. They have a daughter, Amy, and marry. Sam entrusts Ginger with $2 million in cash and $1 million in jewelry. Still, their marriage is soon thrown into turmoil due to Ginger&#x27;s relationship with her longtime boyfriend, hustler and pimp Lester Diamond. Sam has Nicky&#x27;s crew beat Lester when they catch him accepting $25,000 of Sam&#x27;s money from her.

In 1976, Sam fires slot manager Don Ward for incompetence. Ward is brother-in-law to Clark County Commission chairman Pat Webb, who is unable to convince Sam to re-hire Ward. Webb arranges for Sam&#x27;s gaming license to be denied, jeopardizing Sam&#x27;s position. Sam starts hosting a local television talk show from inside the casino, irritating both Nicky and the bosses back home for bringing more unneeded attention. Sam blames Nicky&#x27;s recklessness for ongoing police and state government pressure, and Sam&#x27;s attempts to get Nicky to leave Las Vegas only further strain their friendship.

When the Midwest bosses discover that people on the inside are stealing from their skim, they install incompetent Kansas City underboss Artie Piscano to oversee the operation. Disobeying orders, Piscano keeps detailed written records of the operation. Additionally, an FBI bug placed in Piscano&#x27;s grocery store catches him talking in detail about the skim, prompting a full investigation into the Tangiers Casino.

In 1980, Ginger kidnaps little Amy, planning to flee to Europe with her and Lester. Sam convinces Ginger to return with Amy, then overhears her planning on the phone to kill him. Enraged, Sam kicks her out of their home but relents and forgives her. Ginger confides in Nicky about the situation, and the two start an affair. Sam soon discovers their affair, as do private investigators. Nicky ends his affair with Ginger once she asks him to kill Sam and threatens to go to the FBI. Ginger leaves Sam and takes all of her money and jewelry.

In 1982, the FBI discovers Piscano&#x27;s records, closes the Tangiers, and Green agrees to cooperate. The FBI approaches Sam for help by showing him photos of Nicky and Ginger together, but he turns them down. The Chicago bosses are arrested, get ready for trial, and arrange the murders of anyone who might testify against them. In 1983, Ginger, whose personal fortune was squandered by lowlife associates, dies of a hot dose in Los Angeles. That same year, Sam narrowly survives a car bomb, suspecting Nicky to be the culprit. Sam states that the bosses did not authorize the bombing because they had &quot;other ideas&quot; for him.

In 1986, the bosses, finally fed up with Nicky&#x27;s recklessness and attempt on Sam&#x27;s life, order Frankie and his crew to kill Nicky and Dominick. Invited to attend a meetup in a remote Illinois cornfield, they are brutally beaten with baseball bats upon arriving, stripped of their clothes, and buried alive in a shallow grave. With the Mafia now out of the casino industry, nearly all the old casinos are demolished, and new casinos are built with money from junk bonds. Sam laments the new impersonal, corporate-run resorts of Las Vegas. Because of his status as a reliable and high earner for the outfit, Sam is allowed to live, moving to San Diego and returning to sports handicapping; &quot;right back where I started,&quot; as Sam puts it before asking, &quot;Why mess up a good thing? And that&#x27;s that.&quot;

=== Development ===

&quot;Casino&quot; is based on New York crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi&#x27;s book &quot;Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas&quot;. The research for &quot;Casino&quot; began when Pileggi read a 1980 report from the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; about a domestic argument between Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, a casino figure, and his wife Geri McGee, a former topless dancer. This gave him an idea to focus on a new book about the true story of mob infringement in Las Vegas during the 1970s, when filming of &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (whose screenplay he co-wrote with Scorsese) was coming to an end. The fictional Tangiers resort reflected the story of the Stardust Resort and Casino, which had been bought by Argent Corporation in 1974 using loans from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. Argent was owned by Allen Glick, but the casino was believed to be controlled by various organized crime families from the Midwest. Over the next six years, Argent Corporation siphoned off between $7 and $15 million using rigged scales. This skimming operation, when uncovered by the FBI, was the largest ever exposed. A number of organized crime figures were convicted as a result of the skimming.

Nicholas Pileggi contacted Martin Scorsese about taking the lead of the project, which became known as &quot;Casino.&quot; Scorsese expressed interest, calling this an &quot;idea of success, no limits.&quot; Pileggi was keen to release the book and then concentrate on a film adaptation, but Scorsese encouraged him to &quot;reverse the order.&quot;

Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the script for five months, towards the end of 1994. Real-life characters were reshaped, such as Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, Geri McGee, Anthony Spilotro, Spilotro&#x27;s brother Michael, Spilotro&#x27;s right-hand man Frank Cullotta, and mob boss Joseph Aiuppa. Some characters were combined, and parts of the story were set in Kansas City instead of Chicago. A problem emerged when they were forced to refer to Chicago as &quot;back home&quot; and use the words &quot;adapted from a true story&quot; instead of &quot;based on a true story.&quot; Real life mobster turned witness Frank Cullotta inspired the character Frank Marino (played by Frank Vincent), served as a technical advisor for the film, and also played an on-screen role as a hitman.

They also decided to simplify the script, so that the character of Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein worked only at the Tangiers Casino, in order to show a glimpse of the trials involved in operating a Mafia-run casino hotel without overwhelming the audience. According to Scorsese, the initial opening sequence was to feature the main character, Sam Rothstein, fighting with his estranged wife Ginger on the lawn of their house. The scene was too detailed, so they changed the sequence to show the explosion of Sam&#x27;s car and him flying into the air before hovering over the flames in slow motion—like a soul about to go straight down to hell.

=== Principal photography ===
Filming took place at night in the Riviera casino in Las Vegas, with the nearby defunct Landmark Hotel as the entrance, to replicate the fictional Tangiers. According to Barbara De Fina, the film&#x27;s producer, there was no reason to construct a set if they could simply film around an actual casino. The opening scene, with Sam&#x27;s car exploding, was shot three times; the third take was used for the film. Saul Bass designed the title sequence, which was his last work. The total cost for the titles was $11,316, not including the fees for the Basses. Bass justified the cost to De Fina by noting that creating a continuous explosion from a second shot of an explosion demanded a lot of experimentation, as did getting the flight path of the body exactly right. When first submitted to the MPAA, the film received an NC-17 rating due to its depictions of violence. Several edits were made in order to reduce the rating to R.

The film was shot in the common-top Super 35 format as it allowed the picture to be reformatted for television broadcast. Scorsese said, &quot;I wish I could just shoot straight anamorphic, but the lenses we had in this situation were actually much more diversified. To a certain extent, shooting a film this way can make certain technical aspects more difficult, but to me, anything is better than panning and scanning on TV. We can re-frame just about every shot we did on this picture for video.&quot; Cinematographer Robert Richardson, on the other hand, was not impressed with the quality of the release prints, and did not touch the format again until &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;, at which point the digital intermediate process was available.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
During its five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, &quot;Casino&quot; opened in fifth place at the box office, grossing $14.5 million. The film grossed $43 million domestically and $73 million internationally, for a total of $116 million worldwide, against a $40–50 million production budget.

=== Critical response ===

Upon its release, &quot;Casino&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, although their praise was more muted than it had been for the thematically similar &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, released only five years earlier, with some reviewers criticizing Scorsese for retreading familiar territory. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Impressive ambition and bravura performances from an outstanding cast help &quot;Casino&quot; pay off in spite of a familiar narrative that may strike some viewers as a safe bet for director Martin Scorsese.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four complete stars, stating that &quot;Martin Scorsese&#x27;s fascinating new film &quot;Casino&quot; knows a lot about the Mafia&#x27;s relationship with Las Vegas. Like &quot;The Godfather&quot; it makes us feel like eavesdroppers in a secret place.&quot; He added, &quot;Unlike his other Mafia movies (&quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Goodfellas&quot;), Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Casino&quot; is as concerned with history as with plot and character.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; analyzed the film&#x27;s journalistic approach resulted with &quot;no conveniently sharp focus, a plot built like a centipede and characters with lives too messy to form conventional dramatic arcs.&quot; Regardless, she praised Sharon Stone, writing she &quot;will be nobody&#x27;s idea of Hollywood fluff after this spectacular, emblematic performance.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; felt the film &quot;possesses a stylistic boldness and verisimilitude that is virtually matchless&quot;. He praised De Niro&#x27;s performance as &quot;outstanding&quot; and felt Stone was &quot;simply a revelation here&quot;. However, he noted Pesci &quot;holds up his end of the picture perfectly well, but Nicky is basically the same character he won an Oscar for in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; but with a shade less of an edge.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote the film &quot;is not the equal of &quot;Mean Streets&quot; or &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, the more instinctive pieces in the crime trilogy that the flawed &quot;Casino&quot; completes (Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Godfather Part III&quot; fell off far more precipitously). It is, however, just as unmistakably the work of a virtuoso — bold, brutally funny and ferociously alive.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted the film is a return to Scorsese&#x27;s earlier gangster films, but felt he made &quot;too few emotional connections to persuade us to see things the way he does. So instead of being operatic and cathartic, this film ends up exhausting and claustrophobic.&quot; He praised the principal actors, most particularly highlighting Stone for displaying &quot;star quality and a feral intensity that is the equal of what the boys are putting down.&quot; Philip Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine praised the film while highlighting its similarities to &quot;Goodfellas.&quot; He gave the film five stars commenting &quot;It may not be Scorsese&#x27;s greatest work, but this guy feeling a little off-colour is still far, far better than most people on fighting-fit form. It only gets more impressive as time goes on.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing &quot;Casino&quot; is a &quot;sometime-dazzling, often-disappointing film from the great Martin Scorsese, who too often seems like he&#x27;s replaying his greatest hits with this picture, and not to the best effect ... DeNiro&#x27;s relationship with Cathy Moriarty in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was better and the flash-temper role by Pesci is a carbon copy of his work in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. &quot;Casino&quot; is hardly a bad film, but it breaks no new ground for Scorsese.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the film is &quot;not great&quot; and that clearly &quot;Scorsese and Pileggi are trying to disinter the success of &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, their last collaboration. But they only come up with &quot;Raging B.S.&quot;&quot;

The film&#x27;s critical profile has increased in years after its release, with critics Tom Charity and Natasha Vargas-Cooper expressing that they retrospectively feel &quot;Casino&quot; is a more accomplished and artistically mature work than the thematically similar &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;

<text>The Atlanta Knights were a minor league professional ice hockey team in the International Hockey League from 1992 to 1996. The Knights were based in Atlanta, and played at the Omni Coliseum. In 1994 the Knights won the Turner Cup which was the IHL championship. The team became the Quebec Rafales in 1996.

==History==
The Atlanta Knights was an IHL expansion team in 1992 as the top farm team of the NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning. They won the Turner Cup in the 1993–94 season. The Knights featured the first professional black head coach in John Paris Jr. The Knights were also one of the first professional teams to play a female goalie, Manon Rhéaume, in a regular-season game.

===Record in Atlanta===
====1992–93: Knightmare on Peachtree Street====

Led by team captain &amp; IHL legend Jock Callander and a 40-goal explosion from right winger Keith Osborne (each in their only season with the club), head coach Gene Ubriaco&#x27;s Knights would prove to be among the league&#x27;s most formidable sides, amassing franchise single-season records in wins (52), points (111) &amp; goals scored (333) en route to claiming the Atlantic Division championship.

The initial Knights roster featured many players that would go on to cement themselves into the folklore of the club, among them centers Brent Gretzky &amp; Colin Miller; wingers Christian Campeau, Stan Drulia and Jason Ruff; defencemen Jeff Buchanan, Eric Dubois, Chris LiPuma and Shawn Rivers; and goalkeepers Jean-Claude Bergeron and Mike Greenlay.

The inaugural Knights campaign also featured the North American professional hockey debuts of both Manon Rhéaume (2 games, 0–1–0, 6.36 GAA) and the 1992 NHL Entry Draft&#x27;s #1 overall pick, Roman Hamrlik (2 games, one goal, one assist, two points, 2 penalty minutes), a future three-time NHL All-Star.

====1993–94: The Knightmare Continues...and Comes True – Turner Cup Champions====

In 1993–94, the Knights became the first Atlanta-based sports franchise since the 1968 Atlanta Chiefs of the North American Soccer League to win a professional championship, capturing the Turner Cup in a best-of-seven Finals victory over the Fort Wayne Komets, four games to two.

The season-long excellence of goalkeepers J.C. Bergeron (27–11–7, 3.07) and Mike Greenlay (16–10–4, 3.58) resulted in the duo being awarded the James Norris Memorial Trophy (IHL). This masterful netminding combined with outstanding play from off-season acquisitions Steve Larouche and Jeff Madill as well as the blueline brilliance of Jeff Buchanan, Eric Charron, Cory Cross &amp; Eric Dubois contributed greatly to the Knights&#x27; second-consecutive division championship, this time the Midwest.

The 1993–94 season also saw Knights&#x27; legend Stan Drulia establish single-season club records for goals (54), assists (60), and points (114). The captain&#x27;s extraordinary play carried over into the post season, culminating in his being awarded the Norman R. &quot;Bud&quot; Poile Trophy (IHL) as MVP of the Turner Cup Playoffs with a 13-goal, 25 point performance over the tournament&#x27;s 14-game span.

4-0 series sweeps in each of the Turner Cup Playoff&#x27;s first two rounds (vs. the Milwaukee Admirals and San Diego Gulls (1990–95) respectively) earned the Knights their first Finals appearance. Greenlay&#x27;s brilliant play continued throughout the tournament with the netminder posting an eye-popping 11–1 record, a microscopic 2.32 GAA &amp; an outstanding .910 save percentage in 13 playoff appearances.

====1994–95: The Knightmare Continues====

====1995–96: Waking From the Knightmare – Relocation====

For the 1996–97 season, the Knights relocated due to the Omni&#x27;s impending demolition to make way for Philips Arena, a facility that would become home to Atlanta&#x27;s second NHL expansion team, the Atlanta Thrashers. During their years in Atlanta, Rick Morgan was their full-time national anthem singer and encouraged the crowd to shout &quot;KNIGHTS!&quot; during the line, &quot;Gave proof through the &quot;KNIGHTS&quot; that our flag was still there.&quot; It was customary to hear an emphasized, shouted &quot;KNIGHTS!&quot; during the national anthem at Atlanta Thrashers games at Philips Arena by spectators in honor of their team, and the tradition has carried over to Atlanta United FC soccer matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and to Atlanta Gladiators games at Gas South Arena.

<doc id="695791" wikidata="Q1346928" url="?curid=695791" title="Epic (game)">
<text>Epic is a collective term for a series of tabletop wargames by Games Workshop set in their fictional &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, particularly the &quot;Horus Heresy&quot; Whereas &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; involves small battles between forces of a few squads of troops and two or three vehicles, Epic features battles between armies consisting of dozens of tanks, giant war machines and hundreds of soldiers. Due to the comparatively larger size of the battles, &quot;Epic&quot; miniatures are smaller, roughly one quarter the size of those in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, with a typical human being represented with a 6mm high figure, as opposed to the &#x27;heroic&#x27; 28mm miniature used in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. 
The first release in 1988 was &quot;Adeptus Titanicus.&quot; dealing with large bipedal war machines. This was followed by &quot;Space Marines&quot; which added infantry and vehicles rules. The rules were comprehensively updated and the game reissued under the &quot;Epic&quot; name.

==Gameplay overview==
A standard game of &quot;Epic: Armageddon&quot; will normally take around two to three hours to play.

The major difference between &quot;Epic&quot; and other Games Workshop games is that instead of a player moving and firing all of their forces at once, players take turns moving one or two formations at a time using a variety of different &quot;orders&quot;, giving the feeling of a battlefield developing in real-time, and also resulting in a game that is more tactically complex than Warhammer 40,000.

The comparatively smaller size of the miniatures also allows players to use many of the larger vehicles and creatures of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, such as Titans and Super-Heavy Tanks, even in small games, whilst also allowing longer ranged weapons such as artillery to be more realistically portrayed.

Also of note is the introduction of blast markers: a simple system representing each formations degree of morale and suppression under fire which, again, adds another dimension of realism over some wargames.

Epic&#x27;s rule system incorporates Aircraft as well as ground units, and allows players to utilise many aircraft at once. Epic-scale aircraft are also used in the game &quot;Aeronautica Imperialis&quot;.

The monetary commitment needed to play &quot;Epic&quot; can be relatively small when compared with other Games Workshop products. Epic is comparable to W40K: Apocalypse in the sense that they both center around larger battlefields with a larger number of troops and vehicles in command, but the monetary investment is much smaller with Epic. Although Games Workshop and Forge World no longer offer a suitable line of troops and vehicles several companies and a thriving eBay trade have taken their place instead.

==Miniature availability and community support==

Plastic and metal Epic miniatures were previously available through the Specialist Games section of Games Workshop&#x27;s online store. with an additional lineup of resin models available via GW&#x27;s Forge World subsidiary. However, as of September 2013 Games Workshop confirmed that further casting and support for Epic along with all other Specialist Games would cease with miniatures being no longer available as stocks ran out: during this time Forgeworld also ceased producing suitable miniatures much to the dismay and anger of many fans of the game.

Despite this decline in &quot;official&quot; support Epic retains a loyal, strong and passionate fanbase with much development still taking place across the world. The Tactical Command Forums are a hub for a worldwide support including hobby advice and painting blogs which has in turn spawned the Net Epic Armageddon (NetEA) organization and rules committee. MiniWars provides a centralized website for all Epic Players to locate opponents, gain information on miniatures past and present as well as look up statlines for each unit. Additionally Epic-UK provides a well run tournament scene within the United Kingdom as well as testing and releasing their own in house balanced army lists often based on those of the wider NetEA .

Playing a game kept alive by its popularity after the demise of official support and miniature production, Epic fans have found many suitable proxies in the ranges of other up and running miniatures companies that bear a suitable resemblance to the desired units.
Of particular note are the Exodus Wars line from Steel Crown Productions who are also set to distribute Onslaught Miniatures for the UK and European Market. Additionally Troublemaker Games successfully crowdfunded a whole new line of miniatures in late 2013 that make suitable proxies for many epic forces including some of the first plastic 6mm sci-fi miniatures produced since Games Workshops last offerings.

== Epic Armageddon (4th Edition) ==

Unlike previous editions of the game and other games produced by Games Workshop, the development of the game was conducted in an open way with &#x27;trial&#x27; rules published on the Epic &#x27;Playtest Vault&#x27; and feedback solicited from gamers via the associated playtesters forum.

The fourth edition of &quot;Epic&quot; is often referred to as Epic: Armageddon after the first hard copy rulebook released for this edition. This includes the core game rules needed to play Epic:Armageddon as well as Army Lists of Space Marines, Imperial Guard and Orks.

The second rulebook released for the fourth edition was Epic: Swordwind, which was released both as hardcopy and as a downloadable PDF from the game&#x27;s official website. &quot;Epic: Swordwind&quot; contains army lists for the Biel-Tan Eldar, the Baran Siegemasters, Imperial Guard Army and Warlord Snagga-Snagga&#x27;s Feral Ork Horde. There has been active involvement of players with playtesting the new armies for the game on the Epic forums, with &quot;army champions&quot; co-ordinating playtesting and revision of the army lists. Unlike other Games Workshop games that use a generic army list for all deployments involving that army, &quot;Epic&quot; uses specific army lists that represent how an army was fielded in a specific military campaign. There have also been officially released army lists for Da Kult of Speed, an Ork army favouring bikes, the White Scars Space Marines, the Black Legion Chaos Space Marines, and The Lost and the Damned Chaos Cultist army.

The 4th edition also included rules and charts for the classic lines of Titan, including the Ork Mega-Gargant and the Imperator Titan. These were previously omitted from intermediate rulebook editions and their use made difficult given the deliberate absence of a points value befitting units of such scale. With work continuing on several community forums these units have once again been brought into use via some of the army lists.

Both &quot;official&quot; and &quot;wider community sanctioned&quot; versions of the rules are available as free download from Games Workshop and the newer Net Epic:Armageddon website as the &#x27;NetEA Tournament Pack&#x27; which brings together all current community endorsed rules changed as well as new and experimental army lists. This collaboration with the community has continued to this day with the development of further army lists and races now playable (see below).

==Adeptus Titanicus, Aeronautica Imperialis and Legions Imperialis==

In 2018 Games Workshop released a new edition of &quot;Adeptus Titanicus&quot;. Designer James M. Hewitt says &quot;While the game was clearly inspired by previous editions of Titanicus, as well as Epic, it&#x27;s very much its own new thing. We tried to make it so that it has lots of detail, but still plays quickly. The overall gist is that it puts you in the command throne of an individual Titan, so you are directing the action as shields and limbs take damage and crew succumb to the rigors of battle.&quot;

The Aeronautica Imperialis game will now be limited to the Horus Heresy setting and units from the Warhammer 40,000 game are no longer available.

In July 2023 a version of the Epic game was announced for release in August 2023, but later delayed until December 2023, with preorders announced for November 18, 2023. Named Warhammer: The Horus Heresy – Legions Imperialis, the game is set 10 thousand years earlier than the previous Warhammer 40,000 setting with a return to the Horus Heresy setting of the initial Space Marine game.

Replacement bases for Adeptus Titanicus and Aeronautica Imperialis units have also been announced.

==Previous versions and game history==
=== 1st edition===

The rules for the first edition of &quot;Epic&quot; were published in two parts.

The &quot;Adeptus Titanicus&quot; (1988) rules and miniatures set, which dealt with battles between opposing Imperial Titans, was published first. Rules for infantry and vehicles (the troops and vehicles of the Heresy era Space Marines) followed in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; 109.

&quot;Space Marine&quot;, another miniatures and rules set (for two opposing Space Marine armies), followed after (in 1989). The two could be played as individual games or as a combined game.

Where &quot;Adeptus Titanicus&quot; included six plastic Titan models with swappable weapons and styrofoam buildings, Space Marine included folded card buildings with styrene roofs alongside its sprues of infantry and vehicles.

Numerous articles supporting the &quot;Adeptus Titanicus&quot;/&quot;Space Marine&quot; game were released in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine including a variety of optional rules, army lists and organizational charts. The biggest supplement for the game was called &quot;Codex Titanicus&quot; (1989), which provided a medium for linking the Titan-based (giant robot) combat of &quot;Adeptus Titanicus&quot; with the conventional units (vehicles and infantry) of &quot;Space Marine&quot; 1st Edition. The codex also properly introduced Eldar Titans and Ork gargants

As months passed by, Adeptus Titanicus more or less stagnated apart from the introduction of smaller war machines called &quot;Knights&quot; (both Imperial and Exodite Eldar ones) and, later, the appearance of the mutated Chaos Titans. Space Marine, however, prospered with the release of a new army list system heavily based in semi-realistic orders of battle with support attachment, multi-tiered command structure and regimental/battalion levels. Imperial Guard, Ork, Eldar, Squat, Chaos, and Tyranid sprues of 6mm figures, artillery and support weapons were released while vehicles came in white metal and were sold in blisters containing, most often, two units apiece (single units appearing only in the case of larger models such as Shadowsword or Baneblade tanks).

===2nd edition===
The second edition of &quot;Epic&quot; was again released as two compatible but stand-alone games, Space Marine (1991) which consisted of the core rules, and Titan Legions (1994) which contained enhanced rules for Titans.

Various supplements were produced, including &quot;Armies of the Imperium&quot; (1991), which gave rules for the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, &quot;Renegades&quot; (1992) which had rules for the forces of Chaos and the Eldar, &quot;Ork and Squat Warlords&quot; (1992), which featured the Orks and Squats, &quot;Hive War&quot; (1995), which featured the Tyranids and &quot;White Dwarf Presents Space Marine Battles&quot; (1993) which was mostly reprints of &quot;Epic&quot;-related articles from White Dwarf.

The &quot;Space Marine&quot; boxed game included three armies; the Space Marines (with their Land Raiders MkI and Rhinos), Orks (with their Battlewagons), and Eldar (with their Falcon Grav-Tanks). The Marines were depicted the same as their Warhammer 40,000 Second Edition counterparts. There was also the plastic Imperial Warlord Titan MkI (nicknamed the &quot;Beetle&quot; due to its curves, while later Warlord Titans have a more angular design) with interchangeable weapons. The Games Workshop studio army was the Blood Angels Space Marines and Eldar from the Alaitoc Craftworld.

&quot;Titan Legions&quot; was notable for introducing the Imperial &quot;Emperor-class Imperator Titan&quot; and the Ork &quot;Mega-Gargants&quot;, all of which were immensely powerful and could constitute small armies in their own right. These &#x27;Mega&#x27; class vehicles could only be used in large games and none of the other races had such an equivalent. They were gradually phased out in later editions, though the current 4th edition has optional rules for them. The Imperator and Mega-Gargant are considered collectors&#x27; items today (the only other time that Games Workshop released them was as a &quot;reward&quot; in return for getting a yearly subscription to &quot;White Dwarf&quot; in the November 1997 issue). Besides one Imperator and two Mega-Gargants, the boxed set also contained ten Imperial Knights (these &quot;mini-Titans&quot; are also collectors&#x27; items) and twelve Ork Battlewagons.

The second edition of &quot;Epic&quot; was vastly popular and supported a huge range of miniatures.

A series of sculpts of Eldar Exodites, a Space Marine drop ship and other designs were made around the time of the &quot;Titan Legions&quot; debut, but were never officially released.

===3rd edition===
The third edition of &quot;Epic&quot; was released as Epic 40,000 in 1997. 
In contrast to previous editions, this was released as just one set of rules. The game had a very short period of support (six months) from the company before it was withdrawn. &quot;Epic 40,000&quot; never enjoyed the popularity of the previous two editions, and after support was reduced many of the miniatures planned for &quot;Epic 40,000&quot; were never released.

Though it was a failure for the company, designers Jervis Johnson and Andy Chambers still maintain that it was the best set of rules they ever conceived, as it was the game that most rewarded good tactics over luck and special abilities. This was achieved by streamlining the game mechanics and abstracting many of the areas which the previous editions had dealt with in specific detail. The current 4th edition of &quot;Epic&quot; still retains some of the third edition&#x27;s streamlined game mechanics.

As noted above, &quot;Epic&quot; became more streamlined during the third edition, in order to fit entirely within three (relatively thin) A5 rulebooks (the &quot;Rulebook&quot;, the &quot;Armies Book&quot; and the &quot;Battles Book&quot;). Army and Company Cards were eliminated and detachments were picked from largely unrestricted detachment rosters of a very general type (Imperial Guard Infantry, Space Marine Armour and so on, in the case of the Imperial army list). Titans and Super-Heavies (now collectively &quot;War Engines&quot;) were simplified to the point that their rules were contained entirely within six pages of the new small-format rulebook.

Collectively, this increased the speed of gameplay significantly, which was Games Workshop&#x27;s stated aim, but it received a mixed reaction, in part because it was considered too abstract and no longer accounted for unique features of certain units.

The boxed set contained the armies of Space Marines (including Rhinos, Land Raiders MkII, and Whirlwinds) and Orks (with their Battlewagons and Stompas). The cover art showed a Blood Angels Space Marine advance pushing away the Orks. Games Workshop&#x27;s &#x27;studio&#x27; army during this period was the Imperial Fists chapter, a departure from previous feature armies which usually depicted the Ultramarines or Blood Angels. Armies for other races included the Imperial Guard, Eldar (studio armies were the Biel-Tan and Iyanden Craftworlds), and Tyranids. Imperial players had a choice of Space Marines or Imperial Guard, with support from Titan Legions. There were two distinct designs of Titan Legions, either Games Workshop&#x27;s Mars-Pattern Titans which appear more traditional and ornamental with rounded shoulder pads (similar to a scaled-up Imperial Knight walker), or Forge World&#x27;s Lucius-Pattern Titans which are more modern and angular (inspired by bipedal mechs in BattleTech).

Although miniatures from early editions were still playable and interchangeable, it was at this time they changed the basic base/stand size for infantry from square 20x20 to a longer version 10x40 which although they could be played or fielded in battle together it changed a lot for those who already had square based armies.

===Computer Games===

&quot;Final Liberation: Warhammer 40,000 Epic&quot;, a turn-based strategy game for the PC, was released in 1997.

Slitherine released a full Armageddon version of the game in 2015 called &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon&quot;. The game primarily puts you in charge of Imperial command mixed with various Space Marine Chapters. The game has a lot of DLC and features easily over 1,000 unit types. It boasts that no other game has gone into as much detail as it has. Due to its success it had a sequel shortly after featuring an Orc campaign featuring over 400 units. Although the game does not feature animated graphics and it uses an old tried and tested turn based strategy formula, the game is a hit with the community.

====Spin-offs====
Spin-offs from this edition included the &quot;Epic Firepower&quot; magazine, an A5 magazine started in 1998 which ran for four issues (the first of which contained reprints from &quot;Citadel Journal&quot; and &quot;White Dwarf&quot;), the &quot;Epic 40,000 Magazine&quot;, an A4 magazine which picked up where &quot;Epic Firepower&quot; left off for 10 issues.

An additional rule set called Adeptus Titanicus II (AT-II) came out as a free download on the Fanatic website, which is now the Specialist Games web site, and was included in the &quot;Epic 40,000 Magazine&quot;. AT-II put a new twist on the original Adeptus Titanicus game and articles for it were also printed in the various Epic magazines until they were cancelled and later became a free webzine on the Specialist Games web site.

=== Other Fan editions ===

====NetEpic====

&quot;NetEpic&quot; is an unofficial fan version of the game derived from the 2nd Edition rules, started originally because many players did not like the changes made for the third edition. &quot;NetEpic&quot; is a collaborative effort, with work being coordinated through the &quot;NetEpic&quot; website. It includes a broad range of armies based on models from all the other editions, as well as some created especially for &quot;NetEpic&quot; itself. As of March 2006, the &quot;NetEpic&quot; rules are currently at version 5.0.

====Heresy====
In the context of &quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Heresy&quot; can refer to either a Games Workshop in-house game that was abandoned before the first edition of &quot;Epic&quot; was created but later used as a basis for the third edition, or to a more &quot;gritty&quot; game mechanics version of &quot;Epic&quot; which was produced by Peter Ramos, co-ordinator of the &quot;NetEpic&quot; project (Ramos, 2005).

<text>Rafael Cordero y Molina (October 24, 1790 – July 5, 1868), known as Maestro Cordero, was a self-educated Afro–Puerto Rican who provided free schooling to the children of his city regardless of race or social standing.

In 2003, the Catholic Church began the process of Cordero&#x27;s beatification. In 2013, Pope Francis recognized him as Venerable.

==Early years==
Cordero was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, into a low-income family. He was one of three children, born to Lucas Cordero and Rita Molina. His two older sisters were Gregoria and Celestina. His father worked in the tobacco fields, while his mother tended the house. Cordero, who was of African ancestry, was self-educated. His love of literature and his determination to teach others and educate himself helped him develop the skills and preparation to teach primary school. Cordero received the sacrament of Confirmation at the age of 14 from Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi (1760–1814), the first native bishop of the island. He grew up and lived his life as a devout Catholic. In 1802, his older sister Celestina, also a pious Catholic, established a &quot;escuela de amigas&quot; for girls on the island.

==Career==
In 1826 Cordero established a free school for all the children in his house. He taught children regardless of their race and those who could not afford an education otherwise. There, he taught reading, calligraphy, mathematics, and religious instruction. Among the distinguished alumni who attended Cordero&#x27;s school were José Julian Acosta, Román Baldorioty de Castro and Alejandro Tapia y Rivera. Cordero maintained his educational center for 58 years at Luna Street. He proved that racial and economic integration could be possible and accepted.

Cordero was awarded the &quot;Premio de Virtud&quot; by the Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País en Puerto Rico, an economic club whose members were friends of Puerto Rico. He was given 100 pesos, which he, in turn, gave away to those in need. He used half of the money (50 pesos) to buy books and clothes for his students, and the other half was given to the homeless.

He was a great agitator for the abolition of slavery:
==Death==
The people&#x27;s love and respect for Cordero were evidenced by the fact that more than 2,000 people attended his funeral in 1868.

==Honors and veneration==
Puerto Rican poet José Gualberto Padilla published a poem titled &quot;El maestro Rafael&quot; honoring the educator. In 1891, Rafael Cordero was immortalized in a painting titled &quot;La Escuela del Maestro Rafael Cordero&quot; by the artist Francisco Oller which can be seen in the Puerto Rican Athenaeum.
 The Puerto Rico Teachers Association annually awards the teacher who has distinguished himself or herself in the field of public or private education with the National Medal Rafael Cordero. There are various schools named after him, among them a high school in San Juan, an elementary school in Aguadilla, an elementary school in Jersey City, New Jersey, and a Junior High School in Brooklyn, New York.

In 2003, the Catholic Church, upon the request of the Archbishop of San Juan, Roberto González Nieves, O.F.M., began the process of Cordero&#x27;s beatification. This is the first step on the road to possible canonization. On December 9, 2013, Pope Francis advanced the cause for Cordero when he declared that Cordero had heroically lived the Christian virtues and has been declared Venerable.

<doc id="695796" wikidata="Q1070293" url="?curid=695796" title="Red-cheeked cordon-bleu">
<text>The red-cheeked cordon-bleu or red-cheeked cordonbleu (Uraeginthus bengalus) is a small passerine bird in the family Estrildidae. This estrildid finch is a resident breeding bird in drier regions of tropical Sub-Saharan Africa. Red-cheeked cordon-bleu has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 7,700,000 km2.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-cheeked cordon-bleu in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in Bengal. He used the French name &quot;Le Bengali&quot; and the Latin &quot;Bengalus&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-cheeked cordon-bleu. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla bengalus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;bengalus&quot; is based on the erroneous belief that the species came from Bengal. The type location was subsequently designated as Senegal. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Uraeginthus&quot; that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1851.

The red-cheeked cordon-bleu, the blue-capped cordon-bleu, and the blue waxbill form a species group within the genus. Further, the red-cheeked cordon-bleu may form a superspecies with the blue waxbill, with which it shares similar habitats.

There are four subspecies, which differ primarily in the amount of blue on the face and underparts of the females.

* &quot;U. b. bengalus&quot; – south Mauritania to Guinea and east to Ethiopia, Uganda and west Kenya
* &quot;U. b. brunneigularis&quot; – south Somalia, central and east Kenya and northeast Tanzania
* &quot;U. b. ugogensis&quot; – south Kenya and north, west and central Tanzania
* &quot;U. b. katangae&quot; – northeast Angola, south Democratic Republic of the Congo and north Zambia

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the red-cheeked cordon-bleu is a very small finch, measuring only in length. It weighs on average, with known extremes in wild populations ranging from . The adult male has uniformly brown upperparts, pale blue breast, flanks and tail and a yellow belly. There is a red patch on each cheek, but this can rarely appear orange or even yellow. Females are similar but duller, and lack the cheek spot. Immature birds are like the female, but with blue restricted to the face and throat.

===Voice===
Its contact call is a thin, high-pitched piping, often repeated, and variously transcribed as &quot;siii siii&quot; or &quot;tsee tsee&quot;. The song is more complex, consisting of 4–6 high-pitched notes, the last of which is longer, lower and more burry. Described as &quot;rhythmic but lazy&quot;, it has been transcribed as &quot;wit-sit-diddley-diddley-ee-ee&quot;. Unlike many other passerines, but like all cordon-bleu species, female red-cheeked cordon-bleus sing; they also help to defend a small area around their nest site. Their song is less complex than that of the males, and they sing less frequently. Female song peaks primarily before egg-laying, and is thought to help with pair bond maintenance or breeding synchronization.

==Habitat and range==
The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is common and widespread across much of central and eastern Africa. Its range stretches from the West African countries of Senegal, Gambia and southwestern Mauritania east through southern Mali, southern Niger, southern Chad and southern Sudan to Ethiopia and northwestern and southwestern Somalia, and then south to southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, eastern Angola, northern and western Zambia, southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique. It has also been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and Oahu. It has been found one time (in 1924) on Cape Verde and was recorded in the Maadi area in northern Egypt during the mid-1960s; the latter birds may have been escaped cage birds, as there have been no records since. It has been photographed in the Los Angeles Area (5/19/20) as well.

It is found in all habitats except forest interiors, at elevations ranging from sea level to .

==Behaviour==
It is frequently seen at open dry grassland and savanna habitats as well as around human habitation.

===Feeding===
The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is a granivore, feeding principally on grass seeds, but also on millet and other small seeds. It is also known to feed sporadically on beeswax. Larger granivores, such as the pin-tailed whydah will chase cordon-bleus from food sources, limiting the feeding opportunities of the smaller birds and affecting their foraging success.

===Breeding===
The nest is a large domed grass structure with a side entrance in a tree, bush or thatch into which 4–5 white eggs are laid.

==Aviculture==
The red-cheeked cordon-bleu is reported to be &quot;among the most popular exotic finches&quot;. While it has no special housing requirements, its habit of roosting on open branches (rather than in a nest or other protected area) makes it sensitive to low temperatures. During the breeding season, captive males become very aggressive towards each other, and birds disturbed during incubation will typically leave the nest.

<doc id="695803" wikidata="Q1368948" url="?curid=695803" title="Glenn Strange">
<text>George Glenn Strange (August 16, 1899 – September 20, 1973) was an American actor who appeared in hundreds of Western films. He played Sam Noonan, the bartender on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; television series, and Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in three Universal films during the 1940s.

==Early life==
Strange was born in Weed, New Mexico Territory, of Irish and Cherokee ancestry. He spoke Cherokee until he was about 13 years old, but in 1972 he stated &quot;since that time I&#x27;ve had nobody to speak it with, so I’ve lost it.&quot;

He grew up on a ranch, and left school after eighth grade, for his father thought he had enough education to work with cattle. When he was 12 he began playing the fiddle at local dances. In 1928 he began performing music on an El Paso radio station. Another early job was heavy-weight boxing, which caused some &quot;cauliflower&quot; damage to his right ear.

Strange competed in the Hoot Gibson rodeo, but was injured when a horse fell on him. After the injury Gibson looked after him, and Strange began playing outlaws in Gibson&#x27;s Western films.

==Career==

For much of Strange&#x27;s acting career most of his roles were playing &quot;bad guys.&quot; He had roles in 300 films and 500 television episodes.

In 1932 he had a minor role as part of the Wrecker&#x27;s gang in a 12-part serial, &quot;The Hurricane Express&quot;, starring John Wayne. He played numerous small parts in Paramount&#x27;s popular &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot; film series, usually cast as a member of an outlaw&#x27;s gang and occasionally as a local sheriff. In 1943, he played a badman in the Hopalong Cassidy movie &quot;False Colors&quot;. He played the killer Naylor Rand in the 1948 film &quot;Red River&quot;.

Beginning in 1949, he portrayed Butch Cavendish, the villain responsible for killing all but one of the Texas Rangers in the long-running television series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. Strange appeared twice as Jim Wade on Bill Williams&#x27;s syndicated Western series geared to juvenile audiences &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot;. He also appeared twice as Blake in the syndicated Western &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;. In 1952, he was cast in the role of Chief Black Cloud in the episode &quot;Indian War Party&quot; of the syndicated &quot;The Range Rider&quot;. In 1954, Strange played Sheriff Billy Rowland in Jim Davis&#x27;s syndicated Western series &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;. Strange appeared six times in 1956 in multiple roles on Edgar Buchanan&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Judge Roy Bean&quot;. That same year, Strange appeared in an uncredited role as the sheriff in Silver Rapids in the Western movie &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; starring Glenn Ford. In 1958, he had a minor part in an episode of John Payne&#x27;s &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, and had an important role in the 1958 episode &quot;Chain Gang&quot; of the Western series &quot;26 Men&quot;, true stories about the Arizona Rangers. That same year, he played rancher Pat Cafferty, who faces the threat of anthrax, in the episode &quot;Queen of the Cimarron&quot; of the syndicated Western series, &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;. Strange appeared in six episodes of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; playing the same role in different variations: Cole, the stagecoach driver, in &quot;Duel of Honor&quot;; a stagecoach shotgun guard in &quot;The Dead-eye Kid&quot;; Joey, a stagecoach driver in &quot;The Woman&quot;; and an unnamed stagecoach driver in &quot;The Blowout&quot;, &quot;The Spiked Rifle&quot;, and &quot;Miss Bertie&quot;.

Strange had parts in the ABC Western &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, plus &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill, Jr.&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; and other Western television series. He played an Indian Chief in &quot;Rawhide&quot; S2 E8 &quot;Incident of the Haunted Hills&quot; which aired 11/5/1959.

===Gunsmoke===
He first appeared on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1960 after James Arness asked him, &quot;When are you going to do a Gunsmoke? I like to work with big guys.&quot; During Gunsmoke&#x27;s sixth season, Strange played a Long Branch customer in &quot;Old Faces&quot; and a cowboy in &quot;Melinda Miles&quot;.

Strange began playing Sam Noonan during the seventh season, and continued on in the role for 222 episodes. In 1972 Strange was diagnosed with lung cancer, but worked as long as he was able. Five of his episodes were broadcast after his death. His last appearance was on the November 26, 1973 episode &quot;The Hanging of Newly O’Brien&quot;.

===Frankenstein===


In 1944, while Strange was being made up for an action film at Universal, make-up artist Jack Pierce noticed that Strange&#x27;s facial features and 6&#x27;4&quot; height would be appropriate for the role of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. Strange was cast in the 1944 film &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; in the role first played by Boris Karloff in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), coached by Karloff personally after hours. Karloff later said he was dissatisfied with Strange&#x27;s performances as the monster, commenting, &quot;Well, he wasn&#x27;t as lucky as I was. I got the cream of it, being the first. I know I wished him lots of luck... hoping it would do as much for him as it did for me, but...&quot;

Previously to &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot;, Strange starred as Petro, who is turned into a wolf-monster by George Zucco, in &quot;The Mad Monster&quot; (1943). Another role in a horror film was in 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Monster Maker&quot;. He also appeared as &quot;The Giant&quot; in the mystery film &quot;The Black Raven&quot; (1943).

Strange reprised the role of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945). Strange played the monster a third time in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948); as in his first two Frankenstein films, he shared the spotlight with Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man, but this time John Carradine was replaced by Bela Lugosi, in his second screen appearance as Count Dracula. Strange also appeared in character with Lou Costello in a haunted house skit on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; and made a gag publicity appearance as a masked flagpole-sitter for a local Los Angeles TV show in the 1950s. After weeks of the station teasing the public about the sitter&#x27;s identity, Strange removed his mask and revealed himself as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster (actually, yet another mask). Strange also played a monster in the Bowery Boys horror-comedy &quot;Master Minds&quot; in 1949, mimicking the brain-transplanted Huntz Hall&#x27;s frantic comedy movements, with Hall providing his own dubbed voice.

During the wave of monster-related merchandising in the late 1950s and 1960s, Glenn Strange&#x27;s iconic image often was used for the monster on toys, games, and paraphernalia, most often from his appearance in the Abbott and Costello film. In 1969, &quot;The New York Times&quot; mistakenly published Boris Karloff&#x27;s obituary with Glenn Strange&#x27;s picture as the Frankenstein monster.

==Death==
On September 20, 1973, at age 74, Strange died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California. Singer Eddie Dean, with whom Strange had collaborated on various songs and opening themes for films, sang at Strange&#x27;s funeral service as a final tribute. Strange is interred at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

<doc id="695808" wikidata="Q42257" url="?curid=695808" title="Walther WA 2000">
<text>The Walther WA 2000 is a semi-automatic bullpup sniper rifle produced by the Carl Walther GmbH Sportwaffen company from 1978 to 1988. The WA2000 was introduced to the markets in 1981 and was produced in three different calibers. Production of the rifle was limited and it was shortly stopped because it was too expensive to achieve widespread sales and not robust enough for military use as a sniper rifle. Only 176 were built due to its high manufacturing cost, making it one of the rarest and most sought-after production firearms ever made.

==Design==
The WA 2000 was designed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in response to the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. 

The bullpup design was chosen to shorten weapon-length, whilst mostly preserving the accuracy and ballistic-performance of an otherwise full-length rifle. The WA 2000 had a quick-detachable scope mount with a weight of . The rifle did not have iron sights. The most commonly used optical sight was a Schmidt &amp; Bender 2.5–10× telescopic sight. Without scope the rifle has an unloaded weight of and a loaded weight of .

The .300 Winchester Magnum round was chosen as the primary caliber because of its long range accuracy and its precision at all ranges. The entire rifle is designed around the barrel. The WA 2000 fires from a closed bolt and uses a bolt with seven locking lugs. It has either a single-stage trigger or a two-stage trigger with a trigger pull of 1.2 to 1.4 kg (2.65 to 3.1 lb). The rifle uses single stack box magazines with a 6-round capacity, which weigh when loaded.

==Variants==
The WA 2000 is chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, 7.62×51mm NATO, and 7.5×55mm Swiss.

Only 176 total rifles were produced, and in two different variants. The two variants can be differentiated by the type of flash suppressor used: the first, the older model, uses a &quot;can&quot; type flash suppressor; whereas the second generation and newer model uses the more conventional &quot;flash-hider/compensator&quot; design. The second generation incorporated several changes improving the rifle&#x27;s accuracy, making it more suited to its intended job.

==Production==
The rifle was produced from 1982 until November 1988. The rifle was used by some German police units, but production was stopped because it was too expensive to achieve widespread sales. It was never adopted by a military unit due to its cost and not being robust enough for field service. The final retail cost for a base rifle in the 1980s was in the range of $9,000 to $12,500, and the rifle&#x27;s current value ranges from $40,000 for the first generation to $75,000 for the second generation.

<doc id="695818" wikidata="Q560326" url="?curid=695818" title="Red-billed firefinch">
<text>The red-billed firefinch or Senegal firefinch (Lagonosticta senegala) is a small seed-eating bird in the family Estrildidae. This is a resident breeding bird in most of Sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. It was introduced to Egypt, but the population there has become extinct. It was also introduced to southern Algeria where it is currently expanding northward.
==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-billed firefinch in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;Le Sénégali rouge&quot; and the Latin name &quot;Senegalus Ruber&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-billed firefinch. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla senegala&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Lagonosticta&quot; that was introduced by the German ornithologists Jean Cabanis in 1851.

There are six subspecies:

* &quot;L. s. senegala&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Nominate subspecies – Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia to west and central Nigeria
* &quot;L. s. rhodopsis&quot; (Heuglin, 1863) – &quot;Sahel red-billed firefinch or Adamawa red-billed firefinch&quot; – east Nigeria, north and central Cameroon and south Chad to Sudan, west Eritrea and west Ethiopia
* &quot;L. s. brunneiceps&quot; Sharpe, 1890 – &quot;Abyssinian red-billed firefinch&quot; – central Ethiopia and southeast Sudan
* &quot;L. s. somaliensis&quot; Salvadori, 1894 – &quot;Lake Abaya red-billed firefinch or Somali red-billed firefinch&quot; – southeast Ethiopia and south Somalia
* &quot;L. s. ruberrima&quot; Reichenow, 1903 – &quot;Uganda red-billed firefinch&quot; – Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and west Kenya to northeast Angola, northeast Zambia and north Malawi
* &quot;L. s. rendalli&quot; Hartert, 1898 – &quot;Southern red-billed firefinch&quot; – south Angola to Mozambique south to South Africa

==Description==
The red-billed firefinch is in length. The adult male has entirely scarlet plumage apart from brown wings. The bill is pink, and there is a yellow eye-ring. Females have uniformly brown upperparts and buff underparts. There is a small red patch in front of both eyes, with the bill also being pink.

== Range and habitat ==
This widespread and abundant species is often found around human habitation, often with other species such as the red-cheeked cordon-bleu. Its soft &quot;queet-queet&quot; call is a familiar African sound. The song is a rising &quot;chick-pea-pea-pea&quot;.

The red-billed firefinch is a small gregarious bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open grassland and cultivation. The nest is a large domed grass structure with a side entrance, built low in a bush, wall or thatch into which three to six white eggs are laid. The nest of this species is parasitised by the village indigobird.

<doc id="695824" wikidata="Q436187" url="?curid=695824" title="George Raft">
<text>George Raft ( Ranft; September 26, 1901 – November 24, 1980) was an American film actor and dancer identified with portrayals of gangsters in crime melodramas of the 1930s and 1940s. A stylish leading man in dozens of movies, Raft is remembered for his gangster roles in &quot;Quick Millions&quot; (1931) with Spencer Tracy, &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932) with Paul Muni, &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot; (1939) with James Cagney, &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot; (1939) with Humphrey Bogart, and Billy Wilder&#x27;s comedy &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959) with Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon; and as a dancer in &quot;Bolero&quot; (1934) with Carole Lombard and a truck driver in &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940) with Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and Bogart.

==Early life and career==
Raft was born at 415 West 41st Street in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City, the son of Eva ( Glockner), a German Jewish immigrant, and Conrad Ranft, who was born in Massachusetts to German Jewish immigrants. His parents were married on November 17, 1895, in Manhattan. Raft&#x27;s sister Eva, known as Katie, was born on April 18, 1896. Raft&#x27;s grandfather had emigrated from Germany and worked on merry-go-rounds and prospected for gold. His father worked in carnivals before settling in New York.

Most obituaries cited Raft&#x27;s year of birth as 1895, which he stated was correct when he appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; seven months prior to his death. However, Raft is recorded in the New York City Birth Index as having been born on September 26, 1901, in Manhattan as &quot;George Rauft&quot; (although &quot;Rauft&quot; is likely a mistranscription of &quot;Ranft&quot;). The 1900 census for New York City lists his sister Katie as his parents&#x27; only child, with two children born and only one living. In the 1910 census, he is listed as eight years old.

Raft grew up on 41st Street and worked as an errand boy and a fishwrapper after school. His parents sent him to live at his grandparents&#x27; house on 164th Street. He left school at the age of 12, and left home at 13. He worked as an apprentice electrician for a year, then boxed professionally for two years beginning at the age of 15. As Dutch Rauft, he fought 14 bouts, with nine victories, three defeats and two draws. Another account says that Raft fought 25 bouts and was knocked out seven times.

Raft played minor-league baseball, reportedly with Springfield of the Eastern League, as a utility outfielder with pitching aspirations. However, his batting was poor and he was dropped.

&quot;I was just trying to find something that I liked that would make me a living,&quot; said Raft later. &quot;I saw guys fighting, so I fought. I saw guys playing ball, so I played ball. Then I saw guys dancing... and getting paid for it!&quot;

===Career as a dancer===
Raft&#x27;s mother taught him how to dance, and he danced at outdoor amusement parks and carnivals with his parents. Following his baseball career, he began working as a taxi dancer in the poorer sections of New York. At first he struggled financially, but then he won a Charleston competition and was launched professionally.

Raft started performing exhibition dances in the afternoon at Healy&#x27;s, Murray&#x27;s, Rectors and Churchills in New York. He then started working in New York City nightclubs, often in the same venues as did Rudolph Valentino before Valentino became a film actor. Raft had a notable collaboration with Elsie Pilcer. A May 1924 review in &quot;Variety&quot; called him &quot;gifted.&quot;

&quot;I could have been the first X-rated dancer,&quot; he said later. &quot;I was very erotic. I used to caress myself as I danced. I never felt I was a great dancer. I was more of a stylist, unique. I was never a Fred Astaire or a Gene Kelly, but I was sensuous.&quot;

Raft went on tour as a dancer and helped popularize the tango in Paris, Vienna, Rome, London and New York. He had a great success as a dancer in London in 1926, and the Duke of Windsor was &quot;an ardent fan and supporter.&quot; Fred Astaire, in his autobiography &quot;Steps in Time&quot; (1959), wrote that Raft was a lightning-fast dancer and did &quot;the fastest Charleston I ever saw.&quot; A September 1926 edition of &quot;Variety&quot; spoke of Raft&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the best Charleston dancer in New York.&quot;

During this time, Raft befriended a number of gangsters, including Enoch Johnson and Larry Fay, and he would occasionally drive for Owney Madden. A boyhood friend of gangster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, and later a &quot;wheel man&quot; for the mob, Raft acknowledged having narrowly avoided a life of crime.

===Broadway===
Raft became part of the stage act of flamboyant speakeasy and nightclub hostess Texas Guinan at the 300 Club, and he also produced some of her shows.

His success led him to Broadway, where he again worked as a dancer. His stage performances included &quot;The City Chap&quot; (October 1925) (with music by Jerome Kern), &quot;Gay Paree&quot;, &quot;Madhattan&quot;, &quot;Palm Beach Nights&quot; (also known as &quot;No Foolin&quot;&#x27;) and &quot;Padlocks of 1927&quot; (1927). He was called &quot;the fastest Charleston dancer.&quot;

Raft later starred in the film &quot;Broadway&quot; (1942), a fictionalized account of his life when he was working the Paramount-Publix circuit and performing in stage shows that were presented before movies.

==Los Angeles and early films==
Owney Madden told Raft that he should be in motion pictures, and Raft decided to try to break into film acting after being threatened by the husband of a woman whom he had been seeing. In 1927, Raft relocated to Hollywood, where he first danced in clubs to pay the bills.

In October 1928, Raft appeared in a stage show presented by Texas Guinan called &quot;Night Club&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Raft &quot;scores a tremendous individual hit.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Raft appeared at the climax when he &quot;came to the front and did his eccentric dance routine, which he climaxed with the hottest black bottom ever. He goaled the audience, being the big punch of the show.&quot;

===Film debut===
Raft&#x27;s screen debut was in &quot;Queen of the Night Clubs&quot; starring Guinan, who insisted Raft have a small role. Although Raft&#x27;s scenes were cut, a &quot;Variety&quot; review said &quot;...a nite club scene introduces George Raft, the hot stepper, as the m. c. and band leader, being brought down for one of his rip-snorting hoofing specialties.&quot; Raft also appeared in stage shows supporting the film. One reviewer called him &quot;a clever dancer&quot;. &quot;Queen of the Night Clubs&quot; is considered a lost film.

Raft followed this with small roles in &quot;Gold Diggers of Broadway&quot; and &quot;Side Street&quot;. His dancing skills were noticed by director Rowland Brown, who cast him in a substantial supporting gangster role as Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;Quick Millions&quot; (1931). Raft&#x27;s appearances in these films were followed by &quot;Goldie&quot; with Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow, &quot;Hush Money&quot; with Joan Bennett, and the Eddie Cantor musical &quot;Palmy Days&quot;.

In &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1932), starring James Cagney and Loretta Young, Raft had a colorful unbilled dancing role as Cagney&#x27;s competitor in a dance contest, who wins only to be knocked down by Cagney. He was third-billed in an extremely large role as a gangster in &quot;Dancers in the Dark&quot; (1932), below Miriam Hopkins as a dancer and Jack Oakie as a bandleader.

Raft said he never regarded himself as an actor. &quot;I wanted to be me,&quot; he said.

===&quot;Scarface&quot;===
Raft&#x27;s big break came when cast as the second lead, alongside Paul Muni, as Tony Camonte in Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Scarface&quot;. In the film, he plays second-in-command Guino Rinaldo, who falls in love with Camonte&#x27;s sister and is murdered by him. Raft&#x27;s performance is notable for his character&#x27;s habit of flipping a coin, which became an iconic trope in gangster films; while others claimed credit for the mannerism, writer W.R. Burnett confirmed that it was Raft who invented it. Burnett said: &quot;He realized he wasn&#x27;t a good actor, which he wasn&#x27;t. But he knew if he reacted to what other people said, he was effective.&quot;

&quot;Scarface&quot; was filmed in September 1931. It was released by United Artists in 1932. It became a hit and made Raft a star. He said: &quot;That was the big one. People remembered me. I was getting real fan mail – by the bushel basket – and even a dumb kid from 10th Avenue could figure out how to translate that into money.&quot;

After filming &quot;Scarface&quot;, Raft made &quot;Night World&quot; (1932) at Universal, supporting Lew Ayres, and &quot;Love Is a Racket&quot;, directed by William Wellman, although all of Raft&#x27;s scenes were eventually cut.

===Paramount===
Raft signed a contract with Paramount in March 1932. The following month, he was cast in a supporting role in &quot;Madame Racketeer&quot; (1932), and contemporary reports referred to his &quot;menacing suavity.&quot; He was announced for &quot;Ladies of the Big House&quot; with Sylvia Sidney and Gene Raymond.

===&quot;Night After Night&quot; (1932)===
When &quot;Scarface&quot; was released, public response was so strong that Raft was offered the lead role in a film based on a story by Louis Bromfeld, originally titled &quot;Number 55&quot; and then changed to &quot;Night After Night&quot; (1932). 

Raft was one of several Paramount stars who appeared in the episodic comedy/drama &quot;If I Had a Million&quot; (1932), playing a forger hiding from police who is suddenly given a million dollars with no place to cash the check. He starred in &quot;Under-Cover Man&quot; (1932) and was announced for &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, which was never made. He next appeared in &quot;Pick Up&quot; (1933). A natural practitioner of a form of method acting, Raft told &quot;Variety&quot;:
I don&#x27;t know what I do, but it&#x27;s not acting. It&#x27;s me. Supposing I&#x27;m supposed to hate a guy. Then I think of somebody I hate and visualize him instead of the actor. Same way when I&#x27;m supposed to be in love with the heroine. I think of a girl I could be crazy about and though I&#x27;m saying to the actress &quot;I love you, darling&quot;, all the time I keep thinking of the other party.

===First suspension===
Raft refused to appear in &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; (1933) with Miriam Hopkins, as he did not want to play a sadist. He was replaced by Jack La Rue, who had been originally cast for Raft&#x27;s role in &quot;Scarface&quot;. Raft was placed on suspension in February.

He said: &quot;It&#x27;s not that I mind being the guy on the wrong side of the law. But I won&#x27;t take a role that&#x27;s pure heel. The character has to have some ray of warmth, some redeeming quality – or it just isn&#x27;t real.&quot;

&quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; performed poorly at the box office and was believed to have hurt La Rue&#x27;s career. Raft was removed from suspension in April 1933, and he returned to Hollywood to appear in &quot;Midnight Club&quot; (1933), set in London.

===&quot;The Bowery&quot; (1933)===
Raft was borrowed by Twentieth Century Pictures, a new production company established by Darryl F. Zanuck (former head of production at Warner Bros.). He appeared in the studio&#x27;s first film, Raoul Walsh&#x27;s highly popular and energetic period piece &quot;The Bowery&quot;, as Steve Brodie, supposedly the first man to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and survive. Raft plays the second lead to Wallace Beery as a flamboyant saloon owner who competes with Raft for Fay Wray&#x27;s character as well as Pert Kelton as a singer/dancer.

Back at Paramount, Raft supported Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins in &quot;All of Me&quot; (1934), which was not popular. Zanuck wanted him for &quot;Blood Money&quot;, but Raft was too busy at Paramount.

===&quot;Bolero&quot; (1934)===
Raft was meant to appear in &quot;It&#x27;s a Pleasure to Lose&quot;, based on the life of Nick the Greek, but instead was slated to star in &quot;Bolero&quot; (1934), playing a dancer with Carole Lombard. Raft initially refused the film until it was re-written, and the studio suspended him, but Raft eventually made the film, which became a great success. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Raft is a vivid and pictorially interesting type, rather than an actor in the technical sense, and consequently he proves unequal to the full implications of the fame-hungry dancer. The exterior attractiveness which Mr. Raft brings to the rôle gives &#x27;Bolero&#x27; considerable color, nevertheless.&quot;

In March 1934, Raft was suspended a second time for having refused the male lead in Mae West&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t No Sin&quot; (later changed to &quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot;) because his part was subordinate to West&#x27;s. In May 1934, Raft signed a new contract with Paramount to reflect his star status.

Raft next appeared in &quot;The Trumpet Blows&quot; (1934), playing a matador. The film was an attempt to invoke Valentino&#x27;s &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, and for a time, Raft was promoted as a &quot;second Valentino.&quot; Raft walked out on the film unhappy with his role, but later returned after re-writes were made. The film was a box-office disappointment.

Raft then starred in &quot;Limehouse Blues&quot; (1934) with Anna May Wong. In February 1934, he admitted to having been involved in three fights during his career as a dancer and actor, including one in which he hit the producer of &quot;Bolero&quot;. In August 1934, Raft was involved in a brawl at the Hollywood Brown Derby. At the end of 1934, Raft was listed in a survey of theater managers as among Paramount&#x27;s secondary tier of stars &quot;if properly cast.&quot;

In &quot;Rumba&quot; (1935), Raft was reunited with Lombard. He also starred in &quot;Stolen Harmony&quot; (1935) and was slated to appear in &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Maxim&quot; from a story by James Edward Grant, but the film was not made.

===&quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1935)===
Raft starred in a brutal and fast-paced adaptation of Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1935). He tried a comedy, &quot;Every Night at Eight&quot; (1935), and was borrowed by Columbia Pictures to appear in &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t Take It&quot; (1935), a comedy in the vein of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). He then was borrowed by 20th Century-Fox for &quot;It Had to Happen&quot; (1936) and starred in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Yours for the Asking&quot; (1936).

Raft was meant to team with Lombard for a third time in &quot;The Princess Comes Across&quot; (1936), but refused to make the film as he was unhappy with the choice of cameraman. He was replaced by Fred MacMurray and was suspended again in February 1936. He was scheduled to star in &quot;You and Me&quot;, the directorial debut of Norman Krasna, but he refused to work for a first-time director. Raft was put on suspension and $24,000 of his salary was withheld. In October 1936, he reconciled with Paramount and the studio returned his $24,000.

===&quot;Souls at Sea&quot; (1937)===
Raft was offered a part opposite the studio&#x27;s top male star Gary Cooper in &quot;Souls at Sea&quot; (1937), directed by Henry Hathaway. Raft originally turned it down as his character was a coward, leaving Paramount and his $4,000-per-week contract in November 1936, though the contract still had two years remaining. Samuel Goldwyn wanted Raft for the film version of &quot;Dead End&quot; and Universal, David O. Selznick and 20th Century Fox were keen on using Raft. Lloyd Nolan was announced as Raft&#x27;s replacement in &quot;Souls at Sea&quot;. Raft was discussing a three-films-per-year deal with United Artists for three years, to start with &quot;Dead End&quot;. However, Raft agreed to return to Paramount and &quot;Souls at Sea&quot; when his part was re-written to be more sympathetic. &quot;Souls at Sea&quot; was a great hit, and in 1937 Raft was the third-highest-paid star in Hollywood (behind Cooper and Warner Baxter), earning $202,666. In May 1937, Raft reportedly tested for the role of Rhett Butler for the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

Paramount announced Raft for &quot;Millions for Defense&quot; with Ray Milland and Frances Farmer, a film about the Barbary War, but the picture was not made. Instead, Raft appeared with Sylvia Sidney in Fritz Lang&#x27;s drama &quot;You and Me&quot; (1938), and was next reunited with Hathaway to star in another adventure story, &quot;Spawn of the North&quot; (1938), with Henry Fonda and John Barrymore playing supporting roles.

Raft was announced for the films &quot;The World Applauds&quot; and &quot;Two-Time Loser&quot;.

Paramount wanted Raft to appear in &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, but he refused and was replaced by Lloyd Nolan. &quot;Raft is Hollywood&#x27;s authority on walk outs,&quot; wrote one columnist. He was suspended again, then allowed to do a comedy, &quot;The Lady&#x27;s from Kentucky&quot; (1939). In January 1939, he refused to make &quot;The Magnificent Fraud&quot; and was again replaced by Nolan. Raft&#x27;s contract was meant to last until February of that year, but Paramount ended it prematurely.

===Warner Bros: 1939–1943===

Raft received an offer from Warner Bros. to appear opposite James Cagney in a prison film titled &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot; (1939); the film was a great success and Warner Bros. offered Raft a long-term contract in July 1939 at three films per year. He next appeared in &quot;I Stole a Million&quot; (1939) for Universal.

Hal Wallis later wrote that &quot;Our association with Raft was a constant struggle from start to finish. Hypersensitive to public accusations of underworld connections, he flatly refused to play the heavy in any film... Time and time again we offered him gangster parts and time and time again he turned them down.&quot;

Raft was slated to appear in a remake of &quot;The Patent Leather Kid&quot;, one of his favorite films, and a John Dillinger film with Cagney, but both projects were canceled. He was assigned to &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot; (1939) with William Holden, Jane Bryan and Humphrey Bogart. Raft was borrowed by Walter Wanger to play a gangster in &quot;The House Across the Bay&quot; (1940), which was a flop. He was cast in &quot;City for Conquest&quot; (1940), but declined the role and was replaced by Anthony Quinn.

Raft was scheduled to appear in &quot;Star of Africa&quot; and declined a role in &quot;The Dealer&#x27;s Name Was George,&quot; but neither film was made.

In Raoul Walsh&#x27;s trucking melodrama &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940), Raft played the lead, with Ann Sheridan as Raft&#x27;s leading lady, Humphrey Bogart in a supporting role as his brother, and Ida Lupino as a ravishing young beauty relentlessly pursuing Raft. In July 1940, Raft reprised his vaudeville act.

In August 1940, Raft declined the lead role in &quot;South of Suez&quot; (1940) and was replaced by George Brent. He was again placed on suspension, but was intended to appear in &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941) after the suspension period. However, Raft did not like the role and was suspended again, with John Garfield taking his place. MGM intended to borrow Raft to costar with Norma Shearer in &quot;The World We Make&quot;, but the film was never made.

Raft also declined the leads in &quot;High Sierra&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), and both roles were played by Bogart, catapulting Bogart&#x27;s career. Raft instead made &quot;Manpower&quot; (1941) with Edward G. Robinson and Marlene Dietrich. Robinson recalled Raft as &quot;touchy, difficult and thoroughly impossible to play with.&quot; During filming, Raft and Robinson came to blows, with photographs splashed across newspapers.

Raft next rejected the lead role in &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1942), refusing to appear on the first day of filming because he did not want to play a heel, and Bogart once again replaced him. Raft was unable to accept Fox&#x27;s offer to appear in &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot; (1942).

Raft wanted to appear in Universal&#x27;s film version of the musical &quot;Broadway&quot; (1942), but Jack Warner refused to loan him, so Raft spent eight months on suspension without pay. However, Warner Bros. could only maintain the suspension while making films that Raft declined, and the studio eventually ran out of such films, forcing them to resume paying him, and they eventually agreed to let him make &quot;Broadway&quot;, playing a fictionalized version of himself as a young dancer named George Raft.

Raft said that he paid $27,500 of his own money so that Warner Bros. could borrow Robert Cummings from Universal for another film. Raft was reported to have turned down Bogart&#x27;s role in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), although according to some Warner Bros. memos, this story is apocryphal. Raft was discussed as a possibility for the lead at one stage, as was Ronald Reagan, but was never offered it.

Raft was one of many Warner Bros. stars who appeared in United Artists&#x27; &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943). He finally returned to filming at Warner Bros. with the espionage thriller &quot;Background to Danger&quot; (1943), a film intended to capitalize on the success of &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In November 1942, Raft bought himself out of his Warner Bros. contract in order to appear in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, a story of his life, on stage, but the play never materialized.

===Freelance star and producer===
Raft&#x27;s career as a freelance actor initially began well. He toured the U.S., England and Africa performing for the troops from January through March 1944. In March 1943, he was voted the sixth-most-popular star among African-American movie audiences; &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Raft has always been a prime favorite with the Negro filmgoer.&quot; His price as a guest star on radio was $1,500-$2,500.

Raft declined the lead role in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944). Wilder later said &quot;We knew then that we&#x27;d have a good picture&quot; and Raft later admitted that &quot;I wasn&#x27;t very intelligent then.&quot; Raft&#x27;s first film after leaving Warner Bros. was the 1944 Universal musical &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1944), which featured a number of Universal&#x27;s stars in a guest spots and Raft in the lead. It achieved a healthy gross. 20th Century Fox hired him to a contract so that he could appear in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s hit musical &quot;Nob Hill&quot; (1945), replacing Fred MacMurray.

===Edwin Marin===

Raft next appeared in director Edwin Marin&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Angel&quot; (1945) for RKO, an unexpected hit that realized a profit of more than a million dollars. He next appeared in the popular &quot;Whistle Stop&quot; (1946), a United Artists melodrama that offered a good early role to Ava Gardner. &quot;Mr. Ace&quot; (1946), with Sylvia Sidney and director Marin for producer Benedict Bogeaus, was a flop, but it did lead to a rather successful radio series starring Raft entitled &quot;The Cases of Mr. Ace&quot; (1947).

In 1946, Raft earned a reported $108,000 for the year. He created his own production company, Star Films, with Sam Bischoff as president, and planned to make three films in two years for $3.5 million. He and Marin returned to RKO to make the popular film noir &quot;Nocturne&quot; (1946), produced by Joan Harrison.

Raft&#x27;s next three films were all directed by Marin: &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1947) at United Artists for Bogeaus, a box-office disappointment, &quot;Intrigue&quot; (1947) at United Artists for Star Films and &quot;Race Street&quot; (1948) at RKO.

In June 1947, Raft received bad publicity when his friend, the Las Vegas mobster Bugsy Siegel, was murdered. However, the following year, Hedda Hopper wrote that Raft was &quot;going stronger than ever today&quot; adding that &quot;he has made millions, but hasn&#x27;t got &#x27;em due to a fondness for gambling and a loyalty to helping old friends.&quot;

===Decline as a star===
Star Film&#x27;s second film was &quot;Outpost in Morocco&quot; (1949), a story of the French Foreign Legion partly shot on location in Africa that was a box-office disappointment. Raft followed this with a series of thrillers: &quot;Johnny Allegro&quot; (1949), directed by Ted Tetzlaff for Columbia, &quot;Red Light&quot; (1949), by Roy Del Ruth for United Artists and &quot;A Dangerous Profession&quot; (1949) by Tetzlaff for RKO. None of these performed strongly at the box office, and Raft&#x27;s standing as a box-office attraction had been damaged. The lengthy period of shooting for &quot;Johnny Allegro&quot; caused him to miss the chance to star in &quot;The Big Steal&quot; (1949), and he was replaced by Robert Mitchum.

Raft went to England to make &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You for This&quot;, which was filmed in 1950 but not released for another year. In the summer of 1951, Raft took the title role in the radio adventure series &quot;Rocky Jordan&quot;, playing &quot;the owner of a cabaret in Cairo whose life is steeped in intrigue.&quot; However, it only lasted a few months.

====Three films for Lippert Pictures====
Raft appeared in two Lippert Pictures low-budget thrillers, &quot;Escape Route&quot; (1952), shot in England with Sally Gray, and &quot;Loan Shark&quot; (1952).

He starred in a syndicated television series titled &quot;I&#x27;m the Law&quot; (1953) that ran for one season. &quot;The Man from Cairo&quot; (1953), also for Lippert and shot in Europe and Africa, was Raft&#x27;s last film with top billing. He resumed his dancing career, including an exhibition in Las Vegas. &quot;As far as films are concerned, I&#x27;m dead,&quot; he said, &quot;Nobody has been breaking their necks trying to hire me.&quot; He tried to persuade Darryl Zanuck to remake &quot;The Honor System&quot;. He said: &quot;I want to play heavies again. I think I made a mistake going straight.&quot;

===Supporting actor===
Raft took an excellent role as a mob boss supporting Robert Taylor in &quot;Rogue Cop&quot; (1954), a hit for MGM. Also popular was &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1954), a film noir with Ginger Rogers, but &quot;A Bullet for Joey&quot; (1955), which reunited Raft with Edward G. Robinson, was a flop.

Raft was one of many guest stars in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), and after the film&#x27;s release, he said that &quot;the telephone just seemed to stop ringing.&quot; He decided to seek other work.

===Television===
In 1953 Raft appeared as NYPD detective Lt. George Kirby on 27 episodes of &quot;I’m the Law&quot;, a police drama series. He spoofed his tough-guy image in a comedy sketch on the Feb. 20, 1955 episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. He appeared in 3 episodes of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, portraying gangster-types in comedy skits. In 1964 he performed a tango dance with the Hugh Lambert dancers to the song &quot;La Cumparsita&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1967 he did an episode of the &quot;Batman (TV series)&quot;, &quot;“Black Widow Strikes Again”&quot;. In 1971 he twice appeared on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin’s Laugh-In&quot; comedy show, and in one episode of the sitcom &quot;The Chicago Teddy Bears&quot;, which was his last TV acting role.

==Later career==
===Casinos===
In 1955, Raft was offered the chance to buy a 2% share in the Flamingo Hotel for $65,000 if he would act as its entertainment director. Raft agreed, but was rejected for a gaming license because of his alleged associations with underworld figures. He appealed, arguing that although he knew many gangsters, &quot;I never did business with any of them,&quot; and the decision was overturned in December 1955. Raft worked at the hotel negotiating its showbusiness deals.

Raft was hired by Santo Trafficante, Jr. to work as a greeter at the Capri Casino in Havana, Cuba, at which he was also a part owner. However, Fidel Castro took command of the country and closed all of its casinos, and Raft was in Havana on the night when the rebels arrived.

===Return to filmmaking===
In July 1958, Raft was offered a role in his first film in four years, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), playing a gangster. Because of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s tardiness on set, the job turned into 16 weeks of work before Raft was able to appear in &quot;Jet Over the Atlantic&quot; (1959). The success of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; did not lead to a comeback, but Raft subsequently appeared as a casino owner in the Rat Pack movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), and he appeared in a cameo role as himself in &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (1961). In Britain, he appeared in &quot;Two Guys Abroad&quot; (1962), a film intended as a pilot for a television series, and back in Hollywood had small roles in &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; and &quot;The Patsy&quot; (both 1964).

In 1965, Raft was convicted of income-tax evasion. He pleaded guilty to one count and was fined $2,500. The following year, he testified in front of a New York grand jury about organized-crime financial transactions.

===London===
Raft received an offer from Andy Neatrour to work as a host and part owner of a gambling club in London called the Colony Club. He went to London in 1966, and while there, he took parts in several films, including a cameo role in the 1967 James Bond spoof &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the French film &quot;The Upper Hand&quot; (1966) with Jean Gabin and &quot;Five Golden Dragons&quot; (1967). Although the gambling club was successful, after having returned from the U.S. in 1967 for a trip home, Raft was banned from reentering the UK as an &quot;undesirable.&quot;

Raft&#x27;s later films included &quot;Skidoo&quot; and &quot;Madigan&#x27;s Millions&quot; (both 1968). However, Raft became ill during the making of &quot;Madigan&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and he was replaced by Cesar Romero in the title role. None of Raft&#x27;s scenes remain in the film.

In the early 1970s, Raft appeared in an Alka-Seltzer television commercial as a prison inmate, worked as a goodwill ambassador for the Riviera in Las Vegas and sold his house to move into an apartment in Century City.

Raft&#x27;s final film appearances were in &quot;Hammersmith Is Out&quot; (1972), &quot;Sextette&quot; (1978), in which he reunited with Mae West, and &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face&quot; (1980), a nod to 1940s detective films. He also cohosted an episode of &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; in 1980.

Raft was a stockholder in the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation, a hotel and casino company that owned the Flamingo Las Vegas.

==Controversies==
===Links to criminal figures===
When James Cagney became president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term, he took a role in the guild&#x27;s fight against the Mafia, which had taken an active interest in the movie industry. Cagney&#x27;s wife Billie once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead. Cagney alleged that, having failed to scare him, the mob sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light on his head. On hearing about the rumor of the hit, George Raft allegedly made a call to have the hit cancelled.

Raft was interviewed by FBI agents in 1938 and 1953. The 1938 interview was about his knowledge of Louis Buchalter and Jacob Shapiro.

Raft was investigated for alleged tax evasion in 1942.

In 1944, he gave evidence when Bugsy Siegel was on trial for bookmaking.

In 1946, Raft was sued by an attorney in Australia for assault.

In 1957, Mickey Cohen said that he wanted Raft to play him in any film about his life because &quot;the others would portray me as a vicious gangster, but George would not.&quot;

In 1967, Raft was denied entry into the UK, where he had been installed as casino director at the Colony Club, because of his alleged underworld associations.

==Personal life==
Raft married Grace Mulrooney (1902–1970) in 1923, long before his stardom. The pair separated soon thereafter, but the devoutly Catholic Mulrooney refused to grant a divorce, and Raft officially remained married to her and continued to support her until her death in 1970. A romantic figure in Hollywood, Raft had love affairs with Hilda Ferguson, Betty Grable, Marlene Dietrich, Tallulah Bankhead, Carole Lombard and Mae West. He stated publicly that he wanted to marry Norma Shearer, with whom he had a long romance, but his wife&#x27;s refusal to allow a divorce eventually caused Shearer to end the affair.

===Death===
Raft died from emphysema at the age of 79 in Los Angeles on November 24, 1980. Raft left behind no will, and his estate consisted of only a $10,000 insurance policy and some furniture. In the last years of his life, he had lived on approximately $800 a month, a combination of social security and his pension. He was interred at the Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. Raft&#x27;s personal effects and wardrobe were sold through a classified advertisement listing the lot for $800 in &quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot; in the fall of 1981.

==Legacy==
Raft has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: for movies at 6150 Hollywood Boulevard and for television at 1500 Vine Street.

==In popular culture==
Ray Danton played Raft in &quot;The George Raft Story&quot; (1961), which co-starred Jayne Mansfield. Raft excoriated the film upon its release due to inaccuracies. In the 1991 biographical movie &quot;Bugsy&quot;, the character of George Raft was played by Joe Mantegna.

In season 2, episode 6 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (2000), Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano reveals to Tony that there was another uncle, the &quot;feeble-minded&quot; Ercole, who Junior describes as &quot;handsome, like George Raft&quot;.

In the Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), the character of Dixie Dwyer appears to be loosely based on Raft: in the film, the character Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins) sends Dwyer (Richard Gere) to LA to appear in films - the first of which is titled &quot;Mob Boss&quot;.

<doc id="695836" wikidata="Q7016162" url="?curid=695836" title="1993 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1993 New Zealand general election was held on 6 November 1993 to determine the composition of the 44th New Zealand Parliament. Voters elected 99 members to the House of Representatives, up from 97 members at the 1990 election. The election was held concurrently with an electoral reform referendum to replace the first-past-the-post system, with all members elected from single-member electorates, with mixed-member proportional representation. It saw the governing National Party, led by Jim Bolger, win a second term in office, despite a major swing away from National in both seats and votes, and the carrying of the referendum by 53.9% to 46.1%.

Having broken electoral campaign promises and embarked on supply-side economics and wide-sweeping cuts during his first term, Bolger led the most unpopular government since the Great Depression. The neoliberal actions of Ruth Richardson, his Minister of Finance, were termed Ruthanasia by the media, and her Mother of all Budgets in 1991 caused huge protests. By September 1991, support for National had plummeted to a hitherto unprecedented polling low of 22%. Mike Moore, ousted by Bolger in a landslide just three years before, attacked National&#x27;s caucus as dangerous right-wing extremists, and enjoyed considerable personal popularity. While the high unemployment Ruthanasia had caused had recovered somewhat by 1993, Bolger&#x27;s approval ratings remained dire against Moore up until election day.

With a vote difference of just 7,133 between the two major parties, the election was one of the closest in New Zealand history. Bolger&#x27;s 17-seat majority gained in 1990 was pared back to a bare majority of one seat. The Labour Party, led by former Prime Minister Mike Moore, enjoyed a 16-seat rise and almost won outright. The two smaller parties - Winston Peters&#x27; New Zealand First, which he formed after leaving National over conflict with their economic policy, and Jim Anderton&#x27;s Alliance of parties to the left of Labour - both outperformed expectations and won significant shares of the vote. However, the first-past-the-post system kept them from gaining more than two seats each.

If MMP had been in use, the left-wing bloc of Labour and the Alliance – having secured a larger share of the vote than National or New Zealand First – would likely have formed a government. This was the last time prior to the 2020 election where a party won an absolute majority of seats.

==Background==
Before the election, the National Party governed with 64 seats, while the opposition Labour Party held only 29. The 1990 election had been a major victory for the National Party, with the unpopular Fourth Labour Government being decisively defeated. The Labour Party had become unpopular for its ongoing economic reforms, nicknamed Rogernomics after Minister of Finance Roger Douglas, which were based around liberalisation, privatisation, and the removal of tariffs and subsidies. The National Party divided as to the merits of the reforms, with conservatives generally opposed and libertarians generally in favour. The party had fought the 1990 election saying that the Labour government&#x27;s program was too radical, and was being carried out without any thought of the social consequences – Jim Bolger spoke about &quot;the Decent Society&quot;, promising a return to a more moderate and balanced platform.

Once in government, however, the key Minister of Finance role was taken not by a moderate but by Ruth Richardson, who wished to expand, not end, the economic reforms. Upon gaining power, Richardson intensified the deregulation, creating an portfolio of neoliberal policies popularly known as Ruthanasia. Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Mother of all Budgets&quot;, released in 1991, slashed available unemployment, sickness and welfare benefits. The families benefit by $25.00 to $27.00, unemployment benefit was cut by $14.00 a week, sickness benefit by $27.04. Universal payments for family benefits were completely abolished, and user pay schemes were introduced in a libertarian fashion. The Employment Contracts Act sought to weaken trade unions, by meaning employees had to have individual contracts or be on a single-employer collective agreement. Richardson also ended free tertiary education altogether, after the Fourth Labour Government had ended bursaries.

These policies, a steep departure even from Rogernomics, led to a major backlash in multiple aspects of society, both on the left and the right. Students and trade unionists led protests and marches in Wellington and Auckland against university cuts and the Employment Contracts Bill. Many of the voters who had felt betrayed by Labour&#x27;s reforms now felt betrayed by the National Party as well. The Mother of all Budgets not only caused widespread public contempt for the National Party but also wreaked havoc internally. The budget was lamented by the conservative wing of the National Party; former Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon resigned from his Tamaki electorate in protest of Richardson&#x27;s policies, triggering a by-election. Polling declined massively for National, and Mike Moore shot up in approval ratings while attacking National&#x27;s caucus as right-wing extremists. According to an episode of &quot;Frontline&quot; on TVNZ 1 that aired less than two weeks before the election, Bolger led the most unpopular government since the Great Depression. By September 1991, support for National had plummeted to a hitherto unprecedented polling low of 22%.

The Alliance, the largest &quot;third party&quot;, was a broad coalition of five smaller groups – the NewLabour Party (a Labour splinter), the Democrats (a social credit party), the Greens (an environmentalist party), Mana Motuhake (a Māori party), and the Liberal Party (a National splinter). The Alliance held three seats in Parliament – one belonged to Jim Anderton, who had been re-elected under a NewLabour banner in the seat he had formerly held for Labour, while the other two belonged to the National MPs who formed the Liberal Party. In its first electoral test, the 1992 by-election in Tamaki, the Alliance had performed well, taking second place. Another smaller group was New Zealand First, a party established by former National MP Winston Peters. Peters had broken with his party after a number of policy disputes with its leadership, and resigned from parliament to contest his seat as an independent. After being overwhelmingly re-elected, Peters established New Zealand First to promote his views. Peters was the party&#x27;s sole MP.

Another consequence of dissatisfaction with both major parties was the referendum conducted alongside the 1993 election. The culmination of the larger decade-long New Zealand electoral reform process, the referendum was held following the September 1992 indicative referendum, which saw 85% of voters voting for change from the existing First Past The Post (FPP) system, and 70% choosing the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) as its preferred replacement: a proportional system which would make it easier for smaller parties to win seats. It asked voters to choose whether to keep the existing FPP system or change to MMP, with 53.9% of voters opting to change to MMP.

While National and Labour usually stood candidates in every seat, National was one candidate short as their Southern Maori candidate apparently did not apply in time.

===MPs retiring in 1993===
Four MPs, including three National MPs and one Labour MP, intended to retire at the end of the 43rd Parliament.

==The election==
The election was held on 6 November. 2,321,664 people were registered to vote, and 85.2% turned out. This turnout was almost exactly the same as for the previous election, although slightly less than what would be seen for the following one.

==Summary of results==
With a vote difference of just 7,133 between the two major parties, the election was one of the closest in New Zealand history. Preliminary results based on election night counts saw the country facing its first hung parliament since 1931, with no party gaining the 50 seats required for a majority. The National Party won 49 seats, a drop of 15 from before the election, and Labour had won 46 seats, with the balance of power held with the Alliance and New Zealand First, which won two seats each. This led to Jim Bolger saying on public television, &quot;Bugger the pollsters&quot;, as polls had predicted a comfortable National victory. Bolger reacted to the election results by giving a conciliatory speech, while Labour leader Mike Moore delivered a speech later described by political scientist Jack Vowles as &quot;damaging&quot; and &quot;more appropriate for a decisive Labour win than a narrow defeat.&quot;

On election night result with the two major parties tied, the Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard asked her predecessor Sir David Beattie to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as prime minister. However National won one more seat and was returned to power when the official count saw the seat of Waitaki swing from Labour to National, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats. Labour&#x27;s Sir Peter Tapsell agreed to become speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives (so that National would not lose a vote in the house). Hence National had a majority of one seat.

The 1993–1996 parliamentary term would see a number of defections from both major parties, meaning that National would eventually be forced to make alliances to retain power.

===Summary of changes===
Based on the 1991 New Zealand census, an electoral redistribution was carried out; the last one had been carried out in 1987 based on the previous census in 1986. This resulted in the abolition of nine electorates, and the creation of eleven new electorates. Through an amendment in the Electoral Act in 1965, the number of electorates in the South Island was fixed at 25, so the new electorates increased the number of the North Island electorates by two. In the South Island, one electorate was abolished (), and one electorate was recreated (). In the North Island, five electorates were newly created (, , , , and ), five electorates were recreated (, Hauraki, , , and ), and eight electorates were abolished (, , , , , , , and ).

In many cases an MP from an abolished seat stood for, and was elected to a new one that broadly covered their previous electorate.

* A by-election to the Auckland City Council was caused after Hauraki Gulf Islands Ward councillor Sandra Lee resigned her seat after she was elected MP for , necessitating a by-election to fill the council vacancy. The by-election was won by Gordon Hodson.

<text>Ransom Bird Shelden Sr. (July 7, 1814 – May 17, 1878) was the founder of Houghton, a city in the county of Houghton County, Michigan.

==Early life==
Shelden was born in Essex County, New York on July 7, 1814. Shelden&#x27;s father George Shelden was a farmer in Essex County for many years. In 1832, Ransom Shelden moved to Chicago, building the first hotel in what was then known as &quot;Fort Dearborn.&quot; However, he soon moved again to a farm near Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

Shelden married Theresa M. Douglas, also of Essex County, in 1839. She was a cousin of Douglass Houghton. The couple had four sons: Carlos D. Shelden, George C. Shelden, Christine M. Shelden, and Ransom B. Shelden Jr.

==Houghton==
In 1847, Shelden moved to Portage Entry in the Keweenaw Peninsula with his brother-in-law and began trading and fishing. Four years later they moved to the Quincy Mine and opened a mine store. Around the same time, Sheldon bought land on the south side of Portage Lake, and in 1852 moved his store there.

Shelden and his brother-in-law had also been purchasing swaths of land throughout the Upper Peninsula, and by 1852 owned around 55,000 acres. Shelden invested in copper mines, lumber yards, and real estate, as well as iron mines in Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls and platted the village of Houghton. In about 1862, Shelden built Pewabic House, the oldest still-extant building in Hancock, Michigan.
In 1871 Shelden was elected as president of the town, a position he held for seven years until his death on May 17, 1878. The main street of Houghton, variously called &quot;Sheldon Street,&quot; (inaccurately) &quot;Shelden Avenue&quot; and &quot;Sheldon Avenue,&quot; was named in Shelden&#x27;s honour, as was the &quot;Sheldon Center&quot;.

<doc id="695839" wikidata="Q1072872" url="?curid=695839" title="Burton Malkiel">
<text>Burton Gordon Malkiel (born August 28, 1932) is an American economist, financial executive, and writer most noted for his classic finance book &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; (first published 1973, in its 13th edition as of 2023). 

Malkiel is the Chemical Bank chairman&#x27;s professor of economics at Princeton University, and is a two-time chairman of the economics department there. He was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers (1975–1977), president of the American Finance Association (1978), and dean of the Yale School of Management (1981–1988). He also spent 28 years as a director of the Vanguard Group. He is Chief Investment Officer of software-based financial advisor, Wealthfront Inc. and as a member of the Investment Advisory Board for Rebalance. Malkiel was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001.

He is a leading proponent of the efficient-market hypothesis, which contends that prices of publicly traded assets reflect all publicly available information, although he has also pointed out that some markets are evidently inefficient, exhibiting signs of non-random walk. Malkiel in general supports buying and holding index funds as the most effective portfolio-management strategy, but does think it is viable to actively manage &quot;around the edges&quot; of such a portfolio, as financial markets are not totally efficient. In a 2020 interview, Malkiel also stated he was not opposed in principle to investing or trading in single stocks (as exemplified by the popularity of Robinhood), provided the large majority of one&#x27;s portfolio is index funds.

==Life and career==
Malkiel was born on August 28, 1932, in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1949, Malkiel graduated from Boston Latin School, and went on to receive his bachelor&#x27;s degree (1953) and his MBA (1955) from Harvard University. He originally went into the business world, but had always had an interest in academic economics and eventually earned his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1964 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Problems in the Structure of Financial Markets.&quot;

He married his first wife, Judith Atherton Malkiel, in 1954; they had one son, Jonathan. After Judith Malkiel&#x27;s death in 1987, Burton Malkiel married his second wife, Nancy Weiss, in 1988. (Nancy Weiss Malkiel was Dean of the College of Princeton University from 1987 to 2011.) He served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army from 1955 to 1958. 

Malkiel is on the advisory panel of Robert D. Arnott&#x27;s investment management firm, Research Affiliates. Malkiel&#x27;s hobbies include casino games and horse race betting, to which he applies mathematical and statistical analysis.

==Notable works==
In addition to several books, he has also written influential articles, including &quot;The Valuation of Closed-End Investment Company Shares,&quot; &quot;Journal of Finance&quot; (1977). This article discussed the puzzle of why closed-end fund companies typically trade at market valuations lower than the net value of their assets. If net asset value and market capitalization are only two ways of measuring the same thing, then why is there a consistent difference between them?

On July 22, 2005, Malkiel retired from 28 years of service as a director of the Vanguard Group and trustee of Vanguard Mutual funds, yet remains closely affiliated with Vanguard due to Vanguard&#x27;s similar investment philosophies. In &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot;, he frequently references Vanguard.

Malkiel is also the Chief Investment Officer of Wealthfront, an automated investment and savings service founded in 2008 currently with $10 billion under management.

<text>Henry Moor (1809 – 12 May 1877) was a British lawyer and politician who served as the second Mayor of Melbourne, Australia and as Member of Parliament for Brighton in England.

==Early life==
Moor was born in Greenwich, Kent, England. He was Educated at Rev. Charles Parr Burney&#x27;s school in the town. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 12 November 1831, and from 1832 until 1841 he had a legal partnership with John Simpson at Furnival&#x27;s Inn, London.

==Melbourne 1842–1854==
In 1842 Moor emigrated to Australia, arriving in Melbourne in February. He continued his legal work, initially as a conveyancer, before being admitted as attorney, solicitor and proctor in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in April 1843. He established a successful legal practice and rose to become chief magistrate of New South Wales.

Moor was elected to Melbourne Town Council to represent Bourke Ward, and served as the town&#x27;s second mayor from 1844 to 1845. His second mayoral term followed from 1846 to 1847, with Melbourne achieving city status in the latter year. A new Anglican Diocese of Melbourne was created, and Moor was appointed first lay registrar of the diocese, a post he held until 1854.

In July 1849 Moor was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council for the Electoral district of Port Phillip. In 1851 the Port Phillip District, including Melbourne, was removed from New South Wales to become the new Colony of Victoria.

From January 1852 to December 1853 Moor was in England, and he finally returned permanently in March 1854, settling in the resort town of Brighton on the south coast.

==Brighton 1854–1877==
Moor became a well-known figure in Brighton. When one of the town&#x27;s sitting members of parliament, Admiral Sir George Brooke-Pechell, died in 1860 the local Conservative organisation nominated him as candidate in the ensuing by-election. Moor was defeated in a straight fight with the Radical candidate James White, securing 1,229 votes against White&#x27;s 1,565.

Four years later a further by-election was held when Brighton&#x27;s other MP, William Coningham, resigned. Moor was again a candidate, and although supported by the Conservative Party declared himself to be going forward on &quot;independent principles&quot; and claimed to be &quot;bound by no party and no political club&quot;. Moor described himself as a &quot;Liberal Conservative&quot; and found himself facing no fewer than three Liberal candidates and one independent. Benefitting from this split vote, Moor was duly elected with a majority of 181 votes over his nearest rival, Henry Fawcett.

His time in the House of Commons was to be brief. A general election was held in 1865, and Moor was one of three candidates seeking the two Brighton seats. The two other candidates were the sitting MP James White and his opponent of the previous year, Henry Fawcett. Moor was defeated, winning 2,134 votes with White securing 3,065 and Fawcett 2,665. He made an attempt to regain the seat at the 1868 general election, but failed to be elected, coming last of six candidates.

Moor retired from politics and continued to reside in Brighton. He died in May 1877 while visiting Teddington, Middlesex, aged 68.

<text>Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah (; 6 June 1963 – 7 August 2020) (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; Abu Mohammed al-Masri) was a high-ranking Egyptian member of al-Qaeda. He has been described as al-Qaeda&#x27;s most experienced operational planner and was said to be the second-in-command in the organization at the time of his death.

Abdullah was one of the 22 original members of the United States FBI list of Most Wanted Terrorists. The State Department, through the Rewards for Justice Program, had offered up to US$10 million for information on his location. He was wanted by the United States for his alleged role in the 1998 American embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The FBI also gave other names used by Abdullah as Abu Mariam, Mustafa Abu Mariam Khaled, Abu Mohamed Al-Masri, Azayet, and Saleh, a possible abbreviation of Saleh Gamal.

On 14 November 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Abdullah had been killed on 7 August 2020 in Tehran, Iran, by Israeli Mossad operatives at the request of the United States. On 12 January 2021, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the death of Abdullah.

==Biography==
Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah was born in the Gharbia Governorate of Egypt on 6 June 1963. According to Abdullah, he was once a professional football player for the Ghazl El-Mehalla team in Egypt. Having joined the jihadist movement during the Soviet–Afghan War, he was not allowed to return to Egypt, and remained in Afghanistan, joining Osama bin Laden.

In 1992, he helped Saif al-Adel in providing intelligence and military training to those associated with al-Qaeda in Somalia and Sudan. His trainees were among the group who fought against the Americans during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.

Between 1996 and 1998 he operated training camps in Afghanistan for al-Qaeda. Abdullah was responsible for forging a passport for Mohammed Saddiq Odeh so he could get from Pakistan to Afghanistan and meet Osama bin Laden before the bombings of US embassies on 7 August 1998 in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others.

He fled Nairobi, Kenya, on 6 August 1998, to Karachi, Pakistan. He then travelled to Afghanistan. In 2000, Abdullah became a member of the &quot;majlis al-shura&quot;, al-Qaeda&#x27;s leadership council. A former Israeli intelligence official accused him of ordering the 2002 Mombasa attacks.

In 2003, he moved to south-east Iran where he was later detained and placed under house arrest. He was released by Iran in March 2015 with al-Qaeda leaders Saif al-Adel and Abu Khayr al-Masri in exchange for the release of Nour Ahmad Nikbakht, an Iranian diplomat who was being held in Yemen. A &quot;New York Times&quot; source said he remained in Tehran, living under the protection of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and later the Ministry of Intelligence and Security.

==Family==
Abdullah was married to a daughter of Ahmad Salama Mabruk, with whom he had three daughters. One of his daughters, named Maryam, had been married to Hamza bin Laden (son of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden). Maryam was also killed in the attack that killed Abdullah.

==Death==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 14 November 2020 that Abdullah, while driving his car in the Pasdaran neighborhood of Tehran, Iran, on 7 August 2020, was shot to death by Israeli Mossad operatives from Kidon, a unit informally known as the &quot;Tip of the Spear&quot;, on a motorcycle, at the behest of the United States. Kidon is a highly secretive unit within Mossad, the external intelligence agency of Israel. Abdullah&#x27;s daughter, who was the widow to former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden&#x27;s late son, Hamza bin Laden, was also reportedly killed in the attack. Reuters had previously received similar information from a security official in Afghanistan, but could not independently receive confirmation of the &quot;Times&quot; reporting via US or Israeli officials. Iranian news sources at the time of his death claimed the identities of the dead pair to be of a Lebanese academic by the name of &quot;Habib Dawood&quot;, who had ties to Hezbollah, and his daughter. Afghan news station Shamshad News also claimed his death.

Iran denied &quot;The New York Times&quot; report; its Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement that the United States and Israel sometimes &quot;try to tie Iran to such groups by lying and leaking false information to the media&quot;.

&quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; reported &quot;According to intelligence sources in Israel, revelation of the assassination of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Masri, is meant to convey a message to President-elect Joe Biden, who intends to renew negotiations with Iran. Israel wishes to portray Tehran as a terror incubator for the organization that was responsible for the September 11 attacks.&quot;

“This exposes the regime in Iran as one that provides a haven for the organization that&#x27;s most significant to the United States,” said a former senior defense official. &quot;It&#x27;s undeniably convenient for Iran to operate Al-Qaida against the United States because of sanctions or to exact a price for the assassination of Soleimani,” the official said,&quot;

On 12 January 2021, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed the death of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah.

<text>Dyrhólaey (, &quot;door hill island&quot;), formerly known by seamen as Cape Portland, is a small promontory located on the south coast of Iceland, not far from the village Vík. It was formerly an island of volcanic origin, which is also known by the Icelandic word &quot;eyja&quot; meaning &quot;island&quot;. The volcano erupted about 100 thousand years ago during the Pleistocene. The peninsula has an elevation of , and the Dyrhólaey Lighthouse, built in 1927, sits at the top of the formation facing the sea.

It is commonly asserted that Dyrhólaey is the most southernly point in Iceland, in fact, Kötlutangi (63°23&#x27;N, 018°45&#x27;W) on the sands to the east of Dyrhólaey, is the southernmost point of mainland Iceland. Surtsey, part of the Westman Islands archipelago is the southernmost point of the country of Iceland. 

The view from Dyrhólaey is broad: To the north is to be seen the big glacier Mýrdalsjökull. To the east, the black lava columns of the Reynisdrangar come out of the sea, and to the west the whole coastline in the direction of Selfoss is visible – depending on weather conditions. In front of the peninsula, there is a gigantic black arch of lava standing in the sea, which gave the peninsula its name (meaning: &quot;door hill island&quot;).

Access to Dyrhólaey is by a steep switchback road, which was rebuilt and paved in 2022. 

In the summertime, many Atlantic puffins can be found nesting on the cliff faces of Dyrhólaey.

In October 1993 pilot Arngrímur Jóhannsson and member of parliament Árni Johnsen became the first to fly an airplane through the Dyrhólaey arch. They conducted three pass throughs using a Bellanca 7KCAB Citabria plane, registration TF-MBL.

<text>Wall of Voodoo was an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Though largely an underground act for the majority of its existence, the band came to prominence when its 1982 single &quot;Mexican Radio&quot; became a hit on MTV and alternative radio. The band was known for surrealist lyrics drawing on iconography of the American Southwest.

==History==

===Formation===
Wall of Voodoo had its roots in Acme Soundtracks, a film score business started by Stan Ridgway, later the vocalist and harmonica player for Wall of Voodoo. Acme Soundtracks&#x27; office was across the street from the Hollywood punk club The Masque and Ridgway was soon drawn into the emerging punk/new wave scene. Marc Moreland, guitarist for the Skulls, began jamming with Ridgway at the Acme Soundtracks office and the soundtrack company morphed into a new wave band. In 1977, with the addition of Skulls members Bruce Moreland (Marc Moreland&#x27;s brother) as bassist and Chas T. Gray as keyboardist, along with Joe Nanini, who had been the drummer for the Bags, the Eyes, and Black Randy and the Metrosquad, the first lineup of the band was born, named Wall of Voodoo before their first show in reference to a comment made by Joe Berardi, a friend of Ridgway&#x27;s and member of the Fibonaccis. According to Ridgeway, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in Phil Spector and his wall-of-sound approach to recording. And Wall of Voodoo seemed to describe best what we were doing.&quot;

===1977–1983===


Wall of Voodoo released a self-titled EP in 1980 which featured a synthesizer-driven cover of &quot;Ring of Fire.&quot; The second half of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; features a dissonant guitar solo covering the theme to the 1966 film &quot;Our Man Flint.&quot; The band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Dark Continent&quot;, followed in 1981. Much of the material from this record would feature in live shows over the next few years, such as &quot;Red Light&quot;, &quot;Animal Day&quot; and fan favorite &quot;Back in Flesh&quot;. Bruce Moreland left the band for the first time soon after this, and Chas Gray performed both bass and synthesizers during this time. The band recorded their biggest-selling album, &quot;Call of the West&quot;, in 1982. A single, &quot;Mexican Radio,&quot; about border blaster radio stations, became an international hit, peaking at No. 18 in Canada, No. 21 in New Zealand and No. 33 in Australia. It also reached No. 64 in the UK, and was their only Top 100 hit in the United States. As well, the video received considerable exposure on the newly formed MTV.

Bill Noland was added as a keyboardist soon after the release of &quot;Call of the West&quot;. That same year, Wall of Voodoo opened for the Residents on the cult band&#x27;s inaugural tour, &quot;the Mole Show,&quot; at Perkins Palace in Pasadena, Halloween 1982, and for Devo&#x27;s ill-fated televised 3-DEVO Concert in October.

Wall of Voodoo opened for Oingo Boingo on their &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; tour at the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara in March 1983. Stan Ridgway claims that the situation around the band was increasingly chaotic during this era, with a great deal of drug use and out-of-control behavior on the part of the band members, as well as shady behavior by the band&#x27;s management and record label. Wall of Voodoo appeared at the second US Festival on May 28, 1983 (the largest concert the band had performed), immediately after which Ridgway, Nanini, and Noland all left the band. Stan Ridgway soon went on to a successful solo career. He appeared as a guest vocalist on a track on the &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; score and released his critically acclaimed debut solo album &quot;The Big Heat,&quot; which included the single &quot;Camouflage&quot;, a top ten hit across Europe, in 1986. Joe Nanini soon resurfaced in the country rock band Lonesome Strangers.

===1983–1989===
The remainder of the band, Marc Moreland, Chas T. Gray and a returning Bruce Moreland, carried on under the name Wall of Voodoo. Soon after, Andy Prieboy, formerly of the San Francisco new wave band Eye Protection, joined as singer and Ned Leukhardt was added as drummer. They issued a UK-only single &quot;Big City&quot; in 1984, and contributed a track to the film &quot;Weird Science&quot; in 1985. Later that year, they released &quot;Seven Days in Sammystown&quot;. The first single, &quot;Far Side of Crazy&quot;, did well in Australia, reaching number 23 on the ARIA charts. The song is still heard today on the Austereo Triple M network.

In 1987, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Happy Planet&quot;. The album, their second with Andy Prieboy as frontman, saw &quot;Call of the West&quot;&#x27;s Richard Mazda returning as producer. &quot;Happy Planet&quot; spawned another hit in Australia: a cover of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Do It Again,&quot; which charted at No. 40 there. The video for the song featured the Beach Boys&#x27; own Brian Wilson. Bruce Moreland left the band prior to the subsequent tour. In 1989, Wall of Voodoo split up and Andy Prieboy and Marc Moreland went on to solo careers.

===Post-breakup===
In 1989, a post-breakup live album entitled &quot;The Ugly Americans in Australia&quot; was issued, which documented their 1987 tour of Melbourne, Australia. (Additional performances from a date in Bullhead City, Arizona, were also included.) Stan Ridgway, Andy Prieboy and Marc Moreland all embarked on solo careers throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Joe Nanini released an EP under the name Sienna Nanini in 1996.

Two former members died in the early 2000s: Joe Nanini suffered a brain hemorrhage on December 4, 2000, and Marc Moreland died of kidney and liver failure on March 13, 2002.

On July 18, 2006, a Stan Ridgway-fronted Wall of Voodoo performed at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Orange County as an opening band for Cyndi Lauper. However, other than Ridgway, none of the surviving Wall of Voodoo members were included in this lineup: Joe Berardi and Voodoo producer Richard Mazda performed instead. Ridgway&#x27;s album &quot;Snakebite: Blacktop Ballads and Fugitive Songs&quot; (2005), features the narrative song, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Wall of Voodoo Blues Pt. 1,&quot; a history of the band in song.

A remastered coupling of &quot;Dark Continent&quot; and &quot;Call of the West&quot; was released by Raven Records on November 10, 2009. On October 2, 2012, Raven issued a companion two-disc set containing all three albums from the Andy Prieboy era (&quot;Seven Days in Sammystown&quot;, &quot;Happy Planet&quot; and &quot;Ugly Americans in Australia&quot;), all remastered, including three bonus tracks.

In 2015 Andy Prieboy stated: &quot;We won’t do a Voodoo reunion without Marc. So until he shows up, sorry, no reunion.&quot;

In late 2023 Andy Prieboy and Chas T. Gray launched a website under the name &quot;Wall of Voodoo 2&quot;, announcing the upcoming release of recently rediscovered and previously unreleased recordings. These recordings consisted of live recordings, master tracks as well as demos dating back to 1983 when the group consisted of only Gray and Marc Moreland. The first set of recordings, &quot;The Lost Tapes Vol. 1&quot;, was released on November 25, 2023 and featured 11 tracks recorded live during their &quot;Happy Planet&quot; tour sometime in 1987. &quot;Museums: The Lost Tapes Vol. 2&quot; was released on March 15, 2024, and contained 12 demos recorded by Gray and Moreland (as &quot;International Voodoo&quot;) sometime after the 1983 US Festival performance. Roughly half of these tracks never made it on any album, the other half consisting of &quot;Big City&quot; and three versions of &quot;Museums&quot; from &quot;Seven Days in Sammystown&quot; and three versions of &quot;Deep in the Jungle&quot; (from the &quot;Weird Science&quot; soundtrack).

==Musical style==

According to &quot;Popdose&quot;, the band&#x27;s sound was shaped by merging Stan Ridgway&#x27;s &quot;love of bebop and country music&quot; with Marc Moreland&#x27;s &quot;affection for electronic pioneers such as Kraftwerk&quot;. According to &quot;AllMusic&quot; biographer Jason Ankeny, the band&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;cinematic narratives -- heavily influenced by Westerns and film noir&quot;. Ridgway&#x27;s vocal style has been described as having a &quot;droll, narcoleptic manner&quot; and the band&#x27;s music as &quot;atonal, electronically based&quot;. According to &quot;NPR&quot;, the band &quot;weaved [cultural references] like noir [and] Spaghetti Western&quot; with music that was a &quot;tip-of-the-hat to Ennio Morricone&quot;. According to &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Wall of Voodoo was &quot;Poised uneasily between machine music and rock’n’roll&quot; and the band &quot;embodied the conflict between old and new for the serious-minded: classy Halloween music that’s scary, but pleasantly so.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine described Wall of Voodoo as combining &quot;western
Americana motifs with angular
art-rock to delicious effect. It
was as if stream-of-conscious
cowboy movies were being scored by a triumvirate of Sparks, Devo and Talking Heads.&quot; Ridgway said, regarding the band&#x27;s style, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in Phil Spector and his wall-of-sound approach to recording. [The name] Wall of Voodoo seemed to describe best what we were doing.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Wall of Voodoo as a post-punk band. Reviewer Mark Deming called Wall of Voodoo a new wave band.

<text>George Brent (born George Brendan Nolan; 15 March 1904 – 26 May 1979) was an Irish-American stage, film, and television actor. He is best remembered for the eleven films he made with Bette Davis, which included &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;Dark Victory&quot;.

==Early life==
Brent was born in Ballinasloe, County Galway, Ireland on March 15, 1904, to John J. and Mary (née McGuinness) Nolan. His father was a shopkeeper and his mother was a native of Clonfad, Moore, County Roscommon. In September 1915, he moved with his younger sister Kathleen to New York City. There, they joined their mother, who was living in the US after her separation from her husband.

Brent returned to Ireland in February 1921, during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1922), and was involved in the Irish Republican Army. During this period he also became involved with the Abbey Theatre.

He fled Ireland with a bounty set on his head by the British government, although he later claimed only to have been a courier for guerrilla leader and tactician Michael Collins. According to &quot;Ballinasloe Life&quot; (volume 2, issue 4, Oct/Nov 2012), the Irish War of Independence careers of three different men named George Nolan (Brent and two others; one from County Dublin and the other from County Offaly) were apparently conflated, which may explain some of the discrepancies regarding Brent&#x27;s year of birth, life, and activities during the 1919 to 1922 period.

==Career==
===American stage career===
Brent travelled from England to Canada and returned to the United States in August 1921.

He decided to become a professional actor. He made his Broadway debut in director Guthrie McClintic’s &quot;The Dover Road&quot;. He did numerous plays throughout the 1920s, including running several of his own stock companies. He appeared in productions of &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; (on tour for two years), &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, &quot;Up in Mabel&#x27;s Room&quot;, &quot;Elmer the Great&quot;, &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, &quot;White Cargo&quot; and &quot;Lilac Time&quot;. He acted in stock companies at Elitch Theatre, in Denver, Colorado (1929), as well as Rhode Island, Florida, and Massachusetts. In 1930, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;Love, Honor, and Betray&quot;, alongside Clark Gable.

===Early films: Fox and Universal===
Brent moved to Hollywood and made his first film for 20th Century Fox, &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; (1930). He continued in supporting roles for Fox in &quot;Once a Sinner&quot; (1931), &quot;Fair Warning&quot; (1931), and &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot; (1931).

At Universal he was seventh-billed for &quot;Ex-Bad Boy&quot; (1931) and fifth for &quot;The Homicide Squad&quot; (1931), then was in the Rin Tin Tin serial &quot;The Lightning Warrior&quot; (1931) at Mascot Pictures.

===Warner Bros.===
Brent was signed by Warner Bros. in 1931, where he played Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s leading man in &quot;So Big!&quot; (1932), establishing him as a leading man. Bette Davis had a small role.

Brent appeared in &quot;The Rich Are Always with Us&quot; (1932) with Ruth Chatterton (who became his second wife that year), in which Davis again had a supporting role.

It was followed by &quot;Week-End Marriage&quot; (1932) with Loretta Young, &quot;The Purchase Price&quot; (1932) with Stanwyck, &quot;Miss Pinkerton&quot; (1932) with Joan Blondell, &quot;The Crash&quot; (1932) with Chatterton, and &quot;They Call It Sin&quot; (1932) with Young.

Paramount borrowed Brent for the leading-man role in &quot;Luxury Liner&quot; (1933). Back at Warners, he was one of several studio names in &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933), playing the lover of Bebe Daniels.

He returned to supporting female stars: Kay Francis in &quot;The Keyhole&quot; (1933), Chatterton in both &quot;Lilly Turner&quot; (1933) and &quot;Female&quot; (1933), and Stanwyck in &quot;Baby Face&quot; (1933).

In October 1933, he and Chatterton refused to make a film they had been assigned, &quot;Mandalay,&quot; and were replaced by Lyle Talbot and Kay Francis. Brent&#x27;s salary was then $1,000 a week.

He was top-billed in &quot;From Headquarters&quot; (1933) with Margaret Lindsay; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer borrowed him to play Myrna Loy&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Stamboul Quest&quot; (1934). In September 1934, Chatteron filed for divorce.

===Notable roles===
Brent was top billed in &quot;Housewife&quot; (1934) with Bette Davis, who was his co star. He was leading man to Jean Muir in &quot;Desirable&quot; (1935) then MGM used him for &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (1934) with Greta Garbo.

Brent supported Josephine Hutchinson in &quot;The Right to Live&quot; (1935), Francis in &quot;Living on Velvet&quot; (1935) and &quot;Stranded&quot; (1935). He then made two films with Davis, where she was top billed: &quot;Front Page Woman&quot; (1935) and &quot;Special Agent&quot; (1935).

At Warners he was top billed in the comedy &quot;Snowed Under&quot; (1936), then Walter Wanger borrowed him to play Madeleine Carroll&#x27;s leading man in &quot;The Case Against Mrs. Ames&quot; (1936).

At Warners he was reunited with Davis in &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; (1936) and Francis in &quot;Give Me Your Heart&quot; (1936). Columbia borrowed him to support Jean Arthur in &quot;More Than a Secretary&quot; (1936) then Warners gave him top billing in &quot;God&#x27;s Country and the Woman&quot; (1936) with Margaret Lindsay.

Brent made &quot;Mountain Justice&quot; (1937) with Hutchinson and &quot;The Go Getter&quot; (1937) with Anita Louise. Warners then put Brent in his first male-orientated movie: &quot;Submarine D-1&quot; (1937) with Pat O&#x27;Brien and Wayne Morris. In November 1937 he became an American citizen.

Brent made &quot;Gold Is Where You Find It&quot; (1938) with Olivia de Havilland, then made &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938) with Davis - only he was the second male lead, with Henry Fonda playing Davis&#x27; main love interest.

Warners put him in an action &quot;B&quot; film with Humphrey Bogart, &quot;Racket Busters&quot; (1938) then he was reunited with Francis in &quot;Secrets of an Actress&quot; (1938). He was in the military drama &quot;Wings of the Navy&quot; (1939) with de Havilland and John Payne.

He appeared in &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939) with Davis, which was a huge success. So too was &quot;The Old Maid&quot; (1939) where Davis and Miriam Hopkins fought over Brent. Both films were directed by Edmund Goulding.

20th Century Fox borrowed Brent for a key support role in &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939). At Warners he supported James Cagney and O&#x27;Brien in &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot; (1940).

Paramount borrowed him for &quot;Adventure in Diamonds&quot; (1940), where he had top billing over Isa Miranda. He was Merle Oberon&#x27;s leading man in &quot;&#x27;Til We Meet Again&quot; (1940), then starred in &quot;The Man Who Talked Too Much&quot; (1940) and &quot;South of Suez&quot; (1940). He supported Ann Sheridan in &quot;Honeymoon for Three&quot; (1941) and Davis in &quot;The Great Lie&quot; (1941).

Columbia borrowed him for the lead role in &quot;They Dare Not Love&quot; (1941) with Martha Scott and Edward Small used him in two films, &quot;International Lady&quot; (1941) with Ilona Massey and &quot;Twin Beds&quot; (1942) with Joan Bennett.

Brent made one final film with Davis, &quot;In This Our Life&quot; (1942), alongside de Havilland. He supported Stanwyck in &quot;The Gay Sisters&quot; (1942) and was top-billed in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Escape Forever&quot; (1942) with Brenda Marshall and &quot;Silver Queen&quot; (1942) with Priscilla Lane.

===Military service===
In 1942, Brent, an accomplished pilot who had tried and, because of age, failed to enlist in the armed services, temporarily retired from films to teach flying as a civilian flight instructor with the Civilian Pilot Training Program, and later became a pilot in the US Coast Guard for the duration of the war.

His final film for Warner Bros. was &quot;My Reputation&quot; his fifth and last film with Barbara Stanwyck, filmed from November 1943 to January 1944; except for previews for military audiences, it was not released until 1946. Brent acted on radio during this period.

===Freelance actor===
While Brent returned to his acting career after WWII, he never recaptured his former popularity but during the immediate post war period he still remained a star of big budget films. RKO used him as Hedy Lamarr&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Experiment Perilous&quot; (1944). For Hal Wallis he did &quot;The Affairs of Susan&quot; (1945) with Joan Fontaine then &quot;Tomorrow Is Forever&quot; (1946) at International with Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles.

He returned to RKO for &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946), a huge success. At Universal he was teamed with Lucille Ball in &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1946), then he made &quot;Temptation&quot; (1946) with Oberon and Edward Small at International.

Brent went to Eagle Lion to make a comedy &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1947) and Columbia for &quot;The Corpse Came C.O.D.&quot; (1947) with Blondell. Universal teamed him with Yvonne De Carlo in &quot;Slave Girl&quot; (1947).

Brent was one of several names in &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1947) for Benedict Bogeaus and &quot;Luxury Liner&quot; (1948) at MGM, a remake of the 1933 film in which Brent had appeared.

He went to Republic to star in &quot;Angel on the Amazon&quot; (1948) and in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Red Canyon&quot; (1949) played the father of the star, Ann Blyth. At the same studio he was third lead in &quot;Illegal Entry&quot; (1949) then had the lead in a &quot;B&quot; &quot;The Kid from Cleveland&quot; (1949). He supported Colbert in &quot;Bride for Sale&quot; (1950) at RKO.

The budgets of Brent&#x27;s films continued to shrink. He did two for Lippert Pictures: &quot;F.B.I. Girl&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Last Page&quot; (1952), the latter shot in England with Diana Dors. There was &quot;Montana Belle&quot; (1952) with Jane Russell then two for Monogram: &quot;Tangier Incident&quot; (1953) and &quot;Mexican Manhunt&quot; (1953).

Brent moved into television in the early 1950s guest starring in &quot;The Revlon Mirror Theater&quot;, &quot;Crown Theatre with Gloria Swanson&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Stage 7&quot;, &quot;Studio 57&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; and the religion anthology series, &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

He was cast in the lead in the 1956 television series &quot;Wire Service&quot;, which ran for 39 performances.

After appearing on &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;The Chevy Mystery Show&quot;, Brent retired.

In 1978, he made one last film, &quot;Born Again&quot;.

In 1960, Brent was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with two stars. He received a motion-pictures star located at 1709 Vine Street and a second star located at 1612 Vine Street for his work in television.

==Personal life==
Brent was married five times: to Helen Louise Campbell (1925–1927), Ruth Chatterton (1932–1934), Constance Worth (1937), Ann Sheridan (1942–1943), and Janet Michaels (1947–1974). Chatterton, Worth, and Sheridan were actresses; Chatterton and Sheridan were Warner Bros. players.

His final marriage to Janet Michaels, a former model and dress designer, lasted 27 years until her death in 1974. They had two children: a daughter, Suzanne (born August 3, 1950), and a son, Barry (born November 26, 1954).

<text>Christianity Today is an evangelical Christian media magazine founded in 1956 by Billy Graham. It is published by Christianity Today International based in Carol Stream, Illinois. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calls &quot;Christianity Today&quot; &quot;evangelicalism&#x27;s flagship magazine&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes it as a &quot;mainstream evangelical magazine&quot;. On August 4, 2022, Russell D. Moore—notable for denouncing and leaving the leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention—was named the incoming &quot;Christianity Today&quot; Editor-in-Chief.

&quot;Christianity Today&quot; has a print circulation of approximately 110,000 and an online readership of 2.2 million at ChristianityToday.com. The founder, Billy Graham, stated that he wanted to &quot;plant the evangelical flag in the middle of the road, taking the conservative theological position but a definite liberal approach to social problems&quot;. Other active publications currently active within &quot;Christianity Today&quot; include: Building Church Leaders which has vocational education materials for evangelists and clergy. Church Law &amp; Tax which discusses tax compliance. ChristianBibleStudies helps with Bible studies. ChurchSalary helps churches with information on proper remuneration. Ekstasis Magazine about Christian arts and media, specifically to encourage creativity within Christian culture to enable better storytelling, worldbuilding, and cultural representation. PreachingToday is a publication specifically for those delivering sermons. SmallGroups is a leadership magazine for smaller church planting groups such as missional living, cafe churches, pub churches, or house churches.

Graham began the magazine as counterpoint to &quot;The Christian Century&quot;, the predominant independent periodical of mainline Protestantism, and as a way to bring the evangelical Christian community together.

==History==
The second issue of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; was created in the date of October 15, 1956, and the opening editorial, Why &#x27;Christianity Today&#x27;?, stated &quot;&quot;Christianity Today&quot; has its origin in a deep-felt desire to express historical Christianity to the present generation. Neglected, slighted, misrepresented—evangelical Christianity needs a clear voice, to speak with conviction and love, and to state its true position and its relevance to the world crisis. A generation has grown up unaware of the basic truths of the Christian faith taught in the Scriptures and expressed in the creeds of the historic evangelical churches.&quot;

Its first editor was Carl F. H. Henry. Notable contributors in its first two decades included F. F. Bruce, Edward John Carnell, Frank Gaebelein, Walter Martin, John Warwick Montgomery, and Harold Lindsell. Lindsell succeeded Henry as editor and during his editorial administration much attention centered on debates about biblical inerrancy. Later editorial leadership came from Kenneth Kantzer, Terry Muck, and David Neff. V. Gilbert Beers was hired as the fourth editor in 1982, reportedly to increase the magazine&#x27;s lay readership. From 2015 until January 3, 2020, Mark Galli was the editor in chief. Following Galli&#x27;s retirement Daniel M. Harrell served as editor in chief for a year. Russell Moore took the position in August 2022. The publication now includes print and online versions and various ancillary products. Print and online contents include feature stories, news ranging from cultural issues from a Christian viewpoint to the global church, opinion, reviews, and investigative reporting.

In Billy Graham&#x27;s 1997 autobiography, &quot;Just As I Am&quot;, he writes of his vision, idea, and history with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, and his early meeting with oil company executive, John Howard Pew, to establish the publication. Most critics label &quot;Christianity Today&quot; as a mainstream, intellectual, centrist evangelical publication.

===Editorials on impeachments of U.S. presidents===
On June 7, 1974, in an editorial entitled &quot;Should Nixon Resign?&quot;, published during the impeachment hearings of President Richard Nixon, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; wrote &quot;that the constitutional process should be followed, and followed with dispatch.&quot; The magazine did not call for his resignation, but instead stated that &quot;If he is acquitted, the nation will have to wait out the term of a President whose ability to function has been seriously eroded.&quot; On October 5, 1998, regarding the imminent impeachment of President Bill Clinton, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; stated in an editorial that &quot;Unsavory dealings and immoral acts by the president and those close to him&quot; have compromised his administration&#x27;s moral leadership, criticizing his televised August 17 confession as a &quot;nonapology&quot;.

In an editorial published on December 19, 2019, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, editor in chief Mark Galli asserted among other criticisms that he sought to leverage his political power &quot;to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit&quot; presidential candidate Joe Biden. He argued: &quot;That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral.&quot; The editorial received extensive media coverage and caught the attention of Trump and his allies, who in response sought to discredit the publication, with the former describing it as &quot;far-left&quot;, and almost 200 evangelical leaders rebuking it for the editorial.

=== Sexual harassment controversy ===
In 2022, the magazine published two articles announcing that a number of women reported demeaning, inappropriate, and offensive behavior by former editor in chief Mark Galli and former advertising director Olatokunbo Olawoye, whilst their behavior remained unchecked and the men were not disciplined, according to an external assessment of the ministry&#x27;s culture. Speaking to Religion News Service, Galli admitted that he may have &quot;crossed lines&quot; during his time as editor but denied having had &quot;any romantic or sexual interest in anyone at &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.&quot; In an editorial on the magazine, the CEO of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; Timothy Dalrymple admitted that the society that owns and edits the magazine fell short on protecting the employees and apologized for the fact, promising strong and swift action against sexual harassment.

==Publications==
Harold Myra, who became president and chief executive of the magazine in 1975, believed that a &quot;family&quot; of magazines would disperse overhead expenses and give more stability to the organization. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; both online and magazine is the flagship publication, fully effective in three basic areas: editorial, circulation, advertising; as such, many of the articles from their broader publications often get distributed through CT&#x27;s flagship. Christianity Today founded or acquired periodicals during the 1980s and 1990s, beginning with &quot;Leadership&quot;, a quarterly journal for clergy, in 1980.

At the ministry&#x27;s web home, ChristianityToday.org, all other brands for Christian thought leaders and church leaders are featured, including publications such as the intellectual Christian review, &quot;Books &amp; Culture&quot;, and the website for pastors and church leaders, &quot;CT Pastors&quot;. Additional web resources include &quot;Men of Integrity&quot; and &quot;Preaching Today&quot;. Many of the sections published online under the &quot;Christianity Today&quot; banner are the online legacies of defunct print publications, even named after the aforementioned publications.

==== &quot;Ekstasis&quot; (2016–present) ====
&quot;Ekstasis&quot; is a journal that was acquired by &quot;Christianity Today&quot; in 2021, originally founded in 2016 by Conor Sweetman in Toronto, Canada it focuses on Christian arts and media.

==== International editions (2007–present) ====
Besides English, it is available in 12 other languages: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Filipino, French, Galician, German, Indonesian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Their publication can be found within those linguistic regions, as well as in Japan and Israel.

==== Online presence ====
The magazine&#x27;s mission statement is to &quot;provide evangelical thought leaders a sense of community, coherence, and direction through thoughtful, biblical commentary on issues and through careful, caring reporting of the news.&quot; Its presence on the Internet began in October 1994 when it became one of the top ten content providers on all of AOL. Then, in 1996, their website was launched. Originally, it was named ChristianityOnline.com before becoming ChristianityToday.com. Today ChristianityToday.com serves as the web home for &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine, which now has distinct sections for Local Church Pastors, Reporting,
 Women, History, and Spanish readers.

Together, all Christianity Today brands reach more than 2.5 million people every month when print and digital views are combined, plus more than 5 million pageviews per month on the Internet. The ministry offers access, both premium and free, to more than 100,000 articles and other content on their various websites. They operate several stand-alone websites from ChristianityToday including SmallGroups.com, Preaching Today, Church Law &amp; Tax and many other sites.

=== Defunct ===
In 2005, Christianity Today International published 12 magazines, but following the financial downturn of 2008 it was forced to shutter several publications. By 2017 that had further diminished to three, as many of them became sections of Christianity Today proper.

==== &quot;Leadership Journal&quot; (1980–2016) ====
The first &quot;sister publication&quot; added to the Christianity Today publishing group was &quot;Leadership: A Practical Journal for Church Leaders&quot;, launched in 1980. The subtitle clearly defined the journal&#x27;s mission: it was a quarterly publication, aimed primarily at clergy and focusing on the practical concerns of ministry and church leadership. The first issue of &quot;Leadership&quot; sold out its initial press run of 50,000 copies and the publication was in the black after a single issue. The journal continued in print for 36 years. After volume 37, issue 1 (winter 2016), Christianity Today discontinued the print publication, replacing it with expanded content in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; for pastors and church leaders and occasional print supplements, as well as a new website, CTPastors.com.

==== &quot;Campus Life/Ignite Your Faith&quot; (1982–2009) ====

In 1982, Christianity Today purchased the magazine &quot;Campus Life,&quot; aimed at a high school audience, from, Campus Life Publications, Inc., a nonprofit organization, which had purchased Campus Life magazine from Youth For Christ in 1980. The name of the magazine was changed to &quot;Ignite Your Faith&quot; in 2006. It ceased publication in 2009.

==== &quot;Partnership/Marriage Partnership&quot; (1984–2009) ====
&quot;Partnership&quot; was launched in 1984 as a magazine for wives of clergy. In 1987 it was renamed &quot;Marriage Partnership&quot; and expanded its focus to marriage in general, not just clergy marriages. The magazine ceased publication in 2009.

==== &quot;Today&#x27;s Christian Woman&quot; (1985–2009) ====
&quot;Today&#x27;s Christian Woman&quot; was founded in 1978 and acquired by Christianity Today from the Fleming H. Revell Co. in 1985. It discontinued print publication in 2009 and was replaced with a &quot;digizine&quot; entitled &quot;Kyria&quot;, which was online only, but still required a paid subscription to access, although at a lower price than the print magazine. In 2012 the name of the digital publication was changed back to &quot;Today&#x27;s Christian Woman&quot;, and in 2016 it stopped being issued as a regularly scheduled digital periodical.

====&quot;Christian History&quot; (1989–2008)====

&quot;Christian History&quot; was a journal of the history of Christianity, first issued in January 1982 by the Christian History Institute. Each issue had multiple articles covering a single theme. Initially published annually, it became a quarterly publication. Christianity Today took over ownership of the magazine beginning with issue 22 in 1989. It was discontinued after the publication of issue 99 in 2008. In 2011 the Christian History Institute resumed quarterly publication of the magazine. &quot;Christian History&quot; archives still may be found on ChristianityToday.com under its special section.

==== &quot;Christian Reader/Today&#x27;s Christian&quot; (1992–2008) ====
&quot;Christian Reader&quot;, a digest magazine in the vein of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest,&quot; was founded in 1963 by the founder of Tyndale House Publishers, Ken Taylor. Christianity Today purchased the magazine in 1992. The name was changed to &quot;Today&#x27;s Christian&quot; in 2004. In 2008, Christianity Today sold the magazine to the ministry Significant Living.

====&quot;Books &amp; Culture&quot; (1995–2016)====

&quot;Books &amp; Culture&quot; was a bimonthly book review and intellectual journal modeled after the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and was published by Christianity Today International from 1995 to 2016. At the end of its publication life in 2016, the magazine&#x27;s circulation was 11,000 and its readership was 20,000. It was edited by John Wilson, and notable contributors included Mark Noll, Lauren Winner, Alan Jacobs, Jean Bethke Elshtain, and Miroslav Volf.

==== &quot;Virtue&quot; (1998–2000) ====
&quot;Virtue,&quot; a magazine for Christian women, was founded in 1978. Christianity Today purchased the publication from Cook Communications Ministries in 1998 after that publisher abruptly closed the magazine. Christianity Today revived the magazine and continued publishing it for two more years before discontinuing publication following the December/January 2000 issue.

==== &quot;Christian Parenting Today&quot; (1998–2005) ====
&quot;Christian Parenting Today&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Christian Parenting&quot;) was founded in 1989. Christianity Today purchased the magazine from Cook Communications Ministries in 1998 in the same deal in which it acquired &quot;Virtue&quot;. It ceased publication in 2005.

==== &quot;Men of Integrity&quot; (1998–2017) ====
&quot;Men of Integrity&quot; was a bi-monthly magazine for Christian men published by Christianity Today. It was created in 1998, in partnership with the evangelical men&#x27;s organization Promise Keepers. It ceased publication with the November–December 2017 issue.

<text>Bone conduction is the of sound to the inner ear primarily through the bones of the skull, allowing the hearer to perceive audio content even if the ear canal is blocked. Bone conduction transmission occurs constantly as sound waves vibrate bone, specifically the bones in the skull, although it is hard for the average individual to distinguish sound being conveyed through the bone as opposed to the sound being conveyed through the air via the ear canal. Intentional transmission of sound through bone can be used with individuals with normal hearing—as with bone-conduction headphones—or as a treatment option for certain types of hearing impairment. Bones are generally more effective at transmitting lower-frequency sounds compared to higher-frequency sounds.

Bone conduction is also called the second auditory pathway and not to be confused with cartilage conduction, which is considered the third auditory pathway.

==Overview==
Bone conduction is one reason why a person&#x27;s voice sounds different to them when it is recorded and played back. Because the skull conducts lower frequencies better than air, people perceive their own voices to be lower and fuller than others do, and a recording of one&#x27;s own voice frequently sounds higher than one expects (see voice confrontation).

Musicians may use bone conduction using a tuning fork while tuning stringed instruments. After the fork starts vibrating, placing it in the mouth with the stem between the back teeth ensures that one continues to hear the note via bone conduction, and both hands are free to do the tuning. Ludwig van Beethoven was famously rumored to be using bone conduction after losing most of his hearing, by placing one end of a rod in his mouth and resting the other end on the rim of his piano.

It has also been observed that some animals can perceive sound and even communicate by sending and receiving vibration through bone.

Comparison of hearing sensitivity through bone conduction and directly through the ear canal can aid audiologists in identifying pathologies of the middle ear—the area between the tympanic membrane (ear drum) and the cochlea (inner ear). If hearing is markedly better through bone conduction than through the ear canal (air-bone gap), problems with the ear canal (e.g. ear wax accumulation), the tympanic membrane or ossicles can be suspected. This method was first discovered by Italian physician Hieronymus Capivacci.

==Hearing aids and implants==
=== History ===
The first bone conduction hearing aids were invented in the 15th century. Italian physician Girolamo Cardano realized that when a rod was placed between someone&#x27;s teeth and attached the other end to a musical instrument, the person could hear the music despite their hearing loss. This method was used by Beethoven, as his hearing deteriorated towards the end of his life. In the 1820s, French physician Jean Marc Gaspard Itard improved on this device by attaching the other end of the rod not to a musical instrument but to the mouth of another speaker. This invention was known as the Rod of Itard. In 1923, Hugo Gernsback created a new kind of bone conduction hearing aid called the &quot;Osophone&quot;, which he later elaborated on with his &quot;Phonosone&quot;. Bone conduction hearing aids have also been fitted to glasses, which fit tightly to the side of the head.

In the 1970s, a team of doctors in Gothenburg, most notably Anders Tjellström, had the idea to implant a bone vibrator plate into the mastoid bone with an adjoining screw that allowed an external audio processor to be attached to conduct sound. The first three patients were implanted in 1977. The device gave good results and became known as a bone-anchored hearing aid, or BAHA. In 2012, this idea was taken a step further by the introduction of the BONEBRIDGE device. Whereas a BAHA implant is a percutaneous device that requires the screw abutment to protrude through the skin, the BONEBRIDGE is a transcutaneous device and is fully implanted under the skin. In this case, the audio processor is held in place by magnets.

=== Candidacy ===
Bone conduction devices are suitable for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, with a functioning cochlea but problems with the outer or inner ear that prevent sound vibrations from reaching the cochlea. This can be caused by conditions such as atresia, microtia, Goldenhar syndrome or Treacher Collins. Bone conduction is also a good option for someone who cannot use traditional air conduction hearing aids.

Bone conduction devices are also used to help people with single-sided deafness, who have a non-functioning inner ear on one side. In this situation, the device picks up sounds on the non-functioning side and sends them as vibrations through the bone to the functioning cochlea on the other side.

=== Technology ===
There are many different types of bone conduction hearing aids but most of them work on the same principle and comprise necessary components like microphones, signal processing, energy supply and a transducer that generates vibrations. The microphone of the hearing aid picks up sound signals from the environment. The signal is then optimized and transmitted to the transducer, which generates vibrations. Depending on the specific bone conduction hearing aid system, the vibrations are either sent directly through the skull bone, or through the skin towards the inner ear. Finally, the inner ear picks up the vibrations and sends them to the auditory cortex in the brain.

Different bone conduction devices contain different features. Here are the key ones.

===Surgical and non-surgical bone conduction devices===
Surgical bone conduction devices consist of an internal implant and an external audio processor used to transmit sound. They require surgery in order to implant the device, which is usually done as an outpatient procedure under general anesthetic, however this depends on the device being implanted and the health condition of the patient.

Non-surgical devices only consist of the external audio processor. The processor simply vibrates, making both the skin and the bone vibrate, conducting the vibrations through to the cochlea. Non-surgical devices are ideal for children, who may not be old enough for implantation surgery or who have temporary conductive hearing loss caused by glue ear or ear infections.

There are various ways to attach non-surgical bone conduction devices to the skin, including headbands, adhesives and bone conduction glasses. Devices include the ADHEAR from MED-EL, the BAHA Start from Cochlear, BHM&#x27;s contact mini or contact forte and the Ponto Softband from Oticon Medical. Unlike headbands or glasses-based devices, adhesive devices do not need to apply pressure against the head in order to transmit the vibration. Because of this, users of adhesive devices report wearing their device for longer each day.

===Surgical devices: percutaneous and transcutaneous devices===
A transcutaneous bone conduction device transmits sound signals, either electronic or mechanical, through the skin. In other words, there is closed, intact skin between the external audio processor and the internal implant. The processor is held in place over the implant using magnetic attraction. Transcutaneous devices currently on the market include the BAHA Attract, and Osia from Cochlear and the BONEBRIDGE from MED-EL.
With a percutaneous device, part of the implant (known as the abutment) protrudes through the skin. The audio processor then snaps onto the abutment, providing a direct connection to the implant. Percutaneous devices include the BAHA Connect from Cochlear and the Ponto from Oticon Medical.
Percutaneous devices have been associated with skin complications, ranging from slight redness to the formation of granulation tissue and recurring infection. The most serious complications might require further surgery or abutment removal and subsequent reimplantation. One study into skin problems with percutaneous implants revealed a complication rate of up to 84%. In another study a meta-analysis of complications with osseointegrated hearing aids showed that revision surgery is required in up to 34.5% of cases. Transcutaneous devices were later designed to avoid or reduce recurring skin complications.

===Surgical devices: active and passive===
An active bone conduction device is one where the implant generates the vibrations that directly stimulate the bone. With a passive bone conduction device, the vibrations are generated by the audio processor before being passed through the skin or an abutment to reach the implant and the bone. The main active bone conduction devices available are the BONEBRIDGE from MED-EL and the Osia from Cochlear. Both are active transcutaneous devices. The external audio processor picks up sound vibrations and transmits them electronically through the skin to the internal implant, which directly and actively vibrates the bone. These vibrations are conducted through the skull bone to the cochlea and are processed as normal.

The main passive bone conduction devices are the BAHA Attract and BAHA Connect from Cochlear, the Ponto from Oticon and the Alpha 2 MPO from Medtronic. The BAHA Connect and Ponto are passive percutaneous devices, whereby the audio processor is fixed onto an abutment placed through the skin. The audio processor vibrates, sending the vibrations via the abutment to the implant and then through the bone to the cochlea. The BAHA Attract and Alpha 2 are transcutaneous devices but they work in a similar way. The audio processor vibrates, sending mechanical vibrations to the implant through the bone. However, unlike with the percutaneous devices, the vibrations from the audio processor pass through the skin before they reach the internal implant. These vibrations are then conducted through the skull bones to the cochlea and are processed as normal, just like with an active device.

Active transcutaneous and passive percutaneous bone conduction devices tend to deliver better sound quality than passive transcutaneous ones. Passive transcutaneous devices send sound vibrations through the skin, and as they pass through the skin, they lose some of their strength, causing signal attenuation of up to 20dB. To counteract this, passive transcutaneous devices may require the use of strong magnets that squeeze the skin to achieve optimal conduction. This can lead to pain and irritation of the skin and soft tissue between the two magnets, and in worst cases cause necrosis. A study found that major complications—defined as complications requiring active management, such as post-operative seroma, hematoma, wound infections, skin ulcerations, and dehiscence—were found in 5.2% of cases.

===Device overview===
==Products==
Bone conduction products are usually categorized into three groups:

* Ordinary products, such as hands-free headsets or headphones
* Bone-anchored hearing aids and assistive listening devices
* Specialized communication products (e.g. for underwater or high-noise environments)

One example of a specialized communication product is a bone conduction speaker that is used by scuba divers. The device is a rubber over-moulded, piezoelectric flexing disc that is approximately across and thick. A connecting cable is molded into the disc, resulting in a tough, waterproof assembly. In use, the speaker is strapped against one of the dome-shaped bone protrusions behind the ear and the sound, which can be surprisingly clear and crisp, seems to come from inside the user&#x27;s head.

== Notable uses ==
The Google Glass device employs bone conduction technology for the relay of information to the user through a transducer that sits beside the user&#x27;s ear. The use of bone conduction means that any vocal content that is received by the Glass user is nearly inaudible to outsiders.

German broadcaster Sky Deutschland and advertising agency BBDO Germany collaborated on an advertising campaign that uses bone conduction that was premiered in Cannes, France at the International Festival of Creativity in June 2013. The &quot;Talking Window&quot; advertising concept uses bone conduction to transmit advertising to public transport passengers who lean their heads against train glass windows. Academics from Australia&#x27;s Macquarie University suggested that, apart from not touching the window, passengers would need to use a dampening device that is made of material that would not transmit the vibration from the window in order to not hear the sound.

Land Rover BAR employed &#x27;military&#x27; bone conduction technology, designed by BAE Systems, within their helmets for use within the 2017 America&#x27;s Cup. The helmets allowed the crews to communicate effectively with each other under race conditions and within the harsh, noisy environment; whilst maintaining situational awareness due to their ears being uncovered.

In March 2019 at The National Maritime Museum, London, British composer Hollie Harding premiered the use of Bone Conduction Headphones as part of a musical performance. The use of the technology allowed the audience to listen to a pre-recorded musical track on the headsets, whilst a live orchestra performed a separate but related musical track. This multilayered effect meant that electronic and digitally-edited sounds could be heard in conjunction with live music without the use of loud-speakers for the first time and that the source of sounds could appear to be close to, far from, or all around the listener.

Research has found that the use of bone conduction headphones can help people distinguish between their own voice and the voice of others. The findings have potential clinical relevance for conditions such as schizophrenia.

== Safety ==
Because bone conduction headphones transmit sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull, leaving the ears free to pick up sound from the environment, users can listen to audio while maintaining greater situational awareness than with acoustic in- or over-ear headphones. However, users may still be less aware of their environment than if not using headphones.

<text>The Chrysler 300 is a full-size car manufactured and marketed by Stellantis North America and its predecessor companies. It was available as a four-door sedan and station wagon in its first generation (model years 2005–2010), and solely as a four-door sedan in its second generation (model years 2011–2023). 

The second generation 300 was marketed as the Chrysler 300C in the United Kingdom and Ireland and as the Lancia Thema in the remainder of Europe.

==Background==
The Chrysler 300 continues a tradition of full-sized, front-engine, rear-wheel drive, V8-powered luxury sedans the company has offered, starting in the 1940s with the Chrysler Saratoga and Chrysler New Yorker, followed by the Chrysler Windsor, Chrysler Newport, and the Chrysler Cordoba, with the last rear wheel drive sedan, the Chrysler Fifth Avenue that ended production in 1989. 

When the company began operations in 1925, the Chrysler Six was entered as a roadster in the 1925 24 Hours of Le Mans where it finished the race. In 1926, the Chrysler Imperial started the luxury and performance products tradition. Starting in 1955, the Imperial became a separate luxury brand and offered the Imperial Newport along with the Imperial Crown. The original Chrysler &quot;FirePower&quot; Hemi engine powered the Cunningham C-5R, a special racecar, and finished the 1952 Le Mans, 1953 Le Mans, and 1954 Le Mans endurance races, as well as the 1953 12 Hours of Sebring.

==First generation (2005)==
The 300 debuted as a concept at the 2003 New York International Auto Show with styling by Ralph Gilles, and production started in January 2004 for the 2005 model year. The Chrysler 300 was designed as a modern interpretation of the 1955 Chrysler C-300 (and the letter series Chryslers that followed), featuring a large grille, long hood and low roofline that was prominent on those vehicles. The styling retained many elements of the 1998 Chrysler Chronos concept car, such as chrome interior accents and tortoiseshell finishing on the steering wheel and shifter knob. It was the last Chrysler vehicle designed under Tom Gale upon his retirement from DaimlerChrysler in December 2000. It shares a nameplate with the 1957 300C letter series two-door hardtop and convertible.

The Chrysler 300 is based on the rear-wheel drive Chrysler LX platform with Chrysler executives confirming that Chrysler engineers were sent to Germany to study the upcoming E-Class and as such, structural elements of the car&#x27;s foundation such as the toe board, safety cage architecture, as well as the load-path philosophy ending up being derived from the design(s) utilized by then-partner, Mercedes-Benz Shared and or derived components from Mercedes-Benz included: the 3.0L OM642 turbo-diesel V6 used in overseas markets, the rear suspension cradle and 5-link independent rear suspension design derived from the E-Class, a double-wishbone front suspension design with short-and-long arm front suspension geometry derived from the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220). The five-speed NAG1 W5A580 transmission, rear differential, driveshaft, ESP &amp; ABS systems, steering system, the CAN Bus electrical architecture, and cabin electronics, including other electronic and engine modules, were derived from Mercedes-Benz components. Further, switchgear such as the cruise control and turn signal combination stalk, seat controls, seat frames, HVAC system(s), and the wiring harness were utilized from Mercedes-Benz components. Later model years also feature a Mercedes-Benz-derived laser key ignition system instead of the traditional metal key. The AWD models also benefited from using Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s 4MATIC system, including transfer case components.

=== Model range ===

==== Base ====
The basic 300 includes 17-inch wheels, wheel covers, four-wheel disc brakes, a single disc CD player, an auxiliary input jack, a power driver seat, and a four-speed (42RLE) automatic transmission. It uses a EER V6 rated at . In Canada, it came standard with the Touring model&#x27;s V6 engine. The vehicle comes with standard rear-wheel drive and available all-wheel drive. The basic 300 model was renamed to LX for 2008 and remains the code name for the platform.

==== Touring ====
The Touring model uses a V6, producing and of torque, either a four- or five-speed transmission depending on the year and drive configuration, and comes with 17-inch aluminum wheels, AM/FM radio with CD player and auxiliary audio jack, Electronic Stability Program (ESP), remote keyless entry, leather-trimmed seats, and Sirius Satellite Radio. This model was renamed Touring Plus for the 2009 and 2010 model years.

==== Limited ====
The Limited model included the Touring model&#x27;s 3.5 L V6 engine, generating and and either a four- or five-speed transmission depending on the year and drive configuration. Additional features included 18-inch chrome-clad aluminum road wheels and anti-roll bars.

==== 300C ====
The top-of-the-line 300C version uses a 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi V8. Using the Multi-Displacement System (MDS), this engine can run on four cylinders when less power is needed to reduce total fuel consumption. The USEPA-rated fuel consumption of the 300C is: city, and highway. When all eight cylinders are needed, the 300C can produce and of torque. It uses a five-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with 18-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;MyGIG Infotainment System&quot; in 2008, as well as Sirius Satellite Radio and &quot;Backseat Television&quot; in 2008. 

The Hemi cylinder heads necessitate a double rocker arm shaft configuration with a cam-in-block, overhead valve (OHV) pushrod design. There are two spark plugs per cylinder to promote efficient fuel/air mixture burn and reduce emissions. For 2009 and 2010, power output was increased to .

==== SRT-8 ====
The SRT-8 model was equipped with a 6.1 L Hemi engine producing at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm. The SRT8 can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.9 seconds.

==== SRT Design ====

In 2008, Chrysler began producing the SRT Design, which combined the 300C CRD engine with all the refinements and sports setup of the SRT 8. This model was predominantly used in the European market.

=== Other variants ===

==== Station wagon ====

Chrysler marketed the 300C in Europe, Australia, South America, the Middle East, and Japan as both a four-door notchback sedan and a five-door station wagon. The five-door station wagon was marketed as the 300C Touring (not to be confused with the North American notchback sedan&#x27;s &quot;Touring&quot; trim level), which shared its sheet metal aft of the C-pillar and wheel designs with the Dodge Magnum. 

The base Chrysler 300 was not marketed in Europe. All cars came with the 300C body style/interior and either V6 diesel or V8 gasoline engines. The economical V6 diesel, sourced from Mercedes-Benz, was optional in Europe. All 300C Touring models, along with European 300C sedans and right-hand drive models, were assembled by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, beginning in June 2005. Steyr insisted on upgrading suspension components to suit European tastes. Dodge Charger/Magnum wheels with Chrysler center caps were used instead of the distinct wheels used on Canada-assembled models. The five-door station wagon body style was discontinued after the first generation.

====Diesel (2006–2011)====
In Europe and Australia, the 300C was available with a Mercedes-Benz 3.0 L diesel V6 engine (internal code OM642) rated at 3800 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm. Fuel economy for the 300C diesel is rated at city, highway, and on the combined cycle. It can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 7.9 seconds while the top speed remains the same as the gasoline V6 ().

The 2008 UK models included the 300C SRT-Design model in sedan or Touring body, which included SRT 20-inch alloy wheels and wheel arch spats, chrome mesh grille, MyGIG satellite navigation, SRT-8 steering wheel, SRT-8 leather sports seats, and carbon fiber interior details.

==== ASC Helios 300 ====
ASC created a convertible version of the Chrysler 300C, dubbed the ASC Helios 300, and unveiled it at the North American International Auto Show in early 2005. Despite rumors, Chrysler confirmed that the vehicle would not be produced.

==== Executive Series 300 ====
The Walter P. Chrysler Executive Series 300 was an extended wheelbase version shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show. It added 6 inches (152 mm) to the rear passenger compartment. The wheelbase was for this edition.

==== Signature Executive Series 300 ====
The Walter P. Chrysler Signature Executive Series 300 was a package offered from the factory for the touring V6 model after 2008. It shared many features with the executive series, omitting the extra 6 inches and the rear DVD player in the passenger compartment. The Signature Touring included special badging, 18-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, 6.5-inch MyGIG REN 430(N) touchscreen DVD player with optional uConnect+navigation, Boston Acoustic six-speaker sound system, heated leather-trimmed seats, heated and powered mirrors, eight-way power seats, power-adjustable pedals, and sunroof. It was offered for an additional CAD 2,240 in Canada.

Heritage Edition 300C
The Chrysler 300C Heritage Edition debuted in 2006 and was a performance-oriented trim that used the 5.7 Hemi and had styling cues from the Chrysler 300 &quot;letter series&quot; of the 1950s and the 1960s.

==== Beijing Auto T8 ====
The Beijing Auto T8 was a Chinese limousine version of the Chrysler 300. Beijing Auto produced two prototypes. The T8 got a new Cadillac-style nose and a new rear end; however, the rest of the design remained unchanged from the standard Chrysler 300. The only changes to the interior were a revised steering wheel with an updated logo. Beijing Auto did not have the right to continue to use the platform(s) or engine(s) necessary to produce the vehicle. Therefore, the continuation of the T8&#x27;s development and production prospects ended in 2009.

=== Reception and legacy ===
The Chrysler 300&#x27;s driving characteristics were generally well-received. The ride of the car was described as &quot;steady, comfortable, and a study in control&quot; The car drove &quot;a lot like a Benz&quot; due to the heavy use of German engineering and involvement of Mercedes-Benz in the development process during Chrysler and Daimler&#x27;s partnership. The car was also described as &quot;impressively stable at high speed&quot; by journalists at speeds even in excess of 150+ MPH on German autobahns, on par with other German sedans of the era. Again, such attributes could be attributed to the car&#x27;s German underpinnings. However, a real weakness in the car&#x27;s driving experience was &quot;numb steering,&quot; which many journalists claimed made the car feel &quot;capable, but disconnected.&quot;

In the UK, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; team described the 300C as &quot;something different with a bit of kitsch gangster cool&quot;. They praised the spacious and well-equipped interior, even calling it a &quot;re-shelled German car with an American body,&quot; and the low price while criticizing the quality of certain materials, numb steering, and low engine torque of the V6 models.
 The first generation model was popular with British buyers who regarded it as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Bentley&quot;.

In the US, the 300C enjoyed a wave of popularity in the mid-2000s, aided by celebrity owners (including US President Barack Obama,) and appearances in music videos. In 2004, rapper Snoop Dogg famously called then-Chrysler CEO, Dieter Zetsche, asking for his own 300C; he later appeared in a commercial for the car alongside Lee Iacocca. The 300C was ranked No. 12 in a Complex.com article, &quot;The 25 Most Iconic Hip-Hop Cars&quot;, due to its popularity in many hip-hop music videos following its introduction. Chrysler 300 designer Ralph Gilles reflected on the vehicle&#x27;s success in 2008, saying that the &quot;300 turned out to be a bit of an icon for Chrysler&quot;.

=== Awards ===
The 300C was the 2005 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year. It was on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Ten Best list for both 2005 and 2006. &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; named it Automobile of the Year.

It also won the &quot;North American Car of the Year&quot; award. It was voted Canadian Car of the Year by automobile journalists as the &quot;Best New Luxury Car&quot;.

Receiving numerous other recognitions during its debut year, it was promoted as being one of the most awarded new cars ever. The 300C was also included in the finalists for 2005 World Car of the Year, but final points total put it in fifth place equal to the BMW 1-series.

==Second generation (LD; 2011)==
A redesigned 300 was introduced in 2011 as a four-door sedan. However, the core platform of the car, now called the &#x27;LD&#x27; while updated, was still closely related to the original &#x27;LX&#x27; platform. While the suspension was revised, the front suspension is still derived from the design of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220) and the 5-link rear design from the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211). Production ended on December 8, 2023.

=== Exterior design ===

Exterior changes included revised sheet metal, thinner roof pillars, a more raked windshield, bi-xenon HID projector headlights, LED daytime running strips within the headlights, new taillights with LEDs and a horizontally slotted front grille with an updated version of the Chrysler winged brand emblem. Options included a dual-pane panoramic sunroof and 20-inch polished aluminum wheels.
===Variants===
The 2011 model was offered in Touring, Limited, 300C, and 300C AWD trim levels. Touring and Limited trims included the Pentastar V6, while the 300C line offered a standard 5.7 L Hemi.

A new 300C Executive Series luxury trim level was introduced alongside a new 300S trim at the 2011 New York International Auto Show. The sport-themed 300S featured black treatment for the grille and headlamps, 20-inch polished-face aluminum wheels with black painted pockets, 10-speaker &quot;Beats by Dr. Dre&quot; sound system, and steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The Executive/Luxury Series was also sold in Europe, rebranded as the Lancia Thema from 2011 until 2014.

For the 2021 model year, the 300C and Limited trim levels were dropped, leaving the Touring, Touring L, and 300S, which included the previous year&#x27;s Red S Appearance Package as standard.

==== SRT ====
An SRT version was unveiled at the 2011 New York International Auto Show, featuring the 6.4 L 392 Hemi V8 engine.

The 6.4 L 392 Hemi engine is also used in other Chrysler Group SRT vehicles such as the Dodge Charger and Challenger. With , the new 300 SRT can go from 0 to in the low 4-second range.

In addition to the increase in power, the SRT receives specific exterior trim including a lower front fascia, large exhaust tips, body-color instead of chrome trim, and 20-inch (508 mm) aluminum wheels. The car also gets a lowered, sportier suspension setup and a large Brembo brake package.

The 300 SRT (or SRT8) was discontinued for the 2015 model year in the United States, but continued to be sold in Australia and the Middle East. Many Australian police departments use the 300 SRT as a patrol/pursuit vehicle. The 300 SRT was sold in left and right-hand drive abroad. After a decade of falling sales in Australia, production of right-hand-drive versions ended in 2021.

=== Powertrain ===
The predecessors&#x27; 2.7 and 3.5 L engines were replaced with Chrysler&#x27;s new 3.6 L Pentastar V6 engine producing and of torque. The 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine remained available with . A 3.0 L VM Motori V6 turbodiesel is also available in Europe, and Australia.

Beginning with the 2012 model year, all V6 models were equipped with the 8-speed 845RE Chrysler Torqueflite automatic transmission, licensed from ZF Friedrichshafen.

=== Interior changes ===

Interior changes included a revised instrument panel with localized &quot;soft-touch&quot; materials, 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch, a new steering wheel and center console, and standard leather seating on all trim levels. Both seat-mounted and curtain-side airbags were standard.

=== 2015 facelift ===
In late 2014, a facelift version of the 300 was introduced. This introduced new features such as:
* Full speed range Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop
* Full-Speed Forward Collision Warning (FCW) with Active Braking
* Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist
* Updated Uconnect Systems with Bluetooth and Voice Command
* 7-inch electronic instrument cluster
* TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic transmission
* Restyled front and rear fascias
* New 3-spoke steering wheel design
* New black and silver mesh chrome grille

===Marketing===
As part of the 2011 Chrysler 300 advertising campaign, three TV commercials were produced. &quot;Homecoming&quot; featured Detroit Lions defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh driving through his rainy hometown of Portland, Oregon, in his new 2011 Chrysler 300, retracing his humble beginnings. &quot;Attitude&quot; featured John Varvatos seeking inspiration at a record store in Brooklyn taking a record under his arm and into his Chrysler 300. &quot;Good Things&quot; featured Dr. Dre driving through the streets of Los Angeles in a Beats by Dre equipped 2012 Chrysler 300.

The &quot;See It Through&quot;&#x27; TV commercial featured the Chrysler 300 and notable Detroit locals, including former Detroit Lion Ndamukong Suh and a poem written in 1917 by Edgar Guest titled &quot;See It Through&quot;.

===300S Turbine===
At the Detroit Motor Show in 2013, Chrysler presented a 300S paying homage to the 1964 Chrysler Turbine. It was finished in two-tone bronze and black, with an over-chrome grille and a 22-inch wheel design reminiscent of the turbine motif.

=== Recall ===
In March 2024, Stellantis issued a voluntary recall on Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 cars, between model years 2018 to 2021, the recall affected more than 284,000 cars. The recall relates to the side curtain airbag inflators, that some of the modules could rupture and send Shrapnel pieces into the vehicle, injuring the occupants.

===Discontinuation===
In 2022, Stellantis confirmed that the Chrysler 300 sedan would be discontinued after the 2023 model year due to poor sales and due to the company&#x27;s plans to focus its future on electric vehicles rather than fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Stellantis would replace the Chrysler 300 with a Chrysler-badged all-electric vehicle previewed by the Chrysler Airflow EV concept.

Production ended December 8, 2023, with the final vehicle being a Velvet Red 300C.

<text>Margaret Yvonne Middleton (September 1, 1922January 8, 2007), known professionally as Yvonne De Carlo, was a Canadian-American actress, dancer and singer. She became a Hollywood film star and sex symbol in the 1940s and 1950s, made several musical recordings, and later acted on television and stage.

De Carlo was born in Vancouver, British Columbia and was enrolled in a local dance school by her mother when she was three. By the early 1940s, she and her mother had moved to Los Angeles, where De Carlo entered beauty contests and worked as a dancer in nightclubs. In 1942, she signed a three-year contract with Paramount Pictures, where she got uncredited bit parts in important films. Her first lead was for producer E. B. Derr in the 1943 James Fenimore Cooper adventure &quot;Deerslayer&quot;.

She obtained her breakthrough role in &quot;Salome, Where She Danced&quot; (1945), a Universal Pictures release produced by Walter Wanger, who described her as &quot;the most beautiful girl in the world.&quot; The film&#x27;s publicity and success turned her into a star, and she signed a five-year contract with Universal. Universal starred her in its lavish Technicolor productions, such as &quot;Frontier Gal&quot; (1945), &quot;Song of Scheherazade&quot; (1947), and &quot;Slave Girl&quot; (1947). Cameramen voted her &quot;Queen of Technicolor&quot; three years in a row. Tired of being typecast as exotic women, she made her first serious dramatic performances in two film noirs, &quot;Brute Force&quot; (1947) and &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949).

The first American film star to visit Israel, De Carlo received further recognition as an actress for her leading performances in the British comedies &quot;Hotel Sahara&quot; (1951), &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1953), and &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1954). Her career reached its peak when eminent producer-director Cecil B. DeMille cast her as Moses&#x27; Midianite wife, Sephora in his biblical epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). For this role, she won a Laurel Award for Topliner Supporting Actress. Her success continued with other notable starring roles in &quot;Flame of the Islands&quot; (1956), &quot;Death of a Scoundrel&quot; (1956), &quot;Band of Angels&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Sword and the Cross&quot; (1958), in which she portrayed Mary Magdalene.

She starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Munsters&quot; (1964–1966), playing Herman Munster&#x27;s glamorous ghoulish wife, Lily, a role she reprised in the feature film &quot;Munster, Go Home!&quot; (1966) and the TV film &quot;The Munsters&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1981). In 1971, she played Carlotta Campion and introduced the popular song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; in the Broadway production of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot;. &quot;Yvonne&quot;, her best-selling autobiography, was published in 1987. A stroke survivor, De Carlo died of heart failure in 2007. She was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures and television.

==Early life==
De Carlo was born Margaret Yvonne Middleton on September 1, 1922, at St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Her nickname was &quot;Peggy&quot; because she was named after the silent film star Baby Peggy. Her mother, Marie De Carlo, was born in France to a Sicilian father and a Scottish mother. Marie, a &quot;wayward and rebellious&quot; teenager, aspired to become a dancer and worked as a milliner&#x27;s apprentice until she met Peggy&#x27;s father, William Shelto Middleton. Middleton was a salesman born in New Zealand to English parents and had &quot;piercing eyes of pale blue, and a wealth of straight black hair.&quot;

Marie and William married in Alberta, where they lived for a couple of months before returning to Vancouver. They moved in with Marie&#x27;s parents, but the marriage was troubled. Peggy had only two memories of her father: climbing up to his knee and crawling toward his feet. By the time Peggy was three, William was involved in various swindles and fled Canada aboard a schooner, promising to send for his wife and child. Marie and Peggy never heard from him again; rumors said that he remarried twice and had more children, worked as an actor in silent films, or died aboard a ship. Peggy later wrote, &quot;My own assumption is that he died before he had the chance to discover that his Baby Peggy had become a Hollywood actress, or I think he would have tried to contact me.&quot; After William&#x27;s departure, Marie left her parents&#x27; home and found work in a shop.

Marie and Peggy lived in a succession of apartments in Vancouver, including one with no furniture or stove. They periodically returned to the De Carlo home, &quot;a huge white frame house&quot;, at 1728 Comox Street in Vancouver&#x27;s West End. Marie&#x27;s parents, Michele &quot;Papa&quot; De Carlo and Margaret Purvis De Carlo, were religious, attended church regularly, and held services in their parlor. Michele, a native of Messina, had met Margaret in Nice, France. They married in 1897, had four children, and settled in Canada.

De Carlo attended Lord Roberts Elementary School, a block from her grandparents&#x27; home. She originally wanted to be a writer. She was seven when a school assignment, a poem she wrote titled &quot;A Little Boy,&quot; was entered in a contest run by the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;. She won and received a prize of $5, which according to De Carlo, meant as much to her at that time as if she had won the Nobel Peace Prize. She also wrote short plays, which she usually staged in her grandparents&#x27; house, and even adapted Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; for a neighborhood performance.

Marie wanted her daughter to have a career in show business and made sure Peggy received singing and dancing lessons. Peggy joined the choir of St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church to strengthen her voice. When she was ten (or three, according to a 1982 interview), her mother enrolled her in the June Roper School of the Dance in Vancouver. In May 1939, a &quot;Variety&quot; news item listed Yvonne de Carlo as one of the performers at the opening of Hy Singer&#x27;s Palomar ballroom (also known as Palomar Supper Club) in Vancouver.

==Early career==
===1940–1942: Beginnings in Hollywood===

De Carlo and her mother made several trips to Los Angeles. In 1940, she won second place in the Miss Venice beauty contest, and placed fifth in that year&#x27;s Miss California competition (and can be seen in that pageant at 0:36 of the British Pathé film &quot;A Matter of Figures&quot;). At the Miss Venice contest, she was noticed by a booking agent who told her to audition for an opening in the chorus line at the Earl Carroll Theatre on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.

De Carlo and her mother arrived at Earl Carroll&#x27;s for the audition, but after learning that Carroll would have to examine her &quot;upper assets&quot; before hiring her, De Carlo and her mother searched for work at another popular Hollywood nightclub, the Florentine Gardens. They met the proprietor, Nils Granlund, and he introduced De Carlo to the audience before she tap danced to &quot;Tea for Two&quot;. Granlund then asked, &quot;Well, folks ... is she in or out?&quot; The audience responded with &quot;a rousing round of applause, with whistles and cheers&quot;, and De Carlo got the job. She started in the back of the chorus line, but after months of practice and hard work, Granlund featured her in a &quot;King Kong number.&quot; In it, she danced, and cast off several chiffon veils before being carried away by a gorilla. She was given more solo routines. 

She had been dancing at the Florentine Gardens only a few months when she was arrested by immigration officials and deported to Canada in late 1940. In January 1941, Granlund sent a telegram to immigration officials pledging his sponsorship of De Carlo in the US, and affirmed his offer of steady employment, both requirements to reenter the country.

In May 1941, she appeared in a revue, &quot;Hollywood Revels&quot;, at the Orpheum Theatre. A critic from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; who reviewed it said the &quot;dancing of Yvonne de Carlo is especially notable.&quot; She also made her debut on network radio with Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen, who were performing extracts from a series based on their Flagg-Quirt performances.

De Carlo wanted to act. At the encouragement of her friend Artie Shaw, who offered to pay her wages for a month, she quit the Florentine Gardens and hired talent agent Jack Pomeroy. Pomeroy got De Carlo an uncredited role as a bathing beauty in a Columbia Pictures B film, &quot;Harvard, Here I Come&quot; (1941). She had one line (&quot;Nowadays a girl must show a front&quot;) in a scene with the film&#x27;s star, ex-boxer Maxie Rosenbloom. Her salary was $25 and her work got her into the Screen Actors Guild. While at Columbia she was featured in a two-reel collegiate comedy, &quot;The Kink of the Campus&quot; (1941). She also starred in &quot;The Lamp of Memory&quot; (1942), a three-minute musical film designed to be shown in coin-operated &quot;Soundies&quot; movie jukeboxes.

When no other acting jobs came her way, she decided to return to the chorus line and auditioned for Earl Carroll, who hired her. While working for Carroll, she won a one-line part in &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942) at Paramount. Carroll found out and fired her, as he did not allow his dancers to work outside the nightclub without permission. She asked Granlund if he would rehire her, and he did. In December 1941, she was dancing in the &quot;Glamour Over Hollywood&quot; revue at the Gardens. America&#x27;s entry into World War II saw De Carlo and other Florentine dancers busy entertaining troops at USO shows. A skilled horsewoman, she also appeared in a number of West Coast rodeos.

===1942–1944: Contract with Paramount===

Following an interview at Paramount, De Carlo was cast as one of Dorothy Lamour&#x27;s handmaidens in &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; (1942). She got a screen test for the role of Ata in &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;, but lost to Elena Verdugo. She returned to Paramount for a bit role in &quot;Lucky Jordan&quot; (1942) and found another small part in a Republic Pictures film, &quot;Youth on Parade&quot; (1942), which she later called a &quot;dreadful ... bomb.&quot; After recovering from bronchial pneumonia, she went to Paramount and signed a six-month contract, possibly going up to seven years, starting at $60 a week.

For her first assignment as a Paramount player, De Carlo was loaned to Monogram Pictures to play a Florentine Gardens dancer in &quot;Rhythm Parade&quot;, starring Nils Granlund (who had requested her for the role) and Gale Storm. She then appeared as an extra in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot; (1943), of which she wrote, &quot;Only my left shoulder survived after editing.&quot; She asked director Sam Wood for a part in his next film, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), and he gave her a small role in the cantina scene with Gary Cooper.

De Carlo was also seen in &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It&quot; (1943), &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; (1943) and &quot;Salute for Three&quot; (1943). She kept busy in small roles and helping other actors shoot tests. &quot;I was the test queen at Paramount,&quot; she said later. But she was ambitious and wanted more. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to be just one of the girls,&quot; she said. Cecil B. DeMille, Paramount&#x27;s most famous director, saw De Carlo in &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; and arranged for a screen test and interview for a part in his film &quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot; (1943). He subsequently selected her for a key role. He ended up choosing Carol Thurston for the role of Tremartini and casting De Carlo in an uncredited part as a native girl, but promised her another role in a future film.

Shortly after losing the Tremartini role, De Carlo was loaned to Republic Pictures to portray Native American princess Wah-Tah in &quot;Deerslayer&quot;. It was her first featured role in a full-length film. At Paramount, she played unbilled bit roles in &quot;True to Life&quot; (1943) and &quot;Standing Room Only&quot; (1944). She also tested for the role of Lola in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944). She was billed in a short, &quot;Fun Time&quot; (1944) and went to MGM to play an uncredited lady-in-waiting in &quot;Kismet&quot; (1944).

The &quot;New York Times&quot; later dubbed De Carlo &quot;threat girl&quot; for Dorothy Lamour &quot;when Dotty wanted to break away from saronging.&quot; This had its origin when De Carlo was set to replace Dorothy Lamour in &quot;Rainbow Island&quot; (1944); however, Lamour changed her mind about the role. De Carlo was given a bit part in the final movie.

De Carlo played further unbilled roles in &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot; (1944), &quot;Practically Yours&quot; (1944), and &quot;Bring on the Girls&quot; (1945). Paramount decided not to renew her contract option, but did renew Lamour&#x27;s contract.

==Stardom==
===1944–1945: &quot;Salome, Where She Danced&quot;===

De Carlo was screen tested by Universal, who were looking for an exotic glamour girl in the mold of Maria Montez and Acquanetta. The test was seen by Walter Wanger who was making an adventure film in Technicolor, &quot;Salome, Where She Danced&quot; (1945). Wanger later claimed he discovered De Carlo when looking at footage for another actor in which De Carlo also happened to appear (Milburn Stone).

Wanger tested De Carlo several times and Universal signed her to a long-term contract at $150 a week. In September 1944, it was announced that De Carlo was cast in the lead of &quot;Salome&quot; over a reported 20,000 other young women. Another source claimed 21 Royal Canadian Air Force bombardier students who loved De Carlo as a pinup star had campaigned to get her the role. De Carlo later said this was done at her behest; she took several pictures of herself in a revealing costume and persuaded two childhood friends from Vancouver, Reginald Reid and Kenneth Ross McKenzie, who had become pilots, to arrange their friends to lobby on her behalf, writing in her memoirs that the whole thing was Wanger&#x27;s idea. Though not a critical success, &quot;Salome&quot; was a box office favorite, and the heavily promoted De Carlo was hailed as an up-and-coming star.

In his review of the film, Bosley Crowther of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote:

Miss De Carlo has an agreeable mezzo-soprano singing voice, all the &#x27;looks&#x27; one girl could ask for, and, moreover, she dances with a sensuousness which must have caused the Hays office some anguish. The script, however, does not give her much chance to prove her acting talents.

===1946–1950: Universal&#x27;s Queen of Technicolor===

Universal signed de Carlo to a long-term contract. She was used by the studio as a backup star to Maria Montez, and her second movie for the studio saw her step into a role rejected by Montez: the Western &quot;Frontier Gal&quot; (1946) alongside Rod Cameron. In 1946, exhibitors voted De Carlo the ninth-most promising &quot;star of tomorrow.&quot; Like &quot;Salome&quot;, it was shot in Technicolor.

De Carlo followed &quot;Frontier Gal&quot; with a top-billed role in Walter Reisch&#x27;s Technicolor musical &quot;Song of Scheherazade&quot; (1947), co-starring Brian Donlevy and Jean-Pierre Aumont. Tilly Losch, an Austrian dancer and friend of Reisch, coached De Carlo in her three dancing solos. The film was a hit, making over $2 million.

De Carlo wanted to act in different types of movies. She applied to play the part of a waitress in &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947) but lost out to Shelley Winters. Instead, Universal put her back in Technicolor for &quot;Slave Girl&quot; (1947), made with the producers of &quot;Frontier Gal&quot;. It was another solid commercial success. De Carlo was given a small role in &quot;Brute Force&quot; (1947), a prison movie starring Burt Lancaster and produced by Mark Hellinger. It was her first movie in black and white since becoming a star and her first to get good reviews.

She played Lola Montez in &quot;Black Bart&quot; (1948), a Technicolor Western with Dan Duryea for director George Sherman. Duryea and Sherman worked with her again on &quot;River Lady&quot; (1948). De Carlo called these films &quot;physically taxing but not creatively inspiring.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; later summarised them as &quot;a series of routine costume adventures as a tough but good-natured minx from across the tracks who wades into society and inevitably backtracks with a bloke of her own caliber.&quot;

She romanced Tony Martin in &quot;Casbah&quot; (1948), a musical remake of &quot;Algiers&quot; (1938) made for Martin&#x27;s own production company but released through Universal. De Carlo was reluctant to be in it because, though she would receive top billing over Martin, she did not get the female lead. That part went to Swedish newcomer Märta Torén. However, studio head William Goetz insisted that De Carlo play Inez, the role Sigrid Gurie acted in the 1938 version. She also sang the film&#x27;s song &quot;For Every Man There&#x27;s a Woman&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The film flopped at the box office, de Carlo&#x27;s first flop since becoming a star.
De Carlo then received an offer from Mark Hellinger to make another film with Burt Lancaster: the film noir &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949). This time De Carlo had a larger role, as a femme fatale, Anna. Bosley Crowther noted that De Carlo was &quot;trying something different as Anna. The change is welcome, even though Miss de Carlo&#x27;s performance is uneven. In that respect, she is right in step with most everything else about &quot;Criss Cross.&quot;&quot; The film has become regarded as a classic and De Carlo considered the role the highlight of her career to date. Tony Curtis made his debut in the movie, in a scene dancing with De Carlo.

De Carlo was keen to make more movies along this line but Universal put her back in Technicolor Westerns with &quot;Calamity Jane and Sam Bass&quot; (1949), playing Calamity Jane, directed by Sherman, alongside Howard Duff.

She played a role intended for Deanna Durbin in &quot;The Gal Who Took the West&quot; (1950), for director Fred de Cordova. The movie gave her a chance to show off her singing voice. Trained in opera and a former child chorister at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, Vancouver, De Carlo possessed a large vocal range. She was meant to be in &quot;Bagdad&quot; (1949) but suffered a miscarriage and was ill, so the studio cast Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

De Cordova directed de Carlo in &quot;Buccaneer&#x27;s Girl&quot; (1950), a pirate movie set in 1810s New Orleans opposite Philip Friend was a box office and critical failure. The director later called De Carlo &quot;a doll ... underrated as an actress. She was most professional, worked hard, was very good at her craft, possibly was not a first class star but came in on schedule. She knew her lines, she danced and sang rather well, and she wanted very much to be a bigger star than she ever became.&quot;

She toured US army bases singing, then was in &quot;The Desert Hawk&quot; (1950), an &quot;Eastern&quot; with Richard Greene. She made a Western with Sherman, &quot;Tomahawk&quot; (1951), opposite Van Heflin, which was popular.

===1951–1952: Live performances and TV debut ===
De Carlo toured extensively to promote her films and entertained US troops in Europe. She also began singing on television. She received an offer from England to make a comedy, &quot;Hotel Sahara&quot; (1951) with Peter Ustinov. While in England, she asked Universal to release her from her contract, though it still had three months to go, and the studio agreed.
While in England, De Carlo recorded two singles, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;I Love a Man&quot;. In March 1951 she signed a new contract with Universal to make one film a year for three years.

De Carlo went to Paramount to make a Western, &quot;Silver City&quot; (1951), for producer Nat Holt, co-starring alongside Edmond O&#x27;Brien for a fee of $50,000.

In 1951, De Carlo accepted an offer to open the thirtieth season of the Hollywood Bowl singing the breeches role of Prince Orlovsky in five performances of the opera &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (&quot;The Bat&quot;), from July 10 to 14. The performances were conducted by noted film composer Franz Waxman. In her autobiography she described her participation in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; as &quot;a rewarding experience, the aesthetic highlight of my life.&quot;

In August 1951, De Carlo became the first Canadian film star to visit the State of Israel, giving concerts in Haifa, Ramat Gan, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Jaffa. She drew capacity audiences and was &quot;royally received&quot; by the Israeli government and the public. Her performances consisted of singing and dancing routines from her films.

She discovered that her films were extremely popular there, saying, &quot;Every time I played a concert, someone would yell, &#x27;Sing something from &quot;Casbah&quot;.&#x27;&quot; About the warm reception she received in Israel, she told columnist Louella Parsons:

De Carlo returned early from Tel Aviv to make &quot;The San Francisco Story&quot; (1952) with Joel McCrea. It was the first of a two-picture deal with Fidelity Pictures; the second was to be &quot;The Scarlet Flame&quot; about Brazil&#x27;s battle for independence, which was never made.

She made her live TV debut in &quot;Another Country&quot; for &quot;Lights Out&quot; (1952). De Carlo wanted to make a film for Sydney Box called &quot;Queen of Sheba&quot; with Peter Ustinov as Solomon but it was never made.

She went back to Universal for the first movie under her new contract, &quot;Scarlet Angel&quot; (1952) with Rock Hudson. At Paramount, she did another film for Nat Holt, &quot;Hurricane Smith&quot; (1952), then she appeared in &quot;Madame 44&quot; for &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; (1952). She announced plans to form her own production company with her agent, Vancouver Productions. However, as she later wrote, &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; came of this.

===1953–1954: International movie star===
De Carlo went to MGM to make &quot;Sombrero&quot; (1953), mostly shot in Mexico. She liked her character because it was &quot;almost madonnalike. It is a role that demands the most sincerity for its proper interpretation. Many pictures that I have done perhaps offered me typical outdoor parts or western, heroine parts. So long as I could convey a flashy sort of impression it was alright... I don&#x27;t deny the importance of such parts for me. They are excellent. But is stands to reason that as one goes on one seeks less superficial assignments.

De Carlo was reunited with Hudson for &quot;Sea Devils&quot; (1953), a Napoleonic adventure tale shot in Britain and France released through RKO. This meant she had to postpone a film she was going to make for Edward Small, &quot;Savage Frontier&quot;. She was offered a role in &quot;Innocents in Paris&quot; (1953) but ultimately did not appear in the film.

Back in the US, she had an adventure film set in the desert, &quot;Fort Algiers&quot; (1953), for United Artists, starring Carlos Thompson, whom de Carlo had recommended.
She made her third film in Britain with &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1953), a comedy featuring the two wives a ship captain (played by Alec Guinness) keeps in separate ports. De Carlo played Nita, the sensual wife who lives in Morocco, while Celia Johnson played Maud, the demure wife who lives in Gibraltar. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther commended her performance by writing, &quot;And Miss De Carlo, as the siren, &#x27;the mate of the tiger&#x27; in Mr. G. [Guinness], is wonderfully candid and suggestive of the hausfrau in every dame.&quot;

De Carlo made a fourth film in England, &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1954) released in the U.S. as &quot;Tonight&#x27;s The Night&quot;, a comedy featuring her as the love interest for David Niven, who inherits an estate in Ireland. She was then called back to the U.S. to do a contemporary TV comedy, &quot;The Backbone of America&quot; (1953) with Wendell Corey. In 1954, after the success of &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, she expressed a desire to do more comedy:

I&#x27;ve had my share of sirens and am happy to get away from them, no matter what the part. Just to look pretty on the screen as a romantic lead is probably all right, but – so what? I&#x27;d much rather do something in a good Western provided there&#x27;s plenty of action. Action is what I like.

De Carlo went back to Universal to make a Western with McCrea, &quot;Border River&quot; (1954), directed by Sherman. She went to Italy for &quot;The Contessa&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1954) and returned to Hollywood for the independently produced &quot;Passion&quot; (1954). She wrote a 42-page treatment for a science-fiction film &quot;Operation Sram&quot;, which was not made. De Carlo made the Western &quot;Shotgun&quot; (1955) with Sterling Hayden for Allied Artists. She did &quot;Hot Cargo&quot; for &quot;Screen Director&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; (1956) with Rory Calhoun directed by Tay Garnett.

De Carlo made her third film for Universal under her new contract in &quot;Raw Edge&quot; (1956). Republic starred her as Minna Wagner in a biopic of Richard Wagner, &quot;Magic Fire&quot; (1956). On TV she was in &quot;The Sainted General&quot; for &quot;Star Stage&quot; (1956). Republic reunited her with Duff in &quot;Flame of the Islands&quot; (1956), shot in the Bahamas.

===1955–1956: Award-winning performance in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;===

In September 1954, producer-director Cecil B. DeMille cast her as Sephora, the wife of Moses (played by Charlton Heston), in his biblical epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, a Paramount Pictures production that premiered in November 1956. In his autobiography, DeMille explained he decided to cast De Carlo as Moses&#x27; wife after his casting director, Bert McKay, called his attention to one scene she played in &quot;Sombrero&quot;. Even though the film &quot;was a picture far removed in theme from &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;,&quot; wrote DeMille, &quot;I sensed in her a depth, an emotional power, a womanly strength which the part of Sephora needed and which she gave it.&quot;

She prepared extensively for the role, taking weaving lessons at the University of California, Los Angeles, and shepherding lessons in the San Fernando Valley. Months before filming began, she had worked on the part with a drama coach. Her scenes were shot on Paramount&#x27;s sound stages in 1955. Her performance received praise from critics. Crowther, the &quot;New York Times&quot; critic, was impressed: &quot;Yvonne De Carlo as the Midianite shepherdess to whom Moses is wed is notably good in a severe role.&quot; The &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that she &quot;is very fine as the simple Sephora,&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; noticed that she &quot;plays the wife of Moses with conviction.&quot; De Carlo was expected to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but she preferred to be listed as a leading actress on the voting ballot and was not nominated in that category. However, she won a Laurel Award for Topliner Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.

She fell in love with stuntman Bob Morgan while visiting the filming of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; in Egypt in 1954. They married in 1955, and their first son, Bruce, was born in 1956. DeMille became Bruce&#x27;s godfather. Her second pregnancy meant she had to turn down the role of the female pirate DeMille had given her in his next production, &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1958).

It was announced she would team with Vittorio De Sica in an adaptation of &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot; to be shot in English and Italian but the film was never made. Neither were two projects de Carlo was meant to make in Italy following &quot;Raw Edge&quot;, &quot;The Mistress of Lebanon Castle&quot; with Trevor Howard and &quot;Honeymoon in Italy&quot;. Instead, De Carlo co-starred with George Sanders and Zsa Zsa Gabor in &quot;Death of a Scoundrel&quot; (1956). The &quot;New York Times&quot; commended her performance as Bridget Kelly: &quot;Yvonne De Carlo does a solid and professional job as the adoring petty thief who rises to eminence with him [Sanders&#x27; character].&quot;

===1957–1964: &quot;Band of Angels&quot; and Broadway debut ===

As a result of the great success and positive reviews of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, De Carlo was offered lead roles in two Warner Bros. films that would be shot at the same time: &quot;The Helen Morgan Story&quot; and &quot;Band of Angels&quot;, based on Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s novel. De Carlo chose the latter because her co-star would be Clark Gable, one of her favorite actors. The title refers to the short life expectancy of the black soldiers who fought with the Union troops in the Civil War, but the story is mainly about Amantha &quot;Manty&quot; Starr, a mixed-race Southern belle who is sold as a slave after her father&#x27;s death and discovers that her deceased mother was a black slave on her father&#x27;s plantation. Amantha is then taken to New Orleans where she is bought by plantation owner Hamish Bond (Gable), who falls in love with her. The film was both a critical and financial disappointment at the time of release.

On the small screen she was in &quot;Skits &amp; Sketches&quot; for &quot;Shower of Stars&quot; (1957). She was also in &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (1957). De Carlo released an LP record of standards called &quot;Yvonne De Carlo Sings&quot; on Masterseal Records, a subsidiary label of Remington Records, in 1957. Orchestrated by future film composer John Williams under the pseudonym &quot;John Towner&quot;, the album contains ten tracks, &quot;End of a Love Affair&quot;, &quot;In the Blue of Evening&quot;, &quot;I Got It Bad (and That Ain&#x27;t Good)&quot;, &quot;Am I Blue?&quot;, &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, &quot;But Not for Me&quot;, &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;.

De Carlo was in &quot;Verdict of Three&quot; for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1958). She made a French Foreign Legion movie with Victor Mature, &quot;Timbuktu&quot;, directed by Jacques Tourneur (1958). She unsuccessfully auditioned for the Broadway musical &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; losing out to Dolores Gray.

In May 1958, De Carlo was signed to play Mary Magdalene in the Italian biblical epic &quot;The Sword and the Cross&quot; (tentatively titled &quot;The Great Sinner&quot; and released in the United States as &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;), with Jorge Mistral as her love interest, the Roman Gaius Marcellus, and Rossana Podestà as her sister, Martha. The film&#x27;s director, Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia, later remembered that &quot;producer, Ottavio Poggi, had sent the provisional script to America, so Yvonne De Carlo could read it and decide on her participation in the film. She read it and got very excited, agreeing to play the role of Magdalene.&quot; The film was shot in English and later dubbed in Italian.

De Carlo put together a nightclub act and toured with it in South America. She guest-starred on &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;A Rose for Lotta&quot;, 1959), &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; (&quot;Isle of Eden&quot;, 1960), &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (&quot;The Lady Was an M.D&quot;, 1961), &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (&quot;The Longest Crap Game in History&quot; [1961] and &quot;Annie Beeler&#x27;s Place&quot;, 1962) and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (&quot;Who Killed Beau Sparrow?&quot;, 1963). She also played &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; in summer stock.
De Carlo&#x27;s husband had become permanently disabled while working as a stunt man on &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1963), eventually losing his leg. De Carlo took any job going, appearing in night club acts across the country as well as a play in stock, &quot;Third Best Sport&quot;.

To help out, John Wayne offered her the supporting role of Louise Warren, the title character&#x27;s cook in &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963), with Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara. She was second billed in a Western &quot;Law of the Lawless&quot; (1964) and played the Spanish dancer Dolores in the Bob Hope comedy &quot;A Global Affair&quot; (1964).

De Carlo was in &quot;The Night the Monkey Died&quot; for &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1964). She took over a role on &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; on Broadway for a week and played in it when the production went on tour.

==Later career==
===1964–1966: &quot;The Munsters&quot;===

She was in debt by 1964 when she signed a contract with Universal Studios to perform the female lead role in &quot;The Munsters&quot; opposite Fred Gwynne. She was also the producers&#x27; choice to play Lily Munster when Joan Marshall, who played the character (originally called &quot;Phoebe&quot;), was dropped from consideration for the role. When De Carlo was asked how a glamorous actress could succeed as a ghoulish matriarch of a haunted house, she replied simply, &quot;I follow the directions I received on the first day of shooting: &#x27;Play her just like &quot;Donna Reed&quot;.&#x27;&quot; She sang and played the harp in at least one episode (&quot;Far Out Munsters&quot;) of &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation, she reprised her role as Lily Munster in the Technicolor film &quot;Munster, Go Home!&quot; (1966), partially in hopes of renewing interest in the sitcom. Despite the attempt, &quot;The Munsters&quot; was cancelled after 70 episodes. Of the sitcom and its cast and crew, she said: &quot;It was a happy show with audience appeal for both children and adults. It was a happy show behind the scenes, too; we all enjoy working with each other.&quot; Years later, in 1987, she said: &quot;I think Yvonne De Carlo was more famous than Lily, but I gained the younger audience through &quot;The Munsters&quot;. And it was a steady job.&quot;

===1967–1973: Stage appearances and &quot;Follies&quot;===
After &quot;The Munsters&quot;, she guest-starred in &quot;The Moulin Ruse Affair&quot; in &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Raiders&quot; for &quot;Custer&quot; (1967) and episodes of &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

She starred in &quot;Hostile Guns&quot; (1967) and &quot;Arizona Bushwhackers&quot; (1968), a pair of low-budget westerns produced by A. C. Lyles and released by Paramount Pictures. During this time, she also had a supporting role in the 1968 thriller &quot;The Power&quot;.

After 1967, De Carlo became increasingly active in musicals, appearing in off-Broadway productions of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. In early 1968 she joined Donald O&#x27;Connor in a 15-week run of &quot;Little Me&quot; staged between Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas and she did a five-month tour in &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;. Later she toured in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;.

De Carlo continued to appear in films such as &quot;The Delta Factor&quot; (1970) and had a notable part in Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot; (1971). The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said about the latter that De Carlo featured in &quot;an improbable sequence pulled off with verve by the still glamorous star.&quot;

Her defining stage role was as &quot;Carlotta Campion&quot; in Harold Prince&#x27;s production of the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot; in 1971–72. Playing a washed-up star at a reunion of old theater colleagues, she introduced the song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;. De Carlo said she was told the part was written especially for her.

In October 1972, De Carlo arrived in Australia to replace Cyd Charisse in Michael Edgley&#x27;s production of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. Her opening night was on November 6, 1972, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne. The show moved on to Adelaide, Sydney, and then to several New Zealand cities. It closed in the fall of 1973, and De Carlo returned to the United States.

In late 1973 and early 1974, she starred in a production of Ben Bagley&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Entire World as Seen Through the Eyes of Cole Porter&quot; in San Diego.

In May 1975, she starred in the San Bernardino Civic Light Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Applause&quot; at the California Theatre of the Performing Arts. &quot;The San Bernardino Sun&quot; described her performance as &quot;brilliant&quot; and wrote, &quot;a packed house watched Yvonne De Carlo give a new dimension to Margo Channing, a part she was playing for the first time, but nonetheless, a part she was very well suited for.&quot;

===1974–1995: Horror movies and final roles===
De Carlo appeared in &quot;The Girl on the Late, Late Show&quot; (1974), &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1974), &quot;Arizona Slim&quot; (1974), &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1975), &quot;It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time&quot; (1975), &quot;Black Fire&quot; (1975), and &quot;La casa de las sombras&quot; (1976).. Independent producer Sam Sherman hired her for a leading role in &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; (1975); despite its provocative title, it was a revival of 1940s westerns and co-starred former cowboy heroes Robert Livingston and Don &quot;Red&quot; Barry. De Carlo pre-recorded the vocal for an original song.

She continued to appear on stage, notably in &quot;Dames at Sea&quot;, &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

She was seen on &quot;Satan&#x27;s Cheerleaders&quot; (1977), &quot;Nocturna&quot; (1979), &quot;&quot; (1979), &quot;Fuego negro&quot; (1979), &quot;The Silent Scream&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Man with Bogart&#x27;s Face &quot; (1980). She guest-starred on shows like &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

De Carlo was in &quot;The Munsters&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1981), then &quot;Liar&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1982), &quot;Play Dead&quot; (1982), &quot;Vultures&quot; (1984), &quot;Flesh and Bullets&quot; (1985), and &quot;A Masterpiece of Murder&quot; (1986) (with Bob Hope). She was in a revival of &quot;The Munsters&quot;.

De Carlo&#x27;s later films included &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1988), for which she won the Best Actress Award from International Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Show (Fantafestival); &quot;Cellar Dweller&quot; (1988); and &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; (1990). She had a supporting role as the title character&#x27;s Aunt Rosa in the Sylvester Stallone comedy &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991). Aunt Rosa is present when Oscar&#x27;s father, played by Kirk Douglas, extracts &quot;a deathbed promise&quot; from his son. Of her role, De Carlo said, &quot;Mine is a small part—but funny.&quot;

She appeared in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (&quot;Jessica Behind Bars&quot;, 1985), &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; (1992), &quot;Seasons of the Heart&quot; (1993), and &quot;Death of Some Salesmen&quot; in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1993). She had a small cameo role in &quot;Here Come the Munsters&quot;, a 1995 television film remake of &quot;The Munsters&quot;. De Carlo, along with Al Lewis, Pat Priest, and Butch Patrick, did not have to wear costumes &quot;because the Munsters have several lives.&quot;

Her final performance was as Norma, &quot;an eccentric Norma Desmond lookalike&quot;, in the 1995 television film &quot;The Barefoot Executive&quot;, a Disney Channel remake of the 1971 film of the same title. Norma, a former stand-in for film actors, &quot;monkey-sits&quot; the title character, a chimpanzee named Archie who is able to predict top-rated television series. &quot;She has these outrageous costumes—six of them—and it&#x27;s just a small part&quot;, De Carlo told &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;But I like to do small things now.&quot;

In 2007, her son Bruce revealed that, before her death, she played supporting roles in two independent films that have yet to be released.

==Personal life==

In 1950, De Carlo purchased an eleven-room ranch house on five-and-a-half acres of &quot;hilly woodland&quot; on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Studio City, Los Angeles, above Beverly Hills. De Carlo described it as her &quot;dream home&quot; and hired an architect to help her design &quot;an English-style dining room, with paneling and stained-glass windows.&quot; She also built stables for her horses and a large swimming pool. She sold the property in 1975. In 1981, she moved to a ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley, near Solvang, California.

===Relationships===
In her autobiography, De Carlo considered director Billy Wilder &quot;the first big love of my life&quot;. They met in 1943 when she was under contract to Paramount Pictures. Although she described him as the physical &quot;antithesis of my lifelong dream man&quot;, she fell in love with him and admired his &quot;endless charm and wit&quot;. He was separated from his wife and lived in a rented house while they were together. Their short-lived relationship ended when he left her for actress Doris Dowling.

Regarding her ideal man, in May 1952 she said: “I have learned not to prefer anything because tastes change everyday. For instance, I used to prefer blond men but that is no longer true today.&quot; Five months later in October 1952 she said: &quot;I would like to marry a man with blonde hair.
From what I have heard, blond men make the most interesting husbands.&quot;

In 1945, after the release of her second film, &quot;Frontier Gal&quot;, De Carlo returned to Vancouver and attended a celebration held in her honor at her former workplace, the Palomar nightclub, where she was introduced to billionaire Howard Hughes. She later discovered he had flown directly from Los Angeles because he wanted to meet her outside of Hollywood. Hughes told her he had seen &quot;Salome, Where She Danced&quot; more than five times and was enthralled by her beauty. De Carlo initially &quot;felt just kind of sorry&quot; for the &quot;lanky, underfed, and remarkably sad&quot; Hughes. The following day they went out on a date and began a romantic relationship. Hughes preferred to keep their romance private and never mentioned it to the press. De Carlo wanted to marry him but he was not serious about their relationship. De Carlo later wrote, &quot;Howard Hughes was one of the most important loves of my life&quot;.

After her breakup with Hughes, De Carlo dated Robert Stack and Burt Lancaster, her &quot;Criss Cross&quot; co-star. During the filming of &quot;Brute Force&quot;, De Carlo fell in love with her co-star, fellow Universal contract player Howard Duff. Despite the fact that they &quot;had almost nothing in common,&quot; Duff was interested in marrying De Carlo and the studio approved their relationship. In April 1947, De Carlo announced her engagement to Duff, but they eventually separated due to his alcoholism.

De Carlo met Prince Abdul Reza Pahlavi of Iran when he visited Beverly Hills in 1947. A week later, they traveled to New York and spent some time together. After the completion of her film &quot;Casbah&quot;, De Carlo embarked on her first trip to Europe, reuniting with Prince Abdul in Paris. They vacationed in Switzerland and Italy, and, several months later, De Carlo also visited the royal palace in Tehran.

In the late 1940s, De Carlo began a relationship with Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who worked on her film &quot;The Gal Who Took the West&quot;. While she was engaged to Mahoney, De Carlo became pregnant and also discovered she had a large ovarian cyst. The tumor was surgically removed and, as a result, she lost the baby. Her relationship with Mahoney ended when De Carlo found out he was seeing another woman, actress Margaret Field.

In the 1950s, one of her fiancés was English photographer Cornel Lucas. In early 1954, she informed columnist Erskine Johnson about her engagement to Scottish actor Robert Urquhart, her co-star in &quot;Happy Ever After&quot;. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m just getting settled down into feeling that I&#x27;m ready for marriage. Before, I felt that I wasn&#x27;t ready.&quot;

In the spring of 1954, she told a journalist:
I think it is wonderful to work. I dedicate more time now than ever to study. I really like to delve deeply into the characters and the stories in order to make the most of each part I play. It seems best to remain free of any serious romantic attachments under these circumstances. I will have to meet an exceptional and understanding person, indeed, before I think of marriage. I haven&#x27;t met such a person yet.

===Marriage===

De Carlo met stuntman Robert Drew &quot;Bob&quot; Morgan on the set of &quot;Shotgun&quot; in 1955, but he was married and had a child, daughter Bari Lee, and De Carlo had &quot;no intention of causing that marriage to break up.&quot; However, they met again, after the death of Morgan&#x27;s wife, on the set of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; in Egypt, where they &quot;seemed immediately attracted to each other.&quot; They were married on November 21, 1955, at St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Reno, Nevada. De Carlo raised Bari as her own and had two sons with Morgan: Bruce Ross, whose godfather was Cecil B. DeMille; and Michael.
Bob Morgan was seriously injured and almost died while performing a stunt in the film &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962). Toward the end of the film, there is a gunfight on a moving train between the marshal and a gang of train robbers. Doubling for George Peppard, Morgan was told to hold on to a log and sway between two flatcars, one of them carrying several tons of timber. The chains holding the logs together snapped, and Morgan was crushed by the falling logs. He was so badly hurt it took him five years to recover to the point where he was able to move by himself and walk unaided. Because his contract with MGM assumed no responsibility for the accident, De Carlo and Morgan filed a $1.4 million lawsuit against the studio, claiming her husband was permanently disabled.

After the accident, De Carlo worked arduously to support her family and was often away from home, touring with stage productions or performing in nightclubs. Morgan&#x27;s constant arguing strained their marriage and De Carlo even considered divorcing her husband in 1968. When she returned home after a New Zealand tour of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, she filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. They were divorced in July 1973.

===Political views===
De Carlo, a naturalized citizen of the United States, was an active Republican who campaigned for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. In her autobiography, she recounted the time when she &quot;loved to give interviews, and enjoyed being outspoken, or &#x27;good copy,&#x27; openly discussing my survival instincts and admitting my to-the-right-of-right politics.&quot;

A conservative, she stated in a 1976 television interview with the CBC: &quot;I&#x27;m all for men and I think they ought to stay up there and be the bosses, and have women wait on them hand and foot and put their slippers on and hand them the pipe and serve seven-course meals; as long as they open the door, support the woman, and do their duty in the bedroom, et cetera.&quot;

===Religion===
De Carlo&#x27;s maternal grandparents came from distinct religious backgrounds: He was Catholic and she was Presbyterian. They raised her as an Anglican; she was a member and chorister of Vancouver&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church.

In May 1945, she told a magazine journalist that her &quot;most prized possession&quot; was a small white-leather Bible, a confirmation gift from her mother. She also revealed that the role she would like to portray most was Diana in Lloyd C. Douglas&#x27;s 1942 Christian novel &quot;The Robe&quot;.

In October 1948, a &quot;Screenland&quot; writer stated that De Carlo was &quot;doing a slow smoulder&quot; because she &quot;had her heart set on playing Delilah for C. B. De Mille&quot; in his biblical epic &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; but lost the role to Hedy Lamarr.

In 1951, during her tour of Israel, she visited the village of Cana: &quot;I saw the place where Christ turned the wine into water, and I couldn&#x27;t help but think that some film company ought to go there and make the real story of the Bible.&quot; That same year, she also expressed interest in starring in a biblical film, explaining that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing dull about the Bible.&quot;

In her autobiography, De Carlo wrote about her faith in God: &quot;God has saved me and mine from some pretty sticky situations. For me, religion is a little like being a Republican or a Democrat. It&#x27;s not the party that counts, it&#x27;s the man. Therefore, I care not what house of worship I enter, be it Catholic, Presbyterian, or Baptist. I elected God a long time ago and I&#x27;ll stick with Him, because I don&#x27;t think His term will ever be up.&quot;

=== Health and death===
De Carlo suffered a minor stroke in 1998. She later became a resident of the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, where she spent her last years. She died from heart failure on January 8, 2007, and was cremated.

<text>&quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; is the eighth episode of the first season of the American animated science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. It first aired on NBC on October 27, 1973, and was written by Larry Brody, who had originally pitched the idea for the third season of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. However, according to Brody the dialogue was mostly re-written by series creator Gene Roddenberry.

Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In this episode, while exploring the center of the galaxy, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; are transported by an alien named Lucien to the planet Megas-Tu, where magic and witchcraft are normal. Kirk and the crew are placed on trial by the inhabitants in response to the Salem Witch Trials.

The original pitch by Brody featured God rather than the Devil, but this was changed after the idea was rejected by NBC executives. Critics have written positively about the episode, praising the design work for the magical effects. It was compared to &quot;The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;, but was thought to be an improvement. Following the broadcast, a novelization of &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; was created by Alan Dean Foster, and it has been released on a variety of home media formats.

== Plot ==
While exploring near the center of the galaxy, the Federation starship &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; is caught inside an energy/matter vortex and its computer systems fail. A being named Lucien appears on the bridge, repairs the ship&#x27;s systems and takes the crew to explore his planet, Megas-Tu, on which differing physical laws allow the existence of magic and witchcraft. Suddenly fearful at the approach of other Megans, Lucien teleports the crew back onto the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to prevent their discovery.

While waiting, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew experiment with using magic. Lucien warns the crew that their experiments will draw unwanted attention, but it is too late. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew are transported to what appears to be Salem during a witch trial in 1691. The Megans are an ageless species that, at one time, lived on Earth. Contrary to modern assumption, those executed during the witch trials were all real witches, which was how the Megans were driven from Earth. The Megans put humanity and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew on trial for what humans did to their people. Captain Kirk testifies that humanity has progressed since 1691. On examining their ship&#x27;s records, the Megans conclude that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; coming to Megas-Tu was a freak accident and they need not fear human incursion. However, Lucien is condemned to eternal isolation for bringing humans to the Megans&#x27; world.

Kirk argues that this is unreasonably cruel punishment in the case of Lucien, who alone among the Megans sought out humans for companionship. The Megans claim Lucien is Lucifer, but Kirk only scoffs at this, as he does not believe in the historicity of Christian traditions, and engages the Megans in a magical battle to determine Lucien&#x27;s fate. The Megans then reveal that their threat to punish Lucien was only a test to determine if humanity had truly changed. On the basis of Kirk&#x27;s compassion, they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They return the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to its native universe.

== Production ==
In 1969, writer Larry Brody pitched a number of story ideas for the third season of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. He was unsure about how far these stories ideas were taken through the production team, and whether or not series creator Gene Roddenberry had ever seen them. Amongst the ideas was the plot that later became &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot;. Three years later in 1972, Brody was invited by producer D.C. Fontana to pitch ideas for an episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;) in the second season of &quot;The Original Series&quot; but he was unsatisfied with the effects due to the budgetary constraints.

At this point the plot concerned the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in &quot;The Original Series&quot; but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime&#x27;s executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for &quot;The Original Series&quot;.

Roddenberry took the God idea to the NBC executives, who were concerned with the &quot;blinding flash of light&quot; representing God. They rejected the inclusion of God, and the production crew realized that they needed to move the episode in the direction of magic rather than religion. Brody re-wrote the story to include the Devil instead of God. The script went through several re-writes, with Fontana and Brody meeting to discuss the changes that Roddenberry had requested. Brody later regretted not speaking to Roddenberry directly, as at times he didn&#x27;t understand what changes he was being asked to make. Fontana was aware of the controversial content of the episode, and later said that some people felt that &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; dealt with the Devil sympathetically, but believed that it was good.

Following the submission of the script, Roddenberry re-wrote the dialogue to the extent that Brody did not recognise any of it when he received the final version. However, Brody&#x27;s name remained credited on it. Afterwards, he was invited to attend the cast recording session for the episode, where he met the actors including Shatner and Nimoy. &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; was one of two episodes of &quot;The Animated Series&quot; previously pitched for live-action &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the other being David Gerrold&#x27;s &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot;. Brody later wrote the episode &quot;Tattoo&quot; for the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

== Reception and home media release ==
&quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; was first broadcast on NBC on October 27, 1973. Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, in their book &quot;Trek Navigator&quot; (1998), consider &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; to be one of the best animated episodes. They explained that while it was quite ambitious and heady for a Saturday morning children&#x27;s program, &quot;it&#x27;s somehow appropriate that &quot;Star Trek&quot; is able to pull it off successfully.&quot; They compared this episode to the live action &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; where Kirk and his crew also gain superpowers, saying it was &quot;a better episode, as Kirk pleads humanity&#x27;s case to the Megans.&quot; They highlighted that the episode depicts Kirk successfully defending Lucifer from banishment and noting that he will not fall prey to legendary superstitions. They gave the episode three out of four stars.

In his column &quot;One Trek Mind&quot; for the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website, published in December 2014, Jordan Hoffman described the episode as &quot;quite beautiful to look at&quot; but also the &quot;weirdest&quot; episode of the franchise. Hoffman said that the magical battle between Kirk and the Megan prosecutor was &quot;indescribable&quot;, and compared one scene to having Kirk &quot;trapped inside a giant wrapper of Fruit Stripe gum&quot;. He thought that the revelation of Lucien as the Devil and the punchline ending to the episode could not be repeated in modern television.

In January 2014, Witney Seibold when writing for CraveOnline, said that &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; was the best episode of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;. Seibold said that it opened up a number of questions, such as &quot;Does the most evil creature in existence deserve rights as an individual?&quot;, and added that the action sequence where Captain Kirk fires lightning out of his hands was &quot;really cool&quot;. However, Michelle Erica Green in her March 2011 review for TrekNation described the episode as so bad that she thought fans only watched it to play drinking games. Following her review, she planned to return to pretending that the &quot;terrible&quot; &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; never existed at all.

The episode was expanded by Alan Dean Foster in the novel &quot;Star Trek: Log 3&quot; alongside the episodes &quot;Once Upon a Planet&quot; and &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Passion&quot;. &quot;The Magicks of Megas-tu&quot; was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set. The first release of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; on DVD was through fan made productions. The official DVD release was on November 21, 2006 in the United States, which was a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show.

<doc id="695914" wikidata="Q17108414" url="?curid=695914" title="Eveready Battery Company">
<text>Eveready Battery Company, Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric battery brands &quot;Eveready&quot; and &quot;Energizer&quot;, owned by Energizer Holdings. Its headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri.

The predecessor company began in 1890 in New York and was renamed in 1905. Today, the company makes batteries in the United States and China and has production facilities around the world.

==History==

In 1896, Russian immigrant Conrad Hubert founded the American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company to market battery powered devices. On January 10, 1899, the company obtained U.S. Patent No. 617,592 (filed March 12, 1898) from David Misell, an inventor. This &quot;electric device&quot; designed by Misell was powered by &quot;D&quot; batteries laid front-to-back in a paper tube with the light bulb and a rough brass reflector at the end. Misell, the inventor of the tubular hand-held &quot;electric device&quot; (flashlight), assigned his invention over to the American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company owned by Conrad Hubert. 

In 1905, Hubert changed the name again to &quot;The American Ever Ready Company&quot;, selling flashlights and batteries under the trademark &quot;Ever Ready&quot;. In 1906 the British Ever Ready Electrical Company (BEREC) was formed for export of batteries; it became independent in 1914. In 1907, Ever Ready announced AA dry cell, and in 1911 it developed AAA dry cell.

In 1914, The American Ever Ready Company became part of National Carbon Company. Hubert stayed on as the president. The trademark was shortened to &quot;Eveready&quot;. Under National Carbon, the company continued to market various tubular flashlights, flask-shaped pocket lights, fountainpen flashlights, lighted clocks, lanterns, electric candles, cap and lapel lights, search lights, pistol lights, gas and range lighters, and tungsten batteries. In 1917, National Carbon Company merged with Union Carbide to form the Union Carbide and Carbon Company. From 1917 until 1921, Eveready used the trademark &quot;DAYLO&quot; for their flashlights and on their batteries. Into the 1930s, it sold &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; and &quot;C&quot; radio batteries, Columbia Dry Batteries, and flashlight batteries. B batteries were sold under the Layerbilt name. 

In 1937, a South African operation was established in Port Elizabeth. By 1949, BEREC acquired the concern.

In 1957, employees Lewis Urry, Paul Marsal, and Karl Kordesch invented a long-lasting alkaline battery using a zinc/manganese dioxide chemistry while working for Union Carbide&#x27;s Cleveland plant. The company did not aggressively market the invention, however, and instead continued to market the zinc–carbon battery. As a result, the company lost significant market share to Duracell. 

Union Carbide Kenya Limited., based in Kenya, was established in 1967 to manufacturer and market Eveready batteries in Africa. It was renamed to Eveready Batteries Kenya Limited in 1986 and to Eveready East Africa Limited in 2004.

Prior to March 1, 1980, the company&#x27;s alkaline battery had been called the Eveready Alkaline Battery (1959–1968), Eveready Alkaline Energizer (1968–1974) and Eveready Alkaline Power Cell (1974–February 29, 1980). On March 1, 1980, it was rebadged under its current name, Energizer.

In 1986, Union Carbide sold its Battery Products Division to Ralston Purina Company for $1.4 billion. After the transfer, the division was named Eveready Battery Company, Inc., becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Ralston Purina. By the end of 1987, Eveready held 58-60% percent market share, but that number had fallen to 40-45% by 1989 thanks to competition from Duracell. In December 1988, Eveready&#x27;s European unit acquired Cofinea, a French company that made Wonder and Mazda batteries.

Eveready announced its first lithium AA battery in 1988 and began selling it in December 1992. The company introduced its first mercury-free Battery in 1990. 

In 1992, it bought the British Ever Ready Electrical Company (manufacturer of Gold Seal and Silver Seal batteries) from Hanson Trust, bringing its former subsidiary back under common ownership. Hanson retained its South African division at the time but ultimately sold it to Duracell in 1996.

By December 1998, Eveready&#x27;s market share had fallen to 30% against Duracell&#x27;s 50%. In June 1999, Ralston Purina announced it would spin off the Eveready business. By September, it was announced that Eveready would sell its rechargeable battery division, though it retained a minority stake. 

Ralston completed its spin off Eveready in April 2000. The business unit was renamed Energizer Holdings, Inc., with Eveready Battery Company, Inc continuing as a subsidiary.

==Facilities==
The company&#x27;s initial factory opened in the 1890s and was located near Edgewater Park in Cleveland, Ohio. The manufacturing plant was closed in 1978 and all operations shut down in 1997. The site was put up for sale in 1999 and later turned into the Battery Park housing development. 

Eveready inherited its Fremont, Ohio plant when National Carbon Company acquired the company in 1914. The facility produced hearing aid batteries, aluminum-air batteries, C and D zinc-carbon batteries, and six-inch dry cell batteries at various times. It was closed in March 1998 following the decline in demand for zinc-carbon batteries. 

Eveready opened a plant in Bennington, Vermont in 1942 and a facility in St. Albans in 1947. The St. Albans plant closed in 2013. After nearly 80 years of operation, it was announced in October 2019 that the Bennington facility would close. Production operations moved to a new facility in Portage, Wisconsin. 

In 1967, Union Carbide opened an electrolytic manganese dioxide plant in Marietta, Ohio. Three ferromanganese-alloy furnace departments were sold in 1981. A fire in April 1987 kept the facility closed for over a year.

In 1971, Eveready opened a facility in Maryville, Missouri. It was underwent five expansions from 1973 to 1997 before ultimately closing in 2013 due to a drop in demand of disposable batteries.

The company also maintained facilities in Asheboro, North Carolina; Marietta, Ohio; and Westlake, Ohio. The majority of batteries are made in China. There are also numerous production facilities outside the US.

==Advertising==

In the 1920s, the company sponsored &quot;The Eveready Hour&quot; on radio.

In 1941, after the United States entered World War II, the slogan changed to &quot;Change your batteries, get a nickel!&quot; to encourage economic growth.

In the 1970s, actor Robert Conrad was the spokesman for Eveready Alkaline Power Cells, in which he compared his tough physique to the performance of the battery placed on his shoulder, and daring someone to knock it off.

In the early 1980s, it utilized the slogan, &quot;Energized, for life!&quot;, showing people using Energizers in everyday situations.

In 1985, the company highlighted an advertising campaign best known for Mary Lou Retton averring: &quot;It&#x27;s supercharged!&quot;

In the late 1980s, there was an Australian advertising campaign featuring Mark &#x27;Jacko&#x27; Jackson and his pitch line &quot;Energizer! It&#x27;ll surprise you! Oi!&quot;.

Since 1988, the well-known Energizer Bunny has been featured in its television ads. The bunny was based on the similar Duracell Bunny. Initially, ads had the Energizer Bunny interrupting what seemed like other brands&#x27; commercials. Later, the bunny would appear in competition with inferior rival battery Supervolt, which was based on Duracell. In 1991, it made the jump to print advertising. Outside the United States and Canada, the company uses an anthropomorphic AA battery named Mr. Energizer as its mascot.

Both the Eveready and Energizer marks are used under license by auto parts magnate Pep Boys for their in-house car batteries. The Energizer logo used by Pep Boys is similar to the 1980s-era logo first used with the consumer dry cell batteries.

Both Eveready and Energizer are marketed as different brands in some markets in Asia. This has led to the availability of both &quot;Eveready Gold&quot; Alkaline batteries and Energizer Alkaline batteries on store shelves. However, both target different market segments and Eveready batteries tend to be marketed for lower end devices, while Energizer batteries are marketed for power-hungry devices and are priced accordingly.

<doc id="695915" wikidata="Q11774134" url="?curid=695915" title="More Tribbles, More Troubles">
<text>&quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; is the fifth episode of the first season of the animated American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on October 6, 1973, and was written by David Gerrold as a sequel to his &quot;Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;. It features actor Stanley Adams reprising his role of trader Cyrano Jones, and the return of the fuzzy, rapidly reproducing creatures called tribbles.

In this episode, Kirk must figure out why the Klingons are trying to get a hold of Cyrano Jones while simultaneously protecting two automated grain carriers.

== Plot ==
While the Federation starship &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; escorts two robot cargo ships carrying quintotriticale, a new seed grain, to famine-stricken Sherman&#x27;s Planet, it encounters a Klingon battlecruiser, commanded by Captain Koloth, firing on a Federation scout ship. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; beams the pilot aboard. The Klingons use a new energy weapon which incapacitates the starship, and demand they hand over the pilot. First Officer Spock hypothesizes that such a powerful weapon must require all the Klingon ship&#x27;s energy, and Lt. Uhura notices that the two cargo ships have not been disabled. Captain Kirk has the cargo ships set a course to ram into the Klingon ship. With their energy expended, the Klingon ship is forced to flee, but damages one of the cargo ships. Since the &quot;Enterprise&quot; cargo hold lacks sufficient space, the crew must dangerously load the ship&#x27;s decks with the grain.

The pilot is Cyrano Jones, an interstellar trader well known to Kirk and crew. He got out of his task of cleaning up the tribbles on Space Station K-7 using a glommer, which preys on tribbles. Jones is now selling &quot;safe&quot; tribbles genetically engineered to be sterile. The Klingons attack again, disabling the engines of the remaining cargo ship and bathing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in a radiation which rapidly increases the growth of the tribbles aboard. Kirk still refuses to hand over Jones, ostensibly because he is a Federation citizen, but actually because he suspects the Klingons would not have violated Federation space unless Jones were of great value to them. The Klingons again use their new weapon. Kirk responds by having the tribbles beamed over to their ship.

Now at a disadvantage, Koloth admits that Klingon planets are being overrun by tribbles sold by Jones. The glommer, which was created by the Klingons via genetic engineering and stolen by Jones, is their only hope of controlling them. Kirk returns it, but the huge tribbles scare it away. Koloth orders his first officer to shoot the large tribble, only to inadvertently free smaller ones inside. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, having discovered in advance that the large tribbles are actually tribble colonies, injects the remaining tribbles on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with a serum to slow down their metabolic rate.

== Production ==
Originally pitched as a third season follow up to &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, the idea was scrapped under the tenure of producer Fred Freiberger, who was not a fan of the original episode and did not want to produce comedy episodes.

In 1973, Gerrold and &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer D. C. Fontana were appearing on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention circuit together. Fontana was executive producer of the new &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;; Gerrold offered to write an episode and Fontana responded that she was interested in a tribble sequel.

As with his other &quot;Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Bem&quot;, Gerrold later claimed that almost nothing was cut from the original pitches for &quot;The Original Series&quot; as animation played out quicker and so everything still fit into the episode despite the reduced running time.

Both of Gerrold&#x27;s episodes written for the &quot;Animated Series&quot; were later novelized by Alan Dean Foster, and Gerrold said that he thought that Foster did &quot;a fine job&quot;.

== Reception ==
A &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, recommended this episode as part of the &quot;foundations of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot; group. &quot;CBR&quot; rated &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; the 9th funniest episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, commenting, &quot;It’s a good balance of action and comedy as once more, the Tribbles are used as weapons.&quot;

== Home media releases ==
The &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; season 2 remastered DVD set also included special features for &#x27;Tribbles&#x27;, including original series episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; and the episodes &quot;Trials and Tribblations&quot; from &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;More Tribbles, More Trouble&quot; from &quot;TAS&quot;.

On November 15, 2016 &quot;More Tribbles, More Troubles&quot; was released on HD on Blu-Ray as part of the complete &quot;TAS&quot; box set.

<doc id="695917" wikidata="Q2824495" url="?curid=695917" title="Dirac adjoint">
<text>In quantum field theory, the Dirac adjoint defines the dual operation of a Dirac spinor. The Dirac adjoint is motivated by the need to form well-behaved, measurable quantities out of Dirac spinors, replacing the usual role of the Hermitian adjoint.

Possibly to avoid confusion with the usual Hermitian adjoint, some textbooks do not provide a name for the Dirac adjoint but simply call it &quot;ψ-bar&quot;.

== Definition ==

Let formula_1 be a Dirac spinor. Then its Dirac adjoint is defined as

:formula_2

where formula_3 denotes the Hermitian adjoint of the spinor formula_1, and formula_5 is the time-like gamma matrix.

== Spinors under Lorentz transformations ==

The Lorentz group of special relativity is not compact, therefore spinor representations of Lorentz transformations are generally not unitary. That is, if formula_6 is a projective representation of some Lorentz transformation,

:formula_7,

then, in general,

:formula_8.

The Hermitian adjoint of a spinor transforms according to

:formula_9.

Therefore, formula_10 is not a Lorentz scalar and formula_11 is not even Hermitian.

Dirac adjoints, in contrast, transform according to

:formula_12.

Using the identity formula_13, the transformation reduces to

:formula_14,

Thus, formula_15 transforms as a Lorentz scalar and formula_16 as a four-vector.

== Usage ==

Using the Dirac adjoint, the probability four-current J for a spin-1/2 particle field can be written as

:formula_17

where c is the speed of light and the components of J represent the probability density ρ and the probability 3-current j:

:formula_18.

Taking and using the relation for gamma matrices

:formula_19,

the probability density becomes

:formula_20.

<doc id="695919" wikidata="Q6436911" url="?curid=695919" title="Krewe of Endymion">
<text>The Krewe of Endymion is a New Orleans Mardi Gras super krewe and social organization.

== History and formation ==
The Krewe of Endymion is one of only three Super Krewes (using floats and celebrity Grand Marshals), and is the largest of the parades participating in the New Orleans Mardi Gras. Many people begin saving their viewing spots for this parade several days before the parade actually rolls, although spot-saving is widely frowned upon and is discouraged. It was founded in 1966 and named after Endymion {en-dim&#x27;-ee-uhn}, from Greek mythology. The first ball was held in 1968.

==Parade==

The first Endymion parade rolled on February 4, 1967 in the Gentilly neighborhood near the New Orleans Fair Grounds horse racing facility. The parade remained on its original route until 1976, when it was shifted to its now traditional Mid-City route, rolling from Orleans Avenue to North Carrollton Avenue to Canal Street and into the Caesar&#x27;s Superdome.

The 1979 parade was moved to the Jefferson Parish suburb of Kenner due to a strike by the New Orleans Police Department which forced the cancellation of a large number of parades within the city, including fellow super krewe Bacchus and all of the old-line parades, led by Rex, King of Carnival and the Mistick Krewe of Comus.

The 2003 parade was forced to the Uptown route along St. Charles Avenue by construction of the Canal Streetcar Line, a circumstance which repeated in 2006 and 2007 due to a lack of manpower within the NOPD in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Endymion returned to Mid-City in 2008 and is the only remaining parade in the New Orleans city limits which does not use the Uptown route.

On February 25, 2017, an impaired driver injured between 28 and 32 people when his pickup truck hit two cars and a parade crowd and crashed into a dump truck. Terrorism was quickly ruled out when a breathalyzer test was three times over the legal driving limit.

On March 2, 2019, an impaired driver killed two people and injured seven others when he plowed through a bicycle lane during the parade.

On February 22, 2020, the parade was halted and cancelled after 13 floats, after a spectator was struck and killed between the halves of a tandem float. Following the incident, as well as a similar death during the Nyx parade earlier in the week, the city of New Orleans banned interconnected floats from the remaining Mardi Gras parades that year. Parades were canceled in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As parades resume in 2022, the city may require further safety measures surrounding tandem floats.

===Celebrity Grand Marshals and Performers===

New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson was Grand Marshal of the 2010 parade only six days following his franchise&#x27;s victory in Super Bowl XLIV over the Indianapolis Colts. Benson was the first celebrity Grand Marshal not from the entertainment industry. 

The parade was not held in 2021; it was planned the next year for Saturday February 26, 2022, before Mardi Gras on Tuesday March 1, 2022.

=== Throws ===
Its motto, &quot;Throw Until It Hurts&quot;, defines a tradition of being extremely generous with its throws, tossing millions of beads, cups, doubloons and s during its annual parade, held the Saturday before Mardi Gras.

==Parade Theme==

Unlike many other Carnival Krewes, Endymion announces the season theme months prior to Mardi Gras.

===Parade Themes===
==Samedi Gras==
Samedi Gras is the Endymion pre-parade block party located between Carrollton and City Park Avenue. Samedi Gras begins at noon on parade day. The Captain and riding celebrities arrive early and address the crowds and the Endymion Parade begins shortly after.

==Endymion Extravaganza==

The parade is immediately followed with a party called the &quot;Endymion Extravaganza&quot;. It was held from 1974 to 1980 at the now demolished Rivergate Convention Center. Since 1981, it has been held in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, except in 2006 when it was held at the New Orleans Morial Convention Center due to repairs to the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina; 2011 due to ongoing renovations; and 2023 and 2024 due to extensive renovations in advance of Super Bowl LIX. The Krewe is scheduled to return the Extravangza to the Superdome after its March 1, 2025 parade. During the 2010s, the Krewe has had over 3000 members and over 20,000 guests at its Extravaganza.
