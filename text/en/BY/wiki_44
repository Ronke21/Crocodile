<text>The town of Crafers is in the Adelaide Hills to the south-east of Adelaide, South Australia, considered to be an outer suburb of Adelaide.

== History ==

Crafers was named after David Crafer, who arrived in Adelaide in 1838 and moved to the area. With his wife he established an inn, the Sawyers Arms, in 1839 three years after the colony of South Australia was created. He then built the Norfolk Arms on in 1840 with banquet seating for 150. He moved to Adelaide and sold the Norfolk Arms in 1842, at which point it was known as The Crafers Inn. A new hotel was built on the site in 1880, remaining into the 21st century as The Crafers Inn, but the original building was burned down in 1926. At the time the area at the foot of nearby Mount Lofty was known as the Tiers, infamous for being the haunt of numerous Tiersmen and woodcutters on the run from authorities in Adelaide.

The historic Crafers Primary School was first established in the area in 1865 by Mr Edward Smith. The school was initially located in small premises in Atkinson Road, and then moved to its present location in Piccadilly Road in 1928. The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley-Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975.

The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott.

For many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne. It wasn&#x27;t until 2000 that the Heysen Tunnels project was completed to extend the freeway to Glen Osmond on the outskirts of Adelaide. Prior to the tunnel opening, the winding road from Adelaide to Glen Osmond via Eagle On The Hill was frequently the scene of horrific vehicle accidents, often involving semi-trailers.

The Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is nestled in the hills behind Crafers. The gardens, opened in 1977, include an extensive mix of European and Australian native plants and are at their finest in the spring months.

On 16 February 1983, Crafers was hard hit by the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Many homes adjacent to bushland on the western side of the suburb were destroyed (as well as the Anglican theological college and priory of St Michael&#x27;s House) as the fire came roaring out of the then Cleland National Park, and the devastation would have been much worse if a change in weather had not occurred right when the township of Crafers itself was being threatened. A memorial on Mount Lofty Summit is dedicated to those in the Adelaide Hills who lost their lives that day.

Crafers is under the administration of the Adelaide Hills Council, and is in the state electoral district of Bragg and the federal electorate of Mayo. Crafers West is in the state electoral district of Heysen.

<text>Viktor Fyodorovich Markin (; born 23 February 1957 in the village of Oktyabrsky, Ust-Tarksky District, Novosibirsk Oblast) is a former Soviet athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

After graduating from a secondary school he went to Novosibirsk, where he entered the Faculty of Pediatrics of the Institute of Medicine. Markin started athletics only at age 19 in the athletics section by the institute, coached by Aleksandr Bukhasheyev. He remained quite unknown until the Moscow Olympic Games.

On 27 April 1980, in Sochi, Markin ran a new personal best in the one lap event of 46.96 seconds. In early July Markin ran 45.34 at the Central Lenin Stadium. In the Olympic final on July 30, Markin was only fifth at the halfway mark and as the final straight opened he was still three metres behind the leader Frank Schaffer of East Germany. But with a very strong finish Markin won with a European record and world season best 44.60 (still the Russian national record over 400 m). Markin captured his second gold in the 4 × 400 m relay when, as an anchor, he outran the winner of the 400 metre hurdles, East German Volker Beck.

After a break from sports to complete his studies in medicine, Markin returned at the European Championships in 1982, where he won two bronze medals (400 m and 4 × 400 m relay). At the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki Markin, the only Soviet competing in the individual 400 metres (as the rest were concentrating on the relay), was knocked out of the final in an extremely close photo finish by eventual bronze medalist Sunder Nix of the United States. However, he finished on a high note as in the last event of the Championships, the 4 × 400 m relay, the Soviets won an unexpected gold. West Germany already lost their winning chances on the first leg as Erwin Skamrahl (who had broken Markin&#x27;s European record just three weeks earlier) gave up more than ten meters to Sergey Lovachov; the other main favorites, United States, hung with the Soviets for two and a half legs until Willie Smith tumbled and fell, leaving Markin an easy job to anchor home a USSR victory.

Markin decided to retire after hearing the Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="705540" wikidata="Q11211553" url="?curid=705540" title="Attack on the Moncada Barracks">
<text>The Moncada Barracks were military barracks in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba named after General Guillermo Moncada, a hero of the Cuban War of Independence. On 26 July 1953, the barracks was the site of an armed attack by a small group of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. That day a simultaneous attack was carried out on the Carlos M. de Cespedes Barracks in Bayamo directed by Raúl Martínez Ararás by order of Castro. The attack failed and the surviving revolutionaries were imprisoned. This armed attack is widely accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. The date on which the attack took place, 26 July, was adopted by Castro as the name for his revolutionary movement, Movimiento 26 Julio (abbreviated as M-26-7), which eventually toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista on 1 January 1959.

==Preparation==
Almost all of Fidel Castro&#x27;s followers were Partido Ortodoxo Youth rank and file of the lower middle class and working class. Of the 137 insurgents whose ages are known, the average age was 26, the same as that of Castro. Nine rebels were in their teens, 96 were in their twenties, 27 in their thirties, and five over 40. The Afro-Cuban composition of the group was limited to two Africans and 12 Cubans of partial African ancestry, partly because most biracial Cubans identified with Batista, who was of mixed blood. Only two of the group were women, Haydée Santamaría and Melba Hernández, both of whom went on to become politicians.

After Batista&#x27;s military coup on 10 March 1952, Fidel Castro and his group began to train young men to engage in the struggle, along with other anti-Batista groups, against an illegitimate government. Castro claimed that they trained 1,200 men within a few months, training at the University of Havana and at firing ranges in Havana, disguising themselves as businessmen interested in hunting and clay pigeon shooting.

The weapons included 40 12- and 16-gauge shotguns, 35 Mosberg and Remington .22 rifles, 60 handguns of various models, a malfunctioning .45 caliber submachine gun, 24 rifles of different caliber, including eight Model 1898 Krag–Jørgensen rifles, a .30-06 Model 1903 Springfield rifle, three sawed-off 1892 .44-caliber Winchester rifles, and a .30 caliber M1 Garand rifle with a folding metal stock.

Fidel Castro decided that army uniforms were needed for the Moncada attack. He discussed this with Calabazar cell leader Pedro Trigo Lopez , who suggested approaching his relative Florentino Fernandez Leon, a 26-year-old military hospital orderly in Jaimanitas. Fernandez agreed and received $200 to purchase surplus uniforms, weapons, and ammunition. He then pilfered from the military hospital laundry most of the blue uniforms needed to attire the rebels.

The night before the attack, the men gathered at a farm in Siboney, where they learned what the objective was. The plan was to secure the barracks and gain possession of the weapons stored within, and to use the building&#x27;s army communications equipment to spread false messages for several hours to confuse the military. In the meantime, the weapons would be removed and hidden throughout the city to use in the continuing struggle, and Santiago&#x27;s radio station would be taken to broadcast the speeches of Eduardo Chibás, in order to mobilize the public with the ultimate aim of bringing down the Batista government. 

The men left the farm at 4:45 am on 26 July 1953, planning to attack at dawn. The date of the attack was specifically chosen because the &quot;fiestas&quot; in Santiago are held on 25 July.

==The attack==
On 26 July 1953, at 5:15 am, Fidel Castro led a group of 136 rebels (with an additional 24 intending to take the barracks at Bayamo), including his brother Raúl, in an attack on the second largest military garrison; commanded by Colonel Alberto del Rio Chaviano.

The group formed a 16-automobile caravan in order to give the appearance of being a delegation headed by a high-ranking officer sent from western Cuba. Their plan was that a first group of 25 men led by Abel Santamaría would take the civilian hospital at the rear of the barracks, a second group of 6 men led by Lester Rodriguez, including Raúl Castro (Fidel&#x27;s brother), would take the Audiencia Building (Palacio de Justicia), and a third group of 90 men, led by Castro, would take the barracks, including the radio transmitter within it.

The attack began poorly. The caravan of automobiles became separated by the time it arrived at the barracks, and the car carrying the guerillas&#x27; heavy weapons got lost. Furthermore, many of the rebels who would have taken part in the attack were left behind for a lack of weapons. In Castro&#x27;s autobiography, he claims that he drove his car into a group of soldiers at the gate who had realized an attack was in progress. The men in the cars behind him jumped out of their cars, believing they were inside the barracks, and the alarm was sounded before the barracks had been infiltrated. According to Castro, this was the fatal mistake in the operation. 

Fifteen soldiers and three policemen were killed and 23 soldiers and five policemen wounded during the attack to the Moncada Barracks. Nine rebels were killed in combat, 11 wounded, four of them by friendly fire, and 42 executed later. In the attack on Carlos M. de Cespedes Barracks, one soldier died and two were wounded. Later the Cuban Army executed ten fugitive attackers. (According to Fidel Castro five were killed in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, and 56 were executed later by the Batista regime in the attack on the Moncada Barracks and the Bayamo Barracks) Eighteen rebels captured in the Civil Hospital were immediately executed in the Moncada small-arms target range within two hours after the attack. Their corpses were strewn throughout the garrison to simulate death in combat. Thirty-four fleeing rebels captured during the next three days were murdered after admitting their participation. A handful of rebels, including Fidel Castro, escaped into the nearby countryside but were apprehended shortly thereafter.

== Trial ==

The Santiago de Cuba Urgency Tribunal indicted 122 defendants in Case 37 of 1953 to stand trial for 26 July insurrection. Fifty-one of the 99 rebel survivors who were captured were remanded for trial. Six indicted rebels remained in hiding. The other 65 defendants implicated throughout the island were mostly political leaders and opposition activists not involved in the rebellion. Fifteen of them, including deposed President Carlos Prío Socarrás, Aureliano Sánchez Arango, José Pardo Llada, and Communist leader Blas Roca, were underground or in exile and never went to court.

The trial in the Santiago de Cuba Palace of Justice began on 21 September 1953 and ended on 6 October 1953, after 11 sessions. The Cuban Civil Code of Justice, based on the Napoleonic Code practiced in Europe and Latin America, has the verdict determined by a panel of three judges rather than by a jury of peers as under &quot;common law&quot; in the U.S. and Great Britain. In accordance, after the accused heard the charges against them, they were called to testify on their own behalf. The defendants were represented by 24 attorneys. Fidel Castro assumed his own defense and lied under oath to avoid implicating rebels on trial. During the questioning of rebel witnesses, Castro raised accusations of the murder of prisoners by the military. In consequence, Moncada chief Col. Alberto del Rio Chaviano, impeded Castro from returning to court by claiming that he could not attend due to illness. The tribunal then separated Castro from the proceedings and granted him a separate trial. Nineteen rebels were found not guilty based on lack of evidence and their false testimony. Confessed leaders Raúl Castro, Oscar Alcalde, Pedro Miret, and Ernesto Tizol received 13-year prison sentences. Twenty other rebels received 10-year sentences. Rebels Manuel Lorenzo, Eduardo Rodriguez, and Orlando Cortez Gallardo, who refused to participate in the attack at the last moment, got three-year sentences. Dr. Melba Hernandez Rodriguez del Rey and Haydée Santamaría were given seven-month sentences since it was never proven that they handled weapons.

Castro, a qualified lawyer, used his time in prison to write a speech entitled &quot;History Will Absolve Me&quot;, which included part of his defense statement delivered during his sentencing; he received a 15-year sentence. A copy of the speech was smuggled page by page out of prison (Presidio Modelo). A friend from the 26 July attack, Haydée Santamaría later published it.

==Aftermath==

Two years later, in 1955, the mothers of some prisoners launched a campaign to free Castro and the other rebels imprisoned with him. As popular support for the rebels and opposition to Batista&#x27;s rule mounted, a group of political leaders, editors, and intellectuals signed a public appeal demanding liberty for the prisoners. That year, the Cuban Congress passed a bill granting general amnesty to political prisoners. After the bill was signed by Batista, the 30 imprisoned rebels were freed. They served 22 months in prison.

The battle damage to the Moncada barracks was quickly repaired by the military. After the revolution, it was converted into a school on January 28, 1960. Three weeks earlier, Fidel Castro personally drove the bulldozer that demolished the crenelated outer walls. In 1978, Castro ordered the massive perimeter walls rebuilt and converted half of the main building into the July 26 Historical Museum.

<doc id="705545" wikidata="Q581070" url="?curid=705545" title="Coat of arms of Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>The coat of arms of Newfoundland and Labrador was originally granted by Garter King of Arms, during the reign of King Charles I, on 1 January 1637/8.

==History==
On 13 November 1637, &quot;all that whole Continent Island or Region commonly called NEWFOUNDLAND&quot; was granted to David Kirke, Governor of Newfoundland from 1638 to 1651, James Marquess Hamilton, Phillip Earle of Pembroke &amp; Montgomery and Henry Earle of Holland. On 1 January 1638, it was deemed that a coat of arms was necessary &quot;for the greater honor and splendor of that Countrey and the people therein inhabiting.&quot;
The original grant describes the arms as follows:I have accordingly for the purpose before recited devised sett forth and contrived the Armes &amp; Ensignes hereafter described. That is to say Gules a Grosse Argent In the first Quarter of the Escocheon a Lyon Passant gardant Crowned Or In the second an Unicorne passant of the second armed maned and unguled of the third gorged with a Crowne whereunto is affixed a chaine passing between his fore leggs and reflexed over his back of the last. In the third as in the second. In the fourth as in the first And for the Creast Upon an Healme Mantled Gules doobled Argent and a Wreath Or &amp; Gules an Elke passant pper The Escocheon supported by two Savages of the Clyme pper armed and apparaled according to their Guise when they goe to Warre And Under all in an Escroll this Motto Quaerite prime Regnum Dei as in the Margent more plainly is depicted.

Not long after receiving this grant, a civil war broke out in England. Kirke was a Royalist and on the losing side of the war. Kirke was arrested and died in The Clink in Southwark around the end of January 1654 and the coat of arms granted him was forgotten. It was not used for over 200 years and it appears its existence was unknown to both the Newfoundland and United Kingdom authorities.

Instead, the colony used as its Great Seal both the Royal coat of arms and a design which was approved in 1820 and which incorporated a badge depicting the figure of Mercury, the classical god of commerce, presenting to Britannia a fisherman who, kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of the sea. Below this, the Latin words &quot;Haec Tibi Dona Fero&quot; meaning &quot;These gifts I bring thee&quot; appear, and written around the circumference of the seal is &quot;Sigillum Terrae Novae Insulae&quot; meaning &quot;Seal of the Island of Terra Nova&quot;.

In 1893, D.W. Prowse published &quot;A History of Newfoundland&quot;, in which he printed a copy of the Newfoundland arms. Prowse erroneously attributed the armorial bearings to John Guy, and described the image as the arms of the &quot;London and Bristol Company for Colonising Newfoundland&quot;. The Newfoundland Post Office perpetuated his error by issuing a 1910 two-cent stamp depicting the arms and included attribution to the London and Bristol Company, which financed Guy&#x27;s colonization attempt.

Following the First World War, the Imperial War Graves Commission requested to know which arms should be used on memorials in French cathedrals commemorating Newfoundland&#x27;s involvement. Newfoundland&#x27;s High Commissioner in England, Sir Edgar Bowring began the search, but it was his successor, Captain Victor Gordon, who received confirmation from the College of Arms in London that the Kirke coat of arms belonged to Newfoundland. In 1928 the government of the Dominion of Newfoundland officially adopted this coat of arms. It has been in use ever since, despite the changes in Newfoundland&#x27;s status from Dominion to a colony run by the Commission of Government in 1934, and subsequently to a province of Canada in 1949. The &quot;Coat of Arms Act&quot; (RSNL 1990, chapter C-20, as amended) provides the current legal authority for the use of the arms.

==Symbolism==
Crest
:An Moose appears standing on a wreath of gold and red to represent Newfoundland&#x27;s wildlife.

Escutcheon
:Two silver unicorns and two gold lions occupy opposing quadrants of the shield. This part of the coat of arms recalls the royal beasts which appear as supporters on the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The lion represents England and the unicorn represents Scotland.
Compartment
:A mossy knoll.

Supporters
:The two supporters are fanciful interpretations of the Beothuk, an Indigenous group from the island of Newfoundland.

Motto
:&quot;Quaerite prime Regnum Dei&quot;, quoting Matthew 6:33 from the Bible, &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of God&quot;.

==Redesign==
Starting in the 2010s, the coat of arms has been criticized for its portrayal of indigenous peoples. In 2016, Indigenous artist Jordan Bennett produced a newly commissioned artwork &quot;tamiow tle’owin&quot; for the &quot;With Secrecy and Despatch&quot; exhibition at the Campbelltown Art Centre, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia. The piece focuses on the Newfoundland and Labrador coat of arms and is, according to the artist&#x27;s statement, &quot;a commentary on the exotification, exploitation, and commodification of Indigenous cultures.&quot;

In 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador government confirmed its plan to redesign the province&#x27;s coat of arms, in response to the province&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples Commission&#x27;s call for changes in the name of reconciliation. Randy Edmunds, MHA for Labrador&#x27;s Torngat Mountains and parliamentary secretary for Indigenous Affairs, noted at the same time that elk are not native to Newfoundland and Labrador, and suggested it be replaced with a caribou.

News of a potential redesign spawned media polls and tongue-in-cheek suggestions. It also spurred a satirical response from Indigenous newspaper columnist and Qalipu First Nation Councilor Andy Barker.

In June 2021, following the possible discovery of unmarked graves in the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, Premier Andrew Furey announced that the government had issued a formal notice to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly to begin the redesign process.

<doc id="705553" wikidata="Q5299235" url="?curid=705553" title="Dosage Index">
<text>The Dosage Index is a mathematical figure used by breeders of Thoroughbred race horses, and sometimes by bettors handicapping horse races, to quantify a horse&#x27;s ability, or inability, to negotiate the various distances at which horse races are run. It is calculated based on an analysis of the horse&#x27;s pedigree.

==History==
Interest in determining which sires of race horses transmit raw speed, and which sires transmit stamina (defined as the ability to successfully compete at longer distances) to their progeny dates back to the early 20th century, when a French researcher, Lt. Col. J. J. Vuillier, published a study on the subject (called Dosage), which was subsequently modified by an Italian breeding expert, Dr. Franco Varola, in two books he authored, entitled &quot;Typology Of The Race Horse&quot; and &quot;The Functional Development Of The Thoroughbred&quot;.

However, these observations attracted little interest from the general public until 1981, when &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; breeding columnist Leon Rasmussen published a new version of Dosage developed by an American scientist and horse owner, Steven A. Roman, Ph.D., in his analysis of the upcoming Kentucky Derby for that year. The new approach, which was more accessible to owners, breeders and handicappers and was supported by solid statistical data, rapidly caught on, and the term &quot;Dosage Index&quot; has been a fixture in the lexicon of horse racing ever since. The details of Dosage methodology have been summarized in Dr. Roman&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Dosage: Pedigree &amp; Performance&quot; published in 2002.

==Method==
The index itself is compiled by noting the presence of certain influential sires, known as &quot;chefs-de-race&quot; (French for &quot;chiefs of racing&quot;, or, more esoterically, &quot;masters of the breed&quot;) in the first four generations of a horse&#x27;s pedigree. Based on what distances the progeny of the sires so designated excelled in during their racing careers (the distance preferences displayed by the sires themselves while racing being irrelevant), each chef-de-race (the list released in the early 1980s identified 120 such sires, there are 232 horses on the list) is placed in one or two of the following categories, or &quot;aptitudinal groups&quot;: Brilliant, Intermediate, Classic, Solid or Professional, with &quot;Brilliant&quot; indicating that the sire&#x27;s progeny fared best at very short distances and &quot;Professional&quot; denoting a propensity for very long races on the part of the sire&#x27;s offspring, the other three categories ranking along the same continuum in the aforementioned order. If a chef-de-race is placed in two different aptitudinal groups, in no case can the two groups be more than two positions apart; for example, Classic-Solid or Brilliant-Classic are permissible, but Brilliant-Solid, Intermediate-Professional and Brilliant-Professional are not.

If a horse&#x27;s sire is on the chef-de-race list, it counts 16 points for the group to which the sire belongs (or eight in each of two categories if the sire was placed in two groups); a grandsire counts eight points, a great-grandsire four, and a great-great-grandsire two (female progenitors do not count directly, but if any of their sires etc. are on the chef-de-race list points would accrue via such sires).

This results in a Dosage Profile consisting of five separate figures, listed in order of Brilliant-Intermediate-Classic-Solid-Professional. Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, for example, had a Dosage Profile of 20-14-7-9-0. To arrive at the Dosage Index, the first two figures plus one-half the value of the third figure are added together, and then divided by one-half of the third figure plus the sum of the last two figures. In this case, it would be 37.5 (20 + 14+ 3.5) divided by 12.5 (3.5 + 9 + 0), giving Secretariat a Dosage Index of exactly 3.00 (the figure almost always being expressed with two places to the right of the decimal point and rounded to the nearest 0.01).

A second mathematical value, called the Center of Distribution, can also be computed from the Dosage Profile. To determine this value, the number of Brilliant points in the profile is doubled, and added to the number of Intermediate points; from this is then subtracted the number of Solid points and twice the number of Professional points. The result is then divided by the total number of points in the entire profile, including the Classic points. In Secretariat&#x27;s case, this would work out as 54 (40 + 14) minus 9 (9 + 0) divided by 50 (20 + 14 + 7 + 9 + 0), yielding a Center of Distribution of 0.90 (the figure nearly always being rounded to the nearest 100th of a point, as with the Dosage Index).

High Dosage Index (and Center of Distribution) figures are associated with a tendency to perform best over shorter distances, while low numbers signify an inherent preference for longer races. The median Dosage Index of contemporary North American thoroughbreds is estimated at 2.40 (the &quot;average&quot; figure being impossible to calculate because some horses have a Dosage Index of &quot;infinity,&quot; a scenario which arises when a horse has only Brilliant and/or Intermediate chef-de-race influences in its Dosage Profile). The average Center of Distribution for modern-day North American race horses is believed to be approximately 0.70 (both Dosage Index and Center of Distribution figures tend to be lower for European thoroughbreds because in Europe the races are longer on aggregate and European breeders thus place greater emphasis on breeding their horses for stamina rather than speed).

==Analysis==
Retroactive research conducted at the time the term &quot;Dosage Index&quot; first became common knowledge revealed that at that time no horse having a Dosage Index of higher than 4.00 had won the Kentucky Derby since at least 1929 (a year chosen because by then the number of available of chefs-de-race on which to base the figures was thought to have reached a critical mass), and that over the same period only one Belmont Stakes winner (Damascus in 1967) had such a Dosage figure. It was also determined at that time that few horses with no chef-de-race influences in the two most stamina-laden groups, Solid and Professional, had won major races at distances of miles or longer even if the horse had a sufficient Classic presence in its pedigree to keep the Dosage Index from being over 4.00 (when Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978, for instance, he became the first horse with no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile to win either the Kentucky Derby or the Belmont Stakes since the 1930s). In recent years, however, several horses with no Solid or Professional chefs-de-race in the first four generations of their pedigrees—and indeed, a few with Dosage Indexes of above 4.00—have managed to win the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, highlighting the issue of increasing speed and decreasing stamina in contemporary American thoroughbred pedigrees. For example, 1999 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet had a Dosage Index of 6.02, while 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo has a Dosage Index of 4.33 &quot;and&quot; no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile. Triple Crown winner American Pharoah has a Dosage Index of 4.33.

As a result of these anomalies, the theory&#x27;s usefulness has been questioned by some, at least with regard to the Kentucky Derby. The system&#x27;s defenders, however, point out that in recent times a large proportion of U.S.-bred horses with low Dosage figures have been sent to race in foreign countries where the distances of races are longer, resulting in most horses competing in the Kentucky Derby and similar American races having relatively high Dosage numbers and/or lacking Solid or Professional chef-de-race representation. Yet the statistical foundation of Dosage remains compelling and the theory accurately differentiates Thoroughbred pedigree type for large populations of horses competitively performing over a range of distances, track surfaces and ages. With regard to the Kentucky Derby, however, only results from 1981 onward reflect a method without retrofitting or using information unavailable at the time. Many of the chefs-de-race who &quot;predicted&quot; the 1929-1981 Derby winners were made that way because of the Derby winners themselves, making the logic circular.

<doc id="705556" wikidata="Q288128" url="?curid=705556" title="London Heliport">
<text>London Heliport , previously called Battersea Heliport and renamed on 1 August 2019 to the Edmiston London Heliport, is London&#x27;s only licensed heliport. The facility, which was built by W. &amp; C. French and opened on 23 April 1959, is located in Battersea on the south bank of the River Thames, southwest of Westminster Bridge and between Wandsworth Bridge and Battersea Railway Bridge. 

==Operations==
Prior to the official opening, the first aircraft to land at the heliport on 8 April 1959, was a Westland Widgeon Series 2, owned by Westland Aircraft.

The heliport, once owned by Westland and then Harrods, is a very small site, making use of a jetty to provide a helipad for take-off and landing, and onshore parking for three to four aircraft, depending upon their size. The heliport provides landing, parking and refuelling services between 08:00 and 21:00 (flights are permitted between 07:00 and 23:00), albeit parking is normally restricted to smaller helicopter categories.

Flight conditions and procedures at the heliport prescribe a circuit height above the Thames, in an extended figure-of-eight over the water, to seek to minimise noise pollution for residents in the area and to constrain flight operations to over the river, away from the built-up area. Ground running of rotors is restricted to a maximum of five minutes for the same reason.

In 2003 London Heliport was acquired by Weston Homes. In 2012 it was bought by the Reuben Brothers, who also own London Oxford Airport, for £35 million.

Edmiston announced in August 2019 that they would be taking over the title sponsorship of the heliport with a restyling of the interior &amp; exterior areas as well as repainting the helicopter landing apron.

The nearest main line railway station is and the nearest London Underground station is .

==Accidents and incidents==
On 16 January 2013 a Agusta A109 helicopter outbound from Redhill attempting to divert to London Heliport due to poor weather conditions at Elstree in adverse weather collided with a construction crane and then crashed into the street, killing the pilot and one person on the ground. This was the first fatal helicopter crash anywhere near the heliport since records began in 1976.

London Heliport has a fully licensed rescue and firefighting service who are on duty for all aircraft movements at the port as well as providing an emergency response to any helicopter incident within the London area. The Heliports Fire Service also conducts regular training alongside their colleagues in the London Fire Brigade and RNLI and offer training in helicopter emergencies to any emergency service.

<doc id="705558" wikidata="Q5345508" url="?curid=705558" title="Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley">
<text>Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley (circa 1515 – 12 July 1586). The oldest son and heir of John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley. He was an English nobleman and soldier. Contemporary sources also refer to him as &quot;Sir Edward Dudley&quot;.

==Early life==
Sir Edward was born around 1515 and was the eldest child and heir of John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley and Lady Cicely Grey, daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset; and the paternal grandson of Edmund Sutton, Knight of Dudley Castle and Baron Tibertot and Cherleton and maternal great-grandson of Elizabeth Woodville, former Queen consort of England.

==Career==

Sir Edward served in Ireland in 1536 under his uncle Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane. He was made a captain of a company of 100 archers, under Sir William Brereton and on recommendation from Thomas Cromwell. In 1538 his uncle wrote to Cromwell: &quot;I beseech your lordship to be good lord unto my poor nephew Dudley.&quot; The young Sir Edward was referred to as very poor by himself and his uncle, his father had lost his estate and Dudley Castle in 1537. He served in Ireland until 1538.

He joined an expedition to Scotland in 1547, where he became governor of Hume Castle after its capture by the English forces. He wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury from Hume on 11 September 1547 about the capture of the English Berwick Pursuivant, Henry Ray, and signed the letter &quot;E. Duddeley&quot;. Hume was retaken by the Scots in December 1548, and Sutton captured. He was held at Spynie Palace. At the end of the war, on 28 March 1550, the Earl of Shrewsbury was asked by the Privy Council to organise his release by the exchange of French hostages to the value of £200.

On the 17th of September 1553, Sutton succeeded his father (known as the &quot;Lord Quondam&quot; that is &#x27;Lord Formerly&#x27;) as Baron Dudley, and on the 2nd of October 1553, Sir Edward was knighted by Queen Mary I. He was called to Parliament in 1554 as Baron of Dudley and was restored to ownership of his ancestral Dudley Castle, which had been forfeited to the Crown by the attainder of his cousin the Duke of Northumberland.

He was lieutenant of Hampnes, in Picardy, from 1556 to 1558, though the appointment appears to have been made in 1554 and was for life. He abandoned Hampnes in 1558, fearing the French and fled to Flanders with his garrison. Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, wrote to Lord Robert Dudley and Sir William Cecil in 1562 about Sir Edward: &quot;Edward Dudley was the first that entered Tankerville and is there, as I understand, very well liked by the gentlemen of the country, and also those that serve with him.&quot; 

Upon the accession of Queen Elizabeth 1558, he sought to gain her favour, and entertained her at Dudley Castle, 1575.

==Personal life==

In 1553, the first year of the Catholic Queen Mary I of England, Sir Edward buried his father, Sir John &quot;Quondam&quot; Sutton, with Catholic rites. In 1554 Queen Mary granted him the manors of Horborne, the Priory of Dudley, and titles of Northfield and Sedgley, with lands and rights in Dudley, Tressel and Cradley.

After an early unsuccessful marriage proposal to a widow, a certain Anne, lady Berkeley, Sir Edward was married three times and had three children:

1. Catherine Brydges (m. 1556, d.1566), a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Queen Mary, and the daughter of John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos and Elizabeth (née Grey) of Wilton; they had one child:

* Anne (b. c. 1556, d. 1605), who married first Francis Throckmorton, conspirator against Queen Elizabeth I of England and had issue, and second Thomas Wylmer Esq., barrister at law and had issue.

Queen Mary settled upon Edward and Catherine and their heirs the &quot;... lordships of Sedgley, Himley and Swinford, the hays, forests and chases of Ashwood and Chaspell, and the lands called Willingsworth, in Sedgley, with divers lands and tenements in Himley, Wombourne and Swindon.&quot; With another grant in 1554, Queen Mary gave them and their male heirs Dudley Castle, Conigre Park and lands in Dudley, Fowley and Sedgley, which had been John Dudley&#x27;s, Duke of Northumberland, and confiscated by the crown on his death in 1553. The grant was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth in 1579.

2. Jane Stanley, a daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (m. 1567) with whom he had the following children:

*Edward Dudley, who became the 5th Baron Dudley (b. 17 September 1567, d. 23 June 1643).
*John Dudley (b. 30 November 1569, d. c. Feb 1644/45).

3. Mary Howard, the daughter of William, 1st Baron Howard on 16 December 1571 at Whitehall Palace in a triple wedding with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford and bride, Anne Cecil, and Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and bride Elizabeth Hastings. The year after Edward&#x27;s death, Mary remarried to Richard Mompesson (d. 1627), courtier and briefly Member of Parliament. She died in 1600 and is buried in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster.

In 1567, Sir Edward negotiated a prenuptial article of agreement for his daughter Anne, with Sir John Throckmorton for her to marry his eldest son and future conspirator, Francis Throckmorton. As part of this agreement, Anne was sent to be brought up by her future mother-in-law, Margery Throckmorton and the manors of Sedgley, Swinford and Himley and all other lands granted to Edward Sutton, Lord of Dudley by Philip and Mary were part of the dowry. Anne&#x27;s maternal aunt, Mary Brydges, was married to George Throckmorton, John&#x27;s brother and Francis&#x27; uncle. Anne and Francis had a son, John. After Francis was executed for treason in 1584, Anne married the Oxford educated barrister and member of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Thomas Wylmer Esq.

Sir Edward&#x27;s will was dated 8 July 1586 and mentions his ironworks and a large debt load, so large that he allowed his executors 21 years in which to discharge them using profits from his stock and iron manufacturers.

He was buried at St. Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster on 12 August 1586 and was succeeded by his son, Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley (1567–1643).

<doc id="705561" wikidata="Q1416204" url="?curid=705561" title="Wipeout (video game series)">
<text>Wipeout (stylised as wipE′out″ or WipEout) is a series of futuristic anti-gravity racing video games created by Psygnosis (later known as Studio Liverpool). Sony Interactive Entertainment owns the series and publishes most of the games.

The series is characterised by its fast-paced gameplay, cutting-edge 3D visuals that maximise the resolution capabilities of the game&#x27;s console, and its association with electronic dance music, particularly big beat-infused techno and trance. This includes collaborations with prominent electronic artists such as The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Leftfield, Orbital, Underworld, Fluke, and the in-house composer CoLD SToRAGE. Additionally, the series’ graphic design identity—crafted by The Designers Republic for the first three games—helped establish its signature futuristic rave aesthetic.

The concept of &quot;Wipeout&quot; was first discussed during a pub conversation, when a Psygnosis staff member, Jim Bowers, envisioned creating a futuristic racing game which featured anti-gravity ships. Some game design elements were influenced by &quot;Matrix Marauders&quot;, a 1990 Amiga game developed by the same Liverpool-based studio. A beta version of &quot;Wipeout&quot; appeared in the cult film &quot;Hackers&quot;, in which the protagonists are shown playing the game in a nightclub. This appearance is cited as a catalyst for Sony&#x27;s acquisition of Psygnosis in the months following the release of &quot;Hackers&quot;.

The &quot;Wipeout&quot; franchise has been well received by critics, with &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; in particular being listed among the PlayStation&#x27;s best games. &quot;Wipeout 2048&quot; was the last game to be developed by Studio Liverpool prior to their closure in August 2012. The series was later given a remaster called &quot;Wipeout Omega Collection,&quot; which released in 2017.

==Gameplay==

The &quot;Wipeout&quot; games are a series of futuristic racers that involve players piloting anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty.

Power-ups come in the form of offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, mines and rockets to energy shields, autopilots, and turbo boosts. These power-ups are usually collected by flying over coloured X-shaped pads on race tracks. Chevron-shaped speed pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player&#x27;s ship receives a momentary boost.

Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing team, although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Each ship has different characteristics; for example, ships will vary in handling, thrust, top speed, shield strength, and occasionally firepower. Every ship is equipped with a compulsory shield that absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player&#x27;s ship collides or is hit by weapon fire. If damage is sustained after the shield&#x27;s depletion, the ship in question will explode and the pilot is consequently eliminated from the race.

The games&#x27; campaign modes usually consist of single races, time trials, and tournaments.

* Standard single races involve the player competing against opponents to finish first and win a gold medal. As scoring is podium-based, silver and bronze medals are awarded for second and third place, respectively.
* Tournaments typically contain four or eight single races each; points are scored based on position for each race, and the pilot who accumulates the most points wins.
* Time trials and speed laps have the player obtaining the fastest time on a track in either a predetermined number of laps or an individual lap, respectively.
* &quot;Zone&quot; mode has been featured in every game since &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; and revolves around survival as the player automatically accelerates to extreme speeds. The mode will only end upon the destruction of the player&#x27;s ship.
* &quot;Eliminator&quot; mode was introduced in &quot;Wipeout 3&quot; and centres around pilots gaining points for damaging competitors and finishing laps.
* &quot;Combat&quot; mode is a slight variation of Eliminator and appears only in &quot;Wipeout 2048&quot;. The difference between the two is that in Combat, energy is restored through item absorption as opposed to completing a lap.

==Games==
===&quot;Wipeout&quot;===
&quot;Wipeout&quot; (stylised as &quot;wipE″out&quot;&quot;) is a futuristic racing video game developed and published by Psygnosis. It is the first game in the series and was originally released for the PlayStation and PCs running MS-DOS in 1995, and for the Sega Saturn the following year. It was also a launch title for the PlayStation in Europe and North America. Set in the year 2052, players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league, piloting one of a selection of craft in races on several different tracks around the world.

&quot;Wipeout&quot; featured music from well-known electronic artists such as Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, and Orbital. A prototype version of the game appeared in the teen cult film &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995), in which both protagonists were playing the game in a nightclub. A marketing campaign created and launched by Keith Hopwood and graphic design studio The Designers Republic included an infamous promotional poster featuring a bloodstained Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox, which was speculated by some of representing a drug overdose.

===&quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; (stylised as &quot;wipE&#x27;out&quot;&quot;2097; released as &quot;Wipeout XL&quot; in North America) is the second game of the franchise and is a direct sequel to the original game. It was first released worldwide in 1996 for the PlayStation, and for the Sega Saturn in the following year. Set in the year 2097, the game revolves around players racing in the F5000 anti-gravity racing league. The game was first unveiled to the public in the form of a pre-alpha demo at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 1996. The soundtrack featured a wider array of high-profile electronic music artists. Tracks by The Prodigy, Fluke, Underworld, and Photek were included, alongside returning contributors Leftfield and The Chemical Brothers.

===&quot;Wipeout 64&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout 64&quot; is the third installment of the series. It was released exclusively for the Nintendo 64 in November 1998 for North America, and later in 1999 for Europe. The game is set one year after the events of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; and shares the same anti-gravity racing league.

&quot;Wipeout 64&quot; reuses most of the race tracks featured in the previous games, albeit with mirrored layouts and different locations.

===&quot;Wipeout 3&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout 3&quot; (stylised as &quot;wip3out&quot; in Europe and Japan) is the fourth title in the franchise and was first released in September 1999 for the PlayStation, where players race in the F7200 league. An enhanced edition entitled &quot;Wipeout 3 Special Edition&quot; was released exclusively in Europe on 14 July 2000; featuring minor changes to gameplay, such as different craft physics, auto-loading of saves and artificial intelligence bug fixes. As with the first two games, Psygnosis once again hired The Designers Republic to assist in development. The Sheffield-based company, known for its underground techno album covers, provided &quot;visual candy&quot; to &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;″s graphics, designing the game&#x27;s icons, billboards, and colour schemes.

The game also featured music from Propellerheads, and with The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, returning from the first &quot;Wipeout&quot;. Psygnosis selected DJ Sasha to serve as the game&#x27;s music director.

===&quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; (stylised as &quot;wipEout fusion&quot;) is the fifth instalment of the series and was first released on the PlayStation 2 in 2002. The game was the first to be developed by the newly renamed Studio Liverpool. It is set in the year 2160 and revolves around players competing in the corrupt F9000 anti-gravity racing league. After the success of the previous games, the development team wanted to target &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; at an &quot;older, savvier crowd&quot; by making it stand out from the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series, which some critics had often compared it to.

===&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; (stylised as &quot;wipE&#x27;out pṳre&quot;) is the sixth game in the series and was released simultaneously with the launch of the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game takes place in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, and centres around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league.

Development of the game started in August 2003 and lasted until early 2005. Throughout production, the Liverpudlian studio created new user interfaces and other algorithms that helped speed up the development process in time for the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s launch. The game was notable for showcasing the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s graphical capabilities, and marked the first time a &quot;Wipeout&quot; game featured downloadable content—an aspect which had the potential to draw in more revenue for Studio Liverpool.

===&quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot; (stylised as &quot;wipEout pulse&quot;) is the seventh instalment and was first released for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. A port for the PlayStation 2 was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009, featuring enhanced graphics and all of the game&#x27;s downloadable content. The game takes place one year after the events of &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; and has players compete in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league. Development of the game was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans on the previous game, with many fans complaining of &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot;″s difficulty, thus prompting Studio Liverpool to improve on aspects where they had thought they failed. The game features sixteen licensed music tracks from techno artists, including Kraftwerk, DJ Fresh, and Skream.

===&quot;Wipeout HD&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout HD&quot; (stylised as &quot;WipEout HD&quot;) is the eighth title in the franchise and is the first to be released on the PS3 via PlayStation Network worldwide in 2008, although a retail version was later released exclusively in Europe the next year. A major expansion pack titled &quot;Wipeout HD Fury&quot; was released worldwide via the PlayStation Network in July 2009. This time, players compete in the FX350 anti-gravity racing league, set a year prior to the FX400 league, featuring a handful of race tracks from &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; and &quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot; (although all content has been upgraded to render 1080p visuals in 60 frames per second).

According to the game&#x27;s director, the team made the decision to release the game as a PlayStation Store exclusive title before development in order to stress that downloadable content did not have to be focused on &quot;small games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tech Interview: WipEout HD/Fury&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Wipeout HD&quot;″s expansion pack, &quot;Fury&quot;, received controversy over its in-game advertising, with many players complaining of extended loading times, as well as consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game that had already been paid for. The advertisements were removed soon after several complaints were made by players. The game was also chosen as a free PlayStation Store offering as part of Sony&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Back&quot; program due to the 2011 PlayStation Network outage.

===&quot;Wipeout 2048&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout 2048&quot; is the ninth and final game in the series to be developed by Studio Liverpool prior to their closure in August 2012. The game was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in early 2012 and centres around players competing in the first Anti-Gravity Racing Championships. It is set in the year 2048 and acts as a prequel to the first &quot;Wipeout&quot; game. &quot;Wipeout 2048&quot; was developed alongside the PlayStation Vita console itself, and acted as a &quot;testbed&quot; for the device. When the staff of the Liverpudlian studio were given development kits for what was then dubbed a &quot;Next Generation Portable&quot;, a group was set up within the team to brainstorm ideas. Among these included the proposal of a touchscreen device, which was not yet conceived by Sony at the time, and two analogue sticks—both features eventually made it onto the console.

===&quot;Wipeout 2D&quot;===
&quot;Wipeout 2D&quot; was released in 2013 on PlayStation Vita as part of the &quot;PlayStation Home Arcade&quot;.

===&quot;Wipeout Omega Collection&quot;===

&quot;Wipeout Omega Collection (stylised as WipE&#x27;out&quot; OMEGA COLLECTION)&quot; is a remaster of the previous two titles in the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series: &quot;Wipeout HD&quot; (with its &quot;Wipeout HD Fury&quot; expansion) and &quot;Wipeout 2048&quot;. &quot;Wipeout HD&quot; itself contained content from &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; and &quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot;. The game was developed by Clever Beans, EPOS Game Studios, and XDev. &quot;Wipeout Omega Collection&quot; was released in June 2017. It was designed to be run at 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, both at 60 frames per second.

===&quot;Wipeout Merge&quot;===
&quot;Wipeout Merge&quot; (previously known as &quot;Wipeout Rush&quot;) was announced by publisher Rogue Games on September 16, 2021 for iOS and Android devices. The game initially soft-launched in several regions throughout late 2021, and launched in the United States in early 2022. The game features over 60 ships from the series as well as a full single-player campaign. Unlike previous entries in the series, the gameplay consists of being a racing &quot;manager,&quot; and timing the deployment of weapons during races.

==Development==
All games in the &quot;Wipeout&quot; franchise, except for &quot;Wipeout Merge&quot;, were developed by Studio Liverpool. The conceptualisation of &quot;Wipeout&quot; revolved around Psygnosis designer Nick Burcombe&#x27;s idea of creating a racing game using the same types of anti-gravity vehicles featured in &quot;Powerdrome&quot;, a title first released on the Atari ST in 1988. The game&#x27;s futuristic vehicle designs were influenced by &quot;Matrix Marauders&quot;, a 1994 Amiga 3D racing game conceptualised by fellow Psygnosis employee Jim Bowers. The name &quot;Wipeout&quot; was decided upon during a pub conversation and was inspired by the instrumental song &quot;Wipe Out&quot; by The Surfaris.

After the beta version of &quot;Wipeout&quot; appeared in the cult film &quot;Hackers&quot;, Sony expressed interest in Psygnosis due to the &quot;impressive work&quot; the studio had produced with 3D graphics. In September 1995, Sony acquired the Liverpool-based company outright. The inclusion of a licensed soundtrack featuring big beat-infused electronic music, including artists like Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, and Orbital, became a defining feature of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series. This musical approach was inspired by designer Nick Burcombe&#x27;s experience of playing &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; while listening to tracks by The Prodigy, which led him to envision a racing game that captured the energy and attitude of 1990s electronic music culture.

Subsequent development of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; spanned seven months, and a nightclub tour in conjunction with Red Bull was set up to advertise the game. The game&#x27;s art, in-game branding, and packaging were made by Sheffield-based The Designers Republic, contributing to its distinctive style.

For the development of &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;, Psygnosis once again hired The Designers Republic to assist in development. Lead artist Nicky Westcott wanted to make the game look like a &quot;believable future&quot; to retain a realistic sensibility. &quot;Wipeout 3&quot; also featured a curated electronic soundtrack to complement its style, further cementing the franchise&#x27;s reputation for integrating music and gameplay. It was also the first game to benefit from the PlayStation&#x27;s analogue sticks, which were used to offer smoother control of the player&#x27;s craft.

Pre-production of &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; began in August 2003 and full production commenced in October of that year. The team received development kits of the then-upcoming PlayStation Portable the following year, and was made aware that &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; was going to be a launch title for that console. During development, Studio Liverpool created user interfaces and custom plugins for 3D computer graphics software entirely from scratch in order to help speed up the process.

&quot;Wipeout HD&quot; was first announced during E3 2007, and was revealed to be a downloadable-only title. The game&#x27;s director, Tony Buckley, said in a retrospective interview that the studio made the decision to release the game as a PlayStation Store exclusive title before development. There was a significant delay when reports emerged that the game&#x27;s Zone Mode had failed epilepsy testing, and that it would have to be redesigned before it could be released.

&quot;Wipeout 2048&quot; was developed in parallel with the PlayStation Vita itself, and had acted as a &quot;testbed&quot; for the console. The development of the game influenced the design of the console itself; staff from the Liverpudlian studio were sent to brainstorm ideas to senior management at Sony. Among these ideas included the proposal of a touchscreen device—which was not yet conceived at the time—as well as the inclusion of two sticks.

On 8 August 2012, Sony officially shut down Studio Liverpool as part of an effort to focus on alternative investment plans. At the time of their closure, the studio was working on a future &quot;Wipeout&quot; title for the PlayStation 4, which was reported to have been in development for 12 to 18 months.

==Reception==
The &quot;Wipeout&quot; series has been well received by critics. Its fast-paced gameplay, high-quality visuals, and prominent techno soundtracks have been cited as hallmarks of the series. Upon release, the first &quot;Wipeout&quot; game was widely praised for its electronica soundtrack, originality, and outstanding visuals; however, a critic at the time questioned its longevity and potential to hold a long lifespan in comparison to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;. In retrospect, &quot;Wipeout&quot; was described as being synonymous with Sony&#x27;s debut gaming hardware and as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. The game also increased awareness of the underground techno community in England, as it was one of the first games to include licensed music.

The second instalment of the series, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, was released to critical acclaim. Reviewers unanimously commended its innovation, graphics, and unique blend of techno music. IGN ranked it as the 13th best PlayStation game of all time in 2002, and &quot;&quot; named it as the fifth best in 1997. In addition, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; also ranks as the fourth best PlayStation game of all time at GameRankings. &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; received generally positive reviews, with some critics asserting that it was a superior game to &quot;F-Zero X&quot; in regards to graphics, atmosphere, and track design, though others noted that it did not reach the standards of its predecessor, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;.

The fourth instalment of the series, &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;, was positively received upon release; critics lauded the graphics, fast-paced gameplay, and music, although many reviews felt that the game&#x27;s steep learning curve was a major fault. &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; was more negatively received by critics; the graphics received mixed responses, with one reviewer saying that it looked like an &quot;early first generation PS2 game&quot;, despite another opining that the visuals had improved over all of its predecessors. At the time of &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;″s release in 2001, critics recognised the fact that techno music was an integral part of the series.

&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; and &quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot; both received very positive reviews upon release, with critics praising their visual effects, attention to detail, and track design. &quot;Wipeout HD&quot;, along with its &quot;Fury&quot; expansion pack, also received very positive reviews, with many critics agreeing that it offered the best visual representation of any &quot;Wipeout&quot; game due to it being upscaled in full 1080p and rendered in 60 frames per second. It was nominated for the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design&quot; category in the 12th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards and was also nominated under the racing category for the 28th Golden Joystick Awards. The final instalment in the franchise to be developed by Studio Liverpool, &quot;Wipeout 2048&quot;, received generally positive reviews despite it being the lowest ranked game overall. Critics cohesively commended the graphics and visuals, and also regarded it as a showcase for the PlayStation Vita&#x27;s power.

<doc id="705569" wikidata="Q1204169" url="?curid=705569" title="MOS Burger">
<text>, doing business as (which stands for &quot;Mountain Ocean Sun&quot;), is a multinational fast-food restaurant chain (fast-casual) from Japan. Its headquarters are in the ThinkPark Tower in Ōsaki, Shinagawa, Tokyo. At one time its headquarters were located in Shinjuku, Tokyo.
Being Japan&#x27;s answer to McDonald&#x27;s, it is the second-largest fast-food franchise in Japan after McDonald&#x27;s, and owns numerous overseas outlets over East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania, including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. &quot;MOS Burger&quot; is also the name of the standard hamburger offered by the restaurant, having been its first product when it opened in 1972.

MOS Burger&#x27;s outlets are located in suburban areas to avoid the rising land costs in central areas where the outlets of its competitor McDonald&#x27;s are located.
According to its then-president Kazuo Watanabe, MOS Burger is successful in its home country because it only cooks food when ordered, compared to its competitors which mass produce food items. It also avoids heavy advertising in the mass media; in 1992, its advertising expenses for its home market were US$10 million, compared to McDonald&#x27;s&#x27; US$100 million.

Its working culture emphasises on the company&#x27;s three attitudes of mind: self-resiliant, progressive and sympathetic towards others. Its managerial staff are trained for three months after being hired and are regularly sent for more training in Japan.

As of February 2014 the publicly traded company runs 1,730 MOS Burger and several AEN, Chef&#x27;s V and Green Grill stores. One slogan used within its stores is &quot;Japanese Fine Burger and Coffee&quot;.

== Name ==

The company name, styled in all caps: MOS Burger, is a backronym for &quot;Mountain, Ocean, Sun&quot;. Despite the backronym being coined by its founder Satoshi Sakurada, no one was able to explain whether mountains, oceans or suns have to do with burgers. The company was originally was a spinoff of Atsushi Sakurada&#x27;s previous company, Merchandising Organizing System. Later, the company began to use playful English phrases in point-of-purchase marketing materials to explain the name, including &quot;MOSt delicious burger&quot;, before it finally settled on the current backronym.

MOS Burger&#x27;s logo as of 1992 was a yellow M with signage in red, similar to McDonald&#x27;s.

== History ==
Sakurada, then attached with Nikko Securities&#x27; Los Angeles branch in the early 1960s, frequented the Los Angeles chili burger chain Original Tommy&#x27;s. Wanting to strike out on his own after returning to Japan he decided to adapt the cook-to-order hamburger concept used by Original Tommy&#x27;s. He also developed the MOS rice burger as an alternative to the hamburger.

As of 1992, MOS Burger had 1,100 outlets in Japan (1,021 in 1991 and 1,200 in 1993), being the country&#x27;s largest chain. It expects to open 100 more outlets in that year.

Its most popular items were teriyaki burger and rice burger with grilled rice cakes as its patty.

===International operations===
MOS Burger began its international expansion in 1989 with Taiwan, where its sukiyaki rice burger was popular with its customers. In 1991, its outlets reach a monthly sales target of between ¥ 5 million and ¥ 10 million.

As of 1992 it had five outlets in Hawaii, four in Taiwan and three noodle houses in the Los Angeles area. Sales of its international outlets reach an estimate of US$3 million. MOS Burger planned to open 500 more outlets in Asia, with 30 in Hong Kong, 250 in South Korea and the rest in Singapore and Taiwan.

In 1992, MOS Burger expanded to Singapore through joint venture Moriyoshi Foods, with its franchisee Palate (S) Pte Ltd. Palate owned 70% of the joint venture while MOS takes the rest of the stake. It plans to open five outlets in 1993 with the first one in Orchard Road open in April. The first outlet opened on 28 May 1993 at Isetan Scotts, with sales for its first year of operation expected to reach S$1.7 million. Palate later planned to open 7 more outlets in two to three years, totalling 30 in ten years. Its second outlet at Junction 8 opened in 1994.

In 1993, MOS Burger planned to expand to China. A joint venture with Yaohan International and a Chinese firm, it planned to open 3,000 outlets by the end of the year.

As of 1996, MOS Burger had five outlets in Singapore, with plans to expand to Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia.

In April 2011, MOS Burger opened its first store at Sunnybank Plaza, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. As at September 2021, the company had five stores in Australia, all of which were in Queensland. MOS Burger announced the closure of all its Australian stores in August 2024.

MOS Burger opened in the Philippines in February 2020.

== Products ==
=== MOS Rice Burger ===
The MOS Rice Burger uses a bun made of rice mixed with barley and millet. Rice was first used as a bun in 1987, when the restaurant served the Tsukune Rice Burger, filled with ground chicken and daikon, and seasoned with soy sauce.

The MOS Rice Burger has been imitated by the Taiwanese division of McDonald&#x27;s, where the rice bun was pan-seared, but it remains a MOS-exclusive item in Japan and other markets.

<doc id="705596" wikidata="Q4932014" url="?curid=705596" title="Bob Carolgees">
<text>Bob Carolgees (born Robert Frederick Johnson; 12 May 1948) is a British comedy entertainer who appeared on the Saturday morning TV series &quot;Tiswas&quot; and then later in its adult versions &quot;O.T.T.&quot; and &quot;Saturday Stayback&quot;. He is best known for appearing with a canine puppet named Spit the Dog. Carolgees also worked for eight years on the TV show &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; and on children&#x27;s game show &quot;Concentrate&quot;. In popular culture he has cameo roles with Spit the Dog.

==Career==

In the early 1970s Carolgees ran a DJ and modelling school in Liverpool. After a five-week course, DJs and models were tested in front of an audience at the Sportsmans Club in central Liverpool. He first appeared in a guest spot on &quot;Tiswas&quot; on 31 March 1979.

Clowning around with a monkey puppet named Charlie, Carolgees went down well with the viewing audience and after being invited back for several guest spots he soon became a team presenter. Carolgees, in pyjamas and headband, was also the &quot;Tiswas&quot; character &quot;Houdi Elbow&quot;, a comedy psychic and small-time magician.

As well as gaining national fame with these and Spit the Dog (plus Cough the Cat), he was also part of The Four Bucketeers who made the UK Top 30 in 1980, even making a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance.

Carolgees went on to work for eight years alongside Cilla Black in &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; and for nearly two decades he entertained British armed forces around the world. He also fronted pop/game show &quot;Hold Tight!&quot;, produced by Granada Television for Children&#x27;s ITV and game show Concentration.

Throughout the 1980s, Carolgees appeared in a series of TV adverts for Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise.

Carolgees was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1994 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Lyceum Theatre in Crewe.

Carolgees used to own a candle shop, Carolgees Candles, in Frodsham, Cheshire. He temporarily came out of show business retirement to appear with all his old colleagues in &quot;Tiswas Reunited&quot; on ITV on 16 June 2007.

Carolgees appeared in pantomime at Hull New Theatre for the 2013 run of Jack and the Beanstalk, replacing an unwell Keith Harris. Carolgees was quoted as saying &quot;What I had missed most was panto&quot;. In 2017 Carolgees again came out of retirement for pantomime.

==Spit the Dog==
Spit the Dog is a puppet best known for his spitting. An early Spit the Dog puppet raised over £5,000 at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 2004.

==Stage name==
The name Carolgees comes from friends Carole and George Dunmore who owned a record shop called Carolgees Records &amp; Cassettes. Carole Gee was his assistant in an earlier stint as a youth leader in what is now the MAC Midlands Arts Centre mac (Birmingham) in the late 1960s. Carole and George also operated a mobile disco called Carolgees Cabaret Disco around Merseyside and was where Carolgees developed his act.

==In popular culture==
Carolgees received a mention in every episode of &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;, and appeared in the episode &#x27;Leonard&#x27;. He and &quot;Spit the Dog&quot; can briefly be seen hosting a &quot;Trisha&quot; style early morning discussion show in Peter Kay&#x27;s follow up comedy &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;. He can also be seen on the back of a leaflet in the toilets in the first episode. Carolgees and puppet Spit the Dog appeared in a 2015 episode of ITV series &quot;Who&#x27;s Doing the Dishes?&quot;

<text>Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley, (29 November 1828 – 9 December 1921) was an English judge.

==Early life==
He was the second son of the botanist Dr. John Lindley, born at Acton Green, London. From his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from Sir Edward Coke. He was educated at University College School, and studied for a time at University College London, and the University of Edinburgh and University of Cambridge in 1898 and achieved Doctor of Civil Law in University of Oxford in 1903.

==Legal career==
He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1850, and began practice in the Court of Chancery. In 1855 he published &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Jurisprudence&quot;, consisting of a translation of the general part of Thibaut&#x27;s &quot;System des Pandekten Rechts&quot;, with copious notes. In 1860 he published in two volumes his &quot;Treatise on the Law of Partnership, including its Application to Joint Stock and other Companies&quot;, and in 1862 a supplement including the Companies Act 1862. This work has since been developed into two textbooks well known to lawyers as &quot;Lindley on Companies&quot; and &quot;Lindley on Partnership&quot;. Among his pupils were Francis William Maclean, later Chief Justice of Bengal, and Frederick Pollock.

He took silk in February 1872. In 1874 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple, of which he was treasurer in 1894

===Judicial career===
In 1875, he was appointed to be a Serjeant-at-law and a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, the appointment of a chancery barrister to a common-law court being justified by the fusion of common law and equity then shortly to be brought about, in theory at all events, by the Judicature Acts.

In 1875, he was knighted. In 1880 he became a justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench and in 1881 he was raised to be a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal and was sworn of the Privy Council.

In 1897, Lord Justice Lindley succeeded Lord Esher as Master of the Rolls, and in 1900 he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary with a life peerage and the title of Baron Lindley, of East Carleton in the County of Norfolk. He resigned the judicial post in 1905.

Prior to the 1875 reforms, the appointment of serjeants-at-law had already declined, but common law judges could only be appointed from amongst the serjeants-at-law, so it was customary for any appointee who was not yet a serjeant to be appointed a serjeant immediately prior to being appointed a judge. As the requirement for common law judges to be serjeants was abolished shortly after, Lord Lindley became the last serjeant-at-law appointed, and the last judge to wear the serjeant&#x27;s coif, or rather the black patch representing it, on the judicial wig.

Mount Lindley in Antarctica is named after him.

==Family==
He married Sarah Katharine, daughter of Edward John Teale of Leeds, on 5 Aug 1858. He died at home in East Carleton, near Norwich, in 1921. They had nine children, including diplomat Sir Francis Oswald Lindley and the army officer Major-General John Lindley.

==Coat of arms==
==Writing==
Lord Lindley published two notable works, &quot;Lindley on Companies&quot; and &quot;Lindley on Partnership&quot;. The latter is still published today, as &quot;Lindley and Banks on Partnership&quot;, now in its 21st edition (2022).

<doc id="705600" wikidata="Q2082317" url="?curid=705600" title="Cesàro summation">
<text>In mathematical analysis, Cesàro summation (also known as the Cesàro mean or Cesàro limit) assigns values to some infinite sums that are not necessarily convergent in the usual sense. The Cesàro sum is defined as the limit, as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity, of the sequence of arithmetic means of the first &quot;n&quot; partial sums of the series.

This special case of a matrix summability method is named for the Italian analyst Ernesto Cesàro (1859–1906).

The term &quot;summation&quot; can be misleading, as some statements and proofs regarding Cesàro summation can be said to implicate the Eilenberg–Mazur swindle. For example, it is commonly applied to Grandi&#x27;s series with the conclusion that the &quot;sum&quot; of that series is 1/2.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a sequence, and let

:formula_2

be its th partial sum.

The sequence is called Cesàro summable, with Cesàro sum , if, as tends to infinity, the arithmetic mean of its first &quot;n&quot; partial sums tends to :

:formula_3

The value of the resulting limit is called the Cesàro sum of the series formula_4 If this series is convergent, then it is Cesàro summable and its Cesàro sum is the usual sum.

==Examples==

===First example===
Let for . That is, formula_5 is the sequence
:formula_6
Let denote the series
:formula_7
The series is known as Grandi&#x27;s series.

Let formula_8 denote the sequence of partial sums of :
:formula_9

This sequence of partial sums does not converge, so the series is divergent. However, Cesàro summable. Let formula_10 be the sequence of arithmetic means of the first partial sums:
:formula_11
Then
:formula_12
and therefore, the Cesàro sum of the series is .

===Second example===
As another example, let for . That is, formula_1 is the sequence

:formula_14

Let now denote the series

:formula_15

Then the sequence of partial sums formula_16 is

:formula_17

Since the sequence of partial sums grows without bound, the series diverges to infinity. The sequence of means of partial sums of G is

:formula_18

This sequence diverges to infinity as well, so is Cesàro summable. In fact, for the series of any sequence which diverges to (positive or negative) infinity, the Cesàro method also leads to the series of a sequence that diverges likewise, and hence such a series is not Cesàro summable.

== summation==

In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro stated a broader family of summation methods which have since been called for non-negative integers . The method is just ordinary summation, and is Cesàro summation as described above.

The higher-order methods can be described as follows: given a series , define the quantities

:formula_19

(where the upper indices do not denote exponents) and define to be for the series . Then the sum of is denoted by and has the value
:formula_20

if it exists . This description represents an -times iterated application of the initial summation method and can be restated as

:formula_21

Even more generally, for , let be implicitly given by the coefficients of the series

:formula_22

and as above. In particular, are the binomial coefficients of power . Then the sum of is defined as above.

If has a sum, then it also has a sum for every , and the sums agree; furthermore we have if (see little- notation).

== Cesàro summability of an integral ==
Let . The integral formula_23 is summable if

:formula_24

exists and is finite . The value of this limit, should it exist, is the sum of the integral. Analogously to the case of the sum of a series, if , the result is convergence of the improper integral. In the case , convergence is equivalent to the existence of the limit

:formula_25

which is the limit of means of the partial integrals.

As is the case with series, if an integral is summable for some value of , then it is also summable for all , and the value of the resulting limit is the same.

<doc id="705604" wikidata="Q381936" url="?curid=705604" title="Star (keelboat)">
<text>The Star is a one-design racing keelboat for two people designed by Francis Sweisguth in 1910. The Star was an Olympic keelboat class from 1932 through to 2012, the last year keelboats appeared at the Summer Olympics.

It is sloop-rigged, with a mainsail larger in proportional size than any other boat of its length. Unlike most modern racing boats, it does not use a spinnaker when sailing downwind. Instead, when running downwind a whisker pole is used to hold the jib out to windward for correct wind flow. Early Stars were built from wood, but modern boats are generally made of fiberglass. The boat must weigh at least with a maximum total sail area of .
The Star class pioneered an unusual circular boom vang track, which allows the vang to effectively hold the boom down even when the boom is turned far outboard on a downwind run. Another notable aspect of Star sailing is the extreme hiking position adopted by the crew and at times the helmsman, who normally use a harness to help hang low off the windward side of the boat with only their lower legs inside.

==History==

The Star was designed in 1910 by Francis Sweisguth, a draftsman at the William Gardner Marine Architect office. Over the course of his career Sweisguth designed a variety of yachts. A more traditional example of his work is Silent Maid, a Barnegat Bay B-class catboat designed shortly after the Star. The first 22 stars were built in Port Washington, New York by Ike Smith during the winter of 1910–11. Since that time, over 8,400 boats have been built, with more than 2,000 actively racing in 170 fleets.

The hull is a hard chine design with a slight curve to the bottom section, and a bulb keel. The Star was originally rigged with a large, low-aspect-ratio gunter mainsail and jib, which was replaced by a short bermuda rig gradually during the early 1920s, before the current tall bermuda sail plan was adopted in 1930. In 1965, fiberglass replaced wood as the primary hull material. Other changes to the strict design rules for the Star class, include adding flexible spars, an innovative circular-track boom vang, and self-bailers.

== Events ==

=== Olympics ===
The Star was added to the Olympic roster for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Due to World War II, there were no Olympic games held in 1940 or 1944, and for 1976, the Star was replaced by the Tempest for keelboat competition. In 2011 keelboats were removed from sailing at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The last keelboat Olympics competition was at the 2012 London Summer Olympics.

=== World Championships ===
The Star World Championships has been held annually since 1923. Most titles has American sailor Lowell North won, with five titles between 1945 and 1973 and another seven podiums. The most crowned skipper-crew combination is Italian duo Agostino Straulino and Nicolò Rode and Brazilian duo Robert Scheidt and Bruno Prada with three titles each. Also, American Mark Reynolds has three titles, but with different crew.

=== Star Sailors League ===
The Star Sailors League was created in 2013 by athletes to establish a sustainable sailing circuit.

<doc id="705605" wikidata="Q1676827" url="?curid=705605" title="Jabberwacky">
<text>Jabberwacky is a chatbot created by British programmer Rollo Carpenter and launched in 1997. Its stated aim is to &quot;simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner&quot;. It is an early attempt at creating an artificially intelligent chatbot through human interaction.

== Purpose ==
The stated purpose of the project is to create an artificial intelligence that is capable of passing the Turing Test. It is designed to mimic human interaction and to carry out conversations with users. It is not designed to carry out any other functions.

Unlike more traditional AI programs, the learning technology is intended as a form of entertainment rather than being used for computer support systems or corporate representation. Recent developments do allow a more scripted, controlled approach to sit atop the general conversational AI, aiming to bring together the best of both approaches, and usage in the fields of sales and marketing is underway.

The ultimate intention is that the program move from a text based system to be wholly voice operated—learning directly from sound and other sensory inputs. Its creator believes that it can be incorporated into objects around the home such as robots or talking pets, intending both to be useful and entertaining, keeping people company.

== Cleverbot ==
Cleverbot is the evolved version of the older Jabberwacky chatterbot, or chatbot, originally launched in 1997 on the web. While Cleverbot.com continued to work in 2023, the Jabberwacky&#x27;s website, tagged as &quot;legacy only,&quot; stopped working temporarily from December 31, 2022 until approximately June 1, 2023, experienced a restoration for a little more than two weeks and then stopped working again.

== Timeline ==
* 1981 – The first incarnation of this project is created as a program hard-coded on a Sinclair ZX81.
* 1988 – Learning AI project founded as &#x27;Thoughts&#x27;
* 1997 – Launched on the Internet as &#x27;Jabberwacky&#x27;
* October 2003 – Jabberwacky is awarded third place in the Loebner Prize. It was beaten by Juergen Pirner&#x27;s Jabberwock (A German-based chat program)
* September 2004 – Jabberwacky is awarded second place in the Loebner Prize. It was beaten by computer chat program A.L.I.C.E.
* September 2005 – George, a character within Jabberwacky, wins the Loebner Prize
* September 2006 – Joan, another Jabberwacky character, wins the Loebner Prize
* October 2008 – A new variant of Jabberwacky is launched, more fuzzy and with deeper context, under the name Cleverbot
* January 2023 – The legacy website started displaying a 504 Gateway Time-out multiple times with a redirect at least once to boibot.com on February 28, 2023. According to the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine, the site was last active and working on December 31, 2022. No media outlet covered the change or noted any press release about it.
* June 2023 - the Jabberwacky site became accessible once more until it stopped working again the week of June 18, 2023. As with the outage, no media outlet covered the changes or noted any press release to explain the five-month down time, the restoration or the new outage.

<doc id="705606" wikidata="Q2631977" url="?curid=705606" title="Wales Millennium Centre">
<text>Wales Millennium Centre () is Wales&#x27; national arts centre located in the Cardiff Bay area of Cardiff, Wales. The site covers a total area of . Phase 1 of the building was opened during the weekend of 26–28 November 2004 and phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert.

The centre is Cardiff&#x27;s principal receiving venue for large-scale opera, ballet, contemporary dance and musicals. It comprises a large theatre and a smaller hall with a shop, bars and a café. It houses the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales and opera, dance, theatre and literature companies, with a total of eight arts organisations in residence.

In 2012 the Centre announced that it would also be a producing company. Its productions across the genres have been performed in London, Edinburgh and Australia. In 2021 and 2024 it was in co-production with the Royal National Theatre. 
The main theatre, the Donald Gordon Theatre, has 1,896 seats, and is the second largest stage in Europe. The BBC Hoddinott Hall seats 350 and the Weston Studio Theatre seats 250.

In 2001 Lord Rowe-Beddoe was appointed chair of Wales Millennium Centre, a company limited by guarantee. Peter Swinburn is the current chair of Wales Millennium Centre.

== Background ==

=== The failed Cardiff Bay Opera House project===


Wales Millennium Centre replaced an earlier project for the site, the Cardiff Bay Opera House, a plan supported by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation to construct a permanent home for the Welsh National Opera.

An international design competition attracted 268 international applicants, and was won by Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid. Her avant-garde design was so radical that she and a selection of other applicants were asked to submit revised designs for a second round of competition—which she again won with &quot;a sleek and dazzling complex of sharp lines and surfaces that she compared to an &#x27;inverted necklace&#x27;&quot;.

In December 1995 the Millennium Commission, the body which distributed funds from the UK National Lottery, decided against lottery funding for the project. It was suggested that the bid failed because of &quot;the unpopular Conservative government&#x27;s fear of controversy&quot;, favouring the funding of projects perceived as more populist, such as the Millennium Stadium.

=== Origins of Wales Millennium Centre ===
After the Cardiff Bay Opera House project was rejected, a new project was conceived that included more than opera and was felt to be a better reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (the property division of Associated British Ports) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The £20 million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This is believed to be the largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.

== Phase 1 Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre ==
In addition to the two main theatres, the Donald Gordon Theatre and the Weston Studio, the phase 1 of Wales Millennium Centre has several function rooms. Urdd Gobaith Cymru has a hostel with overnight accommodation for 153 people in en suite bedrooms, called the Urdd City Sleepover.
It also has a performance and teaching space in the Urdd Hall/Theatre, with 153 retractable seats.

The building also includes rehearsal rooms, orchestral facilities for the Welsh National Opera, dance studios and the Blue Room, with seating for up to 100, for National Dance Company Wales in the Dance House.

There are three bars; the Awen Bar on level 2, the Horizons Bar on level 4, and the Stones Bar on level 5. The café-bar Ffwrnais is situated in the foyer, along with the wine bar One. Free performances occasionally take place in the foyer on the Glanfa stage.

=== Design and construction ===
Wales Millennium Centre was designed by Jonathan Adams of local practice Percy Thomas Architects (taken over by Capita Group in 2004), with Arup Acoustics as the acoustic designer and building engineer. His first concept drawings were made in early 1998, and by 1999 his design had started to look more like the building it is today.

Construction began on 25 February 2002. The main contractor was Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd was the roofing contractor, and Carr and Angier were theatre consultants. Other contractors included Stent (foundations), Swansea Institute of Higher Education, now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (glass), GH James Cyf (stonemasonry), Rimex (stainless steel), Alfred McAlpine (slate), Coed Cymru (wood), Ann Catrin Evans (door furniture) and Amber Hiscott (etchings on glass walls).

The architect&#x27;s concept was a building that expressed &quot;Welshness&quot; and was instantly recognisable. The building was designed to reflect many different parts of Wales with local Welsh materials that dominate its history: slate, metal, wood and glass. Many of the materials used come from Wales, including 1,350 tonnes of Welsh slate. A million metres of electric cable and 300,000 concrete blocks were also used in construction.

Slate
The exterior of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to give the impression of rock strata in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.
I always loved going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there looked like a building anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered if it would be possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn&#x27;t good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... &quot;—architect Jonathan Adams&quot;
Metal

Wales Millennium Centre&#x27;s main feature, the bronze coloured dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that was treated with copper oxide. It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and to look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.
We all know that steel making has been important to south Wales, just as slate making has changed the landscape of the north. We have to use a special type of steel that won&#x27;t go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials should have a &quot;natural&quot; texture, and that they should be instantly recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the landscape of the industrial south. &quot;—Jonathan Adams&quot;

Wood

Both the inside and outside of the building – including the main Donald Gordon Theatre, the balconies and the rear of the building – are dominated by bands of hardwood lining the walls.

Like the exterior of the building, the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of the exterior, with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods. Oak, ash, beech, sycamore, alder, birch, chestnut and cherry woods from renewable sources in mid-Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest. The design of the concourse galleries is intended to evoke the image of the edge of the forest, partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because the edge of the forest in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the supporting columns. &quot;—Jonathan Adams&quot;

Glass

Glass was used to incorporate into the bands of slate. It is thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. Glass is not used in the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain.

Jonathan Adams said, &quot;The glass veins in the external walls of the Wales Millennium Centre make use of conventional glass in a unique way: the sheets of glass are stacked together and fused in a kiln to form solid blocks.&quot;

Calligraphy


Inscribed on the front of the dome, above the main entrance are two lines written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in Welsh and English. The lettering is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and is internally illuminated at night.

The idea of this monumental inscription comes from Roman classical architecture. The Romans brought Christianity to these islands, along with the custom of engraving stone. The form of the Celtic cross embodies the cross-fertilisation of indigenous and Roman cultures, from which the Welsh nation first emerged. The monumental inscription is a familiar feature of Roman architecture. The inscription over the entrance of the Wales Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition, and also a recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation. We&#x27;re lucky to have two languages; one that we share with half the world and one which belongs just to us. Words in songs, stories and poems have helped to make Wales the proud country that it is. &quot;—Jonathan Adams&quot;
Gwyneth Lewis said of the inscription:

I wanted the words to reflect the architecture of the building. Its copper dome reminded me of the furnaces from Wales&#x27;s industrial heritage and also Ceridwen&#x27;s cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration (&#x27;awen&#x27;). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. &quot;—Gwyneth Lewis&quot;

&quot;In These Stones Horizons Sing&quot; is also an orchestral work, composed by Karl Jenkins and commissioned by Wales Millennium Centre for the building&#x27;s opening.

=== Opening weekend ceremony ===
The building was officially opened on the weekend of 26–28 November 2004. Bryn Terfel organised the ceremony and was the creative director of the weekend.

Day 1 26 November 2004
The day started with a speech from Wales Millennium Centre chairman Lord Rowe-Beddoe, who declared that the proceedings were underway. This was followed by a speech from Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation, that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite.

The building was opened by Janet Thickpenny, a young mother from Barry, who was chosen because her 40th birthday coincided with the opening day. A human chain delivered the symbolic key, designed and cast by Ann Catrin Evans, to Janet. This was accompanied by a fanfare from the National Youth Brass Band of Wales to Karl Jenkins&#x27; specially commissioned work &quot;In These Stones Horizons Sing,&quot; and Wales Millennium Centre was open.

The evening celebrations began with &quot;Cymru for the World&quot;, which celebrated the achievements of five leading Welsh artists; Gwyneth Jones, Shirley Bassey, Siân Phillips, Alun Hoddinott and Richard Burton, represented by his daughter Kate Burton. This included tributes from Robert Hardy, Jonathan Pryce, Derek Jacobi, Nana Mouskouri, Catrin Finch, Ruth Madoc and Ian McKellen. The concert was directed by Ken Caswell and conducted by David Charles Abell.

Bryn Terfel started with a short speech and introduced the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers, who in hard hats and donkey jackets sang and danced the story of the building&#x27;s construction. They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus, including Gwyn Hughes Jones and Bryn Terfel. Dennis O&#x27;Neill sang a duet from &quot;Pearl Fishers&quot;. Diversions performed a new ballet based on one of Alun Hoddinott&#x27;s works. The Welsh National Opera performed the final scene of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; in their new home. The evening ranged included many types of music, from popular to classical.

Day 2 27 November 2004

On the second day, the doors opened for the public to explore the building. A continuous stream of people filled through the building during the day, which concluded with a fireworks display in the Roald Dahl Plass.

Day 3 28 November 2004

The final day of the opening weekend began with the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales, who met First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Lord Rowe-Beddoe, and marked the event by unveiling a plaque. A key was presented to the Queen by Richard Burton&#x27;s granddaughter, Charlotte Frances Ritchie. Philip Madoc, Siân Phillips, Gaby Roslin, Michael Ball, Charlotte Church, Catrin Finch and Only Men Aloud! were among the artists that entertained the audience during the first act. The second act was opened by Welsh National Opera and later the Kirov Ballet and Cirque Éloize entertained the audience. Bryn Terfel ended the celebrations.

===2022/23 Refurbishment of Phase 1 Cabaret and Bocs===

The 2022/23 refurbishment of Wales Millennium Centre started with the opening of an immersive theatre space called &quot;Bocs&quot; (Welsh for &quot;box&quot;) on 27 August 2022. It has a programme of 360° films and projections, as well as extended reality experiences, including augmented reality, mixed reality and virtual reality. It was announced in September 2022 that a £4 million refurbishment of Wales Millennium Centre would take place and would include an area for cabaret acts, a redesigned foyer and new ticketing office, a long bar, a members’ bar and lounge, and bespoke seating areas. The new 140-seat cabaret venue, which replaced &quot;Ffresh&quot; restaurant/bar, is simply called &quot;Cabaret.&quot; It presents drag, comedy, burlesque, and gig theatre performances and opened in February 2023. The refurbishment was carried out by interior designers Richard H Powell trading as Powell.

== Phase 2 BBC Hoddinott Hall and Grace Williams Studio==
Phase 2 of Wales Millennium Centre is home to the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW) and the BBC National Chorus of Wales. BBC NOW moved from Studio 1 at Broadcasting House in Llandaff, which the orchestra had outgrown since the late 1960s. Phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert performed by the BBC NOW and conducted by Thierry Fischer. Phase 2 includes the 350-seater BBC Hoddinott Hall (), also known simply as Hoddinott Hall, which is named after the late Welsh classical composer Alun Hoddinott (11 August 1929 – 12 March 2008), and the Grace Williams Studio, which is named after another Welsh composer, Grace Williams (19 February 1906 – 10 February 1977), and is used as a centre for education and outreach work. Phase 2 also has space for practice rooms, a music library and backstage facilities, and provides a four-storey office space.

===Design and construction===
The original plans for Wales Millennium Centre were that it would have a concert hall, but the final design of phase 1 did not include one. Instead, space was left for a concert hall to be built after phase 1 opened in 2004, and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005. However, phase 2 construction did not actually begin until April 2007. Phase 2 was designed to fit into Wales Millennium Centre&#x27;s curved slate frontage, with an upper part constructed from timber.

Phase 2 of Wales Millennium Centre was designed by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture, formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of Capita Symonds, with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design. The main contractor was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, with MJN Colston Ltd responsible for the design and installation of all the mechanical, electrical and public health services in the building. Other subcontractors on the project included URS Corporation, Davis Langdon and Hulley &amp; Kirkwood.

Tim Green said that the exterior of phase 2 was designed to be in keeping with phase 1, while the interior had its own theme, that of a traditional Welsh chapel. He said that &quot;The timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of Victorian chapels and the masonry above. The stonework you would normally get in a stone chapel has been replaced by concrete.&quot; 
During the design and construction period, the project name for phase 2 was C Bay. Construction began in April 2007. It ended when the keys to the building were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008, and BBC Wales began to fit out the interior of the Hoddinott Hall.

Phase 2 also includes the 60 seat Grace Williams Studio, which is used by BBC NOW and Chorus for workshops and rehearsals for its outreach work.

===Opening Festival===
To commemorate the opening of BBC Hoddinott Hall, an inaugural concert took place on 22 January 2009. It was part of an opening festival which took place between 22 January and 1 February 2009. The concert was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was conducted by Thierry Fischer. It included the world premiere of &quot;St Vitus in the Kettle&quot; by Simon Holt, the orchestra&#x27;s composer in association, who took over from Michael Berkeley. BBC Hoddinott Hall was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 31 January 2009, where he unveiled a plaque.

===Awards for Phase 2===
* Engineering Excellence Award from the Association for Consultancy and Engineering.
* 2009 Special Award: Best Use of Panel Products from the Wood Awards

==Phase 3 The planned &quot;digital and immersive arts&quot; theatre==
The third phase of the development of Wales Millennium Centre is a proposed new stand-alone 550-seater theatre and facilities for production, rehearsal and training, opposite the existing main building (phase 1 and 2). It will be an &quot;immersive&quot; arts theatre and will be located next to the proposed new 15,000-seater indoor arena for Cardiff. Cardiff Council has appointed Goldbeck Construction as the building contractor for the new development. The new theatre will be located in the car park of the Atlantic Wharf and part of the parking area of Cardiff Council’s County Hall. The building will incorporate the council&#x27;s new modern headquarters, which will replace the ageing County Hall.

== Resident organisations ==
Wales Millennium Centre is home to eight arts organisations:

* Literature Wales – Welsh national literature promotion agency and society for writers
* National Dance Company Wales – previously known as Diversions
* Hijinx Theatre – one of Europe’s leading inclusive theatre companies
* Two Rhythms – providing educational touch and movement therapies to people with profound disabilities and autism. Previously known as Touch Trust
* Tŷ Cerdd – music information centre for amateur and professional musicians, including the Welsh Music Information Centre, Welsh Amateur Music Federation, National Youth Arts Wales and Cyfansoddwyr Cymru (Composers of Wales)
* Urdd Gobaith Cymru – Wales&#x27; largest youth organisation
* Welsh National Opera – an international touring opera company
* BBC National Orchestra of Wales – the only professional national symphony orchestra for Wales

== Corporate financing and rebranding ==

The total cost of phase 1 of the project was £106.2 million. The National Lottery Millennium Fund provided £31.7 million, a further £37 million came from The National Assembly for Wales and £10.4 million was donated by the Arts Council of Wales. In addition, a private investor, South African businessman Donald Gordon, donated £20 million to be shared equally between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre. The Wales Millennium Centre also received a £13.5 million loan from HSBC. The remaining funds for the project came from a major sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society. The Weston Studio is named after the Garfield Weston Foundation, and is located on Level 1 of the building. Many other corporations and public bodies provide sponsorship to Wales Millennium Centre.

The National Assembly for Wales announced on 6 November 2007 that it was to pay off the outstanding loan of £13.5 million from HSBC and also increase its annual funding. From April 2008, the Assembly gave an annual grant of £3.5 million to Wales Millennium Centre for 3 years. This was intended only to repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the organisation remained profitable. The money came from unallocated funds from the Assembly&#x27;s previous budget and the then Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, said that it would not come at the expense of other art projects in Wales.

The cost of phase 2 of the project was approximately £18 million. The BBC does not own the building, but has leased it for 25 years from the Lime Property Fund, a subsidiary of Aviva Investors. Phase 2 was built by Concert Bay Ltd, a subsidiary of Sir Robert McAlpine Enterprises Ltd, which co-funded the scheme along with Lime Property Fund.

In November 2006, Wales Millennium Centre announced that it would begin a two-phase rebranding project. The project was won by a local Cardiff company, Sweet. The first phase of the project involved a new corporate logo; the second phase included the redesign of other marketing tools, such as brochures and advertisements.

== In popular culture ==
Doctor Who and Torchwood

Wales Millennium Centre has made numerous appearances in film and television, including in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, whose modern era is produced locally by BBC Wales. It has appeared seven times to date: as itself from outside in the episode &quot;Boom Town&quot;; its marquee momentarily at the end of the episode &quot;Bad Wolf&quot;; its lobby as a hospital lobby in the far future in the episode &quot;New Earth&quot;, and again in &quot;The Girl Who Waited&quot;; and briefly in the episodes &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot;.

The spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; has its headquarters, known as &quot;The Hub&quot;, set underneath the Water Tower in Roald Dahl Plass, with Wales Millennium Centre&#x27;s frontage featuring heavily through the show.

Jones Jones Jones

On 3 November 2006, a record-breaking attempt to gather the most people with the same surname, Jones, took place at Wales Millennium Centre under the show banner &quot;Jones Jones Jones&quot;, filmed for television by S4C. The record was broken with 1,224 Joneses filling the Donald Gordon Theatre. The previous record was set in Sweden in 2004 when 583 people gathered who had the same surname of Norberg.

Gavin &amp; Stacey

The airport scene from episode 1 of the second series of the BBC TV show &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; was filmed in Wales Millennium Centre.

<doc id="705609" wikidata="Q976580" url="?curid=705609" title="Melody A.M.">
<text>Melody A.M. is the debut studio album by Norwegian electronic music duo Röyksopp, released on 13 September 2001 by Wall of Sound. The album reached number one in the Norwegian Albums chart. In the UK, it reached number nine in the country&#x27;s Album chart, and topped both the Dance Albums and the Independent Albums charts. As of 2005, the album had sold 750,000 copies worldwide, with 454,271 sold in the United Kingdom alone.

==Composition==
Jon Setzen of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; describes the album as &quot;an across-the-board mix of bleepy synths, crunch beats and ambient, dreamy vocals, with even a bit disco mixed in at times&quot;. With the album, &quot;Röyksopp balances the haunted atmospheres of Boards of Canada with the more traditional &quot;songwriting&quot; sensibility of downbeat specialists like Groove Armada or Koop&quot;, according to John Bush of AllMusic. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; exemplifies the band&#x27;s intention to combine &quot;Satie-esque harmonies and melodies like those of Francis Lai with the best aspects of three decades of electronic dance music: that Seventies analogue warmth, those fat Eighties beats and that meticulous Nineties programming.&quot; Nick DeCicco of &quot;Daily Republic&quot; also compared the record to the works of Air, Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Moby. The album features vocals by Anneli Drecker and Erlend Øye.

The first track &quot;So Easy&quot;, described as &quot;eerie&quot;, samples the refrain from Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;Blue on Blue&quot;, said to be &quot;recorded by some long-forgotten vocal chorus&quot; and has &quot;a chunky bassline&quot; underneath. The second track &quot;Eple&quot;, has &quot;a high-pitched sonic tickle that falls in and out of pitch&quot;, and &quot;is pushed through with acoustic guitar and sluggish drums&quot; The &quot;slow R&amp;B&quot; track &quot;Sparks&quot;, said to be a &quot;toned-down&quot; Portishead&quot;, has &quot;Drecker&#x27;s vocals drift and hang over the lush bass lines and airy guitar riffs.&quot; The &quot;gentle drum and bass&quot; track &quot;In Space&quot; has &quot;rippling harps over sighing, sampled strings&quot; &quot;Poor Leno&quot; is a house song where Øye sings &quot;a lullaby hook over a rich, subtly mutating&quot; groove.

&quot;A Higher Place&quot; is a downtempo track with &quot;phosphorescent synth chords and a stinging guitar loop&quot;. The next track &quot;Royksopp&#x27;s Night Out&quot; is described as &quot;tense, cinematic funk&quot;, where the band &quot;allow themselves to break into a free-flowing and slightly less restrained darkness.&quot; &quot;Remind Me&quot; is a club track influenced by acid house and explores easy listening music with &quot;playground keyboard refrains and 60s vocal melody&quot;. It also has &quot;squiggly bass lines, melancholic synth effects, and dreamy male vocals.&quot; The next track &quot;She&#x27;s So&quot;, a track with &quot;mournful saxophone and arcing synths to recall the dated tones of Tangerine Dream&quot;, &quot;places the swooning moogs and strings of Air&quot; with an &quot;otherworldliness&quot; texture &quot;reminiscent of Vangelis&#x27; soundtrack to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.&quot; The album closes with &quot;40 Years Back/Come&quot;, a track with an &quot;&#x27;80s sense of artificial ethereality&quot; and &quot;spindly, etiolated synth lines around rasping, squelchy beats before closing with warm fretless bass.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Melody A.M.&quot; was met with universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 21 reviews.

Andy Battaglia of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the album &quot;a highly imaginative entry into the saturated realm of downtempo chill-out music.&quot; Writing for &quot;Launch&quot;, Ken Micallef wrote that &quot;Röyksopp spins ambient trip hop into bedazzled and beautiful winter Muzak.&quot; Ethan Brown remarked that the album &quot;will at least remind some of its eccentric possibilities. Like Björk&#x27;s &quot;Vespertine&quot; or bedroom auteurs like Luke Vibert, &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; wires us into a highly personal, almost cocoonlike sonic sensibility.&quot; The album &quot;settles into a stream of pastoral, boutique techno that’s both soothing and derivative&quot;, according to David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

Abebe Nitsuh of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; considered &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; to be &quot;the most solid, confident, and generally pleasurable downtempo full-length you&#x27;ll be hearing for a while. Whether that means it&#x27;s a must-buy, more well-meaning nondescript bubbling, or end-of-the-world car-commercial music has to be left to you.&quot; However, he said that the worst moments of the album is when the duo &quot;go generically downtempo and then miss the mark&quot;. DeCicco found the album unoriginal, continuing that &quot;there isn’t much here that wasn’t done better and more interestingly at the height of downtempo’s popularity than it was by Röyksopp’s contemporaries.&quot;

On 21 November 2007, the album was included on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s series of the 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die. It is also listed in a similar selection, called &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, in a series of books by Quintessence Editions. On 24 November 2009, &quot;Melody A.M.&quot; was named the best Norwegian album of the 2000s decade by the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot;.

<text>4X (abbreviation of &quot;Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate&quot;) is a subgenre of strategy-based computer and board games, and includes both turn-based and real-time strategy titles. The gameplay generally involves building an empire. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of military and non-military routes to supremacy.

The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games were also common. Many 4X computer games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot; is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.

In the board (and card) game domain, 4X is less of a distinct genre, in part because of the practical constraints of components and playing time. The &quot;Civilization&quot; board game that gave rise to Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot;, for instance, includes neither exploration nor extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.

==Definition==
The term &quot;4X&quot; originates from a 1993 preview of &quot;Master of Orion&quot; in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; by game writer Alan Emrich where he rated the game &quot;XXXX&quot; as a pun on the XXX rating for pornography. The four Xs were an abbreviation for &quot;EXplore, EXpand, EXploit and EXterminate&quot;. Emrich wrote, &quot;Quadruple-X - I give MOO a XXXX rating because it features the essential four X&#x27;s of any good strategic conquest game: EXplore, EXpand, EXploit and EXterminate. In other words, players must rise from humble beginnings, finding their way around the map while building up the largest, most efficient empire possible. Naturally, the other players will be trying to do the same, therefore their extermination becomes a paramount concern. A classic situation, indeed, and when the various parts are properly designed, other X’s seem to follow. Words like EXcite, EXperiment and EXcuses (to one’s significant others) must be added to a gamer’s X-Rating list.&quot; It is unknown if this is first use of the term &quot;4x&quot;.

By February 1994, another author in the magazine said that &quot;Command Adventures: Starship&quot; &quot;only pays lip service to the four Xs&quot;, and other game commentators adopted the &quot;4X&quot; label to describe similar games.

The 4X game genre has come to be defined as having the four following gameplay conventions:
* &quot;Explore&quot; means players send scouts across a map to reveal surrounding territories.
* &quot;Expand&quot; means players claim new territory by creating new settlements, or sometimes by extending the influence of existing settlements.
* &quot;Exploit&quot; means players gather and use resources in areas they control, and improve the efficiency of that usage.
* &quot;Exterminate&quot; means attacking and eliminating rival players. Since in some games all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival&#x27;s presence may be the only way to achieve further expansion.

These gameplay elements may happen in separate phases of gameplay, or may overlap with each other over varying lengths of game time depending on game design. For example, the &quot;Space Empires&quot; series and &quot;Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar&quot; have a long expansion phase, because players must make large investments in research to explore and expand into all areas.

Emrich later expanded his concept for designing &quot;Master of Orion 3&quot; with a fifth X, eXperience, an aspect that came with the subject matter of the game.

===Modern definition===

In modern-day usage, 4X games are different from other strategy games such as&quot; Command &amp; Conquer&quot; by their greater complexity and scale, and their complex use of diplomacy.

Reviewers have also said that 4X games feature a range of diplomatic options, and that they are well known for their large detailed empires and complex gameplay. In particular, 4X games offer detailed control over an empire&#x27;s economy, while other computer strategy games simplify this in favor of combat-focused gameplay.

==Game design==

4X computer and board games are a subgenre of strategy games, and include both turn-based and real-time strategy titles. The gameplay involves building an empire, which takes place in a setting such as Earth, a fantasy world, or in space. Each player takes control of a different civilization or race with unique characteristics and strengths. Most 4X games give each faction unique economic and military bonuses.

===Research and technology===

4X games typically feature a technology tree, which represents a series of advancements that players can unlock to gain new units, buildings, and other capabilities. Technology trees in 4X games are typically larger than in other strategy games, featuring a larger selection of different choices. Empires must generate research resources and invest them in new technology. In 4X games, the main prerequisite for researching an advanced technology is knowledge of earlier technology. This is in contrast to non-4X real-time strategy games, where technological progress is achieved by building structures that grant access to more advanced structures and units.

Research is important in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.

===Combat===
Combat is an important part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game&#x27;s universe. Some 4X games, such as &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot;, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.

===Peaceful competition===
4X games allow rival players to engage in diplomacy. While some strategy games may offer shared victory and team play, diplomatic relations tend to be restricted to a binary choice between an ally or enemy. 4X games often allow more complex diplomatic relations between competitors who are not on the same team. Aside from making allies and enemies, players are also able to trade resources and information with rivals.

In addition to victory through conquest, 4X games offer peaceful victory conditions or goals that involve no extermination of rival players (although war may still be a necessary by-product of reaching said goal). For example, a 4X game may offer victory to a player who achieves a certain score or the highest score after a certain number of turns. Many 4X games award victory to the first player to master an advanced technology, accumulate a large amount of culture, or complete an awe-inspiring achievement. Several 4X games award &quot;diplomatic victory&quot; to anyone who can win an election decided by their rival players, or maintain peace for a specified number of turns.
Galactic Civilizations has a diplomatic victory which involves having alliances with at least four factions, with no factions outside of one&#x27;s alliance; there are two ways to accomplish this: ally with all factions, or ally with at least the minimum number of factions and destroy the rest.

===Complexity===
4X games are known for their complex gameplay and strategic depth. Gameplay usually takes priority over elaborate graphics. Whereas other strategy games focus on combat, 4X games also offer more detailed control over diplomacy, economics, and research; creating opportunities for diverse strategies. This also challenges the player to manage several strategies simultaneously, and plan for long-term objectives.

To experience a detailed model of a large empire, 4X games are designed with a complex set of game rules. For example, the player&#x27;s productivity may be limited by pollution. Players may need to balance a budget, such as managing debt, or paying down maintenance costs. 4X games often model political challenges such as civil disorder, or a senate that can oust the player&#x27;s political party or force them to make peace.

Such complexity requires players to manage a larger amount of information than other strategy games. Game designers often organize empire management into different interface screens and modes, such as a separate screen for diplomacy, managing individual settlements, and managing battle tactics. Sometimes systems are intricate enough to resemble a minigame. This is in contrast to most real-time strategy games. &quot;Dune II&quot;, which arguably established the conventions for the real-time strategy genre, was fundamentally designed to be a &quot;flat interface&quot;, with no additional screens.

===Gameplay===

Since 4X games involve managing a large, detailed empire, game sessions usually last longer than other strategy games. Game sessions may require several hours of play-time, which can be particularly problematic for multiplayer matches. For example, a small-scale game in &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot; can last longer than twelve hours. However, fans of the genre often expect and embrace these long game sessions; Emrich wrote that &quot;when the various parts are properly designed, other X&#x27;s seem to follow. Words like EXcite, EXperiment and EXcuses (to one&#x27;s significant others)&quot;. Turn-based 4X games typically divide these sessions into hundreds of turns of gameplay.

Because of repetitive actions and long-playing times, 4X games have been criticized for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire&#x27;s numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony&#x27;s build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game&#x27;s use of programmable governors. &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot; was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game&#x27;s interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, &quot;Master of Orion III&quot; reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.

===Victory conditions===
Most 4X and similar strategy games feature multiple possible ways to win the game. For example, in &quot;Civilization&quot;, players may win through total domination of all opposing players by conquest of their cities, but may also win through technological achievements (being the first to launch a spacecraft to a new planet), diplomacy (being elected the world leader by other nations), or other means. Multiple victory conditions help to support the human player who may have to shift strategies as the game progresses and opponents secure key resources before the player can. However, these multiple conditions can also give the computer-controlled opponents multiple pathways to potentially outwit the player, who is generally going to be over-powered in certain areas over the computer opponents. A component of the late-game design in 4X games is forcing the player to commit to a specific victory condition by making the cost and resources required to secure it so great that other possible victory conditions may need to be passed over.

==History==
===Origin===
Early 4X games were influenced by board games, such as Stellar Conquest published by Metagaming Concepts in 1974, and text-based computer games from the 1970s. &quot;Cosmic Balance II&quot;, &quot;Andromeda Conquest&quot; and &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although &quot;Andromeda Conquest&quot; was only a simple game of empire expansion, &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest. &quot;Trade Wars&quot;, first released in 1984, though primarily regarded as the first multiplayer space trader, included space exploration, resource management, empire building, expansion and conquest. It has been cited by the author of &quot;VGA Planets&quot; as an important influence on &quot;VGA Planets 4&quot;.

In 1991, Sid Meier released &quot;Civilization&quot; and popularized the level of detail that has become common in the genre. &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; was influenced by board games such as &quot;Risk&quot; and the Avalon Hill board game also called &quot;Civilization&quot;. A notable similarity between the &quot;Civilization&quot; computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; was also influenced by personal computer games, such as the city management game &quot;SimCity&quot; and the wargame &quot;Empire&quot;. &quot;Civilization&quot; became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; compared its importance to computer gaming to that of the wheel. &quot;Armada 2525&quot; was also released in 1991 and was cited by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as the best space game of the year. A sequel, &quot;Armada 2526&quot;, was released in 2009.

In 1991, two highly influential space games were released. &quot;VGA Planets&quot; was released for the PC, while &quot;Spaceward Ho!&quot; was released on the Macintosh. Although 4X space games were ultimately more influenced by the complexity of &quot;VGA Planets&quot;, &quot;Spaceward Ho!&quot; earned praise for its relatively simple yet challenging game design. &quot;Spaceward Ho!&quot; is notable for its similarity to the 1993 game &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, with its simple yet deep gameplay. &quot;Master of Orion&quot; drew upon earlier 4X games such as &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;, and is considered a classic game that sets a new standard for the genre. In a preview of &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, Emrich coined the term &quot;XXXX&quot; to describe the emerging genre. Eventually, the &quot;4X&quot; label was adopted by the game industry, and is now applied to several earlier game releases.

===Peak===
Following the success of &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, other developers began releasing their own 4X games. In 1994, Stardock launched its first version of the &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; series for OS/2, and the long-standing &quot;Space Empires&quot; series began as shareware. &quot;Ascendancy&quot; and &quot;Stars!&quot; were released in 1995, and both continued the genre&#x27;s emphasis on strategic depth and empire management. Meanwhile, the &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;Master of Orion&quot; franchises expanded their market with versions for the Macintosh. Sid Meier&#x27;s team also produced &quot;Colonization&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Civilization II&quot; in 1996, while Simtex released &quot;Master of Orion&quot; in 1993, &quot;Master of Magic&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Master of Orion II&quot; in 1996.

By the late 1990s, real-time strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier&#x27;s Firaxis Games released &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; in 1999 to critical acclaim, but the game fell short of commercial expectations. &quot;Civilization III&quot; encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over &quot;Master of Orion III&quot;, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.

===Recent history===
Firaxis has continued to develop the &quot;Civilization&quot; series, with &quot;Civilization IV&quot; (2005), &quot;Civilization V&quot; (2010), and &quot;Civilization VI&quot; (2016), along with expansion packs for each. &quot;Civilization VII&quot; is set to be released on February 11, 2025. Among major changes to the series have been new victory conditions, switching from a square to a hex-based grid, de-stacking military units to encourage more strategic battles, and more customizable options for governance and culture. Firaxis also developed &quot;Civilization Revolution&quot; (2008) and its sequel (2014) as lightweight, console-friendly versions of 4X games, but brought the full &quot;Civilization&quot; experience to consoles with &quot;Civilization VI&quot;. Firaxis also developed a spiritual sequel to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; with &quot;&quot; (2014). As of 2021, the &quot;Civilization&quot; series has sold more than 57 million units.

The &quot;Total War&quot; series remains in development, with the latest title, &quot;Total War: Pharaoh&quot; released in 2023.

Stardock entered the market through a remake of the 1993 OS/2 game, &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; (2003), a space-themed 4X game. The game was successful and was compared favorably to &quot;Master of Orion&quot;, and led Stardock to continue the series with &quot;Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords&quot; (2007), &quot;Galactic Civilizations III&quot; (2015), and &quot;Galactic Civilizations IV&quot; (2022).

Paradox Interactive is a company that was spun out from developing video game adaptions of board games from Target Games. Through 2000 and 2003, the company began producing their own grand strategy video games, which included the &quot;Europa Universalis&quot; series dealing with conflicts in early modern Europe, the &quot;Crusader Kings&quot; series set in the Middle Ages, the &quot;&quot; series set in the Victorian period, and the &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; series involving World War II. These series, as of 2023, remain under active development at Paradox, along with &quot;Stellaris&quot; (2016), a grand strategy title based on space conflict. Paradox also acquired the &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; series, which is a 4X series based on a high fantasy world that includes elements of magic.

Amplitude Studios entered the 4X venue with &quot;Endless Space&quot; (2012) and its sequel (2017), &quot;Endless Legend&quot; (2014), and &quot;Humankind&quot; (2021).

The 4X genre has also been extended by gamers who have supported free software releases such as &quot;Freeciv&quot;, &quot;FreeCol&quot;, &quot;Freeorion&quot;, &quot;Golden Age of Civilizations&quot;, and &quot;C-evo&quot;. Indie game developers have also contributed towards the 4X genre during the 2010s and 2020s.

==Subgenres==
===Grand strategy games===
Grand strategy games, such as &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot;, &quot;Crusader Kings&quot;, or &quot;Stellaris&quot;, are a sub-genre or sister genre of 4X that typically require even more detailed planning and execution than games like &quot;Civilization&quot; or &quot;Master of Orion&quot;. Within the realm of tabletop wargaming where grand strategy games originate, they are conventionally defined as those games in which the player governs all the capacities of a nation-state, including its economy, diplomacy, and internal politics, with a focus on grand strategy (a nation-state&#x27;s generalised prerogative in defining and pursuing its interests on the world stage), as against games where the player mostly commands the military during wartime. In computer gaming, this definition holds considerable overlap with that of 4X games, thus a more restrictive set of defining traits are usually used.

Grand strategy games are typically more strategically open than 4X games, which often have well-defined, instantaneous victory conditions such as &quot;conquer everyone&quot; or &quot;win the space race&quot;. Grand strategy games typically lack such victory conditions and instead scope themselves over a definite period of time, with specific starting and ending dates. As in 4X games, players are usually ranked on their overall achievements at the end of a campaign, and in grand strategies this is usually the only factor accounted for in victory. This results in longer, more complex and free-form campaigns structured largely by player-driven goals.

Grand strategy games also differ from traditional 4X games in being &quot;asymmetrical&quot;, meaning that players are bound to play out specific (often historical) starting conditions, rather than play as a set of equally free factions exploring and progressing in an open world. For example, 4X Civilization starts all players on equal footing, as small tribes in a largely ahistoric wilderness, while grand strategies seek to at least approximately represent the actual conditions of their time period, even when those are not fairly balanced toward all players.

The open-ended, sprawling, and convoluted nature of grand strategy campaigns makes even major asymmetries strategically tractable: with no hard victory conditions, players in grand strategy games are not implicitly engaged to compete in a race to the finish. As there is no way for players to &quot;rush&quot; toward instant victory thresholds (military or otherwise), and thus no simple way for any one player to credibly brandish the threat of imminent and irremediable defeat against the others, contest in grand strategies typically emerges more organically than in 4X games, when and where it is geopolitically meaningful, rather than as the inevitable outcome of a game&#x27;s initial configuration as a battle royal.

===Real-time hybrid 4X===
Eventually real-time 4X games were released, such as &quot;Imperium Galactica&quot; in 1997, &quot;Starships Unlimited&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Sword of the Stars&quot; in 2006, featuring a combination of turn-based strategy and real-time tactical combat. The blend of 4X and real-time strategy gameplay led Ironclad Games to market their 2008 release &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot; as a &quot;RT4X&quot; game. This combination of features earned the game a mention as one of the top games from 2008, including GameSpot&#x27;s award for best strategy game, and IGN&#x27;s award for best PC game. The &quot;Total War&quot; series, debuting in 2000 with &quot;&quot;, combines a turn-based campaign map and real-time tactical battles.

== 4X in board games ==
Cross-fertilization between board games and video games continued. For example, some aspects of &quot;Master of Orion III&quot; were drawn from the first edition of the board game &quot;Twilight Imperium&quot;. Even &quot;Sins of a Solar Empire&quot; was inspired by the idea of adapting the board game &quot;Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century&quot; into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, in 2002 Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization,&quot; entitled simply &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization: The Boardgame&quot;, significantly different from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place. Another remake based on that series, under a very similar title, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization: The Board Game&quot;, was released in 2010 by Fantasy Flight Games, followed by &quot;&quot; in 2017.

&quot;Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization&quot; is a board game for 2–4 players designed by Vlaada Chvatil and published by Czech Board Games in 2006. Its theme is the development of human civilization and the players determine the progress of their own civilization in different fields including culture, government, leadership, religion and science. The game won multiple awards including the &quot;International Gamers Awards&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; in Poland in 2010, where it was published as &quot;Cywilizacja: Poprzez Wieki&quot;. &quot;Scythe&quot; is a board game for one to five players designed by Jamey Stegmaier and published by Stonemaier Games in 2016. Set in an alternate history version of 1920s Europe, players control factions that produce resources, develop economic infrastructure, and use dieselpunk war machines, called &quot;mechs&quot;, to engage in combat and control territories. Players take up to two actions per turn using individual player boards, and the game proceeds until one player has earned six achievements. At this point, the players receive coins for the achievements they have attained and the territories they control, and the player with the most coins is declared the winner. , BoardGameGeek listed slightly over 200 board games classified under 4X type, including titles such as &quot;Eclipse&quot; (2011) and &quot;Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea&quot; (2018).

<text>The Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) was an industry consortium created in 2002 and chartered to promote interoperability amongst the stack of web services specifications. WS-I did not define standards for web services; rather, it created guidelines and tests for interoperability. 
In July 2010, WS-I joined the OASIS, standardization consortium as a member section. 
It operated until December 2017. 
The WS-I standards were then maintained by relevant technical committees within OASIS.

It was governed by a board of directors consisting of the founding members (IBM, Microsoft, BEA Systems, SAP, Oracle, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel) and two elected members (Sun Microsystems and webMethods). After it joined OASIS, other organizations have joined the WS-I technical committee including CA Technologies, JumpSoft and Booz Allen Hamilton. 

The organization&#x27;s deliverables included profiles, sample applications that demonstrate the profiles&#x27; use, and test tools to help determine profile conformance.

== WS-I Profiles ==

According to WS-I, a profile is
A set of named web services specifications at specific revision levels, together with a set of implementation and interoperability guidelines recommending how the specifications may be used to develop interoperable web services.

* WS-I Basic Profile
* WS-I Basic Security Profile
* Simple Soap Binding Profile

== WS-I Profile Compliance ==

The WS-I is not a certifying authority; thus, every vendor can claim to be compliant to a profile. However the use of the test tool is required before a company can claim a product to be compliant. See WS-I Trademarks and Compliance claims requirements

<doc id="705622" wikidata="Q603161" url="?curid=705622" title="Hukvaldy">
<text>Hukvaldy () is a municipality and village in Frýdek-Místek District in the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,200 inhabitants. It is known for the ruins of the third-largest castle in the Czech Republic, Hukvaldy Castle, and is the birthplace of the composer Leoš Janáček.

==Administrative division==
Hukvaldy consists of five municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Hukvaldy (542)
*Dolní Sklenov (586)
*Horní Sklenov (205)
*Krnalovice (89)
*Rychaltice (683)
==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Hückeswagen family, who were the first owners of Hukvaldy.

==Geography==
Hukvaldy is located about southwest of Frýdek-Místek and south of Ostrava. It lies in the Moravian-Silesian Foothills. The highest point is the hill Babí hora at above sea level. The Ondřejnice River flows through the municipality.

==History==

The Hukvaldy Castle was founded in the 1270s or 1280s by the Hückeswagen family and was first mentioned in 1285. It was a guard castle on the trade route from Olomouc to Kraków. The settlement of Hukvaldy was soon established nearby. The settlement of Sklenov was established under the castle and was first documented in 1294.

Between 1294 and 1307, the Hukvaldy estate was acquired by the bishops of Olomouc, who often pledged it to various noblemen. In the following centuries, the castle was expanded into a massive fortress. In 1762, the castle was destroyed by a fire. In the following decades, the castle was dismantled as a source of building material. Repairs began in the 1960s.

The municipality was known as Sklenov until 1982. Since 1 July 1982, it has been named Hukvaldy.

==Demographics==
==Transport==

The D48 motorway (part of the European route E462) from Nový Jičín to the Czech-Polish border passes through the northern part of the municipality.

==Culture==
Until 2017, &quot;Janáček&#x27;s Hukvaldy&quot; music festival took place in Hukvaldy. Since 2018, it has been a part of the &quot;Leoš Janáček International Music Festival&quot; in Ostrava. It is one of the most important classical music festivals in the Czech Republic.

==Sights==

Hukvaldy Castle is the third largest castle in the country. It is gradually being reconstructed. There is an exhibition on the history and architectural development of the castle. Accessible are also well-preserved guard rooms, or the Baroque Chapel of St. Andrew used for concerts. Part of the palace was converted into a lookout tower.

The castle is surrounded by a game park, founded in the 16th century. It is home to fallow deers, mouflons and wild boars. In the game park is an amphitheatre and the Monument of Bystrouška from Janáček&#x27;s opera &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;.

==Notable people==
*Jan Čapek of Sány (c. 1390 – c. 1452), nobleman and military officer; owned the castle and probably died here
*Friedrich Egon von Fürstenberg (1813–1892), archbishop of Olomouc; died here
*Leoš Janáček (1854–1928), composer

<text>Pearl Eileen Primus (November 29, 1919 – October 29, 1994) was an American dancer, choreographer and anthropologist. Primus played an important role in the presentation of African dance to American audiences. Early in her career she saw the need to promote African dance as an art form worthy of study and performance. Primus&#x27; work was a reaction to myths of savagery and the lack of knowledge about African people. It was an effort to guide the Western world to view African dance as an important and dignified statement about another way of life.

==Background==

Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Pearl Primus was two years old when she moved with her parents, Edward Primus and Emily Jackson, to New York City in 1921. In 1940, Primus received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Hunter College in biology and pre-medical science. As a graduate student in biology, she realized that her dreams of becoming a medical researcher would be unfulfilled, due to racial discrimination at the time that imposed limitations on jobs in the science field for people of color. Because of society&#x27;s limitations, Primus was unable to find a job as a laboratory technician and she could not fund herself through medical school, so she picked up odd jobs. Eventually Primus sought help from the National Youth Administration and they gave her a job working backstage in the wardrobe department for &quot;America Dances&quot;. Once a spot became available for a dancer, Primus was hired as an understudy, thus beginning her first theatrical experience. She discovered her innate gift for movement, and she was quickly recognized for her abilities. Within a year, Primus auditioned and won a scholarship for the New Dance Group, a left-wing school and performance company located on the Lower East Side of New York City.

==Career==

Primus began her formal study of dance with the New Dance Group in 1941, she was the group&#x27;s first black student. She trained under the group&#x27;s founders, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, and William Bates. Through this organization, Primus not only gained a foundation for her contemporary technique, but she learned about artistic activism. The New Dance Group&#x27;s motto was &quot;dance is a weapon of the class struggle&quot;, they instilled the belief that dance is a conscious art and those who view it should be impacted. The organization trained dancers like Primus to be aware of the political and social climate of their time. Primus&#x27; exposure to this newfound form of activism encouraged the themes of social protest found in her works.

Primus continued to develop her modern dance foundation with several pioneers such Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, Ismay Andrews, and Asadata Dafora. Amongst these influencers, Dafora&#x27;s influence on Primus has been largely ignored by historians and unmentioned by Primus. However, Marcia Ethel Heard notes that he instilled a sense of African pride in his students and asserts that he taught Primus about African dance and culture. Dafora began a movement of African cultural pride which provided Primus with collaborators and piqued public interest in her work.

Primus explored African culture and dance by consulting family, books, articles, pictures, and museums. After six months of thorough research, she completed her first major composition entitled &quot;African Ceremonial&quot;. This piece served as an introduction to her swelling interest in Black heritage. She based the dance on a legend from the Belgian Congo, about a priest who performed a fertility ritual until he collapsed and vanished. This thoroughly researched composition was presented along with &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, &quot;Rock Daniel&quot;, and &quot;Hard Time Blues&quot;, at her debut performance on February 14, 1943, at the 92nd Street YMHA. Her performance was so outstanding that John Martin, a major dance critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;she was entitled to a company of her own.&quot; John Martin admired her stage presence, energy, and technique. He described her as a remarkable and distinguished artist.
After gaining much praise, Primus&#x27; next performances began in April 1943, as an entertainer at the famous racially integrated night club, Cafe Society Downtown. For 10 months her energy and emotion commanded the stage, along with her stunning five-foot-high jumps. She continued to amaze audiences when she performed at the Negro Freedom Rally, in June 1943, at Madison Square Garden before an audience of 20,000 people. 
 In December 1943, Primus appeared as in Dafora&#x27;s African Dance Festival at Carnegie Hall before Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune. Within the same month, Primus, who was primarily a solo artist, recruited other dances and formed the Primus Company. The company performed in concerts at the Roxy Theatre. &quot;African Ceremonial&quot; was re-envisioned for the group&#x27;s performance. At that time, Primus&#x27; African choreography could be termed interpretive, based on the research she conducted and her perception of her findings. Primus would choreograph based on imagining the movement of something she observed, such as an African sculpture.

Over time Primus developed an interest in the way dance represented the lives of people in a culture. Primus was also intrigued by the relationship between the African-slave diaspora and different types of cultural dances. With an enlarged range of interest, Primus began to conduct some field studies. In the summer of 1944, Primus visited the Deep South to research the culture and dances of Southern blacks. She posed as a migrant worker with the aim &quot;to know [her] own people where they are suffering the most.&quot; She observed and participated in the daily lives of black impoverished sharecroppers. Primus fully engulfed herself in the experience by attending over seventy churches and picking cotton with the sharecroppers. After her field research, Primus was able to establish new choreography while continuously developing some of her former innovative works.

Primus made her Broadway debut on October 4, 1944, at the Bealson Theatre. Here she performed a work that was choreographed to Langston Hughes&#x27; poem &quot;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot;. The poem addressed the inequalities and injustices imposed on the black community, while introducing comparisons between the ancestry of Black people to four major rivers. Primus&#x27; dance to this poem boldly acknowledged the strength and wisdom of African Americans through periods of freedom and enslavement.

In 1945 she continued to develop &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1945) one of the pieces she debuted in 1943. This dance was based on the poem by Lewis Allan about a lynching. When analyzing the dance, one can see that the performer is portraying a female character&#x27;s reaction after witnessing a lynching. Many viewers wondered about the race of the anguished woman, but Primus declared that the woman was a member of the lynch mob. &quot;The dance begins as the last person begins to leave the lynching ground and the horror of what she has seen grips her, and she has to do a smooth, fast roll away from that burning flesh.&quot; Primus depicts the aftermath of the lynching through the remorse of the woman, after she realized the horrible nature of the act. The intention of this piece introduces the idea that even a lynch mob can show penitence.

Primus&#x27; work continued to push boundaries as she re-developed another one of her debut pieces, &quot;Hard Time Blues&quot; (1945). She choreographed this dance to a song by folk singer Josh White. The choreography for this piece, which was made in protest of sharecropping, truly represented Primus&#x27; movement style. This piece was embellished with athletic jumps that defied gravity and amazed audiences. But Primus explained that jumping does not always symbolize joy. In this case, her powerful jumping symbolized the defiance, desperation, and anger of the sharecroppers which she experienced first-hand during her field studies. Primus believed that when observing the jumps in the choreography, it was important to pay attention to &quot;the shape the body takes in the air&quot;. For Hard Time Blues, the shape of the body was a predictor of the emotional state of the poor sharecroppers.

In 1946, Primus continued her journey on Broadway was invited to appear in the revival of the Broadway production &quot;Show Boat&quot;, choreographed by Helen Tamiris. Then, she was asked to choreograph a Broadway production called &quot;Calypso&quot; whose title became &quot;Caribbean Carnival&quot;. She also appeared at the Chicago Theatre in the 1947 revival of the &quot;Emperor Jones&quot; in the &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; role that Hemsley Winfield made famous.

In 1947 Primus joined Jacob&#x27;s Pillow and began her own program in which she reprised some of her works such as &quot;Hard Time Blues. &quot; In her program she also presented Three Spirituals entitled &quot;Motherless Child&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; to tell God all my Trouble&quot;, and &quot;In the Great Gettin&#x27;-up Mornin&#x27;.&quot; These pieces were rooted in Primus&#x27; experience with black southern culture. This cannon of Negro spirituals, also referred to as &quot;sorrow songs&quot; branched from slave culture, which at the time was a prominent source of inspiration for many contemporary dance artists.

Following this show and many subsequent recitals, Primus toured the nation with The Primus Company. While on the university and college circuit, Primus performed at Fisk University in 1948, where Dr. Charles S. Johnson, a member of Rosenwald Foundation board, was president. He was so impressed with the power of her interpretive African dances that he asked her when she had last visited Africa. She replied that she had never done so. She then became the last recipient of the major Rosenwald fellowships and received the most money ($4000) ever given. After receiving this funding, Primus originally proposed to develop a dance project based on James Weldon Johnsons work &quot;God&#x27;s Trombones. But instead she decided to conduct an 18-month research and study tour of the Gold Coast, Angola, Cameroons, Liberia, Senegal and the Belgian Congo. On December 5, 1948, Primus closed a successful return engagement at the Café Society nightclub in New York City before heading off to Africa.

Primus was so well accepted in the communities in her study tour that she was told that the ancestral spirit of an African dancer had manifested in her. The Oni and people of Ife, Nigeria, felt that she was so much a part of their community that they initiated her into their commonwealth and affectionately conferred on her the title &quot;Omowale&quot; — the child who has returned home. During her travels in the villages of Africa, Primus was declared a man so that she could learn the dances only assigned to males. She mastered dances like the war dance Bushasche, and Fanga which were common to African cultural life.

When Primus returned to America, she took the knowledge she gained in Africa and staged pieces for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre. In 1974, Primus staged &quot;Fanga&quot; created in 1949 which was a Liberian dance of welcome that quickly made its way into Primus&#x27;s iconic repertoire. She also staged &quot;The Wedding&quot; created in 1961. These pieces were based on the African rituals Primus experienced during her travels. Primus took these traditionally long rituals, dramatized them, made them shorter, and preserved the foundation of the movement .

Primus learned a plethora in Africa, but she was still eager to further her academic knowledge, Primus received her PhD in anthropology from New York University (NYU) in 1978. In 1979, she and her husband Percival Borde, whom she met during her research in Trinidad, founded the Pearl Primus &quot;Dance Language Institute&quot; in New Rochelle, New York, where they offered classes that blended African-American, Caribbean, and African dance forms with modern dance and ballet techniques. They also established a performance group was called &quot;Earth Theatre&quot;.

As an artist/ educator, Primus taught at a number of universities during her career including NYU, Hunter College, the State University of New York at Purchase, the College of New Rochelle, Iona College, the State University of New York at Buffalo, Howard University, the Five Colleges consortium in Massachusetts. She also taught at New Rochelle High School, assisting with cultural presentations. As an anthropologist, she conducted cultural projects in Europe, Africa and America for such organizations as the Ford Foundation, US Office of Education, New York University, Universalist Unitarian Service Committee, Julius Rosenwald Foundation, New York State Office of Education, and the Council for the Arts in Westchester.

==Legacy==

===Pioneer of African dance in the United States===
Primus&#x27; sojourn to West Africa has proven invaluable to students of African dance. She learned more about African dance, its function and meaning than had any other American before her. Primus was known as a griot, the voice of cultures in which dance is embedded. She was able to codify the technical details of many of the African dances through the notation system she evolved and was also able to view and to salvage some &quot;still existent gems of dances before they faded into general decadence.&quot; She has been unselfish in sharing the knowledge she has gained with others.

The significance of Primus&#x27; African research and choreography lies in her presentation of a dance history which embraces ethnic unity, the establishment of an articulate foundation for influencing future practitioners of African dance, the presentation of African dance forms into a disciplined expression, and the enrichment of American theater through the performance of African dance.

Additionally, Primus and the late Percival Borde, her husband and partner, conducted research with the Liberian Konama Kende Performing Arts Center to establish a performing arts center, and with a Rebekah Harkness Foundation grant to organize and direct dance performances in several counties during the period of 1959 to 1962. Primus and Borde taught African dance artists how to make their indigenous dances theatrically entertaining and acceptable to the western world, and also arranged projects between African countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and the United States Government to bring touring companies to this country.

===Choreography approach and style===
Primus&#x27; approach to developing a movement language and to creating dance works parallels that of Graham, Holm, Weidman, Agnes de Mille and others who are considered to be pioneers of American modern dance. These artists searched literature, used music of contemporary composers, glorified regional idiosyncrasies and looked to varied ethnic groups for potential sources of creative material.

Primus, however, found her creative impetus in the cultural heritage of the African American. She gained a lot of information from her family who enlightened her about their West Indian roots and African lineage. The stories and memories told to young Pearl, established a cultural and historical heritage for her and laid the foundation for her creative works. Primus&#x27; extensive field studies in the South and in Africa was also a key resource for her. She made sure to preserve the traditional forms of expression that she observed. In this way she differed from other dance groups who altered the African dances that they incorporated into their movements. Her view of &quot;dance as a form of life&quot; supported her decision to keep her choreography real and authentic.

Primus fused spirituals, jazz and blues, then coupled these music forms with the literary works of black writers, and her choreographic voice — though strong — resonated primarily for and to the black community. Her many works &#x27;Strange Fruit&#x27;, &quot;Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot;, &quot;Hard Time Blues&quot;, and more spoke on very socially important topics. Her creative endeavors in political and social change makes Primus arguably one of the most political choreographers of her time because of her awareness of the issues of African Americans, particularly during the period between World War I and II.

Primus was a powerhouse dancer, whose emotions, exuberance, and five-foot-high athletic jumps wowed every audience she performed for. Her performance of &quot;Hard Time Blues&quot; was described by Margaret Lloyd: &quot;Pearl takes a running jump, lands in an upper corner and sits there, unconcernedly paddling the air with her legs. She does it repeatedly, from one side of the stage, then the other, apparently unaware of the involuntary gasps from the audience...&quot; Primus&#x27; athleticism made her choreography awe-striking. She preserved traditional movements but added her own style which includes modified pelvic rotations and rhythmic variations. As she moved Primus carried intensity and displayed passion while simultaneously bringing awareness to social issues.

Primus&#x27; strong belief that rich choreographic material lay in abundance in the root experiences of a people has been picked up and echoed in the rhythm and themes of Alvin Ailey, Donald McKayle, Talley Beatty, Dianne McIntyre, Elo Pomare and others. Her work has also been reimagined and recycled into different versions by contemporary artists. Many choreographers, such as Jawolle Willa Jo Zollar, created projects inspired by Primus&#x27; work. Primus choreography which included bent knees, the isolation and articulation of body parts, and rhythmically percussive movement, can be observed in the movement of Zollar and many others. These similarities show that Primus&#x27; style, themes, and body type promoted the display of Black culture within the dance community.

==Personal life and death==

Pearl married Yael Woll in 1950, Manhattan, New York. They were divorced by 1957.

Primus married the dancer, drummer, and choreographer Percival Borde in 1961, and began a collaboration that ended only with his death in 1979. In 1959, the year Primus received an M.A. in education from New York University, she traveled to Liberia, where she worked with the National Dance Company there to create &quot;Fanga&quot;, an interpretation of a traditional Liberian invocation to the earth and sky.

Primus believed in sound research. Her meticulous search of libraries and museums and her use of living source materials established her as a dance scholar.

Primus focused on matters such as oppression, racial prejudice, and violence. Her efforts were also subsidized by the United States government who encouraged African-American artistic endeavors.

Primus died from diabetes at her home in New Rochelle, New York, on October 29, 1994.

==Recognition==

In 1991, President George H. W. Bush honored Primus with the National Medal of Arts. She was the recipient of numerous other honors including: The cherished Liberian Government Decoration, &quot;Star of Africa&quot;; The Scroll of Honor from the National Council of Negro Women; The Pioneer of Dance Award from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre; Membership in Phi Beta Kappa; an honorary doctorate from Spelman College; the first Balasaraswati/ Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching at the American Dance Festival; The National Culture Award from the New York State Federation of Foreign Language Teachers; Commendation from the White House Conference on Children and Youth.

He was also a co-founder of MandrakeSoft (which merged in Mandriva, now discontinued) with Jacques Le Marois and Frédéric Bastok.

Gaël Duval was responsible for communication in the Mandriva management team until he was laid off by the company in March 2006, in a round of cost-cutting. Duval suspected part of the reason for his dismissal was disagreement with management over the company&#x27;s future strategy, resulting in a lawsuit against the company.

, Duval is chairman and Chief Technology Officer at Ulteo. The company was bought by AZNetwork group in 2015.

In 2016, he co-founded NFactory.io, an incubator-accelerator of &quot;startups&quot;.

In November 2017, Gael Duval created the /e/ mobile operating system, which is a privacy-oriented fork of the Android-based LineageOS accompanied with a set of online services. In 2018, Duval founded the E Foundation, which maintains /e/, and ECORP SAS, a privately held corporation, which operates their online sales and services sites.

==Education==

Duval is a graduate of the University of Caen Normandy in France, where he studied networks and documentary applications.

<text>The Pneumodermatidae are a family of [[sea angel]]s, or small floating predatory sea snails or sea slugs. They are pelagic marine heterobranch opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the clade Gymnosomata.

These small pelagic snails lack shells (except in their early embryonic stage). They are carnivores, equipped with swimming parapoda (fleshy, wing-like outgrowths), strong jaws, and grasping tentacles, often with suckers resembling those of cephalopods.

<text>The Thanos Quest is a two-issue comic book limited series published in September and October 1990 by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Jim Starlin, and drawn by Ron Lim.

The storyline is a continuation of events involving resurrected Starlin-character Thanos, featured in the title &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;. The storyline leads directly into three consecutive limited series, &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;The Infinity War&quot;, and &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Recently resurrected by Death in order to wipe out half of the population of the universe, the Titan Thanos discovers the true nature of the six Infinity Gems after gazing into Death&#x27;s Infinity Well. Convincing Death that possession of the gems will aid him tremendously in his quest, he gains her permission to seek them out from the cosmic entities that currently possess them.

In Part One of &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot;, Thanos first travels to the Nexus of Reality where the &quot;concept being&quot; known as the In-Betweener is being imprisoned by Lord Chaos and Master Order; after freeing him from the sphere in which he is being incarcerated, Thanos forcibly takes the Soul Gem from the In-Betweener, whose powers are useless at the heart of the realm of Chaos and Order.

Thanos next seeks out the Champion of the Universe on a planet called Tamarata, where he has been testing his combat prowess against the planet&#x27;s numerous armies. Challenging him to single combat, Thanos tricks the Champion into destroying the planet and stranding himself in space. He then offers the Champion transportation to the nearest planet in exchange for the Champion&#x27;s Power Gem, to which the Champion agrees, believing that the gem has never functioned, but not realizing that he has tapped into its power reserves subconsciously. Thanos upholds his part of the bargain, but jettisons the Champion into the unnamed planet&#x27;s atmosphere, leaving him to plummet to the planet&#x27;s surface. His reasoning is that he had never promised the Champion a &quot;soft landing&quot;.

Thanos&#x27;s next target is the Gardener, who has been in possession of the Time Gem and has used its powers to create a garden of unparalleled beauty. After a short and seemingly peaceful discussion, the Gardener attempts to use the power of his gem to strangle Thanos in various items of vegetation; using the Power Gem, Thanos breaks free and turns the Gardener&#x27;s creations against him before taking the gem.

In Part Two, Thanos contacts the Collector, with whom he has apparently had an amicable past and who has been monitoring his activities since Thanos&#x27;s encounter with the Champion. Thanos informs the Collector that he will soon be coming into possession of a treasure so rare that the Collector will gladly part with his gem in trade for it.

Thanos then seeks out the Runner, who has been using the Space Gem in order to make himself the fastest being in existence. After the Runner destroys Thanos&#x27;s craft, Thanos reveals to him that he has discovered the true nature of the Infinity Gems; they are, in fact, the physical remnants of a godlike being that existed before the creation of our universe, who committed a form of cosmic suicide out of loneliness. He then uses the Time gem taken from the Gardener to turn the Runner first into an extremely old and decrepit man, and then into an infant. With the infant Runner in hand, he teleports back to the Collector&#x27;s ship and proceeds to trade the Runner for the Collector&#x27;s gem, the Reality Gem, which Thanos demonstrates to the astonished Collector has the ability to control reality. The Collector begs Thanos to leave, which he does... but only after allowing the Runner to revert to his normal age and form to take out his anger on the Collector.

Thanos&#x27;s final target is the Grandmaster, a consummate games-man. With the final gem, the Mind Gem, imprisoned in a random teleportation device that will only deactivate with his death, he informs Thanos that he cannot have the gem until he bests him in a game of his choosing. The two then compete in a virtual reality combat game, which Thanos seems to win until it is shown that the Grandmaster had sabotaged Thanos&#x27;s weaponry. However, Thanos then reveals that the body with which the Grandmaster had been competing was merely a robotic clone of Thanos; its destruction being inconsequential, the real Thanos proceeds to destroy the gaming equipment, killing the Grandmaster and freeing the Mind Gem.

Thanos returns to Death&#x27;s sanctum with the six Infinity Gems in his possession, boasting of his achievement and his new-found status as Death&#x27;s equal. Death congratulates his accomplishment, though still speaks to him through her various minions. When Thanos demands that Death address him personally as her mate, she points out to him, again through her minions, with his newly achieved status of omnipotence, Thanos is not her equal, but her superior, and that it would therefore not be fitting for her to address him directly. Thanos destroys the minion in a fit of anger and stalks from Death&#x27;s throne room, trying to comprehend his miscalculation, and finally wondering, while shedding a tear, how becoming a god could prove such a hollow victory.

==Collected editions==
The series has been reprinted a number of times, first in a 2000 one-shot and then as part of the &quot;Rebirth of Thanos&quot; trade paperback which brought together all the pre-&quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot; issues dealing with Thanos&#x27;s return:

*&quot;Silver Surfer: Rebirth Of Thanos&quot; (collects &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #34-38, &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot; mini-series, and &quot;The Final Flower!&quot; from &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; #6, 224 pages, April 2006, )

==In other media==
Some elements of the comic were later loosely adapted in &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="705635" wikidata="Q352923" url="?curid=705635" title="Air mass (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, air mass or airmass is a measure of the amount of air along the line of sight when observing a star or other celestial source from below Earth&#x27;s atmosphere . It is formulated as the integral of air density along the light ray.

As it penetrates the atmosphere, light is attenuated by scattering and absorption; the thicker atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation. Consequently, celestial bodies when nearer the horizon appear less bright than when nearer the zenith. This attenuation, known as atmospheric extinction, is described quantitatively by the Beer–Lambert law.

&quot;Air mass&quot; normally indicates &quot;relative air mass&quot;, the ratio of absolute air masses (as defined above) at oblique incidence relative to that at zenith. So, by definition, the relative air mass at the zenith is 1. Air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases, reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon. Air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level; however, most closed-form expressions for air mass do not include the effects of the observer&#x27;s elevation, so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means.

Tables of air mass have been published by numerous authors, including , , and .

== Definition ==
The &quot;absolute air mass&quot; is defined as:
formula_1
where formula_2 is volumetric density of air. Thus formula_3 is a type of oblique column density.

In the vertical direction, the &quot;absolute air mass at zenith&quot; is:
formula_4

So formula_5 is a type of vertical column density.

Finally, the &quot;relative air mass&quot; is:
formula_6

Assuming air density to be uniform allows removing it from the integrals. The absolute air mass then simplifies to a product:
formula_7
where formula_8 is the average density and the arc length formula_9 of the oblique and zenith light paths are:
formula_10

In the corresponding simplified relative air mass, the average density cancels out in the fraction, leading to the ratio of path lengths:
formula_11

Further simplifications are often made, assuming straight-line propagation (neglecting ray bending), as discussed below.

== Calculation ==
=== Background ===

The angle of a celestial body with the zenith is the &quot;zenith angle&quot; (in astronomy, commonly referred to as the &quot;zenith distance&quot;). A body&#x27;s angular position can also be given in terms of &quot;altitude&quot;, the angle above the geometric horizon; the altitude formula_12 and the zenith angle formula_13 are thus related by
formula_14

Atmospheric refraction causes light entering the atmosphere to follow an approximately circular path that is slightly longer than the geometric path. Air mass must take into account the longer path . Additionally, refraction causes a celestial body to appear higher above the horizon than it actually is; at the horizon, the difference between the true zenith angle and the apparent zenith angle is approximately 34 minutes of arc. Most air mass formulas are based on the apparent zenith angle, but some are based on the true zenith angle, so it is important to ensure that the correct value is used, especially near the horizon.

=== Plane-parallel atmosphere ===
When the zenith angle is small to moderate, a good approximation is given by assuming a homogeneous plane-parallel atmosphere (i.e., one in which density is constant and Earth&#x27;s curvature is ignored). The air mass formula_15 then is simply the secant of the zenith angle formula_13:
formula_17

At a zenith angle of 60°, the air mass is approximately 2. However, because the Earth is not flat, this formula is only usable for zenith angles up to about 60° to 75°, depending on accuracy requirements. At greater zenith angles, the accuracy degrades rapidly, with formula_18 becoming infinite at the horizon; the horizon air mass in the more realistic spherical atmosphere is usually less than 40.

=== Interpolative formulas ===
Many formulas have been developed to fit tabular values of air mass; one by included a simple corrective term:
formula_19
where formula_20 is the true zenith angle. This gives usable results up to approximately 80°, but the accuracy degrades rapidly at greater zenith angles. The calculated air mass reaches a maximum of 11.13 at 86.6°, becomes zero at 88°, and approaches negative infinity at the horizon. The plot of this formula on the accompanying graph includes a correction for atmospheric refraction so that the calculated air mass is for apparent rather than true zenith angle.

 introduced a polynomial in formula_21:
formula_22
which gives usable results for zenith angles of up to perhaps 85°. As with the previous formula, the calculated air mass reaches a maximum, and then approaches negative infinity at the horizon.

 suggested
formula_23
which gives reasonable results for high zenith angles, with a horizon air mass of 40.

 developed

formula_24
which gives reasonable results for zenith angles of up to 90°, with an air mass of approximately 38 at the horizon. Here the second formula_13 term is in &quot;degrees&quot;.

 developed
formula_26
in terms of the true zenith angle formula_20, for which he claimed a maximum error (at the horizon) of 0.0037 air mass.

 developed
formula_28
where formula_12 is apparent altitude formula_30 in degrees. Pickering claimed his equation to have a tenth the error of near the horizon.

=== Atmospheric models ===
Interpolative formulas attempt to provide a good fit to tabular values of air mass using minimal computational overhead. The tabular values, however, must be determined from measurements or atmospheric models that derive from geometrical and physical considerations of Earth and its atmosphere.

==== Nonrefracting spherical atmosphere ====
If atmospheric refraction is ignored, it can be shown from simple geometrical considerations (Schoenberg 1929, 173) that the path formula_9 of a light ray at zenith angle
formula_13 through a radially symmetrical atmosphere of height formula_33 above the Earth is given by
formula_34
or alternatively,
formula_35
where formula_36 is the radius of the Earth.

The relative air mass is then:
formula_37

==== Homogeneous atmosphere ====
If the atmosphere is homogeneous (i.e., density is constant), the atmospheric height formula_33 follows from hydrostatic considerations as:
formula_39
where formula_40 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_41 is the sea-level temperature, formula_42 is the molecular mass of air, and formula_43 is the acceleration due to gravity. Although this is the same as the pressure scale height of an isothermal atmosphere, the implication is slightly different. In an isothermal atmosphere, 37% (1/e) of the atmosphere is above the pressure scale height; in a homogeneous atmosphere, there is no atmosphere above the atmospheric height.

Taking formula_44, formula_45, and formula_46 gives formula_47. Using Earth&#x27;s mean radius of 6371 km, the sea-level air mass at the horizon is
formula_48

The homogeneous spherical model slightly underestimates the rate of increase in air mass near the horizon; a reasonable overall fit to values determined from more rigorous models can be had by setting the air mass to match a value at a zenith angle less than 90°. The air mass equation can be rearranged to give
formula_49
matching Bemporad&#x27;s value of 19.787 at formula_13 = 88°
gives formula_51 ≈ 631.01 and
formula_52 ≈ 35.54. With the same value for formula_53 as above, formula_54 ≈ 10,096 m.

While a homogeneous atmosphere is not a physically realistic model, the approximation is reasonable as long as the scale height of the atmosphere is small compared to the radius of the planet. The model is usable (i.e., it does not diverge or go to zero) at all zenith angles, including those greater than 90° (see &quot;&quot;). The model requires comparatively little computational overhead, and if high accuracy is not required, it gives reasonable results.
However, for zenith angles less than 90°, a better fit to accepted values of air mass can be had with several
of the interpolative formulas.

==== Variable-density atmosphere ====
In a real atmosphere, density is not constant (it decreases with elevation above mean sea level. The absolute air mass for the geometrical light path discussed above, becomes, for a sea-level observer,
formula_55

==== Isothermal atmosphere ====
Several basic models for density variation with elevation are commonly used. The simplest, an isothermal atmosphere, gives
formula_56
where formula_57 is the sea-level density and formula_58 is the density scale height. When the limits of integration are zero and infinity, the result is known as Chapman function. An approximate result is obtained if some high-order terms are dropped, yielding ,
formula_59

An approximate correction for refraction can be made by taking 
formula_60
where formula_36 is the physical radius of the Earth. At the horizon, the approximate equation becomes
formula_62

Using a scale height of 8435 m, Earth&#x27;s mean radius of 6371 km, and including the correction for refraction,
formula_63

==== Polytropic atmosphere ====
The assumption of constant temperature is simplistic; a more realistic model is the polytropic atmosphere, for which
formula_64
where formula_41 is the sea-level temperature and formula_66 is the temperature lapse rate. The density as a function of elevation is
formula_67
where formula_68 is the polytropic exponent (or polytropic index). The air mass integral for the polytropic model does not lend itself to a closed-form solution except at the zenith, so the integration usually is performed numerically.

==== Layered atmosphere ====
Earth&#x27;s atmosphere consists of multiple layers with different temperature and density characteristics; common atmospheric models include the International Standard Atmosphere and the US Standard Atmosphere. A good approximation for many purposes is a polytropic troposphere of 11 km height with a lapse rate of 6.5 K/km and an isothermal stratosphere of infinite height , which corresponds very closely to the first two layers of the International Standard Atmosphere. More layers can be used if greater accuracy is required.

==== Refracting radially symmetrical atmosphere ====
When atmospheric refraction is considered, ray tracing becomes necessary , and the absolute air mass integral becomes
formula_69
where formula_70 is the index of refraction of air at the observer&#x27;s elevation formula_71 above sea level, formula_72 is the index of refraction at elevation formula_73 above sea level, formula_74,
formula_75 is the distance from the center of the Earth to a point at elevation formula_73, and formula_77 is distance to the upper limit of the atmosphere at elevation formula_54. The index of refraction in terms of density is usually given to sufficient accuracy (Garfinkel 1967) by the Gladstone–Dale relation
formula_79

Rearrangement and substitution into the absolute air mass integral gives
formula_80

The quantity formula_81 is quite small; expanding the first term in parentheses, rearranging several times, and ignoring terms in formula_82 after each rearrangement, gives 
formula_83

==== Homogeneous spherical atmosphere with elevated observer ====


In the figure at right, an observer at O is at an elevation formula_84 above sea level in a uniform radially symmetrical atmosphere of height formula_54. The path length of a light ray at zenith angle formula_13 is formula_9; formula_53 is the radius of the Earth. Applying the law of cosines to triangle OAC,
formula_89
expanding the left- and right-hand sides, eliminating the common terms, and rearranging gives
formula_90

Solving the quadratic for the path length &quot;s&quot;, factoring, and rearranging,
formula_91

The negative sign of the radical gives a negative result, which is not physically meaningful. Using the positive sign, dividing by formula_54, and cancelling common terms and rearranging gives the relative air mass:
formula_93

With the substitutions formula_94 and formula_95, this can be given as
formula_96

In the limit of grazing incidence, the absolute airmass equals the distance to the horizon. Furthermore, if the observer is elevated, the horizon zenith angle can be greater than 90°.
=== Nonuniform distribution of attenuating species ===
Atmospheric models that derive from hydrostatic considerations assume an atmosphere of constant composition and a single mechanism of extinction, which isn&#x27;t quite correct. There are three main sources of attenuation : Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, Mie scattering by aerosols, and molecular absorption (primarily by ozone). The relative contribution of each source varies with elevation above sea level, and the concentrations of aerosols and ozone cannot be derived simply from hydrostatic considerations.

Rigorously, when the extinction coefficient depends on elevation, it must be determined as part of the air mass integral, as described by . A compromise approach often is possible, however. Methods for separately calculating the extinction from each species using closed-form expressions are described in and . The latter reference includes source code for a BASIC program to perform the calculations. Reasonably accurate calculation of extinction can sometimes be done by using one of the simple air mass formulas and separately determining extinction coefficients for each of the attenuating species (, ).

== Implications ==

=== Air mass and astronomy ===

In optical astronomy, the air mass provides an indication of the deterioration of the observed image, not only as regards direct effects of spectral absorption, scattering and reduced brightness, but also an aggregation of visual aberrations, e.g. resulting from atmospheric turbulence, collectively referred to as the quality of the &quot;seeing&quot;. On bigger telescopes, such as the WHT and VLT , the atmospheric dispersion can be so severe that it affects the pointing of the telescope to the target. In such cases an atmospheric dispersion compensator is used, which usually consists of two prisms.

The Greenwood frequency and Fried parameter, both relevant for adaptive optics, depend on the air mass above them (or more specifically, on the zenith angle).

In radio astronomy the air mass (which influences the optical path length) is not relevant. The lower layers of the atmosphere, modeled by the air mass, do not significantly impede radio waves, which are of much lower frequency than optical waves. Instead, some radio waves are affected by the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. Newer aperture synthesis radio telescopes are especially affected by this as they “see” a much larger portion of the sky and thus the ionosphere. In fact, LOFAR needs to explicitly calibrate for these distorting effects (; ), but on the other hand can also study the ionosphere by instead measuring these distortions .

=== Air mass and solar energy ===

In some fields, such as solar energy and photovoltaics, air mass is indicated by the acronym AM; additionally, the value of the air mass is often given by appending its value to AM, so that AM1 indicates an air mass of 1, AM2 indicates an air mass of 2, and so on. The region above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where there is no atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, is considered to have &quot;air mass zero&quot; (AM0).

Atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation is not the same for all wavelengths; consequently, passage through the atmosphere not only reduces intensity but also alters the spectral irradiance. Photovoltaic modules are commonly rated using spectral irradiance for an air mass of 1.5 (AM1.5); tables of these standard spectra are given in ASTM G 173-03. The extraterrestrial spectral irradiance (i.e., that for AM0) is given in ASTM E 490-00a.

For many solar energy applications when high accuracy near the horizon is not required, air mass is commonly determined using the simple secant formula described in &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="705642" wikidata="Q1026685" url="?curid=705642" title="Wellington, Somerset">
<text>Wellington is a market town in Somerset, England. It is situated south west of Taunton, near the border with Devon, which runs along the Blackdown Hills to the south of the town. The town had a population of 16,669, which includes the residents of the parish of Wellington Without, and the villages of Tone and Tonedale.

Known as &quot;Weolingtun&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon period, its name had changed to &quot;Walintone&quot; by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter. Major rebuilding took place following a fire in the town in 1731, after which it became a centre for cloth-making. It is possible that the fire referred to here was actually in Tiverton, Devon which has details of a major fire in the same year. Further information on a major fire in Wellington at this time cannot be found.

In 1809, the Crown referenced Wellington when creating a viscountcy for the eventual Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, after his victory at the Battle of Talavera in the Peninsular War. When the title&#x27;s name was being considered, Arthur&#x27;s brother, Richard Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, found an available manor in the parish of Wellington, a name close to the family name. Richard oversaw the manor&#x27;s purchase while Arthur commanded the army in Spain against the French. The Wellington Monument south of Wellington commemorates Arthur.

The Grand Western Canal reached the town in 1835 and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1843. The town&#x27;s own railway station survived until 1964. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales. In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily.

Local industries, which now include an aerosol factory and the Relyon bed manufacturers, are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore street. Wellington is home to the independent Wellington School, and state-funded Court Fields School. It is also home to a range of cultural, sporting and religious sites including the 15th century Church of St John the Baptist.

The capital city of New Zealand is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, being recognised as having some influence in the company that founded the New Zealand town. The New Zealand capital therefore takes its name ultimately from the English town of Wellington in Somerset.

==History==

In a grant of between 899 and 909 Edward the Elder gave the land then known as &quot;Weolingtun&quot;, which means &quot;wealthy estate&quot;, along with West Buckland and Bishops Lydeard to Bishop Asser. This was in exchange for the monastery of Plympton in Devon. An alternative explanation for the origin of the name is &quot;the settlement in the temple clearing&quot;. By the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, the name had changed to &quot;Walintone&quot; and the estate was owned by Gisa (Bishop of Wells). The parish of Wellington was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred,

A site at Longforth Farm near Tonedale has been identified as having Bronze Age occupation and, during excavations prior to the building of new homes, found to have been occupied by a 12th-14th century building with decorated floor tiles covering .

A royal charter of 1215 gave Wellington its status as a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out with the church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution. By the end of the 16th century it had come under the protection of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War.

Major rebuilding took place in the town following a fire in 1731. After this the town&#x27;s importance grew as it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon, its importance as trade centre enhanced by fires in Taunton and Tiverton. By the 1831 census, 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington.

Arthur Wellesley took the title of his Marquessate in 1809 from this town of Wellington. Nearby Wellington Hill boasts a large, spotlit obelisk to his honour. The Wellington Monument is a floodlit high triangular tower designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. It was erected to celebrate the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Waterloo. The foundation stone was laid in 1817 on land belonging to the Duke but, owing to funding problems, the monument was not completed until 1854. It is now owned by the National Trust who announced plans to reclad the monument at a cost of £4 million in 2009. Wellington Town Hall, originally built as a market hall, was completed in 1833.

In the 18th century turnpikes arrived in the area and then in the 19th communications improved with the Grand Western Canal reaching the town in 1835. Wellington station was opened when the Bristol and Exeter Railway reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands on the east side of the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.

In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway, which opened in sections in the 1960s and 1970s, enabled car journeys to be made more easily.

===Fox Fowler &amp; Co. Bank===

Thomas Fox started the Fox, Fowler and Company bank in Wellington which rapidly expanded and ran successfully, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. It was the last private bank in England to issue its own notes and they were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation. The British Museum have another example on display. The bank established its Head Office at the old family house in Fore Street, Wellington (today the Lloyds Bank branch) – they opened branches at Taunton, Bridgwater, Weston-super-Mare, Torrington, Bideford, Barnstaple, Ilfracombe and South Molton.

The original £5 note is on display at Tone Dale House – one of the last nine and possible the only one left uncancelled.

==Governance==

Wellington has two tiers of local government: the parish and unitary authority level. The present system dates from 1 April 2023 when Somerset Council came into existence and the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which had been established in 2019, was abolished.

The lower tier is Wellington Town Council, formed as a successor parish to Wellington Urban District Council in 1974. The town council has 15 councillors, and is headed by a town mayor. For elections of town councillors, the town is divided into four wards: Wellington East (returning 4 councillors), Wellington North (4), Rockwell Green (3) and Wellington West (4). The political composition of the council in November 2009 was Liberal Democrats 7, Conservative Party 5 and Labour Party 3. The town council provides purely local services. An area to the south of the town falls within the civil parish of Wellington Without.

The upper tier is Somerset Council. Based in Taunton, the council has 110 councillors, two elected for each of its 55 electoral divisions. Most of the town comprises the Wellington electoral division and, since 2022, is represented by one Labour and one Conservative councillor. Somerset Council is responsible for running all local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Wellington forms part of the Taunton and Wellington constituency. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Geography==

The town has many dependent villages including West Buckland, Langford Budville, Nynehead, Sampford Arundel and Sampford Moor. The formerly independent village of Rockwell Green, to the west of the town, has been incorporated into the town however there is still a green wedge of land in between them. Wellington Park was a gift from the Quaker Fox family to the town in 1903 as a memorial to the coronation of King Edward VII. The gardens were laid out by F.W. Meyer, who included a rock garden which used 80 tons of limestone from Westleigh quarry near Burlescombe. It is Grade II listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. It was restored at a cost of £412,827 which included a grant of £296,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund Public Parks Initiative.

There are Local Nature Reserves at Wellington Basins on the western fringe of the town. It includes a small pond and boardwalk with a variety of wildlife habitats. The grassland, hedges and woodland are home to a varied flora and fauna including birds such as the grey wagtail, white-throated dipper and reed bunting. Five separate bat species have been recorded at the site. Swains Pond in the south of Wellington is another Local Nature Reserve, which used to be the site of orchards. It now includes a pond which provides a home for amphibians including the great crested newt, palmate newt and toads.

===Climate===
Wellington has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).
Along with the rest of South West England, Wellington has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==
The town has a population of 14,696. Large growth occurred during the 1970s when housing developments were built on the south side of the town. These were largely prompted by Wellington&#x27;s proximity to Junction 26 of the M5 motorway.

==Economy==

Wellington&#x27;s main industry was wool-making and in November 2009, Deborah Meaden, best known from &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; a BBC television programme, invested in the Fox Brothers&#x27; Mill which produces wool cloth for Savile Row, designers and clients around the world. The Fox family established the mill in 1772. The Tonedale mill complex includes two listed buildings, some of which were still being used until 2000. The Prince&#x27;s Regeneration Trust have been supporting the Tone Mill Regeneration Partnership in attempting to preserve and regenerate the area with a mixed development for commercial and residential use. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage.

The last Fox family house in Wellington Tone Dale House is still owned by Ben and Victoria Fox, Ben is the great-great-great-great-grandson of Thomas Fox. Tone Dale House (since 1996) is also now run as an events and hire venue, for house parties, anniversaries, weddings and corporate events.
Local industries are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore Street. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales.

The town is still largely dependent on industry, along with the neighbouring towns Taunton and Bridgwater with manufacturing industries identified within the county economic strategy as key centres for further economic development, due to good transport links. Swallowfield plc benefited from the growth of own-brand products during the 1970s and now produces aerosol, cosmetic and toiletry products. It was founded in 1876 as Walter Gregory &amp; Co Ltd who manufactured animal husbandry products. The company diversified and in 1950 produced the first commercial aerosols in the UK which were basically farm products, air fresheners and insecticides. Bed manufacturers Relyon employ some 400 people. The company started in 1858 as a wool merchant, Price Brothers and Co., but the business soon moved into manufacturing beds and in 1935 changed its name to Relyon Ltd. In 2001 it was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd., a quoted South African group.

==Transport==

The town was served by Wellington railway station on the Bristol and Exeter Railway from 1 May 1843 until 5 October 1964. It was here that extra locomotives were attached to heavy trains to help them up the incline to Whiteball Tunnel on their way south. The railway from Penzance to London, and also to Bristol and the North, continue to pass through the town, but no trains stop. The nearest railway stations are Taunton and Tiverton Parkway. A campaign was started to reopen the railway station in 2009. The government approved a new train station being opened in the town in October 2023, but withdrew the funding for this in July 2024.

The town is close to junction 26 of the M5 motorway, which spent a year in the 1970s as a temporary terminal junction, whilst the motorway between junctions 26 and 27 was finished. The A38 is still a very important link to Taunton. Wellington is served twice daily by Berrys Coaches &#x27;Superfast&#x27; service to and from London.

==Education==
Wellington is home to a public school, Wellington School. It was founded in 1837 as an all-boys school. A solitary day girl was allowed to join the Sixth Form in 1972 and the following year Wellington became co-educational. The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over. In December 2007, the school commissioned its new multi-purpose examination hall and English Department adjacent to its Sports Centre. Notable alumni of Wellington School include actor David Suchet, chef Keith Floyd and peer Lord Archer.

The main secondary school in the town is Court Fields School. The 11–16 school includes a sports complex, completed in early 2008.
==Religious sites==
Despite its small size, Wellington has historically been notable for its profusion of churches of many different denominations, including a Quaker meeting house, the Grade I listed, 15th century Church of St John the Baptist, which includes a monument to John Popham, and the Roman Catholic Church of St John Fisher which was built in 1606 as Popham&#x27;s Almshouses and converted into a Roman Catholic church 1936. There was a Presbyterian Independent Church.

==Culture==

Wellington has its own amateur dramatic group, formed in the 1960s, called Wellington Arts Association, which holds productions both at Wellington Arts Centre and at the Wellesley Theatre. It includes the Genesis Youth Theatre Group, Operatic Society, Pantomime Group, Civic Players, Arcadians and the Spectrum Arts And Crafts. The Wellesley Cinema was built in 1937, in the Art Deco style. The auditorium seats 400 people on two levels and is run as an independent cinema.

Wellington and District Camera Club meets in the New Science Block, Wellington School. The club is affiliated to the Western Counties Photographic Federation (W.C.P.F.) and also to Wellington Arts Association (W.A.A.).

The town has its own weekly newspaper, the &quot;Wellington Weekly News&quot;, which was first published in 1860. There is also a community website providing news and views about the town, Around Wellington.

The town is home to Wellington Silver Band, a four section brass band. The band can trace its origins to 1887, when it was formed from the volunteer band of the 2nd Battalion, Prince Albert&#x27;s Somersetshire Light Infantry.

Wellington is twinned to the town of Immenstadt in Germany, the town of Lillebonne in France and Torres Vedras in Portugal.

==Sport==
Wellington Cricket Club have a ground off Courtland Road, and have two teams in the Somerset Cricket League. Wellington A.F.C. football Club was formed in 1892 and now play in the Western Football League.

Wellington Bowmen is an archery club formed in 2001. It uses facilities at the rugby club and at Court Fields School. The Rugby club itself was founded in 1874. The first team plays in the Western Counties West League.

<text>UZEB is a Canadian jazz fusion band from Montreal, Quebec who were active from 1976 to 1992, and reunited in November 2016. The members are Alain Caron (bass guitar), Michel Cusson (guitar), and Paul Brochu (drums). The band won a number of Canadian awards during the 1980s. By 1989, international sales of UZEB&#x27;s first eight recordings had exceeded 200,000 units, which the &quot;Encyclopedia of Music in Canada&quot; calls &quot;an unprecedented figure for a Canadian jazz group&quot;.

==History==
UZEB was formed in 1976 in Drummondville, Quebec, when guitarist Michel Cusson and bassist Alain Caron started a jazz duo. The band originally named itself Eusèbe Jazz, their first concert (in Acton Vale, QC) being on the name day of St Eusèbe. This name was later shortened to UZEB. The band soon moved to Montreal. Drummer Paul Brochu joined Cusson and Caron in 1978. Until 1987, the band included a keyboardist: first Jean St-Jacques, followed by Stephan Montanaro (featured on the album &quot;Live in Bracknell&quot;), Sylvain Coutu, and then Michel Cyr. In the 1980s, UZEB had what was then a very technologically advanced MIDI system for its synthesizers.

After 1987, UZEB became a trio consisting of Cusson, Caron, and Brochu. UZEB won Quebec Félix awards as group of the year in 1984 and 1989 (in competition with Quebec pop and rock bands). As well, the band won awards for jazz album of the year in 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987. UZEB did Quebec-wide and several Canadian tours. In 1991 UZEB received the Oscar Peterson Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented at the 1991 Montreal International Jazz Festival.

UZEB played its first European concert in 1981 at the Bracknell (England) Jazz Festival. In 1983, UZEB appeared at the Festival de Jazz de Paris and recorded at the Olympia in Paris. UZEB also played in other European countries and in Southeast Asia (in 1990). However, UZEB rarely played concerts in the US. UZEB&#x27;s most popular songs include &quot;Junk Funk&quot;, &quot;Smiles and Chuckles&quot;, &quot;Mile &#x27;O&#x27;&quot;, &quot;60 rue des Lombards&quot;, &quot;Spider&quot;, and &quot;Uzeb Club&quot;.

In 2017, the band reformed for a series of five concerts in Europe and fourteen in Quebec.

<text>Wellington School is a co-educational fee-charging boarding and day school in the English public school tradition for pupils aged 3–18 located in Wellington, Somerset, England. Wellington School was founded in 1837.

Wellington School is a registered charity and has around 800 pupils currently in attendance. Around 150 of those pupils are boarders. The school is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. Wellington School is based on a 35-acre campus in Wellington, Somerset.

Wellington School operates its own feeder preparatory school, Wellington Prep School which shares the main campus. Wellington Prep School students often use the sporting pitches and science labs of Wellington School.

==History==

Wellington School is situated to the south of the centre of the small town of Wellington. It was founded originally as Wellington Academy in 1837 as an all-boys school by Benjamin Frost (Headmaster 1837–1848). It was later purchased and run by Frost&#x27;s wife and William Corner (Headmaster 1848–1879). In 1879 under new headmaster Francis Raban renamed the school West Somerset County School, although only 34 years later the school was again renamed but this time as Wellington School, the name it retains today.

The school was originally founded as a private boys&#x27; school, but in the early 1970s girls were first accepted into the Sixth Form. From 1979 girls were accepted from the age of 10.

The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over. This was renamed &quot;Wellington Prep School&quot; in 2015.

In 2003 the Princess Royal opened the Princess Royal Sports Complex, a £2.65 million indoor sports facility. The Princess Royal Sports Complex was offered to competitors in the 2012 London Olympics for training.

The Good Schools Guide described Wellington School as &quot;Friendly, purposeful and busy, it is a solid, well-managed school, neat but not glossy, giving its pupils a sound education and masses of high points in developmental experience.&quot; The Guide also described Wellington School as &quot;Down to earth. Punches above its weight. No sense of entitlement. Good value for money. Not our words, those of a parent. Says it for us, too&quot;.

==Arms==

==Sports==

The school has rugby pitches, cricket squares, football pitches, an all-weather pitch, all-weather training areas, tennis courts, squash courts, climbing wall and an indoor swimming pool.

Football was reintroduced in the 2003 school year.

Many students have gone on to represent the school in county and England hockey, national athletics, county and England fencing and county rugby.

==Music==

The school&#x27;s music department, dedicated to the ex-headmaster George Corner, includes a recording studio, iMac suite, and percussion studio as well as many practice rooms and two classrooms. All 15 pianos in the department are by Steinway &amp; Sons, accrediting the school as an &#x27;All Steinway School&#x27;, the first of its kind in England.

Regular concerts are held throughout the school year, performance spaces include the department&#x27;s &#x27;Small Hall&#x27;, the school&#x27;s main hall (Great Hall) and the school chapel which is fitted with an electronic organ alongside a Steinway baby grand.

==Chapel==

Built between 1928 and 1931 by C. H. Biddulph-Pinchard, the Grade II listed red brick building is dressed with stone and has a flat roof which is concealed behind a parapet. It is a rectangular single-cell chapel with a carved stone altar. The Chapel went through specialist restoration work in 2013 which involved the repainting of the ceiling among other maintenance tasks. This restoration was funded partly by the school&#x27;s Old Wellingtonians&#x27; Association

The east end of the building holds choir stalls and an organ loft over the entrance vestibule. The interior is highly decorated with finely carved wooden wall panels and elaborately decorated canopies made of molded plaster.

The Church of England Chapel has a full-time Chaplain who prepares pupils for Confirmation annually. Though some assemblies and concerts are also held in the building, there are Sunday services throughout term time for boarders and members of the public; these involve regular performances by the school&#x27;s chapel choir. There are also shorter services most days during the week with pupils attending on a house rota basis.

The Chapel was built as a memorial to those who fell during the first world war. George Corner, the then headmaster, wrote to the Old Boys and asked for their support in the project. The 37 members of the Wellington School Community who gave their lives are listed on the walls of the Chapel. Each year a pupil from each boarding house remembers one former pupil specifically, researching how and where they died and a basket of flowers is laid in their memory.

Confirmation and all the other occasional offices of the church are open to all members of the school community on request.

==Combined Cadet Force==
The school has a marching band and active Combined Cadet Force, founded in 1901. The Combined Cadet Force is open to senior school pupils, and has upwards of 170 cadets across the Royal Navy, Army and Air Force sections.

The cadets learn military based skills such as drill, weapons handling, map and compass, battlecraft, climbing, abseiling and leadership development. There are various CCF camps, military training weekends and cadet competitions each year, during which the cadets go on field manoeuvres in order to apply the skills they have learned in a practical situation.

Wellington School is unique in having three field exercises a year, each lasting three days and two nights. A full-time member of staff at Wellington School runs the CCF and acts as the senior officer. He is assisted by an experienced warrant officer. The cadets are required to present themselves for inspection by the masters in charge of each section on a weekly basis.

<doc id="705659" wikidata="Q354301" url="?curid=705659" title="Lee Evans (sprinter)">
<text>Lee Edward Evans (February 25, 1947 – May 19, 2021) was an American sprinter. He won two gold medals in the 1968 Summer Olympics, setting world records in the 400 meters and the 4 × 400 meters relay, both of which stood for 20 and 24 years respectively. Evans co-founded the Olympic Project for Human Rights and was part of the athlete&#x27;s boycott and the Black Power movement.

==Early life and education==
Lee Edward Evans was born on February 25, 1947, in Madera, California, to Dayton and Pearlie Mae Evans. At the age of four, his family moved to Fresno. He attended Madison Elementary School and in his last year there,he trained for his first race by racing his friends at school. Evans went on to Central Union High School where he was classified in the C class for the 660 yard dash due to his height, weight, and age. Due to his mother contracting Valley fever, the Evans family moved to San Jose, California, during Lee&#x27;s sophomore year. While running for Overfelt High School, Evans was undefeated, improving his 440-yard time from 48.2 in 1964 to 46.9 in 1965.

Evans was a Fulbright scholar in sociology and attended San Jose State, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Bud Winter. In 1966 as a freshman, he won his first AAU championship in 440 yd (402.34 m). He won the AAU title four years in a row (1966–1969) and again in 1972 and he added the NCAA 400 m title in 1968. His only defeat during that streak came at the hands of San Jose State teammate Tommie Smith. The two were so competitive, Winter could not let them practice together.

Evans achieved his first world record in 1966, as a member of the USA national team which broke the 4 × 400 m relay record at Los Angeles, the first team to better 3 minutes (2:59.6) in the event. The next year he helped break the 4 x 220 yd (201.17 m) relay world record at Fresno in a time of 1:22.1. In 1967, Evans won the 400 metres at the Pan American Games, in an automatic time of 44.95, which (in the era of hand times) was the first bona fide automatic time to break 45 seconds.

== Olympics ==
Evans was an influential leader in regards to the Black Power movement. The Olympic Project for Human Rights began with black students protesting in order to have equal housing opportunities and was made into the black power movement after a Tommie Smith interview. Tommie Smith and John Carlos were the faces of the movement, but Smith and Evans were the driving forces behind the movement. Carlos was said to have not even come to any of the meetings of the group, but when it came time to be in the spotlight he took his chance and claimed his spot in the history books.

The black athletes of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics chose not to protest the Olympics as a whole, instead they chose to protest by wearing an article of black clothing during every event in which they participated. Evans wanted the world to understand the way he felt about the Mexico City Olympic Games but did not want to take away from the winners and the sports themselves. In regards to the South African Olympic Ban, Vince Matthews asked Evans what would happen after the verdict because of his position as OPHR organizer. Evans replied that it was unclear as to what the International Olympic Committee would decide, but whatever the decision was the United States Olympic Team would stick together. Evans received death threats prior to and during the Olympics and claimed that had he not had these threats on his mind he probably could have run faster than he did, even though he broke a world record.

Evans won the 1968 Olympic trials at Echo Summit, California, with a world record 44.06 and demolished it in the Olympic final, winning in 43.86 seconds aged 21 years and 8 months, from which he still stands as the 19th best performer in history. Evans won a second gold as the anchorman on the 4 × 400 m relay team, setting another world record of 2:56.16. Both times stood as a world record for almost twenty years (the relay, for almost 24 years). While accepting the relay Gold medal Evans and fellow African-American medalists Larry James and Ron Freeman received their medals wearing black berets in imitation of the Black Panther Party. After winning the AAU 400 m titles in 1969 and 1972, Evans finished only fourth in the 1972 Olympic trials, but was named a member of the 4 × 400 m relay team once more. However, when the time came the United States could not field a team because Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett were suspended by the IOC for a demonstration at a medal ceremony similar to the one staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the previous Olympics.

== Post-Olympics ==
Evans became a professional after the 1972 season joining the International Track Association (ITA) tour. He had some success on the ITA tour notably setting a 600 m indoors world best at the first meet in Idaho State University&#x27;s Minidome. The ITA folded in 1976 and Evans was reinstated as an amateur in 1980 and ran a 46.5 in one of his few appearances that year, at the age of thirty-three.

Evans went on to head the national athletics programs in six different African nations before accepting a position as head cross country/track &amp; field coach at the University of South Alabama.
Evans&#x27; college and amateur careers as well as his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement are chronicled in Frank Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Last Protest: Lee Evans in Mexico City&quot;. Evans was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1983.

1983 and 1998 Evans competed in Masters Track and Field Competitions.

In 2011, Evans was diagnosed with &quot;a large tumor in the pituitary gland area of his brain&quot; and underwent surgery. He was banned from coaching for four years in 2014 when a 16-year-old Nigerian girl he was coaching tested positive for a banned steroid after he advised her to take supplements.

In May 2021, Evans had a stroke and was hospitalized in Lagos, Nigeria. He died on May 19, 2021, at the age of 74.

<doc id="705669" wikidata="Q6896091" url="?curid=705669" title="Molera">
<text>A molera (also known as a fontanel) is a &quot;soft spot&quot; on the top of a Chihuahua&#x27;s skull; it is the equivalent to the bregmatic or anterior fontanelle in human babies, but unlike most mammals Chihuahua&#x27;s fontanelle persist into maturity. Historically it has been very common amongst Chihuahuas and was regarded as a mark of purity for this miniature dog breed. It is still mentioned in many Chihuahua breed standards, however, it is considered a fault in European countries because of concern that this might reflect underlying malformations such as hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly, Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia. Fontanelles are fibrous, membrane-covered gaps that lie between the skull bones and at the intersection of the cranial sutures. The cranial sutures are the junctions between cranial (or skull) bones. The fontanelles serve as the major sites of bone expansion during post-natal skull growth which accommodates the enlarging brain. The Chihuahua likely has a molera because of neuroparenchymal disproportion i.e. a proportionally big brain for the skull. This is likely because there is premature closure of the skull base cranial sutures (brachycephaly due to craniosynostosis). To accommodate the developing brain there is increased growth of the skull bone in a parallel plane giving the dog a characterised domed or &quot;apple-headed&quot; appearance. 

A Finnish study from (University of Helsinki with University of Surrey) found that increased number and size of persistent fontanelles in Chihuahuas were associated with small body size, syringomyelia (fluid filled cavities in the spinal cord), ventriculomegaly (i.e. enlargement of the lateral ventricles), and craniocervical junction abnormalities. The challenges the belief that a molera is clinically irrelevant finding not associated with other structural abnormalities.
Explanation of often misquoted veterinary sources (Greene and Braund / Rivers and Walker)
Many internet sources state incorrectly that there was a study on molera performed by which (paraphrasing) &quot;did not find an connection between moleras and hydrocephalus in toy breeds such as the Chihuahua&quot;. There was no such study. This was an unreferenced statement, although it reflected clinical experience, and was made over 30 years ago in the 3rd edition of Ettinger&#x27;s Veterinary Internal Medicine. This statement was not kept in subsequent editions and this tome is now being revised for the 9th edition. It is also incorrectly stated on multiple websites that there was &quot;a separate study conducted by Dr. Walker and Dr. Rivers at the University of Minnesota that found no correlation between the presence or size of a molera and hydrocephalus&quot;. This is also incorrect. This study was entitled &quot;Hydrocephalus in the Dog: Utility of Ultrasonography as an Alternate Diagnostic Imaging Technique&quot; published in Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association in 1992. The question that this study actually addressed was whether ventricles and associated cerebrospinal fluid pathways could be investigated by ultrasound through the persistent bregmatic fontanelle (molera). There were 26 dogs in the study of which 6 had clinical hydrocephalous (i.e. were neurologically abnormal). Of the 6 dogs with clinical hydrocephalus (2 x chihuahua, 1 x poodle x, 1 x Pomeranian, 1 x Boston terrier and 1 x Yorkshire terrier), ultrasound through the molera was helpful in confirming the diagnosis of hydrocephalus noninvasively and provided information about dilation of the lateral, 3rd and cranial cerebral aqueduct. Ultrasound through the molera was also useful in revealing ventriculomegaly in 5 of 20 (supposedly) clinically normal dogs and these included Chihuahua (9 months old, mentation depressed), Lhasa Apso (5 weeks old), 2x Shih Tzu (3 and 5 weeks old) and Affenpinscher (9 weeks old – and returned to breeder because dull).The remaining 15 dogs (14 shih tzu and 1 Lhasa Apso) had normal ventricle size according to this ultrasound study. 14/15 of the dogs in the study were 6 weeks old or less i.e. the study was predominantly in puppies not adult dogs. The older dog was a 5 year old Shih Tzu. In other words all the Chihuahua in this study were affected with hydrocephalus and molera; this study did not investigate presence or size of a molera and hydrocephalus.

<text>The Infinity War is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics in 1992. The series was written by Jim Starlin and penciled by Ron Lim, Ian Laughlin, Al Milgrom, Jack Morelli and Christie Scheele.

The storyline is a direct sequel to the 1991 &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; and was followed by &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot; in 1993.

==Publication history==
The story had additional tie-ins including &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #110-112, &quot;Captain America&quot; #408, &quot;Daredevil&quot; #310, &quot;Deathlok&quot; #16, &quot;Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme&quot; #42-47, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #366-370, &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol 1 #27-29, &quot;Marc Spector: Moon Knight&quot; #41-44, &quot;Marvel Comics Presents &quot; #108-111, &quot;The New Warriors&quot; #27, &quot;Nomad&quot; vol. 2, #7, &quot;Quasar&quot; #38-40, &quot;Silver Sable and The Wild Pack&quot; #4-5, &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3, #67-69, &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; #18, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #24, &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #7-10, and &quot;Wonder Man&quot; #13-14. All of these were published between July and November 1992. &quot;What The--?!&quot; #20 featured a parody story about various comedic superheroes struggle against the &quot;Infinity Wart&quot;.

==Plot summary==
When hero Adam Warlock takes possession of the artifact known as the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels the good and evil aspects of his being to become a totally logical being, who can therefore use the Gauntlet wisely. This act recreates his &quot;evil&quot; persona and old foe the Magus, who desires universal conquest and revenge against Warlock and the Titan Thanos. Meanwhile, the effectively emotionless Adam is brought before a &quot;jury&quot; of the cosmic powers and voluntarily surrenders his godhood once he is found to be &quot;guilty&quot; of being unworthy. The Magus collects five cosmic containment units (another name for the Cosmic Cubes), and with the power gained incapacitates the cosmic entity Eternity; creates an interdimensional realm and an army of doppelgängers—evil &quot;mirror&quot; images of Earth&#x27;s superheroes.

After investigating the energy of the containment units, Thanos discovers the Magus and retreats to warn Warlock. Galactus and several of Earth&#x27;s heroes also investigate and then attempt to revive Eternity, as the entity will be required to petition the Living Tribunal, who has decreed that the Infinity Gems can no longer be used in unison in the Earth-616 universe. The rationale is that if the Gauntlet can be reactivated, then the Magus can be removed from existence. The Magus sends the doppelgängers to Earth to distract the heroes, and the evil version of Mister Fantastic detonates a gamma bomb when the heroes assemble at Four Freedoms Plaza. However, the Invisible Woman contains the blast while Thunder God Thor directs the radiation into space, and a surprise attack by the Magus and the doppelgänger of Thanos has the heroes believing the two characters are now allied.

The story climaxes at the Magus&#x27; base: a group of heroes free those who were replaced by doppelgängers; cosmic adventurer Quasar arrives with the Ultimate Nullifier (with Thanos goading Quasar to use it against the Magus knowing that Quasar would also be destroyed) and villains Kang the Conqueror and Doctor Doom appear, hoping to harness the source of the powerful energies detected.

Warlock and the still inactive Gauntlet are captured by the Magus, and both attacked by Doom and Kang. Warlock is defeated and the Magus is severely weakened in the battle and attempts to use the containment units but discovers they have been stolen. Doom betrays and stops Kang, and then demands the Gauntlet from the Magus. Eternity, however, has just been revived and has requested the Gauntlet be reactivated, which the Living Tribunal agrees to. An apparently omnipotent Magus easily defeats Doom and dissolves Quasar, who arrives with the Ultimate Nullifier. Thanos defeats his doppelgänger and distracts the Magus, allowing Warlock to grapple with the villain for the Gauntlet. Warlock releases from the Gauntlet a being that is a of the entity Eternity and his twin, Infinity. The being incapacitates the Magus, allowing Warlock to absorb the Magus into the Soul Gem. The experience places Warlock in a coma.

Thanos reveals to the assembled heroes that the Magus was tricked and never gained omnipotence as the Reality Gem on the Gauntlet—which Thanos is revealed to be the secret guardian of—was a convincing fake. The heroes return to Earth and the final page of the last issue reveals that the containment units have been stolen by Warlock&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; persona, the Goddess. In addition to these developments, Eternity—who is apparently &#x27;deputized&#x27; by the Living Tribunal to make such a decree—thereafter declares that the Gems on the Gauntlet will never be able to be used again as a single unit, no matter what future crisis befalls the universe.

==In other media==
===Film===
In October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part film titled &quot;&quot; written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directed by the Russo brothers. In August 2016, Marvel made an interim announcement that &quot;Infinity War&quot; might be one film, which it later dropped in preference to its original two-part film plans, Part 2 being renamed &quot;&quot;. The Russos also explained that despite its title, the film wasn&#x27;t an adaptation of this storyline, rather primarily based on its predecessor &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;. &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot; was released on April 27, 2018.

===Video games===
* Capcom adapted the storyline into a video game shortly after its release. &quot;Marvel Super Heroes In War of the Gems&quot;, was released in 1996 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
* The 2019 video game &quot;Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order&quot;, a reboot to &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; takes elements from &quot;The Infinity War&quot; storyline and incorporates into its own story.

<doc id="705675" wikidata="Q3793573" url="?curid=705675" title="The Conformist">
<text>The Conformist (&quot;Il conformista&quot;) is a novel by Alberto Moravia published in 1951, which details the life and desire for normality of a government official during Italy&#x27;s fascist period. It is also known for the 1970 film adaptation by Bernardo Bertolucci.

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
A boy named Marcello kills lizards in the yard near his home. He tries to coax his neighbor and friend Roberto into offering approval of this behavior, to no avail. They then fight, and Roberto leaves. After obtaining a slingshot, Marcello fires stones through the fence around Roberto&#x27;s house, killing their family cat instead of Roberto. Marcello is mortified not so much by his actions but by the &quot;abnormality&quot; of his sentiments.

Marcello later witnesses a fight between his parents. His father ultimately chases his mother around the house and attacks her in the bedroom, leaving Marcello torn between whether to rescue his mother or aid his father. 

When the summer is over, Marcello is tormented by his classmates, who use his &quot;effeminate&quot; appearance to question his gender. One day, five classmates follow Marcello from school and try to force him to wear a skirt. Their attack is interrupted by Lino, a chauffeur who then offers to drive Marcello home. En route, Lino appears to proposition Marcello, offering him a pistol in exchange for unspecified actions. Lino, who is a former priest de-frocked for indecent behavior, ultimately stops himself before initiating any actions with Marcello. He begs Marcello to ignore him if he tries to speak to him again. Marcello does not fully understand what is happening. Meanwhile, Marcello&#x27;s father vandalizes a photograph of his wife and Marcello by poking holes through their eyes and drawing streaks of blood on their faces.

At school, Marcello decides that the pistol may help him gain his classmates&#x27; respect and meets Lino again. This time, Lino locks himself in his room with Marcello, planning to abuse him. During the struggle, Lino&#x27;s gun comes loose and Marcello grabs it. When Lino asks Marcello to shoot, the latter complies and flees out the window, leaving the pistol behind.

===Part I===
In 1937, Marcello is an employee of the Italian Fascist government, looking through old newspaper clippings for information on the incident with Lino. He ultimately finds an obituary that blames the death on an accident during the cleaning of the gun.

Orlando, a colleague of Marcello, asks him to participate in a mission to Paris. A former professor of Marcello, Quadri, is an anti-fascist agitator, and the Italian government would like to infiltrate his organization. Marcello is also due to be married to someone named Giulia and offers to have his honeymoon in Paris so that his presence there would not raise suspicions.

Marcello also takes confession, despite his apparent atheism, as a prelude to the Catholic wedding Giulia expects. He confesses to murdering Lino, and the priest indicates that he can seek absolution if he feels true remorse for his actions – an emotion that Marcello does not appear capable of feeling.

In the days leading up to the wedding, Marcello&#x27;s mother-in-law lavishingly praises him while his mother lives alone in squalor. For six years, his father has been in an asylum and believes that he is one of Mussolini&#x27;s top aides. Marcello&#x27;s mother gives her son a wedding present but indicates that she will not be attending the ceremony. The two make their monthly visit to his father, who neither recognizes them nor acknowledges their presence.

===Part II===
En route to Paris, Marcello makes a scheduled stop at a brothel in a small town in France, where he is to meet Orlando for further instructions. There, Marcello is mistaken for a client, before Orlando arrives to reveal that the new plan is to kill Quadri. Marcello needs simply to confirm Quadri&#x27;s identity to Orlando to fulfill his duties. While leaving, Marcello realizes that he forgot his hat. When he goes to retrieve it, he finds Orlando with a prostitute to whom Marcello feels some attraction.

Marcello and Giulia visit Quadri. He is married to Lina, a French woman who reminds Marcello of the prostitute. Marcello starts believing that he is in love with Lina despite her apparent dislike for him. Lina allows Marcello to begin to seduce her but always keeps him at arm&#x27;s length, even saying that she and Quadri know that he is a Fascist spy.

While Lina and Giulia head out shopping, he is accosted by an old man who first mistakes him for a beggar and then mistakes him for a homosexual, or perhaps a prostitute, making Marcello revisit the humiliation of the incident with Lino. When the man refuses to drive him back to the hotel, Marcello pulls his gun and demands to be let out of the Rolls.

Marcello&#x27;s feelings for Lina intensify alongside a growing contempt for her when he sees her attempting to seduce Giulia and realizes that her interest in him is merely for show. At a dinner covertly supervised by Orlando, Quadri asks Marcello to secretly post a letter for him on his way back to Italy, as Quadri&#x27;s activities are monitored and the letter might be intercepted otherwise. Marcello refuses, and Quadri takes this as a sign of solidarity, as Marcello could have taken the letter and turned it over to the authorities instead. However, Marcello eventually confirms Quadri&#x27;s identity to Orlando.

While later arguing in a nightclub, Giulia tells Lina that she is not a lesbian and has no interest in an affair. On his trip to Savoy, Quadri – as well as Lina, who left with him in response to Giulia&#x27;s rejection – is killed by Orlando and his men.

===Epilogue===
Marcello has conflicted responses to his role in the death of the couple and tries to rationalize away his culpability. Years later, on the night Mussolini falls from power, Giulia reveals that she has long suspected Marcello&#x27;s involvement in the murders but is sadder for their safety than for his victims or his duplicity.

The two go out for a drive and walk that evening, and while Giulia tries to convince Marcello to have sex with her in a wooded area, a stranger calls to him by name. He turns out to be Lino. Marcello screams at Lino and blames him for ruining his life by taking his innocence. Lino defends himself by arguing that the loss of innocence is inevitable and is merely a part of the human experience. That speech leads Marcello to the beginning of acceptance of his non-conformity.

Marcello, Giulia, and their daughter later drive to the mountains to evade possible reprisals for his role with the government. En route, they drive into an air raid, and their car is strafed with bullets. Giulia and her daughter are killed in the first wave, and Marcello falls out of the car, wounded. Realizing that his wife and daughter are dead, he waits for the second wave to return. Marcello then hears the plane&#x27;s approach.

==Major themes==
Marcello spends the entire novel in search of what he perceives to be a normal life - normal activities, a normal appearance, normal emotions, and so on. However, he confuses normality with conformity, and in his quest to conform, subjugates his already repressed emotions. When the natural course of his life presents him with ethical dilemmas - the assignment to betray Professor Quadri, and his attraction to women other than his wife - he is ill-prepared to deal with them. Moravia also intimates a connection between sexual repression and fascism.

==Plot summary==
When hero Adam Warlock takes possession of the artifact the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels the good and evil aspects of his being to become a totally logical being, who can therefore use the Gauntlet wisely. This act not only freed the incarnation of his evil aspects, Warlock&#x27;s old foe the Magus, but also created an incarnation of his good aspects, the Goddess. During the events of the Infinity War, the Goddess steals the five cosmic containment units (also known as Cosmic Cubes) collected by the Magus. She eventually collects a total of thirty, and uses these to form a &quot;Cosmic Egg&quot; capable of fulfilling wishes.

Using the Egg to create a planet called Paradise Omega, the Goddess kidnaps and brainwashes many of Earth&#x27;s superheroes to act as her army. The heroes chosen are susceptible, as they are either especially religious, mystically inclined, or have had a near-death experience. The characters, led by the heroine Moondragon, are told to defend the Goddess while she meditates on how to rid the universe of all evil.

Heroes Mister Fantastic, the android Vision, and Iron Man investigate the disappearance of their allies and find Paradise Omega. They retreat when attacked by the brainwashed heroes, and contact Professor X, leader of the X-Men, who attempts to speak with Moondragon via telepathy. This results in a telepathic attack that leaves Professor X in a coma. The Titan Thanos is seen as a threat by the Goddess, and is her first target to be attacked, but is inexplicably saved by his enemy Adam Warlock. The Devil, Mephisto, offers his knowledge of the Goddess to Thanos and Warlock in exchange for one of the cosmic containment units, to which they agree.

Armed with Mephisto&#x27;s information, Warlock and Thanos plan to defeat the Goddess. Thanos gathers the heroes of Earth and the Silver Surfer, who, while initially serving the Goddess, has shaken off her control. The Surfer destroys Paradise Omega&#x27;s defences, enabling the heroes to land and battle their friends in what becomes a battle to the death. Thanos, boosting his own telepathic powers with those of the comatose Professor X, attacks the Goddess at the moment she activates her plan. Rationalizing that evil will continue to exist while sentient life exists, the Goddess uses the Egg to rewrite existence so that the universe is completely without sentient life.

This, however, proves to be an illusion created by Warlock moments before the Goddess acted to trick her, thus exposing her true goal to her army and depriving her of their loyalty - and the will needed to override the containment unit&#x27;s safeguards against universal destruction. Caught off-guard, the Goddess is attacked simultaneously by Thanos, Warlock, and Professor X, the three striking her on the spiritual plane as the units cannot affect the soul, and she is absorbed into the Soul Gem. The heroes return to Earth, with their battle undone by the Cosmic Egg, before Thanos ordered it to destroy itself, to ensure that its power could never be used by another. Thanos takes a cosmic containment unit for Mephisto and then destroys Paradise Omega. Mephisto receives his payment but realizes the unit is non-functional, as he failed to specify that the artifact must &quot;work&quot;.

<doc id="705680" wikidata="Q4128946" url="?curid=705680" title="Infinity Abyss">
<text>Infinity Abyss is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics from August to October in 2002. The series was written and pencilled by Jim Starlin.

==Plot summary==
The series centers on the Thanosi, five failed genetic experiments by the Titan Thanos, with each being a clone of his DNA and modelled on other beings, including the characters Professor X; Doctor Strange; Gladiator; Iron Man and Galactus. Obsessed with nihilism and a desire to end the universe, the five Thanosi – called &quot;X&quot;; &quot;Mystic&quot;; &quot;Warrior&quot;; &quot;Armor&quot; and &quot;Omega&quot; – attempt to kill the original Thanos by creating a black hole in space. X then impersonates Thanos and directs character Pip the Troll to kidnap a recovering Adam Warlock on an alien planet.

X requires information from Warlock, who previously made contact with an entity called the &quot;Anchor of Reality&quot;. By killing this being and preventing it from locating a successor, the Thanosi clones will therefore end the universe. The female mercenary Gamora locates the real Thanos, and with the aid of Warlock and heroes Doctor Strange; Spider-Man; Captain Marvel and Moondragon the Titan neutralizes four of the five clones. Omega arrives on Earth to kill the successor to the Anchor of Reality and to destroy the Earth, and is teleported with the heroes to a barren planet where they battle. Thanos transports the heroes back to Earth, and then has a fleet of alien mercenaries destroy the planet, killing the final clone. A human girl called Atleza is able to become the new Anchor of Reality unchallenged, ending the threat.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a trade paperback:

<doc id="705687" wikidata="Q722463" url="?curid=705687" title="Stanisław Koniecpolski">
<text>Stanisław Koniecpolski (1591 – 11 March 1646) was a Polish military commander, regarded as one of the most talented and capable in the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was also a magnate, a royal official (&quot;starosta&quot;), a castellan, a member of the Polish nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), and the &quot;voivode&quot; (governor) of Sandomierz from 1625 until his death. He led many successful military campaigns against rebelling Cossacks and invading Tatars. From 1618 he held the rank of Field Crown Hetman before becoming the Grand Crown Hetman, the military commander second only to the King, in 1632.

Koniecpolski&#x27;s life was one of almost constant warfare. Before he had reached the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he took part in the Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans&#x27; Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in modern Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmatów brought him international fame and recognition.

==Youth==
The details of Stanisław Koniecpolski&#x27;s birth are unclear. Various dates between 1590 and 1594 have been provided, and none of his biographers identify where he was born. What is known, though, is that his father, Aleksander Koniecpolski, was a wealthy magnate belonging to the &quot;szlachta&quot; (Polish nobility) and was also the voivode of Sieradz, and a staunch supporter of King Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa. Koniecpolski&#x27;s mother, Anna Sroczycka, was the daughter of Stanisław Sroczycki, the voivode of Kamianets-Podilskyi, and had brought several large Podole estates into the Koniecpolski family upon her marriage to Aleksander. Stanisław&#x27;s brothers were Krzysztof, who held the court office of &quot;chorąży wielki koronny&quot; (Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown) and was voivode of Bełsk from 1641; Remigiusz, who was the bishop of Chełm before his death in 1640; Jan, a castellan and the voivode of Sieradz; and Przedbór who died in 1611.

Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, when he was 15, through his father&#x27;s influence in the royal court, he secured an appointment as &quot;starosta&quot; (mayor) of Wieluń. In 1603 he began studying at the Kraków Academy, and after several years he was sent to the royal court by his father so that he could continue his education in a more practical fashion. He is believed to have stayed there a year or two. He may also have undertaken a tour of Western Europe for several months, spending the majority of his time in France before returning to his family&#x27;s estates.

==Early career: 1610–1626==
From a young age Koniecpolski chose to follow a military career. In 1610, together with his brother Przedbór, he took part in the Dymitriads against Muscovy, raising a group of 300 men to join the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at Smolensk. On 4 July 1610 he participated in the Battle of Klushino before joining the Siege of Smolensk where Przedbór was crushed to death by the fortress&#x27; collapsing walls on 8 July 1611. After returning to his family mansion at Koniecpol with his brother&#x27;s body, the following autumn Koniecpolski rejoined the army. Under the command of Grand Lithuanian Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, he took part in the effort to relieve and supply the besieged Polish forces in the Moscow Kremlin. During that time, he was entrusted by the Hetman with command of the right flank of the Polish forces.

In 1612 Koniecpolski joined the &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot; (regular Commonwealth army) in Ukraine under the command of Field Crown Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, who greatly influenced his career. In 1614 he was entrusted with destroying rebellious regular units led by Jan Karwacki, and on 17 May, with Stanisław Żółkiewski&#x27;s son, Jan, he won the Battle of Rohatyn and captured Karwacki. In 1615 he married Żółkiewski&#x27;s daughter Katarzyna (Catherine). Soon after the wedding, he received the official rank of &quot;podstoli koronny&quot; (Crown Master of the Pantry).

Throughout 1615 and 1616 Koniecpolski gained further experience in Ukraine, fighting the Tatar hordes, but failed to destroy or capture any sizable enemy units. In 1616, Katarzyna died while giving birth to Koniecpolski&#x27;s first son, Andrzej. The following year, Koniecpolski took part in the Moldavian Magnate Wars alongside Żołkiewski, and stood against Iskender Pasha&#x27;s powerful Turkish army. The conflict ended that year with a negotiated cease-fire. Following negotiations with the Cossacks in Olszanica, Koniecpolski reduced the Cossack register to 1,000, thereby limiting the number of positions that the Cossacks could hold in the Commonwealth military. He also banned raids on the Black Sea. Such raids, which pillaged wealthy Ottoman cities, contributed to the Cossacks&#x27; income but provoked retaliatory raids into Commonwealth territory.
In 1618, during a session of the &quot;Sejm&quot;—the Commonwealth parliament—King Sigismund III Vasa granted the &quot;buława&quot; (ceremonial mace or baton) of Grand Crown Hetman to Stanisław Żółkiewski and that of Field Crown Hetman to Koniecpolski, disregarding the opposition of magnate Krzysztof Zbaraski and his allies. Soon afterward, Koniecpolski was defeated by the Tatars near Orynin, where he committed the mistake of pursuing the enemy against overwhelming odds and barely made it out of the battle alive. In 1619, Koniecpolski married Krystyna Lubomirska, who gave birth to a son, Aleksander, the following year.

That year Koniecpolski and Żólkiewski led an army to Moldova to protect Gaspar Graziani, an ally of the Commonwealth. The army numbered over 7,000 and included the private regiments of the Korecki, Zasławski, Kazanowski, Kalinowski and Potocki magnates. During the Battle of Cecora (Ţuţora) Koniecpolski commanded the right flank of the Commonwealth forces, which were defeated on 19 September by a combined force belonging to Iskender Pasha and Kantymir (Khan Temir). After retreating in good order, the army&#x27;s morale fell and while Koniecpolski prevented the army&#x27;s disintegration on 20–21 September, during the later stages of the retreat its resolve collapsed and the men ran for the river. In the ensuing battle, Żólkiewski was killed and Koniecpolski and many magnates including Samuel Korecki, Mikołaj Struś, Mikołaj Potocki, and Jan and Łukasz Żółkiewski were taken captive. The prisoners were transported to Białograd (Bilhorod), to Iskender Pasha, then to the Castle of Seven Towers at Constantinople, where they were held in the Black Tower. Polish-Ottoman relations stabilized in the wake of the Ottoman defeat at Khotyn in 1621, and in the spring of 1623 the prisoners returned to Poland after a diplomatic mission by Krzysztof Zbaraski purchased their freedom for 30,000 thalers.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Khotyn, a treaty had been signed that aimed to prevent further border hostilities. While Khan Canibek Giray resolved to respect the treaty&#x27;s provisions, Kantymir continued to raid the borderlands in an effort to usurp Canibek Giray&#x27;s position. Following fresh raids by Kantymir&#x27;s forces in June 1623, Koniecpolski was given command of local Commonwealth forces and ordered to stop the incursions. Early the following year, the Budjak horde, under Kantymir&#x27;s command, attacked southern Poland. On 6 February, Koniecpolski intercepted one of the Budjak armies and destroyed it near Szmańkowice and Oryszkowce. Later that year, after Kantymir&#x27;s forces crossed the border in early June, Koniecpolski inflicted a further defeat on him at the Battle of Martynów. Using a new strategy that employed light Cossack cavalry to drive Kantymir&#x27;s forces towards fortified tabors where they were attacked by small arms and artillery, Koniecpolski forced the khan&#x27;s troops to retreat in disarray. His victory was soon celebrated throughout the Commonwealth and, as a reward, Koniecpolski was granted 30,000 zlotys by the Sejm. He was also appointed voivode of Sandomierz.

In 1625, during the Zhmailo Uprising the Zaporozhian Cossacks, led by Marek Zhmaylo, rebelled. Joining forces with Shahin Giray, they attempted to form an alliance with Moscow. Reasoning that the Tatars had their share of trouble with the Porte and that Kantymir&#x27;s Budjak horde would be unable to send major assistance, Koniecpolski gathered a 12,000-strong army of regular and private units to deal with the rebellion. He pledged fair treatment to all Cossacks loyal to the Commonwealth, and death to rebels. On 25 October 1625, near Kryłów, he launch a cavalry attack against the Cossacks. His initial thrusts were stopped and the Cossacks fell back toward Lake Kurukove where they checked a secondary attack. As the tide of battle went against him, Koniecpolski&#x27;s position was at one point described as &quot;grave&quot;; however, the conflict eventually ended in a negotiated cease-fire. This was formalized by the Treaty of Kurukove on 6 November under which the Cossack register was set at 6,000, and the Cossacks again promised to stop raiding the Black Sea shores and provoking the Tatars.

In late January 1626 the Tatars invaded again. With an army estimated at between 15,000 and 20,000, they raided and pillaged territories as far north as the Podole Voivodeship, passing Ternopil and Terebovlia, while some advanced units reached the cities of Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Lviv. In response, Koniecpolski gathered some 13,000 troops and moved to intercept the Tatars, but they refused to engage. Eventually Koniecpolski defeated the rear guard of the main Tatar army, which crossed the borders with much treasure and slaves. Later that year, fearing a repeat invasion, Koniecpolski violated a Sejm resolution in recruiting and fielding an army of 8,000 against an expected Tatar second wave. During this time, Koniecpolski was aided in a number of battles by a highly capable officer, Bohdan Khmelnytsky; Khmelnytsky would also score a major victory over the Tatars later that year, after Koniecpolski had departed north to a new battlefield near the Baltic Sea.

==Fighting Gustavus Adolphus: 1626–1629==

In 1626 the southern threat to the Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by Swedish forces reignited the Polish–Swedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gdańsk (Danzig). Having taken Piława and Braniewo, Swedish forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, Elbląg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starogard, while other Swedish forces landed near Puck—the main port of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet—and captured it. The major city of Gdańsk, however, refused to surrender even in the face of lightning Swedish advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 near the village of Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements from other parts of the country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the Swedish incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia.

Koniecpolski&#x27;s force of 4,200 light cavalry, 1,000 dragoons, and 1,000 infantry quickly moved to Prussia. Reinforced by other units, he had 9,000 men against the 20,000-strong Swedish force. Employing maneuver warfare, using small mobile units to strike at enemy communication lines and smaller units, he stopped the Swedish attack and forced Axel Oxenstierna into a defensive posture. Meanwhile, the Sejm agreed to raise money for the war. The situation of the Commonwealth forces, short of money and food, was difficult. Lithuanian forces were dealt a serious defeat near Koknese, Inflanty Voivodeship, in December 1626 and they subsequently retreated behind the Dvina River. The Swedes then planned to strike Koniecpolski from two directions: Oxenstierna, from the Vistula River, and Johann Streiff von Lawentstein and Maxymilian Teuffl, from Swedish-held Pomorze. The flooding of the Vistula, however, disrupted their plans and allowed Koniecpolski to intercept the enemy units advancing from Pomerania.

On 2 April 1627 Koniecpolski managed to recapture Puck. He took Czarne (Hamersztyn) on 18 April and forced the Swedish forces to retreat into the city. A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As a result of the series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on the west bank of the Vistula, and with those, their hopes for a quick and decisive victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia.

On 17 May Gustavus landed with 8,000 reinforcements. On the night of 22–23 May, while crossing the Vistula near Kieżmark and Danzig, Gustavus encountered Polish forces. Wounded in the hip, he was forced to retreat. Koniecpolski then decided to take back Gniew and devised a diversionary plan. Polish forces were sent to attempt to take back Braniewo, forcing Gustavus to relieve the siege; then Gustavus followed the retreating Polish army and laid siege to Orneta. Koniecpolski, who had foreseen this, responded with a sudden attack on Gniew, his primary objective, which he captured. Gustavus was reported to be impressed with the speed of Koniecpolski&#x27;s reaction.

Near Tczew, with about 7,800 men—including 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth&#x27;s elite heavy cavalry—Koniecpolski tried to stop the Swedish army from reaching Danzig. On 7–8 August, he encountered a Swedish force consisting of 10,000 men, which included 5,000 infantry, near the swamps of Motława. The Swedes wanted to provoke the Poles into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. The Swedes then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw the Poles within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept high by Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and the Swedes retreated.
Koniecpolski now recognized the need to reform his army and strengthen the firepower of its infantry and artillery to match the Swedes&#x27;. The Swedes, on the other hand, had learned the arts of cavalry charges and melée combat from the Poles. Overall the 1627 campaign had been favorable to the Commonwealth; Puck and Gniew had been retaken, Swedish plans had been thwarted, and the Swedish army had been weakened. The last major engagement of the year saw the surprising defeat of a Swedish flotilla by the small Polish Navy on 28 November 1627 at the Battle of Oliwa.

In 1628 the Polish forces, short of funds, were forced to cease their offensive and go on the defensive. Gustavus Adolphus captured Kwidzyń, Nowe and Brodnica. Koniecpolski counterattacked, putting his small forces to most efficient use—quick cavalry melée attacks, combined with supporting infantry and artillery fire, guerrilla warfare, the use of engineers to raise fortifications, and clever use of terrain advantage. Despite his best efforts, he was hampered by insufficient funds. The Sejm increased funding for the war after the Battle of Górzno, where Stanisław &quot;Rewera&quot; Potocki was defeated. Austria sent the Commonwealth help in the form of forces under Field Marshal Johann Georg Arnheim. Arnheim, however, refused to take orders from Koniecpolski.
The final battle took place on 27 June 1629 near Trzciana (or Trzcianka). The Swedes attacked toward Grudziądz, were halted, and retreated to Sztum and Malbork. Koniecpolski attacked the rear guard, which was led by Jan Wilhelm Reingraff, Count of Ren, and destroyed it. He also repelled a counterattack by Swedish , who were pushed toward Pułkowice, where another counterattack was led by Gustavus Adolphus with 2,000 . This counterattack was also fended off, and the Swedish forces were saved from total defeat by the last Swedish reserves, led by Field Marshal Herman Wrangel, who blocked the Polish attack. Gustavus Adolphus was wounded and barely escaped. Of the Swedes, 1,200 were killed, and Reingraff and several hundred others were captured. Polish losses were under 200 killed or injured.

Poland did not follow up this victory politically or militarily. A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the right to tax Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% of the value of goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic coast. Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion.

==Grand Crown Hetman: 1630–1637==

In 1630, the Cossack leader, Taras Fedorovych, executed the moderate Hryhoriy Chorny, and began a Cossack uprising, later dubbed the &quot;Fedorovych Uprising&quot;. Soon afterwards he captured the fortress of Korsun. In an effort to restore the situation, Koniecpolski laid siege to Pereyaslav. Lacking artillery and infantry support, he could not breach its walls, but the Cossacks, needing supplies and having suffered heavy casualties, agreed to negotiate. The Treaty of Pereyaslav, signed in August 1630, granted liberal terms, including amnesty for the rebels. Koniecpolski, as usual, was for harsh punishment, but also argued that in the long run the Cossack situation was better remedied by more equitable treatment, including an increase in the Cossack register and the regular payment of wages. Still, he supported policies aimed at turning the Cossacks into serfs, which was one of the main causes of unrest in Ukraine; this, along with his decision to settle his soldiers&#x27; living expenses on the local populace instead of paying them wages, led to his extreme unpopularity in Ukraine.

In 1632, a few months before his death, King Sigismund III Vasa awarded Koniecpolski the post of Grand Crown Hetman. It had stood vacant for 12 years, since the death of Stanisław Żółkiewski; presumably King Sigismund had feared that Koniecpolski, if given the post earlier, would have become too powerful a magnate. After the King&#x27;s death, Koniecpolski played a major role in directing the political affairs of the Commonwealth and in 1632 supported the election of Sigismund&#x27;s son, Władysław IV Vasa, as king. In return, a year after his election, King Władysław IV rewarded Koniecpolski with the office of Castellan of Kraków, the most prestigious of the Commonwealth&#x27;s district offices. Koniecpolski became an influential adviser to the new king, often encouraging him to direct Polish foreign policy against the Tartars. Koniecpolski also supported King Władysław IV&#x27;s military reforms. Though generally seen as a supporter of the King, Koniecpolski opposed some of his plans aimed at increasing royal power in the Commonwealth and weakening the Golden Liberty of the nobility.
In 1633 Koniecpolski thwarted the Turks&#x27; attacks on the Commonwealth, defeating their forces on 4 July at Sasowy Róg. On 22 October that year, he repulsed a superior invading Ottoman force of over 20,000 at Kamianets-Podilskyi, his own forces numbering 11,000. The Ottoman defeats and Koniecpolski&#x27;s attitude persuaded the Turks to sign a new treaty on 19 August 1634. The treaty repeated the terms of the Treaty of Chocim of 1621 and ended the Ottoman–Commonwealth War (1633–34).

In 1635, in the short lived Sulima Uprising, after Cossacks under Ivan Sulyma captured and destroyed the Polish Kodak Fortress (near modern Dnipro), Koniecpolski led an expedition that retook the fort and punished the insurgents. Sulima was taken prisoner and executed.

Later that year Koniecpolski returned to Pomerania to prepare for another war against Sweden, but it was rendered unnecessary by the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś.

Koniecpolski grasped the need to modernize the Commonwealth&#x27;s military and worked with King Władysław IV to that end, including the recruitment of mercenaries experienced in western warfare, and further development of artillery (he supervised the construction of arsenals at Kudak, Bar and Kamieniec Podolski, and built forges on his Ukrainian estates). He was patron to many gifted artillery and engineering officers. He may also have sponsored cartographers such as William le Vasseur de Beauplan, who mapped Ukraine, and Sebastian Aders, who mapped Crimea. He also supported plans to create a Commonwealth Baltic Fleet.

==Last years: 1637–1645==

After 1637 Koniecpolski&#x27;s declining health made him reliant on the younger Hetman Mikołaj Potocki, who successfully crushed Cossack uprisings in 1637 and 1638, and a Tartar uprising in 1639. Koniecpolski&#x27;s influence also protected the outlaw Samuel Łaszcz, whom he saw as another able commander.

One of Koniecpolski&#x27;s greatest victories occurred during a winter 1644 campaign against Tatars. With a large army of some 19,000 soldiers (60% of them, magnates&#x27; private armies; Koniecpolski&#x27;s own forces numbered 2,200) he dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey&#x27;s forces near Ochmatów on 30 January 1644. Many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice over the water gave way. The Battle of Ochmatów, the Commonwealth&#x27;s greatest victory over the Tatars in the first half of the 17th century, brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the time and place of their attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual tactic of splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (&quot;czambuls&quot;).

The victory led King Władysław IV to consider an offensive war against the Turks. Koniecpolski supported a limited war against the Crimean Khanate but opposed the King&#x27;s plan to wage war on the entire Ottoman Empire, believing it to be an unrealistic folly. Setting out his strategic views in a plan titled &quot;Dyskurs o zniesieniu Tatarow krymskich i lidze z Moskwą&quot; (Discourse on Destruction of the Crimean Tartars and on coalition with Moscow), Koniecpolski also strongly urged a coalition with Moscow for such a campaign. King Władysław IV continued to push for a crusade against Turkey, but it had little internal support and failed to achieve anything except to spread false hopes among the Cossacks, to whom he promised privileges and money in exchange for their participation.

On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski&#x27;s wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski remarried soon after, taking the hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski&#x27;s death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage was the cause of his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.

==Wealth and influence==
Over the course of his life, Koniecpolski accumulated much wealth. Most of his possessions were in Ukraine, and he became Ukraine&#x27;s unofficial ruler; some foreigners referred to him as &quot;viceroy of Ukraine&quot;, though no such Commonwealth position ever existed. King Władysław IV trusted him with most political decisions concerning this southeastern region of the Commonwealth. With the knowledge and support of the King, Koniecpolski sent and received diplomatic missions from Constantinople, carried out negotiations and signed treaties, and as the Grand Crown Hetman he directly controlled a substantial part of the Commonwealth&#x27;s military. He had his own private army and an espionage network that stretched from Moscow to the Ottoman Empire.

Koniecpolski inherited some seven or eight villages from his father. At his death, he owned 12 starostwo districts, with over 300 settlements, including dozens of towns, giving him yearly revenues of over 500,000 złoty. His holdings of land and serfs in western Ukraine were considerable; he owned 18,548 households in Bratslav. Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth in developing his Ukrainian estates, and supported settlement of underpopulated regions. He founded and sponsored the development of many towns and cities, including the town of Brody, which flourished with his investments, and became an important local commercial center. Koniecpolski fortified the town with a citadel and bastions in 1633 and set up workshops for producing Persian-type samite fabrics, carpets and rugs. He also constructed a fortified palace in Pidhirtsi (Podhorce) with beautiful Italian gardens. Like most magnates, Koniecpolski was a patron of the arts, sponsoring painters, sculptors, writers. He also founded many churches and sought to upgrade Brody&#x27;s school to an academy. He sponsored the construction of the Koniecpolski Palace (now the Presidential Palace) in Warsaw, and military fortifications in Bar and Kudak.

Regarded as a courteous and educated man, Koniecpolski participated in all the Sejm sessions that he could, though he rarely spoke publicly due to his stutter. He was widely respected and highly popular among his &quot;szlachta&quot; peers.

Informational notes

*a. The year of Koniecpolski&#x27;s birth is not certain and several different dates are provided by historians. The earliest date mentioned is 1590, while 1594 is the latest. Leszek Podhorodecki, in his biography &quot;Stanisław Koniecpolski ok. 1592–1646&quot;, states that 1591 is the date that is most commonly given by historians, noting that &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; provides this date. Nevertheless, Podhorodecki chose to mark Koniecpolski&#x27;s date of birth as , based on the diary of Karol Ogier, a French courtier, who noted that in 1635 Koniecpolski was 43 years old. The date of 1593 or 1594 has also been proposed in historian Władysław Czapliński&#x27;s &quot;Polski Słownik Biograficzny&quot;. In discussing this possibility, Podhorodecki recognizes Czapliński as &quot;a great specialist of that era&quot;, while noting, though, that his work fails to justify this date.
*b. Podhorodecki gives slightly different estimates—just over 15,000 (including low-quality Gdańsk infantry) against 21,000.

<text>Jakarta XML Binding (JAXB; formerly Java Architecture for XML Binding) is a software framework that allows Java EE developers to map Java classes to XML representations. JAXB provides two main features: the ability to &quot;marshal&quot; Java objects into XML and the inverse, i.e. to &quot;unmarshal&quot; XML back into Java objects. In other words, JAXB allows storing and retrieving data in memory in any XML format, without the need to implement a specific set of XML loading and saving routines for the program&#x27;s class structure. It is similar to codice_1 and codice_2 in the .NET Framework.

JAXB is particularly useful when the specification is complex and changing. In such a case, regularly changing the XML Schema definitions to keep them synchronised with the Java definitions can be time-consuming and error-prone.

JAXB is one of the APIs in the Jakarta EE platform (formerly Java EE), part of the Java Web Services Development Pack (JWSDP), and one of the foundations for WSIT. It was also part of the Java SE platform (in version Java SE 6–10). As of Java SE 11, JAXB was removed. For details, see JEP 320.

JAXB 1.0 was released in 2003, having been developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 31. In 2006 JAXB 2.0 was released under JSR 222 and Maintenance Release 2 released in December 2009. Reference implementations for these specifications were available under the CDDL open source license at java.net.

== Usage ==
The tool &quot; can be used to convert XML Schema and other schema file types (as of Java 1.6, RELAX NG, XML DTD, and WSDL are supported experimentally) to class representations. Classes are marked up using annotations from namespace, for example, and . XML list sequences are represented by attributes of type . Marshallers and Unmarshallers are created through an instance of JAXBContext.

In addition, JAXB includes a &quot; tool that can essentially perform the inverse of &quot;&quot;, creating an XML Schema from a set of annotated classes.

== Default data type bindings ==
The table below lists the mappings of XML Schema (XSD) data types to Java data types in JAXB.

==Versions==

<doc id="705691" wikidata="Q320244" url="?curid=705691" title="Junkers Jumo 222">
<text>The Jumo 222 was a German high-power multiple-bank in-line piston aircraft engine from Junkers, designed under the management of Ferdinand Brandner of the Junkers Motorenwerke.

Such was the projected performance of the engine compared to contemporary designs that many developments of wartime Luftwaffe piston-engined aircraft designs were based on it, at least as an option. These included the entire Bomber B program, which looked to replace all existing Luftwaffe bombers with a new twin-engine design that was larger, faster and more heavily armed than any aircraft in their inventory.

The design failed to mature even after years of intensive development and several major design changes. The Bomber B program failed along with it, leaving the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with hopelessly outdated designs during the second half of the war. Fewer than three hundred 222s were built. They never left the prototype phase, but the design nevertheless continued appearing on proposals for new Luftwaffe multi-engined designs long after most had given up hope it would ever work.

==Design and development==
Design work on the Jumo 222 started in 1937. The engine was configured with six inline cylinder banks spaced at equal angles around the crankcase, each bank having four cylinders. The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement — this was evident from a cross-sectional drawing of the original version, using a master connecting rod with five additional connecting rods pivoted from the master rod&#x27;s crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial. But the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines.

Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a &quot;nose-on&quot; view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60° equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the &quot;60°, 180° &amp; 300°&quot; spaces) and intake ports (at the &quot;0°, 120° &amp; 240°&quot; spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler &quot;plumbing&quot; from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers. The trio of exhaust header sets would have been most likely present at the bottom of an engine nacelle, and on the upper quarters to either side (appearing like the exhausts for many Allied &quot;upright&quot; V-style aviation engines) for the shortest possible exhaust outlet routing.

The four-cylinder-long multibank design resulted in a shorter engine than the Jumo 211, by roughly , but larger cross-section nacelle design. Like the Ju 88, it could use an annular radiator to cool the 222&#x27;s cylinders and motor oil. The Junkers Ju 288 intended to hide the radiators behind hollow ducted spinners with each of its four-blade propellers.

Each cylinder had two intake valves and a single sodium-cooled exhaust valve — a triple-valve configuration inherited from the first Jumo-series inverted V12 aviation engine, the Junkers Jumo 210 — a high-pressure fuel injector between the intakes, and two spark plugs. With a bore and stroke of , the original Jumo 222A/B engine design had a displacement of 46.4 L (2,831.5 in³), in the same general displacement class as the Double Wasp American eighteen cylinder air-cooled radial of 1937–1940 origin. The 222A/B model was forced to run at a fairly low 6.5:1 compression ratio, the same ratio as used by the volume-produced Jumo 211C inverted-V12 from their firm. Such comparatively low compression ratios were the best possible ones given the low-octane fuels available in Germany, but by increasing the speed of the engine to 3,200 rpm, the 222 delivered at takeoff. The only disappointing feature was the simple, single-stage two-speed supercharger, but even with this limitation, the engine still generated at . The dry weight was , only some heavier than the air-cooled Double Wasp.

Compared with the contemporary BMW 801 and Daimler-Benz DB 605, the 222 was a huge leap in performance. It had only slightly larger displacement than the 801&#x27;s 41.8 L (2,550.8 in³), and about 25% more than the 605&#x27;s 35.7 L (2,178.5 in³), but delivered considerably more power, compared to in the 801 and in the 605. That represents 40 kW/L for the 222, while only 29 kW/L for the 801, and 31 kW/L for the 605. The power-to-weight ratio was 1.7 kW/kg (1.04 hp/lb) for the 222, whereas the 605 delivered 1.4 kW/kg (0.88 hp/lb), and the 801 1 kW/kg (0.60 hp/lb). The 222 also had similar exterior dimensions as these smaller engines, across compared to for the 801, and long compared to for the 605.
The comparison was even more favourable against other high-power engines under development. One such was the BMW 802 18-cyclinder radial, an enlarged version of their highly successful 14-cyclinder BMW 801. However, work didn&#x27;t start until 1939, and while promising, it weighed and was only first run in 1943. BMW also tried putting two 801 radials together in the BMW 803, which was not successful. Then there was the cumbersome DB 606, the first-ever &quot;high-output&quot; powerplant developed in Germany, consisted of two DB 601&#x27;s mounted to a single reduction gear case on their front ends, that delivered with a weight of , and was ft) in size. Their troubled use and deficient installation design in the He 177A, Germany&#x27;s only heavy bomber aircraft to see production and front-line service, prompted &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring to derisively label them in the late summer of 1942 as &quot;welded-together engines&quot;. 

Conversely, the RLM was excited by the possibilities of the much more compact Jumo 222&#x27;s design features, and the X engine configuration, 24 cylinder DB 604, of similar weight and displacement to the 222A but with somewhat lower specific power output. The RLM based their entire Bomber B program on pairs of these engines, which would deliver a bomber with the warload of the He 177 and even better speed than the Ju 88, a truly universal design.

The first prototype engine ran on 24 April 1939, and was later air-tested on the nose-engine mount of a Ju 52. Production called for two primary models, the 222A and 222B, which differed only in the direction that they spun, intended to be used for left-hand (portside wing) and right-hand (starboard wing) engines on twin-engine designs. However, continued testing went poorly, and Junkers eventually decided it was best to stop development of these &quot;Series I&quot; engines and move onto a modified &quot;Series II&quot;. The new 222A-2 and B-2 ran at a slightly slower rpm but had slightly larger cylinders of bore (49.88 litres, 3043.86 in³) for the same net performance, while the A-3 and B-3 used a different supercharger for better performance at higher altitudes. One A-3 and B-3 powerplant each were allegedly fitted to the ninth Junkers Ju 288 prototype airframe for flight tests. Both &quot;uprated&quot; models of the Jumo 222A/B versions continued to prove unreliable, and were fitted only experimentally.

By late 1941, Junkers decided the best course of action was to make more radical changes to the design, and introduced the 222C and 222D models. With a new bore and stroke of , the engine displacement increased a second time, to 55.5 L (3,386.8 in³), just very slightly larger than the contemporary Wright Duplex Cyclone American 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which at the time was having its own significant problems ironed out, partially from the use of combustible magnesium-alloy metal for its crankcase. Back at the original 3,200 rpm, the Jumo 222 C/D models could deliver just under when they started running in the summer of 1942. However, the problems were not cured, and only a handful were built. The RLM had been waiting for three years at this point, and eventually gave up and had all designs based on it look for alternate engines. Later that year, they gave up on that as well, and cancelled the entire Bomber B program outright.
Junkers still did not give up. Using the original 46.4 litre displacement A/B design, they added a new two-stage supercharger including a trio of aftercoolers, one per pair of neighboring cylinder banks for high-altitude use, producing the 222E and F-series. Although sea-level performance was unchanged, the engine was able to produce at . By this point it appeared that the problems were finally being worked out, but bombing of the Junkers Motorenwerke&#x27;s headquarters factories in Dessau made production almost impossible. A final attempt for even higher altitude performance resulted in the turbocharged 222G and H, built only to the extent of a few testbed prototypes.

The Jumo 222 was a massive and very costly failure. 289 examples of the Jumo 222&#x27;s were built in total, none of which saw active service. It also served to seriously hamper Luftwaffe piston-engined designs from 1940 to 1942, while many personnel within the Luftwaffe&#x27;s government-operated technology development offices (like &quot;Oberst&quot; Edgar Petersen&#x27;s chain of several &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; installations) and German military aviation corporate engineering departments waited for the Jumo 222 to finally start working. Meanwhile, all calls for four-engine adaptations in place of twin-engine Jumo 222 powered designs were rejected because it was felt it would place too much strain on the German engine industry. In the end there was nothing to show for it, and late in the war the Luftwaffe was flying barely updated versions of their original pre-war designs.

==Variants==
None of the JuMo 222 variants achieved operational service.
*Jumo 222 A / B-1: first version bore x stroke (135 × 135) = 46,380 cm³, at 3200 min -1, single-stage two-speed centrifugal supercharger, &quot;service-test&quot; A-0/B-0 series, flight tested
*Jumo 222 A / B-2: enlarged variant larger valve cross sections bore x stroke(140 × 135) = 49880 cm³, 2500 hp at 2900 min -1, single-stage two-speed centrifugal supercharger, zero series, flight tested
*Jumo 222 A / B-3: as A / B-2, but improved centrifugal supercharger, full pressure altitude: 6000 m, pilot series, flight-tested
*Jumo 222C / D: further enlarged variant bore x stroke (145 × 140) = 55,480 cm³, 3000 hp at 3200 min -1, full pressure altitude: 10.000 m, by designed V-series experimental models in the assembly
*Jumo 222 E / F:, like A / B-3, with two-stage two-speed centrifugal supercharger and trio of aftercoolers, full pressure altitude: 9400 m, pilot series, flight-tested
*Jumo 222 turbo:, like A / B-3, with turbocharger and intercooling, full pressure altitude: 12,300 m, 2400 hp at 3200 min -1, only test bench
*Jumo 222 G / 225:, projected, lengthened version with 6 × 6 = 36 cylinder bore x stroke (135 × 135) = 69570 cm³, 3500 hp at 3000 min -1, and speed charging increasable
The direction of rotation of the propeller shaft was indicated by the letter - A, C and E turned to the left while B, D and F turned to the right. The crankshaft, however, always ran uniformly to the right; the propeller running direction was varied only by different gears.

Since the Junkers Jumo 222 has six cylinder banks, it is one of the so-called Hexagon engines. Other examples of hexagon engines are rare - for example, the 24-cylinder water-cooled Dobrynin VD-4K and the 12-cylinder air-cooled Curtiss H-1640 Chieftain. Analogously, there were also octagon engines such as the Bristol Hydra with eight cylinder banks.

==Applications==
:Aircraft designs intended to be powered by the Jumo 222:

*Dornier Do 435 (when no jet engine replaced the rear piston engine)
*Focke-Wulf Fw 300
*Heinkel He 219B &amp; -C
*Heinkel He 277 (as a later &quot;Amerikabomber&quot;-related alternative to fitting six BMW 801 radials, late July 1943 development proposal only)
*Hütter Hü 211
*Junkers Ju 288

:Prototype proposals designed to use Jumo 222 engine power:

* Arado E.340 (twin 222s, a &quot;Bomber B&quot; competitor)
* Focke-Wulf Fw P.195 (six/eight Jumo 222s, very large transport aircraft)

<text>The International and State Defense Police (; PIDE) was a Portuguese security agency that existed during the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime of António de Oliveira Salazar. Formally, the main roles of the PIDE were the border, immigration and emigration control and internal and external state security. Over time, it came to be known for its secret police activities.

The agency that would later become the PIDE was established by the Decree-Law 22992 of August 1933, as the [[State Surveillance and Defense Police]] (Polícia de Vigilância e Defesa do Estado) or PVDE. It resulted from the merger of two former agencies, the Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Defense Police. 

PVDE was founded by Captain Agostinho Lourenço, who in 1956 would become the president of Interpol.

The PVDE was transformed into the PIDE in 1945. PIDE was itself transformed into the Directorate-General of Security or DGS in 1968. After the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution, DGS was disbanded in Portugal, but continued to exist transitionally in the Portuguese overseas territories as the Military Information Police or PIM, being finally completely disbanded in 1975.

Although the acronym PIDE was only formally used from 1945 to 1969, the set of successive secret polices that existed during the 40 years of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime are commonly referred to as the PIDE. Historically, this set of police agencies is also often referred as PIDE/DGS, from the acronyms of its two last designations. It is referred to in this last way in article 292 of the Portuguese Constitution, which states its criminalization and judgment of its former officers.

During its existence, the organization was known for its actions during the Spanish Civil War, its role as a political police, its counter-espionage activities during World War II and its counter-insurgency operations in the Portuguese Colonial War.

==History==
===Background===
During the Portuguese First Republic and the following &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; regimes, the police services were reorganized several times, with the remote ancestors of PIDE appearing. 

In 1918, the police services were organized as an umbrella organization named Civic Police, which started to include two agencies that were the remote ancestors of the PIDE: the Preventive Police and the Emigration Police. The first agency was a secret police responsible for the State security. The Preventive Police would become the State Security Police in 1919, the Social Defense Police in April 1919, and the Preventive and State Security Police in October 1919. The Emigration Police was an agency responsible for the border and migration control, with a special focus in the fight against illegal emigration.

After the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état and the establishment of the military &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot;, the Preventive and State Security Police was disbanded. However, soon after, two similar agencies were created, the Lisbon Information Police and the Porto Information Police, respectively under the control of the civil governor of Lisbon and the civil governor of Porto. In 1928, the two agencies were merged into a single Information Police under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In the same year, the Portuguese International Police was created as a section of the Information Police, succeeding the former Emigration Police. In 1931, the Information Police was disbanded and the Portuguese International Police became autonomous, under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In 1932, the Political and Social Surveillance Section of the Portuguese International Police was created, with the same role of the former Information Police. 

With Salazar in office as prime minister, the Political and Social Surveillance Section became autonomous in January 1933, as the Political and Social Surveillance Police. The Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Surveillance Police would merge in August 1933, as the PVDE.

===PVDE===
The origins of PIDE can be traced to 1933, the year of the inauguration of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. Under direct orders from Salazar himself, the Surveillance and State Defence (&quot;Polícia de Vigilância e de Defesa do Estado&quot;) or PVDE was created, with two main sections:
*Social and Political Defence Section, which was used to prevent and repress crimes of a political and social nature (see: Censorship)
*International Section, which was used to control the entrance of immigrants, to expel undesirable immigrants and to take care of counter-espionage and/or international espionage.

PVDE was founded and led by Captain Agostinho Lourenço. According to Professor Douglas Wheeler &quot;an analysis of Lourenco&#x27;s career suggest[s] strongly that British Intelligence Services&#x27; influence had an impact on the structure and activity of PVDE&quot;. Lourenço had earned a reputation with British observers, recorded in a confidential document generated at the British Embassy, which suggested a &quot;pro-British&quot; bias on his part. Lourenço always kept a good relationship with the MI6, which helped him to become the head of the international police organization Interpol in 1956.

In 1936, the prison of Tarrafal was created in the Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. This camp, under the direct control of the PVDE, was the destination for those political prisoners considered dangerous by the regime. Among the first prisoners were the convicted sailors from the 1936 Naval Revolt. The sailors, affiliated with the Communist Party, had attempted to sail two Portuguese Navy ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Throughout the more than 40 years of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, 32 people lost their lives in Tarrafal, which was known for its severe methods of torture.

Also in 1936, with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and in 1937 with the attempt against Salazar&#x27;s life by anarchist terrorists, the PVDE started focusing its battle against communism and the underground Portuguese Communist Party. During this pre-World War II period, several Italian and German advisers came to Portugal to help the PVDE adopt a model similar to the Gestapo.

During World War II, the PVDE experienced its most intense period of activity. Neutral Lisbon was the European center of espionage and one of the favourite exile destinations. Writers such as Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond) were based there, while other prominent people such as the Duke of Windsor and the Spanish Royal Family were exiled in Estoril. German spies attempted to buy information on trans-Atlantic shipping to help their submarines fight the Battle of the Atlantic. The Spaniard Juan Pujol Garcia, better known as Codename Garbo, passed on misinformation to the Germans, hoping it would hasten the end of the Spanish State—he was recruited by Britain as a double agent while in Lisbon. Conversely, William Colepaugh, an American traitor, was recruited as an agent by the Germans while his ship was in port in Lisbon—he was subsequently landed by U-boat, , in Maine before being captured. In June 1943, a commercial airliner carrying the actor Leslie Howard was shot down over the Bay of Biscay by the Luftwaffe after taking off from Lisbon, possibly because German spies in Lisbon believed that Prime Minister Winston Churchill was on board.

Several American reports called Lisbon &quot;The Capital of Espionage&quot;. However, the PVDE always maintained a neutral stance towards foreign espionage activity, as long as no one intervened in Portuguese internal policies.

===PIDE===
In 1945, the PVDE was renamed and replaced by the PIDE. Unlike its predecessor, which sought inspiration in the Gestapo, the regime&#x27;s propaganda alleged PIDE followed the Scotland Yard model. Receiving the same status as the &quot;Polícia Judiciária&quot; (criminal investigation police), it had full powers to investigate, detain, and arrest anyone who was thought to be plotting against the State. It had two main functions:
*Administrative functions (which included those related to the migration services)
*Criminal prevention and repression functions. As there was already in place one criminal investigation police that dealt with ordinary crime, PIDE focused on political and social issues (political opposition, social unrest, student movements), which the political regime criminalised. At the same time, PIDE was the Portuguese police corresponding with the international Interpol network.

PIDE is considered by many authors as being one of the most functional and effective secret services in history . Using a wide network of covert cells, which were spread throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE had infiltrated agents into almost every underground movement, including the Portuguese Communist Party as well as the independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. The PIDE encouraged citizens – the so-called &quot;bufos&quot; (snitches) – to denounce suspicious activities, through the use of monetary and prestige incentives. This resulted in an extremely effective espionage service which was able to fully control almost every aspect of Portuguese daily life. 

PIDE was credited with the torture and assassination of many political activists, controlled the political soundness of any candidate to public employment, vetoing anyone who could be suspicious of favouring the opposition and had extrajudicial powers of detention, so it could retain in prison any activist after he or she had served a sentence. These actions extended beyond politicians and significant activists. For example, law student Aurora Rodrigues was arrested for association with the Portuguese Workers&#x27; Communist Party and was kept awake for weeks and repeatedly drowned.

The PIDE intensified its actions during the Portuguese Colonial War, creating a successful paramilitary unit called Flechas (Arrows). Yves Guérin-Sérac, a former officer of the French Army and founder of the OAS right-wing terrorist group during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), set up &quot;Aginter Press&quot; in Lisbon and participated with the PIDE in covert operations.

===DGS===
In 1969, Marcelo Caetano changed the name PIDE to DGS (&quot;Direcção-Geral de Segurança&quot;, &quot;General Security Directorate&quot;). The death of Salazar and the subsequent ascension of Caetano brought some attempts at democratization, in order to avoid popular insurgency against censorship, the ongoing colonial war, and the general restriction of civil rights. This resulted in a decrease in the perceived level of violence used by the secret police and a consequent reduction in its effectiveness.

==End of PIDE/DGS==
The most dramatic moments of the 1974 Carnation Revolution occurred near the DGS headquarters at António Maria Cardoso Street in Lisbon. Unidentified agents - desperate after being surrounded by rebellious troops and a throng of civilians - opened fire from the top of the building, killing four demonstrators. In turn, a DGS agent was also killed by the rebellious troops when trying to escape. These five people were the sole victims of the coup d&#x27;état which brought down the dictatorship.

This was the last strategic point to be occupied by the insurgents, thus leading to the escape of many of the agents and the destruction of most of the records. In the days following the revolution, most escaped to Spain or went underground. Many of the agents, including the director-general Silva Pais were, however, captured. Of those agents, 89 would later escape from the Alcoentre penitentiary, in a massive and never well-explained prison break in June 1975.

Some of the PIDE/DGS archives were reportedly handed over by the Portuguese Communist Party to Soviet agents.

After being &quot;sanitized&quot;, the corporation continued its operations in the Portuguese colonies under the name of the Military Information Police (&quot;Polícia de Informação Militar&quot;).

A commission was created for the extinction of the secret police. The remainder of the documents since 1990 are in the Torre do Tombo National Archive. They can be accessed, but the names of agents and informers are not disclosed.

The only PIDE agents who faced trial were those responsible for the death of exiled opposition leader Humberto Delgado. They were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and the case dragged on for several years. None of them served time in jail.

The brutality of the PIDE/DGS is dramatised in the 2000 film &quot;April Captains&quot;, about the events of the day of the Carnation Revolution.

Because of the memory of the abuses of the PIDE/DGS in supporting the regime, the establishment of a new civilian intelligence agency was delayed for more than a decade. However, following a terrorist attack on the Embassy of Turkey, the assassination of a Palestine Liberation Organization representative at a Socialist International conference in 1983, and a number of domestic terrorist attacks by isolated far-left and far-right groups, the Portuguese government became convinced of the need for a new intelligence agency. This led to the establishment of the Sistema de Informações da República Portuguesa (SIRP, Intelligence System of the Portuguese Republic) in 1984.

<doc id="705707" wikidata="Q5703262" url="?curid=705707" title="Helen Tamiris">
<text>Helen Tamiris (born Helen Becker; April 23, 1902 – August 4, 1966) was an American choreographer, modern dancer, and teacher. 

Tamiris began her studies in modern dance at the Henry Street Settlement as a child, and began her career in the field of ballet. Tamiris refocused to modern dance, making her solo debut in 1928, with a focus on social activism. Tamiris was a leader in the Federal Theatre Project and its sister projects, arguing for modern dance as an art form, and choreographing multiple productions. In her later career, Tamiris choreographed on Broadway, winning a Tony Award in 1949 for her choreography in &quot;Touch and Go&quot;.

== Early life ==
Tamiris was born Helen Becker in New York City on April 23, 1902, to Isor and Rose (Simonov) Becker. Her parents and brothers Maurice and Charles Becker immigrated from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia a decade earlier, fleeing pogroms. The family settled on the Lower East Side, where many other Russian Jewish immigrants lived at that time. Two more children Samuel and Peter, in addition to Helen, were born in New York City. Becker&#x27;s siblings were similarly artistic. Her oldest brother Maurice became a well-known artist and illustrator; and brothers Samuel and Peter took up sculpting and art collecting, respectively. Rose died when Helen was three, leaving the family in the care of Isor.

As a child, Becker was constantly in motion, and her father enrolled her in dance classes at the Henry Street Settlement at the age of eight. The Henry Street Settlement&#x27;s dance program taught &quot;interpretive dancing,&quot; an early form of modern dance taking inspiration from Dalcroze eurhythmics and the work of Isadora Duncan. The early education with the creative freedom of interpretive dance would inform her work as a choreographer for many years.

Becker attended New York City public schools, graduating from Eastern District High School in 1918, and later studying economics and labor statistics at the Rand School from 1918 to 1920. Her focus on labor statistics preceded her later works in union organizing, a key element of her legacy.

== Ballet training and early career ==
Becker auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet at age 15, and was accepted, despite her lack of ballet and pointe experience. She trained with the Met for one season, then performed in the corps de ballet for four seasons. Before her final season, she joined the Bracale Opera Company as a soloist on a tour of South America in the summer of 1922.

Upon her return from South America, Becker performed with the Met for another season, while studying with Russian ballet choreographer Michel Fokine. She then danced in a Broadway production of &quot;Casanova&quot; for which Fokine choreographed the prologue. Dissatisfied with ballet, Becker studied at the Isadora Duncan School, but left after three months. Her autobiography cited the reasons for leaving as &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a Duncan dancer - or a ballet dancer - I want to be myself - But what was myself?&quot;

With her independence in mind, Becker worked in commercial dance, including at nightclubs and the Music Box Review on Broadway. She took on the stage name of &quot;Tamiris,&quot; from a line in a Persian poem: &quot;Thou art Tamiris, the ruthless queen who banishes all obstacles.&quot;

In October 1927, Tamiris made her premiere as a solo modern dancer, accompanied by composer Louis Horst. A second solo performance in January 1928 included a manifesto in its program, detailing Tamiris&#x27; desires to keep her works contemporary, sincere, and uniquely American. This manifesto was possibly in reaction to the works of Tamiris&#x27; contemporaries Martha Graham and Angna Enters; they had performed at the same venue weeks after Tamiris&#x27; debut, and Tamiris was in disagreement with some of their principles. The second performance included two short pieces set to spirituals, the first of a series that would define her career. Tamiris traveled to Europe in 1928, performing in Berlin, Salzburg, and Paris, and furthering her distinct style.

== Great Depression and Federal Dance Project ==
In the early 1930s, Tamiris collaborated with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, and later Agnes de Mille to form the Dance Repertory Theatre. The company was financially successful, but dissolved in 1932. Many of its members went on to form the Bennington College School of Dance, but Tamiris remained independent of this group. A 2000 analysis by dance scholar Julia Foulkes argues that Tamiris&#x27; exclusion from the Bennington College program was due to either antisemitism or backlash against Tamiris&#x27; involvement with leftist politics.

The Great Depression and the programs created to mitigate it, including the Works Progress Administration, had a large impact on Tamiris&#x27; work. Tamiris&#x27; advocacy led to the expansion of the Federal Dance Project under the WPA, and she later became the director of the Federal Theatre Project.

While working with the FDP, Tamiris simultaneously acknowledged that it was not a full solution to the issue of unemployed dancers. Tamiris wanted dancers to be understood as laborers, due to the significant physical demands of their work, and believed that the difficulties faced by dancers in the workplace were relevant to contemporaneous labor movements.

Much of Tamiris&#x27; known work deals with social issues like racism and war. She is best known for her suite of dances, &quot;Negro Spirituals,&quot; created between 1928 and 1942. Eight pieces of this suite were performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in April 1939, in a program shared with Hanya Holm. A contemporaneous piece, &quot;How Long Brethren?&quot; (1937), was danced to protest songs, and won &quot;Dance Magazine&quot;&#x27;s first award for group choreography.Tamiris choreographed and danced in &quot;Trojan Incident&quot; (1938), a contemporary interpretation of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; directed by Hallie Flanagan. &quot;Trojan Incident&quot; played 26 performances at the St. James Theatre, a short run that nonetheless drew intense attention from Broadway producers, who feared that its low ticket prices were undercutting their commercial works. More consequentially, &quot;Trojan Incident&quot; was referenced as part of the backlash against the Federal Theatre Project, which eventually led to its shutdown. The final example of Tamiris&#x27; work for the Federal Theatre Project before its closure is &quot;Adelante&quot; (1939), a critique of the Spanish Civil War.

== Musical theatre career ==

Modern dancer and choreographer Daniel Nagrin saw Tamiris&#x27; works as early as 1936, and joined her company in 1941. They married in September 1946, and continued to collaborate professionally.

Tamiris choreographed for musical theatre in the 1940s and mid-1950s, insisting on racial integration in her casts. This, along with her earlier union organizing and antiwar activism, prompted an FBI investigation and accusations of Communism. Tamiris was listed in &quot;Red Channels&quot; in 1950, and despite an internal FBI review in 1955 denying her affiliation with the Communist Party, her legacy was likely affected greatly by the blacklisting.

Tamiris won a Tony Award for Best Choreography in &quot;Touch and Go&quot; (1949). Her other musical theatre choreography includes &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1946), &quot;Up in Central Park&quot; (1947), &quot;Flahooley&quot; (1951), &quot;Carnival in Flanders&quot; (1953), &quot;Fanny&quot; (1954), and &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot; (1955).

== Later life and legacy ==
Tamiris and Nagrin separated personally and professionally in 1964. Tamiris was diagnosed with cancer shortly after their separation, and retreated from public view. Tamiris died on August 5, 1966, at the age of 64.

Tamiris was not interested in developing a codified technique of her own, unlike her contemporaries. Tamiris&#x27; collaborative attitude towards choreography, encouraging her dancers to utilize their &quot;inner action,&quot; and her focus on content over form, is argued by contemporary scholars to constitute a distinct style.

Despite the magnitude of her works, Tamiris&#x27; legacy is less known than that of her peers. Washington Post dance critic Alan M. Kriegsman described her as &quot;the great unsung pioneer of American dance.&quot; Tamiris&#x27; longtime partner Daniel Nagrin attributed Tamiris&#x27; lesser-known legacy to her intense social, political, and artistic passion, which he argued frightened her peers; and to Tamiris&#x27; use of jazz in her early works, when its legitimacy may have still been in question. Contrastingly, New York Times critic Jack Anderson argued that Tamiris&#x27; legacy was marred by personal rivalries among her peers. In a 1988 essay, dance historian Susan Manning criticized Tamiris for using white dancers to convey Black experience, calling it &quot;metaphorical blackface&quot;.

Tamiris drafted an autobiography, but did not finish it before her death. A revised version of the draft, annotated by Nagrin, was published by the Society of Dance History Scholars in 1989. The revised draft covers Tamiris&#x27; childhood and early career, ending before her 1928 trip to Europe.

<text>Color recovery is a technique used in Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s 1990s workstation graphics devices to produce a &#x27;near 24-bit&#x27; color look from an 8-bit framebuffer. Color recovery does rely on software support which is provided by libraries such as PHIGS, PEXLib, Starbase and Xlib (although Xlib does not enable it by default).

When using Color Recovery the data is sent to the driver as a 24-bit image. The driver will then dither the data (in most cases this can be done by the graphics hardware for maximum performance) which is stored in the framebuffer as an 8-bit image. On displaying that 8-bit image data, HP&#x27;s color recovery technology produces in real time an approximation of the original 24-bit image based on the hints provided by the dithered data. The result is significantly better looking than dithering alone. According to the article in HP&#x27;s journal, the technique could achieve up to 23 bits of color accuracy.

Color Recovery was supported on framebuffers such as:

*The integrated framebuffer in the HP 9000/712 workstation
*HCRX framebuffer
*Visualize EG

<text>Cardiff Metropolitan University Football Club (), commonly known as Cardiff Met F.C., are a Welsh football club, of the Athletic Union of Cardiff Metropolitan University, based in Cyncoed, Cardiff that plays in the . The club badge features the bowman with the words &quot;&quot;I lwyddo, rhaid chwarae&quot; which is translated as &quot;To succeed, [one] must play&quot;&quot;.

==History==

=== Origins: 1964-2000 ===
Cardiff Met F.C. was originally founded sometime before 1964 as the Cardiff College of Education F.C. They made their Welsh Amateur Cup debut in 1964, defeating Pembroke Borough 3–2 in their inaugural game and Dunlop Semtex 3–0 in the third round before suffering elimination in round 4 at the hands of Merthyr Tydfil.

During the 1966–67 and 1969–70 seasons, Cardiff College of Education reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup every year, winning the cup on 2 occasions in 1968 and 1969 beating Welshpool and Tonyrefail Welfare respectively.

During the 1972–73 season, Cardiff College joined the second division of the Welsh Football League, finishing a creditable 7th (amongst 19 teams) in their first season. The following season the club ended the campaign in 10th place and again reached the final of the Welsh Amateur Cup, losing 2–1 to Whitchurch Alport. The 1974–75 season saw the club promoted to the second tier of Welsh football for the first time following a second-place finish behind eventual champions Blaenavon Blues, despite ending the season level on points.

The 1975–76 season saw the club complete a league and FAW Intermediate Cup double, scoring over 100 goals in the process. The promotion meant the club would be playing at the top level of Welsh Football for the first time in its history. However, after two seasons in the Welsh League South Premier Division, the 1978–79 season saw the team record only one win and its lowest ever points tally to finish bottom of the league. During this season, they renamed themselves to South Glamorgan Institute F.C. in 1979 when their host college (Cardiff) merged with neighbouring colleges.

In the following 7 seasons, the club recorded consistent mid-table finishes until the 1986–87 season when the club was once again relegated back to the third tier of Welsh football for the first time since 1974. Before the 1990 season, the college renamed itself to Cardiff Institute of Higher Education, so the club once again rebranded to Cardiff Institute of Higher Education F.C. for the 1990–1991 season.

Once again, the club was demoted to the Welsh League Division 3 following the inception of the League of Wales in 1992. It was not until the 1995–96 season that the club was promoted back to level 3 of the Welsh Pyramid, scoring 104 goals in 28 league games and without losing a game all season. Back-to-back promotions were confirmed the following season as the Archers secured a second-place finish, six points behind champions Bridgend Town.

=== Merge with Inter Cardiff: 2000-2012 ===
After 3 seasons in Welsh League Division 1, it was announced that the club would be merging with Inter Cardiff to form a new club, UWIC Inter Cardiff, for the 2000–01 season of the League of Wales. With only 3 wins and 13 points, the club was relegated after one season. They returned to the Welsh League Division 1 where they remained until the 2006–07 campaign which saw the Archers demoted to Division 2.

In 2009, the club again rebranded to UWIC and appointed former professional footballer and Welsh international Christian Edwards as their Director of Football. Edwards was ably assisted by Professor Robyn Jones, who was part of the Sutton United team that dumped Coventry City out of the FA Cup in 1989. Initially, the club dropped back into Welsh League Division 3 due to a Cymru Premier restructure. Whilst the 2010–11 season ended with a mid table finish, the club equaled their best Welsh Cup showing by reaching the quarterfinals, only to lose 4–0 at the hands of GAP Connah&#x27;s Quay.

=== Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C: 2012–present ===
Preceding the 2012 season, the club rebranded to Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C., and immediately showed success by getting back to back champions in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons.

Despite the club starting a 2014–15 campaign in Welsh League Division 1, they were unable to gain a third successive promotion and a chance to play at the top level of Welsh football following a loss of 5–0 to Aberdare Town.

The 2015–16 season began with the Archers as favourites to get promoted and despite being pushed all the way by both Barry and Goytre, promotion was sealed in late April with a 3–0 victory at Taff&#x27;s Well to ensure Capital City representation in the Cymru Premier for the first time since the 2005–06 season.

The 2016–17 campaign picked up just one point from their first 6 matches with a goalless draw away to Cefn Druids. A run of 3 consecutive victories within a week proved the catalyst to not only ensuring survival but qualifying for the end of season Europa League Play-offs with a 6th-place finish. Met faced Carmarthen Town and despite going a goal down early in the second half, a sumptuous lob from Adam Roscrow and an injury time diving header from Charlie Corsby was enough to see the club through to face Bangor City in the final. The dream was shattered when Dean Rittenburg drilled home from 12 yards for the Citizens to give Bangor a 1 – 0 victory and a passport into the Europa League Qualifying round.

On 19 May 2019, Cardiff Met defeated Bala Town F.C. in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for the preliminary round of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, but lost to Progrés Niederkorn in the preliminary round due to the away goals rule. The club will play their home matches in the competition at Cardiff International Sports Stadium.

<doc id="705715" wikidata="Q3182765" url="?curid=705715" title="John Williams (archbishop of York)">
<text>John Williams (22 March 1582 – 25 March 1650) was a Welsh clergyman and political advisor to King James I. He served as Bishop of Lincoln 1621–1641, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal 1621–1625, and Archbishop of York 1641–1646. He was the last bishop to serve as lord chancellor.

==Early life==
John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, and later Archbishop of York, was born in Conwy, Wales, the second son of Edmund Williams and Mary Wynn. At a time when many bishops came from rather humble backgrounds, Williams prided himself on belonging to an &quot;ancient family&quot;. He attended Ruthin School before graduating from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge BA 1601, MA 1605, BD 1613, and DD 1616. He became a fellow in 1603 and was a University Proctor in 1611–12. He entered the clergy and he first impressed the king with a sermon he preached in 1610. He became the king&#x27;s chaplain in 1617.

==Political career==
In 1620 he was made Dean of Westminster and was swiftly elevated by King James I to the Bishopric of Lincoln in 1621, as well as being made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Throughout his political career, Williams was identified as a strong supporter of King James, who, it has been said, valued him as a man &quot;who knew his mind and would do his bidding&quot; and with whom personally he had much in common. He alienated the Prince of Wales, the future Charles I by disapproving of his ill-fated expedition with the Duke of Buckingham to Madrid. When James I died and was succeeded by Charles I in 1625, Williams was quickly removed from the office of Lord Chancellor, and was prevented from attending Parliament. Though Williams managed to survive Buckingham, who was assassinated in 1628, he remained out of favour; he incurred the enmity of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1633 and his powerful ally Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, both of whom had great influence with Charles I.

Williams&#x27;s liberal attitudes toward the Puritans led to a legal battle with the Court of the Star Chamber. Laud&#x27;s biographer refers to the original charge against him, of revealing State secrets, as frivolous; but Williams, in his efforts to clear himself, laid himself open to a charge of subornation of perjury, which was proved, and he was suspended from his benefices in 1636, fined, and imprisoned in the Tower of London until 1640. Laud had assumed that the conviction would force Williams&#x27; resignation as Bishop of Lincoln; but to his fury, Williams refused to resign and no machinery existed to remove him. Until his imprisonment, Williams remained defiantly at his episcopal palace, Buckden, lavishing hospitality on his neighbours.

In 1640 the Lords forced the King to release him, and Williams resumed his offices and tried to steer a course between the extreme wings of the Church. He showed little pity for either Laud or Strafford, supporting the impeachment of both men. In the case of Laud, there is no evidence that he approved of Laud&#x27;s eventual execution; but it was otherwise with Strafford. He fatally weakened Strafford&#x27;s cause in the House of Lords by arguing successfully that the bishops should absent themselves in cases involving the death penalty, and later specifically urged the King not to spare Strafford&#x27;s life, arguing that in his public role he was discharged from his private promise to that effect. He was re-imprisoned by Parliament in 1641, but was released on bail in 1642 and went to be with the King in Yorkshire, as well as be enthroned as Archbishop of York, a position to which he had been appointed the previous year. His stay in Yorkshire was brief, however, and he spent the last years of his life in his native north Wales, initially supporting the royalist cause, but eventually coming to an accommodation with the local parliamentarian commander in 1646. He was deprived of his See by Parliament on 9 October 1646, as episcopacy was abolished for the duration of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate.

==Death and legacy==
Williams died of quinsy in 1650 whilst staying with his kinsfolk, the Wynns of Gwydir, and was buried at the parish church of Llandygai. He had repurchased the family estate, which passed to his nephew Sir Griffith Williams. Through his niece Elizabeth Dolben he was the grand-uncle of a later Archbishop of York, John Dolben.

Details of Williams&#x27; Civil War activities in North Wales are contained in Norman Tucker&#x27;s book &quot;Prelate at Arms&quot; (Llandudno, 1937). He is also the central character in Tucker&#x27;s fictional work &quot;Castle of Care&quot;, (London 1937) as well as playing a significant role in one of Tucker&#x27;s later novels, &quot;Restless we roam&quot; (London 1950).

<text>The Visualize EG is a Hewlett-Packard 2D graphics card used in their Series 700 UNIX workstations.

The Visualize-EG (project name Graffiti) was the basic graphics card in the era of HP&#x27;s older B, C and J class workstations (e.g., the B132). In those, EG was the integrated (on the motherboard) display device, although it was also available in GSC and later PCI card form. EG is a descendant of HP&#x27;s CRX family of graphics devices.

Despite being entry level, and offering no hardware 3D features, EG had excellent 2D performance. Specifications (without optional memory upgrade) are:

* Resolutions up to 1280 × 1024 at 75 Hz.
* 8 planes providing up to 256 simultaneously displayed colours chosen from a true-color palette.
* Two 256-entry hardware colour maps.
* HP Color recovery technology for simulated True Color using only 8 planes.

Optional memory can be used to provide one or the other of these benefits:

# Extra resolution – up to 1600 × 1200 or 1200 × 1600 @ 75 Hz.
# 16 more planes, giving 24 in total: 
16 of these become image planes with the other 8 used as moveable &quot;overlay&quot; planes. Another 2 hardware colormaps become available, providing 2 for the image planes and 2 for the overlay planes.

The EG features an accelerated 2D graphics engine that is capable of:
* BitBLT featuring boolean and arithmetic raster operations at up to 241 million pixels per second.
* Filling – a very fast (up to 2.3 billion pixels per second) hardware fill allows filling of rectangular areas with solid color or stippled pattern. It is also possible to fill with bitmap patterns.
* Vectors – the hardware can produce over 7 million 10-pixel X Window System compliant vectors per second.
* Trapezoids – hardware support for trapezoids means filled polygons can be created at a rate of 106 million pixels per second.
* Window clip and offset – time-consuming clipping and relative co-ordinate translation are provided for in hardware.
* Hardware cursor – a 2-color 64 × 64 pixel &#x27;sprite&#x27; is provided for presenting the cursor.

The programming interface of the EG (and other HP graphics devices) has been kept private to HP, although efforts to release them are underway. The documentation needs to be &quot;scrubbed&quot; to check and remove company confidential material.</text><links>

<text>Darnell Williams (born 3 March 1955) is a British television actor. He is best known for his portrayal of Jesse Hubbard on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1981 to 1988, and from 2008 to 2011, a role which has earned him two Daytime Emmy Awards.

==Personal life==
Williams was born in London, England. In the mid-1970s, he was a regular dancer on TV&#x27;s &quot;Soul Train&quot;. 

==Career==
Williams began portraying Jesse Hubbard on &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1981. His character became involved in a love affair with upper middle class Angie Baxter (Debbi Morgan). The characters eventually married and thus Darnell Williams was one half of the first African American supercouple on an American soap opera. Williams won two Daytime Emmy Awards for his work on &quot;All My Children&quot; in the 1980s. During the mid-1980s, both he and Morgan co-hosted a dance show titled &quot;New York Hot Tracks,&quot; that also featured music videos.

In 1988, Williams left &quot;All My Children&quot;. However, he returned to soap operas in 1994 as Jack Durban on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;; the role lasted until early 1995. Williams then appeared as Jesse Hubbard&#x27;s look-alike Jacob Foster on &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;The City&quot;. He later briefly reprised his role of Jesse on &quot;All My Children&quot;, albeit in angel form, when he welcomed Gillian Andrassy (Esta TerBlanche) into Heaven in 2001.

Williams had a recurring role as the counsellor on the primetime drama &quot;Felicity&quot;, and worked as a director and acting coach for &quot;All My Children&quot;.

In May 2007, Williams joined the cast of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the recurring role of the villainous Griggs, a man who A.C. Mallet was once employed by as a hit-man. He appeared in the play &quot;Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell&quot; in New York City through June 2007. In 2008, Williams, along with Gregori J. Martin, co-directed the independent film &quot;Manhattanites&quot;, starring Ilene Kristen, Forbes March, and Aiden Turner, Williams&#x27;s co-star.

Williams returned to &quot;All My Children&quot; in January 2008 as a very much alive Jesse Hubbard, along with Debbi Morgan, who played Angie Hubbard. He appeared on &quot;Oprah- the Last Season&quot; with cast mates Debbi Morgan and Michael E. Knight in 2011.

In September 2011, Darnell Williams concluded his run on &quot;All My Children&quot; along with the rest of the cast, due to the cancellation of the serial. At the time &quot;All My Children&quot; ended, Williams was the oldest contracted male actor cast member with the show and the second oldest contracted actor after Susan Lucci.

In January 2012, it was confirmed that Williams will be joining the cast of the CBS daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, where he will reunite with &quot;All My Children&quot; co-star Debbi Morgan.

Williams returned in the new internet version of &quot;All My Children&quot;, reprising his role of Jesse Hubbard. The new show premiered on iTunes, Hulu and Hulu Plus on 29 April 2013.

Williams&#x27;s film appearances include &quot;Sidewalk Stories&quot;, &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, and &quot;Simone&quot;.

Williams did not participate in the &quot;All My Children&quot; reunion that was featured on the 2 February 2017 edition of the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; show. However, &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; did utilize footage of Williams as his Jesse Hubbard character from the wedding of Greg Nelson and Jenny Gardner (played by Laurence Lau and Kim Delaney, respectively) on &quot;All My Children&quot;.

<doc id="705735" wikidata="Q1412148" url="?curid=705735" title="XInclude">
<text>XInclude is a generic mechanism for merging XML documents, by writing inclusion tags in the &quot;main&quot; document to automatically include other documents or parts thereof. The resulting document becomes a single composite XML Information Set. The XInclude mechanism can be used to incorporate content from either XML files or non-XML text files.

XInclude is not natively supported in Web browsers, but may be partially achieved by using some extra JavaScript code.

== Example ==
For example, including the text file codice_1:

 This document is published under GNU Free Documentation License

in an XHTML document:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
 xmlns:xi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;xi:include href=&quot;license.txt&quot; parse=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
gives:
 &lt;body&gt;
 This document is published under GNU Free Documentation License
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The mechanism is similar to HTML&#x27;s codice_2 tag (which is specific to the HTML markup language), but the XInclude mechanism works with any XML format, such as SVG and XHTML.

<doc id="705738" wikidata="Q5222467" url="?curid=705738" title="The City (1995 TV series)">
<text>The City is an American television soap opera that aired on ABC from November 13, 1995, to March 28, 1997. The series was a continuation of the serial &quot;Loving&quot;, which ran from 1983 until 1995, and featured the surviving central characters of the latter&#x27;s final major story arc, which saw most of the show&#x27;s characters fall victim to a serial killer. The characters that survived moved from Corinth, Pennsylvania, to New York City and settled in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo.

The show was co-created by Agnes Nixon, the creator of &quot;Loving&quot;, and the show&#x27;s last pair of headwriters, Barbara Esensten and James Harmon Brown. The show won two Daytime Emmy Awards in 1996.

==Storylines==
While it was started by &quot;Loving&quot; creator Agnes Nixon, &quot;The City&quot; was different from other soaps of its day, as the city wasn&#x27;t the main setting of the series: the loft and its surroundings took precedence, and the city was secondary. Also, the show was shot on videotape using the Film look process for its entire run (one of two soap operas ever to do so, &quot;All My Children&quot; also used the FilmLook processing from 2006 to 2010).

One of the most daring storylines was one involving a transsexual. Photographer Bernardo had a one night stand with model Azure C. He went to the corner to get some orange juice when he saw a picture of Azure C. before the sex change operation. The modeling agency which they both worked had to do a lot of damage control. The storyline began to take off but was soon dropped, in part due to the subject matter, protests from transgender rights groups who felt that the storyline presented trans people as a source of mockery, and in part due to lackluster reaction to actress Carlotta Chang&#x27;s performance. Azure and Bernardo reconciled and left town.

Despite featuring several well-known actors, such as Morgan Fairchild and Debbi Morgan, the series failed to catch on. In an attempt to remind viewers of the well-received &quot;Loving Murders&quot; storyline from &quot;Loving&quot;, in mid-1996 the show had most of the characters stalked (and some murdered by) a killer known as The Masquerader who left notes saying &quot;Happy Now&quot;. The killer was revealed to be Danny&#x27;s girlfriend Molly Malone, whose sweet, perky behavior belied her true nature.

Several months later, Lorraine, who had dazzled critics and fans in the final months of &quot;Loving&quot;, joined the show. She had left her long-lost love Charles (Angie&#x27;s ex-husband) and took up with fellow middle-aged alcoholic Nick Rivers. Rivers shared a past with Sydney Chase and there were plans to team the two up (they had palpable chemistry a decade earlier in ABC&#x27;s short-lived prime time soap &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;) but the plans never materialized.

===The end===
Morgan Fairchild had only signed a one-year contract and left when that contract expired in late 1996. ABC replaced her with Jane Elliot, who was very popular as the witchy Tracy Quartermaine on &quot;General Hospital&quot; (Elliot had previously helped produce &quot;Loving&quot; from 1994 to 1995). Four months prior to her arrival, Elliot reprised her role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; for the summer to cross over on &quot;The City&quot; in the fall. However, despite Elliot&#x27;s addition to the show, ratings continued to be the lowest of any daytime soap opera and ABC announced the program&#x27;s cancellation in February 1997.

Two months after the show&#x27;s finale, after airing classic episodes of ABC&#x27;s other soaps (&quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;) in &quot;The City&quot; time slot, ABC would replace the show with &quot;Port Charles&quot;, which remained until October 2003. The show did provide happy endings for most of its characters but when they failed to get Morgan Fairchild to appear again as Sydney Chase, the show killed her off by the &quot;Happy Now&quot; killer. Daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot; used Sydney Chase&#x27;s loft set from &quot;The City&quot; until its fifth season.

==Cast==
The original characters of the show included the survivors of the murder storyline on &quot;Loving&quot;, including Ally Alden (played by Laura Wright), Steffi Brewster (Amelia Heinle), Alex Masters (Randolph Mantooth), Angie Hubbard (Debbi Morgan), Tess Wilder (Catherine Hickland), Buck Huston (Philip Brown), Danny Roberts (Ted King), Jocelyn Roberts (Lisa Lo Cicero), Jacob Foster (Darnell Williams), Frankie Hubbard (Alimi Ballard), Richard Wilkins (Corey Page), and Tony Soleito (George Palermo). Among the original characters there were Zoey (Joni Allen), Nick Rivers (Roscoe Born), Joey Soleito (James Sioutis), Bernard Castro (Philip Anthony-Rodriguez), Sydney Chase (Morgan Fairchild), Azure C (Carlotta Chang), and Molly Malone (Melissa Dye).

Angie Hubbard and her son Frankie were characters that originated in the early 1980s on &quot;All My Children&quot;, and were transplanted to &quot;Loving&quot; in 1993. Thus, with the premiere of &quot;The City&quot; in 1995, Angie and Frankie became the first two individuals who have been regular characters on three ABC soap operas. Likewise, Angie&#x27;s portrayer Debbi Morgan became the first actor to portray the same character as a regular on three different soap operas.

Characters from &quot;Loving&quot;, Cooper Alden (Michael Weatherly) and Deborah Alden (Nancy Addison) made brief appearances at the start of the series. By 1996, several original cast members had already left the series, including Anthony-Rodriguez, Ballard, Chang, Dye, Fairchild, and Heinle. To refresh the cast, and substitute Fairchild&#x27;s departure, the show welcomed Tracy Quartermaine (a &quot;General Hospital&quot; character, played by Jane Elliot) to the show. Other new characters included Dillon Quartermaine (also from &quot;GH&quot;, played by P.J. Aliseo), Jared Chase (Joel Fabiani), Carla Soleito (Amy Van Horne), Gino Soleito (Al Martino, Joseph Sirola) and Lorraine Hawkins (Maggie Rush) who was also on &quot;Loving&quot; towards the end of the show.

==Ratings history==

&quot;The City&quot; fared poorly from the beginning, ranking last out of 11 soaps and averaging a 2.2 rating for the majority of the 1995–96 television season (&quot;Loving&quot; had left the air averaging a 2.5 rating between the months of September and November 1995). The ratings dropped to 2.0 for the 1996–97 television season, and producers tried to gain viewers by crossing over Jane Elliot&#x27;s popular &quot;General Hospital&quot; character Tracy Quartermaine, who first appeared in October 1996. &quot;The City&quot; ranked last out of 11 soap operas on the air as late as the first week of January 1997 even below newcomer &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, but a stronger than expected finale month in March 1997, coupled with a ratings slide for newcomer &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, saved &quot;The City&quot; from last place in the ratings for both of its two seasons on the air. After &quot;The City&quot; aired its final episode, ABC temporarily aired classic 30-minute episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot; in its place. &quot;Port Charles&quot;, which would debut in &quot;The City&quot;&#x27;s timeslot in June 1997, would post a 2.6 rating for 1996–97, and would not fall below &quot;The City&#x27;&quot;s lowest yearly rating until 2000–2001.

<text>Capitol is an American soap opera which aired on CBS from March 29, 1982, to March 20, 1987, for 1,270 episodes. As its name suggests, the storyline usually revolved around the political intrigues of people whose lives are intertwined in Washington, D.C.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Capitol&quot; revolves around the Denning, Clegg, and McCandless families, who live in the fictional Jeffersonia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. At the center of the drama are feuding matriarchs Clarissa Tyler McCandless (Constance Towers) and Myrna Clegg (Carolyn Jones; Marla Adams; Marj Dusay). Kindly and down-to-earth Clarissa and vituperative and vindictive Myrna are former best friends who in their youth had been rivals over the love of Baxter McCandless; in retaliation for Baxter falling for Clarissa and not her, scheming Myrna had spread lies about Clarissa&#x27;s father, liberal Congressman Judson (Rory Calhoun), linking him to communists during the McCarthy era.

Baxter has left Clarissa a widow, and Myrna is married to wealthy industrialist Sam Clegg (Robert Sampson; Richard Egan). The longstanding feud between the women is inflamed when Clarissa&#x27;s war-hero son Tyler McCandless (David Mason Daniels; Dane Witherspoon) falls in love with Myrna&#x27;s daughter, Julie Clegg (Kimberly Beck; Catherine Hickland). Despite Myrna&#x27;s best efforts to destroy this match, they eventually marry. Also featured are Myrna&#x27;s other children: Trey (Nicholas Walker), who is being groomed for the presidency; Brenda (Leslie Graves; Shannon Terhune; Ashley Laurence; Karen Kelly), and Jordy (Todd Curtis, Russell Todd). Despite their mother&#x27;s scheming and conniving, Julie, Jordy and Brenda were not like Myrna whatsoever. Trey, a young congressman, however was ambitious and could be ruthless. He disliked Tyler and considered him to be a rival. Besides Tyler and her father, Judson, Clarissa&#x27;s family includes sons Wally (Bill Beyers), a young man with a gambling problem, Thomas (Brian Robert Taylor; Michael Catlin), a doctor, and Matt (Shea Farrell; Christopher Durham), a handsome athlete. Also living with them for a time was Clarissa&#x27;s niece, Gillian (Kelly Palzis). Meanwhile, Clarissa is in love with Senator Mark Denning (Ed Nelson) who is in an unhappy marriage with agoraphobic Paula (Julie Adams) and is the father of reporter Sloane Denning (Debrah Farentino). Clarissa later falls for Jarrett Morgan (Ron Harper), who turns out to be her presumed-dead husband Baxter.

While the original focus was on the Romeo and Juliet style love story of Tyler and Julie, the bulk of the storyline quickly switched to Trey and Sloane whose 1984 wedding was filmed on location at the Jefferson Memorial. Trey&#x27;s previous relationship with former prostitute Kelly Harper (Jane Daly; Jess Walton) produced a son, Scotty, and eventually caused Trey and Sloane to divorce. Julie and Tyler dealt with constant interference by Myrna as well as Julie&#x27;s inability to have a child. Playboy Jordy had several serious romances, most notably with feisty Lizabeth Bachman (Tonja Walker) and sweet Leanne Foster (Christine Kellogg). &quot;Capitol&quot; was also notable for having a major disabled character, Dr. Thomas McCandless, a successful surgeon in spite of having to walk with the help of crutches. Thomas was paired originally with the flirtatious Lizabeth who loved him in spite of also being attracted to Jordy. Later on, after Trey and Kelly broke up, Thomas became involved with Kelly, which involved him in another triangle with a member of the Clegg family. The Cleggs and McCandlesses became further tied together, to Myrna&#x27;s chagrin, through the romance of Wally and Brenda.

The older characters were busy in storylines as well, most notably Clarissa and Mark who had to deal with the psychotic Paula, who pretended to be agoraphobic as she plotted to murder Clarissa, while Myrna had to struggle with the news that Matt McCandless&#x27;s girlfriend, Amy Burke, was Sam&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. Lana Wood, Natalie Wood&#x27;s younger sister, was cast in the part, but the storyline was dropped after a little more than six months. The older character&#x27;s pasts were explored more deeply when the wheelchair-using Jared Morgan was revealed to be Clarissa&#x27;s supposedly deceased husband, Baxter. The performances of the older actors were honored with several Soap Opera Digest Nominations, but none of the cast were ever Emmy Nominated. Primetime TV veteran Marj Dusay took over the role of Myrna in April 1983 when Carolyn Jones became too ill to continue and her temporary substitute, Marla Adams, joined &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Dusay was credited for helping to flesh out the character of the scheming Myrna to make her more multi-dimensional and would remain on the show through the remainder of the run.

The casting of Jess Walton as Kelly Harper was also critically praised as the extremely complex Sloane returned to her old scheming nature in order to keep her marriage to Trey on solid ground. Veteran character actor Arthur Malet was cast as Kelly&#x27;s older friend who had taken her in while she was pregnant with Scotty, and later on, Lola Falana was cast as an artist&#x27;s representative who took an interest in Kelly&#x27;s painting and aided her in pursuing a career as an artist. This storyline also cast &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; veteran Lara Parker as a distinguished gallery owner, but unfortunately, Falana&#x27;s storyline was never developed beyond the hint of a mysterious past. With Washington D.C. having a large black population, soap critics complained that &quot;Capitol&quot; writers were not taking advantage of this fact to tell important stories, and Falana lasted less than a year.

In 1983, Zed Diamond, portrayed by Bradley Lockerman, arrived in Washington. Diamond was a wealthy man of mystery. He was handsome and articulate but little was known about his past except rumors. He owned the successful restaurant Mario&#x27;s, which the rich and powerful frequented. He also owned a local television station. He was polite and gracious to the patrons of his restaurant. But he could be dark and a deadly man of action when sufficiently provoked. He disliked Trey Clegg, whom he considered to be a gutless backstabber. He had no love for Myrna and Sam Clegg whom had mistreated his late mother. Zed&#x27;s mother had been a maid at the Clegg mansion many years prior. The Clegg&#x27;s had fired his mother, whom they wrongfully accused of stealing from them. This destroyed his mother&#x27;s reputation making it impossible for her to find work. He was kind to Julie Clegg McCandless, whom he liked. He would have an affair with Sloane Denning Clegg. Sloane slept with Diamond for revenge when she discovered the long-term relationship between Trey and Kelly, that Trey had never mentioned prior to their marriage. Zed was also involved in storylines concerning his mysterious past which involved his relationship with the head of a powerful crime family and that man&#x27;s daughter Jenny.

The re-casting of Julie Clegg McCandless with Catherine Hickland was a plus, especially when the mysterious Zed Diamond appeared on the scene, shocked by her resemblance to his late wife, Jenny. Eventually, the character of Jenny was revealed to be alive, also played by Hickland, and gave her the opportunity to show off her chops playing a dangerous character, Jenny being revealed to have major psychological problems. When Jenny and Zed&#x27;s storyline took off, Julie faded into the background, having gone off to find husband Tyler who was revealed to be involved in an off-screen affair. After Jenny&#x27;s demise, Hickland remained off screen for several months, only returning as Julie, who had left Tyler, for the last few months of the show with basically no storyline of her own. Although a relationship between Julie and Zed Diamond was just beginning when the show was cancelled. Hickland would go on to several other soaps playing a variety of schemers as would Jess Walton, Constance Towers and Marj Dusay. At one point, Hickland, Towers and Dusay were dominating all of the ABC soaps as villainesses of very nefarious natures while Walton found great success on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; by taking over the role of Jill Foster.

As with other soap operas in the mid-1980s, &quot;Capitol&quot; tried its hand with adventure storylines, pairing Sloane with Prince Ali (Peter Lochran), the potential King of Baraq, a fictional Islamic nation undergoing political strife. Much of the action took place outside the United States and while it paralleled much of what was going on in the real world, audiences began to drift away. Soap Opera Digest praised the Sloane and Ali pairing, naming their romantic moments as the best love scenes of 1986. In spite of that praise, the show was criticized for taking its storyline twists to bizarre extremes. Within short periods of time, Sam Clegg was revealed to have fathered Scotty, not Trey, and Mark Denning was revealed to be a traitor. This infuriated veteran actor Ed Nelson so much that he quit in disgust. Rory Calhoun had also departed the show, although he did sign a new contract shortly before the cancellation announcement, reappearing around the same time as Catherine Hickland.

The last weeks of the show focused on Sloane&#x27;s taking over as Queen of Baracq (Ali was presumed dead) and her efforts to hide from his enemies. Several new characters were introduced, the most memorable being Laureen Clegg (Janis Paige), Sam&#x27;s first wife and Trey&#x27;s real mother, who kept her identity secret and became Scotty&#x27;s nanny. Sam, having become involved in an affair with the much younger Kate Wells (Cheryl Ann Wilson), found himself the victim of blackmail after breaking off with Kate as she had discovered the truth about Scotty&#x27;s paternity. This led the show to present two cliff-hangers, Myrna&#x27;s vowing of war after Sam at Kate&#x27;s demand demanded a divorce, and Sloane&#x27;s standing in front of a firing squad.

==Production==
CBS asked &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; producer John Conboy to produce an equivalent in daytime during the summer of 1981 to compete with the more youth-oriented ABC soap operas such as &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. &quot;Capitol&quot; became the first soap opera to be produced in Los Angeles since &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; had begun in 1973. &quot;Capitol&quot; premiered on March 29, 1982 on CBS, replacing &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; in the 2:30 pm (ET)/1:30 (CT/MT/PT) timeslot. After that show&#x27;s producers, Procter &amp; Gamble was rebuffed by CBS to move their show back to its former timeslot, 12:30 pm/11:30 am and with its contract with the network expiring, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; moved to NBC the same day &quot;Capitol&quot; launched, and continued there until it was canceled near the end of 1986.

The show&#x27;s title sequence during its early years showed aerial scenes of Washington, D.C. shot during the winter of 1980–81. In the final year, a computerized sequence was instituted, illustrating glamour and sex in addition to the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial.

===Cancellation===
During most of its run, the show had steady ratings and held on in the middle of the pack among the soaps. The storylines that were resolved beginning in the 1985–86 season, however, caused a rather steep fall in ratings. Not only was Scotty Harper revealed to have been fathered by Sam Clegg, Senator Mark Denning turned out to be a spy. Sloane was paired with an Arab prince, Prince Ali (Peter Lochran), which gave the opportunity for some exotic love scenes. With Clarissa not sure if the man she thought was Baxter was really her long presumed dead husband, the show veered further off track by revealing that Clarissa and Baxter&#x27;s son, Matt, was really Prince Ali&#x27;s long-lost brother, adopted by Baxter to prevent him from being killed. However, the addition of film and stage actress Janis Paige as Sam&#x27;s long gone first wife Laureen was filled with potential that never got the chance to be explored.

By early summer 1986, CBS had lost faith in &quot;Capitol&quot; and, needing a replacement, then-head of CBS Daytime, Michael Brockman requested proposals from industry writers and producers. Veteran producer Paul Rauch responded with an idea for a more satirical serial called &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; about a wealthy and dysfunctional blue blood family from Grosse Pointe, while &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; co-creator Claire Labine&#x27;s proposed drama was titled &quot;Celebration&quot; that would revolve around a middle-class family in the suburbs of Cleveland that would be produced by Procter &amp; Gamble. Her family-driven concept and traditional approach lacked the overt glamour of &quot;Capitol&quot; and fell more along the lines of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; or &quot;Another World&quot;, but would include a modern 80s twist to keep the show current. Ultimately, however, neither Rauch&#x27;s nor Labine&#x27;s concepts would make it to the air.

That December, CBS announced that &quot;Capitol&quot; would be cancelled, with its final episode airing on March 20, 1987. Premiering in its place would be Bill and Lee Phillip Bell&#x27;s new production, a sister show to their popular &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; called &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Accommodating the successor soap opera&#x27;s launch meant accelerating production on &quot;Capitol&quot; remaining episodes, so the last two months&#x27; shows were taped in the span of a month. Conboy and head writer James Lipton brought the soap&#x27;s saga to a loose ending with a cliffhanger series finale which left Sam being blackmailed by his lover Kate into asking Myrna for a divorce, and Sloane placed in front of a firing squad in the Middle Eastern kingdom of her lover, King Ali. &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; debuted three days after the finale, on March 23, 1987, and has remained in the former &quot;Capitol&quot; timeslot ever since; it would prove more popular than its timeslot predecessor, going on to place near the top of the soap ratings (much of the time behind only &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;) for much of its existence to date.

==Cast==

During its run, &quot;Capitol&quot; featured several well-known veteran actors of the stage and screen in contract roles, including Richard Egan, Carolyn Jones, Rory Calhoun, Constance Towers and Julie Adams. In the show&#x27;s earlier years, singer Lola Falana played wealthy entertainment mogul Charity Blake, and Natalie Wood&#x27;s sister Lana Wood played Fran Burke. In 1986, country music singer Tammy Wynette made appearances as hairstylist-turned-singer Darlene Stankowski. Stage veteran and Oscar nominee Beah Richards had a short term role around the same time. In the show&#x27;s last month, Broadway and movie veteran Janis Paige played Sam&#x27;s first wife, Laureen, who was Trey&#x27;s mother.

==Scheduling/ratings==

On June 8, 1981, CBS moved &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, daytime television&#x27;s longest-tenured soap and a fixture for nearly 30 years at 12:30 PM/11:30 AM Central, to the 2:30/1:30 PM timeslot between &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in order to accommodate the hit serial &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Procter &amp; Gamble, who owned &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, urged CBS to return the show to its former slot. The network refused, and when their contract with CBS expired, P&amp;G sold &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; to NBC Daytime and the show premiered there on March 29, 1982. CBS replaced &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; with &quot;Capitol&quot; in its timeslot, scheduled against the last halves of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live,&quot; the latter of which dominated the ratings at the time.

&quot;Capitol&quot; debuted on CBS in 1982 in 8th place in the ratings, roughly the same as &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; had done. &quot;Capitol&quot; remained in the middle of the ratings pack throughout its five-year run ranking between 7th and 9th, with its best ratings points of 6.4 achieved in the 1983-1984 television season, in which it ranked 8th. In 1985, ratings fell slightly from a 5.8 to a 5.1, prompting some CBS affiliates to drop the show. CBS subsequently canceled the show and replaced it with &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; on March 23, 1987. However, CBS put &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in the 1:30/12:30 timeslot, bumping &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to 2/1. &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; became both CBS&#x27; and America&#x27;s second-highest rated soap opera, but its ratings never surpassed &quot;Capitol&quot; ratings peak.

<text>Robin Christopher (born June 18, 1965) is an American actress. She is known for her role as Skye Chandler Quartermaine on the ABC soap operas &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Early life==
Christopher was born in Revere, Massachusetts. She turned down a fine arts scholarship to Boston University to pursue an acting career. Until her acting career took off, she supported herself working as a model and appeared on Romance novel covers.

==Career==
Christopher is the only actor to have played the same character (Skye Chandler) as a regular cast member on all three of ABC&#x27;s soap operas: &quot;All My Children&quot; (1987–91, 2000), &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1999–2001) and &quot;General Hospital&quot; (2001–08, 2010–12). She earned two nominations for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2005. Christopher portrayed Lorna Devon on &quot;Another World&quot; (1994–97). In both roles, on two different networks, Christopher&#x27;s biological mother was portrayed by soap opera star Linda Dano, who played Skye&#x27;s mother, Rae Cummings, on &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;Port Charles&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and Lorna&#x27;s mother, Felicia Gallant, on &quot;Another World&quot;.

When Christopher began playing Skye Chandler, the character was known as Skye Patterson. Over the years, the character married, divorced, remarried, redivorced, and believed on two occasions to have discovered and grown closer to her biological family, the Chandlers on &quot;All My Children&quot; and Quartermaines on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, only to discover her biological origins to be far murkier than originally realized.

In accord with Skye&#x27;s nomadic journey through the ABC soaps and ultimate independence, Robin Christopher has often been referred to by fans as the &#x27;Greta Garbo of soap opera&#x27;, evoking in her performance the glamour and emotional depth of Classical Hollywood cinema.

In 1993, Christopher guest starred in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s first season, &quot;Duet&quot; and &quot;In the Hands of the Prophets&quot;, as the Bajoran engineer Neela.

==Personal life==
Christopher has been married to her former &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Matt Crane since 2000 and they have two children together.

<text>Mike Larrabee (&quot;Michael Denny Larrabee;&quot; December 2, 1933 – April 22, 2003) was an American athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

Born in Hollywood, California and raised in Ventura, Larrabee was a young running talent in the mid-1950s. In 1952, his athletic performances earned him a scholarship at the University of Southern California, from which he graduated as a geology major. A series of injuries hampered his running career, causing him to miss out on the 1956 and 1960 Olympics, but he had his best season in 1964.

He won his only AAU title in 400 m, then he won the 400 m (tying the world record of 44.9 seconds) at the 1964 Olympic Trials in Los Angeles. In the Tokyo Olympics final, Larrabee was in fifth place going into the final turn, then passed everyone in front of him with a burst of speed to win the gold medal in 45.1. Larrabee also ran the second leg on United States gold medal winning 4 × 400 m relay team that won in the world record time of 3:00.7.

After the Tokyo Olympics Larrabee worked as a mathematics teacher at James Monroe High School, ran a beverage distributing company with his brother and worked part-time as Adidas’ U.S. shoe representative to track and field, a position that allowed him to travel and keep connected to the sport.

Larrabee remained physically active well after his running career had wound down, taking up tennis, scuba diving, skiing, hiking (for which he raised llamas as pack animals) and mountain climbing.
Although he was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer in 2001 and was only expected to live a few weeks, he continued to live life to the fullest for two more years, thanks to chemotherapy treatments. Mike Larrabee died in his home at Santa Maria, California, aged 69. He was posthumously added to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in December 2003.

The stadium at Ventura High School, which he attended, is named for him.

<doc id="705748" wikidata="Q754381" url="?curid=705748" title="WS-ReliableMessaging">
<text>WS-ReliableMessaging describes a protocol that allows SOAP messages to be reliably delivered between distributed applications in the presence of software component, system, or network failures.

The original specification was written by BEA Systems, Microsoft, IBM, and Tibco and in March, 2003 and subsequently refined over the next two years. The February, 2005 version was submitted to the OASIS Web Services Reliable Exchange (WS-RX) Technical Committee in June of that year. The resulting WS-ReliableMessaging 1.1 was approved as an OASIS Standard on June 14, 2007, and v1.2 was approved on February 2, 2009.

Prior to WS-ReliableMessaging, OASIS produced a competing standard (WS-Reliability) that was supported by a coalition of vendors; namely Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Oracle Corporation, Progress Software, and Sun Microsystems. Most of these vendors now also support the WS-ReliableMessaging specification.

==Reliable Messaging Model==

An Application Source (AS) wishes to reliably send messages to an Application Destination (AD) over an unreliable infrastructure. To accomplish this, they make use of a Reliable Messaging Source (RMS) and a Reliable Messaging Destination (RMD). The AS sends a message to the RMS. The RMS uses the WS-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) protocol to transmit the message to the RMD. The RMD delivers the message to the AD. If the RMS cannot transmit the message to the RMD for some reason, it must raise an exception or otherwise indicate to the AS that the message was not transmitted. The AS and RMS may be implemented within the same process space or they may be separate components. Similarly, the AD and RMD may exist within the same process space or they may be separate components.

The important thing to keep in mind is that the WS-RM specification only deals with the contents and behavior of messages as they appear &quot;on the wire&quot;. How messages are sent from the AS to the RMS, how they are delivered from the RMD to the AD, whether messages are persisted on-disk or held in memory, etc.; none of these considerations are part of the WS-RM specification.

The WS-RM protocol defines and supports a number of Delivery Assurances. These are:
;AtLeastOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD at least once. If a message cannot be delivered, an error must be raised by the RMS and/or the RMD. Messages may be delivered to the AD more than once (i.e. the AD may get duplicate messages).
;AtMostOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD at most once. Messages might not be delivered to the AD, but the AD will never get duplicate messages.
;ExactlyOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD exactly once. If a message cannot be delivered, an error must be raised by the RMS and/or the RMD. The AD will never get duplicate messages.
;InOrder: Messages will be delivered from the RMD to the AD in the order that they are sent from the AS to the RMS. This assurance can be combined with any of the above assurances.

==Composable Architecture==
WS-ReliableMessaging uses the extensibility model of SOAP and WSDL. WS-ReliableMessaging does not define all the features required for a complete messaging solution. WS-ReliableMessaging is a building block that is used in conjunction with other Web Services specifications and application-specific protocols to build a complete messaging solution.

==Criticism==
This article attempts to make the case that reliability is not needed at the message level, but required at the business level.

<doc id="705749" wikidata="Q6056721" url="?curid=705749" title="Intersection homology">
<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, intersection homology is an analogue of singular homology especially well-suited for the study of singular spaces, discovered by Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson in the fall of 1974 and developed by them over the next few years.

Intersection cohomology was used to prove the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures and the Riemann–Hilbert correspondence. It is closely related to &quot;L&quot;2 cohomology.

==Goresky–MacPherson approach==
The homology groups of a compact, oriented, connected, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;X&quot; have a fundamental property called Poincaré duality: there is a perfect pairing

:formula_1

Classically—going back, for instance, to Henri Poincaré—this duality was understood in terms of intersection theory. An element of

:formula_2

is represented by a &quot;j&quot;-dimensional cycle. If an &quot;i&quot;-dimensional and an formula_3-dimensional cycle are in general position, then their intersection is a finite collection of points. Using the orientation of &quot;X&quot; one may assign to each of these points a sign; in other words intersection yields a &quot;0&quot;-dimensional cycle. One may prove that the homology class of this cycle depends only on the homology classes of the original &quot;i&quot;- and formula_3-dimensional cycles; one may furthermore prove that this pairing is perfect.

When &quot;X&quot; has &quot;singularities&quot;—that is, when the space has places that do not look like formula_5—these ideas break down. For example, it is no longer possible to make sense of the notion of &quot;general position&quot; for cycles. Goresky and MacPherson introduced a class of &quot;allowable&quot; cycles for which general position does make sense. They introduced an equivalence relation for allowable cycles (where only &quot;allowable boundaries&quot; are equivalent to zero), and called the group

:formula_6

of &quot;i&quot;-dimensional allowable cycles modulo this equivalence relation &quot;intersection homology&quot;. They furthermore showed that the intersection of an &quot;i&quot;- and an formula_3-dimensional allowable cycle gives an (ordinary) zero-cycle whose homology class is well-defined.

===Stratifications===
Intersection homology was originally defined on suitable spaces with a stratification, though the groups often turn out to be independent of the choice of stratification. There are many different definitions of stratified spaces. A convenient one for intersection homology is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional topological pseudomanifold. This is a (paracompact, Hausdorff) space &quot;X&quot; that has a filtration

:formula_8

of &quot;X&quot; by closed subspaces such that:

*For each &quot;i&quot; and for each point &quot;x&quot; of formula_9, there exists a neighborhood formula_10 of &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, a compact formula_11-dimensional stratified space &quot;L&quot;, and a filtration-preserving homeomorphism formula_12. Here formula_13 is the open cone on &quot;L&quot;.
*formula_14.
*formula_15 is dense in &quot;X&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; is a topological pseudomanifold, the &quot;i&quot;-dimensional stratum of &quot;X&quot; is the space formula_9.

Examples:
*If &quot;X&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplicial complex such that every simplex is contained in an &quot;n&quot;-simplex and &quot;n&quot;−1 simplex is contained in exactly two &quot;n&quot;-simplexes, then the underlying space of &quot;X&quot; is a topological pseudomanifold.
*If &quot;X&quot; is any complex quasi-projective variety (possibly with singularities) then its underlying space is a topological pseudomanifold, with all strata of even dimension.

===Perversities===
Intersection homology groups formula_17 depend on a choice of perversity formula_18, which measures how far cycles are allowed to deviate from transversality. (The origin of the name &quot;perversity&quot; was explained by .) A perversity formula_18 is a function
:formula_20
from integers formula_21 to the integers such that
*formula_22.
*formula_23.

The second condition is used to show invariance of intersection homology groups under change of stratification.

The complementary perversity formula_24 of formula_18 is the one with

:formula_26.

Intersection homology groups of complementary dimension and complementary perversity are dually paired.

==== Examples of perversities ====
*The minimal perversity has formula_27. Its complement is the maximal perversity with formula_28.
*The (lower) middle perversity &quot;m&quot; is defined by formula_29, the integer part of formula_30. Its complement is the upper middle perversity, with values formula_31. If the perversity is not specified, then one usually means the lower middle perversity. If a space can be stratified with all strata of even dimension (for example, any complex variety) then the intersection homology groups are independent of the values of the perversity on odd integers, so the upper and lower middle perversities are equivalent.

===Singular intersection homology===
Fix a topological pseudomanifold &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; with some stratification, and a perversity &quot;p&quot;.

A map σ from the standard &quot;i&quot;-simplex formula_32 to &quot;X&quot; (a singular simplex) is called allowable if

:formula_33

is contained in the formula_34 skeleton of formula_32.

The chain complex formula_36 is a subcomplex of the complex of singular chains on &quot;X&quot; that consists of all singular chains such that both the chain and its boundary are linear combinations of allowable singular simplexes. The singular intersection homology groups (with perversity &quot;p&quot;)
:formula_37
are the homology groups of this complex.

If &quot;X&quot; has a triangulation compatible with the stratification, then simplicial intersection homology groups can be defined in a similar way, and are naturally isomorphic to the singular intersection homology groups.

The intersection homology groups are independent of the choice of stratification of &quot;X&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; is a topological manifold, then the intersection homology groups (for any perversity) are the same as the usual homology groups.

==Small resolutions==
A resolution of singularities
:formula_38
of a complex variety &quot;Y&quot; is called a small resolution if for every &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, the space of points of &quot;Y&quot; where the fiber has dimension &quot;r&quot; is of codimension greater than 2&quot;r&quot;. Roughly speaking, this means that most fibers are small. In this case the morphism induces an isomorphism from the (intersection) homology of &quot;X&quot; to the intersection homology of &quot;Y&quot; (with the middle perversity).

There is a variety with two different small resolutions that have different ring structures on their cohomology, showing that there is in general no natural ring structure on intersection (co)homology.

==Sheaf theory==
Deligne&#x27;s formula for intersection cohomology states that
:formula_39
where formula_40 is the intersection complex, a certain complex of constructible sheaves on &quot;X&quot; (considered as an element of the derived category, so the cohomology on the right means the hypercohomology of the complex). The complex formula_40 is given by starting with the constant sheaf on the open set formula_42 and repeatedly extending it to larger open sets formula_43 and then truncating it in the derived category; more precisely it is given by Deligne&#x27;s formula
:formula_44
where formula_45 is a truncation functor in the derived category, formula_46 is the inclusion of formula_43 into formula_48, and formula_49 is the constant sheaf on formula_42.

By replacing the constant sheaf on formula_42 with a local system, one can use Deligne&#x27;s formula to define intersection cohomology with coefficients in a local system.

=== Examples ===
Given a smooth elliptic curve formula_52 defined by a cubic homogeneous polynomial formula_53, such as formula_54, the affine cone formula_55 has an isolated singularity at the origin since formula_56 and all partial derivatives formula_57 vanish. This is because it is homogeneous of degree formula_58, and the derivatives are homogeneous of degree 2. Setting formula_59 and formula_60 the inclusion map, the intersection complex formula_61 is given asformula_62
This can be computed explicitly by looking at the stalks of the cohomology. At formula_63 where formula_64 the derived pushforward is the identity map on a smooth point, hence the only possible cohomology is concentrated in degree formula_65. For formula_66 the cohomology is more interesting since
formula_67
for formula_68 where the closure of formula_69 contains the origin formula_70. Since any such formula_68 can be refined by considering the intersection of an open disk in formula_72 with formula_73, we can just compute the cohomology formula_74. This can be done by observing formula_73 is a formula_76 bundle over the elliptic curve formula_77, the hyperplane bundle, and the Wang sequence gives the cohomology groupsformula_78hence the cohomology sheaves at the stalk formula_70 areformula_80
Truncating this gives the nontrivial cohomology sheaves formula_81, hence the intersection complex formula_61 has cohomology sheaves
formula_83

==Properties of the complex IC(&quot;X&quot;)==
The complex IC&quot;p&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) has the following properties
*On the complement of some closed set of codimension 2, we have
:formula_84 is 0 for &quot;i&quot; + &quot;m&quot; ≠ 0, and for &quot;i&quot; = −&quot;m&quot; the groups form the constant local system C
*formula_84 is 0 for &quot;i&quot; + &quot;m&quot; &lt; 0
*If &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 then formula_86 is zero except on a set of codimension at least &quot;a&quot; for the smallest &quot;a&quot; with &quot;p&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≥ &quot;m&quot; − &quot;i&quot;
*If &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 then formula_87 is zero except on a set of codimension at least &quot;a&quot; for the smallest &quot;a&quot; with &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) ≥ (&quot;i&quot;)

As usual, &quot;q&quot; is the complementary perversity to &quot;p&quot;. Moreover, the complex is uniquely characterized by these conditions, up to isomorphism in the derived category. The conditions do not depend on the choice of stratification, so this shows that intersection cohomology does not depend on the choice of stratification either.

Verdier duality takes IC&quot;p&quot; to IC&quot;q&quot; shifted by &quot;n&quot; = dim(&quot;X&quot;) in the derived category.

<text>Chynna Gilliam Phillips (born February 12, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She is a member of the vocal trio Wilson Phillips and is the daughter of the Mamas &amp; the Papas band members John and Michelle Phillips and half-sister of Mackenzie and Bijou Phillips.

== Early life and film work ==
Born in Los Angeles, Phillips began her career in acting. She appeared in films such as &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, &quot;Say Anything&quot; and as the title character Roxanne Pulitzer in the 1989 television biographical film, &quot;Roxanne: The Prize Pulitzer&quot;. In 1995, she appeared as Kim MacAfee in the television film &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. Phillips voiced the character of Kitty along with her husband William Baldwin as Johnny 13 in &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;.

In 2011, Phillips was a contestant on the thirteenth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Her professional partner was two-time finalist Tony Dovolani.

== Music career ==
In 1989, Phillips formed the trio Wilson Phillips with her childhood friends Carnie and Wendy Wilson. The group released their self-titled debut album in 1990. The album would go on to sell eight million copies. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;, released in 1992, was a commercial disappointment, despite being certified platinum.

In 1995, Phillips released her debut solo album, &quot;Naked and Sacred&quot;, but failed to recapture the success she found with Wilson Phillips. In 2004, Wilson Phillips reunited to record their third album, &quot;California&quot;, which featured cover tunes from West Coast singers from the 1960s/70s.

In the October 15, 2007, issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine, she was said to be writing songs for a Christian album. She appeared in brother-in-law Stephen Baldwin&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Livin It: Unusual Suspects&quot;. In 2009, Phillips teamed up with singer/songwriter Vaughan Penn to form the duo &quot;Chynna and Vaughan&quot;. The two released their debut album, &quot;One Reason&quot;, on September 22, 2009. Wilson Phillips released &quot;Christmas In Harmony&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Dedicated&quot; in 2012. , they continue to play shows every year.

In July 2016, Wilson Phillips reunited and performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Phillips had a drug and alcohol addiction as a teenager.

Phillips met actor William Baldwin of the acting Baldwin family in 1991 and has been married to him since 1995. Together, they have three children, daughters Jameson (b. 2000) and Brooke (b. 2004) and son Vance (b. 2001).

In September 2009 Chynna&#x27;s half-sister, Mackenzie Phillips, alleged in her memoirs that she [Mackenzie] and her father had engaged in a ten-year incestuous relationship. While both Geneviève Waïte (John&#x27;s wife at the time, and mother of Bijou Phillips) and Michelle Phillips (John&#x27;s second wife, and mother of Chynna Phillips) told the media that they did not believe her claims, Chynna said she believed Mackenzie.

On February 12, 2010, Phillips was treated for anxiety. In a statement made on February 27, her manager Lizzie Grubman said, &quot;After successfully completing her in-patient treatment for anxiety, Chynna Phillips has happily returned home to celebrate her daughter&#x27;s birthday with her family.&quot; Grubman said Phillips was &quot;happy to be home with her family. She is in great spirits.&quot;

In October 2019, Phillips revealed that her son Vance had been diagnosed with cancer the year prior and was now in remission.

Phillips is a Christian.

<text>The Mask of Zorro is a 1998 American Western swashbuckler film based on the fictional character Zorro by Johnston McCulley. It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. The film features the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins), escaping from prison to find his long-lost daughter (Zeta-Jones) and avenge the death of his wife at the hands of the corrupt governor Rafael Montero (Wilson). He is aided by his successor (Banderas), who is pursuing his own vendetta against the governor&#x27;s right-hand man while falling in love with de la Vega&#x27;s daughter.

Executive producer Steven Spielberg had initially developed the film for TriStar Pictures with directors Mikael Salomon and Robert Rodriguez, before Campbell signed on in 1996. Salomon cast Sean Connery as Don Diego de la Vega, while Rodriguez brought Banderas in the lead role. Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins, and &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; began filming in January 1997 at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico.

The film was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 to critical and commercial success, grossing $250 million on a $95 million budget. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

&quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot;, a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta-Jones and directed by Campbell, was released in 2005, but did not fare as well as its predecessor.

==Plot==
In 1821, masked swordsman Zorro defends the commoners of Las Californias from Spain&#x27;s soldiers. Don Rafael Montero, Las Californias&#x27; corrupt governor, sets a trap for Zorro at the public execution of three peasants. Zorro stops the execution, and Montero&#x27;s soldiers are thwarted by two young brothers, Alejandro and Joaquín Murrieta. Zorro fights the remaining soldiers and thanks the brothers by giving Joaquín a medallion. 

Don Montero deduces Spanish-born nobleman Don Diego de la Vega is Zorro and attempts to arrest him at his home. A swordfight begins, a fire breaks out, and de la Vega&#x27;s wife Esperanza, whom Montero covets, is murdered in the process. While the building burns, Montero takes Diego&#x27;s infant daughter, Elena, as his own before sending de la Vega to prison and returning to Spain.

In 1841, Alejandro and Joaquín are bandits, running a scam to collect the bounty on their heads and steal a strongbox. They, however, fail and are caught by Captain Harrison Love, Montero&#x27;s new American right-hand man. Alejandro escapes, while Joaquín shoots himself to avoid execution by Captain Love. Meanwhile, Montero returns to California with the now adult Elena. Because of Montero, Elena believes her mother died in childbirth. 

Montero&#x27;s reappearance motivates de la Vega to escape captivity. He encounters a drunk Alejandro and recognizes the medallion he gave his brother. He agrees to make Alejandro his protégé in order for them to take revenge on their respective enemies, Montero and Love. Alejandro agrees to undergo de la Vega&#x27;s intense training in Zorro&#x27;s secret lair underneath the ruins of his family estate. In addition, Alejandro seeks to succeed de la Vega as Zorro. 

While still being trained, Alejandro steals a stallion resembling Zorro&#x27;s steed Tornado from the local garrison, masked like &quot;Zorro&quot; and barely escaping. De la Vega scolds Alejandro, asserting that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero&#x27;s trust instead. 

Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y García, with de la Vega as his servant &quot;Bernardo&quot;, and attends a party at Montero&#x27;s hacienda. There, he earns Elena&#x27;s admiration and enough of Montero&#x27;s trust to be invited to a secret meeting between noblemen. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons and proclaim it as an independent republic by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money for the upcoming Mexican–American War.

Montero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to a secret gold mine where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor. He plans to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from his own land. While walking in a market, Elena meets the woman who was her nanny. She tells Elena her parents&#x27; real identity. 

De la Vega sends Alejandro, now Zorro, to steal Montero&#x27;s map leading to the gold mine. Zorro duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When he escapes, Elena chases him, attempting to retrieve Montero&#x27;s map. After a sword duel, Zorro kisses her and flees.

Fearing Santa Anna&#x27;s retribution, Montero decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers to leave no witnesses. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so he can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego&#x27;s vendetta. De la Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, before Montero captures him. 

While being taken away, de la Vega tells Elena the name of the flowers she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases de la Vega from his cell. They proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and de la Vega duel and slay Love and Montero respectively. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off and find the mortally wounded de la Vega. Before dying, he makes peace with the pair and gives his blessings for Alejandro to continue as Zorro and be with Elena.

Sometime later, Alejandro and Elena are married with an infant son &quot;Joaquín&quot;, to whom Alejandro tells of the deeds of Zorro.

==Cast==

* Antonio Banderas as Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro:Banderas was paid $5 million for the role. The character of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real-life Joaquin Murrieta, making the character either Mexican or Chilean. To prepare for his role, Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months, before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico, spending 10 hours a day for two months specifically on fight scenes from the film. &quot;We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, he was such a perfectionist,&quot; director Martin Campbell reflected. &quot;He was incredibly inventive, and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars. They would complain about the intensity of the training, but having worked with him there&#x27;s nobody I&#x27;d rather use.&quot; During interviews for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Anderson rated Banderas the best natural talent he had worked with. Before Banderas was chosen for the role, Benicio Del Toro, Andy García, Marc Anthony, Joaquim de Almeida, and Chayanne were considered.
** José María de Tavira portrays a young Alejandro Murrieta.
* Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro:Hopkins was cast in December 1996, one month before filming began. Hopkins, known for his dramatic acting, took up the role because of his enthusiasm to be in an action film. For the role of Diego de la Vega, actors Sean Connery and Raúl Juliá, who died before he could take the role, were also considered.
* Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena Montero:The actress signed on in November 1996, when Spielberg saw her performance in the &quot;Titanic&quot; miniseries and recommended her to Campbell. Despite being a Welsh actress portraying a Spanish character, Zeta-Jones discovered similarities between her &quot;volatile&quot; Celtic temper and the Latin temperament of Eléna. Izabella Scorupco, who worked with Campbell on &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Judith Godrèche, Salma Hayek, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez screen tested for the part. Zeta-Jones credits &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; as her breakthrough in entering A-list recognition.
** María and Mónica Fernández Cruz portray Elena de la Vega (infant).
* Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero:Armand Assante had initially been cast in the role, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Stuart Wilson, who Campbell previously directed in &quot;No Escape&quot;, was cast in Assante&#x27;s place four months after. Actors Sam Shepard, Lance Henriksen, Edward James Olmos, Scott Glenn and Giancarlo Giannini were also considered for the role.
* Matt Letscher as Captain Harrison Love
* Tony Amendola as Don Luiz
* Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as Don Pedro
* Victor Rivers as Joaquin Murrieta
** Diego Sieres as young Joaquín
* L. Q. Jones as Three-Fingered Jack: Alejandro and Joaquin&#x27;s partner, captured and later killed by Harrison Love at the mine.
* Julieta Rosen as Esperanza De La Vega: Don Diego&#x27;s beloved wife and Elena&#x27;s mother
Other actors in the film include William Marquez as Fray Felipe, Maury Chaykin as a prison warden, Jose Perez as the bumbling Corporal Garcia (a character originating in the 1950s American TV series), Humberto Elizondo as Don Julio, Fernando Becerril as Don Sergio, and Vanessa Bauche as an Indio girl. Joaquim de Almeida filmed scenes as Antonio López de Santa Anna, but his role was cut from the final film.

== Production ==

===Development===

In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment were planning to start production on &quot;Zorro&quot; the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. At the time, Spielberg was producing &quot;Zorro&quot; with the potential to direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated that the rest of the major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. The first chosen for the role of Zorro in his young version was Andy García, a fashionable Latin actor at the time. The role of Zorro was offered to Tom Cruise, but he declined as he felt it wasn&#x27;t a good idea. Colombian singer Shakira was also initially considered to play Elena but turned it down due to her limited acting experience (despite having co-starred in the Colombian TV series &quot;El Oasis&quot;) and her own poor English skills at the time. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date. Viggo Mortensen read for a role as a sheriff.

Connery and Salomon eventually dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, fresh off the success of &quot;Desperado&quot;, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, who had also starred in &quot;Desperado&quot;, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez&#x27;s low-budget filming techniques for his action films, &quot;El Mariachi&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;, and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of &quot;Zorro&quot;. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez pulled out of the film in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget. The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson.

===Filming===
The principal photography for the film began in Mexico on January 27, 1997 on a $60 million (~$ in ) budget. &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; was mostly shot at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. Production stalled for four days in February when the director, Martin Campbell, was hospitalized for bronchitis. Filming resumed in Tlaxcala, three hours east of Mexico City, where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces. Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, who were busy running DreamWorks. Foster and David S. Ward, who went uncredited, re-wrote some scenes; the troubled production caused &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; to go $10 million over its budget. In December, the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items, including Zorro&#x27;s plastic sword, were held for nine days. Rossio and Elliott originally planned to have Don Rafael Montero be introduced by arriving on shore in a boat while sitting on a horse standing in the boat, but the scene was cut for being deemed too expensive. The idea was ultimately revisited by the duo for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;. During the post-production phase, Spielberg and Campbell decided that Diego de la Vega&#x27;s death in the arms of his daughter was too depressing. The ending, where Alejandro and Eléna are happily married with their infant son, was added three months after filming had ended.

===Lawsuit===
On January 24, 2001, Sony Pictures Entertainment filed a lawsuit in United States District Court, Central District of California, Western Division, against Fireworks Entertainment Group, the producers of the syndicated television series &quot;Queen of Swords&quot;. Sony alleged copyright infringement and other claims, saying the series &quot;copied protectable elements from [the] &#x27;Zorro&#x27; character and &#x27;Zorro&#x27; related works&quot;. On April 5, 2001, U.S. District Judge Collins denied Sony&#x27;s motion for a preliminary injunction, noting &quot;that since the copyrights in [Johnson McCulley&#x27;s 1919 short story] &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; and [the 1920 movie] &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain.&quot; As to specific elements of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, the judge found that any similarities between the film and the TV series&#x27; secondary characters and plot elements were insufficient to warrant an injunction.

==Soundtrack==
James Horner was hired to compose the film score in September 1997. The soundtrack, released by Sony Classical Records and Epic Soundtrax, was commercially successful and propelled by the rising profile of the Latin heartthrobs of Marc Anthony and Australian singer Tina Arena. Their duet, &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot;, plays in the closing credits of the film and was released as a single in Europe. The song went #3 on the French singles and #4 on the Dutch singles charts. At the 1999 ALMA Awards, it won Outstanding Performance of a Song for a Feature Film.

==Historical references==
&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; incorporate certain historical events and people into their narrative. Antonio Banderas&#x27; character, Alejandro Murrieta, is a fictional brother of Joaquin Murrieta, a real Mexican outlaw who was killed by the California Rangers led by Harry Love (portrayed in the film as Texas Army Captain &quot;Harrison Love&quot;) in 1853. The confrontation in the film takes place more than a decade earlier, in 1841. The capture of Murrieta&#x27;s right-hand man Three-Fingered Jack by Love was also historical; however, the real person was a Mexican named Manuel Garcia rather than an Anglo-American. As he did in the movie, the actual Harry Love preserved both Murrieta&#x27;s head and Jack&#x27;s hand in large, alcohol-filled glass jars.

==Release==
&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; was initially set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date was changed to March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date in an attempt to avoid competition with &quot;Titanic&quot;. In reality &quot;Zorro&quot; had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar&#x27;s parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.

To market &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot;, TriStar purchased a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, who had been known for their low-key presence at the ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached the film&#x27;s trailer to prints of &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and &quot;Zorro&quot; was Sony&#x27;s first film to use VRML.

&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; caught the attention of European Royalty with the film&#x27;s foreign premieres. Spain&#x27;s King Juan Carlos I, Queen Sophia, and Princess Elena attended the first Royal premiere in Madrid in seven years. On December 10, 1998, a Royal Command Performance for &quot;Zorro&quot; was toplined by Prince Charles and his sons.

===Home media===
&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 1, 1998 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The film was released on Blu-ray on December 1, 2009 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and in 4K UHD on May 5, 2020.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; has an approval score of 84% based on 79 reviews with an average score of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Banderas returns as an aging Zorro in this surprisingly nimble, entertaining swashbuckler.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; as a summer blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. &quot;The action in this movie, most of which takes the form of spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people,&quot; Schickel stated, &quot;is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature.&quot; &quot;Zorro&quot; exceeded the expectations of Roger Ebert, who was surprised by the screenplay&#x27;s display of traditional film craftsmanship. &quot;It&#x27;s a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, rather than the other way around.&quot; Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, and would later call it &quot;probably the best Zorro movie ever made.&quot; Mick LaSalle, writing in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, adding that the actor&#x27;s &quot;performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; found the film&#x27;s length to be &quot;somewhat overlong&quot; and lacking &quot;the snap and concision that would have put it over the top as a bang-up entertainment, but it&#x27;s closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than anything that&#x27;s come out of Hollywood in quite some time.&quot; In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film&#x27;s entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; to producer Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. &quot;While &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; isn&#x27;t on the same level, it&#x27;s not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn&#x27;t feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of &quot;Raiders&quot;,&quot; Berardinelli continued, &quot;there&#x27;s still plenty of action, tumult, and derring-do.&quot; He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, and that it would depend on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones.

In one of the film&#x27;s most popular scenes, Alejandro renders Eléna topless with a flurry of sword slashes. One critic placed it on his list of &quot;Erotic [Film] Scenes in the 90s&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 in 2,515 theaters, earning $22,525,855 (~$ in ) in its opening weekend. The film dropped from its number one position in the second week with the releases of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;. &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; eventually earned $94,095,523 within the United States, and $156,193,000 internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $250,288,523. With the commercial success of the film, Sony sold the television rights of &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; for $30 million in a joint deal to CBS and Turner Broadcasting System.

<doc id="705766" wikidata="Q644116" url="?curid=705766" title="Elliott Smith (album)">
<text>Elliott Smith is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter of the same name. It was recorded from late 1994 to early 1995, and released on July 21, 1995, through Kill Rock Stars, his first album on the label. It was preceded by the single &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot;, released in early January 1995.

== Background ==

After being impressed by Smith, Mary Lou Lord invited him to tour with her, and helped him to sign to Kill Rock Stars.

== Content ==

The album is of a similar musical style to &quot;Roman Candle&quot; in its minimalist, acoustic folk sound. Smith mostly appears alone on his acoustic guitar, although he is occasionally backed up by the odd musical instrument, such as a harmonica and drums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote of the album, &quot;the music burrows, digging up gems of structure, melody and lyrical vividness that belie his naïve delivery [...] the sound is hummable pop, slowed and drugged, with tricky but unshowy guitar work driving the melodies forward&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lyrics contain many references to drug use, which Smith claimed were merely metaphorical.

The album cover depicts two figures falling or jumping from a building. It is a xeroxed copy of a photograph taken by J.J. Gonson of a 1992 art installation at the former Museum of Modern Art at 17 Husova Street in Old Town, Prague. Gonson also photographed the cover for &quot;Roman Candle&quot;.

The lyrics also contain references to Portland&#x27;s neighborhood Foster-Powell and Alphabet Historic District, St. Ides malt liquor and the borough of Queens in New York City.

The song &quot;Clementine&quot; is a reworking of the 19th century American western folk ballad &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;, which Smith would reference again in a later song, &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, released in 1998 on &quot;XO&quot;. A later version of the track featured additional lyrics: &quot;97% was good, but 99% was so much better&quot;. 

The song &quot;Christian Brothers&quot; was also performed with Heatmiser in a full-band arrangement, recorded around the same time as the version featured on &quot;Elliott Smith&quot;; Heatmiser&#x27;s version was released on the soundtrack of &quot;Heaven Adores You&quot;, a 2014 documentary about Smith&#x27;s life and music.

Thematically, Smith said that he &quot;personally can&#x27;t get more dark&quot; than his self-titled album.

== Release ==

&quot;Needle in the Hay&quot;, the album&#x27;s only single, was released in early January 1995.

&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; was released on July 21, 1995, through Kill Rock Stars, making it his first full-length album on the label. In contrast to &quot;Roman Candle&quot;, &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; was &quot;promoted heavily&quot;, with posters of Smith appearing in the windows of record stores across the Northwest District of Portland, Oregon, where Smith lived at the time.

The album was reissued in a remastered and expanded 25th anniversary edition on August 28, 2020. The release also features a live album, &quot;Live at Umbra Penumbra&quot;, a 1994 performance at a Portland café, thought to be the earliest-known live recording of Smith performing as a solo artist. As part of the anniversary edition, J.J. Gonson, the artist behind the &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; album cover, released a 52-page coffee table book with handwritten lyrics, words from Smith&#x27;s peers about the album&#x27;s creation, and a series of previously unseen photographs. Gonson released a series of photo prints of Smith, one per month through August 2020, available for purchase through Morrison Hotel Gallery.

Of the reissue, Kill Rock Stars co-founder Slim Moon said:
== Reception ==
While not believed to have been reviewed by many, if any, critics at the time of its release, &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; has been critically well-received retrospectively. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote &quot;&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; contains the blueprint for his later successes, and more importantly, it&#x27;s a fully-realized work itself.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described it as &quot;bleak, almost uncomfortably unsparing and yet tragically beautiful&quot;, and that &quot;the songs, melodies, arrangements and production are all stronger and more fully realized than those on &quot;Roman Candle&quot;&quot;.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; as the twenty-seventh best song of the 1990s.

&quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; appeared in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, in a scene featuring a suicide attempt by Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson). Smith was reportedly unhappy about the song being used this way. The song appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

&quot;Christian Brothers&quot; has been covered by Queens of the Stone Age on the Canadian tour limited edition of their 2007 album &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;, with frontman Josh Homme emphasizing how much he loves the song.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Smith as &quot;ferociously talented&quot;, and the music as &quot;some of the loveliest songs about the dissolution of a soul ever written [...] hypnotic and terribly, unrelentingly sad&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album No. 50 on their 2022 list of the best albums of the decade.

<text>Embeth Jean Davidtz (born August 11, 1965) is an American-South African actress and director. She&#x27;s appeared in movies such as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List, &quot;&quot;Matilda&quot;, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary,&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man,&quot; and in the television series &quot;In Treatment&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot;, and Mad Men. 

In 2024 Davidtz made her directorial debut with &quot;Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,&quot; an adaptation of the best-selling memoir of the same name by Alexandra Fuller about growing up on a farm in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The film had its Canadian premiere at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).

== Early life ==
Davidtz was born on August 11, 1965, in Lafayette, Indiana, to South African parents John and Jean, while her father was studying chemical engineering at Purdue University. The family later moved to Trenton, New Jersey, and then to South Africa when Davidtz was nine years old. Davidtz has Dutch, English, and French ancestry. She had to learn Afrikaans before attending school classes in South Africa, where her father took up a teaching post at Potchefstroom University. Davidtz graduated from The Glen High School in Pretoria in 1983 and studied at Rhodes University in Grahamstown.

==Career==
===Debut and early career===
Davidtz made her acting debut at age 21 with CAPAB (Cape Performing Arts Board, now known as Artscape) in Cape Town, playing Juliet in a stage production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Maynardville Open-Air Theatre. Performing in English and Afrikaans, she also starred in other local plays, including &quot;Stille Nag&quot; (Silent Night) and &quot;A Chain of Voices&quot;, both earning her nominations for the South African equivalent of the Tony Award.

Her film debut came in 1988 with a small role in South African-filmed American horror &quot;Mutator&quot;. Shortly after, she won a bigger part in South African short telemovie &quot;A Private Life&quot;, as the daughter of an interracial couple. Davidtz won a DALRO Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the 1990 play &quot;Houd-den-bek&quot;. For the same play, she was nominated in 1991 for the Esther Roos Award for Best Actress in a Supporting role in Afrikaans film. Steven Spielberg noticed her performance in the 1992 South African film, &quot;Nag van die Negentiende&quot; and offered her the role of Helen Hirsch in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.

===Hollywood career===

In 1992, Davidtz played the part of Sheila in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; alongside Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. The third movie in the Evil Dead franchise would eventually become a big cult classic worldwide.

In 1993, Davidtz played the role of Helen Hirsch in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.

In 1995, Davidtz had a central role in the fact-based film &quot;Murder in the First&quot;, and the Merchant Ivory Productions &quot;Feast of July&quot;.

In 1996, she played the role of Miss Honey, the first-grade teacher of the title character, in &quot;Matilda&quot;.

<doc id="705777" wikidata="Q1353875" url="?curid=705777" title="Erik Carlsson">
<text>Erik Hilding Carlsson (5 March 1929 – 27 May 2015) was a Swedish rally driver for Saab. He was nicknamed &quot;Carlsson på taket&quot; (&quot;Carlsson on the roof&quot; in reference to Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s children&#x27;s book character) as well as &quot;Mr. Saab&quot; (due to his public relations work for the company).

==Early life==
Carlsson was born in Trollhättan. Erik Carlsson married Pat Moss on 9 July 1963 in London. Pat was also a famous rally driver and younger sister of Stirling Moss. On 1 December 1969 they had a daughter, Susie Carlsson, who was later to become successful in show jumping.

==Saab car history==
Because the early Saabs in which he competed were seriously underpowered and with the tuned two-strokers it was necessary to keep the revs up, he had to maintain a high speed while cornering and practiced left-foot braking to perfection.

==Rally career==

In 1965 Pat Moss and Erik Carlsson wrote a book: &quot;The Art and Technique of Driving&quot; (published by Heinemann, London, selling for 25 shillings). This book was translated into Dutch, German, Japanese and Spanish. 

The expression &quot;Carlsson on the roof&quot; originated from the children&#x27;s story &quot;Karlsson på taket&quot; by Astrid Lindgren, in which a &quot;Karlsson&quot; character lived on the roof of an apartment building. The name was given to Carlsson as a result of his habit of occasionally rolling a rally car onto its roof. In the Safari Rally, he even rolled the car intentionally, to escape from a mud pool. When journalists later doubted his story, he proved it by rolling the car again. The Ford factory team then tried the same stunt with their Ford Cortina, causing more damage to the car than had occurred during the entire rally.

Carlsson has done a number of unusual things during his rally career. During one rally in the United Kingdom, he needed a spare part and happened to find a brand new Saab 96 in a car park. He and the mechanic quickly started disassembling the car when the rather upset owner discovered them. The co-driver managed to defuse the situation by explaining that Carlsson was a factory driver for Saab and the owner would be given a new car. In the end Carlsson could keep driving and they remained friends and still exchange Christmas cards. At the time, rally regulations often stipulated penalties for damage to the car at the finish. Towards the end of the rally, Carlsson&#x27;s car had acquired dents to both the front fender and one door, so to avoid the penalty points they stopped and switched the door and bumper with the support car. Then it looked a bit suspicious to have a clean door and fender while the rest of the car was covered in mud and dust. As they had no water they used the spare gasoline to wash off the car. Reporters covering the event were impressed that they had had the time to wash the car before arriving at the rally finish. After the finishing festivities, Carlsson looked out the window from his hotel room and saw the support car parked outside: clean, but with a dirty door and fender, still with the starting number visible in the dust.

Carlsson started the 1959 Rally of Portugal leading the European championship. His closest competitor was Paul Coltelloni, a works Citroën team driver, but to prevent Carlsson from winning, Citroën had bought Coltelloni an Alfa Romeo. As the event passed through Spain, the blue Saab Carlsson was sharing with British Rally Champion John Sprinzel began suffering from a grabbing front brake. Cresting the brow of a hill in the gathering dusk at over , the crew spotted a closed railway level crossing only yards in front of them. Heavy braking caused the car to spin and roll over into the barrier, where they narrowly avoided being hit by the passing train. Despite this incident, and the subsequent electrical problems it caused, they finished third and it was enough to finish fourth for Carlsson to win the championship. However, shortly before the prize ceremony, they were told they would be given a 25-point penalty for their car having white competition numbers on a black background, instead of the other way around. Still, 25 penalty points only pushed them down to 4th place, so the European championship would be safe. It was only at the prize ceremony itself that they discovered that they had been given an additional 25-point penalty, putting them in eighth position. When they asked why, they were told they had been given 25 penalty points &quot;per door&quot;.

In the 1966 &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; Carlsson drove an almost-competitive car, a Saab Sonett II. The two-stroke engine had been bored to 940 cc compared to the 841 of the standard model and it gave at most . The final drive was geared down so the top speed was only , but could be reached from standstill in eight seconds. The car was capable of holding station with the Porsche 904. But they ran into problems with the spark plugs. Frequent spark plug changes were not unusual for tuned two-stroke engines, but it used up spark plugs at an unusual rate and soon they had run out of spare spark plugs and had to give up. Sabotage was suspected and the gasoline was sent to Saab for analysis, where they found that it had been contaminated with a foreign substance.

In the 1961 German Rally the DKW team started a rumour that he was using an illicit four-speed gearbox in his Saab 96 (the standard car only had three gears). They disassembled the gearbox, but found no fourth gear. It turned out that Carlsson had fooled them by dipping the clutch in third gear to make it sound like a four speed. In 2010, Carlsson was among the first four inductees into the Rally Hall of Fame, along with Rauno Aaltonen, Paddy Hopkirk and Timo Mäkinen. 

Carlsson died on 27 May 2015 after battling a short illness.

<text>Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) is an OASIS-approved network protocol standard designed for communications with remote portlets.

==Overview==
The WSRP specification defines a web service interface for interacting with presentation-oriented web services. Initial work was produced through the joint efforts of the Web Services for Interactive Applications (WSIA) and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committees. With the approval of WSRP v1 as an OASIS standard in September, 2003, these two technical committees merged and continued the work as the Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committee.

Scenarios that motivate WSRP functionality include:
* content hosts, such as portal servers, providing portlets as presentation-oriented web services that can be used by aggregation engines;
* content aggregators, such as portal servers, consuming presentation-oriented web services provided by portal or non-portal content providers and integrating them into a portal framework.

==Implementation==
The WSRP specification does not make any statements as to implementation. Java&#x27;s portlet specification, JSR 168, and WSRP are not competing technologies. JSR 168 may be used to define a portlet, and WSRP may be used to define a portlet&#x27;s operations to remote containers. JSR 168 portlets and WSRP may be used together to define a portlet and to provide remote operations. Similarly, .NET portlets may be created for use with WSRP. Interoperability between JSR 168 and .NET WSRP implementations has been demonstrated.

There are several WSRP implementations to assist developers:
* The Oracle WebCenter provides a standards based implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers.
* The IBM WebSphere Portal provides an implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers.
* Up to version 7.0 the Liferay Portal / DXP provides an implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers available in both its commercial Enterprise Edition and open source Community Edition.
* Microsoft provides a WSRP producer and consumer WebPart for SharePoint 2007, but only a WSRP consumer WebPart for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013.
* The OpenPortal WSRP project&#x27;s goal is to create a high quality, enterprise-class WSRP v1 and v2 producer and consumer with an associated developer community.
* The GateIn Portal project (JBoss &amp; eXo Platform), provides an implementation of both WSRP v1 and v2 (as of GateIn 3.1.0), producer and consumer using GateIn and GateIn Portlet Container.
* Apache WSRP4J was an Apache Incubator subproject spearheaded by IBM with the stated goal of &quot;kick starting the broad adoption&quot; of WSRP. WSRP4J was designed to assist in the development and deployment of WSRP v1 services. WSRP4J was in incubator status, primarily due to patent concerns revolving around the WSRP specification. Given WSRP4J&#x27;s incubator status, the project did not produce formal releases. The project has been terminated in 2010.

The first release, WSRP v1, provided a limited interoperability platform. Further versions of WSRP v1 were abandoned so that effort could be concentrated on WSRP v2. WSRP v2 augments the initial standard with cross-portlet coordination and access management features. This major update to the standard permits a more useful integration of multiple content sources, regardless of whether they are local or remote, into a new web application. In addition, WSRP v2 supports Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX and REST, without requiring them. WSRP v2 was approved by OASIS on April 1, 2008.

<doc id="705783" wikidata="Q3495871" url="?curid=705783" title="Black ribbon">
<text>A black ribbon is a symbol of remembrance or mourning. It is often worn or put on a public display to express consolation.

==Sign of mourning==

Similar to a black armband, the black ribbon is a public display of grief. Individuals or organizations display the ribbon in commemoration of victims after specific incidents.

Some examples include:

* Black ribbons were worn and placed on doors after the May 1992 Westray Mine Disaster in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada. 
* The ribbon was worn in the United Kingdom after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.
* Students distributed black ribbons after the April 2007 Virginia Tech shooting at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.
* The black ribbon has been used by the journalists in the Philippines to condemn the killings of journalists on the Maguindanao massacre. 
* The 2013 London Marathon runners were given a black ribbon to wear to mark the Boston Marathon bombing.
* A black ribbon was projected onto the Sydney Opera House in April 2024 as a tribute to the victims of the 2024 Bondi Junction stabbings in Sydney, Australia.
The search engine Google, which often changes the company&#x27;s logo to a Google Doodle commemorating timely events, has used the black ribbon to mark a number of incidents. These include the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting, the charter flight crash in Colombia in November 2016, the 2017 Portugal wildfires, and the death of Queen Elizabeth II. April 9, 2017, Google Arabic displayed a black ribbon as a mark of respect and sympathy for victims of 2017 Palm Sunday church bombings in Tanta and Alexandria, Egypt.

To show sympathy for victims of the 2023 earthquake in Turkey and Syria, Turkish Wikipedia and Apple&#x27;s website homepage in Turkey changed to show a glowing black ribbon atop a dark background.

==Other meanings==
* Melanoma awareness. Sometimes shown as black with white polka dots.
* In Argentina, a black ribbon, sometimes with the national flag&#x27;s colours in both ends, is used to raise awareness about the victims of subversive terrorism.
* By the Anarchist Black Ribbon Campaign, a free speech campaign started in 1996 inspired by the Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign.
* During the 6th International Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW) the black ribbon was worn worldwide to show support and promote awareness of the Palestinian struggle.
* In India, 2011 to show support to Anna Hazare who was fasting to fight against corruption by government.
* Worn by people who have suffered from any intentions of self harming on November 30 of every year.
* In New Zealand, a black ribbon with a koru symbol supports an end to domestic violence. In Australia, a black ribbon raises awareness against domestic abuse of men and fathers.

==In fiction==
* In the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels by Terry Pratchett, the black ribbon is instead worn by vampires to prove, in the vein of the real-world blue ribbon badge, that they have sworn never to drink blood again.

<doc id="705791" wikidata="Q476428" url="?curid=705791" title="Dummy load">
<text>A dummy load is a device used to simulate an electrical load, usually for testing purposes. In radio a dummy antenna is connected to the output of a radio transmitter and electrically simulates an antenna, to allow the transmitter to be adjusted and tested without radiating radio waves. In audio systems, a dummy load is connected to the output of an amplifier to electrically simulate a loudspeaker, allowing the amplifier to be tested without producing sound. Load banks are connected to electrical power supplies to simulate the supply&#x27;s intended electrical load for testing purposes.

==Radio==

In radio this device is also known as a dummy antenna or a radio frequency termination. It is a device, usually a resistor, used in place of an antenna to aid in testing a radio transmitter. It is substituted for the antenna while one adjusts the transmitter, so that no radio waves are radiated so that the transmitter does not interfere with other radio transmitters during the adjustments.
(As no dummy load is ideal, however, some radiation does occur).
 If a transmitter is tested without a load attached to its output terminals such as an antenna or a dummy load, the power will be reflected back into the transmitter, often overheating and damaging it. Also, if a transmitter is adjusted without a load, it will operate differently as compared with a load, and the adjustments may be incorrect.

The dummy load ordinarily should be a pure resistance; the amount of resistance should be the same as the impedance of the antenna or transmission line that is used with the transmitter (usually 50 Ω or 75 Ω).
The radio energy that is absorbed by the dummy load is converted to heat. A dummy load must be chosen or designed to tolerate the amount of power that can be delivered by the transmitter. Typically it consists of a resistor attached to some type of heat sink to dissipate the power from the transmitter.

The ideal dummy load provides a standing wave ratio (SWR) of 1:1 at the given impedance.

Veterinarian-grade mineral oil, an inexpensive form of mineral oil, is frequently used by amateur radio operators as coolant in RF dummy loads.

==Audio==
When testing audio amplifiers, it is common to replace the loudspeaker with a dummy load, so that the amplifier&#x27;s handling of large power levels can be tested without actually producing intense sound. The simplest is a resistor bank to simulate the voice coil&#x27;s resistance.

For loudspeaker simulation, a more complex network is more accurate, however, as actual loudspeakers are reactive and non-linear. There are many designs for loudspeaker simulators, which emphasize different characteristics of the actual speaker, such as the voice coil&#x27;s inductance, mechanical suspension compliance, and cone mass.

==Power supplies==
There are also dummy loads for power supplies, known as load banks. These may be used, for example, for factory and in-service testing of standby generators. A load bank may be used to stabilize a power system in case of loss of load, for example, on an isolated wind or mini-hydro plant.

An electronic load (or e-load) is a device or assembly that simulates loading on an electronic circuit.
It is used as substitute for a conventional ohmic load resistor.
As counterpart to a current source, the electronic load is a current sink. When loading a current source with a fixed resistor one can set one determined load current by the connected load resistor. The characteristic of the electronic load is that the load current can be set and varied in a defined range. The load current is regulated electronically.

The electronic load consumes electric energy and in most cases transforms it into heat. Fans or water-cooled elements are used as coolers. Under certain conditions, energy-recycling into the public power supply system is also possible.

Electronic loads are used in diverse applications, particularly for the test of power supplies, batteries, solar and fuel cells, generators. AC loads are used to test transformers, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or onboard power supplies.
The equipment and power spectrum of such electronic loads begins with simplest circuits consisting in general of a potentiometer for current setting and a transistor circuit for power transforming. Further developed electronic loads supply several operating modes, in most cases constant current, voltage, power and resistance. Nowadays, the equipment may be controlled by a PLC or remotely by a PC. Settings and measured values such as input voltage and actual load current are indicated on a display.

<text>The Elders of the Universe are a group of supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Collector was the first Elder to appear, and featured in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #28 (May 1966), but the idea that he was a member of a group known as the Elders was not introduced until &quot;The Avengers&quot; #174 (Aug. 1978).

==Fictional history==
The Elders of the Universe are the last survivors of otherwise extinct races. Each discovered that they had potentially infinite lifespans, dependent on maintaining the will to continue living. They are thus known for their personal obsessions (such as collecting, contests of strategy or strength, and various fields of study), each of which is pursued fanatically. While the characters are not truly cosmic entities, all have achieved some cosmic level of power and knowledge related to their particular pursuit. The first encounter with the heroes of Earth occurs when the Collector came to Earth seeking to expand his collection. Later, the Grandmaster created the supervillain team the Squadron Sinister as pawns to battle the champions of the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror, the superhero team the Avengers.

Although thwarted, the Grandmaster and his fellow Elders take an interest in Earth, and the Collector has two separate encounters with the Avengers, the second ending with his murder by the entity Korvac. The Grandmaster also tricks the entity Death into playing a contest—again involving many of Earth&#x27;s heroes—that he deliberately loses to resurrect the Collector. The Grandmaster usurps control of Death&#x27;s realm, and after a battle between the Avengers and the Grandmaster&#x27;s champions—the Legion of the Unliving—is tricked by the Avengers. An angered Death then prevents the Elders from ever entering her realm, which effectively makes them immortal and is the Grandmaster&#x27;s true goal.

The Elder known as the Champion of the Universe has a brief encounter with many of Earth&#x27;s strongest heroes and challenged them to a boxing match. While he did have them use his personal gym to prepare, the Champion of the Universe had to disqualify Namor when he refused to stoop to training and Doc Samson, whom the Champion declared to not be a worthy opponent. The day of the boxing match came around as the Champion of the Universe faces off against his opponents. After disqualifying Thor, Hulk, and Wonder Man for different reasons and defeating by knockout Colossus and Sasquatch in hand-to-hand combat, he faces Ben Grimm of the Fantastic Four. Eventually realizing that Grimm would never submit under any circumstances, the Champion concedes the match and offers Grimm his respect.

A group of eleven Elders later join forces and meet on Ego the Living Planet (who is also regarded as an Elder) in an effort to kill the cosmic entity Galactus, which would cause the concepts Eternity and Death to become unbalanced and end the universe. The Elders believe since they are now immortal they would be the only beings to survive and would be supreme beings in the new universe. The plan, however, is thwarted by Galactus&#x27; Heralds the Silver Surfer and Nova. Galactus captures and consumes five of the Elders (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster and Runner), but three other Elders (Astronomer, Possessor and Trader) are sucked into a black hole and pass through it into a mystical universe. Two Elders avoid the wrath of Galactus and his hunger, The Contemplater and the Obliterator. Both meet with each other being seemingly the last known surviving Elders and plot their revenge against the universe.

Despite this setback, the eight Elders continue their plot against Galactus. While the five Elders within Galactus inflict a fatal case of &quot;cosmic indigestion&quot; upon him, the three Elders in the mystical realm conspire with the cosmic entity the In-Betweener to restore him in exchange for him returning them to their home reality and his promise to kill Galactus. Using the Silver Surfer, Mister Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman (whom Galactus had sent in search of the Infinity Gems), the In-Betweener is restored, and he brings the Elders back to their own reality. Once there, the In-Betweener attempts to kill Galactus, but discovers that he cannot do so. When he announces his intention to hurl Galactus into the black hole instead, the three Elders, who wanted to rescue their brother Elders from within Galactus, threaten him with the other five Infinity Gems to stop him. The In-Betweener responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate them despite her vow. As a result, the Astronomer, the Trader and the Possessor and his Runestaff are apparently disintegrated. The ship carrying Galactus is then thrown into the black hole and passes through to the mystical realm where the In-Betweeners&#x27;s creators, Master Order and Lord Chaos, force the five Elders within Galactus to exit his body, restoring the world-devourer. During the subsequent battle between Galactus and the In-Betweener, the quintet are eventually persuaded to help Galactus defeat his foe. Moments later, the five Elders use their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.

Another Elder, the Contemplator, allies with the space pirate Captain Reptyl against the Silver Surfer, but is betrayed and apparently killed. The Contemplator is revealed to have survived—as a disembodied head—and goes on to attempt to rule the Kree Empire, but is seemingly destroyed by the peace-loving alien Cotati.

The five Elders that were previously consumed by Galactus (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner) are targeted by the Titan Thanos because they possess the Infinity Gems. Thanos humiliates each in turn (the Gardener is murdered) and captures the Gems. The Elder the Runner has an encounter with the hero Quasar during which the time being Eon describes the Runner as one of &quot;the thousand or so Elders I&#x27;m aware of.&quot; Quasar also later confronts the Obliterator, the Possessor, and previously unknown Elders the Explorer, the Judicator and the Caregiver. It is also revealed that the Contemplator killed by Reptyl was a Skrull and not the true Contemplator.

The Grandmaster reappears and creates a new version of the Squadron Sinister. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power—an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities—the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister&#x27;s powers and they battle the superhero team the New Thunderbolts. The Grandmaster is defeated by Helmut Zemo, and the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape. Champion has an encounter with the heroine She-Hulk and aids her foe Titania by giving her the Power Gem, currently in his possession.

The Astronomer, Champion, Grandmaster, Judicator, and Runner traveled to the planet Godthab Omega, and witnessed the arrival of the Annihilation Wave.

After Battleworld is destroyed in &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the Elders examine the planet&#x27;s remains, and find them to be teeming with Power Primordial in the form of an &quot;Iso-Sphere&quot;. Their inability to come to a mutually beneficial agreement regarding ownership of the Iso-Sphere prompts the Elders into holding a winner-takes-all Contest of Champions which all but the Grandmaster and Collector are eventually eliminated from.

During the &quot;No Surrender&quot; arc, it was revealed that one Elder of the Universe originally went by the name of Grandmaster before being defeated by En Dwi Gast and banished from the Earth-616 reality. Because of the Multiverse being rebuilt, this Elder of the Universe returned where he took the name of Challenger and assembled his version of the Black Order to go up against Grandmaster and his Lethal Legion.

The &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline introduced an Elder of the Universe called the Profiteer.

==Powers and abilities==
Each Elder of the Universe possesses a fraction of the Power Primordial, remnants of the primordial energies of the Big Bang that still permeate the universe. The Power Primordial can be used to produce a wide range of effects, including augmentation of physical attributes (strength, durability, speed), molecular restructuring, creation of force fields, teleportation and numerous other abilities. Some Elders have incorporated this power into their singular obsessions and developed its potential in themselves (i.e. Champion, Runner) while others have to varying degrees mixed that power with tools or resources their obsessions afforded them (i.e. Contemplator, Grandmaster, Obliterator) or even largely ignored it as irrelevant or detrimental to their pursuits (i.e. Gardener, Collector).

Each Elder has developed skills related to their particular field of interest over a lifespan measured in billions of years. In their particular fields of endeavor (i.e. Grandmaster in strategy, Caregiver in medicine), they have essentially unrivaled superhuman levels of talent and expertise.

<doc id="705805" wikidata="Q1856563" url="?curid=705805" title="David Canary">
<text>David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938 – November 16, 2015) was an American actor. Canary is best known for his roles as ranch foreman Candy Canaday in the NBC Western drama &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and as Adam Chandler in the television soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, for which he received 16 Daytime Emmy Award nominations and won five times.

==Early life==
Canary was born in Elwood, Indiana, and grew up in Massillon, Ohio. He was the middle son of Hilary Canary and Lorena Heal. His brothers were actor John Canary, who once had a role in &quot;All My Children&quot;, and writer Hilary Glenn Canary. The brothers were purportedly great-great-nephews of Martha Jane Canary, Calamity Jane.

==Football==
Canary starred as an end on both offense and defense on the football team at Massillon Washington High School, where he graduated in 1956. The school honored him as a Distinguished Citizen 35 years later in 1991. He earned a football scholarship to the University of Cincinnati, where he was a three-year letterman from 1957 to 1959 and the recipient of the John Pease Award, as the program&#x27;s best lineman, in his junior and senior years. Canary trained as a singer at the university&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in music in 1960. He was picked by the Denver Broncos in the inaugural 1960 American Football League (AFL) draft. Commenting on the selection in a 2004 interview for the Archive of American Television, he said, &quot;I thought they were out of their minds. I was 172 pounds, I wasn&#x27;t very fast, and I couldn&#x27;t catch a pass. They called me stone fingers.&quot;

==Career==
Instead of signing with the Broncos, he opted to head to New York City to become an actor. He served two years in the United States Army, where he entered an All-Army Entertainment Contest in 1963. After ending his service, Canary moved to Los Angeles to continue his acting career.

After a semi-regular role as Russ Gehring in the primetime serial &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, Canary came to international prominence in 1967 on the Western series &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In 1967, he appeared in the now-classic Western movie &quot;Hombre&quot; with Paul Newman, Richard Boone, and Cameron Mitchell. Canary guest-starred in the two-part episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; entitled &quot;Nitro&quot; (S12E28-29) as George McClaney, a poor man who found high pay creating nitroglycerin. He also played mobster Frank Gusenberg in the film &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; and appeared on the short-lived CBS Western &quot;Dundee and the Culhane&quot;.

A contract dispute that year between Leonard Nimoy and the producers of &quot;Star Trek&quot; forced Herb Solow, Robert H. Justman, and Gene Roddenberry to compile a list of candidates for consideration to take over the role of Mr. Spock. As revealed in Solow and Justman&#x27;s book, &quot;Star Trek - The Inside Story&quot;, Canary was one of these candidates.

David Dortort, the creator and producer of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, saw Canary in &quot;Hombre&quot; and cast him in the role of the new ranch foreman, Candy Canaday. Dortort said that Canary was &quot;the kind of kid who comes on and suddenly, there&#x27;s nobody else on the screen.&quot; Canary left &quot;Bonanza&quot; in June 1970 after a contract dispute. He returned in May 1972 after Dan Blocker&#x27;s death. Canary said that he loved &quot;Bonanza&quot;, except for filming in Nevada in 100° heat.

Canary&#x27;s most notable stage performance was on Broadway in the original production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Clothes for a Summer Hotel&quot;, which starred Geraldine Page. A baritone, he also appeared on Broadway with Colleen Dewhurst in &quot;Great Day in the Morning&quot;, and he did numerous musical stage roles in shows such as &quot;Kismet&quot;, &quot;Man Of La Mancha&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks, Sweeney Todd and Carousel&quot;, along with dramatic performances in &quot;The Seagull,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot; and &quot;Clarence Darrow.&quot; 

Canary&#x27;s first daytime television role was on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, where he played the short-term role of Liza Walton&#x27;s agent. He had two short stints on &quot;The Doctors&quot; as Far Wind, a cult leader who took the hospital staff hostage and killed Melissa Dancy (Dorian Lo Pinto). In 1981, he assumed the role of Steve Frame on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. The revival of the Steve/Alice/Rachel love triangle was unsuccessful, and he left the show in 1983 after his character was killed off.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1983, he joined the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot; in the role of Adam Chandler. The following year, he was also cast as Adam&#x27;s meek twin brother, Stuart, who everybody (including the audience) believed was Adam. A May 2009 storyline had Adam accidentally shoot and kill Stuart while using prescription narcotics. Canary retired from full-time acting and departed from &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2010; his last episode was taped in late March and aired on April 23, 2010. He announced that he intended to return to &quot;AMC&quot; occasionally. He reprised both of his roles as Adam and Stuart Chandler for several days before the series finale on ABC on September 23, 2011. In 2013, he returned to the role of Adam when the show began to produce online episodes.

Canary&#x27;s primetime television guest appearances include &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;Primus&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Kung-Fu&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Remember WENN&quot;, and &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot;. The actor also appeared as the locomotive engineer in the movie &quot;Atomic Train&quot;. In 2004, he appeared as mathematical genius Robert in a well-reviewed production of David Auburn&#x27;s &quot;Proof&quot; in Canton, Ohio, near his hometown of Massillon.

Canary was known to be affable and accessible to fans of both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;. At Disney resorts, he did &quot;meet and greet&quot; appearances where he signed autographs for &quot;AMC&quot; fans. He also made several appearances at the Lake Tahoe site of the Ponderosa Ranch, a tourist attraction from 1967 to 2004. His last appearance at the ranch in character was in 2002 for a PAX-TV special. In March 2012, David was named as the replacement for the ailing, 90-year-old Jack Klugman in a limited-run production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Canary was married to actress Maureen Maloney, with whom he had a son, Chris, and a daughter, Kate. With his first wife, actress Julie M. Anderson, he had a daughter, Lisa.

===Death===
Canary died on November 16, 2015 at an assisted living facility in Wilton, Connecticut, at the age of 77; he had been diagnosed with dementia years before.

== Filmography ==


==Awards and nominations==
Canary won five Daytime Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and was nominated an additional 11 times, most recently in 2008 for Best Lead Actor.

<doc id="705808" wikidata="Q2525166" url="?curid=705808" title="Jefferson C. Davis">
<text>Jefferson Columbus Davis (March 2, 1828 – November 30, 1879) was a regular officer of the United States Army during the American Civil War, known for the similarity of his name to that of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and for his killing of a superior officer in 1862.

Davis&#x27;s distinguished service in Mexico earned him high prestige at the outbreak of the Civil War, when he led Union troops through Southern Missouri to Pea Ridge, Arkansas, being promoted to Brigadier General after that significant victory. Following the Siege of Corinth, he was granted home leave on account of exhaustion, but returned to duty on hearing of Union defeats in Kentucky, where he reported to General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson at Louisville in September 1862. Nelson was dissatisfied with his performance, and insulted him in front of witnesses. A few days later, Davis demanded a public apology, but instead the two officers argued noisily and physically, concluding in Davis mortally wounding Nelson with a pistol.

Davis avoided conviction due to the shortage of experienced commanders in the Union Army, but the incident hampered his chances for promotion. He served as a corps commander under William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in 1864. After the war, Davis was the first commander of the Department of Alaska from 1867 to 1870, and assumed field command during the Modoc War of 1872–1873.

==Early life==

Jefferson C. Davis was born in Clark County, Indiana, near present-day Memphis, Indiana. He was born to William Davis Jr. (1800–1879) and Mary Drummond-Davis (1801–1881), the oldest of their eight children. His father was a farmer. His parents came from Kentucky, and like many at the time including President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s family, moved to Indiana.

==Early military career==
When Davis was 19 years old, in June 1847, he joined the 3rd Indiana Volunteers. He enlisted as a soldier during the Mexican–American War. Through the war, he received promotions through the rank of sergeant. He received a commission as a second lieutenant, in the First U.S. Artillery, in June 1848. He received the promotion for bravery at Buena Vista. He joined the 1st Artillery in October 1848 at Fort McHenry, outside of Baltimore, Maryland. He later moved south to Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside Washington DC, and again to the coast of Mississippi. He was promoted again to first lieutenant in February 1852 and was transferred to Florida in 1853 and on to Fortress Monroe in Virginia. In 1857, he was stationed again in Fort McHenry moving to Florida in 1858. In the summer of 1858, he received a transfer to Fort Moultrie, South Carolina. Fort Moultrie was located near Fort Sumter and Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in South Carolina until Fort Sumter was evacuated at the beginning of the Civil War, in 1861.

When the war began in April 1861, Davis was an officer in the garrison at Fort Sumter when it was bombarded by Confederate forces. The following month he was promoted to captain and given the task of raising a regiment in Indiana. Additionally, he was given responsibility over the commissary and supply. He requested assignment as a regimental commander, growing bored with his garrison duties. After the death of Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon and the loss at Wilson&#x27;s Creek, his request was gratefully accepted. His experience as a regular in the federal army made him a rare commodity, and he was given command of the 22nd Indiana Infantry Regiment, receiving a promotion to colonel.

===Missouri===
By the end of August, Davis received orders to succeed Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of forces in northwestern Missouri. His headquarters were in Jefferson City, Missouri, with approximately 16,000 Confederate troops nearby. General Fremont had great concerns that the Confederate troops, commanded by Generals McCulloch and Sterling Price, would set their eyes on St. Louis as a potential target. Davis&#x27;s command grew quickly, starting at 12,000 at the beginning of September and expanding to 18,000 to 20,000 by the end of the month. Initially, Davis spent time building fortifications to fend off possible attack on the capital city. Once his defensive plan had been completed, he planned an offensive campaign, but materiel was refused to Davis. That may have contributed to losing the Battle of Lexington.

In December 1861, he took command of the 3rd Division, Army of the Southwest. He pursued Confederate troops through southern Missouri, as they retreated toward and into Arkansas. In March 1862, his division attacked the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Davis&#x27;s distinguished service at Pea Ridge was rewarded in May 1862 when he received a field promotion commensurate with his division command. He was made Brigadier General with the rank backdated to December 18, 1861.

At the Siege of Corinth, he commanded the 4th Division, Army of the Mississippi.

===Leave authorized===
In the late summer of 1862, Davis became ill, probably caused by exhaustion. He wrote to his commander, General Rosecrans, requesting a few weeks&#x27; leave. Davis stated, &quot;After twenty-one months of arduous service... I find myself compelled by physical weakness and exhaustion to ask... for a few weeks&#x27; respite from duty...&quot; On August 12, 1862, the Army of Mississippi issued General Rosecrans&#x27; response in Special Order No. 208, authorizing General Davis 20 days of convalescence. Davis headed for home in Indiana to rest and recuperate.

While Davis was on leave, the state of affairs in Kentucky became quite precarious. The Army of the Ohio, commanded by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell, was taking aim on Chattanooga, Tennessee. Three hundred miles of railway lines lay between Louisville and Chattanooga, and Confederate forces were making constant work tearing up the tracks. The railroads provided the needed supplies to Union troops on the move and so Buell was forced to split his forces and to send General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson back north to Kentucky to take charge of the area. When Nelson arrived in Louisville, he found Major General Horatio G. Wright had been sent by the President to take control, putting Buell second in command.

In late August, two Confederate armies, under the command of Major General Edmund Kirby Smith and General Braxton Bragg, moved into Kentucky and Tennessee on the offensive to drive Union forces from Kentucky. Smith&#x27;s Army of East Tennessee had approximately 19,000 men and Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee had approximately 35,000. On August 23, 1862, Confederate cavalry met and defeated Union troops at the Battle of Big Hill. That was only a prelude to the bigger battle ahead; on August 29, 1862, portions of Smith&#x27;s army met an equal portion of Nelson&#x27;s force that numbered between 6,000 and 7,000. The two-day Battle of Richmond, ending on August 30, was an overwhelming Confederate victory in all aspects: Union casualties numbered over 5,000, compared to the 750 Confederate casualties, and considerable ground was lost, including Richmond; Lexington; and the state capital, Frankfort. Further loss at the battle occurred with the capture of Brigadier General Mahlon D. Manson and the wounding of General Nelson, injured in the neck, who was forced to retreat back to Louisville to prepare for the presumed assault. The Confederates were now in a position to aim northward to take the fight to the enemy.

===Louisville===
Davis was quite aware of the circumstances in the neighboring state to the south; Smith was able to strike at Cincinnati, Ohio, Bragg and/or Smith at Louisville. Davis, still on convalescence, reported to General Wright, whose headquarters were in Cincinnati to offer his services. Wright ordered Davis to report to Nelson. In Louisville, Davis was put in charge of organizing and arming its citizens, preparing for its defense.

Nelson was quite an imposing figure over Davis. William Nelson got his nickname, &quot;Bull,&quot; in no small part to his stature. Nelson was 300 pounds and six feet two inches and was described as being &quot;in the prime of life, in perfect health.&quot; Davis was quite small in comparison, measuring five feet nine inches and reportedly only 125 pounds.

====Dismissal from Louisville====

In September 22, two days after Davis received his initial orders from Nelson, he was summoned to the Galt House, where Nelson had made his headquarters. Nelson inquired on how the recruitment was going and how many men had been mustered. Davis replied that he did not know. As Nelson asked his questions and received only short answers that Davis was unaware of any specifics, Nelson became enraged and expelled Davis from Louisville. General James Barnet Fry, described as a close friend of Davis, was present and later wrote of the events surrounding the death of Nelson. Fry states:

Davis arose and remarked, in a cool, deliberate manner: &quot;General Nelson, I am a regular soldier, and I demand the treatment due to me as a general officer.&quot; Davis then stepped across to the door of the Medical Director&#x27;s room, both doors being open... and said: &quot;Dr Irwin, I wish you to be a witness to this conversation.&quot; At the same time Nelson said: &quot;Yes, doctor, I want you to remember this.&quot; Davis then said to Nelson: &quot;I demand from you the courtesy due to my rank.&quot; Nelson replied: &quot;I will treat you as you deserve. You have disappointed me; you have been unfaithful to the trust which I reposed in you, and I shall relieve you at once. You are relieved from duty here and you will proceed to Cincinnati and report to General Wright.&quot; Davis said: &quot;You have no authority to order me.&quot; Nelson turned toward the Adjutant-General and said: &quot;Captain, if General Davis does not leave the city by nine o&#x27;clock tonight, give instructions to the Provost-Marshal to see that he shall be put across the Ohio River.&quot; 

====Reassigned to Louisville====
Davis made his way to Cincinnati and reported to General Wright within a few days. Within the same week, Buell returned to Louisville and took command from Nelson. Wright then felt that with Buell in command at Louisville, there was no need to keep Davis from Louisville, where his leadership was desperately needed and so sent Davis back to there.

Davis arrived in Louisville in the afternoon on Sunday, September 28, and reported to the Galt House early the next morning, at breakfast time. The Galt House continued to serve as the command&#x27;s headquarters for both Buell and Nelson. That, like on most other mornings, was the meeting place for many of the most prominent military and civil leaders. When Davis arrived and looked around the room, he saw many familiar faces and joined Oliver P. Morton, Indiana&#x27;s governor.

====Killing of Nelson====
A short time later, General Nelson entered the hotel and went to the front desk. Davis approached Nelson, asking for an apology for the offense that Nelson had previously made. Nelson dismissed Davis and said, &quot;Go away you damned puppy, I don&#x27;t want anything to do with you!&quot; Davis took in his hand a registration card and, while he confronted Nelson, took his anger out on the card, first by gripping it and then by wadding it up into a small ball, which he took and flipped into Nelson&#x27;s face. Nelson stepped forward and slapped Davis with the back of his hand in the face. Nelson then looked at the governor and asked, &quot;Did you come here, sir, to see me insulted?&quot; Morton said, &quot;No sir.&quot; Then, Nelson turned and left for his room.

That set the events in motion. Davis asked a friend from the Mexican–American War if he had a pistol, which he did not. He then asked another friend, Thomas W. Gibson, from whom he got a pistol. Immediately, Davis went down the corridor towards Nelson&#x27;s office, where he was now standing. He aimed the pistol at Nelson and fired. The bullet hit Nelson in the chest and tore a small hole in the heart, mortally wounding the large man. Nelson still had the strength to make his way to the hotel stairs and to climb a floor before he collapsed. By then, a crowd started to gather around him and carried Nelson to a nearby room, laying him on the floor. The hotel proprietor, Silas F. Miller, came rushing into the room to find Nelson lying on the floor. Nelson asked of Miller, &quot;Send for a clergyman; I wish to be baptized. I have been basely murdered.&quot; Reverend J. Talbot was called, who responded, as well as a doctor. Several people came to see Nelson, including Reverend Talbot, Surgeon Murry, General Crittenden and General Fry. The shooting had occurred at 8:00 am, and by 8:30, Nelson was dead.

====Arrest and release====
Davis did not leave the vicinity of Nelson. He did not run or evade capture. He was simply taken into military custody by Fry and confined to an upper room in the Galt House. Davis attested to Fry what had happened. Fry wrote that while Davis was improperly treated for a man of his rank, he never pursued any legal recourse, which there was available to him. Fry attested that Davis was quite forthcoming and even included the fact that it was he who flipped a paper-wad in the face of Nelson. Davis wanted to confront Nelson publicly and wanted Nelson&#x27;s disrespect to be witnessed. What Davis had not accounted for was Nelson&#x27;s physical assault. Everything then spiraled out of control.

Many in close confidence with Nelson wanted to see quick justice with regards to Davis. There were a few, including General William Terrill, who wanted to see Davis hanged on the spot. Buell weighed in by saying that Davis&#x27; conduct was inexcusable. Fry stated that Buell regarded the actions as &quot;a gross violation of military discipline.&quot; Buell went on to telegraph General Henry Halleck, General in Chief of all Armies:

It was Major General Horatio G. Wright who came to Davis&#x27;s aid by securing his release and returning him to duty. Davis avoided conviction for the murder because there was a need for experienced field commanders in the Union Army. Fry stated in his journal of Wright&#x27;s comments,

Davis appealed to me, and I notified him that he should no longer consider himself in arrest... I was satisfied that Davis acted purely on the defensive in the unfortunate affair, and I presumed that Buell held very similar views, as he took no action in the matter after placing him in arrest.

Davis was released from custody on October 13, 1862. Military regulations required charges to be formally made against the accused within 45 days of the arrest. The charges never came possibly because larger events, such as the launching of Buell&#x27;s campaign in Kentucky five days later, overshadowed the Davis-Nelson affair.

====Aftermath====
There was no trial or any significant confinement since it appears that Davis was staying at the Galt House without guard, as based partly on Wright&#x27;s statement. Davis simply walked away and returned to duty as if nothing had ever happened.

===Western Campaign===

Davis was a capable commander, but because of the murder of Nelson, he never received a full promotion higher than brigadier general of volunteers. He, however, received a brevet promotion to major general of volunteers on August 8, 1864, for his service at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, and he was appointed commanding officer of the XIV Corps during the Atlanta Campaign, which he retained until the end of the war. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in the regular army on March 20, 1865.

During Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, Davis&#x27;s actions during the Ebenezer Creek passing and ruthlessness toward former slaves have caused his legacy to be clouded in continued controversy. As Sherman&#x27;s army proceeded toward Savannah, Georgia, on December 9, 1864, Davis ordered a pontoon bridge removed before the African-American refugees, who were following his corps, could cross the creek. Several hundred were captured by the Confederate cavalry or drowned in the creek while they attempted to escape.

==Postbellum career==

===Department of Alaska===
After the Civil War, Davis continued service with the army, becoming colonel of the 23rd Infantry Regiment in July 1866. In his capacity as commander of the newly created Military District of Alaska he was present at the transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States on October 18, 1867; and he was the first commander of the Department of Alaska from March 18, 1868, to June 1, 1870.

===Modoc War===
Davis gained fame when he assumed command of the US forces in California and Oregon during the Modoc War of 1872–1873, after General Edward Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas had been assassinated during peace talks. Davis&#x27;s presence in the field restored the soldiers&#x27; confidence after their recent setbacks against the Modoc. Davis&#x27;s campaign resulted in the Battle of Dry Lake (May 10, 1873) and the eventual surrender of notable leaders, such as Hooker Jim and Captain Jack.

===1877 general strike===
During the 1877 St. Louis general strike, Davis arrived in St. Louis, commanding 300 men and two Gatling guns, but refused on urging to quell strikers or run the trains. He stated that doing so would be beyond his orders to protect government and public property.

===Death===
Davis died in Chicago, Illinois, on November 30, 1879. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==In fiction==
Jefferson C. Davis is a character in the historical novel &quot;Forty-Ninth&quot; by Boris Pronsky and Craig Britton.

<text>Daniel Adam Lilker (born October 18, 1964) is an American musician best known as a bass player, but also guitarist, pianist, drummer, and vocalist. He has played bass in numerous heavy metal bands, including Anthrax, Nuclear Assault, S.O.D. and Holy Moses, and grindcore bands Brutal Truth and Exit-13.

==Biography==
Lilker was the bassist for the thrash metal band Nuclear Assault and was a founding member of Anthrax with Scott Ian. Lilker was then playing rhythm guitar and recorded bass guitar and co-wrote on their first album, &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; (1984). Not long after the release of that album, he was dismissed from Anthrax and replaced on bass by one of the band&#x27;s roadies Frank Bello. Despite this, Lilker has remained close to the band, receiving a co-writing credit for at least one song on their next two albums, &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; (1985) and &quot;Among the Living&quot; (1987), and he was offered to fill in for Bello on their spring 2024 tour dates.

In addition to Anthrax and Nuclear Assault, Lilker has played bass in grindcore band Brutal Truth and crossover band Stormtroopers of Death with Scott Ian and Charlie Benante (from Anthrax), and Billy Milano (Anthrax roadie, M.O.D. singer). He has also played bass with Exit-13, Malformed Earthborn, The Ravenous, Overlord Exterminator, Venomous Concept, Crucifist, Nokturnal Hellstorm, Nunfuckritual and Extra Hot Sauce.

During his tenure with Anthrax, Lilker played bass by fingerpicking, but since forming Nuclear Assault, he has mostly been using a pick.

Lilker played on Holy Moses&#x27; 1994 &quot;No Matter What&#x27;s the Cause&quot;. He is known for his fast, guitar-like riffing through heavy distortion. Lilker has been a columnist with Zero Tolerance Magazine since the publication&#x27;s inception in 2005. In 2009, it was reported that Chicago journalist Dave Hofer was writing a biography of Lilker.

Lilker formed United Forces with Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Billy Milano as their singer in 2012.

In January 2014, Lilker announced his plans to retire from being a full-time recording and touring musician. He also announced that Brutal Truth would break up on his 50th birthday. However, Lilker remained a member of Nuclear Assault, who released new material in 2015 for the EP &quot;Pounder&quot;, and had continued performing live sporadically until their breakup in 2022.

<text>Kirsten Storms (born April 8, 1984) is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Zenon Kar in the &quot;&quot; trilogy, Emily in &quot;Johnny Tsunami&quot;, and Bonnie Rockwaller in &quot;Kim Possible&quot;. Storms played Isabella &quot;Belle&quot; Black on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1999 to 2004. In 2005, Storms was cast as the character Maxie Jones on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and its spin-off &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Storms was born in Orlando, Florida and grew up in the Greater Orlando area, mainly Kissimmee, Casselberry and Sanford. She has a younger sister named Gretchen, a brother named Austin and a half-brother named Chris. She is the daughter of Karen Storms and CBS affiliate WCPX-TV (now WKMG-TV) sportscaster Mike Storms. According to Storms, she always knew she wanted to be a soap opera actress. At age five she announced:

After visiting her father at work, Storms convinced her parents to enroll her in acting classes, leading to her discovery by a talent scout at the age of five. The talent scout suggested she be enrolled in an intensive children&#x27;s acting camp in the Catskills, New York.

Storms&#x27; first role was a commercial for Galoob Baby Doll. After appearing in a handful of other commercials, her television career included a recurring role on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Second Noah&quot;, plus a lead role in &quot;Sing Me a Story with Belle&quot;. At age twelve, she moved with her family to Los Angeles, California. Soon after that, she landed the recurring role of Laura Cummings on The WB&#x27;s long-running program &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. She appeared in three episodes between 1998 and 2001, in which she played a girlfriend of Simon (played by David Gallagher). She was later chosen to play the title character in Disney Channel&#x27;s original movie &quot;&quot;. The movie had the largest rating for any Disney Channel original movie at the time. She later reprised the role in two sequels. Storms continued to appear in a string of family shows and television movies, including &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot;, a Hallmark production. She also took a supporting role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Tsunami&quot; and voiced Bonnie Rockwaller in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot;.

==Television==

===&quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;===
On August 5, 1999, Storms signed on to play Isabella &quot;Belle&quot; Black on the NBC daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Although she initially faced upset viewers at the sudden SORAS aging her casting brought to the character, Storms soon was popular with the audience. Her five years on the soap opera would feature her in many high-profile storylines, such as the popular relationship with Shawn Brady, played by Jason Cook, as Storms&#x27; character was promoted heavily as a major character within the show.

At the end of her five-year contract, Storms opted to not renew her contract with the series, one reason being her pilot had been picked up for the primetime show &quot;Clubhouse&quot;. Her final episode aired on July 16, 2004.

===&quot;Clubhouse&quot;===
&quot;Clubhouse&quot; was a primetime television series that aired on CBS starting the fall of 2004, created by Daniel Cerone and produced by Aaron Spelling. The series revolved around Pete Young (Jeremy Sumpter) and his dream of becoming a professional baseball player. Storms played Pete&#x27;s sister, Betsy. Unlike the innocent character of Belle that Kirsten had just left, Betsy was a rebellious teenager often finding herself in trouble over such issues as sex, drugs, and alcohol. Storms embraced the new role, stating, &quot;I can relate to a lot of things Betsy does. I&#x27;ve sat and talked with the executive producer about my first tattoo and the first time I ever had a drink of alcohol, things that she&#x27;s going to be experiencing too.&quot; The show was canceled after only five episodes aired. A total of 11 episodes were shot and later aired on Trio as part of its &quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot; series.

===&quot;General Hospital&quot;===
Storms returned to familiar territory on May 23, 2005, becoming the third actress to portray Mariah Maximiliana &quot;Maxie&quot; Jones on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 2008, Storms was reunited with Jason Cook, who joined the soap as Matt Hunter. She received an Emmy nomination for her role in 2009.

Storms vacated the role in fall 2011 for medical reasons, later revealed to be endometriosis. She was temporarily replaced with Jen Lilley, and originally scheduled to return to work in February 2012. Her illness prevented her from returning on time, and Lilley was kept on for the foreseeable future. In July 2012, it was announced that Storms would return to the series. On September 5, 2012, Storms reprised the role of Maxie on-screen. Storms took maternity leave on January 2, 2014, and returned on April 8 of the same year.

In March 2017, &quot;Soap Opera Spy&quot; reported that Storms was leaving the show for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. She returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in August 2017.

===Other work===
In 2015, Storms appeared as Selene Winterthorne in the soap opera web series &quot;Winterthorne&quot;.

==Personal life==
It was confirmed in early 2013 that Storms was in a relationship with her former &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Brandon Barash. In August 2013, the couple confirmed to &quot;People&quot; that they had secretly wed in June, and were expecting their first child, a girl, in January 2014. On January 7, 2014, Barash confirmed on his official Twitter account that Storms had given birth to a baby girl, Harper Rose Barash. On April 6, 2016, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; revealed that Storms and Barash had filed for divorce after more than two-and-a-half years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences, but they will raise their daughter together as they are splitting amicably.

Storms was pulled over on a Los Angeles freeway on September 7, 2007, by California Highway Patrol for tossing a lit cigarette out of the window of her Mercedes. She was arrested for a DUI following her failure at sobriety tests. Her blood alcohol content was measured at 0.13, above the California legal limit of 0.08. In November 2007, she pleaded no contest to the charges and was ordered to attend twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, complete a 90-day alcohol education program, and pay $1,643 in fines. She also had her license suspended for six months and was placed on three years&#x27; probation.

Storms is close friends with &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Kelly Monaco, who was featured in the short-lived E! reality show &quot;Dirty Soap&quot;, which aired during the fall of 2011.

<doc id="705820" wikidata="Q1332164" url="?curid=705820" title="Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire">
<text>Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire (19 August 1805 – 24 November 1895) was a French philosopher, journalist, statesman, and possible illegitimate son of Napoleon I of France.

== Biography ==
Jules was born in Paris. Marie Belloc Lowndes, in the second volume of her autobiography &quot;Where Love and Friendship Dwelt&quot; (1943), made claims regarding his paternity. He was reportedly ashamed of and did not talk about it. Lowndes did not say who his mother was.

In his early years he worked for the Ministry of Finance (1825–1828), and was an active journalist. From 1826 to 1830 he opposed the policies of Charles X of France in &quot;Le Globe&quot;. At the revolution of 1830 he signed the protestation of the journalists on 28 July 1830.

After 1830, he contributed to different newspapers, &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot;, &quot;Le National&quot; and &quot;Le Courrier français&quot; until 1833, when he gave up politics in order to devote himself to the history of ancient philosophy, undertaking a translation of Aristotle, which occupied him the greater part of his life. The reputation he gained from this work won him the chair of ancient philosophy at the Collège de France (1838) and a seat at the Academy of Moral and Political Science (1839).

After the revolution of 1848 he was elected as a republican deputy from the &quot;département&quot; of Seine-et-Oise. He was named by the Minister of Public Instruction, Carnot, head of the commission preparing the draft for the education reforms. However, after Carnot&#x27;s resignation and replacement by Alfred de Falloux, the commission was dissolved. Nevertheless, Barthélémy-Saint-Hilaire deposed to the National Assembly the report and the propositions written by the commission, which were ignored. After the May 1849 legislative election, won by the conservative Parti de l&#x27;Ordre, he was however re-elected and named again as a member of the parliamentary commission on education. During three years, he thus played an important role during the debates leading to the adoption of the Falloux Laws in 1850–1851, which greatly increased the clergy&#x27;s influence on education, to the dismay of Republicans such as Saint-Hilaire.

He was obliged to withdraw after the December 1851 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of Louis Napoleon. In 1855 he went as member of the international commission to Egypt to report on the possibility of the proposed Suez Canal, and by the articles which he wrote he contributed largely to making the project popular in France.

Elected deputy again in 1869, he joined the opposition to the Second Empire, and in 1871, as a member of the &quot;Centre gauche&quot; parliamentary group, bent all his efforts to the election of Thiers as President of the Republic, acting afterwards as his secretary. Appointed senator for life in 1875, he took his place among the moderate republicans (aka Opportunist Republicans), and from 23 September 1880 to 14 November 1881 was minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of Jules Ferry. The most important event of his administration was the annexation of Tunis under the form of a French protectorate, which he actively promoted.

In 1882 the village of St. Hilaire, Minnesota, in the United States, was named in his honor.

He died in Paris in 1895. His principal works, besides the translation of Aristotle and a number of studies connected with the same subject, are &quot;Des Védas&quot; (1854), &quot;Du Bouddhisme&quot; (1856) and &quot;Mahomet et le Coran&quot; (1865).

<text>Linda Tracey Ross (born February 27, 1959) is an American television actress, known for her role as Eve Russell on the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;Passions&quot; (1999–2008).

==Early life and education==
Ross was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood, New Jersey and then Douglass College.

== Career ==
In 1974, Ross&#x27;s victory in the Miss Black Teen-Ager of New Jersey contest helped launch her modeling career, which received a further boost from her 1978 win in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Look of Radiance contest. In 1984, she became the first winner in the Spokesmodel category on the television series &quot;Star Search&quot;, and the National Association of Theatre Owners named her &quot;Star of the Future&quot;. She later joined the cast of ABC daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; as Diana Douglas, appearing in show from 1985 to 1987. She later had a number of guest starring roles on prime time shows, such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Roc&quot;, &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot;, and &quot;Providence&quot;.

From 1999 to 2008, Ross starred as Eve Russell on the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;Passions&quot;. Ross was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series for nine consecutive years, for her performance as Eve Russell. Ross won the award on March 2, 2007.

== Personal life ==
During the mid-1980s Ross was in a relationship with Manhattan restaurateur Brad Johnson, with whom she had her only child, a son, rapper and singer Bryce Vine, born Bryce Christian Ross-Johnson in June 1988. That same month, Ross was one of four African-American “celebrity singles&quot;—the others being Patti Austin, Kashif, and Freddie Jackson—featured in &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, where they &quot;shar[ed] their secrets for living happily alone.&quot; Six months later, two of the four, namely Kashif and Ross (who had briefly dated in 1984), became husband and wife, reportedly on or very near the former&#x27;s 42nd birthday, December 26.

<doc id="705824" wikidata="Q651937" url="?curid=705824" title="John Bush (singer)">
<text>John Bush (born August 24, 1963) is an American heavy metal singer. He came to prominence in the 1980s as the lead singer and lyricist of Armored Saint, a heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California. In 1992, he joined thrash metal band Anthrax, with whom he remained until 2005 and briefly rejoined in 2009–2010. Bush has also been active with the reformed Armored Saint intermittently from 1999 to the present, and involved with other projects such as Metal Allegiance and Category 7.

Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic praised Bush&#x27;s &quot;remarkable voice&quot; while authors Howie Abrams and Sacha Jenkins ranked him as the eighth-best vocalist in the genre.

==Career==

Bush started his singing career at Woodrow Wilson High School (Los Angeles) in 1979, fronting a short-lived rock band called &quot;Royal Decree&quot;, with brothers Felipe &quot;Phil&quot; Sandoval (lead guitar) and Gonzalo &quot;Gonzo&quot; Sandoval (drums), and bassist Joey Vera, also Woodrow Wilson High School alumni. In 1982, they all became founding members of Armored Saint, along with new lead guitarist Dave Prichard, from South Pasadena High School.

In 1984, Bush had a cameo appearance in the Huey Lewis and the News video &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; at the 1:38 mark (exiting from the limo).

===1982–1992, 1999–present: Armored Saint===

Since their formation in 1982, Armored Saint has released eight full-length albums, one EP, a live album, a greatest hits compilation and two DVDs, all with Bush on vocals.

In the early 1980s, Bush was invited by Metallica to join them as lead singer. Even after the release of &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, Metallica vocalist James Hetfield felt unsure about his own singing abilities. Hetfield wanted to concentrate on his guitar and personally asked Bush to join Metallica. Bush was the only vocalist that the band considered as a potential frontman. He turned down the offer as he wanted to stay with Armored Saint. Bush states that part of his loyalty to Armored Saint came from the band being made up of his closest childhood friends.

In 1990, original Armored Saint guitarist Dave Prichard died of leukemia during the recording of &quot;Symbol of Salvation&quot;. Jeff Duncan replaced Prichard and the band finished the recording of &quot;Symbol of Salvation&quot;, going out on tour afterwards. Despite rave reviews from the metal press, the band decided that they did not want to continue without Prichard, and amicably disbanded.

In 1999, whilst Bush was a member of Anthrax, he got together with Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera. Together they decided to bring back the &quot;Symbol of Salvation&quot; lineup for an Armored Saint reunion. The resultant album &quot;Revelation&quot; was released in 2000 and a short tour followed. The following year, Armored Saint released a collection of demos, live tracks and other rarities in the two-disc package &quot;Nod to the Old School&quot;. They have since released three more studio albums, &quot;La Raza&quot; in 2010, &quot;Win Hands Down&quot; in 2015, and &quot;Punching the Sky&quot; in 2020.

===1992–2005, 2009–2010: Anthrax===
Following the 1992 dissolution of Armored Saint, Bush received a call from Scott Ian of Anthrax, who offered Bush the chance to fill the spot left behind by singer Joey Belladonna, who had been fired from the band. Bush accepted and joined the band, adding alternative rock sensibilities. Anthrax recorded &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;, &quot;Stomp 442&quot;, &amp; &quot;Volume 8: The Threat Is Real&quot; with Bush in the 90s before entering a temporary hiatus during 1999. Despite Bush&#x27;s reunion with Armored Saint during that same year, Bush remained a member of Anthrax. Returning to the band, Bush recorded vocals for his fourth album with the band, the critically acclaimed &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; in 2003. The successful WCFYA tour was documented with a live album/DVD titled &quot;Music of Mass Destruction&quot;. In 2004, Anthrax released &quot;The Greater of Two Evils&quot;, a re-recording of several of the band&#x27;s more popular songs from the pre-Bush era with the then-current lineup.

In early 2005, Anthrax issued a press release stating that the band&#x27;s &quot;Among the Living&quot; lineup was reuniting. Anthrax stated that Bush had not been fired, but with Joey Belladonna&#x27;s return and talk of a new album in the works, it was unclear if Bush would record with them again. However, Joey Belladonna&#x27;s exit from Anthrax in January 2007 fueled reports that Bush would return. However, Anthrax chose to recruit a new vocalist, Dan Nelson. In June 2007, Bush stated during an interview that he was not bitter about the split with Anthrax, revealing that they had asked him to take part in the reunion tour, which would have seen him and Belladonna splitting vocal duties, but that he turned it down because &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t right&quot; for him. He was later approached again by the band to re-join following Belladonna&#x27;s exit, which he again turned down, explaining: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go back and say, &#x27;Here I am...&#x27; It would be like coming in with my tail between my legs, and that&#x27;s not right for me. I just couldn&#x27;t do that. It just didn&#x27;t feel right to do that. It was about soul, your gut. How does that feel? Does it feel right? Good enough. Sold. Answer.&quot;

In August 2009, after Anthrax parted ways with their replacement singer Dan Nelson, Bush rejoined his former bandmates in Anthrax for a live performance on August 1, 2009, at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, England. Following this performance, there were many calls for him to return full-time. Bush also performed with Anthrax at the Loud Park &#x27;09 Festival in Japan on October 17, 2009, followed by five concerts on the Soundwave tour in Australia in February 2010.

On December 14, 2009, it was announced that the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash bands would play in Poland and Czech Republic during the following year, among several other shows during the Sonisphere festival. It was expected that Anthrax would continue with Bush, but the other members ultimately chose to reunite with Joey Belladonna, as Bush was not up for recommitting to the group full-time. The band has since toured and recorded again with Belladonna.

In September 2015, Bush caused some minor controversy after he went public concerning royalty issues with Anthrax, explaining: &quot;they&#x27;ve had a lot of — a lot — of accounting and management issues that were affecting me personally. Dan Spitz has an issue with the band [...] he feels like he hasn&#x27;t been paid by the band. And the dude made seven records with Anthrax. And the dude should be paid on those records that he made with the band. [...] It&#x27;s, like, I&#x27;m out there signing Anthrax records I made. I just wanna be paid for the records [that were] made and sold. And it gives me pride in those records. And then when you don&#x27;t [get paid], you become very bitter about it, and it&#x27;s not cool.&quot; He did reveal however that the band had a new accounting company and that &quot;they seem to be on the up and up now.&quot;

Nevertheless, he was forced to respond to his comments on Armored Saint&#x27;s Facebook page after fans criticised Anthrax for not paying Bush, admitting that &quot;In hindsight I would have preferred to keep this between myself and the members of Anthrax.&quot; and clarifying that he had received royalties from the band though they had been &quot;inconsistent&quot;, before declaring himself &quot;Done with this topic.&quot;

===2005–2019: Side projects===
Bush has done commercial voiceovers for the fast food chain Burger King.

In April 2011, German instrumental rock band Long Distance Calling released a self-titled full-length album, which features John Bush performing vocals for the track &quot;Middleville&quot;. &quot;Middleville&quot; is the only track with vocals on that album.

In December 2011, Metallica performed a 30th anniversary show with several guests, including Bush who joined Metallica onstage to perform &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, a song from &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; in which Bush took the lead vocal just as Hetfield had wanted him to do almost three decades prior. After the performance, drummer Lars Ulrich took the microphone to say &quot;It could have been a whole different story,&quot; then added in amazement at Bush&#x27;s performance: &quot;Wow!&quot;

Bush provided vocals for the 2013 action video game &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;. He is featured on the tracks &quot;Return to Ashes&quot; and &quot;The Hot Wind Blowing&quot;. Bush performed vocals for the track &quot;Bound by Silence&quot; from Metal Allegiance&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Volume II – Power Drunk Majesty&quot;. He appeared on the 2019 David Ellefson album &quot;Sleeping Giants&quot;, supplying lead vocals for the track &quot;If You Were God&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bush is married to Tori Lane and has a daughter and a son.

<text>The Washoe or Wašišiw (&quot;people from here&quot;, transliterated in older literature as &quot;Wa She Shu&quot;) are a Great Basin tribe of Native Americans, living near Lake Tahoe at the border between California and Nevada. The name &quot;Washoe&quot; or &quot;Washo&quot; (as preferred by themselves) is derived from the autonym (&quot;wa·šiw&quot; or &quot;wá:šiw&quot;) in the Washo language or from (&quot;waší:šiw&quot;), the plural form of wašiw.

==Territory==
Washoe people have lived in the Great Basin and the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains for at least the last 6,000 years, some say up to 9,000 years or more. Prior to contact with Europeans, the territory of the Washoe people centered around Lake Tahoe (; Washo: &quot;dáʔaw / daʔaw / Da ow&quot; – &quot;the lake&quot;; or &quot;dewʔá:gaʔa /dawʔa:gaʔa / Da ow aga&quot; – &quot;edge of the lake&quot;) and was roughly bounded by the southern shore of Honey Lake in the north, the West Walker River, Topaz Lake, and Sonora Pass in the south, the Sierra Nevada crest in the west, and the Pine Nut Mountains and Virginia Range in the east. Beside Lake Tahoe the Washoe utilized the upper ranges of the Carson (&quot;dá:bal k&#x27;iláʔam&quot;), Truckee (&quot;dabayóduweʔ&quot;), and West Walker rivers to the east as well the Sierra Valley (a site of extensive freshwater marshes filled with cattails, bulrushes and alkaline flats that drain into the Middle Fork Feather River) to the north. The Washoe would generally spend the summer in the Sierra Nevada, especially at Lake Tahoe; the fall in the ranges to the east; and the winter and spring in the valleys between them. Washoe Lake (&quot;c&#x27;óʔyaʔ dáʔaw&quot;) was named after them.

The Washoe/Washo were loosely organized into three (in some sources four) regional groups speaking slightly different dialects, which in turn were divided in groups (cooperating extending families for the seasonal hunt and living together in winter camps) and in nuclear families. The regional group was determined by where people had a winter camp:
* Welmelti (&quot;Northerners&quot; or &quot;Northern Washoe People&quot;)
* Pauwalu / Powalu (&quot;Easterners&quot; or &quot;Central Washoe People&quot;)
* Hungalelti (&quot;Southerners&quot; or &quot;Southern Washoe People&quot;) and,
* Tanalelti (&quot;Westerners&quot; or &quot;Western Washoe People&quot;)

Since the western part of the Washo territory was in the mountains and subject to heavy snows, few people wintered there so very few were organized into the western group.

==History==

Washoe people are the only Great Basin tribe whose language is not Numic, so they are believed to have inhabited the region prior to neighboring tribes. The Kings Beach Complex that emerged about 500 CE around Lake Tahoe and the northern Sierra Nevada are regarded as early Washoe culture. The Martis complex may have overlapped with the Kings Beach culture, and Martis pit houses gave way to conical bark slab houses of historic Washoe culture.

Washoe people may have made contact with Spanish explorers in the early 19th century, but the Washoe did not sustain contact with people of European culture until the 1848 California Gold Rush. Washoe resistance to incursions on their lands proved futile, and the last armed conflict with the Washoes and non-Indians was the Potato War of 1857, when starving Washoes were killed for gathering potatoes from a European-American farm near Honey Lake in California.

Loss of the valley hunting grounds to farms and the piñon pine groves to feed Virginia City&#x27;s demand for lumber and charcoal drove most Washoe to dependency on jobs on white ranches and farms and in cities. The areas where they settled became known as Indian colonies.
==Culture==

Piñon pine nuts gathered in the fall provided much of the food eaten in the winter. Roots, seeds, berries and game provided much of the food eaten during the rest of the year. The Washoe people were also deeply knowledgeable about their land and where resources were plentiful. This included an understanding of the seasonal cycles of both plants and animals. Wašiw people were also dependent on fishing at Lake Tahoe and the surrounding streams. Fishing was a huge part of Wašiw life; and each family had its own fishing grounds, until contact with Western civilization led to commercial fishing in the area, destroying another important resource for the Wašiw.

The Pine Nut Dance and girls&#x27; puberty rites remain very important ceremonies. The Wašiw people once relied on medicine men and their knowledge of medicinal plants and ceremonies. Much of this knowledge and activity has been lost due to contact with the Western world.

Washoe culture was based mostly on the legends that carried the explanation of different areas of life. The legends were handed over from one generation to another by storytelling and were told to younger generations to teach them basic things about Washoe&#x27;s way of living. Children could get to know about gathering techniques, medicine preparation, and the legends were meant to teach them how to appreciate the land they were living in and give them a better understanding of Washoe&#x27;s lifestyle. Children were raised in the environment which recognized family as the most valued thing. The whole Washoe life was concentrated on cooperation and unity, and older tribe members needed to convey their knowledge to the younger so the tribe culture would survive. Everyone in the family had his own role in everyday activities like fishing, gathering or hunting which helped Washoe people with doing everyday life tasks more efficiently.

=== Life cycle ===
The area of residence of Washoe people let them obtain food from three different ways: fishing, gathering, and hunting. Since each way required having special skills and knowledge people were usually trained in one field to reduce the possibility of failing the tasks they were responsible for. Therefore, the Washoe tribe&#x27;s life was dependent on the actual environment possibilities. Also, scarcity of sources would not let the tribe perform every way at once, therefore the Washoe lifestyle was divided into three periods: &quot;the fishing year&quot;, &quot;the gathering year&quot; and &quot;the hunting year&quot;.
* &quot;Fishing year&quot; – which came after the period of starvation, started in early spring as the snow in the mountains started to melt. At that time, some tribe members (mainly young men, boys, and sometimes unmarried women) left the winter camps and moved toward the Lake Tahoe to start the fishing season. By doing this they could save the leftovers from food reserves for people that had stayed in winter camps. They used caves and natural shelters as protection from the cold along with loin clothes and blankets made from rabbit skin to keep themselves warm. They fished for whitefish which some of them they consumed and some they carried back to winter camps so their folks could eat and gather strength for the return trip to the lake, which happened when it got warmer. It was the family&#x27;s decision when to leave the winter camps and go to Lake Tahoe and it depended on the condition and age of family members (family with infants or older people tend to leave the camps later than fitter members of the tribe. The whole Washoe tribe should have been returned to the Lake Tahoe shores by the beginning of June. Almost every tribe member was involved in fishing when the season came. The Washoe used the lake resources to the fullest and caught as many fish they could. They had learned how to preserve the fish drying it on the sun and made the food reserves for the future.
* &quot;Gathering year&quot; – could have been performed all year, but different ways of acquiring were used and the different type and amounts of food were provided. During winter the Washoe ate mostly the food they had gathered before the winter season started because very little vegetables could be found. As the spring came, more and more food became available. However, the food was limited over the place it was found and it could only feed a certain number of people, so tribe split up in smaller groups and went to look for food in different ways. The gathering was usually performed by women while men practiced fishing at the lake or hunting.
* &quot;Hunting year&quot; – started when the first animals appeared at the beginning of the spring. It was only men&#x27;s activity, so boys were trained from the youngest age. The Washoe tribe hunt for bigger animals like deer, bears or antelope as well as smaller ones: rabbits, birds, squirrels. The different techniques and times of hunting were adjusted for different types of animals.

Fall was the richest in food season of the year as all ways of obtaining the food could have been performed. The winter period was the time of starvation as the stocks of food run out quickly and almost no food could have been obtained over the coldest months of the year. However, Washoe people learned how to survive the hardest time of the year by learning how to use the resources the land had given them. They knew they needed to keep the balance as each way of obtaining food was equally crucial for these people to survive.

Anthropologist Ernestine Friedl has noted that men and women&#x27;s cooperation in gathering food lead to &quot;no individual distributions of food and relatively little difference in male and female rights,&quot; contributing to gender equality amongst the pre-colonial Washoe.

==Language==

The Washoe / Wašiw language or Wá:šiw ʔítlu (today: Wašiw Wagayay) has been regarded as a language isolate, However, it is sometimes tentatively regarded as part of the controversial Hokan language family. The language is written in the Latin script.

The Wašiw language is now considered a moribund language as only a handful of fluent elder speakers use the language. There has been a recent revival of the language and culture within the Tribe. &quot;Wašiw Wagayay Maŋal&quot; (the &quot;house where Wašiw is spoken&quot;) was the first attempt by the Wašiw people to renew their language for the future generations. The tribe currently relies on the tribal Cultural Resource Department to provide language classes to the community. However, there has recently been a pedagogical shift within the tribe, and the youth have become the focal point of language and culture programs.

== Washoe Tribe and Lake Tahoe ==
The Washoe people are considered to be the indigenous inhabitants of Lake Tahoe area, occupying the lake and surround lands for thousands of years. As the native inhabitants, they believe that they have the best knowledge of how the land should be maintained, and consider themselves to be the proper caretakers of the Lake Tahoe area, which has been a center Washoe tribes yearly cultural gatherings, where most traditional events took place. In 2002, The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources officially granted custody to the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California over the land around the Lake Tahoe area for cultural purposes.

==Washoe tribes==
* Reno-Sparks Indian Colony
* Susanville Indian Rancheria
* Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California

Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the colonies in the Carson Valley area of Nevada and California gained federal recognition as the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California. The colony in Reno, Nevada, which also has a substantial Paiute, Washoe and Shoshoni population, gained separate recognition as the Reno–Sparks Indian Colony. There is evidence that some Washoe settled in the southwest region of Montana. The Susanville Rancheria includes Washoe members, as well as Northern Paiute, Northeastern Maidu, Achomawi, and Atsugewi members.

<text>Sir James David Wolfensohn (1 December 193325 November 2020) was an Australian-American lawyer, investment banker, and economist who served as the ninth president of the World Bank Group (1995–2005). During his tenure at the World Bank, he is credited with the focus on poverty alleviation and a rethink on development financing, earning him recognition as a banker to the world&#x27;s poor. In his other roles, he is credited with actions that brought Chrysler Corporation back from the brink of bankruptcy, and also improving the finances of major United States cultural institutions, including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. He served two terms as President of the World Bank on the nomination of U.S. President Bill Clinton, and thereafter held various positions with charitable organizations and policy think-tanks including the Brookings Institution.

He was born in Sydney, Australia, and was a graduate of the University of Sydney and Harvard Business School; he was also an Olympic fencer. He worked for various companies in Britain and the United States before forming his own investment firm. Wolfensohn became an American citizen in 1980 and renounced his Australian citizenship, although he eventually regained it in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Wolfensohn was born on 1 December 1933 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His father Hyman, known as Bill, was born in London to Austrian-Jewish immigrants, while his mother Dora was born in Belgium to Polish parents. His father was a &quot;highly intelligent but failed businessman&quot; who had previously worked for the Rothschild banking family. Wolfensohn&#x27;s parents arrived in Australia in 1928. He was named after James Armand de Rothschild, his father&#x27;s former employer, whose birthday he shared. His mother sang with Australian radio and gave him piano lessons, instilling in him a love of the symphony. In high school, he was noted to have taken part in operas, including playing female roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.

Wolfensohn grew up in a two-bedroom flat in Edgecliff. His father struggled financially, and in his autobiography, &quot;A Global Life&quot;, Wolfensohn described how monetary insecurity was a fact of life from childhood and explained that he was always looking for a cushion to protect himself from it. Wolfensohn attended Woollahra Public School, and then Sydney Boys High School. He entered the University of Sydney at the age of 16, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Laws (LLB). In 1959 he earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School. In his 2010 memoirs he revealed that he failed several university classes, including English, and was a &quot;late developer&quot;.

Wolfensohn was a member of the Australian fencing team at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, participating in the Men&#x27;s Team Épée and an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force.

==Business career==
Before attending Harvard, Wolfensohn was a lawyer in the Australian law firm of Allen, Allen &amp; Hemsley in Sydney (now Allens). Upon graduating from Harvard Business School, Wolfensohn worked briefly for Swiss cement giant Holderbank (now Holcim). He also worked for an air-conditioner company requiring him to travel across India, Nigeria, Greece, Mexico, Latin America, and other developing countries. He wrote in his memoir about the poverty and inequity, &quot;The inequity was so striking that I could hardly absorb what was in front of me. I had known what to expect intellectually, but, the reality was a shock. It left an indelible mark that would influence my later life.&quot;

He then returned to Australia, where he worked for various banking institutions, including Darling &amp; Co. In the late 1960s, he became a director of Darling&#x27;s major shareholder J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co, a London-based investment bank. He was a senior executive in the London office before becoming managing director of the bank&#x27;s New York City office from 1970 to 1976. He later became a senior executive at Salomon Brothers. In 1979, together with Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s then chief executive officer Lee Iacocca and then President of the New York Fed Paul A. Volcker, who later became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Wolfensohn helped orchestrate the rescue of Chrysler from the verge of bankruptcy. In what has been described as the largest corporate bailout at that time, in addition to his banking skills he is noted to have played a role in smoothening a cultural rift between Lee Iacocca and Japanese Bankers, who went on to invest more than $600 million in the company.

In 1980, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, after it was rumored that he was a candidate to succeed Robert McNamara as president of the World Bank. He renounced his Australian citizenship at this time. He next established his own investment firm, James D. Wolfensohn, Inc., along with partners including Paul Volcker. Upon accepting his nomination to serve as president of the World Bank in 1995, Wolfensohn divested of his ownership interest in James D. Wolfensohn, Inc. The firm was later bought by Bankers Trust. The firm had a diverse client which included Ralph Lauren Corporation and Mercedes-Benz.

During the 1980s and 1990s, he was the chairman of the Carnegie Hall and later of the Kennedy Center. At both of these places, he is credited with stabilizing the cultural organizations&#x27; finances and managing their budget shortfalls. At the Kennedy Center he pushed for a shift in programming toward &quot;crowd pleasing&quot; programs including Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Cats&quot;. Clashes with this approach prompted staff like the artistic director Marta Istomin to quit in 1990.

In 2005, upon stepping down as president of the World Bank, he founded Wolfensohn &amp; Company, LLC, a private firm that works with governments and large corporations doing business in emerging markets. He was also the chairman of the International Advisory Board of Citigroup. In 2009, he became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.

==World Bank tenure and other public service==

Wolfensohn became the ninth president of the World Bank on 1 July 1995 after he was nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton. He was unanimously supported by the bank&#x27;s board of executive directors for a second five-year term in 2000, becoming the third person to serve two terms in the position after Eugene R. Black and Robert McNamara. He visited more than 120 countries around the world during his term as president. Speaking of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, he said, &quot;China never borrowed less than $3 billion a year during my tenure. They were the most significant client&quot;. He believed that the People&#x27;s Republic of China sought to obtain know-how in addition to money from the Bank, with the People&#x27;s Republic going from a net borrower to holding over two and a half trillion in foreign exchange reserves.  

Wolfensohn is credited, with among other things, having been the first World Bank president to bring attention to the problem of corruption in the area of development financing. His reforms during his time at the World Bank earned him recognition as a champion of the world&#x27;s poor. He is credited for reforms at the World Bank, including decentralization, technology investments, and moves towards openness. In June 1996, he wrote a memo that spot audits would occur after he established an in-house auditing staff at the World Bank. His time at the Bank was also a period of shift from complex infrastructure projects in developing economies to social-sector led programs. During this time, the World Bank became one of the largest funders of global primary education and health programs including HIV/AIDS programs. He also advanced debt release programs for many Africa and Latin American nations.

He brought attention to contemporary Africa when he hosted the award-winning visual artist Ibiyinka Alao during the show &quot;Visions and Vignettes&quot; presented by the World Bank Art Program.

On 3 January 2005, Wolfensohn announced he would not seek a third term as president. During his term, the Alfalfa Club named him as their nominee for President of the United States in 2000 as part of a long-standing tradition, despite being constitutionally ineligible due to the natural-born citizen clause in Article II of the United States Constitution. He served as an advisor to the Grassroots Business Fund.

==Mideast envoy==
In April 2005, Wolfensohn was appointed special envoy for Gaza disengagement by the Quartet on the Middle East, a group of major powers and the United Nations promoting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He resigned after 11 months as special envoy when he understood the United States government to be undermining his efforts and firing his staff.

According to him the major blame for the failure of his Middle East mission lay with him. &quot;I feel that if anything, I was stupid for not reading the small print,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I was never given the mandate to negotiate the peace.&quot; Former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, would succeed him in this role.

==Civic and charitable activities==
In 2006, Wolfensohn founded the Wolfensohn Center for Development at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank. The centre examined how to implement, scale up, and sustain development interventions to solve key development challenges at a national, regional, and global level and strove to bridge the gap between development theorists and practitioners. Its projects focused on youth exclusion in the Middle East, large-scale anti-poverty programs, reforms of global economic governance, and regional cooperation, particularly in Central Asia. The Center concluded work after five years.

Wolfensohn was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, and also served as an honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution. He was a trustee and past chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He was chairman emeritus of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and also of the Carnegie Hall in New York City. He was a member of the non-profit think tank the Council on Foreign Relations. In July 2008, Wolfensohn was selected as one of the inaugural fellows of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. He served on the board of various charitable foundations, including the Wolfensohn Family Foundation.

Between 1985 and 2015 Wolfensohn attended 27 conferences of the Bilderberg Group, which rendered him one of the most frequent participants of the organization during this time period. He also attended meetings of the Aspen Institute and the World Economic Forum. He was a one time a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. In 2004, Wolfensohn was the commencement speaker at Brandeis University. Wolfensohn sat on the board of Endeavor (non-profit). He was a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee.

==Personal life==
Wolfensohn married Elaine Botwinick, sister of IT entrepreneur Edward Botwinick, in 1961. They had three children and seven grandchildren. Botwinick died in August 2020, three months before Wolfensohn&#x27;s death.

In New York City, he once found himself at a Jerusalem Foundation lunch next to Dorothy de Rothschild, widow of James. She could not tell him why his father suddenly had left Rothschild six decades earlier. But he was reassured that his father had been a &quot;wonderful man&quot;.

Wolfensohn began cello studies with Jacqueline du Pré, a friend, at the age of 41 when she offered to teach him on the condition that he perform on his 50th birthday at Carnegie Hall in New York City, which he did. He repeated the exercise on his 60th and 70th birthdays with Yo-Yo Ma and Bono. He continued to play and appeared, together with musician friends, at private events at Carnegie Hall and elsewhere.

In October 2010, he regained his Australian citizenship, that he had renounced earlier. Wolfensohn was a resident of Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Wolfensohn died on 25 November 2020 in Manhattan of complications from pneumonia, aged 86, six days short of his 87th birthday.

==Honours==

Wolfensohn received numerous awards throughout his life. He became an honorary officer of the Order of Australia in 1987, received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1993, and an honorary knighthood of the Order of the British Empire in 1995 for his service to the arts. The University of New South Wales conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Science on him in 2006, and he received the Award of Excellence from The International Center in New York.

In 2006, Wolfensohn received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice. In 2011, he was awarded the Golden Biatec Award, the highest award bestowed by Slovakia&#x27;s Informal Economic Forum – Economic Club, for his contribution to addressing global priorities. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Wolfensohn was inducted into the Olympians for Life project.

He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

<text>Christopher John Weitz (; born November 30, 1969) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, and actor. He is best known for his work with his brother Paul on the comedy films &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;About a Boy&quot;; the latter earned the Weitz brothers a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Among his other main works, Weitz directed the film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and the film adaptation of &quot;New Moon&quot; from the series of &quot;Twilight&quot; books, wrote the screenplay for Disney&#x27;s 2015 live-action adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and co-wrote &quot;Rogue One&quot; with Tony Gilroy.

== Early life ==
Weitz was born in New York City, the son of actress Susan Kohner and Berlin-born novelist/menswear designer John Weitz. His brother is filmmaker Paul Weitz. Weitz is the grandson of Czech-born agent and producer Paul Kohner and actress Lupita Tovar on his maternal side. Tovar, who was from Oaxaca, Mexico, starred in &quot;Santa&quot;, Mexico&#x27;s first talkie, in 1932, as well as a Spanish language version of &quot;Drácula.&quot; Weitz&#x27; paternal grandparents escaped Nazi Germany, before which his grandfather was a successful textile manufacturer, with the family being intimates of writer Christopher Isherwood and actress Marlene Dietrich.

Weitz&#x27;s father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, whereas his maternal grandmother was Catholic; he was raised in a nonreligious household. He has also described himself as a &quot;lapsed Catholic crypto-Buddhist.&quot;

As a young boy, Weitz attended Allen-Stevenson School with his brother and was a member of the Knickerbocker Greys, a long-standing New York City youth marching corps that has been in existence since 1881.

When he was 14 years old, Weitz went to the boarding school St Paul&#x27;s School in London, which his father had attended. He graduated with a degree in English from Trinity College, Cambridge.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1998–2006) ===
Weitz&#x27; early career involved many collaborations with his brother. Some of the work they have done as screenwriters has been both credited and uncredited.

Weitz began his film career as a co-writer on the animated film &quot;Antz&quot; (1998). He followed this with work on various sitcoms such as &quot;Off Centre&quot; and the 1998 revival of the 1977 TV series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In 1999, he and Paul directed and produced &quot;American Pie&quot;, which was written by Adam Herz, and became a major box office success. Weitz returned as executive producer on the film&#x27;s two theatrical sequels. In 2001, along with his brother, he co-directed his second film, the Chris Rock comedy &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

In 2002, the Weitz brothers co-wrote and co-directed &quot;About a Boy&quot;, the Hugh Grant film based on the book by Nick Hornby. The film was originally set up at New Line Cinema with Robert De Niro producing, and the main character as an American. The brothers felt that it was important that the character is British. Inspiration came from the 1960 film &quot;The Apartment.&quot; They were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Weitz has produced a number of films including &quot;In Good Company&quot; and &quot;American Dreamz&quot;, both of which were directed by his brother, Paul.

=== &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (2007) ===
In 2003, Weitz was hired to direct New Line Cinema&#x27;s adaptation of the first book in Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, after approaching the studio with an unsolicited 40-page treatment. He was subsequently invited by director Peter Jackson to visit the set of &quot;King Kong&quot;, in order to gain insight into directing a big-budget film and advice on how to deal with New Line. In 2005, Weitz announced his departure from the film, citing the enormous technical challenges involved, and the fear of being denounced by both the book&#x27;s fans and detractors; he was subsequently replaced by British director Anand Tucker. Tucker left the project in 2006 over creative differences with New Line, and Weitz returned to the director&#x27;s chair after receiving a letter from Pullman asking him to reconsider.

During post-production, New Line had Weitz&#x27;s editor replaced, and the studio made the final cut with severe differences from Weitz&#x27;s vision, trimming the originally unhappy ending and watering down the religious theme. Weitz stated:
::It was a terrible experience because I was able to shoot what I wanted to — and then the cut of the movie was taken away from me and any reference to religion or religious ideas was removed. And the darkness and threat at the end of the story — anything that made it not a happy, popcorn-type movie — was removed. The voice of the key character was redone, all of this against my will. And the fact of the matter is the people that the studio was afraid were going to raise up arms against the movie did it anyway.

The film was released in 2007 and was met with mixed reviews. Its U.S. grosses have been described as disappointing in relation to film&#x27;s US$180 million budget, although it was a &quot;stellar performer&quot; outside the U.S. with a &quot;stunning&quot; box office likely to hit $250 million. When questioned about a possible sequel, New Line studio co-head Michael Lynne said that &quot;The jury is still very much out on the movie...&quot; The second and third screenplays have been written but because of the economic recession and the protest by the Catholic Church, the two sequels never got made and was later rebooted into a television series that was released in 2019. Its worldwide box office gross stands at $372,234,864.

=== &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; (2009) ===
In December 2008, Weitz was announced as the director of the sequel to &quot;Twilight,&quot; the film adaptation of the novel &quot;New Moon&quot; by Stephenie Meyer. Weitz said he felt a tremendous sense of responsibility to live up to the expectations of the passionate fan base.

&quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; opened in November 2009, one year after the first movie was released. &quot;New Moon&quot; set records as the biggest midnight opening in domestic box office history, grossing an estimated $26.3 million in 3,514 theaters, previously held by &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.&quot; The film grossed $72.7 million on its opening day domestically, becoming the biggest single-day opening in domestic history, beating the $67.2 million tally of &quot;The Dark Knight.&quot;. This opening strongly contributed to another record: the first time that the top ten films at the domestic box office had a combined gross of over $100 million in a single day.

The opening weekend of &quot;New Moon&quot; was the third-highest opening weekend in US domestic history with $142,839,137, and the sixth-highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. With an estimated budget of just under $50 million, &quot;New Moon&quot; is the least expensive movie to ever open to more than $200 million worldwide. Over Thanksgiving weekend, the film grossed $42.5 million, and including Wednesday and Thursday ticket sales it grossed $66 million. It earned $230.7 million in its first ten days, $38 million more than the previous installment grossed in its entire theatrical run. Internationally, the film grossed roughly $85 million over Thanksgiving weekend, adding up to a total worldwide gross of $473.7 million in ten days. Weitz decided not to continue to direct the next film in the franchise.

=== Other projects ===
In June 2011, Summit Entertainment released his film &quot;A Better Life,&quot; written by Eric Eason about a Hispanic gardener and his son in Los Angeles searching for their stolen truck. This film is unusual among Hollywood productions in that it is set in a Hispanic community and features an almost entirely Hispanic cast. Weitz said that working on the film allowed him to explore his Hispanic heritage—his grandmother is from Mexico—and learn Spanish. The film was nominated for an Oscar.

In 2012, he worked with journalist Jose Antonio Vargas on a series of four documentary shorts directed by Weitz called &quot;Is This Alabama?&quot;, about the effects of the state of Alabama&#x27;s anti-immigration legislation, 2011&#x27;s Alabama HB 56. The project was a collaboration between Weitz, Vargas, the Center for American Progress think-tank, America&#x27;s Voice Education Fund, and Vargas&#x27; Define American campaign, with Vargas doing the interviews.

Weitz wrote the screenplay for Disney&#x27;s 2015 live-action adaptation of &quot;Cinderella,&quot; which was released in theaters on March 13, 2015. Weitz said he went back to the many different versions of the story (Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, as well as the 1950 animated Disney original) as well as his own vision.

Weitz scripted the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; stand-alone film, director Gareth Edwards&#x27; &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016). Replacing Gary Whitta, Weitz shared writing duties with Tony Gilroy. In 2017, Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe co-wrote the script for Fox 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Mountain Between Us&quot;, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, by Charles Martin.

Weitz will be writing the screen adaptation of &quot;21 Years to Midnight,&quot; a movie about same-sex marriage documented in the legal case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;.

Weitz directed &quot;Operation Finale&quot;, a 2018 MGM historical drama thriller film, written by Matthew Orton, about the Mossad and Shin Bet teams that captured Adolf Eichmann. The film starred Oscar Isaac, Ben Kingsley, Lior Raz, Mélanie Laurent, Nick Kroll, and Joe Alwyn.

=== Acting ===
Weitz has also occasionally worked as an actor, playing the lead role in the 2000 comedy film &quot;Chuck &amp; Buck&quot; and a bland suburbanite in &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;.

=== In development ===
Weitz has a production company with his brother Paul Weitz and producer Andrew Miano called Depth of Field. In March 2016, Weitz and his brother signed a two-year first look deal with Amazon Studios.
* A live-action adaptation Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric saga, which Weitz said he enjoyed as a child. Weitz&#x27;s Depth of Field production company was meant to create the films as a potential trilogy for Universal Pictures. In a May 2007 interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine he announced that he had met with Moorcock, who trusted him with the films, and described his wish for Paul to direct the film.
* &quot;Shield of Straw&quot; – producing an English remake of the 2013 Japanese action thriller, &quot;Shield of Straw&quot;
* &quot;Ghost Train&quot; – producing a remake of the 2006 Japanese horror film, &quot;Soul Reviver&quot;
* &quot;Birthright&quot; – producing a remake of the 2010 Japanese thriller
* &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; – writing an adaptation of a remake of the 2013 Japanese drama for Steven Spielberg
* &quot;Sinatoro&quot; – producing TV series with Grant Morrison for Universal Television

== Author ==
Weitz wrote a young adult novel trilogy series that began with &quot;The Young World,&quot; in 2014, and was followed by &quot;The New Order,&quot; in 2015 and &quot;The Revival&quot; in 2016. The series follows a group of teenagers struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world where a disease killed off all adults over the age of 18.

Weitz said that he used the concept of natural intelligence theories called Society of Mind created by Marvin Minsky to create the stories that were loosely autobiographical about growing up in New York City.

== Personal life ==
Weitz is married to Mercedes Martinez, who is Cuban Mexican, and with whom he has one son, Sebastian Weitz and a daughter, Athena Weitz. Weitz said he met Martinez at the Burning Man festival.

In 2004, Weitz was a co-investor with Paul Devitt in the Japanese restaurant and club called Tokio on N. Cahuenga in Los Angeles.

On November 11, 2016, after Donald Trump won the presidential election, Weitz tweeted, &quot;Please note that the Empire is a white supremacist (human) organization.&quot; Although he had apologized and deleted the tweet, several Trump supporters have used the hashtag #DumpStarWars and claimed that &quot;Rogue One&quot; contained an anti-Trump scene.
