<text>Charles Robert Maturin, also known as C. R. Maturin (25 September 1780 – 30 October 1824), was an Irish Protestant clergyman (ordained in the Church of Ireland) and a writer of Gothic plays and novels. His best known work is the novel &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, published in 1820 which made a great impact on writers such as Balzac, Baudelaire and Poe.

==Early life==
Maturin was descended from Huguenot émigrés who left France and found shelter in Ireland in the anti-Protestant persecution which followed the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in the late seventeenth century. One of these descendants was Gabriel Jacques Maturin, who became Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin after Jonathan Swift in 1745. Charles Robert Maturin was born in Dublin and attended Trinity College. Shortly after being ordained as curate of Loughrea, County Galway, in 1803, he moved back to Dublin as curate of St Peter&#x27;s Church. He lived in York Street with his father William, a Post Office official, and his mother, Fedelia Watson, and married on 7 October 1804 the acclaimed singer Henrietta Kingsbury. On 7 October 1803, Maturin and Kingsbury were involved in a marriage settlement, in which Maturin was noted as living in Banagher in the King&#x27;s County (modern-day County Offaly) at the time.

In January 1805, Maturin acted as a witness to a deed in which his father William signed a lease taking on a property on the &quot;south&quot; side of York Street, Dublin for 50 years from one &quot;James Switsir of the City of Kilkenny&quot;. The transaction had been made &quot;in Consideration of the Sum of £500 to (Switsir) partly paid, and partly secured to be paid, by William Maturin&quot;. In March 1805, William sub-leased the same property to a &quot;Patrick Sharkey, Doctor of Physic&quot;, and in May 1805 took out another lease on a separate property on the north side of &quot;Fitzwilliams Street&quot;, Dublin. Further property dealings were made in subsequent years by William Maturin concerning property on Lower Mount Street, Dublin.

In a deed of assignment from August 1810, William assigned to his son Charles a property on the &quot;north&quot; side of York Street, &quot;in Consideration of the sum of £900 to him in hand paid by said Charles [..] and in Consideration of being released from a sum of £500 then due on foot of a mortgage therein recited.&quot; This may be evidence of Charles having released his father from the earlier Switsir lease of 1805. The deed went on to further clarify that Charles Maturin &quot;did thereby for himself, his Executors, Administrators and Assigns for Ever remise, release and Discharge the said William Maturin of, and from, the therein and hereinbefore mentioned sum of £500 due on the Mortgage [..] and from all Interest due, and to grow due, thereon&quot;. The £900 that Charles paid to his father was in fact trust money from his marriage settlement, which his trustees legally advanced to him in a &quot;Deed of Trust&quot; dated 1 August 1810.

Maturin registered a &quot;Deed of Annuity&quot; between himself and a &quot;Catherine Rhames of the City of Dublin, Widow&quot; in August 1812 in which it specified Rhames was to receive one annuity of fifty pounds seven shillings and three pence sterling &quot;for and during the Natural life of the said Charles Robert Maturin, payable half yearly [..] over and above all deductions whatsoever, at the Royal Exchange in the City of Dublin or at such other place or places in the said City as She or they shall Appoint for that purpose.&quot; It is unclear who the woman was, or what her relationship with Maturin had been.

== Works ==
His first three works were Gothic novels published under the pseudonym Dennis Jasper Murphy, and were critical and commercial failures. They did, however, catch the attention of Sir Walter Scott, who recommended Maturin&#x27;s work to Lord Byron. With their help, Maturin&#x27;s play &quot;Bertram&quot; was staged in 1816 at the Drury Lane for 22 nights, with Edmund Kean starring in the lead role as Bertram. Financial success, however, eluded Maturin, as the play&#x27;s run coincided with his father&#x27;s unemployment and another relative&#x27;s bankruptcy, both of them assisted by the fledgling writer. To make matters worse, Samuel Taylor Coleridge publicly denounced the play as dull and loathsome, and &quot;melancholy proof of the depravation of the public mind&quot;, going nearly so far as to decry it as atheistic.

The Church of Ireland took note of these and earlier criticisms and, having discovered the identity of &quot;Bertram&quot;″s author (Maturin had shed his &quot;nom de plume&quot; to collect the profits from the play), subsequently barred Maturin&#x27;s further clerical advancement. Forced to support his wife and four children by writing (his salary as curate was £80-90 per annum, compared to the £1000 he made for &quot;Bertram&quot;), he switched back from playwright to novelist after a string of his plays met with failure. He produced several novels in addition to &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, including some on Irish subjects and &quot;The Albigenses&quot;, a historical novel which features werewolves. Various poems have also been ascribed to Maturin on dubious grounds and appear to be the work of others. The prize-winning &quot;Lines on the Battle of Waterloo&quot; was published in 1816 under the name of the university graduate John Shee. &quot;The Universe&quot; appeared with Maturin&#x27;s name on the title page in 1821, but is now thought to be almost completely the work of James Wills.

The exaggerated effectiveness of Maturin&#x27;s preaching can be gauged from the two series of sermons that he published. On the occasion of the death of Princess Charlotte, he declared: &quot;Life is full of death; the steps of the living cannot press the earth without disturbing the ashes of the dead – we walk upon our ancestors – the globe itself is one vast churchyard.&quot; A contemporary account records that there had seldom been seen such crowds at St Peter&#x27;s. &quot;Despite the severe weather, people of all persuasions flocked to the church and listened spellbound to this prince of preachers. In his obituary it was said that, &#x27;did he leave no other monument whereon to rest his fame, these sermons alone would be sufficient&#x27;.&quot;

Maturin died in Dublin on 30 October 1824. A writer in the &quot;University Magazine&quot; was later to sum up his character as &quot;eccentric almost to insanity and compounded of opposites – an insatiable reader of novels; an elegant preacher; an incessant dancer; a coxcomb in dress and manners.&quot;

In July 1834, a decade after his death, the &quot;Christian Examiner, and Church of Ireland Magazine&quot; praised the late Rev. Maturin, declaring that &quot;his five sermons on the errors of the Roman Catholic Church have been considered masterpieces&quot; and that &quot;they attracted, in the course of their delivery, extraordinary crowds, and derive(d) an additional and melancholy interest from the fact of their being [..] the last sermons that man of eloquence and genius ever composed&quot;. The periodical lamented the fact that Maturin had spent so much of his lifetime writing novels and plays and not enough time advancing the Protestant religion, &quot;of which he was... so bright and so able an advocate&quot;.

==International reputation==
In 1821 Maturin&#x27;s successful play was adapted into French as &quot;Bertram, ou le Pirate&quot; by Charles Nodier and Baron Isidore Justin Séverin Taylor, and ran successfully for 53 nights in the following year. This version was the source for the even more successful opera &quot;Il pirata&quot;, with a libretto by Felice Romani and music by Vincenzo Bellini, premiered at La Scala of Milan in 1827. Victor Hugo admired the play and Alexandre Dumas based his &quot;Antony&quot; upon its hero in 1831. The play was also printed and frequently produced in the United States.

The novel &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; was also published in French translation in 1821 and served as an influential model for writers in France. In 1835 Honoré de Balzac wrote a parody, &quot;Melmoth Reconcilié&quot;, in which Maturin&#x27;s hero goes to Paris, where he finds in its banking world an ethos that &quot;has replaced the principle of honour by the principle of money&quot; and easily finds someone to accept damnation in his place. In Balzac&#x27;s eyes, &quot;this novel is taken up with the same idea to which we already owe the drama of &quot;Faust&quot; and out of which Lord Byron has cut his cloth since &quot;Manfred&quot;&quot;. Charles Baudelaire was also an admirer of Maturin&#x27;s novel, equating it with the poetry of Byron and Edgar Allan Poe.

==Family connections==
A sister of Maturin&#x27;s wife married Charles Elgee, whose daughter Jane Francesca became the mother of Oscar Wilde. Thus Charles Maturin was Oscar Wilde&#x27;s great-uncle by marriage. Wilde discarded his own name and adopted the name of Maturin&#x27;s novel, Melmoth, during his exile in France.

Maturin&#x27;s eldest son, William Basil Kingsbury Maturin, followed him into the ministry, as did several of his grandsons. One of these, Basil W. Maturin, died in the sinking of in 1915. The second son was Edward Maturin, who emigrated to the United States and became a novelist and poet there.

William Maturin (1803–1887), a Tractarian, was the Church of Ireland priest at Grangegorman and also librarian of Archbishop Marsh&#x27;s Library, Dublin, from 1872 until 1887.

<doc id="704238" wikidata="Q986635" url="?curid=704238" title="Priority right">
<text>In patent law, industrial design law, and trademark law, a priority right or right of priority is a time-limited right, triggered by the first filing of an application for a patent, an industrial design or a trademark respectively. The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same invention, design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must claim the priority of the first application in order to make use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his &quot;successor in title&quot;.

The period of priority, i.e., the period during which the priority right exists, is usually 6 months for industrial designs and trademarks and 12 months for patents and utility models. The period of priority is often referred to as the priority year for patents and utility models.

In patent law, when a priority is validly claimed, the date of filing of the first application, called the priority date, is considered to be the effective date of filing for the examination of novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness for the subsequent application claiming the priority of the first application. In other words, the prior art which is taken into account for examining the novelty and inventive step or non-obviousness of the invention claimed in the subsequent application would not be everything made available to the public before the filing date (of the subsequent application) but everything made available to the public before the priority date, i.e. the date of filing of the first application.

== Rationale ==

According to the European Patent Office, &quot;basic purpose [of the right of priority] is to safeguard, for a limited period, the interests of a patent applicant in his endeavour to obtain international protection for his invention, thereby alleviating the negative consequences of the principle of territoriality in patent law.&quot;

== Types ==

=== Convention priority right ===

The &quot;Paris Convention priority right&quot;, also called &quot;Convention priority right&quot; or &quot;Union priority right&quot;, is a &quot;priority right&quot; under a multilateral arrangement, defined by Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883. The Convention priority right is probably the most widely known priority right. It is defined by its Article 4 A.(1):

Article 4 B. of the Paris Convention describes the effects of the priority right:

Article 2 paragraph 1 of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) in conjunction with the Paris Convention provides a &quot;derived&quot; Convention priority right. That is, while WTO members need not ratify the Paris Convention, they should however comply with Articles 1 through 12, and Article 19, of the Paris Convention.

=== Priority rights under other multilateral arrangements ===
Some priority rights are defined by a multilateral convention such as the European Patent Convention (EPC) or the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The Paris Convention does not cover priorities claimed in a European patent application or in an international application (or PCT application), as the EPC and the PCT have their own legal provisions regarding priority.

==== European Patent Convention ====

 defines the priority right system under the EPC or more precisely recognise priority rights for first filings in or for States party to the Paris Convention or any Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO):

 describes the effect of the priority right:

As explained by the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO) in its decision G 3/93 of August 16, 1994 (Reasons 4):

Regarding the critical question &quot;What is &#x27;the same invention&#x27;?&quot; in , opinion G 2/98 prescribes a photographic approach to the assessment of priority. According to Enlarged Board of Appeal opinion G 2/98, the requirement for claiming priority of &quot;the same invention&quot; means that priority of a previous application in respect of a claim in a European patent application is to be acknowledged only if the skilled person can derive the subject-matter of the claim directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, from the previous application as a whole.

==== Patent Cooperation Treaty ====

The Patent Cooperation Treaty, in its Article 8(1), provides the possibility of claiming a right of priority for the filing of an international application (PCT application):
 goes on to mention that:
However, Rule 4.10(a) as amended with effect from January 1, 2000 does not apply to all designated Offices. For instance, for the European Patent Office as designated Office, the old Rule 4.10(a) still applied until December 12, 2007, that is, rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member not party to the Paris Convention were not recognised. Now and more specifically for European patent applications filed on or after December 13, 2007 (the entry into force of the new version of the European Patent Convention, the so-called EPC 2000), the rights of priority of first applications made in a WTO member are recognized under the European Patent Convention.

=== Internal priority rights ===
Some priority rights, called &quot;internal priority rights&quot;, are defined by some national laws. Such internal priority right allows an applicant who filed a first application in a given country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a subsequent application in the same country.

The Paris Convention does not cover internal priority rights. See, e.g., provisional application in the US.

=== Priority rights under bilateral agreements ===
Some priority rights also exist on the basis of bilateral agreements. A bilateral agreement between a first and a second country may allow an applicant who filed an application in the first country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a second application in the second country. These kinds of bilateral agreements usually involve at least one country not party to the Paris Convention.

== Special considerations ==

=== Partial priority for patent claims ===
The extent to which a partial priority can be acknowledged for a single claim in a patent application or patent -i.e., only for a part of the claim, for which the subject-matter is disclosed in the priority document- is a delicate question. Decision G 1/15 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO deals specifically with this question.

=== Extension of the priority period in case of official holidays and other &quot;closed&quot; days ===
The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883 provides for that, if the last day of the 12-month priority period &quot;is an official holiday, or a day when the Office is not open for the filing of applications in the country where protection is claimed&quot;, the priority period is extended &quot;until the first following working day&quot;.

<text>Charles Henry Dyson (August 2, 1909 – March 14, 1997) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was founder of the Dyson Kissner-Moran Corporation (founded in 1954) and the Dyson Foundation (founded in 1957).

==Business career==
Dyson began his career in 1932 as an accountant at Price Waterhouse &amp; Company. After a two-year tour as a chartered accountant in England with Price Waterhouse &amp; Company, Dyson was rewarded by being named a manager when he returned to the United States in 1938. He remained with the company until he was recruited to government service for the Lend Lease Program. After the war, he returned to the business world as the Executive Vice President of Finance of the Textron Corporation under its founder, Royal (Roy) Little. In 1949, he moved to Burlington Mills Corporation where he served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer under President Spencer Love. In 1954, he founded the Dyson Corporation (now Dyson Kissner-Moran Corporation), a private investment firm specializing in acquisitions and mergers.

==Military career==
Dyson was recruited by the Federal government as a civilian to help set up the procurement and record keeping for the Lend Lease Program. At the U.S. declaration of World War II, he was drafted into the same position as a lieutenant in the Army Air Force. During his military service, the War Department assigned him to the Treasury Department to assist the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr. and Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The UNMFC was created to set the post-war exchange rates for world currencies, principally the dollar, franc, pound, and the German mark. For his diverse and distinguished service, Dyson was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

==Charitable interests==
In 1957, Dyson and wife Margaret Dyson (1914–1990) created the Dyson Foundation, one of the wealthiest charities in the United States. In 2004, the foundation had approximately $295,000,000 in assets and awarded over $16.3 million in grants.

A 1930 graduate of New York&#x27;s Pace University (then the Pace Institute), Dyson has been a generous benefactor for his alma mater. The Dyson College of Arts and Sciences at Pace University and &quot;Dyson Hall&quot; in Pleasantville, NY, are named in his honor.

There is a Margaret M. and Charles H. Dyson Atrium at Cornell University in Sage Hall, part of the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management and a Margaret M. and Charles H. Dyson Center at Marist College, which houses the School of Management and the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences.

In June 2010, Cornell University received a $25 million donation from the Dyson family which would be used to make improvements to the university&#x27;s School of Applied Economics and Management. In Dyson&#x27;s honor, the department was renamed the Charles Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. In addition, some of the funds would also go towards scholarships.

He was one of the people listed on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List in 1971 (he was listed as #5).

He was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 1973.

==Personal life==
Dyson and his wife, Margaret MacGregor Dyson, had four children, John Stuart (b. 1943), Robert Richard (b. 1946), Anne Elizabeth (b. 1947), and Peter Lawrence (b. 1951).

<doc id="704254" wikidata="Q1351064" url="?curid=704254" title="Paul Grimault">
<text>Paul Grimault (; 23 March 1905 – 29 March 1994) was one of the most important French animators. He made many traditionally animated films that were delicate in style, satirical, and lyrical.

His most important work is &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;oiseau&quot;, which ultimately took over 30 years to produce. He began it as &quot;La Bergère et le Ramoneur&quot; (&quot;The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep&quot;) in 1948 and it was highly anticipated, but Grimault&#x27;s partner André Sarrut showed the film unfinished in 1952, against Grimault&#x27;s wishes. This caused a rift between partners and a stop in production. In 1967, Grimault got possession of the film and subsequently was able to complete it in 1980 under a new title, &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;oiseau,&quot; incorporating some footage from the original and re-hiring the original animators, together with some new, younger ones. There are many names for it in English that have been used in various releases, including: &quot;The King and the Bird&quot; (literal), &quot;The King and the Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird&quot; and &quot;The King and Mr. Bird&quot; (1980).

He also collected his best shorts in a retrospective compilation movie, &quot;La table tournante&quot; (1988), which is included in the deluxe edition of &quot;Le Roi et l&#x27;oiseau.&quot; For a detailed bibliography, see this reference.

== Les Gémeaux ==
In 1936 Grimault founded, with André Sarrut, &quot;Les Gémeaux,&quot; which was the second significant French animation venture, following the work of Émile Cohl, which had closed years earlier. During World War II, American films being unavailable, its films found a captive audience. The studio produced a number of shorts, then closed its doors in 1952 following the expense of making &quot;La Bergère et le Ramoneur,&quot; which was the first feature-length French animated movie.

== Other work ==
Grimault was part of the agitprop group Groupe Octobre. At this group he met Jacques Prévert, with whom he went on to collaborate on several animated films, most notably &quot;Le roi et l&#x27;oiseau.&quot;

<text>Robert Alton Harris (January 15, 1953 – April 21, 1992) was an American car thief, burglar, kidnapper and murderer who was executed at San Quentin State Prison in 1992 for the 1978 murders of two teenage boys in San Diego. His execution was the first in the state of California since 1967.

Harris was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was abused as a child. He had run-ins with police as early as age 10, and was first placed into juvenile detention at age 13 for stealing a car. His mother abandoned him at age 14 and he was soon after placed into juvenile detention after stealing another car. Following his release he found work, married, and had a son. In 1975 he was imprisoned for manslaughter and paroled in January 1978.

On July 5, 1978, Harris and his younger brother commandeered a car occupied by two 16-year-old boys, John Mayeski and Michael Baker, ordered them to drive to a remote area, then killed them. The brothers then used the car as their getaway car when they robbed a bank in San Diego. He was arrested less than an hour after the robbery and charged with murder, auto theft, kidnapping, burglary, and bank robbery. One of the arresting officers, Steve Baker, was the father of one of the murdered boys, but did not realize the victim was his son until later. Harris was convicted and sentenced to death on March 6, 1979. After a series of appeals and stays of execution, he was executed in San Quentin&#x27;s gas chamber on April 21, 1992.

==Early life and criminal record/history==
Robert Alton Harris was born at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the fifth of nine children of Kenneth and Evelyn Harris. Kenneth was a sergeant in the United States Army who was awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his service in World War II. Both parents were alcoholics, and Robert reportedly was born two months premature as a result of Kenneth kicking Evelyn in the abdomen; Robert is also reported to have suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome. Robert was especially targeted for abuse by his father, who believed that Robert was conceived in an affair. The Harris family moved to Visalia, California in 1962 following Kenneth Harris&#x27; discharge from the Army. Kenneth Harris was jailed in 1963 for 18 months and again for a longer period of time in 1964, both times for sexually abusing his daughters. With Kenneth in jail, the remaining family members lived a migrant life around the San Joaquin Valley.

Robert spent four months in juvenile hall at age 13 for stealing a car. During his time at the juvenile detention centre, Harris was repeatedly raped. In 1967, Evelyn abandoned Robert, then 14, in Sacramento and left him to fend for himself. After making his way to Oklahoma to live with his brother and sister, he stole a car and was subsequently arrested in Florida. He spent the next three years in the Florida juvenile detention system, but when he turned 19, the system could no longer keep him, and he was sent to Chula Vista, California. In June 1973 Harris married, and the couple had a son, Robert Jr., born in October 1974. In 1975 while living in a trailer park in Imperial County, Harris beat his brother Ken&#x27;s roommate, James Wheeler, to death, claiming he did so to protect the victim&#x27;s wife; however, it was later determined that he beat the victim without provocation. He was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and imprisoned in San Luis Obispo; during his imprisonment Harris&#x27; wife filed for divorce. Harris was paroled in January 1978.

==San Diego murders==
Sometime in May or June 1978, Robert, then aged 25, asked his brother Daniel, 18, for help in planning a bank robbery. On July 2, Daniel stole two guns from a neighbor&#x27;s house in Visalia, California, and the two drove to San Diego that night. They spent the next two days purchasing ammunition and practicing the robbery in a rural area near Miramar Lake.

On July 5, the Harris brothers happened upon John Mayeski and Michael Baker, both 16, sitting in a green Ford LTD eating cheeseburgers in a supermarket parking lot in Mira Mesa. Mayeski and Baker were best friends who had planned to spend the day fishing to celebrate Mayeski&#x27;s newly acquired driver&#x27;s license. Robert Harris commandeered Mayeski&#x27;s car and ordered him to drive to Miramar Lake, with Daniel Harris following in another vehicle. Robert Harris told the boys that they would be using the vehicle to rob a bank, but that no one would be hurt. At Miramar Lake, the Harris brothers ordered the boys to kneel, whereupon the boys began to pray. Robert told the boys to &quot;Quit crying, and die like men&quot;, then shot both boys multiple times. The Harris brothers then returned to Robert&#x27;s Mira Mesa home and allegedly finished the victims&#x27; half-eaten cheeseburgers while Robert boasted about the killings.

About an hour later, the Harris brothers robbed the Mira Mesa branch of the San Diego Trust and Savings Bank located across the street from where they had abducted Mayeski and Baker, and fled with about $2,000. A witness to the robbery followed the Harrises to their home and notified police. The Harris brothers were arrested less than an hour after the robbery. One of the officers who apprehended the Harris brothers was Steven Baker, father of victim Michael Baker, who at the time was unaware that his son had been killed, let alone by one of the men he was arresting.

==Conviction and execution==

The San Diego County District Attorney&#x27;s Office filed felony charges of auto theft, kidnapping, murder and burglary against Robert Harris, while the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office filed bank robbery charges against him. Harris pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bank robbery and received a 25-year sentence.

On March 6, 1979, Robert Harris was convicted in the San Diego County Superior Court of two counts of murder in the first degree with special circumstances as well as two counts of kidnapping, and was sentenced to death. Daniel Harris was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to six years in state prison; he was released in 1983. An appeal for clemency to California governor Pete Wilson – who was mayor of San Diego at the time of the killings – was rejected in a live television news conference, where Wilson read a statement acknowledging Harris&#x27; abusive childhood but ended with a clear rejection of the clemency request, saying, &quot;As great as is my compassion for Robert Harris the child, I cannot excuse or forgive the choice made by Robert Harris the man.&quot; Wilson then left without waiting for reporters&#x27; questions.

Harris&#x27; death sentence was affirmed by the Supreme Court of California in 1981. In 1982, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relieving Harris of the death sentence, vacating a contrary district court order. The Supreme Court of the United States reimposed Harris&#x27; death sentence in &quot;Pulley v. Harris&quot; (1984), reversing the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 7–2.

In 1990, federal appeals court judge John T. Noonan Jr. issued a stay of execution, as Harris argued that childhood brain damage interfered with his judgment during his crimes.

Harris was scheduled to die on April 21, 1992. On April 18, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel issued a temporary restraining order barring Harris&#x27; execution while she considered his lawsuit challenging the gas chamber&#x27;s constitutionality. A three member panel of the Ninth Circuit issued an emergency writ of mandate vacating the restraining order, in which Judge Arthur Alarcón was joined by Judge Melvin T. Brunetti, over the dissent of Judge Noonan.

On April 20, the U.S. Supreme Court had vacated a separate stay of execution the Ninth Circuit had issued on Harris&#x27; habeas corpus petition. That evening, a group of Ninth Circuit judges ordered the execution stayed while the circuit considered granting en banc consideration of his lawsuit. Later that evening, the Ninth Circuit entered a third stay blocking the execution while it reconsidered reimposing the lower court&#x27;s temporary restraining order. That night, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a per curiam decision vacating the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s stays and allowing the execution to proceed, by a vote of 7–2.

On April 21, 1992, at 3:49 a.m., Harris was strapped into the gas chamber. Seconds before execution, Ninth Circuit Judge Harry Pregerson stayed the execution for the fourth time, explaining that Harris should be allowed to begin a new lawsuit in state court. Two hours later, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that stay, explicitly ordering that &quot;No further stays of Robert Alton Harris&#x27; execution shall be entered by the federal courts except upon order of this Court.&quot;

Harris was executed on April 21, 1992, in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison – the first execution in California in 25 years. For his last meal, he had requested and was given a 21-piece bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, two large Domino&#x27;s pizzas, a bag of jelly beans, a six-pack of Pepsi, and a pack of Camel cigarettes. At 6:01 a.m., he was escorted into the gas chamber. The execution order was given at 6:07 a.m. By 6:14 a.m. he had ceased moving and was declared dead seven minutes later.

The execution is specifically remembered for his choice of final words (recorded by Warden Daniel Vasquez): &quot;You can be a king or a street sweeper, but everybody dances with the grim reaper.&quot; It was the subject of a 1995 Dutch documentary film, &quot;Procedure 769, witness to an execution&quot;. His words are based on the 1991 film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; as &quot;You might be a king or a little street sweeper but sooner or later you dance with the reaper&quot;; the lyric was written by actor William Sadler for his character in the 1991 film.

<doc id="704266" wikidata="Q418183" url="?curid=704266" title="Dicofol">
<text>Dicofol is an insecticide, an organochlorine that is chemically related to DDT. Dicofol is a miticide that is very effective against spider mite. Its production and use is banned internationally under the Stockholm Convention.

One of the intermediates used in its production is DDT. This has caused criticism by many environmentalists; however, the World Health Organization classifies dicofol as a Level II, &quot;moderately hazardous&quot; pesticide. It is known to be harmful to aquatic animals, and can cause eggshell thinning in various species of birds.

== Difference between dicofol and DDT ==

Dicofol is structurally similar to DDT. It differs from DDT by the replacement of the hydrogen (H) on C-1 by a hydroxyl (OH) functional group. One of the intermediates used in its production is DDT.

== Chemistry ==

Dicofol is usually synthesized from technical DDT. During the synthesis, DDT is first chlorinated to an intermediate, Cl-DDT, followed by hydrolyzing to dicofol. After the synthesis reaction, DDT and Cl-DDT may remain in the dicofol product as impurities.

* Formula: C14H9Cl5O
* Chemical names: 2,2,2-Trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol
* Appearance: Pure dicofol is a white crystalline solid. Technical dicofol is a red-brown or amber viscous liquid with an odor like fresh-cut hay.
* Solubility: It is stable under cool and dry conditions, is practically insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. Solubility: 0.8 mg/L (25 °C) in water.
* Melting Point: 78.5 - 79.5 °C for pure dicofol, 50 °C for technical dicofol
* Vapor Pressure: Negligible at room temperature
* Molecular Weight: 370.49 g/mol
* Partition Coefficient: 4.2788
* Adsorption Coefficient: 5000 (estimated)

== Impurities ==

Manufacturing-use dicofol products contain a number of DDT analogs as manufacturing impurities. These include the o,p&#x27; and p,p&#x27; isomers of DDT, DDE, DDD, and a substance called extra-chlorine DDT or Cl-DDT

== Use and formulations ==

Foliar spray on agricultural crops and ornamentals, and in or around agricultural and domestic buildings for mite control. It is formulated as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, ready-to-use liquids, and aerosol sprays. In many countries, dicofol is also used in combination with other pesticides such as the organophosphates, methyl parathion, and dimethoate.

== Producers ==

Dicofol first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, and was introduced onto the market by the US-based multinational company Rohm &amp; Haas in 1957. Other current manufacturers include Hindustan Insecticides Limited (India), Lainco (Spain), and ADAMA Agricultural Solutions (Formerly Makhteshim-Agan) (Israel). It is sold under a number of trade names, including &quot;Hilfol&quot;, &quot;Kelthane&quot; and &quot;Acarin&quot;.

In 1986, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) temporarily canceled the use of dicofol because relatively high levels of DDT contamination were ending up in the final product. Modern processes can produce technical grade dicofol that contains less than 0.1% DDT.

== Estimated usage as a pesticide ==

The Pesticide Survey, USA 1987 through 1996, reports that the total annual domestic agricultural usage of dicofol averaged about 860,000 pounds active ingredient (a.i.) for about treated. Most of the area is treated with 2 pounds a.i. or less per application, and the average acre is treated with about 1.2 pounds a.i. per year (1.3 kg/(ha·yr)). Fruits tend to have the highest application rates.
The largest markets for dicofol in terms of total pounds active ingredient are cotton (over 50%) and citrus (almost 30%). Although only about 4% of the cotton acres grown are treated with dicofol, over 60% of all crop acres treated with dicofol are cotton acres. The remaining usage is primarily on other fruits and vegetables. Most of the US usage is in California and Florida.

== Effects ==

The California Department of Food and Agriculture has one of the world&#x27;s most extensive incident reporting systems. Between 1982 and 1992, 38 incidents involving dicofol alone were reported: systemic 19 (50%); skin 10 (26%); eye 8 (21%); and eye/skin 1 (3%). The number of incidents per 1,000 applications for all illnesses ranged from 0.11 to 0.21.

The US National Pesticides Telecommunications Network database collected reports from 1984 to 1991 showing 91 human, 9 animal and 31 other poisoning incidents for a total of 131 incidents involving dicofol from 571 phone calls made to the hotline.

An assessment of dicofol by the UK Pesticides Safety Directorate in 1996 found that residues in apples, pears, blackcurrants and strawberries were higher than expected.

There is no established US maximum contaminant level (MCL) or health advisory levels for residues of dicofol in drinking water. In the European Union, the maximum level is the same for all active ingredients 0.1 mg/L.

In 1990, the use of dicofol was suspended in Sweden for environmental reasons. In Switzerland its use is permitted for research purposes only. Throughout the European Union dicofol containing more than lg/kg (0.1%) of DDT or DDT related compounds cannot be used.

The 1998 US EPA review of dicofol recommended a number of changes in order to protect the environment and wildlife. Dicofol applications are limited to no more than one per year. In the UK, the maximum number of treatments permitted is two per year for apples and hops, and two per crop for strawberries, protected crops and tomatoes.

In 1980, an accident at the US Tower Chemical Company led to a release of dicofol into Lake Apopka in Florida. Ten years later Dr Guillette of Florida University linked this incident to a subsequent decline in the fertility of alligators in the lake. The US EPA is still not clear whether dicofol is involved in the reproductive failure of the alligator population following the accidental spill.

== Toxicity ==

It is classified by the World Health Organisation as a Class II, &#x27;moderately hazardous&#x27; pesticide.

The acute oral for dicofol is 587 mg/kg for rats.

Dicofol is a nerve poison. The exact mode of action is not known, although in mammals it causes hyperstimulation of nerve transmission along nerve axons (cells). This effect is thought to be related to the inhibition of certain enzymes in the central nervous system.

Symptoms of ingestion and/or respiratory exposure include nausea, dizziness, weakness and vomiting; dermal exposure may cause skin irritation or a rash; and eye contact may cause conjunctivitis. Poisoning may affect the liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. Very severe cases may result in convulsions, coma, or death from respiratory failure.

Dicofol can be stored in fatty tissue. Intense activity or starvation may mobilize the chemical, resulting in the reappearance of toxic symptoms long after actual exposure.

== Chronic effects ==

Tests on laboratory animals show that the primary effects after long term exposure to dicofol include increases in liver weight and enzyme induction in the rat, mouse and dog.

There are also effects relating to altered adrenocorticoid metabolism (part of the hormonal system). In the rat hormonal changes were accompanied by the histological observation of vacuolation (empty cavities) of the cells of the adrenal cortex.

== Carcinogenecity ==

The US EPA has classified dicofol as a Group C, possible human carcinogen. There is limited evidence that it may cause cancer in laboratory animals, but there is no evidence that it causes cancer in humans. This classification was based on animal test data that showed an increase in the incidence of liver adenomas (benign tumour) and combined liver adenomas and carcinomas in male mice.

== Reproductive effects ==

Reproductive effects in rat offspring have been observed only at doses high enough to also cause toxic effects on the livers, ovaries, and feeding behavior of the parents. Rats fed diets containing dicofol through two generations exhibited adverse effects on the survival and/or growth of newborns at 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day

* Teratogenic effects: No teratogenic effects are observed when rats were given up to 25 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 15 of pregnancy
* Mutagenic effects: Laboratory tests have shown that dicofol is not mutagenic
* Endocrine disruption: Evidence for dicofol to cause endocrine disruption is suggestive, but not definitive

A 2007 study by the California Department of Public Health found that women in the first eight weeks of pregnancy who live near farm fields sprayed with dicofol and the related organochloride pesticide endosulfan are several times more likely to give birth to children with autism. These results are highly preliminary due to the small number of women and children involved and lack of evidence from other studies.

== Metabolism ==

Dicofol is converted in rats to the metabolites 4,4&#x27;-dichlorobenzophenone and 4,4&#x27;-dichlorodicofol.
Studies of the metabolism of dicofol in rats, mice, and rabbits have shown that ingested dicofol is rapidly absorbed, distributed primarily to fat, and readily eliminated in feces. When mice were given a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg dicofol, approximately 60% of the dose was eliminated within 96 hours, 20% in the urine, and 40% in the feces. Concentrations in body tissues peaked between 24 and 48 hours following dosing, with 10% of the dose found in fat, followed by the liver and other tissues. Levels in tissues other than fat declined sharply after the peak.

== Ecological effects ==

Effects on birds: Dicofol is slightly toxic to birds. The 8-day dietary LC50 is 3010 ppm in bobwhite quail, 1418 ppm in Japanese quail, and 2126 ppm in ring-necked pheasant. Eggshell thinning and reduced offspring survival were noted in the mallard duck, American kestrel, ring dove, and screech owl.

Effects on aquatic organisms: Dicofol is highly toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, and algae. The LC50 is 0.12 mg/L in rainbow trout, 0.37 mg/L in sheepshead minnow, 0.06 mg/L in mysid shrimp, 0.015 mg/L in shell oysters, and 0.075 mg/L in algae.

Effects on other organisms: Dicofol is not toxic to bees.

== Degradation ==

Breakdown in soil and groundwater: Dicofol is moderately persistent in soil, with a half-life of 60 days. Dicofol is susceptible to chemical breakdown in moist soils. It is also subject to degradation by UV light. In a silty loam soil, its photodegradation half-life was 30 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions, the half-life for dicofol was 15.9 days.

Dicofol is practically insoluble in water and adsorbs very strongly to soil particles. It is therefore nearly immobile in soils and unlikely to infiltrate groundwater. Even in sandy soil, dicofol was not detected below the top in standard soil column tests. It is possible for dicofol to enter surface waters when soil erosion occurs.

Breakdown in water: Dicofol degrades in water or when exposed to UV light at pH levels above 7. Its half-life in solution at pH 5 is 47 to 85 days. Because of its very high absorption coefficient (Koc), dicofol is expected to adsorb to sediment when released into open waters.

Breakdown in vegetation: In a number of studies, dicofol residues on treated plant tissues have been shown to remain unchanged for up to 2 years.

<doc id="704268" wikidata="Q1022326" url="?curid=704268" title="C and D-class destroyer">
<text>The C and D class was a group of 14 destroyers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. As in previous years, it was originally intended to order a complete flotilla comprising eight destroyers—plus a flotilla leader as the ninth unit—in each year. However, only four ships—plus a leader—were ordered under the 1929–1930 Programme as the C class. The other four ships planned for the C class were never ordered as an economy measure and disarmament gesture by the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald. A complete flotilla—the &#x27;D&#x27; class—was ordered under the 1930–1931 Programme.

The five ships of the C class were assigned to Home Fleet upon their completion, although they reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia of 1935–1936 and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. They were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1937–1939 and spent most of their time during World War II on convoy escort duties in the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Fraser&quot; (formerly &quot;Crescent&quot;) was sunk when she was accidentally rammed by the British cruiser HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot; in 1940. &quot;Ottawa&quot; (formerly &quot;Crusader&quot;) was sunk by a German submarine in 1942, though she had sunk an Italian submarine in 1940. The other ships of the class sank three German submarines during the war. They were all worn out by the end of the war and were scrapped in 1946–1947.

The D-class destroyers were initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning, but were transferred to the China Station in 1935. Like the C class, most were temporarily deployed in the Red Sea when the Italians invaded Abyssinia, but returned to the China Station when that was over. They were still there when the war began, but reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards. Five ships were transferred to Home Fleet in December 1939, but &quot;Duchess&quot; was sunk en route when she was accidentally rammed by the battleship HMS &quot;Barham&quot;, and &quot;Duncan&quot; was badly damaged when she collided with a merchant ship, requiring lengthy repairs. &quot;Daring&quot; was sunk by a German submarine in February 1940. The other two participated in the Norwegian Campaign of April–June, but &quot;Delight&quot; was sunk by German aircraft in July and &quot;Diana&quot; was transferred to the RCN as a replacement for the &quot;Crescent&quot; after she was sunk by the cruiser &quot;Calcutta&quot;. However, she too was rammed and sunk several months later by a freighter that she was escorting.

The four ships that remained with the Mediterranean Fleet sank three Italian submarines in 1940 while escorting Malta convoys and larger warships of the fleet. Several participated in the Battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento that year. &quot;Duncan&quot; joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and escorted that group. &quot;Dainty&quot; was sunk by German bombers in February 1941 and &quot;Diamond&quot; in April while evacuating Allied personnel from Greece. &quot;Defender&quot; had to be scuttled in July when she was crippled by a German bomber when returning from escorting a convoy to Tobruk. &quot;Duncan&quot; and &quot;Decoy&quot; remained on escort duties for the rest of the year before being transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942. They returned to the UK late in the year to begin conversions to escort destroyers. &quot;Decoy&quot; was transferred to the RCN in early 1943, but both became convoy escorts in the Atlantic. They sank two German submarines before being assigned to the UK to protect Allied shipping during Operation Overlord. They sank three more submarines before the end of the war and were paid off in 1945. &quot;Duncan&quot; was scrapped in 1945 and &quot;Decoy&quot; during 1946.

==Design and description==
These ships were based on the preceding B class, but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director-control tower for British destroyers. The &#x27;C&#x27; class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and wheelhouse separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and ASDIC (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked ASDIC and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C&#x27;s, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and ASDIC.

The C- and D-class destroyers displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers that operated at a pressure of and a temperature of . The destroyers carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . Their complement was 145 officers and ratings.

, leader of the C class, displaced more than her destroyers and carried an extra 30 personnel who formed the staff of the Captain (D), commanding officer of the flotilla. Unique among the C and D-class ships, she had three Yarrow water-tube boilers that operated at a pressure of . , leader of the &#x27;D&#x27; class, displaced more than her destroyers and also carried an extra 30 personnel.

All of the ships of the class mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt AA gun between her funnels. The C-class ships carried two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of their forecastle deck. The D-class destroyers had been intended to carry the new QF 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mk III machine gun in quadruple mountings on the bridge wings, but these were not initially available, so the old 2-pounder guns were retained in &quot;Daring&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;. The 3-inch AA gun was removed in 1936–37, and the 2-pounders were relocated between the funnels on platforms The ships were fitted with two above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes.

The main guns were controlled by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data derived from the director and the rangefinder. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye.

When purchased by Canada in 1937–38, the four C-class destroyers were refitted to meet Canadian specifications, including the installation of Type 124 ASDIC. It is not clear how much &quot;Kempenfelt&quot; had been modified when she was turned over in October 1939, other than steam heating had yet been fitted.

===Wartime modifications===
Beginning in May 1940, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed and replaced with a QF 12-pounder Mk V anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun&#x27;s field of fire. Four to six QF 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to the surviving ships, usually replacing the 2-pounder or .50-calibre machine gun mounts between the funnels. One pair of these was added to the bridge wings and the other pair was mounted on the searchlight platform. Early in the war, depth charge stowage increased to 33 in the C class, while the D class carried 38. &#x27;Y&#x27; gun on the quarterdeck was removed on many ships to allow for additional depth charge stowage as was the 12-pounder. On at least one ship, this latter gun replaced &#x27;X&#x27; gun. Most ships had either &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, although &quot;Duncan&quot; retained both and received a split Hedgehog that was mounted on either side of &#x27;A&#x27; gun. Some ships that received the Hedgehog in &#x27;B&#x27; position also mounted two old QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns for use against U-boats at very close range.

Most ships had their director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge removed in exchange for a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast.

==Ships==


==Service==

All five of the C class were assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet upon commissioning during 1932. Following the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the entire flotilla was sent to the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, they were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–37 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. &quot;Crescent&quot; and &quot;Cygnet&quot; were sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1937 and &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Crusader&quot; in 1938. &quot;Kempenfelt&quot; was bought in 1939, but the Royal Navy did not turn her over until enough auxiliary anti-submarine ships had been commissioned to replace her after World War II had started. All four &#x27;C&#x27;-class ships were stationed at Esquimalt in British Columbia when the war began, but only &quot;Fraser&quot; and &quot;St. Laurent&quot; were immediately recalled to begin convoy escort duties on the Atlantic Coast, the other two following in November. &quot;Assiniboine&quot; was sent to the Caribbean for local escort duties in December where she assisted in the capture of the blockade runner in March 1940. &quot;Fraser&quot;, &quot;St. Laurent&quot;, and &quot;Restigouche&quot; were transferred to the UK in late May and helped to evacuate refugees from France. &quot;Fraser&quot; was sunk on 25 June 1940 in a collision with the anti-aircraft cruiser in the Gironde estuary while the other two were assigned to the Western Approaches Command for escort duties.

The remaining ships spent most of the rest of the war escorting convoys in the North Atlantic, based in either Canada or the UK. &quot;Ottawa&quot; assisted the British destroyer in sinking the on 7 November 1940. She was sunk by the on 14 September 1942 while escorting Convoy ON 127. &quot;St. Laurent&quot; had her first victory on 27 December 1942 when she was credited with sinking while defending Convoy ON 154. Together with the destroyer , and the frigates and , she sank . While escorting Convoy SC 94 on 3 August 1942, &quot;Assiniboine&quot; rammed and sank . &quot;Restigouche&quot; never sank a submarine, but she and &quot;St. Laurent&quot; were transferred to the UK to protect the shipping mustering for Operation Overlord in May 1944 and &quot;Assiniboine&quot; followed in July. They saw some action against German patrol boats in the Bay of Biscay, but &quot;Restigouche&quot; and &quot;St. Laurent&quot; were in poor shape by this time and were sent back to Canada for lengthy refits in late 1944. They remained in Canada after the completion of their refits in early 1945, while &quot;Assiniboine&quot; remained in the UK until June. All three ships transported Canadian troops home after VE Day until they were decommissioned in late 1945. All three were broken up in 1946–47.

Upon commissioning in 1932–33, the D class formed the 1st Destroyer Flotilla assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. The flotilla toured the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting in the UK during 1934, the flotilla was transferred to the China Station, arriving at Hong Kong in January 1935 and renumbered as the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. Most of the flotilla was sent to the Red Sea during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935–36. They returned to the Hong Kong in mid-1936 and remained there until World War II began. &quot;Diamond&quot; was in the midst of a refit that lasted until November, but the rest of the flotilla was immediately transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Daring&quot; was kept in the Red Sea for escort duties until November, but the rest of the flotilla was used on contraband patrol duties upon arrival. They all needed repairs which were made before the end of the year.

&quot;Duncan&quot;, &quot;Diana&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Delight&quot; and &quot;Daring&quot; were transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although &quot;Duchess&quot; was rammed and sunk on 10 December by the battleship that she was escorting. &quot;Duncan&quot; was so badly damaged in a collision with a merchant ship in January 1940 that her repairs required six months to complete. &quot;Daring&quot; was sunk by the on 18 February while escorting a convoy from Norway. &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Delight&quot; were assigned to convoy escort duties in early 1940, before participating in the Norwegian Campaign in April–June. While attempting to sail through the English Channel in daylight, contrary to orders, &quot;Delight&quot; was sunk by German aircraft on 29 July. After a brief refit in July–August, &quot;Diana&quot; was transferred to the RCN to replace HMCS &quot;Fraser&quot; which had been sunk in a collision by a Royal Navy cruiser. Recommissioned on 6 September and renamed HMCS &quot;Margaree&quot;, the ship was assigned to convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic. On 22 October, she was sunk in a collision with the freighter .

The remaining four ships of the flotilla were briefly assigned to Freetown, West Africa in early 1940 to escort convoys passing through the area and to search for German commerce raiders. They were all recalled to the Mediterranean in April–May in anticipation of Italian entry into the war. &quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, and &quot;Dainty&quot; sank two Italian submarines, &quot;Dainty&quot; sinking one more with the destroyer in June, before they participated in the Battle of Calabria early the following month. &quot;Diamond&quot; joined her sisters in late July and all four ships escorted convoys and the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for the rest of the year. &quot;Duncan&quot; joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento together with &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot; in November. &quot;Decoy&quot; had been damaged by aircraft earlier that month and was under repair until February 1941.

While patrolling the North African coast on 24 February with the destroyer , &quot;Dainty&quot; was sunk by German bombers. &quot;Duncan&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot; continued to provide escorts as needed in early 1941, although &quot;Duncan&quot; was transferred to Freetown in March. &quot;Decoy&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot; evacuated Allied troops from Greece and Crete in April–May, although &quot;Diamond&quot; was sunk by German aircraft on 27 April while doing so. After &quot;Defender&quot; participated in the invasion of Vichy French-controlled Syria and Lebanon in June, she joined &quot;Decoy&quot; in escorting convoys to Tobruk and was badly damaged when returning from one of these missions. The ship was attacked by a single German Junkers Ju 88 bomber on 11 July and had to be scuttled by her consort, the Australian destroyer . &quot;Duncan&quot; rejoined Force H that same month and she escorted several major convoys to Malta before returning to the UK in October for a lengthy refit. &quot;Decoy&quot; was damaged in a collision in December and was repaired at Malta until February 1942.

&quot;Decoy&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March and was escorting Force B when the Japanese carriers attacked Ceylon. The Japanese never spotted Force B, and the ship remained with the fleet until ordered home in September to convert to an escort destroyer. After &quot;Duncan&quot;″s refit was completed in January 1942, she rejoined Force H and escorted several missions to fly off Royal Air Force fighters from aircraft carriers to Malta before she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in April to support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Diego Suarez, in early May. She, too, was recalled to the UK to be modified as an escort destroyer.
&quot;Decoy&quot; was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 March 1943 during her conversion and was recommissioned on 12 April with the new name of HMCS &quot;Kootenay&quot; (the ship was gifted to the Canadians on 15 June). After working up, she was assigned to Escort Group C5 for convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic. In April, &quot;Duncan&quot; joined Escort Group B-7. While defending Convoy ON-207 on 23 October, &quot;Duncan&quot;, together with the destroyer and a Consolidated B-24 Liberator of No. 224 Squadron RAF, sank . Later the same month, on 29 October, &quot;Duncan&quot; shared the sinking of with &quot;Vidette&quot; and the corvette while protecting Convoy ON-208. Both ships remained on escort duty until May 1944 when they were transferred to the UK in preparation for Operation Overlord. &quot;Duncan&quot; was assigned to the Western Approaches Command, conducting anti-submarine operations, for the rest of the war. &quot;Kootenay&quot; was tasked to protect Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay and, together with other ships, she sank in the English Channel on 7 July 1944, in the Bay of Biscay on 18 August, and, two days later, west of Brest.

After a lengthy refit in Canada from October 1944 to February 1945, &quot;Kootenay&quot; returned to the UK and was assigned to the Western Approaches Command until the end of the war. She then transported returning troops in Canada until paid off in October. She was sold for scrap in 1946. &quot;Duncan&quot; was paid off in May and sold in July although she was not completely broken up until 1949.

<text>Nekhen (, ), also known as Hierakonpolis (; , meaning City of Hawks or City of Falcons, a reference to Horus; ) was the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at the end of prehistoric Egypt ( 3200–3100 BC) and probably also during the Early Dynastic Period ( 3100–2686 BC).

The oldest known tomb with painted decoration, a mural on its plaster walls, is located in Nekhen and is thought to date to c. 3500–3200 BC. It shares distinctive imagery with artifacts from the Gerzeh culture.

==Horus cult center==
Nekhen was the center of the cult of a falcon deity, Horus of Nekhen, which raised one of the most ancient Egyptian temples in this city. It retained its importance as the center for this divine patron of the kings long after the site had otherwise declined.

The first settlement at Nekhen dates from either the predynastic Amratian culture (c. 4400 BC) or, perhaps, during the late Badarian culture (c. 5000 BC). At its height, from c. 3400 BC, Nekhen had at least 5,000 and possibly, as many as 10,000 inhabitants. Most of Upper Egypt then became unified under rulers from Abydos during the Naqada III period (3200–3000 BCE), at the expense of rival cities, especially Nekhen (Hierakonpolis). The conflicts leading to the supremacy of Abydos may appear on numerous reliefs of the Naqada II period, such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife, or the frieze of Tomb 100 at Nekhen (Hierakonpolis).

The ruins of the city originally were excavated toward the end of the nineteenth century by the English archaeologists James Quibell and Frederick W. Green.
Quibell and Green discovered the &quot;Main Deposit&quot;, a foundation deposit beneath the temple, in 1894. Quibell originally was trained under Flinders Petrie, the father of modern Egyptology, however, he failed to follow Petrie&#x27;s methods. The temple was a difficult site to excavate to begin with, so his excavation was poorly conducted and then, poorly documented. Specifically, the situational context of the items therein is poorly recorded and often, the reports of Quibell and Green are in contradiction.

The most famous artifact commonly associated with the main deposit, the Narmer Palette, now is thought probably not to have been in the main deposit at all. Quibell&#x27;s report made in 1900 put the palette in the deposit, but Green&#x27;s report in 1902 put it about one to two yards away. Green&#x27;s version is substantiated by earlier field notes (Quibell kept none), so it is now the accepted record of events.
The main deposit dates to the early Old Kingdom, but the artistic style of the objects in the deposit indicate that they were from Naqada III and were moved into the deposit at a later date. The other important item in the deposit clearly dates to the late prehistoric. This object, the Scorpion Macehead, depicts a king known only by the ideogram for scorpion, now called Scorpion II, participating in what seems to be a ritual irrigation ceremony. Although the Narmer Palette is more famous because it shows the first king to wear both the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Scorpion Macehead indicates some early military hostility with the north by showing dead lapwings, the symbol of Lower Egypt, hung from standards.

John Garstang excavated at Nekhen in 1905–06. He initially hoped to excavate the town site, but encountered difficulties working there, and soon turned his attention to the area he misidentified as a &#x27;fort&#x27; instead. That site dates to the second dynasty King Khasekhemwy. Beneath that area, Garstang excavated a Predynastic cemetery consisting of 188 graves, which served the bulk of the city population during the late Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods, revealing the burial practices of the non-elite Egyptians living at Nekhen.

More recently, the concession was excavated further by a multinational team of archaeologists, Egyptologists, geologists, and members of other sciences, which was coordinated by Michael Hoffman until his death in 1990, then by Barbara Adams of University College London and Dr. Renee Friedman representing the University of California, Berkeley and the British Museum, until Barbara Adams&#x27;s death in 2001, and by Renée Friedman thereafter.

==Possible ritual structures==
The structure at Nekhen known by the misnomer &quot;fort&quot; is a massive mud-brick enclosure built by King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty. It appears to be similar in structure and ritual purpose as the similarly misidentified &#x27;forts&#x27; constructed at Abydos, all without apparent military function. The true function of these structures is unknown, but they seem to be related to the rituals of kingship and the culture. Religion was interwoven inexorably with kingship in Ancient Egypt.

The ritual structure at Nekhen was built on a prehistoric cemetery. The excavations there, as well as the work of later brick robbers, have seriously undermined the walls and led to the near collapse of the structure. For two years, during 2005 and 2006, the team led by Friedman attempted to stabilize the existing structure and support the endangered areas of the structure with new mudbricks.

Excavations at Hierakonpolis (Upper Egypt) in 1998 found archaeological evidence of ritual masks similar to those used in locations further south of Egypt and significant amounts of obsidian which were linked to Ethiopian quarry sites.

==Oldest known Egyptian painted tomb==

Other discoveries at Nekhen include Tomb 100, the oldest known tomb with a mural painted on its plaster walls. The sepulchre is thought to date to the Gerzeh culture (c. 3500–3200 BC).

It is presumed that the mural shows religious scenes and images. It includes figures featured in Egyptian culture for three thousand years—a funerary procession of barques, presumably a goddess standing between two upright lionesses, a wheel of various horned quadrupeds, several examples of a staff that became associated with the deity of the earliest cattle culture and one being held up by a heavy-breasted goddess. Animals depicted include onagers or zebras, ibexes, ostriches, lionesses, impalas, gazelles, and cattle.

Several interpretations of the themes and designs visible in the Nekhen fresco have been associated with a distinctly foreign artifact found in Egypt, the Gebel el-Arak Knife (c. 3500–3200 BCE), with a Mesopotamian scene described as the Master of animals, showing a presumed figure between two lions, presumed fighting scenes, or the boats.

==Oldest known zoo==
The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Nekhen in 2009 of a menagerie that dates to c. 3500 BC. The animals, numbering in totality fourteen during May 2015, include a leopard, two crocodiles, hippopotami, hartebeest, two elephants, baboons, and African wildcats. Animals discovered at the cemetery site were found to have had broken bones.

== Continuous activity ==
There are later tombs at Nekhen, dating to the Middle Kingdom, Second Intermediate Period, and New Kingdom. In the painted tomb of Horemkhauef a biographical inscription reporting a journey to the capital by him was found. He lived during the Second Intermediate Period. 
Because it had a strong association with Egyptian religious ideas about kingship, the temple of Horus at Nekhen was used as late as the Ptolemaic Kingdom, persisting as a religious center throughout the thousands of years of Ancient Egyptian culture.

==Artifacts==
===Cylinder seals===
Cylinders seals at Nekhen include some of the first known scenes of an ancient Egyptian king smiting captive enemies with a mace. Cylinder seals are generally thought to have been derived from Mesopotamian examples, in an instance of Egypt-Mesopotamia relations.
===Cosmetic palettes===
Several of the finest pre-Dynastic decorated palettes were discovered in Nekhen. They display Mesopotamia-inspired animals such as the serpopards, and also incorporate some of the first hieroglyphs.
===Maceheads===

<doc id="704276" wikidata="Q493956" url="?curid=704276" title="Andrea M. Ghez">
<text>Andrea Mia Ghez (born June 16, 1965) is an American astrophysicist, Nobel laureate, and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Lauren B. Leichtman &amp; Arthur E. Levine chair in Astrophysics, at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her research focuses on the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

In 2020, she became the fourth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing one half of the prize with Reinhard Genzel (the other half being awarded to Roger Penrose). The Nobel Prize was awarded to Ghez and Genzel for their discovery of a supermassive compact object, now generally recognized to be a black hole, in the Milky Way&#x27;s Galactic Center.

==Early life==
Ghez was born in New York City. She is the daughter of Susanne (née Gayton) and Gilbert Ghez. Her father, of Jewish heritage, was born in Rome, Italy, to a family originally from Tunisia and Frankfurt, Germany. Her mother was from an Irish Catholic family from North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

In 1969, her father completed his Ph.D. at Columbia University and accepted a position at the University of Chicago, where as the child of a faculty member Ghez was able to attend the Laboratory School. The Apollo program Moon landings inspired Ghez to aspire to be the first female astronaut, and her mother encouraged that goal by purchasing a telescope. Her most influential female role model was her high school chemistry teacher.

She began college by majoring in mathematics, then changed to physics. She received a BS in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987. While there, she was a member of the fraternity of St. Anthony Hall. She received a PhD under the direction of Gerry Neugebauer at the California Institute of Technology in 1992.

==Career==
Ghez&#x27;s research employs high spatial resolution imaging techniques, such as the adaptive optics system at the Keck telescopes, to study star-forming regions and the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way known as Sagittarius A*. She uses the kinematics of stars near the center of the Milky Way as a probe to investigate this region. The high resolution of the Keck telescopes gave a significant improvement over the first major study of galactic center kinematics by Reinhard Genzel&#x27;s group.

In 2004, Ghez was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2012, she was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 2019, she was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS).

Ghez has appeared in many television documentaries produced by networks such as the BBC, Discovery Channel, and The History Channel. In 2006 she was in an episode of the PBS series &quot;Nova&quot;. She was identified as a Science Hero by The My Hero Project. In 2000, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine listed Ghez as one of 20 promising young American scientists in their respective fields.

===Black hole at the Galactic Center (Sgr A*)===

By imaging the Galactic Center at infrared wavelengths, Ghez and her colleagues have been able to peer through heavy dust that blocks visible light, to reveal images of the center of the Milky Way. Thanks to the 10-meter aperture of the W.M. Keck Telescope and the use of adaptive optics to correct for the turbulence of the atmosphere, these images of the Galactic Center are at very high spatial resolution and have made it possible to follow the orbits of stars around the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The partial orbits of many stars orbiting the black hole at the Galactic Center have been observed. One of the stars, S2, has made a complete elliptical orbit since detailed observations began in 1995. Several decades more will be required to completely document the orbits of some of these stars. These measurements may provide a test of the theory of general relativity. In October 2012, a second star, S0-102, was identified by her team at UCLA, orbiting the Galactic Center. Using Kepler&#x27;s third law, Ghez&#x27;s team used the orbital motion to show that the mass of Sgr A* is 4.1±0.6 million solar masses. Because the Galactic Center where Sgr A* is located, is one hundred times closer than M31 where the next nearest supermassive black hole (M31*) is, it is one of the best demonstrated cases for a supermassive black hole.

In 2020, Ghez shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Roger Penrose and Reinhard Genzel, for their discoveries relating to black holes. Ghez and Genzel were awarded one half of the prize for their discovery that a supermassive black hole most likely governs the orbits of stars at the center of the Milky Way. Ghez was the fourth woman to win the physics Nobel since its inception, being preceded by Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963), and Donna Strickland (2018).

<doc id="704287" wikidata="Q1299477" url="?curid=704287" title="Aerostat">
<text>An aerostat (, via French) or lighter-than-air aircraft is an aircraft that relies on buoyancy to maintain flight. Aerostats include the unpowered balloons (free-flying or tethered) and the powered airships.

The relative density of an aerostat as a whole is lower than that of the surrounding atmospheric air (hence the name &quot;lighter-than-air&quot;). Its main component is one or more gas capsules made of lightweight skins, containing a lifting gas (hot air, or any gas with lower density than air, typically hydrogen or helium) that displaces a large volume of air to generate enough buoyancy to overcome its own weight. Payload (passengers and cargo) can then be carried on attached components such as a basket, a gondola, a cabin or various hardpoints. With airships, which need to be able to fly against wind, the lifting gas capsules are often protected by a more rigid outer envelope or an airframe, with other gasbags such as ballonets to help modulate buoyancy.

Aerostats are so named because they use aerostatic buoyant force that does not require any forward movement through the surrounding air mass, resulting in the inherent ability to levitate and perform vertical takeoff and landing. This contrasts with the heavier-than-air aerodynes that primarily use aerodynamic lift, which must have consistent airflow over an aerofoil (wing) surface to stay airborne. The term has also been used in a narrower sense, to refer to the statically tethered balloon in contrast to the free-flying airship. This article uses the term in its broader sense.

==Terminology==

In conventional usage, the term aerostat refers to any aircraft that remains aloft primarily using aerostatic buoyancy.

Historically, all aerostats were called balloons. Powered types capable of horizontal flight were referred to as dirigible balloons or simply dirigibles (from the French &quot;dirigeable&quot;, meaning &quot;steerable&quot;). These powered aerostats later came to be called airships, with the term &quot;balloon&quot; reserved for unpowered types, whether tethered (which means attached to the ground) or free-floating.

More recently, the US Government Accountability Office has used the term &quot;aerostat&quot; in a different sense, to distinguish the statically tethered balloon from the free-flying airship.

==Types==
===Balloons===
A balloon is an unpowered aerostat which has no means of propulsion and must be either tethered on a long cable or allowed to drift freely with the wind.

Although a free balloon travels at the speed of the wind, it is travelling with the wind so to a passenger the air feels calm and windless. To change its altitude above ground it must either adjust the amount of lift or discard ballast weight. Notable uses of free-flying balloons include meteorological balloons and sport balloons.

A tethered balloon is held down by one or more mooring lines or tethers. It has sufficient lift to hold the line taut and its altitude is controlled by winching the line in or out. A tethered balloon does feel the wind. A round balloon is unstable and bobs about in strong winds, so the kite balloon was developed with an aerodynamic shape similar to a non-rigid airship. Both kite balloons and non-rigid airships are sometimes called &quot;blimps&quot;. Notable uses of tethered balloons include observation balloons and barrage balloons and notable uses of untethered balloons include espionage balloons and fire balloons.

===Airships===

An airship is a powered, free-flying aerostat that can be steered. Airships divide into rigid, semi-rigid and non-rigid types, with these last often known as blimps.

A rigid airship has an outer framework or skin surrounding the lifting gas bags inside it, The outer envelope keeps its shape even if the gasbags are deflated. The great zeppelin airships of the twentieth century were rigid types.

A non-rigid airship or blimp deflates like a balloon as it loses gas. The Goodyear blimps are still a common sight in the USA.

A semi-rigid airship has a deflatable gas bag like a non-rigid but with a supporting structure to help it hold its shape while aloft. The first practical airship, the Santos-Dumont No. 6 was a semi-rigid.

Some airships obtain additional lift aerodynamically as they travel through the air, using the shape of their envelope or through the addition of fins or even small wings. Types designed to exploit this lifting effect in normal cruise are called hybrid airships.

===Hybrid aerostats===
A hybrid type uses both static buoyancy and dynamic airflow to provide lift. The dynamic movement may be created either using propulsive power as a hybrid airship or by tethering in the wind like a kite, as a Helikite or kytoon.

The Allsopp Helikite is a combination of a helium balloon and a kite to form a single, aerodynamically sound tethered aircraft, that exploits both wind and helium for its lift. Helikites are semi-rigid. Helikites are considered the most stable, energy and cost-efficient aerostats available. This gives Helikites various advantages over traditional aerostats. Traditional aerostats need to utilize relatively low-lift helium gas to combat high winds, which means they need to have a lot of gas to cope and so are very large, unwieldy and expensive. Helikites exploit wind lift so they only need to be a fraction of the size of traditional aerostats in order to operate in high winds. Helikites fly many times higher altitude than traditional aerostats of the same size. Being smaller, with fewer construction seams, means Helikites have minimal problems with gas leakage compared to traditional aerostats, so Helikites use far less helium.

Helikites do not need ballonets and so are simpler in construction than traditional aerostats and Helikites do not need constant electrical power to keep them airborne. Helikites are also extremely stable and so are good aerial platforms for cameras or scientific instruments. Tiny Helikites will fly in all weathers, so these sizes are popular as they are very reliable but still easy to handle and do not require large expensive winches. Helikites can be small enough to fit fully inflated in a car but they can also be made large if heavy payloads are required to be flown to high altitudes. Helikites are one of the most popular aerostat designs and are widely used by the scientific community, military, photographers, geographers, police, first responders. Helikites are used by telecoms companies to lift 4G and 5G base stations for areas without cellphone coverage.

Helikites range in size from 1 metre (gas volume 0.13 m3) with a pure helium lift of 30g, up to 14 metres (gas volume 250m3) able to lift 117 kg. Small Helikites can fly up to altitudes of 1,000 ft, and medium-sized Helikites up to altitudes of 3,000 ft, while large Helikites can achieve 7,000 ft.

Piasecki Helicopter developed the Piasecki PA-97 Helistat using the rotor systems from four obsolete helicopters and a surplus Navy blimp, in order to provide a capability to lift heavier loads than a single helicopter could provide. The aircraft suffered a fatal accident during a test flight. In 2008, Boeing and SkyHook International resurrected the concept and announced a proposed design of the SkyHook JHL-40.

==Lifting gases==
In order to provide buoyancy, any lifting gas must be less dense than the surrounding air. A hot air balloon is open at the bottom to allow hot air to enter, while the gas balloon is closed to stop the (cold) lifting gas from escaping. Common lifting gases have included hydrogen, coal gas and helium.

===Hot air===
When heated, air expands. This lowers its density and creates lift. Small hot air balloons or lanterns have been flown in China since ancient times. The first modern man-lifting aerostat, made by the Montgolfier brothers, was a hot air balloon. Most early balloons however were gas balloons. Interest in the sport of hot air ballooning reawoke in the second half of the twentieth century and even some hot-air airships have been flown.

===Hydrogen===
Hydrogen is the lightest of all gases and a manned hydrogen balloon was flown soon after the Montgolfier brothers. There is no need to burn fuel, so a gas balloon can stay aloft far longer than a hot-air balloon. Hydrogen soon became the most common lifting gas for both balloons and, later, airships. But hydrogen itself is flammable and, following several major disasters in the 1930s, including the Hindenburg Disaster, it fell out of use.

===Coal gas===
Coal gas comprises a mix of methane and other gases, and typically has about half the lifting power of hydrogen. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries municipal gas works became common and provided a cheap source of lifting gas. Some works were able to produce a special mix for ballooning events, incorporating a higher proportion of hydrogen and less carbon monoxide, to improve its lifting power.

===Helium===
Helium is the only lifting gas which is both non-flammable and non-toxic, and it has almost as much (about 92%) lifting power as hydrogen. It was not discovered in quantity until early in the twentieth century, and for many years only the United States had enough to use in airships. Almost all gas balloons and airships now use helium.

===Low-pressure gases===

Although not currently practical, it may be possible to construct a rigid, lighter-than-air structure which, rather than being inflated with air, is at a vacuum relative to the surrounding air. This would allow the object to float above the ground without any heat or special lifting gas, but the structural challenges of building a rigid vacuum chamber lighter than air are quite significant. Even so, it may be possible to improve the performance of more conventional aerostats by trading gas weight for structural weight, combining the lifting properties of the gas with vacuum and possibly heat for enhanced lift.

==Buoyancy control==
The buoyancy control of an aerostat relies on the principles of buoyant force and the manipulation of the gas inside its envelope. Aerostats use lighter-than-air gases, such as helium or hydrogen, which provide lift because they are less dense than the surrounding air. The amount of buoyant force generated depends on the volume of the gas, its density, and the density of the outside atmosphere. By controlling these variables, an aerostat can be made to rise, descend, or maintain a stable altitude. The basic mechanism involves adjusting the volume and pressure of the gas within the aerostat’s envelope, often through a system of valves and compartments.

To ascend, the aerostat releases ballast, which typically consists of sandbags or other weights, reducing its overall weight and making it lighter than the air it displaces. Alternatively, it may adjust the temperature of the gas (if using hot air) or expand the volume of gas within its envelope. As the gas volume increases, the aerostat becomes less dense and rises. This is controlled either through heating (in the case of hot air balloons) or by adjusting the valves that manage the flow of gas between different compartments or the outside atmosphere. Helium-based aerostats, such as blimps, rely on maintaining the integrity and volume of the helium within their envelope to achieve a stable lift.

When descending, the aerostat must reduce its buoyancy, which can be done by venting some of the gas or by taking on additional ballast. Venting gas allows the envelope to lose volume, making the aerostat denser than the surrounding air and causing it to descend. However, venting must be done cautiously, especially with helium, as it is a limited resource and cannot be replenished easily during flight. Alternatively, an aerostat might use a reversible system where it can compress the gas into smaller compartments within the envelope, reducing lift without permanently losing the gas. By managing these compartments or adjusting the flow of gas, the aerostat’s buoyancy can be precisely controlled.

To maintain altitude, an aerostat achieves a balance where the lift force generated by the gas equals the weight of the aerostat. This equilibrium is achieved through small adjustments in ballast or the gas volume. Sophisticated systems might use automatic valves and sensors to monitor atmospheric pressure, gas volume, and temperature, ensuring that the aerostat remains stable without manual intervention. This constant regulation allows aerostats to hover at a fixed altitude for extended periods, making them useful for applications such as surveillance, communication relays, or scientific observations, where maintaining a consistent position in the atmosphere is crucial.

<text>DownBeat (styled in all caps) is an American music magazine devoted to &quot;jazz, blues and beyond&quot;, the last word indicating its expansion beyond the jazz realm that it covered exclusively in previous years. The publication was established in 1934 in Chicago, Illinois. It is named after the &quot;downbeat&quot; in music, also called &quot;beat one&quot;, or the first beat of a musical measure.

&quot;DownBeat&quot; publishes results of annual surveys of both its readers and critics in a variety of categories. The &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame includes winners from both the readers&#x27; and critics&#x27; poll. The results of the readers&#x27; poll are published in the December issue, those of the critics&#x27; poll in the August issue. Since 2008, the Hall of Fame also includes winners from the Veterans Committee.

Popular features of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine include its &quot;Reviews&quot; section where jazz critics, using a &#x27;1-Star to 5-Star&#x27; maximum rating system, rate the latest musical recordings, vintage recordings, and books; articles on individual musicians and music forms; and its famous &quot;Blindfold Test&quot; column, in which a musician listens to records by other artists, tries to guess who they are, and rates them using the 5-star maximum rating system.

==History==
&quot;DownBeat&quot; was established in 1934 in Chicago, Illinois. In September 1939, the magazine announced that its circulation had increased from &quot;a few hundred five years ago to more than 80,000 copies a month&quot;, and that it would change from monthly to fortnightly from the following month. In Summer 1960 &quot;DownBeat&quot; launched the Japanese edition. In 1972 the publisher of the magazine was Maher Publishers. Starting in July 1979, &quot;DownBeat&quot; went to a monthly schedule for the first time since 1939.

&quot;DownBeat&quot; was named Jazz Publication of the Year in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021 by the Jazz Journalists Association.

== DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame ==
The &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame&#x27;s current membership, by year, is listed in the following table. The Readers&#x27; Poll began in 1952, the Critics&#x27; Poll in 1961, and the Veterans Committee Poll in 2008.

<text>William Henry Eccles FRS (23 August 1875 – 29 April 1966) was a British physicist and a pioneer in the development of radio communication.

He was born in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire, England. Following graduation from the Royal College of Science, London, in 1898, he became an assistant to Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian radio entrepreneur. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the Royal College of Science. Eccles was an advocate of Oliver Heaviside&#x27;s theory that a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere could reflect radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, thus enabling their transmission over long distances. Originally known as the Kennelly–Heaviside layer, this region of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere became known as the ionosphere. In 1912 Eccles suggested that solar radiation was responsible for the observed differences in radio wave propagation during the day and night. He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work. Eccles invented the term diode to describe an evacuated glass tube containing two electrodes; an anode and a cathode.

Following World War I Eccles&#x27; main interest was in electronic circuit development. In 1918 he worked in collaboration with F. W. Jordan to patent the flip-flop circuit, which became the basis of electronic memory in computers. In 1919, Eccles became vice-chairman of the Imperial Wireless Committee. He helped in the design of the first long wave radio station, and became involved in the early work of the British Broadcasting Company (later the BBC) following its establishment in 1922.

William Eccles was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). He was President of the Physical Society from 1928 to 1930, President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) in 1926, and President of the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB) in 1923–24.

He died in Oxford.

<text>The Latin Casino was a Philadelphia-area nightclub that first opened in 1944 as the &quot;Latin&quot; located at 1309 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Many top entertainers performed at the Latin, including Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Durante, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Richard Pryor, Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Lena Horne, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Joey Bishop, and others.

The Latin was a very popular Center City Philadelphia nightclub for a decade. 

In 1960, owners Stanley and Bea Carroll, David Dushoff, and Daniel &quot;Dallas&quot; Gerson relocated the nightclub to 2235 Route 70 in nearby Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and built a plush 1,500-seat, Vegas-style dinner theater renamed from the &quot;Latin&quot; to the &quot;Latin Casino&quot;, although casino gambling was not included. It was considered one of the fanciest, hippest dinner nightclub experiences of that time featuring dinner, drinks and a showcase of top entertainment, and was called &quot;The Showplace of the Stars&quot;.

==History==
In 1943 the first supper club including entertainment was opened by Jack Price and Arthur Friedman in Center City Philadelphia. Friedman was key to the night clubs&#x27; start-up because he was a US Army veteran, that status enabled him to obtain the liquor license needed to open and operate the night club. Arthur Friedman was Jack Price&#x27;s nephew. He was the son of Frieda Friedman who was Jack Price&#x27;s sister. The night club was then purchased by Stanley and Bea Carroll, David Dushoff and Dallas Gerson in 1951 and was originally located near Juniper and Walnut Streets in Center City, Philadelphia. 

Frustrated by Pennsylvania&#x27;s restrictive liquor laws, conflicts with city officials, the desire for more parking space, and outgrowing its small size, the two owners decided to move across the Delaware River five miles to Delaware Township, New Jersey (soon to be renamed Cherry Hill) in 1960. The new Latin was four times as large and located diagonally across the highway from the Seashore Line tracks and Garden State Park Race Track. Some of the first acts who played The Latin were Patti Page, comedian Sammy Shore, and Johnny Mathis.

==Theatre==
&quot;The Latin&quot; theatre was a famous showroom for showcasing entertainers, like the area&#x27;s neighbors of Cherry Hill Estates, the popular singer/performers Bobby Darin, Al Martino, and Frankie Avalon, whose family had ownership interests in a popular pizzeria &quot;King of Pizza&quot; diagonally across Route 70. Stars that appeared on stage and frequented the area were Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, Richard Pryor, who recorded his 1975 album &quot;...Is It Something I Said?&quot; there, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Pat Cooper, The Temptations, The Supremes, Liza Minnelli, Tom Jones, Donna Summer, B.B. King, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Connie Francis, Joan Rivers, Don Rickles, Gloria Gaynor, Della Reese, Eddie Fisher, Trini Lopez, Allan Sherman, Doris Ruby, Fran Warren, Danny Thomas, and Engelbert Humperdinck. The celebrities and orchestra players performing at nightclub often drank at the neighboring Rickshaw Inn lobby bar.

There were several celebrity incidents that drew media attention. On September 29, 1975, Jackie Wilson suffered a massive heart attack while playing a Dick Clark show, falling head-first to the stage. He was singing his hit &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; and was stricken just after the line &quot;My heart is crying, crying.&quot; Wilson became comatose and was taken to Cherry Hill Hospital; he lived in a nursing home until his death at age 49. 

Brenda Lee broke her neck onstage during a June 12, 1962, performance, and eventually recovered in time to graduate high school. Tom Jones was also once jumped outside the back door following one of his performances by two fanatical Italian women going by the name Canni. Mr. Jones was not hurt but the ladies were banned from &#x27;The Latin&#x27; and from any Tom Jones performance. Philadelphia-native Bob Saget in 2017 talked about trying to sneak-in to the Latin Casino to see Don Rickles perform. He was arrested.

In 1978, the Latin Casino finally closed following a period of strong popular success. It was an indication of an end of era and a symbol of the evolution of pop culture. Five months later, at the height of the disco craze, it reopened as an exotic disco club, Emerald City. Success was short-lived, and it was converted to a venue for progressive rock bands and finally closed in December 1982, and was later demolished for commercial use.

Also in 1978, with nightclubs in a general state of decline and competition from casinos in Atlantic City imminent, the Latin Casino was converted to a disco called Emerald City that boasted a neon light show over the dance floor that cost in excess of one million dollars. After a couple years Emerald City shifted from disco to rock club, hosting major and up-and-coming acts of the time such as The Rolling Stones, James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames (who recorded their 1967 album, &quot;Live at The Garden&quot;, there), Aerosmith, The Ramones, Ultravox, Talking Heads, Elvis Costello, Alice Cooper, Madonna, The B-52&#x27;s, The Go-Go&#x27;s, Squeeze, Joan Jett, Dire Straits, The Romantics, UB40, Joe Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, The Psychedelic Furs, George Thorogood &amp; the Destroyers, Blue Öyster Cult, and Prince on his debut tour. The Cure played their first ever U.S. show at this venue on April 10, 1980. It was torn down in the mid-1980s after a fire. The headquarters of Subaru of America was then built on the site, opening in 1986. Upon Subaru moving their headquarters to Camden in 2018, their former headquarters were demolished throughout May 2019.

In November 2019, the club was recreated for the setting of a scene in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film “The Irishman.”

==Restaurant==
The menu reflected the Pop culture choices of the 1960s. The artwork for the menu cover was an ink drawing of the exterior façade on a background of drink glasses, music notes, and star like asterisks. In the inside cover the management stated &quot;The Latin Casino offers the ultimate in facilities for Banquets, Conventions, Trade Shows, Fund Raising Events of every type. Group size may be from 20 to 2000.&quot;

The two page menu had a variety of American styled selections intended to attract the crowd seeking entertainment excitement, as well as the large groups for banquets or a grand place for various celebrations. On page one of food and listed on the left hand page were six headings that included nine appetizers, two soups/salad, 12 entrees (including lobster and steaks), vegetables, six desserts, and three Beverages (no soda), with a final comment by the management: &quot;May we suggest an after dinner drink?&quot; On the right hand page of the menu was a section titled, &quot;From Our Chinese Kitchen,&quot; which offered 13 oriental entrees and several side dishes. A final item ending this page outlined in a long rectangle was a special menu selection of a “Complete Polynesian Dinner”.

<doc id="704317" wikidata="Q21716670" url="?curid=704317" title="Tilehurst">
<text>Tilehurst is a village on the outskirts of the town of Reading in the county of Berkshire, England. It lies to the west of the centre of Reading; it extends from the River Thames in the north to the A4 road in the south. 

The village is partly within the boundaries of the borough of Reading and partly in the district of West Berkshire. The part within West Berkshire forms part of the civil parish of Tilehurst, which also includes the northern part of Calcot and a small rural area west of the village. The part within the borough of Reading includes the Reading electoral ward of Tilehurst, together with parts of Kentwood and Norcot wards.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Tilehurst&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;tigel&quot; meaning &quot;tile&quot; and &quot;hurst&quot; meaning &quot;wooded hill&quot;. Alternative spellings have included &quot;Tygelhurst&quot; (13th century), &quot;Tyghelhurst&quot; (14th century), and &quot;Tylehurst&quot; (16th century). The present spelling became commonplace in the 18th century.

== History ==
Tilehurst was first recorded in 1291, when it was listed as a hamlet of Reading in Pope Nicholas III&#x27;s taxation. At this time, the settlement was under the ownership of Reading Abbey, where it stayed until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Tilehurst became an extensive parish, which included the tything of Theale as well as the manors of Tilehurst, Kentwood, Pincents and Beansheaf. In 1545, Henry VIII granted the manor of Tilehurst (now Calcot) to Francis Englefield, who held it until his attainder (and forfeiture of the manor) in 1586. The following year, Elizabeth I gave the manor to Henry Forster of Aldermaston and George Fitton. Forster and Fitton possessed the manor until the turn of the century, when Elizabeth sold it to Henry Best and Francis Jackson.

Over the space of five years, the manor passed from Best and Jackson to the son of Sir Thomas Crompton, then on to Dutch merchant Peter Vanlore. Vanlore built a manor house on the estate—Calcot Park. Throughout the 17th century the manor passed through the Vanlore family to the Dickenson family, before being purchased in 1687 by the Wilder family of Nunhide (builders of Wilder&#x27;s Folly) for £1,075. Page and Ditchfield write that in the early 18th century the manor was also owned by the family of John Kendrick, albeit for a short period.

The manor subsequently passed to Benjamin Child, who married Mary Kendrick, heir of the Kendrick family. After Kendrick&#x27;s death, Childs sold the manor to descendants of John Blagrave in 1759. The Blagrave family built the present-day Calcot House, which—according to one story—was made necessary by Child&#x27;s eviction. After Child sold the estate to the Blagraves, he was reluctant to leave the house. The Blagraves were forced to remove the building&#x27;s roof to &quot;flush&quot; him out of the building, thereby requiring a new building to replace the uninhabitable original house. The manor was retained by the Blagrave family until the 1920s, after which it served as the clubhouse for the estate&#x27;s golf course and was later converted into apartments.

The manor of Kentwood was owned by Peter Vanlore, before passing through the Kentwood family (taking their name from the manor itself), the Swafield family, the Yate family, the Fettiplace family and the Dunch family. In 1719, the manor was divided between heirs. The manor of Pincents was named after the local Pincent family. Originally from Sulhamstead, the family owned the manor until the end of the 15th century. After this, it was owned by the Sambourne family before they sold it to the Windsor family. In 1598, the manor was sold to the Blagrave family; its succession through the family is identical to that of Calcot Park. In the 1920s, the manor was sold off and later became a wedding and conference venue. The manor of Beansheaf took its name from a 13th-century Tilehurst family. In 1316, John Beansheaf granted some of the manor&#x27;s land to John Stonor. While it is not recorded how much was granted, it is likely that Stonor inherited the entire estate as the Beansheaf name did not appear in subsequent records.

In 1390, Ralf Stonor gave the manor to William Sutton of Campden and John Frank. Frank later returned his share of the manor to Ralf Stonor, after which the manor was retained by the Stonor family until the end of the 15th century. The manor left the Stonor family when John Stonor died with no heirs. It passed through his sister, Anne, to her husband—Adrian Fortescue. Some of the manor was later reinherited by the Stonors, though the majority was retained by the Fortescues until passing through marriage to the Wentworth family. In 1562 the manor was bought by John Bolney and Ambrose Dormer, after which it was passed into the family of Tanfield Vachell. The manor was inherited by the Blagrave family some time after 1600.

Throughout the 19th century, a number of changes came to Tilehurst. A national school was founded in 1819 to provide education to children not in private schooling. The Great Western Main Line was built through Berkshire in 1841; railway station opened in 1882.

In the 1920s and 30s, many new houses were built in Tilehurst, particularly semi-detached residences. This gave the need for improved utilities; electricity arrived in the 1920s (replacing the gas that fuelled the area from 1906) and Tilehurst Water Tower was built in 1932. After World War II, Tilehurst—like many other settlements—was in need of new housing; from 1950, many houses and estates were built in the area. In the mid-1960s, a prominent Victorian character property, Westwood House with some five acres of open grounds was demolished as part of the ever pressing need for new housing. This site was positioned between Westwood Road and Pierce&#x27;s Hill and had served well as a venue for occasional local social events.

== Governance ==
Tilehurst is divided between the civil parish of Tilehurst in the district of West Berkshire and the electoral wards of Tilehurst and Kentwood (where Tilehurst railway station is located) in the borough of Reading. There are now four ecclesiastical parishes with Tilehurst in their names: Tilehurst St Catherine and Calcot St Birinus, Tilehurst St George, Tilehurst St Mary Magdalen and Tilehurst St Michael (the latter church being the original parish church).

===Administrative history===
Tilehurst was an ancient parish. It historically included Theale to the south-west and also extended eastwards towards Reading as far as the Reading Union Workhouse (which later became Battle Hospital) on Oxford Road, and included Prospect Park. Theale became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1832, and a separate civil parish in 1894.

The eastern end of the parish of Tilehurst around the workhouse and Prospect Park was incorporated into the borough of Reading in September 1887. The civil parish boundary was adjusted to match the new borough boundary eighteen months later in March 1889, with the part of Tilehurst in the borough of Reading being transferred to the civil parish of Reading St Mary. A much larger part of Tilehurst was transferred to the borough of Reading in 1911, including the main village around Tilehurst Triangle (then also known as Tilehurst Common) and Tilehurst&#x27;s parish church of St Michael at Churchend. The civil parish of Tilehurst was reduced as part of the 1911 changes to just cover the then largely rural west of the old parish that was not incorporated into the borough of Reading.

Reading Borough Council proposed to the government that the increasingly urbanised Tilehurst civil parish (as well as Purley on Thames and the eastern part of Theale) should be transferred into the borough of Reading as part of the major local government reforms of 1974. The government decided instead to leave Reading&#x27;s boundaries unchanged from when they had last been reviewed in 1911, placing the Tilehurst civil parish in Newbury district, which became West Berkshire in 1998.

== Geography ==

Tilehurst is situated on a hill (approximately AMSL), to the west of Reading. The land is steep to the west and south of the village; the gradient is smoother north (towards the River Thames) and east (descending towards Reading). 

Much of Tilehurst was enclosed common land during the 18th and 19th centuries; as this land was developed with housing the commons were lost. Arthur Newbery Park is a surviving area of commonland. Similarly, Prospect Park was enclosed and established before major development of the area was undertaken. Tilehurst is bordered to the west by wood and farmland, to the north by other settlements (such as Purley on Thames and the river itself), to the east by Reading and to the south by the Reading to Taunton line, the M4 motorway and the River Kennet.

Tilehurst is centred around Tilehurst Triangle (known locally as &quot;the village&quot;), a pedestrianised area providing shopping, leisure and educational facilities. Other areas of Tilehurst include Kentwood near the railway station in the north, Norcot in the east, Churchend around St Michael&#x27;s parish church in the south, and Little Heath in the west. Tilehurst has a Site of Special Scientific Interest just to the west of the village, called Sulham and Tidmarsh Woods and Meadows. Tilehurst has four local nature reserves called Blundells Copse, Lousehill Copse, McIlroy Park &amp; Round Copse.

== Demography ==
For Tilehurst Ward in Reading, the 2011 census recorded 9,185 residents in the ward and an area of . In the 2001 census there were 14,683 residents in the parish of Tilehurst Without.

== Economy ==
Until the late 19th century, the majority of working men in Tilehurst were employed in farming or similar agricultural work. The main industry associated with Tilehurst, however, was the manufacture of tiles. This industry was present in the district until recent times. The 1881 UK census listed a number of men as being employed as brickmen in kilns in the area. Written evidence of brickwork can be traced to the 1600s, but with the peak of production at around 1885. Kilns were established at Grovelands and Kentwood—both to the east of the settlement—with clay pits being dug on Norcot Hill in an area now known as The Potteries.

An overhead cable was used to transport the clay-filled buckets between the pits and the kiln across Norcot Road; this was shown on a 1942 map of the area as an &quot;aerial cable&quot; running from the clay pit in Kentwood to Grovelands works approximately away. The cable was also included on the 1940s Ordnance Survey &quot;New Popular Edition&quot; maps, labelled as an &quot;aerial ropeway&quot;. An 1883 Ordnance Survey map of Berkshire shows a number of kilns in the Grovelands area (on the present-day Colliers Way estate) and one in Norcot near the present-day Lawrence Road. The latter was more specifically named in the 1899 Pre-WWII 1:2,500 scale Berkshire map as &quot;Norcot Kiln, Brick and Tile Works&quot;. By the 1920s, Tilehurst Potteries had been formally established at Kew Kiln on Kentwood Hill. By the 1960s, clay business had waned and the pits were closed in 1967.

== Architecture ==

The architecture of Tilehurst ranges from 19th century thatched cottages to late 20th-century housing estates. Victorian and Edwardian terraces (built using bricks from the Tilehurst kilns) are common in the area; streets such as Blundells Road and Norcot Road display this type of architecture. 

As the area expanded, a huge number of semi-detached dwellings were built in the mid-20th century, in areas such as St Michael&#x27;s Road (1930s) and on the Berkshire Drive estate (1950s). 

Examples of unique architecture in Tilehurst include two water towers: Tilehurst Water Tower is a 1932 concrete building, open octagonal in design with arcading supporting a cylindrical drum; Norcot Water Tower is an 1890s brick building with tiered blind arcading. 

The Mansion House in Prospect Park (19th century) is a regency mansion built in Portland stone. The north and south faces feature Doric and Ionic order porticos respectively.

== Culture ==
Tilehurst has a horticultural society which holds a produce show annually in August. The village has few establishments for performing arts, as most are provided in Reading. An amateur dramatics society, the Triangle Players, is based in the village. A branch of the Allenova School of Dancing is also situated in Tilehurst. Tilehurst Square Dance Club draws dancers from Reading and beyond and has been operating since 1989.

== Transport ==

Tilehurst railway station is located at the northern edge of the suburb. It is served regular Great Western Railway services between , Reading and London Paddington on the Great Western Main Line. Journey times are approximately 54 minutes to London, five minutes to Reading and 20 minutes to Didcot. Connections to the south and south-west via the Reading to Taunton Line and the Reading to Basingstoke Line are made by changing at Reading.

Reading Buses services 15, 15a, 16, 17, 18 and 33 (with the 85, 86 and 87 serving Little Heath School) serve Tilehurst, connecting the village to Reading, Purley and Theale.

Tilehurst is bordered by two major roads: to the north by the A329 (connecting the village to Reading and Pangbourne) and to the south by the A4 (connecting the village to Reading and Theale). Non-arterial roads in Tilehurst saw a great improvement in the 1940s with the introduction of trolleybuses in Reading.

== Education ==
Tilehurst is served by two comprehensive secondary schools: Denefield School and Little Heath School. The catchment areas of King&#x27;s Academy Prospect and Theale Green Community School also cover parts of Tilehurst. 

Tilehurst is served by Brookfields School, a special school catering for students with moderate, severe or profound and multiple learning disabilities. 

Primary education in Tilehurst includes Birch Copse Primary School, Downsway Primary School, Long Lane Primary School, English Martyrs&#x27; Catholic Primary School, Moorlands Primary School, Park Lane Primary School, Ranikhet Primary School, St Michael&#x27;s Primary School, St Paul&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Springfield Primary School, Meadow Park Academy, Westwood Farm Infant School and Westwood Farm Junior School.

== Places of worship ==

Tilehurst has a number of religious buildings covering numerous denominations: 
* The Church of St Michael, situated centrally in the parish, is a brick church with a square tower. Parts of the building date from the 13th century, replacing an earlier church thought to have been built in 1189. Sir Peter Vanlore is buried in the church&#x27;s Lady chapel. 
* The Anglican church of St Catherine of Siena was built in the Little Heath area of Tilehurst from 1962 to 1964. 
* A Methodist church is near the village centre, and a Latter-day Saints church opened in Tilehurst in the 1970s. 
* The Roman Catholic church of St Joseph was built in Park Lane from 1955 to 1956. 
* Tilehurst also has a United Reformed Church (built on the site of an early 19th-century Congregational Chapel), a Bethel United Church, and Anglican churches dedicated to St George and St Mary Magdalen. 

Tilehurst does not have any synagogues, mosques or gurdwaras; the nearest are in West Reading, central Reading, and East Reading respectively.

== Sport ==
Tilehurst has been represented in numerous sports for over a century:

* Tilehurst Cricket Club has existed since at least 1883. The club originally played on Church End Lane. While the exact location of the ground is unknown, it is likely that it was on a recreation ground behind the present-day Moorlands School. Victoria Recreation Ground was established in 1897 and the cricket club began using the new park as their ground at some point after this. The club joined the Reading and District Cricket League in 1900; the Reading Chronicle reported on the club&#x27;s first game—a loss to nearby Grovelands CC—by saying: &quot;Tilehurst were but poorly represented, several of their best players not having signed the required fourteen days and they had to play ten men only&quot;. Tilehurst joined the newly formed Hampshire League in 1973, proving successful in their first two seasons. Between 1991 and 1996, Tilehurst played in the Berkshire League. The following year, Tilehurst CC merged with Theale CC to form Theale and Tilehurst Cricket Club. The reason for the merger is attributed to Theale&#x27;s lack of players but good facilities and Tilehurst&#x27;s surplus of players but lack of facilities. The club now play at Englefield Road, Theale, in the Thames Valley Cricket League. 
* Tilehurst is represented by three football teams: Barton Rovers, Tilehurst Panthers and Westwood Wanderers. Barton Rovers, established in 1982, are based at Turnham&#x27;s Farm, Little Heath. 
* Tilehurst Panthers, established in 2006, are a ladies team based at Denefield School and the Cotswold Sports Centre. 
* Westwood Wanderers were established in 1972 and are a men&#x27;s team based at the Cotswold Sports Centre. The team play their home matches at Denefield School. 
* Reading Racers were based at Reading Greyhound Stadium from 1968 until the stadium&#x27;s demolition in 1975. The team then moved to Smallmead Stadium, south of Reading.

<text>The Pend Oreille River ( ) is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northern Idaho and northeastern Washington in the United States, as well as southeastern British Columbia in Canada. In its passage through British Columbia its name is spelled Pend-d&#x27;Oreille River. It drains a scenic area of the Rocky Mountains along the U.S.-Canada border on the east side of the Columbia. The river is sometimes defined as the lower part of the Clark Fork, which rises in western Montana. The river drains an area of , mostly through the Clark Fork and its tributaries in western Montana and including a portion of the Flathead River in southeastern British Columbia. The full drainage basin of the river and its tributaries accounts for 43% of the entire Columbia River Basin above the confluence with the Columbia. The total area of the Pend Oreille basin is just under 10% of the entire Columbia Basin. Box Canyon Dam is currently underway on a multimillion-dollar project for a fish ladder.

==Course==
The Pend Oreille River begins at Lake Pend Oreille in Bonner County, Idaho in the Idaho Panhandle, draining the lake from its western end near Sandpoint (The Clark Fork River enters the lake from its eastern end). It flows west, receiving the Priest River from the north at the town of Priest River, then flows into southern Pend Oreille County in northeastern Washington at Newport. Once in Washington it turns north, flowing along the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. It flows roughly parallel to the Idaho border for approximately , through the Colville National Forest, past Tiger and Metaline Falls. It crosses the international border into southeastern British Columbia, looping west for about and joining the Columbia from the east, approximately north of the international border and approximately south of Montrose.

==Watershed==
Spreading across , the Pend Oreille River watershed stretches across most of western Montana, northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, as well as tiny portions in southern British Columbia drained by the North Fork Flathead River and the lower Pend Oreille River. Much of the southern drainage divide of the watershed forms the border of Idaho and Montana, and a very short portion of the northeastern divide forms the border of British Columbia and Alberta. The river is sometimes considered as one with the Clark Fork, which is the primary river flowing into Lake Pend Oreille. For example, in Stewart Holbrook&#x27;s book &quot;The Columbia&quot;, he repeatedly refers to the Pend Oreille River as the Clark Fork. If the lengths of the North Fork Flathead, main Flathead, Clark Fork and Pend Oreille are added together, the total is over stretching from the Rocky Mountains north of Glacier National Park to the Canada-U.S. border south of Montrose, British Columbia. This makes the Pend Oreille system the second longest tributary of the Columbia River (after the Snake River). It is the fourth largest by discharge (after the Snake, Kootenay and Willamette Rivers) and drains the second largest area (second only to the Snake).

The Pend Oreille River watershed divide is formed on the east side by the Continental Divide. On the south, the Spokane River and Snake River drainage basins border on the Clark Fork. To the west smaller rivers such as the Colville River and tributaries of the Spokane drain the lands past the watershed divide. In the north is the Kootenay River, a similar-sized tributary of the Columbia. To the east, in Montana, is the Missouri River and tributaries such as the Marias River and Milk River. In the southwest the watershed borders on the Big Hole River and Jefferson River, headwater streams of the Missouri. The Pend Oreille/Clark Fork system is notable in that it cuts right between the Bitterroot Range and Selkirk Range, two major chains of the Rocky Mountains. The only other river to do so is the Kootenay, just to the north. The Rocky Mountain Trench runs across the northeast part of the watershed, through the Flathead Valley, and eventually terminating in mountains near the Clark Fork&#x27;s confluence with the Flathead.

==Tributaries==
The Pend Oreille River starts in northern Idaho, at Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho&#x27;s largest lake. Cocolalla Creek is the first major tributary. The next one is the Priest River, this is long, and has three rivers flowing into it. Sullivan Creek is the last big tributary. The Clark Fork is also considered a tributary, as is the Pack.

==Geology==

Much of the Pend Oreille valley consists of relatively ancient metamorphic rock, uplifted over 500 million years ago from the former floor of the Precambrian sea that covered the region during that period. Granite batholiths overlain by layers of sedimentary rock compose most of the higher terrain, such as the Cabinet Mountains. The age of the rocks along the Pend Oreille generally decreases as one travels downstream (north), and the terrain is also more rugged towards the north than in the south. About 200 million years ago, increased tectonic activity caused the uplift of the Idaho Batholith, a portion of which cooled and eroded to become the present main body of the Bitterroot Range, a major physiographic feature of the watershed which sweeps from northwest to southeast along the entire Clark Fork valley (and the border of Idaho and Montana), by about 70 million years ago. This time period is generally accepted as when the entire Rocky Mountains system was formed, although age of the rocks varies with location.

In the previous Ice Age, a massive glacier of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet advanced southwards through the Idaho Panhandle, burying the Lake Pend Oreille and upper Pend Oreille River valley with ice hundreds to thousands of feet thick. This formed a pair of ice dams, one gigantic, and one significantly smaller. The one that caused the water of the Clark Fork and other smaller streams to back up into Glacial Lake Missoula, which stretched over two hundred miles southwest across western Montana, containing some of water, was over high. The second one blocked the upper Pend Oreille River near Sandpoint, creating an enlarged Lake Pend Oreille that could have connected with a similarly enlarged Kootenay Lake in the north. Water pressure and glacial melt destroyed the larger of the two ice dams several times, causing massive amounts of water to rush out across eastern Washington through the upper Pend Oreille River. A mistaken belief is that these cataclysmic floods, known as the Missoula Floods, traveled down the Pend Oreille Valley into the Columbia. Rather, it is now thought that the water completely breached the western divide of the Pend Oreille River valley and rushed out towards the direction of Spokane.

==History==
Native people who lived along the river included the Pend d&#x27;Oreilles and Kalispel (considered as a single tribe by the Bureau of Indian Affairs). Archaeological evidence suggests that people lived in the region as early as the end of the last ice age, about 11,000-12,000 years ago. The name &quot;Pend d&#x27;Oreille&quot; or &quot;Pend Oreille&quot; is variously stated to mean &quot;earring&quot;, &quot;hang from ears&quot;, or &quot;shape of an ear&quot;. &quot;Kalispel&quot; is thought to mean &quot;camas people&quot;, referring to the roots that provided their primary food. Both tribes lived around the area of Lake Pend Oreille occasionally ranging lower onto the Pend Oreille River (or maybe they did have settlements along the river?) but the lower (north) basin was generally less populated than the upper (south) portion. The Flathead tribe inhabited the upper (Clark Fork) part of the basin, especially the Bitterroot Valley. The Ktunaxa lived just to the east of the Pend Oreille river.

The first non-indigenous people to see the Pend Oreille were French-Canadian fur trappers working for various fur trading companies to provide beaver pelts to trade overseas. Some of these people were the ones to coin the term &quot;Pend d&#x27;Oreille&quot;. Canadian explorer David Thompson saw the river in 1807, after a long and arduous journey from Saskatchewan. His primary mission was to find the source of the Columbia River (Columbia Lake), which he did. Afterwards he proceeded to establish trading posts throughout the region, including Kullyspell House on the north shore of Lake Pend Oreille. In 1808, Thompson again traveled into the Pend Oreille region. The following spring, he tried to reach the Columbia River by way of the Pend Oreille, but rapids and waterfalls hampered his attempt. He ended up retreating to another trading post in British Columbia a few months later. After these early explorations, however, there still were no permanent white settlements along the Pend Oreille River.
By the 1840s, Europeans and Americans were pouring into the region in increasing numbers, although growth was slow. These newcomers did not strike good relations with the Native Americans of the area, and diseases such as smallpox wiped out many indigenous (this happened with many other tribes across North and Middle America as they were not used to such a sickness). After numerous wars and treaties, much of the land in the Pend Oreille basin especially the upper Clark Fork area had been ceded to the settlers. The last land in the Bitterroot area was given up in 1889, and many tribes of the Pend Oreille basin were moved to reservations in northwestern Montana. In the late 1850s, a major influx of non-indigenous peoples occurred when gold was discovered near Metaline Falls on the Pend Oreille River. The first major white settlements in that area, however, were not created until 1884. Mining for gold soon ceased but lead and zinc mining continued, reaching a peak in World War II when the metals were desperately needed for the productions of weapons, ships and planes.

In the 19th century, logging was the other major industry of the Pend Oreille River area and attracted hundreds to thousands of men to the region, many of them Scandinavian. Logging was profitable because almost the entire Pend Oreille watershed was forested with various types of trees. However, shipping logs to ports lower on the Columbia River (to the southwest of the Pend Oreille River) was a problem. Not only was the river riddled with frightening waterfalls and rapids, but it flows north, in the opposite direction that the logging companies wanted to move their logs. At about this time, steamboats were introduced to the Pend Oreille River. The first steamboat on the river was &quot;The Bertha&quot;, built in 1887 at Albeni Falls. Other well-known craft included &quot;Ione&quot;, &quot;Spokane&quot;, and &quot;Metaline&quot; (&quot;Pend Oreille&quot;). These boats carried passengers and ore and also towed log rafts up the river. (Since it flows north, they had to tow the logs south, against the current, to ship it a shorter distance to the lumber mills and factories lower in the Columbia Basin.) Navigation on the Pend Oreille presented few problems upstream of the Box Canyon rapids about three-fourths of the way down the Pend Oreille River (today close to the site of Box Canyon Dam). Many boats were wrecked in the stretch between Box Canyon and the river&#x27;s mouth (including &quot;Metaline&quot;, which was the only large steamer to operate on the lower river on a regular basis). After the Idaho &amp; Washington Northern Railroad was built in the area, steamboat commerce faded and the logs were transported by rail. The Idaho &amp; Washington Northern was eventually succeeded by the Milwaukee Road.

The Pend Oreille River valley was never easy for early or later emigrants to settle in. The little arable land that did exist was mostly within the river&#x27;s floodplain, and in many places there was only a narrow strip of flat ground that would soon run against vertical cliffs or dense forests with rocky soil. Nevertheless, some permanent settlements persisted, at Newport, Albeni Falls, Ione, Dalkena, Metaline Falls, Cusick, Usk, and many at the sites of the sawmills that cut the lumber extracted from the region. Some emigrants also settled along the Clark Fork, but there were similar problems because for most of its course, the Clark Fork, like the Pend Oreille, flows in a steep and narrow gorge. Larger numbers of people settled in the Flathead River valley, around Flathead Lake and Lake Pend Oreille, in the Priest River valley, and in the Bitterroot Valley of south-western Montana. Sandpoint (population 7,000), near where the river flows out of Lake Pend Oreille, remains the largest city in close proximity to the river.

==River modifications==

There are five hydroelectric dams on the Pend Oreille River: Waneta (owned by Teck Cominco) and Seven Mile (B.C. Hydro) dams in Canada, Boundary (Seattle City Light), Box Canyon, (Pend Oreille County PUD), and Albeni Falls (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) dams in the United States. The combined generating capacity of all the dams is approximately 2480 megawatts (MW). Boundary Dam has the largest generating capacity of the five, at 1070 MW. The smaller Albeni Falls Dam regulates the level of Lake Pend Oreille to provide some flood control during the summer and increased flows during dry winters. None of the dams provide for fish passage or navigation.

Numerous dams upstream along the Clark Fork (Cabinet Gorge, Noxon Rapids and Thompson Falls) and Flathead (SKQ/Flathead Lake and Hungry Horse) also generate power and to a lesser extent regulate the inflows to Lake Pend Oreille and the Pend Oreille River.

In the 1920s, there was a proposal to divert the Pend Oreille through a gravity canal to irrigate the Grand Coulee and surrounding lands in eastern Washington as part of the tentative Columbia Basin Project. These plans were later dropped with the construction of Grand Coulee Dam and a pumping plant on the Columbia River.

==Names==
Variant names, according to the USGS, include: Bitter Root River, Bitterroot River, Clark Fork, Clarke Fork, Clarkes Fork, Clarks Fork, Deer Lodge River, Hell Gate River, Missoula River, Pend d&#x27;Oreille River, Silver Bow River, Clark&#x27;s Fork, and Pend-d&#x27;Oreille River.

==Conservation==
*The Lake Pend Oreille, Pend Oreille River, Priest Lake and Priest River Commission otherwise known as the “Lakes Commission” formed to oversee any issues relating to water quality and/or water quantity in Lake Pend Oreille, Pend Oreille River, Priest Lake and Priest River Basin. 
As mitigation (mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee ‘FERC’) for the continued license/operation of the Boundary Dam on the Pend Oreille, Seattle City and Light had to provide mitigation funding. This mitigation funding came in the form of removing the high ‘Mill Pond Dam’ on Sullivan Creek just upstream of the town of Metaline Falls. Mill Pond Dam was removed in the summer of 2017 and the project finished in 2018 with stream and bank stabilization and native tree plantings. Sullivan Creek now runs free from its headwaters in the Salmon-Priest Wilderness to the Pend Oreille River. Native trout species will assuredly benefit by this habitat restoration.

== Recreation ==
The river is popular for boating and fishing.

The Pend Oreille River Trail covers from the Idaho/Washington border to Boundary Dam near the Canadian border. Maps can be found on the Pend Oreille County website. The river is popular for boating,

<text>Blera is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; in the northern Lazio region of Italy. It was known during the Middle Ages as Bieda, an evolved form of its ancient name, which was restored in the twentieth century. It is the birthplace of Pope Sabinian; Pope Paschal II was also originally thought to be from here.

It is situated on a long, narrow tongue of rock at the junction of two deep glens.

==History==
In ancient times, Blera was an Etruscan town on the Via Clodia. It was of little importance, and is known to be mentioned only by geographers and in inscriptions.

In 772, it was destroyed by the Lombards of King Desiderius. In the thirteenth-fifteenth centuries, it belonged to the Di Vico family. In 1247 the army of Frederick II ravaged it. In the fifteenth century, Pope Boniface IX gave Blera to the Anguillara family, who owned it until 1572, apart from a short period from 1465 under direct Papal control. Later it followed the history of the Papal States.

==Main sights==
Some remains of the town walls still exist, and also two ancient bridges, both belonging to the Via Clodia, and many tombs hewn in the rock with small chambers imitating the architectural forms of houses, and beams and rafters represented in relief.

===Selvasecca di Blera===

Eric Berggren and the Swedish Institute in Rome excavated a Republican period rural structure or villa at the site of Selvasecca di Blera between 1965 and 1967, with preliminary results published in 1969. The hill of Selvasecca lies about 6 km southwest of Blera itself. The villa site is marked by a courtyard building that includes a remarkable vaulted cistern built using &quot;opus caementicium&quot;. There is also evidence that architectural terracottas were produced at the site. The implications of the villa itself have been recently re-visited.

<doc id="704333" wikidata="Q3842409" url="?curid=704333" title="Madonna Inn">
<text>The Madonna Inn is a motel in San Luis Obispo, California. Opened for business in 1958, it quickly became a landmark on the Central Coast of California. It is noted for its unique decor, pink dining room, and themed rooms. It was created by Alex Madonna, a successful construction magnate and entrepreneur (d. April 2004), and his wife Phyllis. The inn includes a restaurant and bakery, and is located on the west side of US Route 101 and situated on the lower eastern portion of Cerro San Luis Obispo.

==Description==
The property is adorned with a pseudo-Swiss-Alps exterior and lavish common rooms accented by pink roses, Western murals, and hammered copper. The predominant exterior color is pink, which extends to the lamp posts and trash cans. Each of the 110 guest rooms and suites is uniquely designed and themed, though some tourists stop just to peek at the famous rock waterfall urinal located in the men&#x27;s restroom, a feature designed by Hollywood set designer Harvey Allen Warren.

The boulders used for the Inn weigh up to for the exterior and for the interior. A boulder is shared as a fireplace for the adjoining Madonna (#141) and Old World (#192) suites.

In 1973, there were five buildings on the site:
;Notes
Aiming to cater to a range of tastes, rooms were given unusual names, amenities, and themes such as &quot;Yahoo&quot; (#132), &quot;Love Nest&quot; (#183), &quot;Old Mill&quot; (#206), &quot;Kona Rock&quot; (#131), &quot;Irish Hills&quot; (#156), &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; (#161), &quot;Just Heaven&quot; (#184), &quot;Hearts &amp; Flowers&quot; (#155), &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; (#143), &quot;Austrian Suite&quot; (#160), &quot;Cabin Still&quot; (#133), &quot;Old World Suite&quot; (#192), &quot;Caveman Room&quot; (#137), &quot;Elegance&quot; (#201), &quot;Daisy Mae&quot; (#138), &quot;Safari Room&quot; (#193), &quot;Highway Suite&quot; (#145), &quot;Jungle Rock&quot; (#139), &quot;American Home&quot; (#204), &quot;Bridal Falls&quot; (#140), and &quot;the Carin&quot; (#218). Some rooms are grouped in themes. For example, the rooms &quot;Ren&quot; (#167), &quot;Dez&quot; (#168), and &quot;Vous&quot; (#169) are a play on the French word &quot;rendezvous&quot;, and &quot;Merry&quot; (#164), &quot;Go&quot; (#165), and &quot;Round&quot; (#166), for an amusement park carousel. Most of the themes were conceived by Alex and Phyllis Madonna, and some rooms were designed by Disney artist Alice Turney Williams.

== History ==
The Madonna Inn opened as a motel inn on December 24, 1958 upon the completion of its first twelve rooms. The Madonnas were so excited to have their first guest, they refunded his $7 room rental. Demand was sufficient to expand to forty rooms in 1959, and the Inn facility was constructed in 1960. Reportedly, when the architect Richard Neutra stayed at the Inn, he asked Alex Madonna about the design: &quot;Alex, you didn&#x27;t have an architect here, did you? It&#x27;s just as well you didn&#x27;t because you couldn&#x27;t have captured all the details if you had to draw them out. I don&#x27;t know how you would draw these things and then accomplish them.&quot;
In May 1966, the Inn&#x27;s original units were burned to the ground in a fire. It reopened a year later, and by the end of the decade, all of the rooms had been rebuilt in manner for which they are known today. There are 110 rooms.

In 1975, critic Paul Goldberger wrote an article about the Madonna Inn for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, bringing it to national prominence. By 1982, the Madonna Inn was already well-known, and Alex Madonna was quoted as saying, &quot;Anybody can build one room and a thousand like it. It&#x27;s more economical. Most places try to give you as little as possible. I try to give people a decent place to stay where they receive more than they are entitled to for what they&#x27;re paying. I want people to come in with a smile and leave with a smile. It&#x27;s fun.&quot;

Hanna-Barbera Productions sued the Madonna Inn in 1983, alleging copyright infringement over the Inn&#x27;s &quot;Flintstone Room&quot; (#139) and its decorations, which included images of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and the exclamation &quot;Yabba Dabba Doo&quot;. Room #139 is now the &quot;Jungle Rock&quot; junior suite. According to a 2013 interview with Clint Pearce, president of Madonna Enterprises, the &quot;Caveman Room&quot; (#137) was originally the &quot;Flintstone Room&quot;.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
* The &quot;Rigoletto&quot; segment of the movie &quot;Aria&quot; (1987) was shot around the hotel.

<text>José Gabriel Condorcanqui ( – 18 May 1781)known as Tupaq Amaru IIwas an Indigenous leader who led a large Andean rebellion against the Spanish in Peru as self-proclaimed Sapa Inca of a new Inca Empire. He later became a mythical figure in the Peruvian struggle for independence and indigenous rights movement, as well as an inspiration to a myriad of causes in Spanish America and beyond.

==Early life==
Tupaq Amaru II was born José Gabriel Condorcanqui Noguera in around 1742 in Surimana, Tungasuca, in the province of Cusco, to Miguel Condorcanqui Usquionsa Tupaq Amaru, &quot;kuraka&quot; of three towns in the Tinta district, and María Rosa Noguera. On May 1, Tupaq Amaru II was baptized by Santiago José Lopez in a church in Tungasuca. Prior to his father&#x27;s death, Amaru II spent his childhood in the Vilcamayu Valley; he accompanied his father to community functions, such as the temple, the market, and processions. Tupac&#x27;s parents died when he was twelve years old, and he was raised by an aunt and uncle. When he was 16, he received a Jesuit education at the &quot;San Francisco de Borja&quot; School, founded to educate the sons of &quot;kurakas&quot;. The Jesuits &quot;impressed upon him his social standing as future &quot;kuraka&quot; and someone of royal Inca blood.&quot; When he was 22, Amaru II married Micaela Bastidas. Shortly after his marriage, Amaru II succeeded his father as &quot;kuraka&quot;, giving him rights to land. As with his father, he was both the head of several Quechua communities and a regional merchant and muleteer, inheriting 350 mules from his father&#x27;s estate. His regional trading gave him contacts in many other indigenous communities and access to information about economic conditions. His personal contacts and knowledge of the region were useful in the rebellion of 1780–81.

He was recognized as an elite Quechua from a &quot;kuraka&quot; family and was educated at a school in Cuzco for sons of indigenous leaders. He spoke Quechua and Spanish and learned Latin from the Jesuits. He was upwardly socially mobile, and in Cuzco he had connections with distinguished Spanish and Spanish American (creole) residents. &quot;The upper classes in Lima saw him as a well-educated Indian&quot;.

Between 1776 and 1780 Condorcanqui went into litigation with the Betancur family over the right of succession of the Marquisate of Oropesa and lost the case. In 1760, he married Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua of Afro-Peruvian and indigenous descent. Amaru II inherited the caciqueship, or hereditary chiefdom of Tungasuca and Pampamarca from his older brother, governing on behalf of the Spanish governor.

At the end of the 1770s, the trade relations between Buenos Aires and the Upper Peru ended with the commercial monopoly of Lima, which caused greater competition for the manufacturers of Cuzco. They needed to sell their merchandise in Potosí but had to compete with producers of Buenos Aires and even of Spain. On the other hand, the widespread overproduction throughout the Andes pushed prices down. Furthermore, in the years 1778 and 1779, extremely cold weather damaged crops and made travel difficult. In 1780, Amaru, who also experienced this crisis, had considerable resources but also numerous debts. He also witnessed the economic discomforts the others were going through, from merchants who were on the brink of bankruptcy to communities that could not afford the growing tribute.

Condorcanqui lived the typical situation of the &quot;kurakas&quot; (tribal chiefs): he had to mediate between the local commander and the indigenous people in his charge. However, he was affected, like the rest of the population, due to the establishment of customs and the rise of the &quot;alcabalas&quot; (taxes). He voiced his objection against these issues. He also demanded that the indigenous people be freed from compulsory work in the mines. claims directed through the regular channels to the colonial authorities in Tinta, Cusco and later in Lima, obtaining negatives or indifference.

In addition, he adopted the name Tupaq Amaru II, in honor of his ancestor Tupaq Amaru I, the last Sapa Inca of the Neo-Inca State, seeking to be recognized for his royal Inca lineage.
== The &quot;Corregidores&quot; and the exploitation of the natives ==
Although the Spanish trusteeship labor system, or &quot;encomienda&quot;, had been abolished in 1720, a seventh of the population living in native communities (pueblos de indios) as well as permanent indigenous workers at the time living in the Andean region of what is now Ecuador and Bolivia, who made up nine tenths of the population, were still pushed into forced labor for what were legally labeled as public work projects. This shift from the encomienda to the state sponsored and controlled draft labor system consolidated the indigenous labor force in the hands of the local government and not in the individual encomenderos. Most natives worked under the supervision of a master either tilling soil, mining or working in textile mills. What little wage that was acquired by workers was heavily taxed and cemented Native American indebtedness to Spanish masters. The Roman Catholic Church also had a hand in extorting these natives through collections for saints, masses for the dead, domestic and parochial work on certain days, forced gifts, etc. Those not employed in forced labor were still subject to the Spanish provincial governors, or &quot;corregidores&quot; who also heavily taxed and overpriced commodities to any free natives, similarly ensuring their financial instability.

In addition, the middle of the 18th century mining production intensified, putting more and more of a burden on the &quot;mita,&quot; or draft labor, system. While Potosi&#x27;s mining &quot;mita&quot; had already been dangerous and labor-intensive work as well as forcing a migration by both the native worker and sometimes their families to Potosi to work, the labor became more extractive during this time, even though no new veins of ore had been discovered. Indeed, many future rebellious areas centered around Potosi and the mining district.

Condorcanqui&#x27;s interest in the Native American cause had been spurred by the re-reading of one of the &quot;Royal Commentaries of the Incas&quot;, a romantic and heroic account of the history and culture of the ancient Incas. The book was outlawed at the time by the Lima viceroy for fear of it inspiring renewed interest in the lost Inca culture and inciting rebellion. The marquis&#x27;s native pride coupled with his hate for the Spanish colonial system, caused him to sympathize and frequently petition for the improvement of native labor in the mills, farms and mines; even using his own wealth to help alleviate the taxes and burdens of the natives. After many of his requests for the alleviation of the native conditions fell on deaf ears, Condorcanqui decided to organize a rebellion. He began to stall on collecting reparto debts and tribute payments, for which the Tinta &quot;corregidor&quot; and governor Antonio de Arriaga threatened him with death. Condorcanqui changed his name to Tupaq Amaru II and claimed he was descended from the last Inca ruler, Tupaq Amaru.

==Rebellion==

The Tupaq Amaru rebellion was an Inca revival movement that sought to improve the rights of indigenous Peruvians suffering under the Spanish Bourbon Reforms. The rebellion was one of many indigenous Peruvian uprisings in the latter half of the 18th century. It began with the capture and killing of the Tinta Corregidor and Governor Antonio de Arriaga on November 4, 1780, after a banquet attended by both Tupaq Amaru II and Governor Arriaga. The immediate cause of the rebellion lay in grievances caused by a series of modernising reforms of the colonial administration implemented by the Bourbon monarchy in Spain under Charles III (1759–88), centralising administrative and economic control and placing heavier tax and labour burdens on both the Indian and Creole populations. The focus of discontent was the main representative of the crown in Peru, the visitador general José Antonio Areche. Ideologically, the rebellion was complex. At one level, it expressed simply a demand on the Spanish authorities for changes and reforms within the structure of colonial rule, often speaking in the name of the king himself, for example. At another, it envisioned an overthrow of European rule, and something like a restoration of the pre-conquest Inca empire, the Tahuantinsuyo. Tupaq Amaru&#x27;s claim to be the legitimate descendant of the Inca suggested the possibility of an aristocratic state similar to the one envisioned in the sixteenth century by the mestizo writer, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who saw the Incas as sharing rule with the Spanish aristocracy. But there were also strong millenarian, proto-Jacobin and even proto-communist elements in the rebellion. In the main, the soldiers of the Tupamarista armies were poor Indian peasants, artisans and women, who saw the rebellion not so much as a question of reforms or power sharing but as an opportunity to &#x27;turn the world upside down&#x27;. The restoration of the Inca Empire meant for them the possibility of an egalitarian society, based economically on the Inca communal agricultural system, the ayllu, and one without castas (racial divisions), rich and poor, or forced labour in haciendas, mines and factories, particularly the dreaded textile mills.&quot;

When Arriaga left the party drunk, Tupaq Amaru II and several of his allies captured him and forced him to write letters to a large number of Spaniards and kurakas. When about 200 of them gathered within the next few days, Tupaq Amaru II surrounded them with approximately 4,000 natives. Claiming that he was acting under direct orders from the Spanish Crown, Amaru II gave Arriaga&#x27;s slave Antonio Oblitas the privilege of executing his master. A platform in the middle of a local town plaza was erected, and the initial attempt at hanging the &quot;corregidor&quot; failed when the noose snapped. Arriaga then ran for his life to try to reach a nearby church, but was not quick enough to escape, and was successfully hanged on the second attempt.

After the execution of de Arriaga, Amaru II continued his insurrection. Releasing his first proclamation, Tupaq Amaru II announced, &quot;that there have been repeated outcries directed to me by the indigenous peoples of this and surrounding provinces, outcries against the abuses committed by European-born crown officials... Justified outcries that have produced no remedy from the royal courts&quot; to all the inhabitants of the Spanish provinces. He went on in the same proclamation to state, &quot;I have acted ... only against the mentioned abuses and to preserve the peace and well-being of Indians, mestizos, mambos, as well as native-born whites and blacks. I must now prepare for the consequences of these actions.&quot; Tupac Amaru II then went on to quickly assemble an army of 6,000 natives who had abandoned their work to join the revolt. As they marched towards Cuzco, the rebels occupied the provinces of Quispicanchis, Tinta, Cotabambas, Calca, and Chumbivilcas. The rebels looted the Spaniards&#x27; houses and killed their occupants. The movement was supremely anti-royalist since, upon arriving at a town the rebels would upturn Spanish authority.

&quot;Women, as much as men, were affected by these injustices.&quot; In fact, Tupaq Amaru II&#x27;s wife, Micaela Bastidas, commanded a battalion of insurgents and was responsible for the uprising in the San Felipe de Tungasuca region. She is also often credited to being more daring and a superior strategist, compared to Tupaq Amaru II. It is told that she scolded her husband for his weakness and refusal to set up a surprise attack against the Spaniards in Cusco to catch the weakened city defenders off guard. Instead of listening to his wife, Tupaq Amaru II lost precious time by encircling the country in hopes that he could gather more recruits for his army. So, by the time the insurgents had attacked the city, the Spaniards had already brought in reinforcements and were able to control and stop the uprising. This led to Tupaq Amaru II, Micaela Bastidas, and several others to be captured while the rebels scattered.

During a stage of his rebellion, Tupaq Amaru II was able to convince the Quechua speakers to join him. Therefore, under his command, the Quechua speakers fought alongside him with Aymara-speaking rebels from Puno on Lake Titicaca and on the Bolivian side of the lake. Unfortunately, the alliance did not last that long and this led the Aymara leader, Túpac Katari, to lead his army alone which ultimately led to his capture in October 1781. His partner and female commander, Bartola Sisa, took control after his capture and lead an astonishing number of 2,000 soldiers for several months. Soon after that in early 1782, the Spanish military defeated the rebels in Peru and Bolivia. According to modern sources, out of the 73 leaders, 32 were women, who were all executed privately.

On November 18, 1780, Cusco dispatched over 1,300 Spanish and Native loyalist troops. The two opposing forces clashed in the town of Sangarará. It was an absolute victory for Amaru II and his Native rebels; all 578 Spanish soldiers were killed and the rebels took possession of their weapons and supplies. The victory however, also came with a price. The battle revealed that Amaru II was unable to fully control his rebel followers, as they viciously slaughtered without direct orders. Reports of such violence and the rebels&#x27; insistence on the death of Spaniards eliminated any chances for support by the &quot;Criollo&quot; class. The victory achieved at Sangarará would be followed by a string of defeats. The gravest defeat came in Amaru II&#x27;s failure to capture Cuzco, where his 40,000 – 60,000 indigenous followers were repelled by the fortified town consisting of a combined force of loyalist Native troops and reinforcements from Lima. &quot;After being repelled from the capital of the ancient Inca empire and intellectual hub of colonial Peru&quot; Amaru and his men marched through the countryside attempting to recruit any native to his cause, in doing so bolstering his forces. Amaru II&#x27;s army was surrounded between Tinta and Sangarara and he was betrayed by two of his officers, Colonel Ventura Landaeta and Captain Francisco Cruz, which led to his capture. When his captors attempted to procure the names of his rebel accomplices from him in exchange for promises, Amaru II scornfully replied &quot;There are no accomplices here other than you and I. You as oppressor, I as liberator, deserve to die.&quot;
=== Death ===
Amaru II was sentenced to be executed. He was forced to watch the deaths of his wife Micaela Bastidas, his eldest son Hipólito, his uncle Francisco Tupa Amaro, his brother-in-law Antonio Bastidas, and some of his captains before his own death.

On May 18, 1781, they were taken to the Plaza de Armas in Cuzco to be executed one by one. His son Hipólito first had his tongue cut out, for having spoken against the Spanish, and then he was hanged. Micaela and José Gabriel were forced to witness the death of their son; Micaela was then made to climb to the platform. In front of her husband and her son Fernando, Micaela fought against her executioners until they finally subdued her and cut off her tongue. Her thin neck could not reach the winch, so they threw ties around her neck that pulled it from side to side to strangle her. They hit her with a club and finally killed her with kicks in the stomach and breasts.

The following is an extract from the official judicial death issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Tupaq Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered that Tupaq Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out after watching the executions of his family and to have his hands and feet tied:
After the failed dismemberment by the four horses, his body was quartered, and he was then beheaded on the main plaza in Cuzco, in the same place his ancestor Tupaq Amaru I had been beheaded.

His youngest son, 10-year-old Fernando, was not executed but was forced to witness the torture and death of his entire family and to pass under the gallows of those executed. He was later exiled to Africa for life imprisonment. However, the ship taking him there was capsized and he ended up in Cádiz to be imprisoned in the dungeons of the city. Viceroy Agustín de Jáuregui suggested that he should be kept in Spain, fearing that some enemy power might rescue him on the way to Africa.

Scientists who have studied this dismemberment attempt concluded that due to the physical build and resistance of Tupaq Amaru II, it would not have been possible to dismember him in that way. However, his arms and legs were dislocated, as was his pelvis.

Despite the execution of Tupaq Amaru II and his family, the vice regal government failed to quell the rebellion, which continued under the leadership of his cousin Diego Cristóbal Tupaq Amaru at the same time that it extended through Upper Peru and the Jujuy region. Likewise, disaffection of the Spanish Crown towards the Creoles became evident, especially for the Oruro Case. The lawsuit were filed against Juan José Segovia, born in Lima, and Colonel Ignacio Flores, born in Quito, who had served as president of the Real Audiencia of Charcas and as the Governor Intendant of La Plata (Chuquisaca or Charcas, currently Sucre).

=== Aftermath ===

When the revolt continued, the Spaniards executed the remainder of his family, except his 12-year-old son Fernando, who had been condemned to die with him, but was instead imprisoned in Spain for the rest of his life. It is not known if any members of the Inca royal family survived this final purge. Amaru&#x27;s body parts were strewn across the towns loyal to him as ordered, his houses were demolished, their sites strewn with salt, his goods confiscated, his relatives declared infamous, and all documents relating to his descent burnt.

At the same time, on May 18, 1781, Incan clothing and cultural traditions, and self-identification as &quot;Inca&quot; were outlawed, along with other measures to convert the population to Western European Spanish culture and government until Peru&#x27;s independence as a republic. However, even after the death of Amaru, Native revolts still seized much of what is today southern Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, as Native revolutionaries captured Spanish towns and beheaded many inhabitants. In one instance, a Native-American army under rebel leader Túpac Katari besieged the city of La Paz for 109 days before troops sent from Buenos Aires stepped in to relieve the city.

=== Consequences ===

Although Tupaq Amaru II&#x27;s rebellion was not a success, it marked the first large-scale rebellion in the Spanish colonies and inspired the revolt of many Natives and Peruvians in the surrounding area. The rebellion took on important manifestations in &quot;Upper Peru&quot; or what is today modern Bolivia including the region South and East of Lake Titicaca. Indeed, Tupaq Amaru II inspired the indigenous peoples to such an extent that even the official document wherein he is condemned to death, it is remarked that &quot;the Indians stood firm in the place of our gunfire, despite their enormous fear of it&quot; and that despite being captured, his followers remained steadfast in their beliefs in his immortality and heritage.

The rebellion gave indigenous Peruvians a new state of mind, a sort of indigenous nationalism that would re-emerge and change shape over the course of the country&#x27;s future. They were now willing to join forces with anyone who opposed the Spanish. As well, few Peruvians had prosperous co-owned businesses and land with the Spaniards, and as such did not want to lose those interests in the event of a revolution. While Tupaq Amaru II&#x27;s revolt was spawned in the Vilcanota Valley and ended in the city of Cuzco, the legacy and ideology of his revolt had echoes throughout the Andean region.

==Quotations==
&quot;Querrán volarlo y no podrán volarlo&quot; (&quot;They will want to blow him up and won&#x27;t be able to blow him up&quot;).&lt;br&gt;&quot;Querrán romperlo y no podrán romperlo&quot; (&quot;They will want to break him and won&#x27;t be able to break him&quot;).&lt;br&gt;&quot;Querrán matarlo y no podrán matarlo&quot; (&quot;They will want to kill him and won&#x27;t be able to kill him&quot;). &lt;br&gt;&quot;Al tercer día de los sufrimientos, cuando se creía todo consumado, gritando: ¡LIBERTAD! sobre la tierra, ha de volver. ¡Y no podrán matarlo!&quot; (&quot;On the third day of suffering, when it was believed everything was finished, he will scream: FREEDOM! over the land must return. And they won&#x27;t be able to kill him!&quot;) &lt;br&gt; — Alejandro Romualdo

== Recognition ==

The fame of Tupaq Amaru II spread to such an extent that for the indigenous rebels in the plains of Casanare in the New Granada region, he was recognized as &quot;King of America&quot;.

Later movements invoked the name of Tupaq Amaru II to obtain the support of the indigenous, among others, Felipe Velasco Tupaq Amaru Inca or Felipe Velasco Túpac Inca Yupanqui, who wanted to rise up in Huarochirí (Lima) in 1783. The rebellion of Tupaq Amaru II marked the beginning of the Peruvian War of Independence in the history of Peru.

This great rebellion produced a strong influence on the Conspiracy of the Tres Antonios which came up in Chile on January 1, 1781, at the height of the insurrection. They were encouraged to act hearing the news of the advances of Tupaq Amaru II in the Viceroyalty of Peru.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In Peru, the government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968-1975) welcomed the formalized effigy of Tupaq Amaru II as a symbol of the Gobierno Revolucionario de la Fuerza Armada (Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces) that he headed, to date, the only government of leftist ideology in the history of Peru. He recognized him as a national hero. In 1968, which was a novelty since independence the symbol of Tupaq Amaru II was carried by Peruvian education and official historiography. In his honor one of the main rooms of the Government Palace was named after him. That room until then was Francisco Pizarro room and that his picture was replaced by that of the indigenous rebel.

<text>Seed beads or rocailles are uniformly shaped, spheroidal beads ranging in size from under a millimeter to several millimeters. &quot;Seed bead&quot; is also a generic term for any small bead. Usually rounded in shape, seed beads are most commonly used for loom and off-loom bead weaving. They may be used for simple stringing, or as spacers between other beads in jewelry.

Larger seed beads are used in various fiber crafts for embellishment, or crochet with fiber or soft, flexible wire. The largest size of a seed bead is 1/0 (&quot;one-aught&quot;, sometimes written 1/°) and the smallest is 24/0, about the size of a grain of sand. However, seed beads that are size 5/0 or 6/0 are usually called &quot;pony beads&quot; rather than &quot;seed beads&quot;; the next larger class of seed beads, from 3/0 to 4/0, are usually called &quot;trade beads&quot;; the largest class of seed beads, including 1/0, 2/0, and anything larger, are usually referred to as &quot;crow beads.&quot; The range of seed beads in most modern seed bead work covers the sizes 6/0, 8/0, 11/0, 12/0, 13/0 and 15/0. Sizes 6/0, 8/0 and 11/0 are often used in beaded knitting, as well as bead knitting. The extremely small class of seed beads smaller than 15/0 have not been in production since the 1890s and any in existence are usually considered antiques.

The very small holes in the centers of most seed beads means that stringing them usually requires the use of a specialized long narrow needle called a beading needle.

==Construction techniques==
Two principal techniques are used to produce seed beads: the wound method and the drawn method. The wound method is the more-traditional technique, is more time-consuming, and is no longer used in modern bead production: in this technique, a chunk of glass known in glassmaking as a gather and composed mainly of silica is heated on an iron bar until molten. A second bar of iron is then inserted into the gather and the two bars quickly drawn apart creating a long glass rod (the final width of which would depend on how quickly and how far the bars are separated before the glass solidifies). This rod is then cut into shorter rods for handling. Next, one of these is re-heated and wound around a hot metal wire creating a ring of glass which is then worked and shaped until smooth and round. This is done several times on the same wire creating a series of glass rings. Once the wire cools, the rings are slipped off and then used as beads. For the drawn method, an air bubble is created within the gather and as the iron bars are drawn apart they produce a long tube rather than a rod. This tube is then cooled, cut into rings, and the rings are tumbled to remove sharp edges before being used as beads.

==Varieties==
=== National origin ===
Before World War II, there was a thriving bead industry centered in eastern Europe, especially in Bohemia, before 1918 a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and a part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia after, although Germany, Italy and France were also noted producers of glass beads. Most of these beads were made of glass, but some were made of metal, usually aluminum or steel, and often cut in what is known as &quot;three-cut&quot; faceting; these are popularly known as steel cuts. Many of the old factories were converted or destroyed during World War II. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, treasure troves of old beads made their way to Western markets. These &quot;vintage&quot; beads are highly prized, and are now harder to find.

Most contemporary high-quality seed beads are made in Japan, India, or the Czech Republic. Japanese seed beads are generally more uniform in size, shape, and finish as well as having larger holes than Czech seed beads of the same size, but the Japanese make fewer styles.

Some seed beads produced in France are available in historic &quot;old-time&quot; colors and are popular for use in repairing or replicating antiquities.

Lesser quality seed beads are produced in India, in People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and in Taiwan. Beads from these countries are less uniform in shape, hole size and finish. Dyed seed beads may transfer the dye to clothing or skin. Other seed beads have an external coating that will rub away to reveal a completely different color underneath.

Generally, less expensive beads are more susceptible to the ravages of time no matter their country of origin.
=== Colors and finishes ===
* Color lined - a color coating is applied inside the beads; sometimes this is not very durable and the color of finished work may appear very different in a short time
* Transparent - the glass is see-through
* Translucent - one can see light through the bead, although the light is diffused
* Opaque - the solid color prevents light from passing through the bead
* Matte - the bead is textured on a microscopic level to result in a matte finish
* Silver-lined - a silvery coating which reflects light is applied to the inside of the seed bead
* Copper-lined - a coppery coating which reflects a reddish light is applied to the inside of the seed bead
* Bronze-lined - a bronzy coating which reflects a brown light is applied to the inside of the seed bead
* Luster or lustre - a transparent &quot;pearl&quot; effect applied to the surface of the seed bead
* AB or aurora borealis - a rainbow effect applied to the surface of a seed bead

Formulas for different colors of glass are closely guarded. The recipe for a true black glass was lost during World War I, and modern black glass held to sunlight is a deep purple. Examples of true black glass are circulating in jewelry pieces made to commemorate the funeral of Queen Victoria.

Glass rods made with concentric layers of color or stripes of color can be used to make patterns of color in seed beads.

Seed bead machinery uses glass rods softened to a red heat, fed into a steel die stamp that forms the shape of the bead with a reciprocating needle that forms the hole. Manual and automatic machinery is in use in the Czech Republic. As the steel dies wear eventually, they are replaced.

=== Cylinder beads ===

During the last few decades, a new shape of Japanese seed bead, the cylinder bead, has become increasingly popular. They were invented by Masayoshi Katsuoka of the Miyuki Shoji Company in the 1980s. Unlike the more rounded donut-shaped rocaille seed beads, cylinder beads have large holes for their size, and their diameters, inside and out, have little variation. Their flattened ends mean that bead work created with cylinder beads has a flat, smooth texture. Rows and columns in weaving line up more uniformly, so detailed pattern work comes out more accurate and even. These beads are more expensive than round seed beads, although the reduced weight of the thin walled cylinder beads results in more beads per gram.

There are three versions of cylinder beads: 
* Delica by Miyuki. Delicas are currently (2018) made in four sizes: 15/0 (the smallest), 11/0, 10/0, and 8/0. Delica varieties include a &quot;cut&quot; Delica that reflects light from flat facets.
* Treasures (formerly Antiques) by Toho available in size 11/0
* Aiko by Toho, introduced in 2005, available in size 11/0

=== Cut beads ===

One cut or true cut beads have a flat surface cut into the bead that produces a shine or sparkle when reflecting light. Cut beads that are size 13/0 are referred to as &quot;Charlottes.&quot; However, many people refer to all single cut beads as Charlotte cut.

There are three-cut beads which are &quot;barrel faceted&quot;, meaning they start with a round bead and make more random machine cuts, creating a nugget like bead. Then in a class of their own is the two-cut seed bead. These never started out as a round bead, but rather the raw cane has been shaved and cut.

=== Bugle beads ===

Bugle beads are longer than they are thick, creating a tubular shape. They have different lengths ranging from 2mm, 3mm to 35mm in length, and may be plain, twisted or faceted (cut). The smallest, #0 at 2mm, is produced by the Toho company.

Bugle beads are sold by size (length) commonly designated as #1 - 3mm, #2 - 4mm, #3 - 6mm, #4 -12mm, and larger (longer) without a number designation, i.e. 30mm, 35mm. The Miyuki bead company designates their bugle beads as #1 - 3mm, #2 - 6mm, #3 - 9mm, #4 - 12mm.

Bugle beads may have round or square holes, which are from .6mm to 1.2mm, getting larger as the length increases.

The style and or finish of bugle beads correspond to the range of styles produced by each company. Many companies provide sample cards which can be viewed digitally on their websites.

==Units of measure==
The aught system of classifying seed beads is widely used but is imprecise and variable between manufacturers. The measurements given below for bead diameter are meant to suggest the industry standard but are not absolute—in fact, variation from one manufacturer to the next may be greater than the variation within a single aught-size of bead.

The aught size of a bead is usually given either as a number followed by a superscripted zero, e.g., 8°, or most often as a number followed by a slash and a zero, e.g., 8/0. Regardless, this is spoken as, &quot;Eight aught&quot;, though the &quot;aught&quot; portion is regularly ignored and an 8/0 size seed bead would usually be described as simply as &quot;Size eight&quot; or &quot;an 8 bead.&quot;

==Methods of packaging==
Seed beads are sold either by hank, gram weight or tube. Style of glass (opaque, transparent, matte) and finish, color, and name may (or may not) be listed along with the companies product number. Names (colors) are often created by the retailer to entice purchases, and vary by retailer. A few carry over from the manufacturers and are used by most retailers: African Sunset Gold #329 by Toho is one example.

=== Hanks ===
A hank is unit bundle of strands of seed beads or bugle beads. A typical hank has twelve 20&quot; (51 cm) strands of beads. Different sizes and types of beads may be sold in hanks which have different numbers and lengths of strands. Different hanks (age, type, size) have from 8 to 14 strands, and lengths vary from 8 to 20 inches per strand. For example, Charlotte size 13/0 cut beads are generally on short hanks, containing 12 twelve-inch strands. Some vintage 18/0 hanks have 10 strands of 8–10 inches (200 to 250 mm) each. 1 hank = 3.333 fathoms = 6.667 yards = 20 feet = 6096mm = 609.6 cm = 6.096 meters = x grams.

Czech seed beads are sold from the factories by boxes, bags or strands. They are often repackaged into hanks, tubes, or other containers for retail sale, in quantities varying from 5 grams to 40 or more grams. When Czech beads are repackaged, they are usually sold by the gram, which creates some confusion on how many beads come on a hank. Not every 20 inch strand of size 11/0 beads weighs the same. However, there are some online calculators, which can be used for conversion from hanks to grams and from grams to hanks.

A hank of size 2/0 bugles or size 11/0 seed beads generally weighs between 30 and 40 grams, depending on manufacturing variations, coatings or linings. Purchasing Czech beads by the hank is usually a better value than repackaged beads.

A production run of a custom made seed bead is eight kilograms. The beads are produced in the Czech Republic using a ten kilogram rod of color glass. The excess glass is recycled to form new rods. The color glass rods are produced from a larger mass melt of some ten metric tons.

=== Weight ===

Japanese beads are sold by gram weight, seldom by the hank. Buying Japanese beads by the hank usually costs about twice as much, therefore, they are not usually sold or purchased from Japan in this manner.

Most Japanese seed beads are repackaged for retail sale in manageable quantities based on price codes. More expensive beads (precious metals) may be sold in 2.5 or 5 gram units. Standard Japanese seed beads are usually sold in approximately 5 or 10 gram packages.

One major supplier, Miyuki, sells factory packages which contain up to 1 kg of beads, and are almost always repackaged into tubes or other containers for retail sale. To accommodate the average &quot;wholesale&quot; customer, whether it be a bead shop or designer, some larger distributors have made deals to receive their wholesale packages of beads in smaller (50 to 250 gram) pre-packaged sizes.

Toho, a major Japanese supplier, seems to have a more flexible packaging policy. Many of the tubed seed beads that can be found in craft stores are stamped with their name on the bottoms, indicating both a wholesale and retail packaging setup.

<doc id="704351" wikidata="Q6761569" url="?curid=704351" title="Maria Sanford">
<text>Maria Louise Sanford (December 19, 1836 – April 21, 1920) was an American educator. She was a professor of history at Swarthmore College from 1871 to 1880 and a professor of rhetoric and elocution at the University of Minnesota from 1880 to 1909.

==Early life and education==
Maria Sanford was born in Saybrook, Connecticut. Her love for education began early; at the age of 16 she was already teaching in county day schools. She graduated with honors from State Normal School (now Central Connecticut State University), using her dowry funds for tuition.

== Career ==
Sanford rose in the ranks of local and national educators, becoming principal and superintendent of schools in Chester County, Pennsylvania. She took the place of Anna Hallowell and served as professor of history at Swarthmore College from 1871 to 1880. She was one of the first women named to a college professorship. Dr. William Watts Folwell, President of the University of Minnesota at the time, invited Sanford to join the faculty. She did so enthusiastically. Dr. Folwell declared that hiring Sanford was one of his proudest achievements.

During her tenure at the university (1880–1909) Sanford was a professor of rhetoric and elocution, and she lectured on literature and art history. Sanford made strong connections with her students and challenged them with surprise tests and poetry recitations. She held student social events in her Como neighborhood home and gave speeches to organizations and groups across the nation. She was a champion of women&#x27;s rights, supported the education of blacks, pioneered the concept of adult education, and became a founder of parent-teacher organizations. Notably, however, she resisted universal suffrage until her late seventies.
Sanford was also a leader in the conservation and beautification program of her new state, including work with clubwoman Florence Elfelt Bramhall towards creating a forest preserve which became part of the Chippewa National Forest. U.S. Forest Service chief Gifford Pinchot later stated that &quot;without the farsighted and patriotic support of the Minnesota Federation of Women&#x27;s
Clubs, it would have been impossible&quot; to provide this wilderness conservation in Minnesota. Sanford retired from her University of Minnesota professorship in 1909. However, that did not stop Sanford from reaching out to the community and nation with the power of her speeches and public service. She traveled throughout the United States delivering more than 1000 patriotic speeches, the most famous being the powerful address &quot;An Apostrophe to the Flag&quot;, that she delivered at a national Daughters of the American Revolution convention. Sanford became head director for Northwestern Hospital, and created and served as president of the Minneapolis Improvement League. She served as the Minnesota governor&#x27;s representative to a national conference on child labor. Sanford publicized and urged public health improvement against trachoma infection blindness among children on Montana Native American reservations. Her address to a 1916 Minneapolis convocation honoring her was headlined as &quot;Trumpet of Social Reform is Sounded by Maria Sanford.&quot; She was also picked in 1920 to give a speech at the state celebration of the passing of the 19th amendment.
In 1910, the University of Minnesota constructed Sanford Hall in honor of Sanford. In 1964 they expanded the building by adding on a &quot;Tower&quot; to house more students. It was originally built to house the women of the campus. In the 1970s, the hall became coeducational, and housed 502 residents.

==Death and legacy==

Sanford died on April 21, 1920, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 83. In the following months, memorial gatherings were held in her honor at her home church Como Congregational and at her academic home the University of Minnesota. Her death was headlined in &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; and other newspapers. Sanford was called &quot;the best loved woman of the North Star State.&quot; 

Sanford is widely commemorated. She was the namesake of a World War II Liberty ship, the SS &quot;Maria Sanford&quot;, launched in 1943. A school in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was named Maria Sanford Junior High (now called Sanford Middle School) in memory of her. An elementary school in Montevideo, Minnesota, is similarly named Maria L. Sanford Elementary School. Additionally, an academic hall, Maria Sanford Hall, at Central Connecticut State University is named after her. In 1958, the state of Minnesota selected Sanford to represent the state, and donated a bronze statue of Sanford, created by Evelyn Raymond, to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection.

<text>William Lamb Picknell (October 23, 1853 – August 8, 1897) was an American painter of landscapes, coastal views, and figure genres, known for his rapid painting style. He was born in Hinesburg, Vermont and died in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

==Life and career==
Born in Hinesburg, Vermont, William was the son of Ellen Maria Upham and the Reverend William Lamb Picknell, a Baptist minister, both of New England families. William had a younger brother named George W. Picknell, who was born in 1864. In July 1868, the summer following his father&#x27;s death, the Picknell family moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts.

He began his career by working in a frame shop while living with relatives in Boston, where he took lessons from George Loring Brown. In 1872, he travelled to Europe where he trained with George Inness in Rome (alongside the master&#x27;s son and Douglas Volk) and Jean-Léon Gérôme in Paris (1874–75), and also received some informal training from Robert Wylie in Brittany. Inspired by the gardens and artist colonies at Pont-Aven and Concarneau, Picknell and friend Hugh Bolton Jones founded a similar botanical artist&#x27;s colony called &quot;Squam&quot; at Annisquam, Massachusetts on the leeward side of Cape Ann. The colony was thriving in the 1890s with Emil Carlsen and Robert Vonnoh in residence.

Throughout the 1880s, he lived primarily in Waltham, Massachusetts, but frequently travelled abroad, spending two winters in England and also visiting other parts of the US, including Florida and California. He married Gertrude Powers in 1889 and the couple had one child. He was living at Moret-sur-Loing, on the edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau, for most of the 1890s, but often spent the winters in the south of France. He returned to Massachusetts in 1897 following the death of his only child. He died of heart failure in Marblehead on August 8, 1897. 

A memorial exhibition of his life work was held the next year in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1900, Fifth Avenue Art Galleries sold 60 of his paintings for a total of $16,595, approx. $620,000 in 2024. In 2006, his &quot;Vue de Provence&quot; sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $45,000, and other works routinely sell for over $20,000.

<doc id="704359" wikidata="Q856103" url="?curid=704359" title="Contour integration">
<text>In the mathematical field of complex analysis, contour integration is a method of evaluating certain integrals along paths in the complex plane.

Contour integration is closely related to the calculus of residues, a method of complex analysis.

One use for contour integrals is the evaluation of integrals along the real line that are not readily found by using only real variable methods.

Contour integration methods include:
* direct integration of a complex-valued function along a curve in the complex plane;
* application of the Cauchy integral formula; and
* application of the residue theorem.
One method can be used, or a combination of these methods, or various limiting processes, for the purpose of finding these integrals or sums.

==Curves in the complex plane==
In complex analysis, a contour is a type of curve in the complex plane. In contour integration, contours provide a precise definition of the curves on which an integral may be suitably defined. A curve in the complex plane is defined as a continuous function from a closed interval of the real line to the complex plane: formula_1.

This definition of a curve coincides with the intuitive notion of a curve, but includes a parametrization by a continuous function from a closed interval. This more precise definition allows us to consider what properties a curve must have for it to be useful for integration. In the following subsections we narrow down the set of curves that we can integrate to include only those that can be built up out of a finite number of continuous curves that can be given a direction. Moreover, we will restrict the &quot;pieces&quot; from crossing over themselves, and we require that each piece have a finite (non-vanishing) continuous derivative. These requirements correspond to requiring that we consider only curves that can be traced, such as by a pen, in a sequence of even, steady strokes, which stop only to start a new piece of the curve, all without picking up the pen.

===Directed smooth curves===
Contours are often defined in terms of directed smooth curves. These provide a precise definition of a &quot;piece&quot; of a smooth curve, of which a contour is made.

A smooth curve is a curve formula_1 with a non-vanishing, continuous derivative such that each point is traversed only once ( is one-to-one), with the possible exception of a curve such that the endpoints match (formula_3). In the case where the endpoints match, the curve is called closed, and the function is required to be one-to-one everywhere else and the derivative must be continuous at the identified point (formula_4). A smooth curve that is not closed is often referred to as a smooth arc.

The parametrization of a curve provides a natural ordering of points on the curve: formula_5 comes before formula_6 if formula_7. This leads to the notion of a directed smooth curve. It is most useful to consider curves independent of the specific parametrization. This can be done by considering equivalence classes of smooth curves with the same direction. A directed smooth curve can then be defined as an ordered set of points in the complex plane that is the image of some smooth curve in their natural order (according to the parametrization). Note that not all orderings of the points are the natural ordering of a smooth curve. In fact, a given smooth curve has only two such orderings. Also, a single closed curve can have any point as its endpoint, while a smooth arc has only two choices for its endpoints.

===Contours===
Contours are the class of curves on which we define contour integration. A contour is a directed curve which is made up of a finite sequence of directed smooth curves whose endpoints are matched to give a single direction. This requires that the sequence of curves formula_8 be such that the terminal point of formula_9 coincides with the initial point of formula_10 for all formula_11 such that formula_12 . This includes all directed smooth curves. Also, a single point in the complex plane is considered a contour. The symbol formula_13 is often used to denote the piecing of curves together to form a new curve. Thus we could write a contour formula_14 that is made up of formula_15 curves as
formula_16

==Contour integrals==
The contour integral of a complex function formula_17 is a generalization of the integral for real-valued functions. For continuous functions in the complex plane, the contour integral can be defined in analogy to the line integral by first defining the integral along a directed smooth curve in terms of an integral over a real valued parameter. A more general definition can be given in terms of partitions of the contour in analogy with the partition of an interval and the Riemann integral. In both cases the integral over a contour is defined as the sum of the integrals over the directed smooth curves that make up the contour.

===For continuous functions===
To define the contour integral in this way one must first consider the integral, over a real variable, of a complex-valued function. Let formula_18 be a complex-valued function of a real variable, formula_19. The real and imaginary parts of formula_20 are often denoted as formula_21 and formula_22, respectively, so that
formula_23
Then the integral of the complex-valued function formula_20 over the interval formula_25 is given by 
formula_26

Now, to define the contour integral, let formula_17 be a continuous function on the directed smooth curve formula_28. Let formula_1 be any parametrization of formula_28 that is consistent with its order (direction). Then the integral along formula_28 is denoted
formula_32
and is given by
formula_33

This definition is well defined. That is, the result is independent of the parametrization chosen. In the case where the real integral on the right side does not exist the integral along formula_28 is said not to exist.

===As a generalization of the Riemann integral===
The generalization of the Riemann integral to functions of a complex variable is done in complete analogy to its definition for functions from the real numbers. The partition of a directed smooth curve formula_28 is defined as a finite, ordered set of points on formula_28. The integral over the curve is the limit of finite sums of function values, taken at the points on the partition, in the limit that the maximum distance between any two successive points on the partition (in the two-dimensional complex plane), also known as the mesh, goes to zero.

==Direct methods== 
Direct methods involve the calculation of the integral through methods similar to those in calculating line integrals in multivariate calculus. This means that we use the following method:
*parametrizing the contour
*: The contour is parametrized by a differentiable complex-valued function of real variables, or the contour is broken up into pieces and parametrized separately.
* substitution of the parametrization into the integrand
*: Substituting the parametrization into the integrand transforms the integral into an integral of one real variable.
* direct evaluation
*: The integral is evaluated in a method akin to a real-variable integral.

===Example===
A fundamental result in complex analysis is that the contour integral of is , where the path of the contour is taken to be the unit circle traversed counterclockwise (or any positively oriented Jordan curve about 0). In the case of the unit circle there is a direct method to evaluate the integral
formula_37

In evaluating this integral, use the unit circle as a contour, parametrized by , with , then and
formula_38

which is the value of the integral. This result only applies to the case in which z is raised to power of -1. If the power is not equal to -1, then the result will always be zero.

==Applications of integral theorems==
Applications of integral theorems are also often used to evaluate the contour integral along a contour, which means that the real-valued integral is calculated simultaneously along with calculating the contour integral.

Integral theorems such as the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem are generally used in the following method:
* a specific contour is chosen:
*: The contour is chosen so that the contour follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral, and also encloses singularities of the integrand so application of the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem is possible
* application of Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem
*: The integral is reduced to only an integration around a small circle about each pole.
* application of the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem
*: Application of these integral formulae gives us a value for the integral around the whole of the contour.
* division of the contour into a contour along the real part and imaginary part
*: The whole of the contour can be divided into the contour that follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral as chosen before (call it ), and the integral that crosses the complex plane (call it ). The integral over the whole of the contour is the sum of the integral over each of these contours.
* demonstration that the integral that crosses the complex plane plays no part in the sum
*: If the integral can be shown to be zero, or if the real-valued integral that is sought is improper, then if we demonstrate that the integral as described above tends to 0, the integral along will tend to the integral around the contour .
* conclusion
*: If we can show the above step, then we can directly calculate , the real-valued integral.

===Example 1===
Consider the integral
formula_39

To evaluate this integral, we look at the complex-valued function
formula_40

which has singularities at and . We choose a contour that will enclose the real-valued integral, here a semicircle with boundary diameter on the real line (going from, say, to ) will be convenient. Call this contour .

There are two ways of proceeding, using the Cauchy integral formula or by the method of residues:

====Using the Cauchy integral formula ====
Note that:
formula_41
thus
formula_42

Furthermore, observe that
formula_43

Since the only singularity in the contour is the one at , then we can write
formula_44

which puts the function in the form for direct application of the formula. Then, by using Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula,
formula_45

We take the first derivative, in the above steps, because the pole is a second-order pole. That is, is taken to the second power, so we employ the first derivative of . If it were taken to the third power, we would use the second derivative and divide by , etc. The case of to the first power corresponds to a zero order derivative—just itself.

We need to show that the integral over the arc of the semicircle tends to zero as , using the estimation lemma
formula_46

where is an upper bound on along the arc and the length of the arc. Now,
formula_47
So
formula_48

====Using the method of residues====
Consider the Laurent series of about , the only singularity we need to consider. We then have
formula_49

(See the sample Laurent calculation from Laurent series for the derivation of this series.)

It is clear by inspection that the residue is , so, by the residue theorem, we have
formula_50

Thus we get the same result as before.

====Contour note====
As an aside, a question can arise whether we do not take the semicircle to include the &quot;other&quot; singularity, enclosing . To have the integral along the real axis moving in the correct direction, the contour must travel clockwise, i.e., in a negative direction, reversing the sign of the integral overall.

This does not affect the use of the method of residues by series.

===Example 2 – Cauchy distribution===
The integral
formula_51

(which arises in probability theory as a scalar multiple of the characteristic function of the Cauchy distribution) resists the techniques of elementary calculus. We will evaluate it by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals along the contour that goes along the real line from to and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from to . Take to be greater than 1, so that the imaginary unit is enclosed within the curve. The contour integral is
formula_52

Since is an entire function (having no singularities at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator is zero. Since , that happens only where or . Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. The residue of at is
formula_53

According to the residue theorem, then, we have
formula_54

The contour may be split into a &quot;straight&quot; part and a curved arc, so that
formula_55
and thus
formula_56

According to Jordan&#x27;s lemma, if then
formula_57

Therefore, if then
formula_58

A similar argument with an arc that winds around rather than shows that if then
formula_59
and finally we have this:
formula_60

(If then the integral yields immediately to real-valued calculus methods and its value is .)

===Example 3 – trigonometric integrals===
Certain substitutions can be made to integrals involving trigonometric functions, so the integral is transformed into a rational function of a complex variable and then the above methods can be used in order to evaluate the integral.

As an example, consider
formula_61

We seek to make a substitution of . Now, recall
formula_62
and
formula_63

Taking to be the unit circle, we substitute to get:

formula_64

The singularities to be considered are at formula_65 Let be a small circle about formula_66 and be a small circle about formula_67 Then we arrive at the following:
formula_68

===Example 3a – trigonometric integrals, the general procedure===
The above method may be applied to all integrals of the type
formula_69

where and are polynomials, i.e. a rational function in trigonometric terms is being integrated. Note that the bounds of integration may as well be and −, as in the previous example, or any other pair of endpoints 2 apart.

The trick is to use the substitution where and hence
formula_70

This substitution maps the interval to the unit circle. Furthermore,
formula_71
and
formula_72
so that a rational function in results from the substitution, and the integral becomes
formula_73

Therefore:
formula_74

By using the residue theorem or the Cauchy integral formula (first employing the partial fractions method to derive a sum of two simple contour integrals) one obtains
formula_75

===Example 5 – the square of the logarithm===
This section treats a type of integral of which
formula_76
is an example.

To calculate this integral, one uses the function
formula_77
and the branch of the logarithm corresponding to .

We will calculate the integral of along the keyhole contour shown at right. As it turns out this integral is a multiple of the initial integral that we wish to calculate and by the Cauchy residue theorem we have

formula_78

Let be the radius of the large circle, and the radius of the small one. We will denote the upper line by , and the lower line by . As before we take the limit when and . The contributions from the two circles vanish. For example, one has the following upper bound with the lemma:
formula_79

In order to compute the contributions of and we set on and on , with :

formula_80

which gives
formula_81

===Example 6 – logarithms and the residue at infinity===
We seek to evaluate
formula_82

This requires a close study of
formula_83

We will construct so that it has a branch cut on , shown in red in the diagram. To do this, we choose two branches of the logarithm, setting
formula_84
and
formula_85

The cut of is therefore and the cut of is . It is easy to see that the cut of the product of the two, i.e. , is , because is actually continuous across . This is because when and we approach the cut from above, has the value
formula_86

When we approach from below, has the value
formula_87

But
formula_88

so that we have continuity across the cut. This is illustrated in the diagram, where the two black oriented circles are labelled with the corresponding value of the argument of the logarithm used in and .

We will use the contour shown in green in the diagram. To do this we must compute the value of along the line segments just above and just below the cut.

Let (in the limit, i.e. as the two green circles shrink to radius zero), where . Along the upper segment, we find that has the value
formula_89
and along the lower segment,
formula_90

It follows that the integral of along the upper segment is in the limit, and along the lower segment, .

If we can show that the integrals along the two green circles vanish in the limit, then we also have the value of , by the Cauchy residue theorem. Let the radius of the green circles be , where and , and apply the inequality. For the circle on the left, we find
formula_91

Similarly, for the circle on the right, we have
formula_92

Now using the Cauchy residue theorem, we have
formula_93
where the minus sign is due to the clockwise direction around the residues. Using the branch of the logarithm from before, clearly
formula_94

The pole is shown in blue in the diagram. The value simplifies to
formula_95

We use the following formula for the residue at infinity:
formula_96

Substituting, we find
formula_97
and
formula_98
where we have used the fact that for the second branch of the logarithm. Next we apply the binomial expansion, obtaining
formula_99

The conclusion is that
formula_100

Finally, it follows that the value of is
formula_101
which yields
formula_102

==Evaluation with residue theorem==
Using the residue theorem, we can evaluate closed contour integrals. The following are examples on evaluating contour integrals with the residue theorem.

Using the residue theorem, let us evaluate this contour integral.
formula_103

Recall that the residue theorem states
formula_104

where formula_105 is the residue of formula_106, and the formula_107 are the singularities of formula_106 lying inside the contour formula_109 (with none of them lying directly on formula_109).

formula_106 has only one pole, formula_112. From that, we determine that the residue of formula_106 to be formula_114
formula_115

Thus, using the residue theorem, we can determine:
formula_116

==Multivariable contour integrals==
To solve multivariable contour integrals (i.e. surface integrals, complex volume integrals, and higher order integrals), we must use the divergence theorem. For now, let formula_117 be interchangeable with formula_118. These will both serve as the divergence of the vector field denoted as formula_119. This theorem states:
formula_120

In addition, we also need to evaluate formula_121 where formula_122 is an alternate notation of formula_123. The divergence of any dimension can be described as
formula_124

===Example 1===
Let the vector field formula_125 and be bounded by the following
formula_126

The corresponding double contour integral would be set up as such:
We now evaluate formula_127. Meanwhile, set up the corresponding triple integral:
formula_128

===Example 2===
Let the vector field formula_129, and remark that there are 4 parameters in this case. Let this vector field be bounded by the following:
formula_130

To evaluate this, we must utilize the divergence theorem as stated before, and we must evaluate formula_127. Let formula_132

formula_133

Thus, we can evaluate a contour integral with formula_134. We can use the same method to evaluate contour integrals for any vector field with formula_135 as well.

== Integral representation ==

An integral representation of a function is an expression of the function involving a contour integral. Various integral representations are known for many special functions. Integral representations can be important for theoretical reasons, e.g. giving analytic continuation or functional equations, or sometimes for numerical evaluations.

For example, the original definition of the Riemann zeta function via a Dirichlet series,
formula_136

is valid only for . But
formula_137

where the integration is done over the Hankel contour , is valid for all complex s not equal to 1.

<doc id="704362" wikidata="Q2476024" url="?curid=704362" title="Christopher Love">
<text>Christopher Love (1618, Cardiff, Wales – 22 August 1651, London) was a Welsh Presbyterian preacher and activist during the English Civil War. In 1651, he was executed by the English government for plotting with the exiled Stuart court. The Puritan faction in England considered Love to be a martyr and hero.

==Life==
Love was born in 1618 in Cardiff. At age 14, Love became an adherent to the Puritan congregation. His father disapproved of Love&#x27;s interests in religion and sent him to London to become an apprentice. However, in 1636, Love&#x27;s mother and his religious mentor sent him to Oxford University instead. When William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced his Canons of 1640 to reform the English church, Love was one of the first Puritans to renounce them. As a young man, Love became the domestic chaplain to John Warner, the sheriff of London.

St Anne&#x27;s, Aldersgate invited Love to become a lecturer, but William Juxon, the bishop of London, refused to provide Love with an allowance for three years; Archbishop Laud had warned Juxon to keep an eye on Love. Declining Episcopal ordination, Love went to Scotland to seek ordination from the Presbytery there; However, the Scottish Church would only ordain residents of Scotland and Love planned to return to England.

On Love&#x27;s return to England around 1641, he was invited by the mayor and aldermen of Newcastle to preach there. In Newcastle, Love started attacking what he saw as errors in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in his sermons, resulting in his being sent to gaol. After filing a writ of Habeas Corpus, the Newcastle authorities sent Love to London. He was tried in the King&#x27;s Bench and acquitted of all charges.

Around the outbreak of the First English Civil War, Love preached as a lecturer at Tenterden, Kent, on the lawfulness of a defensive war. The authorities accused him of treason, but Love was again acquitted in court and was able to recover his court costs. Shortly afterward, Love was appointed as chaplain to Colonel John Venn&#x27;s regiment, and became preacher to the garrison of Windsor Castle.

On 23 January 1644, at Aldermanbury, London, Love received Presbyterian ordination from Thomas Horton. Love was one of the first preachers in England to receive this appointment. He then became the pastor of St Lawrence Jewry. According to William Maxwell Hetherington, Love was a superadded member of the Westminster Assembly. However, this assertion was questioned by Alexander Ferrier Mitchell, for lack of evidence and the more careful edition of the minutes of the Westminster Assembly by Chad van Dixhorn shows that Hetherington was in error and Love was not made a member of the Assembly.

On 31 January 1645, Love preached an inflammatory sermon in Uxbridge. This was the same day that the commissioners for the Treaty of Uxbridge arrived there. In his &quot;Vindication&quot; manuscript, Love claimed that his preaching there was accidental; however, the House of Commons voted to bring Love to London and confine him at the House during the negotiations. On 25 November 164, Love preached before the Commons; he did not receive the customary vote of thanks. His House sermon offended the Independents, who on gaining power in the House confined Love again. A House Committee for Plundered Ministers cited Love on two more occasions. Although Love was discharged, the English authorities watched his movements.

==Plot to restore Charles II==
In 1651, Love became involved in a plot to restore Charles II as the king of England.

In the plot, the Presbyterians sent Colonel Silius Titus to France to deliver letters to Henrietta Maria, the mother of Charles II; Colonel Ashworth brought the replies to Love&#x27;s house in London. On 18 December 1650, Love&#x27;s wife obtained an official pass to travel to Amsterdam. During this period, Love also received letters from Scottish Presbyterians who were sympathetic to Charles II. Love also hosted discussions in his home how to raise money for firearms from the English Presbyterians.

On 7 May 1651, Love and other prominent Presbyterians were arrested and confined in Liverpool. 
On 14 May 1651, Love was ordered to be arrested on charges of high treason and was confined to the Tower of London. In late June and 5 July, he was tried before the high court of justice. Love was defended by Matthew Hale; presiding at the trial was Richard Keble.

On 16 July, Love was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Robert Hammond wrote to Oliver Cromwell asking for leniency for Love. Love received first a one-month reprieve and then a one-week reprieve. On 16 August, Love wrote his final appeal for leniency to the English parliament. In this appeal, he admitted guilt to virtually all of his charges. However, the English courts wanted to make an example of Love to quash any further trouble from the Presbyterians.

==Death==
On 23 August 1651, Christopher Love was executed on Tower Hill in London. His execution was attended by Simeon Ashe and Edmund Calamy. On 25 August, Love was privately buried at St Lawrence Church. His funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Manton. Robert Wild wrote a poem &quot;The Tragedy of Mr. Christopher Love at Tower Hill&quot; (1651).

Love was married to Mary Stone, a ward of John Warner. The couple had five children, one of whom was born after Love&#x27;s death. Three of these children died as babies or small children and only two of their children, Christoper and Mary, lived to be adults. His widow married again to Edward Bradshaw (a twice mayor of Chester) two years after his death and they had six children. Mary died in 1663.

==Works==
After Love&#x27;s execution, leading Presbyterians of London (Edmund Calamy, Simeon Ashe, Jeremiah Whitaker, William Taylor, and Allan Geare) published Love&#x27;s sermons. The most important of his works are:

*&quot;Grace, the Truth and Growth, and different Degrees thereof&quot; (226 pp., London, 1652);
*&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Glory, Hell&#x27;s Terror&quot; (350 pp., 1653);
*&quot;Combate between the Flesh and the Spirit&quot; (292 pp., 1654);
*&quot;Treatise of Effectual Calling&quot; (218 pp.,1658);
*&quot;The Natural Man&#x27;s Case Stated&quot; (8vo, 280 pp., 1658);
*&quot;Select Works&quot; (8vo, Glasgow, 1806–07, 2 vols.).

&quot;Short and plaine Animadversions on some Passages in Mr. Dels&#x27; Sermon&quot; (1646) was a reply to William Dell. &quot;A modest and clear Vindication of the ... ministers of London from the scandalous aspersions of John Price&quot; (1649) (attributed to Love) replied to the &quot;Clerico-classicum&quot; of John Price.

<text>John Truman Carter III, M.D. is a fictional character from the NBC television series &quot;ER.&quot; He was portrayed by Noah Wyle and appeared as one of the series&#x27; principal characters from the pilot episode until the eleventh-season finale. Carter&#x27;s career path is one of the main story arcs of the series, beginning as a third-year medical student, becoming a resident, first in surgery and then in emergency medicine, before being promoted to an attending physician.

In the twelfth season, Wyle made guest appearances in four episodes, from &quot;Quintessence of Dust&quot; to &quot;There Are No Angels Here&quot;. During the fifteenth season, Wyle again reprised the role for five additional episodes, first returning in &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; and ending with the series finale. Carter is one of the few characters that appears in the pilot of the show and finale of the entire series.

==Character history==
Carter arrived at County General as a third-year medical student. His career got off to a rocky start when on his first day at County, he nearly vomited in the emergency room after seeing a critically wounded patient and had to be consoled by Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards).

Carter had a dedicated and compassionate approach with his patients. Initially interested in surgery, he switched to emergency medicine, much to his mentor Dr. Peter Benton&#x27;s (Eriq La Salle) initial dismay and disappointment. During his surgical residency, Carter laments on the lack of patient connection, specifically the lack of thorough follow-up and care.

In order for Carter to change from his surgical residency to an emergency medicine residency, he agreed to work without pay. He was part of an influential and wealthy family and did not need a salary, enabling County General to take him on despite the lack of funding for an additional position. As a resident, his confidence grew, and he often went out of his way to help patients.

===Season 6–8===
During season 6, Carter and medical student Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) are stabbed by patient Paul Sobricki (David Krumholtz), a law student suffering from schizophrenia. Knight dies from her injuries while Carter&#x27;s injuries leave him with lifelong kidney problems. As a result of Carter&#x27;s chronic battle with pain, survivor guilt, and resistance to getting help, he eventually develops an addiction to narcotics. He begins making mistakes at work. After Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney) catches him injecting left-over fentanyl from a trauma into his wrist, Carter&#x27;s colleagues hold an intervention and Dr. Greene demands that he go to an inpatient rehab center for medical doctors in Atlanta or be fired. Although Carter is initially opposed to going, Dr. Benton convinces him and boards the plane with him.

Upon returning from rehab in season 7, Carter makes peace with Chase, and apologizes for his long absence, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to admit to the fact that I was just like you.&quot; At the end of the season, Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) rejects Carter&#x27;s application for Chief Resident because of his history of addiction, stating that his spiral is too recent for him to take on the pressure of that hugely difficult position. However, early in Season 8 a combination of some reflection by Kerry and a gruesome error by Chen on a case that ended with a patient&#x27;s death leads her to change her mind and offer Carter the CR spot, which he accepts. Carter and the returned Dr. Susan Lewis have a brief and tepid romance that ends on cordial terms when they recognize they&#x27;re not in love (and Susan recognizes that Carter is romantically interested in Abby Lockhart). Carter has family struggles in Season 8, as his grandmother&#x27;s health declines, his weak father divorces his icy mother, and his mother arrives in Chicago to a hostile reception from her son. Later in the year, Carter recognizes that the death of Mark Greene means he has to be the ER&#x27;s leader, and he steps up with a strong and impressive showing when a possible smallpox case leads to the ER being quarantined.

===Season 9–10===
During season 9, Carter and Abby begin sleeping together after they are quarantined in the ER for two weeks during an outbreak of monkeypox. Meanwhile, the health of Carter&#x27;s grandmother, Millicent (Gamma), continued to decline, and his mother, Eleanor, had difficulty accepting her divorce from Carter&#x27;s father, Jack. Worse, Abby and Carter continued to disagree over whether or not Abby, a recovering alcoholic, should be drinking at all, even moderately. These personal issues come to a head when Abby&#x27;s bipolar brother Eric (Tom Everett Scott) reappears the day Gamma dies. Abby giving precedence to her duty as a sister marks the beginning of the end of Carter and Abby&#x27;s relationship.

Unable to shake his grief, Carter decides to join Dr. Luka Kovač (Goran Visnjic) in Congo without Abby&#x27;s support. While there, he mended his previous rift with Kovač (due to their feelings for Abby) and they began to understand one another better. When the clinic is overrun by militia, Luka is threatened by guerrilla soldiers. However, a young soldier recognized Carter as the doctor that tried desperately to save his brother though he ultimately failed. Out of respect for Carter&#x27;s actions, the guerrillas spare everyone at the clinic aside from an Army soldier they had been treating.

He returned two weeks later in season 10. When Kovač is reported killed in Africa, Carter goes back to retrieve his body, but finds that Kovač is alive but ill with malaria. He arranges for Kovač to be sent home, and sends a letter to Abby ending their relationship. Carter remains in Africa for several months and works in Makemba &quot;Kem&quot; Likasu&#x27;s (Thandiwe Newton) AIDS clinic. Carter and Kem develop a relationship, and when she gets pregnant with his child he asks her to accompany him to Chicago, where he introduces her to his colleagues.

Kem&#x27;s pregnancy ends tragically at eight months when she gives birth to a stillborn son in the episode &quot;Midnight&quot;. While they are both devastated, Kem and Carter&#x27;s relationship manages to survive.

===Season 11–12===
During season 11, Carter starts building an HIV/AIDS clinic adjacent to County General, with funding from his family&#x27;s charity foundation. It is named after his stillborn son – &quot;The Joshua Makalo Carter Center.&quot; Afterward, he goes to Paris, where Kem is visiting her mother. They reconnect and he offers to go to Africa with her so they can start afresh. She hesitates but later accepts the offer. Dr. Carter returns to Chicago and bids adieu to his friends and colleagues. In a fitting ending to his career at County, Carter&#x27;s last patient is a young girl whom he had delivered 11 years before when he had just been starting out.

In season 12, Carter appears in a four-episode arc, working with a fellow doctor in Darfur, Sudan, where he is joined by Dr. Greg Pratt (Mekhi Phifer) and Debbie (Mary McCormack). Pratt informs him that Luka and Abby have reunited and are expecting a baby.

===Season 15===
In the season 15 episode &quot;The Book of Abby&quot;, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. However, Carter&#x27;s is missing; according to Haleh, he did not want to do it because it was &quot;defacing government property.&quot;

Carter later returns in the season 15 episode &quot;The Beginning of the End”, in which he rejoins the ER at County General. He explains to Cate Banfield that he is relocating to Chicago, and is looking to pick up some shifts. She agrees after finding out that one of his teachers at the hospital was Mark Greene. He visits the Joshua Makalo Carter Center. At the end of the episode, it is shown that Carter is on dialysis because of amyloidosis developing from schistosomiasis, which irreparably damages Carter&#x27;s remaining kidney. He is back in Chicago to be placed on the transplant list. Working in the ER once again, he is shown still to be a good doctor with good judgment, but is still catching up with the latest medicines and techniques being used in the US. Eventually, his condition worsens, causing him to collapse while attending to a patient. While being treated by Dr. Gates and Dr. Archie Morris (Scott Grimes), he goes into V-tach, but is brought back thanks to Morris&#x27;s quick thinking. He is then transferred to Northwestern Medical Center.

In the episode &quot;Old Times&quot;, while a patient at Northwestern, he is visited by Benton, to whom he reveals that his marriage with Kem is going through a rough patch. In the same episode, Benton acts as a back-seat driver and supervises the operation to make sure Carter is well taken care of. Thanks to Benton&#x27;s thoroughness, which initially annoys the surgeon performing the operation, a complication is resolved and the operation is a success. Unbeknownst to Carter, the kidney is arranged for him thanks to the efforts of his old friends Carol Hathaway (Julianne Margulies) and Doug Ross (George Clooney), who are also unaware that they are helping Carter and only find out that &quot;some doctor&quot; got the kidney.

In &quot;And in the End&quot;, the series finale, Carter uses his family fortune to finally open the Joshua Carter Center, a medical clinic for the underprivileged that fits into the plans he announced when his grandmother&#x27;s will was being read. Kem surprises Carter by attending the opening ceremony, but she is seemingly uncomfortable around him. In a later conversation she tells him that she felt sad in Chicago because it reminded her of their son&#x27;s death. As she leaves the clinic&#x27;s opening, she tells Carter to call her to set up breakfast before she flies back to Paris. Carter indicates he might come back to County for good; however, this is potentially contradicted by his earlier idea that he would leave Chicago if it would save his marriage.

In the final scene, victims of an explosion come to County and while tending to a patient he invites Rachel Greene (Hallee Hirsh), Dr. Mark Greene&#x27;s daughter who is considering going to medical school, to help him, even calling her &quot;Dr. Greene&quot;.

==Related characters==
Early in the series, Carter&#x27;s plots typically stayed in the realm of the ER. In a symbolic gesture of this transference, he was told by Mark Greene &quot;you set the tone&quot; on Dr. Greene&#x27;s last day in the ER. Dr. Greene had been told the same thing, by Dr. Morgenstern, in the pilot episode in season 1 of the show. Dr. Carter, in turn, said the same thing to Dr. Archie Morris as Carter left the ER, although Morris did not understand the significance.

===Family===
Throughout the course of the series (particularly at the beginning of season 8) we meet various members of Carter&#x27;s wealthy family and see that he is very uncomfortable with coming from money, to the point where he goes out of his way to not talk about his background.

His father, John (Jack) Truman Carter Jr. (Michael Gross) is caring but reserved, and very acquiescent with his wife until he gets tired of her being an &quot;emotional vampire&quot; and divorces her. He and Carter have an awkward relationship; they love each other, but John does not respect his father. Jack recognizes this and keeps some distance from his son as a result. Carter&#x27;s mother, Eleanor (née Ferguson) (Mary McDonnell), is emotionally distant and cold. Her personality was largely shaped because she blamed herself for the death of Carter&#x27;s older brother, Bobby, from leukemia. Carter eventually figures out that much of her sadness comes from this and they briefly become closer, but eventually Eleanor cut ties with her family after Jack divorces her, to the point where John has no idea how to reach her and she refuses to return a phone call he makes after his grandmother (who never approved of Eleanor) passes away. It is noteworthy that neither of Carter&#x27;s parents is present when he dedicates the Joshua Carter Public Health building in the series finale.

Carter&#x27;s grandfather, John Truman Carter Sr. (George Plimpton), is disappointed by Carter&#x27;s career choice, and though Carter respects him, he also resents him. Carter&#x27;s grandmother, Millicent Carter (Frances Sternhagen), is a benefactor of the hospital, even funding Carol Hathaway&#x27;s clinic. Carter is very close to his grandmother, whom he calls &quot;Gamma&quot;, and intermittently lives at her home. They do occasionally argue, however, usually in regard to Carter&#x27;s reluctance to participate in matters related to the family foundation; Gamma modifies her will to remove Jack as the head of the foundation and puts John in charge of it, leading to him changing its mission from supporting Chicago arts programs to supporting public health initiatives.

Chase Carter (Jonathan Scarfe) is John&#x27;s first cousin and a &quot;functioning&quot; heroin addict. Carter, with the assistance of his colleague Anna, attempts to detox and rehabilitate him, but fails. Chase eventually overdoses, resulting in severe brain damage. Carter pleads for the family to keep Chase in physical therapy, and Chase improves significantly. Elaine Nichols Carter (Rebecca De Mornay), the ex-wife of another of Carter&#x27;s cousins, comes to the hospital for treatment for breast cancer and she and Carter have an affair.

===Romantic Relationships===
Carter had a number of unsuccessful relationships. Significant girlfriends are listed below:
*Liz (Liz Vassey), a patient who Carter dates during season 1. They have several sexual rendezvous until Carter realizes she has given him an STD. This ends their relationship.
*Harper Tracey (Christine Elise), a fellow med student, dates Carter during season 2. She cheats on Carter very early in the relationship with Dr. Doug Ross. Carter forgives her, only for her to dump him a few months later because Carter tricks another med student in order to get a procedure.
*Abby Keaton (Glenne Headly), a pediatric surgeon from Southside Hospital reassigned to County when Southside closes. Carter and Keaton begin working together eventually embarking on a clandestine relationship that ends when Keaton leaves for a volunteer mission to teach Pakistani surgeons.
* Carter develops a close friendship with Anna Del Amico (Maria Bello) during season 4, but his crush on her is never reciprocated. They kiss only once, when she bails Carter out of jail. She eventually returns to Philadelphia and makes up with her ex-boyfriend.
*Roxanne Please (Julie Bowen), an insurance saleswoman and patient of Carter&#x27;s, the two begin dating in season 5. The relationship falls apart for many reasons, including their busy work schedules, and because Carter falls for med student Lucy Knight. At one point Roxanne confronts Lucy about it, telling her that she thinks Carter&#x27;s feeling for her is ruining their relationship.
*Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) and Carter develop a liking for each other. Carter was jealous when Lucy started going out with Dr. Dale Edson (Matthew Glave). Carter and Lucy kiss only once as he decides to break things off owing to her being a medical student. They continued to be friends, until her death in Season 6.
*Elaine Nichols (Rebecca De Mornay) first appears when she comes to the ER from a fender bender. Elaine is Carter&#x27;s cousin Douglas&#x27; ex-wife. Their relationship to Elaine is just sex, though Carter wants more. She stops seeing Carter, when she finds out he knows that she has breast cancer. Carter tries to console her but she simply asks to be left alone. Later she moves to Europe for a few months and bluntly tells Carter to not call her when she returns.
*Rena Trujillo (Lourdes Benedicto) and Carter date off and on during season 7 until he finds out that she is still a student and is only 19. He tries to rekindle the romance but she dumps him because she knows he has feelings for Abby Lockhart.
*Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and Carter first met in 1994 when Susan was a second year resident. Carter had immediately developed a crush on her. After her breakup with another doctor, he had tried to console her with a kiss but she had stopped him. She had then moved to Phoenix, Arizona, returning in 2001. Once back at County the two rekindle their friendship and admit their feelings. They start dating but realize that the earlier spark is now gone, largely due to Carter&#x27;s feelings for Abby. They split amicably after Susan tells him to &quot;tell Abby.&quot;
*Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney), a nurse in the ER, and Carter become involved during season 9. After a series of personal crises, their relationship finally dissolves when Carter goes to the Congo for several months. When he returns, Abby kicks him out of her apartment and asks for her key back, ending their relationship. After returning to the Congo, he breaks up with Abby a letter, ruling out all chances of reconciliation. They remain friendly until the end of season 11 when Carter leaves County; by the time he returns in season 15, Abby has started her own family with Luka and they have relocated to Boston.
*Makemba &quot;Kem&quot; Likasu (Thandiwe Newton) begins dating Carter in season 10. A French/Congolese AIDS worker in the Congo, Carter meets Kem while working for Doctors Without Borders. They have a passionate, fast-paced romance culminating in Kem&#x27;s pregnancy. At eight months, she loses the baby and begins to shut down emotionally. Carter proposes, but she does not answer and moves back to Africa. During their separation, they date others, but when Carter visits her while she is in France, they reconcile, and give their relationship another chance. During season 11, we learn Kem and Carter have married but in season 12 Carter is by himself as he returns to Africa to provide medical aid in Darfur and makes ominous non-specific references to how things with Kem aren&#x27;t good. In the series finale, Kem returns to Chicago to visit the Joshua Carter Center, posthumously named after their son; she and Carter interact awkwardly, and it is implied that they might meet before she flies back to Paris the next day.
*Wendall Meade (Mädchen Amick), a social worker in the ER, with whom Carter has an affair while separated from Kem during season 11. She ends the relationship with him after he admits that he does not love her.

<doc id="704368" wikidata="Q4922281" url="?curid=704368" title="Black budget">
<text>A black budget or covert appropriation is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a state. The black budget is an account of expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified because of security reasons.

A black budget can be complicated to calculate, but in the United States it has been estimated to be over US$50 billion a year, taking up approximately 7 percent of the US$700 billion military budget.

== By country ==

===France===
In France, the black budget is known as &quot;special funds&quot; (French: &quot;fonds spéciaux&quot;). In 2020, €70 million was spent on the funds, which were also illegally used by ministers to pay themselves. There is no law that regulates use of the funds, though the black budget is voted on every year by deputies.

===Russia===
According to an estimate by the Moscow-based , about 21% (3.2 trillion rubles) of the Russian federal budget was &quot;black&quot; (not itemized) in 2015. This represents a doubling from 2010. The increase coincided with huge increases in the Russian military budget under Russian President Vladimir Putin.

===Spain===
In Spain, the black budget is known as &quot;reserved funds&quot; (Spanish: &quot;fondos reservados&quot;).

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey covert appropriations or &quot;discretionary funds&quot; () are allocated to the president, the government or state organs from a yearly state budget. Users of discretionary funds are offered guidelines as to how they may use these funds, but they have complete flexibility in their use. Discretionary funds can be used without approval from Parliament or any other state institution and are seen as tools to help the government achieve its goals without spending much time on bureaucratic work. Before 2015 the covert appropriations were only reserved to state organs and the government, but in March 2015, a regulation granting a discretionary fund for the presidency was passed as part of a government-sponsored omnibus bill in the Turkish Parliament.

The bill, and the discretionary funds in general have been heavily criticized and objected by opposition parties such as Republican People&#x27;s Party. At the time, it was claimed by opposition parties, that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was aiming to gain control of the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) with the fund, which was tied to the Prime Ministry back then. MİT was subordinated to the presidency in August 2017.

According to law, covert spending can not exceed 0.5% of total spending in the budget, but an additional 2% can be used as &quot;supplemental appropriations&quot;. In 2018 Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance estimated that the amount of presidential discretionary funds the President can use between 2019 and 2021 would be TL16.5 billion, 0.5% of total spending in the budget. In 2020 alone, the Presidency was granted TL14.1 billion covert appropriations.

===United States===
The United States Department of Defense has a black budget it uses to fund black projects—expenditures that it does not want to disclose publicly. The annual cost of the United States Department of Defense black budget was estimated at $30 billion in 2008, but was increased to an estimated $50 billion in 2009.
A black budget article by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, based on information given by Edward Snowden, detailed how the US allocated $52.8 billion in 2012 for the black budget.

The black budget has been known to hide multiple types of projects from elected officials. With secret code names and hidden figures, the details of the black budget are revealed only to certain people of Congress, if at all.

This budget was approved by the US National Security Act of 1947, which created the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Council and reorganized some military bases with help of the Defense Department.

The U.S. Government claims that the money given to this budget investigates advanced sciences and technologies for military uses. This kind of research is responsible for the creation of new aircraft, weapons, and satellites.

In 2018, some newspapers reported that the Trump administration requested $81.1 billion for the 2019 black budget. The request included $59.9 billion for the National Intelligence Program, covering non-military programs and activities, and $21.2 billion for the Military Intelligence Program which covers Intelligence activities by the Department of Defense. “In total, these two are more than 3.4% higher than the FY2018 request and the largest since then... [and it&#x27;s] the largest announced since the government began disclosing its intelligence budget request in 2007...&quot; according to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ Andrew Blake.

<doc id="704379" wikidata="Q6141072" url="?curid=704379" title="James Pavitt">
<text>James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946 – died December 22, 2022) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from June 23, 1999, until July 12, 2004, when he resigned a day after George Tenet. The CIA said the resignations was for personal reasons.

==Background==
Pavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, Missouri as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation, he was a National Defense Education Act fellow at Clark University (1969). He was a Principal of The Scowcroft Group, an international business advisory firm, and was formerly on the board of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO).

He was married with two children (from a previous marriage) and resided in McLean, Virginia.

His hobbies included collecting art, especially primitive American art.

==Intelligence career==
Pavitt served in the United States Army from 1969-1971 as an intelligence officer and was a legislative assistant with the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1973.

After joining the CIA, Pavitt was posted to Austria, Germany, Malaysia, and Luxembourg between 1976 and 1983. He was expelled (PNG&#x27;d) from East Germany. He was chief of station in Luxembourg (1983-1986). He served as a Branch Chief in the Africa Division. From 1990 to 1993, he served on the National Security Council team under Brent Scowcroft as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H. W. Bush. After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation&#x27;s &quot;Counterproliferation Division&quot; (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence&#x27;s Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD. In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004. In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.

After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly that which was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball.

In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission. The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance &#x27;unprecedented&#x27;. The commission&#x27;s report said that shortly after Bush&#x27;s election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.

When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might &quot;do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues.&quot; On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA said Pavitt&#x27;s decision was unconnected with Tenet&#x27;s departure. Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association. He resigned in July 12, 2004, one day after of Tenet&#x27;s resignation.

Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA&#x27;s Distinguished Intelligence Medal. He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.

===Post-CIA work===
He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC, to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom, and to The Scowcroft Group. He is a director of CACI International, Inc.

===Criticism and controversy===
Some former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing his four international postings over ten years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations. The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with &quot;excessive force&quot; but he took action to stop this behavior.

<text>Cool Devices is a series of animated hentai pornographic videos. Released as OVA, the series consists of eleven mainly unrelated episodes referred to as &quot;operations&quot; and is most noted for its very extreme sexual content, most of which center on BDSM and similar fetish themes as well as its high production values (compared to other hentai titles of the time).

==Episodes==
===Operation 01: Curious Fruit===
An innocent and virginal girl named Ai is lured by her curiosity into the underground world of sado-masochists by an exhibitionist couple who visits the club where she and her girlfriends are visiting. Spellbound, Ai follows the two, and is drawn into a world of bondage and rough sex. Finding herself transformed and liberated by the experience, Ai embraces the lifestyle, and enters into a passionate relationship with an equally uninhibited young man she is drawn to.

===Operation 02: Sacred Girl===
A reclusive young man and his younger sister live in a mansion together, where the young man frequently hosts sex parties every night, which he watches in his room via a network of surveillance cameras. It is later revealed that he wants to have sex with his sister, which he eventually does in a consensual scene near the end of the episode.

===Operation 03: Lover Doll/Winter Swimsuit/Enema===
====Lover Doll====
An anthropomorphic female rabbit is held in a cell as a sexual slave. Soon, a catgirl enters her room and has sex with the rabbit through the cell. Later, a man comes in and punishes the Catgirl for wandering off, then proceeds to rape her.

====Winter Swimsuit====
With a subtle BDSM premise, a teenage couple has sex in what seems to be a closed public bath house at night in the middle of winter. A reluctant girl is fondled, has her bathing suit cut off to expose her erogenous zones, and is coerced into performing various sex acts by her unnamed male partner.

====Enema====
An unnamed girl is coaxed into having sex in the women&#x27;s bathroom. The ensuing sex acts culminate in anal sex which cures her constipation.

===Operation 04: Kirei===
The episode begins when a young blue-haired woman is shown having sex with a group of strange men, afterwards they throw her into an oubliette where she then emerges as a butterfly. In what seems to be an island paradise, two well-endowed girls called Rui and Kirei are on vacation. As time progresses, they notice that there is something unusual with the natives and the beautiful butterflies that inhabit the island. As they begin to notice these oddities, they begin to have sex with each other and the natives. The episode ends with the girls being gang raped, then thrown down the same oubliette from the beginning of the episode, and emerging as butterflies.

===Operation 05: Seek I (Slave Girl Marino)===
Based on a visual novel, the story begins when an ordinary girl named Marino Okura (a virgin) is being chased by two young men who are revealed to be human traffickers. After getting captured, she is then shown in their car nervous and scared. When she attempts to escape, she is pulled back and brought into the estate of the dominatrix Saki and her unnamed master. Saki and her master spend the episode training Marino to be their sex slave, a process which involves Marino being forced to perform various sex acts and submit to the demands of her masters. As the episode progresses, it becomes apparent that Saki&#x27;s current master is actually the son of her original master, now deceased. Saki&#x27;s original master made a living as a world-famous bondage artist. This, however, was only his public face. His true face was that of a masochist female dominator. The episode culminates with Marino being left chained in a cell to await her next &quot;session&quot;.

===Operation 06: Seek II (SM Queen Saki)===
This episode is a continuation of Operation 05, and takes place during a sex party commemorating the anniversary of Saki&#x27;s master&#x27;s death. Saki presents the guests with a gift: Marino and two other girls (Momomi and Haruka), as their sex toys for the evening. Despite the introduction of new characters, this episode focuses mostly on Saki and her relationship with her previous master. Scenes of Saki reminiscing about her S&amp;M training as a child are interspersed with displays of Marino and the other girls being subjected to humiliation and torture at Saki&#x27;s hands. As Saki masturbates to thoughts of her deceased master, the three slaves enter the room, armed with bondage equipment, and take Saki back to the main party hall. Here, her current master presents Saki to the party guests for their enjoyment. Saki is subjected to much the same treatment to which she earlier exposed the other girls and is gang-raped; the episode ends with Saki being chained in a cell of her own.

===Operation 07: Yellow Star===
The plot centres around the addiction of a student called Ayana to a drug called &#x27;Yellow Star&#x27; and the sexual demands of every man she encounters.
Schoolgirl Ayana talks excitedly about her new stepfather - a famous detective and &#x27;hero&#x27; in local media. He is introduced to Ayana by her mother and is seen ogling her during lunch. The detective is mysterious and furtive though both Ayana and her mother seem oblivious to how dangerous he is. He has been investigating the distribution of an illegal drug, called &quot;Yellow Star&quot;, which is a mild hallucinogen, paralyzing agent, and extraordinary aphrodisiac. Ayana brags about how big her new father is to her boyfriend, Kohei, who asks how big his gun is. The detective is revealed to be corrupt, killing a competitor on a train by placing an explosive device near him. He latterly thanks two shadowy figures who provided him with both the explosive and a supply of &quot;yellow star&quot;.
He grows closer to Ayana and hatches various plans, spying on her intimately. It becomes apparent that the detective is buying a steady supply of the illegal drug as part of a long-term strategy to sexually abuse Ayana. Following a promise to Kohei that she will allow him to take her virginity after their exams are completed, the detective traps her in his basement, secretly drugs her with Yellow Star and proceeds to rape her. The ensuing days detail the escalation of the abuse as Ayana herself becomes addicted to both Yellow Star and her new stepfather&#x27;s increasingly violent sexual fantasies. Ayana&#x27;s abuse culminates in her father taking her to a strange location, where she questions his intention while still expecting to have sex. He admits that his colleagues have become jealous of his relationship with Ayana and have now demanded they be allowed to rape her for his continued access to the drug. Ayana is then introduced to the two well-endowed thugs who gang rape her with her stepfather as leader. Aroused by both the drug and their violence, Ayana responds to their perverse demands with a level of sexual dexterity hitherto unrealised by the youngster. As a powerful aphrodisiac, Yellow Star heightens Ayana&#x27;s own sexual appetite and the prolonged &#x27;rape&#x27; ends with all three ejaculating inside her. After the incident, Ayana realizes the abuse will continue with more rape and drug abuse. The Detective attempts to persuade her that she enjoys such encounters and that he has more to show her. She maintains it is purely her response to the drug and angrily breaks free from his grasp. She kills him on a rooftop using his gun and the explosive device saved from the train. She returns to a normal life with boyfriend Kohei. Days later, Ayana waits in a park for Kohei (who believes she has remained a virgin for him) but is abducted minutes before they can meet. Kohei searches in vain for his missing girlfriend but she is vanished. The two men who kidnapped her are revealed to be the original shadowy well-endowed distributors of &quot;yellow star&quot; and force her into another abusive encounter with them. In the final scene, Ayana is seen being forced by the two thugs to return to abusing Yellow Star, before being stripped and double-penetrated. It is implied that their endless supply of Yellow Star will equate to Ayana&#x27;s endless gang-rape and increasingly dominant sexuality resurfacing.

The character designer for this episode was Yasuomi Umetsu. It can be seen as a precursor to &quot;Kite&quot;.
In a scene cut from the original, the two Yellow Star manufacturers are shown to be demanding to engage in sexual activity with Ayana as their price for access to the drug.

===Operation 08: Slave Warrior Maya I===
The first of a two-episode story arc and based from manga series of the same name, this episode begins the story of , an average Japanese college student who is transported to an alternate dimension and inadvertently fulfills a prophecy. Maya is transported to another world, where she meets two lizard-like creatures who use trickery to convince her to take all of her clothes off where she is sold into slavery to Lord Estilgar, and used in experiments to turn her into a sex slave. She escapes and evades recapture by using a hidden power within herself to slaughter her opponents. This display of power gets the attention of two warring human and alien factions. Maya is recaptured, subjected to more sexual experiments, and is transformed into a hermaphrodite.

===Operation 09: Slave Warrior Maya II===
Continuing the story, Maya is transferred to a dominatrix who is given instructions to break her will and turn her into a sex slave. About this time, two members from one of the human factions are sent to investigate the power that was unleashed by Maya, citing a prophecy of a warrior long held in their culture. In captivity, Maya meets another slave, Leyna, who is not used for sex (until the end of the episode). They escape, but are quickly caught. Leyna is punished through sexual intercourse. Meanwhile, the dominatrix implants a parasitic alien mass into Maya&#x27;s uterus through her mechanically stretched vagina to lower her inhibitions and forces her to copulate with Leyna. As she is about to succumb to her sexual desires, Maya unleashes her hidden power and becomes the warrior prophesied.

===Operation 10: Binding===
Masaki Hoshino, a writer for a magazine publishing company is traveling on a train to go on a trip, while dreaming about having sex with a woman he has never met named Miyuki. When he wakes up, he finds that his belongings have been stolen and that he is stranded when a short earthquake has caused a landslide to block off the tracks. Masaki follows the same young girl who had stolen his things, which leads him to her mansion, where she lives with a group of other women. Masaki stays the night and soon realizes that he has stumbled into a S&amp;M situation. The oldest woman is the mistress of the house and the younger women are her slaves. This leads to his voyeuristic observation of various sexual acts, before actually engaging in sex with several of the residents. Eventually there&#x27;s another earthquake which destroys the house, though Masaki and one of the girls manage to escape. The episode ends with the two of them walking along the train tracks before a train roars towards them. Right before impact however, Masaki wakes up, still on the train with his sketch book in his lap and his belongings sitting next to him. He opens the book and sees a drawing of the girl who left with him.

===Operation 11: Fallen Angel Rina===
Pop idol Rina Yuki is renowned for her amazing stage shows and musical talent, which gets her noticed by a new production company, Angel Productions. At one of her concerts, she learns that her father has suffered a medical emergency, and has been hospitalized. Kurosaki, the manager of Angel Productions approaches her about switching to their company, and after learning her father owes the company a substantial amount of money and that the company is apparently part of a mob-related conglomerate, she agrees to sign on with them.

It turns out that AngelPro also works in the flesh peddling business, and under the guise of giving her a &quot;new image&quot;, they begin to train Rina through public humiliation scenarios and outfits. Among these humiliations she is molested on a public subway, taken to a sex shop pretending to be a porn actress, and masturbates in a porn cinema. Once her training has culminated, she&#x27;s auctioned off at a BDSM auction as a sex slave for 580 million yen (roughly US$5.9 million). Six months later she returns to her normal life and career as a singer. The manager and his assistant/slave are backstage, discussing how Rina turned out to be a good buy. In the backstage it is revealed her father had already died during her training.

At the end of her performance, Rina strips and begins masturbating with her microphone before finally losing her mind. The representatives from AngelPro walk off, and Rina&#x27;s manager collapses to the floor in disbelief. The final shot shows the all-male audience rushing towards the stage and crowding around her as she smiles vacantly, with a tear streaming down her cheek.

<doc id="704382" wikidata="Q6659302" url="?curid=704382" title="Living TV Group">
<text>Living TV Group was a British television consortium originally called Flextech before becoming a subsidiary of BSkyB, with Challenge still broadcasting.

Living TV Group had several owned channels, available in the United Kingdom on terrestrial, satellite and cable television platforms and in Ireland on satellite and cable television. Living TV Group&#x27;s advertising was handled by former sister company Interactive Digital Sales (IDS) until 1 January 2011, when Sky Media took over.

== History ==

=== Flextech (1990–2000) ===
Flextech began life as an oil services group, previously floated as an energy investment company back in 1983. After Roger Luard became chief executive in 1986, the company shifted focus into the media industry. Its first media acquisition was in 1990 with a 20% stake in programme producer/distributor HIT Communications; by October of that year, they had acquired a stake in The Children&#x27;s Channel, when it bought a 25% holding in Starstream Ltd. (TCC&#x27;s parent company) from BT. By 1992, Flextech was a media-only group, having built up stakes in local cable operators by way of selling off its non-core assets.

During the summer of 1993, Flextech entered into an agreement with International Family Entertainment (IFE), to launch a UK version of IFE&#x27;s flagship property, The Family Channel (Flextech holding a 39% stake in the venture). IFE had recently purchased much of the assets of the then-recently defunct TVS Entertainment, including most of TVS&#x27; library of shows (which would form large parts of the Family Channel&#x27;s schedule) and The Maidstone Studios, which became the main operational base for The Family Channel; this was a boon to Flextech, as the facility handled the channel&#x27;s uplink, playout and management operations. In the autumn, talks were held with the US-based cable/media company Tele-Communications Inc. Under the original terms of the proposed deal, Flextech would have acquired TCI&#x27;s European programming business (United Artists European Holdings, having been inherited by TCI via the purchase of United Artists Theaters&#x27; cable television business) in exchange for shares in TCI. By January 1994, the deal was complete, which allowed TCI to acquire 60.4% of Flextech, while Flextech acquired 100% of Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, 31% of UK Living, and 25% of The Children&#x27;s Channel, increasing Flextech&#x27;s control over that network.

The relationship between TCI and Flextech continued to grow; in February 1994, Flextech shareholders approved a deal in which Flextech absorbed the European programming interests of United Artists European Holdings. In return, UAEH&#x27;s US parent, TCI, acquired 60% of the enlarged Flextech. Within days of the deal, Flextech brought a 20% stake in HTV for £27million. Within a year, the stake was transferred to Scottish Television as part of its deal to acquire a 20% stake in STV. As part of the deal, Flextech agreed to license the rights to over 125hours of the drama and documentary output from STV&#x27;s library, as well as a production output agreement to commission television programmes from STV with a minimum total value of 6million pounds over three years.

In 1995, the company raised £92million after two new American companies invested in the company, US West (9%) and Hallmark (10%); the additional funds allowed Flextech to buy the remaining shares in The Children&#x27;s Channel, gaining full control of the network.

Talks were held with BSkyB in the spring of 1996 over a potential merger of the two companies&#x27; pay-TV channels, with the aimed of a wholesale consolidation of the subscription market, which would have saved costs and created a dominant supplier of programmes in the UK subscription market and Europe. The deal ultimately came to nothing, but two years later, both companies agreed to allow Flextech&#x27;s television channels to be broadcast on Sky&#x27;s new digital platform.

Elsewhere that year, it started discussions about increasing its stake in UK Gold to gain full control. At that point, Flextech held 27% with Cox (38%), BBC (20%) and Pearson (15%). By the autumn, Flextech had acquired Cox and Pearson&#x27;s stakes, giving Flextech an 80% stake in UK Gold.

Also during 1996, talks began between Flextech and the BBC about a partnership to launch a new range of entertainment channels featuring programmes from the BBC&#x27;s programme library. The deal was signed in March 1997 when the BBC and Flextech unveiled their new venture, which included &quot;BBC Showcase&quot;, an entertainment channel; &quot;BBC Horizon&quot;, documentaries; &quot;BBC Style&quot;, lifestyle; &quot;BBC Learning&quot;, for schools, and &quot;BBC Arena&quot;, for the arts, plus three other channels including &quot;BBC Sport&quot;, &quot;BBC Catch-Up&quot;, for repeats of popular programmes within days of their original transmission, and a TV version of BBC Radio 1. Initially, it was assumed that the new channels would be BBCbranded, but Flextech wanted the channels to carry advertisements. The BBC argued that BBC-branded services in the UK should not carry advertising and thought that this would undermine the rationale of the license fee in the UK. A compromise was reached when the BBC launched BBC Showcase and BBC Learning (later renamed BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge shortly before launch) on its own, with the remainder of the deal passing to BBC Worldwide.

Eventually, the concept of the BBC/Flextech channels led the launch of UKTV in November 1997, with BBC Horizon becoming UK Horizons, BBC Style becoming UK Style and BBC Arena becoming UK Arena. The concept of a television version of BBC Radio 1 was reused for the UK Play channel, which launched in October 1998; the dedicated BBC Sport channel never materialised. UK Gold was relaunched as part of the new branding, whilst UK Living remained a separate network, due to the similarities of some of its programming with that of UK Style; prior to UKTV&#x27;s launch, it was rebranded as Living to avoid confusion with the other UKTV channels. That year also saw The Family Channel relaunched in its current form as the game show-focused Challenge TV.

Flextech agreed to acquire Minotaur International for around $6.5million in 1999; Minotaur International was responsible for international sales of most programmes commissioned by Flextech. In 2007, Target Entertainment Group acquired Minotaur International and formed strategic alliances with Virgin Media Television to act as their preferred distribution partner.

In 1998, chief executive Roger Luard died, and Adam Singer became chief executive. In early December 1999, talks were convened about a merger between Telewest and Flextech, By 17 December 1999, the merger was agreed upon which created a £10.5bn media giant; Telewest shareholders owned 80% of the new group and Flextech shareholders owned 20%. The two companies fully merged on 19 April 2000.

=== Telewest/NTL/Virgin (2000–09) ===
Flextech continued to expand under Telewest ownership, with UKTV continuing to expand its network of channels with the BBC, plus a new venture which saw a shopping channel come into operation in Autumn 2000. In 2003, Flextech restructured its marketing department with creative solutions put together by central in-house marketers who worked agencies including Banc and Karmarama. The new marketing strategy was also used as a forerunner for the company&#x27;s newest channel, Ftn, which launched in January 2003 on the Freeview platform. This was followed by Living TV receiving a new on-screen look and an additional channelLiving 2, which specialised in reality and entertainment television. During the spring of 2004, United Business Media and RTL, which both held shares in Five, held talks with Flextech about merging the advertising sales teams of Five and Flextech&#x27;s channels together, but this deal ultimately did not proceed.

In 2005, Telewest, in preparation for its long-awaited merger with NTL, put Flextech up for sale as the companies agreed &quot;a content provider&quot; had no place within the merged operation. A lot of interest was generated by the sale; potential suitors included RTL, Hallmark Channel, ITV, Time Warner and Disney. However, it became clear the BBC had the right to veto any change in ownership of Flextech&#x27;s stake in the UKTV joint venture, which led to further speculation that Flextech&#x27;s assets may end up being split. NTL also complicated matters by stating it would be reluctant to see any of Flextech&#x27;s channels in the hands of terrestrial broadcasters such as ITV or Five; the underlying fear was that a terrestrial broadcaster could use Flextech to bolster the digital terrestrial platform and its appeal to viewers. Commercial terrestrial players had found that the popularity of Freeview worked to their advantage, as viewers have fewer channels to choose from than on pay-TV platforms.

By September, nearly all the bidders had pulled out except for BSkyB, but they later pulled out of the deal over a number of fears, including the Competition Commission investigating the sale. Media analysis at the time did not believe the sale was genuine, although five other bidders including RTL and ITV did state an interest. Simon Duffy, NTL&#x27;s chief executive, stated &quot;Flextech remains a key focus&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Flextech appointed Jonathan Webb to replace Lisa Opie as managing director; Jonathan Webb was responsible for moving Challenge away from its staple of game shows and axing Bravo&#x27;s &quot;laddism&quot; strategy.

In November 2006, NTL:Telewest began rebranding itself as Virgin Media. The group acquired Virgin Mobile in July, but went further by licensing the &quot;Virgin&quot; name, as they believed &quot;Virgin Media would shake up the market by bringing the Virgin traditions of value-for-money, brilliant customer service and innovation to the world of entertainment and communications&quot;. As part of the rebrand, Flextech was also renamed as Richard Branson was keen to move into branded content, and insisted that the Flextech business was retained as a condition of NTL buying Virgin Mobile and licensing the name. On 8February 2007, Flextech was renamed Virgin Media Television as part of a larger rebranding exercise covering the whole of NTL:Telewest, Virgin Mobile and Virgin.net.

== Sale to BSkyB ==
On 7 April 2009, Virgin Media formally began the sale of its content operation, issuing a sales memorandum for its Virgin Media Television unit and its ad sales division, IDS. It excluded its 50% stake in UKTV from the sale. Virgin Media sold its stake in UKTV, by then a portfolio of 10 pay-TV channels including Gold, Dave, Home, Watch, Yesterday and Good Food, in August 2011 to US-owned broadcaster Scripps Networks for £339million (about $504million). Scripps was negotiating a deal to give BBC Worldwide the option of increasing its stake to a maximum of 60%, by using a combination of cash and an unspecified &quot;package of digital rights&quot; for UKTV. &quot;The new agreement we are developing will bring benefits to UKTV&#x27;s audiences in the way they can consume content and will help to sustain UKTV&#x27;s track record of growth,&quot; said BBC Worldwide chief executive John Smith.

On 4 June 2010, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media announced that they had reached an agreement for the acquisition by Sky of Virgin Media Television. The companies had, in parallel, agreed to enter into a number of agreements providing for the carriage of certain Sky standard and high-definition (HD) channels. Sky acquired VMtv for a total consideration of up to £160million in cash, with £105million paid on completion and the remainder paid following the regulatory process. The acquisition expanded Sky&#x27;s portfolio of basic pay TV channels and eliminated the carriage fees it previously paid for distributing VMtv channels on its TV services. New carriage agreements secured wholesale distribution of Sky&#x27;s basic channel line-up, including Sky1 and Sky Arts, and the VMtv channels, on Virgin Media&#x27;s cable TV service. For an incremental wholesale fee, Virgin Media, for the first time, had the option of carrying any of Sky&#x27;s basic HD channels, Sky Sports HD 1 and Sky Sports HD 2, and all Sky Movies HD channels. Virgin Media made available through its on-demand TV service a range of content from Sky&#x27;s basic and premium channels, including the VMtv channels. Virgin Media also gained access to red button interactive sports coverage and the opportunity to deliver selected standard definition programming over the internet. Sky would assume responsibility for selling advertising for the newly acquired VMtv channels from January 2011. Completion of the agreements was conditional on obtaining merger control clearance in the Republic of Ireland.

Virgin1 was also a part of the deal, but was rebranded as Channel One on , as the Virgin name was not licensed to Sky. Virgin Media&#x27;s stake in UKTV was not included in the deal.

On 29 June 2010, the Competition Authority in Ireland cleared the proposed transaction. The parties proceeded after the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation did not direct the Authority to carry out a full investigation within 10 days of the date of the Authority&#x27;s decision.

On 13 July 2010, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media announced that Sky had completed the acquisition of Virgin Media Television (VMtv) following regulatory approval in the Republic of Ireland. VMtv was then renamed the Living TV Group. In completing the acquisition, Sky paid Virgin Media an initial £105million. Up to an additional £55million would be paid on UK regulatory clearance.

On 20 July 2010, the Office of Fair Trading announced that they would review BSkyB&#x27;s acquisition of the Virgin Media Television business to judge whether it posed any competition concerns in the UK. The OFT planned to investigate the deal to see whether it could constitute a qualifying merger under the Enterprise Act 2002. The watchdog invited interested parties from the industry to comment on the sale, including its potential impact on the pay-TV market. On 14 September 2010, the OFT decided not to refer BSkyB&#x27;s takeover of Virgin Media&#x27;s TV channels to the Competition Commission.

Following the sale, BSkyB chose to integrate the Living TV Group into its own operations. This resulted in the closure of Bravo, Bravo 2 and Challenge Jackpot on 1January 2011 and Channel One on 1 February 2011. On 1 February 2011, Living, Livingit and Living Loves were rebranded as Sky Living, Sky Livingit and Sky Living Loves, while Challenge was added to Freeview, with the channels receiving a 25% boost to their programming budget. Fifty-two of the Living TV Group&#x27;s 110 employees were made redundant as part of the process, including managing director Johnny Webb, Claudia Rosencrantz (director of television) and Daniela Neumann (director of programmes for Channel One, Bravo and Challenge). The integration process was completed at the end of January 2011. Living TV Group as a whole was dissolved as a company on 23 April 2014.

== Living TV Group channels ==
Living TV Group directly operated a number of linear television channels. Most of the channels were formed in the Flextech years. Additionally, Living TV Group operated a high-definition channel and a number of time-shifted channels. All channels were available on satellite and cable television services. Channel One, was also available on Freeview.

As Flextech, Living TV Group used to be interested in different markets from its current demographics which focus on an older age group. But, in an attempt to streamline the business that was at the time suffering from falling ratings across these channels, they were closed, and after the sale of Living TV Group to Sky, more channels were disposed of.

In 1996, a policy change saw the channel showing science fiction and horror and later became known for showing crime documentaries by day and adult programming at night. Over the later years, Bravo decreased the adult content shown and increased sportsmost notably Serie A Italian footballand imported shows such as &quot;Alias&quot; and sports coverage.

<doc id="704384" wikidata="Q1468723" url="?curid=704384" title="Nueces River">
<text>The Nueces River ( ; , ) is a river in the U.S. state of Texas, about long. It drains a region in central and southern Texas southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. It is the southernmost major river in Texas northeast of the Rio Grande. &quot;Nueces&quot; is Spanish for nuts, specifically pecans; early settlers named the river after the numerous pecan trees along its banks.

==Location and flow==
The Nueces rises northwest of San Antonio in the Edwards Plateau, in Real County, roughly 50 mi (80 km) north of Uvalde. It flows south through the Texas Hill Country, past Barksdale and Crystal City, approaching to within 35 mi (56 km) of the Rio Grande on the border with Mexico. East of Carrizo Springs, it turns to the east, flowing through the scrub plains of South Texas, across rural Dimmit, La Salle, and McMullen Counties. In central Live Oak County, it is joined from the northwest at Three Rivers by the Atascosa River and Frio River, then flows southeast along the coastal plain past Mathis where it is impounded to form the Lake Corpus Christi reservoir. It enters Corpus Christi Bay on the Gulf of Mexico at Corpus Christi.

==History==
Called Chotilapacquen by Coahuiltecan-speaking groups, the river was named &quot;Nueces&quot; by Alonso de León referring to the abundant pecan tree groves. One of the first settlers to scout the area was Cpt. Blas María de la Garza Falcón in 1766. From before the end of the Texas Revolution, Mexico recognized that the Nueces River was historically the border between its states of Coahuila y Tejas and Tamaulipas. However, the Republic of Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its border with Mexico, citing the Treaty of Velasco signed by Mexican President Santa Anna, who had agreed to the Rio Grande border within Texas after having lost the Battle of San Jacinto. This contention continued after the annexation of Texas by the United States, and was one of the causes of the Mexican–American War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the dispute, with Mexico—while under American occupation—recognizing the Rio Grande as its northern border.

Since the early 1800s, there have been rumors of lost Spanish mines in the vicinity of the Nueces River. These claims are based on the presence of two missions established in the region during the mid-1700s: San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz and Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria, the latter of which was located near the present-day ghost town of Montell.

On August 10, 1862, pro-Union Germans from the Texas Hill Country trying to flee to Mexico were ambushed and killed by Confederates—the Nueces massacre.

==Fishing==
The Nueces is one of several clear, warm-water spring creeks in the Hill Country of Texas. In its upper reaches, the water is clear and cool.

Unlike spring trout creeks in the Rocky Mountains, the Nueces holds largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and the native Guadalupe bass, along with a variety of panfish such as redbreast sunfish, rock bass, green sunfish, and Rio Grande perch. The American alligator also inhabits the Nueces River.

<doc id="704401" wikidata="Q3133106" url="?curid=704401" title="Henry Thornton (reformer)">
<text>Henry Thornton (10 March 1760 – 16 January 1815) was an English economist, banker, philanthropist and parliamentarian.

==Early life==
He was the son of John Thornton (1720–1790) of Clapham, London, who had been one of the early patrons of the evangelical movement in Britain. At the age of five, Henry attended the school of Mr Davis at Wandsworth Common, and later with Mr Roberts at Point Pleasant, Wandsworth. From 1778 he was employed in the counting house of his cousin Godfrey Thornton, two years later joining his father&#x27;s company, where he later became a partner.

==Career==
In 1784 Thornton joined the banking firm of Down and Free of London, later becoming a partner of the company which became known as Down, Thornton and Free. It was under his direction that this became one of the largest banking firms in London, with regional offices in other British cities.

In 1782 Henry Thornton had been urged to seek a seat in Parliament, and applied to contest one of the two seats for Hull. He soon withdrew on a point of principle, after learning that it was local custom to pay each voter two guineas in order to secure their vote. In September the same year Thornton was elected as member for Southwark, London. Despite lacking popular appeal, and refusing to bribe voters in a similar way to those of Hull, he became respected as a man of morals and integrity.

As an independent MP, Thornton sided with the Pittites, and in 1783 voted for peace with America. In general he tended to support William Pitt, Henry Addington and the Whig administration of William Grenville and Charles Fox. He seldom spoke in the House of Commons, as much of his contribution was in the various parliamentary committees on which he sat. In 1795 he became the treasurer of the committee responsible for the publication of the Cheap Repository Tracts.

He served on committees to examine the public debt (1798), the Irish exchange (1804), public expenditure (1807) and the bullion committee (1810), which scrutinized the high price of gold, foreign exchange, and the state of the British currency. The report of the committee, written by Thornton, argued for the resumption of gold payments in exchange for notes and deposits, which the Bank of England (of which his elder brother, Samuel Thornton, was a director) had suspended in 1797, but the recommendation was not well received at the time, and gold redemption on demand was not restored until 1821. In the next few years he continued to press for these measures to be implemented, publishing two reports in 1811.

This period 1797–1810 was a time of major change and great confusion in the British banking system, and the currency crisis of 1797 led to Thornton&#x27;s greatest contribution as an economist, for which he is most remembered today. In 1802 he wrote &quot;An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain&quot;, in which he set out to correct the view that the increase in paper credit was the principal cause of the economic ills of the day. This was a work of great importance, and gave a detailed account of the British monetary system as well as a detailed examination of the ways in which the Bank of England should act to counteract fluctuations in the value of the pound.

==Abolitionist and reformer==
Thornton was one of the founders of the Clapham Sect of evangelical reformers and a foremost campaigner for the abolition of the slave trade. A close friend and cousin of William Wilberforce, he is credited with being the financial brain behind their many campaigns for social reform and philanthropic causes which the group supported. For some years Thornton and Wilberforce shared a house called Battersea Rise which Thornton had bought in 1792. The cousins spent much time here co-coordinating their activities and entertaining their friends. After their marriages in 1796–97 they continued to live and work in close proximity for another decade.

In 1791 Thornton played a major part in the establishment of the Sierra Leone Company, which took over the failed attempt by Granville Sharp to create a colony for the settlement of freed slaves in Africa. The company sponsored the voyage to London (1791–93) of the Temne prince John Naimbanna.

As the company&#x27;s foremost director, Thornton virtually administered the colony as chairman of the company until responsibility was transferred to the Crown in 1808. It was at this time that he became a friend of Zachary Macaulay, who was governor of the colony 1794–99.

In 1802 Thornton was one of the founders of the &quot;Christian Observer&quot;, the Clapham Sect&#x27;s journal edited by Zachary Macaulay, to which he contributed many articles. He was also involved in supporting the spread of Christian missionary work, including the founding of the Society for Missions to Africa and the East (later the Church Missionary Society) in 1799, and the British and Foreign Bible Society (now the Bible Society) in 1804, of which he became the first treasurer. A friend of Hannah More, he assisted in the writing and publication of her Cheap Repository tracts. In 1806, Thornton served as Manager of the newly formed London Institution.

He was a pioneer of deaf education, setting up, with Rev John Townsend and Henry Cox Mason, rector of Bermondsey, Britain&#x27;s first free school for deaf pupils, the London Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. Its name and location changed over the centuries; The Royal School for Deaf Children Margate closed in 2015.

==Personal life==
In 1796 Thornton married Marianne Sykes (1765–1815), daughter of Joseph Sykes, a merchant from Hull. They had nine children. Both parents died in 1815 and the children were adopted by a family friend, Sir Robert Inglis. The eldest child, Marianne Thornton, was a bluestocking who lived in Clapham for most of her long life. She was the subject of a biography by her cousin, E.M. Forster (1879–1970), the novelist, who was one of Henry Thornton&#x27;s great-grandchildren. The eldest son, Henry Sykes Thornton (1800–1881), succeeded his father in the banking business, but the firm was merged into Williams Deacon&#x27;s Bank following the financial crisis of 1825–6. One of the younger daughters, Sophia Thornton, married John Leslie-Melville, 9th Earl of Leven). Another daughter, Isabella, in 1841 married the clergyman Benjamin Harrison who became a Canon of Canterbury and Archdeacon of Maidstone.

Henry Thornton was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Clapham where a commemorative plaque records the fact, with an additional reference to the family vault nearby. A selection of photographs is displayed on the website of the former school named after him.

==Legacy==
A successful merchant banker, as a monetary theorist Thornton has been described as the father of the modern central bank. An opponent of the real bills doctrine, he was a defender of the bullionist position and a significant figure in monetary theory, his process of monetary expansion anticipating Knut Wicksell&#x27;s theory of the Cumulative process. His work on 19th century monetary theory has won praise from present-day economists for his forward-thinking ideas, including Friedrich Hayek, who wrote an introduction to his &#x27;An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain&#x27;, and John Maynard Keynes alike.

<text>Natasha Tonya Henstridge (born August 15, 1974) is a Canadian actress. In 1995, she rose to prominence with her debut role in the science-fiction horror film &quot;Species&quot;, followed by performances in &quot;Species II&quot; and &quot;Species III&quot;. She has since starred in a string of films and television series, including &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; (1996), &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (2000), &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; (2004), &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; (2001), &quot;She Spies&quot; (2002–2004), &quot;Eli Stone&quot; (2008–2009), and &quot;Would Be Kings&quot; (2008). For the latter, she won the Gemini Award for Best Actress. From 2019 until 2022, she starred in the CBC Television series &quot;Diggstown&quot;.

==Early life==
Henstridge was born in Springdale, Newfoundland and Labrador, on August 15, 1974, to Helen Henstridge, a homemaker, and Brian Henstridge, a construction manager and business owner. She was raised in Fort McMurray, Alberta, with her younger brother, Shane.

At age 14, Henstridge entered the Casablanca Modeling Agency&#x27;s Look of the Year contest and was chosen first runner-up. The following year, she went to Paris to pursue her modeling ambitions. At age 15, she was featured on her first magazine cover, the French edition of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. Several more magazine-covers followed and Henstridge went on to do television commercials for products such as Olay, Old Spice, and Lady Stetson. With her modeling career established, Henstridge started doing commercials and decided she preferred acting. One of her first roles was as Foxy Fox in the Missoula Children&#x27;s Theater production of &quot;Snow White and the seven Dwarfs&quot; staged in Fort McMurray.

==Career==

===Film===
In her film debut &quot;Species&quot; (1995), Henstridge played Sil, a genetically engineered alien/human hybrid created from a message received by SETI, who breaks free from the captivity of a laboratory. Pursued by a team of experts who band together to stop her, she embarks on a killing spree while also discovering her powerful instinct to mate, which would result in her offspring being a threat to mankind. &quot;Species&quot; was an instant hit, making US$113 million at the box office. Notable for its sexual content, the film won Henstridge the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss for a scene in which her character, while kissing an abusive date, impales his head with her tongue. In 1998, she played Eve, a more ambiguous genetic duplicate of Sil, in &quot;Species II&quot;, which was a failure at the box office. Between &quot;Species&quot; films, Henstridge starred in two low-budget action films in 1996, &quot;&quot; with Christopher Lambert and &quot;Maximum Risk&quot; opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme.

A few smaller independent movies followed, including &quot;Bela Donna&quot; and &quot;Dog Park&quot;, with varied box-office returns. Henstridge starred in the film &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; (2000) and its sequel &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot; (2004). Despite having some reservations about the science-fiction genre, she signed up for John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; (2001) in the lead role of Lieutenant Melanie Ballard. The film was not well received, with a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2004, she briefly appeared as Eve in &quot;Species III&quot;.

In 2007, Henstridge was a festival judge at the first annual Noor Iranian Film Festival.

===Television===
Henstridge has played a number of roles on television, for example in &quot;Caracara&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. From 2005 to 2006, she had a recurring role as the speaker&#x27;s chief of staff on the ABC drama &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, which starred Geena Davis as a fictional female U.S. president. She also hosted &quot;Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed&quot; on TLC, a show about urban legends. She guest-starred as a substitute teacher in the first-season &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Tom&#x27;s Rhinoplasty&quot;, and was credited as &quot;the chick from &quot;Species&quot;&quot;.

Henstridge was working on the television series &quot;She Spies&quot;, prior to its cancellation. She has also completed a television movie for the Lifetime channel titled &quot;Widow on the Hill&quot;. In 2006, she filmed the CTV original miniseries &quot;Would Be Kings&quot; in Hamilton, Ontario, for which she won a Gemini Award. She also starred in the expansion set to the video game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;, entitled &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot;.

In 2008, Henstridge played a role on the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;Eli Stone&quot;. She has also been involved with two other productions, joining the cast of Dave Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Anytown&quot;, an indie drama that examines a racist high-school attack and its aftermath. She has also been involved with the production of &quot;Should&#x27;ve Been Romeo&quot; from American Independent Pictures.

In 2009, Henstridge did a guest spot on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Conan O&#x27;Brien. During this, she demonstrated a Newfoundland custom called &quot;screeching in&quot;, which involved getting O&#x27;Brien to drink Newfoundland Screech rum and kiss a large fish.

In 2011, she appeared on the season-9 finale and season-10 premiere of &quot;&quot; as Renee Locklear. She then starred in the CW television series &quot;The Secret Circle&quot; as Dawn Chamberlain.

From 2019 to 2022, she starred in the CBC Television/BET+ drama series &quot;Diggstown&quot;.

==Personal life==
Henstridge married American actor Damian Chapa in 1995; they divorced in 1996.

She dated American actor Liam Waite from 1996 to 2004; they have two sons together.

She began a relationship with Scottish singer Darius Campbell in 2004. They became engaged, but broke it off in early 2010, then married on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011. They filed for divorce in July 2013. The divorce was finalized in February 2018.

In June 2009, Henstridge spoke of her past use of diet pills in combination with extreme diets for weight loss; she said this damaged her metabolism and led to subsequent weight gain.

In November 2017, during the height of the #MeToo movement, Henstridge joined six other actresses in accusing director Brett Ratner of sexual assault and harassment; she maintains that he forced her to perform oral sex on him in the early 1990s. She also accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment.

<text>Max Liebermann (20 July 1847 – 8 February 1935) was a German painter and printmaker, and one of the leading proponents of Impressionism in Germany and continental Europe. In addition to his activity as an artist, he also assembled an important collection of French Impressionist works.

The son of a Jewish banker, Liebermann studied art in Weimar, Paris, and the Netherlands. After living and working for some time in Munich, he returned to Berlin in 1884, where he remained for the rest of his life. He later chose scenes of the bourgeoisie, as well as aspects of his garden near Lake Wannsee, as motifs for his paintings. Noted for his portraits, he did more than 200 commissioned ones over the years, including of Albert Einstein and Paul von Hindenburg.

Liebermann was honored on his 50th birthday with a solo exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, and the following year he was elected to the academy. From 1899 to 1911 he led the premier avant-garde formation in Germany, the Berlin Secession. Beginning in 1920 he was president of the Prussian Academy of Arts. On his 80th birthday, in 1927, Liebermann was celebrated with a large exhibition, declared an honorary citizen of Berlin and hailed in a cover story in Berlin&#x27;s leading illustrated magazine. But such public accolades were short-lived. In 1933 he resigned when the academy decided to no longer exhibit works by Jewish artists, before he would have been forced to do so under laws restricting the rights of Jews. His art collection, which his wife inherited after his death, was looted by the Nazis after her death in 1943.

In his various capacities as a leader in the artistic community, Liebermann spoke out often for the separation of art and politics. In the words of arts reporter and critic, Grace Glueck, he &quot;pushed for the right of artists to do their own thing, unconcerned with politics or ideology.&quot; His interest in French Realism was offputting to conservatives, for whom such openness suggested what they thought of as Jewish cosmopolitanism.

==Biography==
===Youth===

Max Liebermann was a son of a wealthy Jewish fabric manufacturer turned banker, Louis Liebermann, and his wife Philippine (née Haller). His grandfather , a textile entrepreneur who founded Liebermann&#x27;s significant fortune, was also the grandfather of Emil Rathenau, Carl Liebermann and Willy Liebermann von Wahlendorf. Only three days after Max&#x27;s birth, the came into force, which granted the Jews in Prussia greater rights. He had five siblings, including the older brother , who later became an entrepreneur, and the younger brother, the historian Felix Liebermann.

In 1851 the Liebermanns moved to Behrenstraße, from where Max attended a nearby humanistic toddler school. Soon he hated this, as he did every later educational institution.

After primary school, Liebermann switched to the Dorotheenstädtische Realschule. He passed the time more and more by drawing, which his parents cautiously encouraged. When Max was ten years old, his father Louis bought the imposing Palais Liebermann, at Pariser Platz 7, directly to the north of the Brandenburg Gate. The family attended church services in the reform community and increasingly turned away from the more orthodox way of life of their grandfather. Although the Liebermanns&#x27; house had large salons and numerous bedrooms, the parents encouraged their three sons to sleep in a common room. This was also provided with a glass window in the wall so that the schoolwork could be supervised from outside.

When Louis Liebermann commissioned his wife to paint an oil painting in 1859, Max Liebermann accompanied his mother to the painter . Out of boredom, he asked for a pen and began to draw. Even as an old woman, Antonie Volkmar was proud to have discovered Liebermann. His parents were not enthusiastic about painting, but at least in this case their son did not refuse to attend schools. On his afternoons off school, Max received private painting lessons from Eduard Holbein and Carl Steffeck.

In the family, Max was not considered particularly intelligent. At school, his mind often wandered, and he gave inappropriate answers to questions his teachers asked him. This resulted in teasing from classmates which became unbearable for him, so that he took refuge several times in supposed illnesses. His parents showed him affection and support, but he was aware of their greater regard for his older, more &quot;sensible&quot; brother Georg. Max&#x27;s talent for drawing did not mean much to his parents: When his works were first published, the father forbade the 13-year-old from signing the name Liebermann on them.

As a secondary school, Louis Liebermann chose the Friedrichwerdersche Gymnasium for his sons, where the sons of Bismarck had studied. In 1862, 15-year-old Max attended an event by the young socialist Ferdinand Lassalle, whose passionate ideas fascinated the millionaire&#x27;s son. In 1866 Max Liebermann graduated from high school. He later claimed to have been a bad student and had difficulty with getting through the exams: in truth, he was not one of the better students in mathematics, but his participation in the higher grades was considered &quot;decent and well-mannered&quot;. In the Abitur exams he came fourth in his class, but in his family Max always felt like a &quot;bad student&quot;.

===Student life and early works===
After graduating from high school, Liebermann enrolled at the Friedrich Wilhelm University. He chose chemistry, in which his cousin Carl Liebermann had also been successful. The chemistry course served as a pretext to be able to devote himself to art. Instead of attending the lectures, he rode out in the zoo and painted. At Carl Steffeck, he was also and allowed to perform assistant tasks more and more frequently in the design of monumental battle pictures. There he met Wilhelm Bode, who later became Liebermann&#x27;s sponsor and director of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. He studied law and philosophy at the University of Berlin, which exmatriculated Liebermann on 22 January 1868 because of &quot;study failure&quot;. After an intense conflict with his father, who was not impressed by his son&#x27;s path, In 1869 his parents made it possible for him to study painting and drawing at the Grand Ducal Saxon Art School in Weimar. There he became a student of the Belgian history painter Ferdinand Pauwels, who fostered in him an appreciation of the work of Rembrandt during a visit to the class at the Fridericianum in Kassel. Rembrandt had a lasting influence on the style of the young Liebermann.

In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 he was briefly gripped by the general patriotic frenzy. He volunteered for the Johannitern because a badly healed broken arm prevented him from regular military service, and served as a medic during the siege of Metz. In 1870/1871 a total of 12,000 Jews went to war on the German side. The experiences on the battlefields shocked the young artist, whose enthusiasm for war waned.

From Whitsun 1871, Liebermann stayed in Düsseldorf, where the influence of French art was stronger than in Berlin. There he met Mihály von Munkácsy, whose realistic depiction of women plucking wool, a simple everyday scene, aroused Liebermann&#x27;s interest. Financed by his brother Georg, he traveled to the Netherlands, Amsterdam and Scheveningen for the first time, where he was inspired by the light, the people and the landscape.

His first large painting, &quot;Die Gänserupferinnen&quot; (&quot;Goose Pluckers&quot;), was made in the months after his return. Painted in dark tones, it shows the prosaic activity of goose plucking. In addition to Munkászy&#x27;s naturalism, Liebermann also incorporated elements of history painting into it. At the sight of the still unfinished painting his teacher Pauwels dismissed him: he could not teach him anything more. When Liebermann took part in the Hamburg art exhibition with the picture in 1872, his unusual subject aroused disgust and shock. Although the critics praised his skillful painting style, he was criticized as a &quot;painter of the ugly&quot;. When the painting was exhibited in Berlin that same year, it met with similar opinions, but a buyer was found in the railway magnate Bethel Henry Strousberg. Liebermann had found his first style: realistic and unsentimental depiction of working people, without condescending pity or romanticism.

In 1873 Liebermann saw farmers harvesting beets at the gates of Weimar. He decided to capture this motif in oil, but when Karl Gussow cynically advised him not to paint the picture, Liebermann scratched it from the canvas. He felt powerless and without drive. Liebermann decided to visit the famous history and salon painter Hans Makart in Vienna, where he stayed for only two days. Instead, he was determined to turn his back on Germany and its art scene, which Liebermann regarded at the time as backward and outdated.

===Paris, Barbizon and Amsterdam===
In December 1873 Liebermann moved to Paris and set up a studio in Montmartre. In the world capital of art, he wanted to make contacts with leading realists and impressionists. But the French painters refused to have any contact with the German Liebermann. In 1874 he submitted his goose plucking to the Salon de Paris, where the picture was accepted but received negative reviews in the press, especially from a nationalist point of view. Liebermann first spent the summer of 1874 in Barbizon, near the Forest of Fontainebleau. &quot;Munkácsy attracted me a lot, but Troyon, Daubigny, Corot and above all Millet did even more.&quot;

The landscape painting &quot;en plein air&quot; practiced by painters of the Barbizon School was of great importance for the development of Impressionism. Liebermann turned away from the old-fashioned, heavy painting of Munkácsy, more interested in the methods of the Barbizon School than in the motives that influenced them: In Barbizon, for example, he remembered the Weimar study &quot;Arbeiter im Rübenfeld&quot;, looked for a similar motif and created the &quot;Potato Harvest in Barbizon&quot;, which he did not complete until years later. Ultimately, he tried to follow in Millet&#x27;s footsteps and, in the opinion of contemporary critics, lagged behind him with his own achievements: The depiction of the workers in their environment seemed unnatural; it seemed as if they were added to the landscape at a later date.

In 1875 Liebermann spent three months in Zandvoort in Holland. In Haarlem he developed a brighter and more spontaneous style by copying paintings by Frans Hals. It became Liebermann&#x27;s habit to allow much time to pass between the idea and the execution of larger paintings. It was only when he returned to Paris in the autumn of 1875 and moved into a larger studio that he took up what he had seen and created his first painting of bathing fishermen&#x27;s boys, a subject he would revisit years later.

In the summer of 1876 there was another stay of several months in the Netherlands, where he continued his studies. In Amsterdam he met the etcher William Unger, who brought him into contact with Jozef Israëls and the Hague School. In his picture, &quot;Dutch Sewing School&quot;, Liebermann already uses the effect of light in an impressionistic way. He got to know the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam through Professor August Allebé, which led him to a painterly analysis of his Jewish origins. The first studies of the Amsterdam orphanage were also made.

Under the pressure of being accountable to his parents and himself, Liebermann fell into deep depression in Paris, and was often close to despair. During this time only a few pictures were made, and his participation in the Paris Salon did not bring him the desired success. The art scene in the metropolis could not give Liebermann anything; it had even rejected him as an artist on chauvinistic reasons. His paintings had not become &quot;French&quot;. In contrast, his regular stays in Holland were more influential. Liebermann made the final decision to leave Paris.

===Munich===
In 1878 Liebermann went on a trip to Italy for the first time. In Venice he wanted to look at works by Vittore Carpaccio and Gentile Bellini in order to find new orientation. There he met a group of Munich painters – among them Franz von Lenbach – with whom he stayed in Venice for three months and finally followed them to the Bavarian capital, which with the Munich School was also the German center of naturalistic art.

In December 1878 Liebermann began work on &quot;The 12-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple With the Scholars&quot;. He had already made the first sketches for this work in the synagogues of Amsterdam and Venice. Never before had he staged a picture with such care: he combined the studies of the synagogue interiors with individual figures, of which he previously made nude studies, in order to then bring them together dressed. He immersed the subject in an almost mystical light, which seems to emanate from the baby Jesus as the shining center.

His painting of a Semitic-looking boy Jesus conferring with Jewish scholars sparked a wave of indignation. At the International Art Show in Munich it was denounced for its supposed blasphemy, with a critic in the &quot;Augsburger Allgemeine&quot; describing Jesus as &quot;the ugliest, most impertinent Jewish boy imaginable.&quot; 
While the later Prince Regent Luitpold sided with Liebermann, the conservative MP and priest Balthasar von Daller denied him as a Jew the right to represent Jesus in this way. The painting was &quot;removed from its central position of honor on the opening day of the Munich Exhibition on the orders of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria. In Berlin, the court preacher Adolf Stoecker continued the antisemitic debate about the painting. A few important artist colleagues took his side, including Wilhelm Leibl. In response to the criticism, Liebermann painted over the picture by redesigning the young Jesus. A photograph of the original shows a child clad in a shorter cloak and with sidelocks and head slightly pushed forward and without sandals; the overpainted picture shows Jesus in an upright posture with longer hair and a longer robe and sandals. Although the original version had been reproduced in Richard Muther&#x27;s overview publication for decades the overpainting was not discovered until 1993. The discovery of the overpainting initiated an intensive discussion about the reasons for Liebermann&#x27;s choice of a historical subject (coined since centuries by the Christian iconography) in view of the growing antisemitism, as well as Liebermann&#x27;s own relationship to Judaism.
From that time on, Liebermann was a famous artist, but his painterly advances came to a standstill during his stay in Holland in 1879: The light in a view of a rural village street that was created at that time appears pale and unnatural. In 1880 he took part in the Paris Salon. The pictures that were shown there had one thing in common: the representation of people working peacefully side by side in a harmonious community. Liebermann did not find the mood shown in the surroundings of Munich, which was heated up by antisemitic hostility, but tried to absorb it in his annual stays in the Netherlands. In 1879 he also traveled to the Dachauer Moos, Rosenheim and the Inn Valley for painting stays, where his painting &quot;Brannenburger Biergarten&quot; was created.

===Netherlands===

In the summer of 1880, Liebermann traveled to the Brabant village of Dongen. There studies emerged that he later used for his painting &quot;Schusterwerkstatt&quot;. After completing this work, he traveled once more to Amsterdam before returning to Munich. Something happened there that &quot;decided his artistic career&quot;. He glanced into the garden of the Catholic old man&#x27;s house, where elderly men in black were sitting on benches in the sunlight. About this moment, Liebermann later said: &quot;It was as if someone were walking on a level path and suddenly stepped on a spiral spring that sprang up&quot;. He began to paint the motif, and for the first time used the effect of the light filtered through a canopy (or other barriers), the later so-called &quot;Liebermann&#x27;s sunspots&quot;, that is, the selective representation of (partially) self-colored light to create an atmospheric atmosphere. This prefigured Liebermann&#x27;s late Impressionist work, which has been compared to the work of Renoir.

At the Paris Salon in 1880 &quot;he was the first German to receive an honorable mention for this work&quot;. In addition, Léon Maître, an important Impressionist collector, acquired several paintings by Liebermann. Encouraged by the longed-for success, he turned to an earlier topic: Using older studies, he composed &quot;Recreation Time in the Amsterdam Orphanage&quot; (1881–82), also with &quot;sunspots&quot;.

In the fall, Liebermann traveled again to Dongen to complete the &quot;Shoemaker&#x27;s Workshop&quot; there. In this work, too, his clear turn to light painting is manifested, but at the same time he remained true to his earlier work depictions by continuing to dispense with transfigurative, romantic elements. The &quot;Shoemaker&#x27;s Workshop&quot; and &quot;Recreation Time in the Amsterdam Orphanage&quot; found a buyer in Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Paris Salon in 1882. The French press celebrated him as an impressionist. The collector Ernest Hoschedé wrote enthusiastically to Édouard Manet: &quot;If it is you, my dear Manet, who revealed the secrets of the open air to us, Liebermann knows how to listen to the light in an enclosed space.&quot;

Instead of allowing himself to be absorbed by Impressionism, Liebermann stepped back from the sphere of popular light painting and turned back to the naturalism of Leibl in his &quot;Bleaching on the Lawn&quot; (1882–83). While he was working on this painting, Vincent van Gogh tried to meet Liebermann in Zweeloo, but he did not succeed. Back from the Netherlands, he followed Countess von Maltzan&#x27;s call to Militsch in Silesia, where he made his first commissioned work – a view of the village.

===Return to Berlin===

In 1884 Liebermann decided to return to his hometown Berlin, although he was aware that this would lead to inevitable conflicts. In his opinion, sooner or later Berlin would take on the role of the capital from an artistic point of view, as the largest art market was located there and he increasingly saw Munich&#x27;s traditions as a burden.

In May 1884 he was engaged to Martha Marckwald (1857–1943), who was the sister of his sister-in-law. The wedding ceremony took place on 14 September after the move from Munich to Berlin had been completed. The couple lived together for the first time, In den Zelten 11, on the northern edge of the zoo. However, the honeymoon did not lead to Italy, as was customary at the time, but via Braunschweig and Wiesbaden to Scheveningen in Holland. There Jozef Israëls joined the two; together they traveled to Laren, where Liebermann met the painter Anton Mauve. Further stops on the trip were Delden, Haarlem and Amsterdam. Liebermann produced studies everywhere and collected ideas that largely filled him up in the years that followed.

After his return he was accepted into the Association of Berlin Artists. Anton von Werner, his later adversary, also voted for his admission. In August 1885 Liebermann&#x27;s only daughter was born, who was given the name &quot;Marianne Henriette Käthe&quot;, but was only called Käthe. He painted little during this time, as he devoted himself entirely to the role of father.

Carl and Felicie Bernstein lived across from the Liebermann family. At his exceptionally cultivated neighbors, Liebermann saw paintings by Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas, which accompanied him throughout his subsequent life. In addition, he was able to feel for the first time in their circle as an accepted member of the Berlin artist community: Max Klinger, Adolph Menzel, Georg Brandes and Wilhelm Bode came and went there as well as Theodor Mommsen, Ernst Curtius and Alfred Lichtwark. The latter, the director of the Hamburger Kunsthalle, recognized Liebermann&#x27;s Impressionist potential early on. His entry into the Society of Friends also made it easier to achieve social acceptance in the bourgeois upper class.

After eight years of absence from Berlin, Liebermann took part in the exhibition of the Academy of the Arts again for the first time in 1886. For the exhibition he selected the paintings &quot;Freetime in the Amsterdam Orphanage&quot;, &quot;Altmannhaus in Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;The Grace&quot;, which depicts a Dutch peasant family praying in a gloomy, atmospheric setting and which was painted at the suggestion of Jozef Israël. The &quot;opinion maker&quot; Ludwig Pietsch described Liebermann as a great talent and an outstanding representative of modernism.

In the summer of 1886, Martha Liebermann went to Bad Homburg vor der Höhe for a cure with her daughter, which gave her husband the opportunity to study in Holland. He returned to Laren, where flax was made from raw linen in peasant cottages. Impressed by the subject of the collaborative work, Liebermann began to draw sketches and paint a first version in oil. In his Berlin studio he composed the studies for a painting in larger format, on which he was able to complete work in the spring of 1887. The representation of collective work should show the &quot;heroically patient&quot; in everyday life.

In May 1887 the picture was exhibited at the Paris Salon, where it was received with only muted applause. At the international anniversary exhibition in Munich, a critic described the painting as &quot;the real representation of dull infirmity caused by a monotony of hard work. […] Peasant women in worn aprons and wooden slippers, with faces that hardly show that they were young, the features of grim old age, lie in the chamber, the beams of which are oppressively weighed down, their mechanical daily work.&quot; Adolph Menzel, on the other hand praised the picture and described the painter as &quot;the only one who makes people and not models&quot;.

At this time, the art critic Emil Heilbut published a &quot;study on naturalism and Max Liebermann&quot;, in which he described the painter as &quot;the bravest forerunner of the new art in Germany&quot;. Kaiser Wilhelm I died in March 1888, followed by Friedrich III on the throne. With his reign there were hopes that Prussia would transform into a parliamentary monarchy, which ended only 99 days later with his death. Max Liebermann stayed in Bad Kösen in the spring of the three emperor year. From the death of Friedrich III. dismayed, he painted a fictional memorial service for Emperor Friedrich III. in Bad Kösen, which shows that, despite his left-wing political views, he developed profound sympathy to the Hohenzollern monarchy. He wanted to be a free spirit, but he was unable to reject the Prussian traditions because of his character.

In 1889 the world exhibition took place in Paris on the occasion of the centenary of the French Revolution. The monarchies of Russia, Great Britain and Austria-Hungary refused to participate because they rejected the celebration of the revolution. When the Germans Gotthardt Kuehl, Karl Koepping and Max Liebermann were appointed to the jury, this caused political explosive in Berlin. Liebermann inquired of the Prussian minister of education Gustav von Goßler, who let him do it – tantamount to unofficial support. At the same time, the newspaper &quot;La France&quot; stoked a campaign in Paris against the general participation of Prussia.

Liebermann came up with the plan to present the first guard of German painting with Menzel, Leibl, Wilhelm Trübner and Fritz von Uhde. The German press reproached him for serving up the idea of revolution. The old Adolph Menzel again took Liebermann&#x27;s side, and the first presentation of non-official German art on French soil took place. The world exhibition finally brought Liebermann into the limelight. In Paris he was honored with a medal of honor and admission to the Société des Beaux-Arts. He only refused the accolade of the Legion of Honor out of consideration for the Prussian government.

In 1889 Liebermann traveled to Katwijk, where he took leave of the social milieu as a subject with the painting &quot;Woman with Goats&quot;. After he was able to celebrate increasing success, he found the leisure to turn to images of easier life. In 1890 Liebermann received several commissions from Hamburg, all of which could be traced back to Alfred Lichtwark: In addition to a pastel in the Kirchenallee in St. Georg, he got his first portrait commission from there. After completing the painting based on Hals&#x27;s painting, the sitter, Mayor Carl Friedrich Petersen, was outraged. He found the naturalness of the representation in connection with the apparently casual official dignity bestowed by historicizing clothing repugnant. In Lichtwark&#x27;s eyes, the mayor&#x27;s portrait remained &quot;a failure&quot;. Liebermann had more success with his work &quot;Woman with Goats&quot;, for which he received the Great Gold Medal in the spring of 1891 at the exhibition of the Munich Art Association.

===The secession crisis===

Liebermann was the president of the Berlin Secession from its beginning in 1898. The Secession was a group of progressive artists who formed an independent exhibition society to promote modern art. Liebermann recruited prominent German Impressionists such as Lovis Corinth, Ernst Oppler and Max Slevogt for the Berlin Secession. In 1908 Walter Leistikow died, who as one of the founders had been an important pillar of the Secession. Liebermann&#x27;s health deteriorated from the spring of 1909, and while he went to Karlsbad for a cure, a generational conflict broke out between Impressionists and Expressionists. In 1910, the Secession board under Liebermann rejected 27 Expressionist images, and the former rebel now seemed a conservative spokesman. At the same time he initiated the disintegration of the Secession movement. Emil Nolde, representing the counterpart in this conflict, accused Liebermann of a fundamental hostility towards progress and of dictatorial power within the secession. Nonetheless, the Secession in 1910 exhibited works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and the Fauves for the first time. The Secession Committee stood behind its president and called Nolde&#x27;s approach a &quot;blatant hypocrisy&quot;. A general assembly was called, which voted 40 to 2 for the exclusion of Nolde. Liebermann himself had voted against the exclusion and stated in a defense speech: &quot;I am absolutely against the exclusion of the writer, even at the risk that similar motives [...] could lead to [...] such so-called &#x27;younger opposition&#x27;&quot;.

Through his own efforts to save Nolde&#x27;s honor, Liebermann had wanted to make his tolerance clear, but the split in the Secession movement could not be stopped. On the initiative of the Berlin painter Georg Tappert, followed by Max Pechstein and other artists, including Nolde, the New Secession was formed. On 15 May, it mounted its first exhibition under the title &quot;Rejected by the Secession Berlin 1910&quot;. Painters from Die Brücke and the Neue Künstlervereinigung München joined the New Secession. In the spring of 1911 Liebermann fled to Rome before the Secession crisis in Berlin. The death of his friend Jozef Israëls also fell at this time. The criticism of his leadership style grew louder until it finally came from within his own ranks: On 16 November 1911, Liebermann himself resigned as President of the Berlin Secession. Max Beckmann, Max Slevogt and August Gaul also took their leave. The general assembly elected Liebermann as its honorary president and entrusted Lovis Corinth with the leadership of the Secession. This decision anticipated the end of the Secession and sealed the decline of German Impressionism.

In 1909, Liebermann bought property in Wannsee, a wealthy suburb of summer homes on the outskirts of Berlin. There he had a country house built for himself by the architect Paul Otto August Baumgarten based on the examples of Hamburg patrician villas. The Liebermann Villa, which he moved into for the first time in the summer of 1910, is what he called his &quot;Schloss am See&quot;. Liebermann felt comfortable there and particularly enjoyed his personal design. He particularly enjoyed the large garden, which he and Alfred Lichtwark designed. From the 1910s until his death, images of the gardens dominated his work.

The first post-Liebermann&#x27;s annual Secession exhibition in 1912, under the chairmanship of Corinth, was unsuccessful. Liebermann again spent the summer of the year in Noordwijk. During a stay in The Hague, Queen Wilhelmina awarded him the House Order of Orange. The Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin made him an honorary doctorate, and the long-awaited appointment to the Senate of the Academy of Arts followed. The art academies in Vienna, Brussels, Milan and Stockholm made him their member. Citizens of Berlin who had rank and name had Liebermann portray them. At the beginning of 1913 Corinth resigned as chairman of the Secession with the entire board, Paul Cassirer was elected chairman. The honorary president tried to prevent this appointment of a non-artist, but did not want to &quot;step into the breach again&quot;. Cassirer excluded from the 1913 annual exhibition exactly those members who had voted against him in the general assembly. Unexpectedly, Lovis Corinth sided with them. Liebermann and other founding members of the Secession left the association in this second crisis. In February 1914, the &quot;Free Secession&quot; was finally founded, which continued the tradition of the first Secession movement. There was a hostility between Liebermann and Corinth that was symbolic for the Rumpfsecession and the Free Secession. Corinth tried to take action against Liebermann until his death, and in his autobiography he also drew a deeply disgusted picture of his colleague, who kept withdrawing from the limelight and devoted himself to his garden at Wannsee

===World War I===
Three weeks after the outbreak of the First World War, the 67-year-old Liebermann wrote: &quot;I continue to work as calmly as possible, in the opinion that I thereby serve the general best.&quot; Despite such statements, he was gripped by general patriotism. He devoted himself to artistic war propaganda and drew for the newspaper &quot;Kriegzeit – Künstlerflugblätter&quot;, which was published weekly by Paul Cassirer. The first edition showed a lithograph by Liebermann of the masses gathered at the beginning of the war in front of the Berlin City Palace on the occasion of Wilhelm II&#x27;s &quot;party speech&quot;. Liebermann understood the Emperor&#x27;s words as a call to serve the national cause and at the same time to lower social barriers. During this time, his double outsider role as a Jew and an artist could (at least apparently) be eliminated. Due to the emperor&#x27;s prosemitic appeal &quot;To my dear Jews&quot;, he also felt obliged to civilly participate in the war. The former pioneer of the Secession movement now stood completely on the soil of the empire. He identified with the castle peace policy of the Reich Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, who tried to bridge internal contradictions in German society. Bethmann Hollweg was portrayed by Liebermann in a lithograph in 1917.

In autumn 1914, Liebermann was one of the 93 signatories, mostly professors, writers and artists, of the appeal &quot;To the cultural world!&quot;, in which German war crimes were rejected with a six-fold &quot;It&#x27;s not true!&quot;. After the war, he expressed himself self-critically about this appeal: &quot;At the beginning of the war you didn&#x27;t think twice about it. People were united in solidarity with their country. I know well that the socialists have a different view. […] I&#x27;ve never been a socialist, and you don&#x27;t become one anymore at my age. I received my entire upbringing here, and I spent my entire life in this house, which my parents already lived in. And the German fatherland also lives in my heart as an inviolable and immortal concept.&quot;

He joined the German Society in 1914, in which public figures came together for political and private exchange under the chairmanship of the liberal-conservative politician Wilhelm Solf. The only condition was advocacy of the castle peace policy of Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg. The further the war progressed, the greater was Liebermann&#x27;s retreat into private life, to his country house on the Wannsee. But portrait painting was initially limited to the military, like Karl von Bülow. Even before the outbreak of war, Liebermann had been the undisputed portrait painter of the Berlin upper class. In this way, an enormous oeuvre of portraits was created that cemented Liebermann&#x27;s reputation as a painter of his era. For his great enthusiasm for the war, however, he later had to take strong criticism. The art writer Julius Meier-Graefe wrote about the lithographs during the war: &quot;Today some people give up their cow and cabbage and suddenly discover new motifs during the war, others come up with the idea of handing their polo players a saber and imagine that this is how you create a winner.&quot;

Liebermann never left Berlin with the exception of two spa stays in Wiesbaden in 1915 and 1917. After 1913 he no longer spent the summers in the Netherlands, but at the Wannsee, while in the winter he lived at Pariser Platz. His family did not suffer hardship, even if they used the flower beds of his country house to grow vegetables because of the insecurity of supplies. In May 1915, Käthe Liebermann, the painter&#x27;s now almost 30-year-old daughter, married the diplomat Kurt Riezler, who, as an advisor to Bethmann Hollweg, had close contacts in politics. In that year Anton von Werner died, as it were as a symbol of an ending era, as did Liebermann&#x27;s cousin Emil Rathenau. The founding generation parted, and a new era was about to begin.

In April 1916 Liebermann&#x27;s essay &quot;The Fantasy in Painting&quot; appeared for the first time in book form. In the rewritten introduction he wrote: &quot;Were the aesthetic views more confused than they are today? – Where a younger art historian Wilhelm Worringer writes from the trenches of Flanders that war decides not only for the existence of Germany, but also for the victory of Expressionism.&quot; When &quot;Kriegzeit&quot; in 1916 changed its name to &quot;Bildermann&quot;, Liebermann gave up his participation. Instead, he dealt with illustration for the first time: In 1916 and 1917, he produced works on Goethe&#x27;s novella and &quot;The Man of Fifty Years&quot;, as well as Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Small Writings&quot;. His illustrative style describes the atmosphere at turning points in dramaturgy and was not designed for narration, which is why he did not make a breakthrough in this area and soon stopped working on illustrations for ten years.

In 1917 the Prussian Academy of the Arts dedicated a large retrospective of his work to Liebermann for his 70th birthday. Almost 200 paintings were shown in the exhibition. Julius Elias, whose wife Julie Elias dedicated her famous cookbook to Liebermann, called the honors for the painter &quot;a coronation&quot;. The director of the National Gallery, Ludwig Justi (Tschudis&#x27; successor), promised him his own cabinet. Wilhelm II agreed to the birthday exhibition and awarded Liebermann the Order of the Red Eagle, 3rd class. The honoree noted with satisfaction that His Majesty had buried the hatchet against modern art. Walther Rathenau published an essay on the exhibition in the Berliner Tageblatt: &quot;In Liebermann, the new, metropolitan mechanized Prussia paints itself. It had to be a person of spirit and will, of struggle, of passion and reflection.&quot;

On 18 January 1918, the opening ceremony of the Max Liebermann Cabinet of the National Gallery took place. The inauguration speech was given by the Minister of Education, Friedrich Schmidt-Ott. A few weeks later, 500,000 workers struck in Berlin alone – the Reich was on the verge of upheaval. When the November Revolution finally broke out, Liebermann was staying at the house on Pariser Platz. Machine guns of the monarchists were installed in his own house, which is why the soldiers of the revolutionaries attacked the palace. After a bullet went through the wall on the first floor into the drawing room, the defenders surrendered. After this incident, Liebermann brought his valuable picture collection to safety and moved with his wife into their daughter&#x27;s house for a few weeks. Liebermann took a negative view of the political changes: although he advocated the introduction of equal suffrage in Prussia and democratic-parliamentary reforms at the imperial level, for him &quot;a whole world, albeit a rotten one&quot;, collapsed. He had already regretted Bethmann Hollweg&#x27;s departure in 1917 and saw republicanization as a missed opportunity for a parliamentary monarchy. &quot;We&#x27;ve been through bad times now. [...] Berlin is ragged, dirty, dark in the evening, [...] a dead city, plus soldiers selling matches or cigarettes on Friedrichstrasse or Unter den Linden, blind organ grinders in half-rotten uniforms, in one word: pitiful.&quot;

===Weimar years===
After the end of the war and the revolution, Liebermann took over the office of President of the Berlin Academy of the Arts in 1920. The secessions continued to exist in parallel until they fell apart almost silently. Liebermann tried to unite the various currents under the umbrella of the academy, including expressionism. In the opening speech of the academy exhibition, he said: &quot;Anyone who has experienced the rejection of Impressionism in his youth will be careful not to condemn a movement that he does not or does not yet understand, especially as head of the academy that although conservative by nature, it would freeze if it behaved in a purely negative manner towards the youth.&quot; With this he had returned to the liberality of the time before the secession crisis and was now trying to steer the fate of the academy with tolerance.

In view of the need to rebuild the collapsed imperial institution, Liebermann succeeded in providing it with a democratic structure, a free educational system and, at the same time, greater public attention. Through his advocacy, Max Pechstein, Karl Hofer, Heinrich Zille, Otto Dix and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff were accepted into the academy.

During the Weimar Republic, Liebermann was in constant demand as a portrait painter. He also painted a large number of self-portraits, as had been his habit since 1902.

In 1922, Walther Rathenau was murdered by right-wing activists. Liebermann was deeply disturbed by the murder of his relative and companion. He made lithographs for Heinrich Heine&#x27;s &quot;Rabbi von Bacharach&quot; in addition to numerous paintings of his garden and drawings in memory of fallen Jewish soldiers at the front. In 1923 Liebermann was accepted into the order Pour le Mérite. On 7 October 1924, his younger brother Felix Liebermann, who had also been a friend of his life, died. Only two days later he had to mourn the death of his relative Hugo Preuss, the father of the Weimar constitution. Liebermann withdrew more and more into himself and his garden, and often appeared surly.

Nevertheless, he continued to advocate artistic progressiveness and political art, even though his own works were regarded as &quot;classics&quot; or disapprovingly as old-fashioned. He supported Otto Dix&#x27;s painting &quot;Trench&quot;, which emotionally depicted the horror of the world war and which was accused of being a &quot;tendentious work&quot;; for Liebermann it was &quot;one of the most important works of the post-war period&quot;. At the same time, despite his basically tolerant views, he polemicized against Ludwig Justi, who brought Expressionists to the Nationalgalerie for an exhibition. In September 1926, Liebermann wrote in the &quot;Jüdisch-Liberalen Zeitung&quot;. In the Yom Kippur edition he publicly confessed to his faith, to which he increasingly found his way back in old age. He also supported the Jewish children&#x27;s home &quot;Ahawah&quot; and the aid association of German Jews.

In 1927 Liebermann came back into the public eye: the media and the art world celebrated him and his work on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Among the well-wishers were the Berlin veteran Zille as well as international greats such as Albert Einstein, Heinrich and Thomas Mann as well as Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Never before has a German artist been honored by his hometown in such a way as Berlin did with the more than 100 paintings by Liebermann&#x27;s birthday exhibition. His life&#x27;s work now appeared classic, the formerly provocative style in 1927 looked like documents from a bygone era. This is why the old Liebermann countered critics who accused him of seclusion and conservatism in the exhibition catalog: &quot;The curse of our time is the addiction to the new [...]: the true artist strives for nothing else than: to become who he is.&quot;

His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

The city of Berlin granted him honorary citizenship, which, however, was heatedly contested in the city council. On his birthday, Reich President Paul von Hindenburg honored Liebermann with the eagle shield of the German Reich &quot;as a token of the thanks that the German people owe you&quot;. Interior Minister Walter von Keudell presented him with the Golden State Medal embossed with &quot;For services to the state&quot;. At the end of 1927, Liebermann portrayed President Hindenburg. Although he did not confess to him politically, he gladly accepted the assignment and felt it was a further honor. The portrait sessions of their peers were characterized by mutual respect and a certain amount of sympathy. In Hindenburg, the &quot;old master of German modernism&quot; saw a veteran Prussian patriot who could not possibly derail into irrationality. Liebermann wrote: &quot;The other day a Hitler paper wrote – it was sent to me – that it would be unheard of for a Jew to paint the Reich President. I can only laugh at something like that. I&#x27;m convinced that when Hindenburg finds out, he&#x27;ll laugh about it too. I&#x27;m just a painter, and what does painting have to do with Judaism?&quot; The writer Paul Eipper held his &quot;studio talks&quot; about his meeting with Liebermann on 25 March 1930 in his house on Pariser Platz in Berlin firmly: &quot;We&#x27;re talking about Hindenburg. He (Liebermann) is enthusiastic about him.&quot;

Liebermann was a popular subject for painters, photographers and caricaturists throughout his life. In addition to Lovis Corinth, he was also painted by the Swede Anders Zorn and the Dutchman Jan Veth, photographed by Yva and several times by Nicola Perscheid, and caricatured by Heinrich Zille, among others. The sculptor Fritz Klimsch made a bronze bust in 1912, which was exhibited in 1917 at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in Düsseldorf.

Due to illness, Liebermann resigned his post as president of the academy in 1932, but was also elected honorary president. Through the treatment of his friend Ferdinand Sauerbruch (Sauerbruch made Liebermann&#x27;s trapped hernia disappear in the Charité, on which occasion Liebermann had also portrayed the surgeon in the draft), Liebermann&#x27;s neighbor at Wannsee since 1928, the painter recovered. The portraits that he made of Sauerbruch represent the conclusion of his portrait work and are also its climax. For the last time he turned to an individually new motif.

===Nazi persecution===

30 January 1933 was the day when power was handed over to the National Socialists. While watching the Nazis celebrate their victory by marching through the Brandenburg Gate, Liebermann was reported to have commented: &quot;Ich kann gar nicht soviel fressen, wie ich kotzen möchte.&quot; (&quot;I could not possibly eat as much as I would like to throw up.&quot;).

Liebermann did not want to risk defending himself against the incipient change in cultural policy — as Käthe Kollwitz, Heinrich Mann or Erich Kästner did by signing the urgent appeal in June 1932. &quot;The natural thing would be to escape. But for me, as a Jew, that would be viewed as cowardice.&quot;

Like other Jewish artists, Liebermann was persecuted as a Jew, and his works were removed from public collections.

On 7 May 1933 Liebermann resigned from his honorary presidency, senatorial posts and membership in the Prussian Academy of the Arts, explaining to the press: &quot;During my long life I have tried, with all my might, to serve German art. In my opinion, art has nothing to do with politics or ancestry. I can no longer belong to the Prussian Academy of the Arts...since my point of view is no longer valued.&quot;

On the advice of the Swiss banker Adolf Jöhr, he was able to deposit the 14 most important works of his art collection from May 1933 at the Kunsthaus Zürich, where Wilhelm Wartmann was director.

He withdrew from the public eye, while hardly any of his companions stood by him and remained loyal. Only Käthe Kollwitz was still looking for access to him. One last self-portrait was created in 1934. Liebermann confessed to one of his last visitors: &quot;I only live out of hate. [...] I no longer look out the window of this room – I don&#x27;t want to see the new world around me.&quot;

===Death===
Liebermann died on 8 February 1935 in his house on Pariser Platz. Käthe Kollwitz reported that he fell asleep quietly at seven in the evening. The death mask was made by Arno Breker, who was Hitler&#x27;s preferred sculptor during this time. The photographer Charlotte Rohrbach took the plaster mask.

His death was not covered in the media, which had already been brought into line, and was only mentioned in passing – if at all. The Academy of Arts, which in the meantime had become an instrument of the National Socialists, refused to honor the former president. For example, no official representative appeared at his funeral at the Schönhauser Allee Jewish cemetery on 11 February 1935 – neither from the academy nor from the city, of which he had been an honorary citizen since 1927. The Gestapo had even forbidden participation in the funeral in advance, fearing that it might turn into a demonstration for artistic freedom. Nevertheless, almost 100 friends and relatives came. Among the mourners were Käthe Kollwitz, Hans Purrmann and his wife Mathilde Vollmoeller-Purrmann, Konrad von Kardorff, Leo Klein von Diepold, Otto Nagel, Ferdinand Sauerbruch with his son Hans Sauerbruch, Bruno Cassirer, Georg Kolbe, Max J. Friedländer, Friedrich Sarre and Adolph Goldschmidt. According to Saul Friedländer, only three &quot;Aryan&quot; artists attended the funeral. In his funeral speech, Karl Scheffler pointed out that Liebermann was not just burying a great artist, but an epoch for which he was symbolic.

His daughter, Katharina Riezler, fled to the United States in 1938.

==Nazi-looted art==
In addition to his own art, Liebermann was an important collector of art, notably of French Impressionists, for which he was the largest collector in Germany. Both Liebermann and many of his collectors were persecuted by the Nazis and their agents because they were Jewish. Artworks were stolen from his Jewish collectors and many have never been recovered. Liebermann&#x27;s own extensive collection, which he bequeathed to his wife, Martha, after his death, was later looted from her apartment. Martha committed suicide in 1943 after she learned she was going to be deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp. About six months later, the Gestapo confiscated most of Liebermann&#x27;s famous private art collection. The Palais Liebermann on Pariser Platz soon sank in ruins.

The German Lost Art Foundation lists hundreds of artworks that were either created by or owned by Max Liebermann in its official Lost Art database.

Claims for restitution for Nazi-looted art have been filed by both Max Liebermann&#x27;s heirs and the heirs of his Jewish patrons whose collections were looted.

The Liebermann family has been trying to recover a portrait of Martha Liebermann that was on a Gestapo list of objects seized from her apartment for years.

When the art hoard of the son of Hitler&#x27;s art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt was discovered in Munich in 2013, one of the first artworks to be proven to have been looted by the Nazis was Liebermann&#x27;s &quot;Two Riders on the Beach&quot; that had belonged to the Jewish collector David Friedmann.

Max Silberberg, the famous Jewish art collector from Breslau who was murdered in Auschwitz had several artworks by Liebermann that were looted by the Nazis. Some have been restituted.

==Commemoration==
In 2005/2006, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles and the Jewish Museum in New York mounted the first major museum exhibition in the United States of Liebermann&#x27;s work.

On 30 April 2006, the Max Liebermann Society opened a permanent museum in the Liebermann family&#x27;s villa in the Wannsee district of Berlin. The artist&#x27;s wife, Martha Liebermann, was forced to sell the villa in 1940. On 5 March 1943, at the age of 85 and bedridden from a stroke, she was notified to get ready for deportation to Theresienstadt concentration camp. Instead, she committed suicide in the family home, Haus Liebermann, hours before police arrived to take her away. There is a stolperstein for her in front of their former home by the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

In 2011, the Israel Museum returned a painting to the Max Liebermann estate, decades after the masterpiece was looted from a Jewish museum in Nazi Germany. Liebermann had loaned his painting to the Jewish Museum in Berlin in the 1930s. The work, along with many others, disappeared from the museum during World War II.

<text>Species II is a 1998 American science fiction horror thriller film directed by Peter Medak. The film is a sequel to &quot;Species&quot; (1995) and the second installment of the &quot;Species&quot; series. The film stars Michael Madsen, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger, Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza, James Cromwell and Justin Lazard. In addition to Madsen and Helgenberger reprising their roles, Henstridge also returned for the sequel as a new character. The plot has Patrick Ross, the astronaut son of a senator, being infected by an extraterrestrial organism during a mission to Mars and causing the deaths of many women upon his return. To stop him, the scientists who created the human-extraterrestrial hybrid Sil in the original &quot;Species&quot; try using a more docile clone of hers, Eve.

The film was theatrically released on April 10, 1998. Compared to its predecessor, the film was panned by critics and was a box-office bomb, only grossing $30 million worldwide, and $19.2 million domestically. Despite this, a made-for-television sequel, &quot;Species III&quot;, was released in 2004.

== Plot ==
While participating in a human mission to Mars, astronauts led by Commander Patrick Ross, Anne Sampas, and Dennis Gamble collect soil samples. While returning to Earth, the soil thaws and releases an alien substance that contaminates them and causes a brief contact gap with mission control. The trio return to Earth to public celebration, but an institutionalized former scientist, Dr. Cromwell, reacts to their return with violent panic. They are examined and quarantined to prevent them from engaging in sexual activity for ten days. However, Ross ignores this and has sex with two women. To his horror, the pair undergo accelerated pregnancies and die giving birth to human/alien hybrids, which he hides in his father&#x27;s remote shed.

Meanwhile, under military supervision, scientists led by Dr. Laura Baker have created a more docile clone of Sil named Eve in an effort to understand the alien life form and prepare for defense should it ever arrive on Earth. While in isolation and undergoing tests, Eve shows signs of great physiological excitement every time Patrick has sex. At the space center, Patrick sneaks into the lab and kills Dr. Orinsky, who was trying to contact Dr. Cromwell about the astronauts&#x27; blood samples. Analysis of the corpse reveals the presence of alien DNA, similar to, yet distinct from, Eve&#x27;s. Baker reunites with former colleague Preston &quot;Press&quot; Lennox to contain the new threat and contact Cromwell, who reveals Mars was rendered uninhabitable by an alien species, he was institutionalized to silence his opposition to the Mars mission, and Orinsky tried to call him to confirm his fears.

Press and Laura find Sampas as she has sex with her husband, only to suddenly become impregnated with an alien newborn, which kills the Sampases before Press and Baker kill the creature in turn. After government agents determine Gamble was not infected, the latter joins Baker and Press in their mission. Concurrently, Ross awakens to find his fiancée dead, having given birth to another hybrid. Horrified, he commits suicide, but his alien DNA takes over and regenerates his body before going on a killing spree to produce more offspring.

The scientists activate Eve&#x27;s alien DNA so she can telepathically track Ross. Picking up on this, he gives himself up to Press and Gamble to infiltrate the lab and reach Eve as she goes into heat. However, he is chased off by Laura, Gamble, and Press. That night, Ross commands his offspring to form a cocoon so they can reach their adult stages and repeat the cycle on a global scale. After Baker discovers Gamble resisted infection because of his sickle cell trait, she plans to kill Ross with Gamble&#x27;s DNA as the alien lacks immunity to human genetic diseases.

As Eve escapes to find him, the team track her to Ross&#x27;s nest, where she and Ross mate until they are interrupted by Press. The team kill most of Ross&#x27;s offspring. Baker pleads Eve to help them, but a betrayed Ross seemingly kills her. Press uses a pitchfork to draw Gamble&#x27;s blood and use it on Ross, killing him. While the military arrive to escort the team away, Eve is loaded into an ambulance, where she is joined by Ross&#x27;s remaining offspring while her womb rapidly swells, the screen the goes black, leading to the events of the third film.

== Development ==
Writer Chris Brancato was working with MGM on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, and knew the studio was interested in making a follow-up to &quot;Species&quot;. He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it, but once Brancato went to &quot;Species&quot; producer Frank Mancuso Jr., he asked to &quot;approach this from a different angle, so that we don&#x27;t have a tired retread of the original, as sequels often are&quot;. With that in mind, Brancato took inspiration from &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, where &quot;somebody on a mission comes back, apparently a hero, but actually with some terrible demon inside&quot;, and as &quot;the notion of a grand, unexplored place was the planet Mars&quot;, he made the first astronaut on Mars – as according to NASA scientists consulted by Brancato, human exploration of Mars was &quot;a possibility – just a very expensive one&quot; – be infected by alien DNA. Mancuso approved the idea, and thus Brancato explored how this new villain was one &quot;for whom we can briefly feel a strange, Wolf Man-like sympathy – he&#x27;s not responsible for having been turned into a monster&quot; and had him face an alien woman similar to Sil, raising the doubt on whether they would battle or mate. As Natasha Henstridge was unconfirmed to return, Brancato wrote the new female, Eve, as if it was &quot;either Natasha or a similarly beautiful woman&quot;. Henstridge still liked the script enough and the idea of working with director Peter Medak to sign for the sequel. Brancato decided to bring back two of the surviving characters from &quot;Species&quot;, Michael Madsen&#x27;s Press Lennox and Marg Helgenberger&#x27;s Dr. Laura Baker feeling they &quot;were essential to bring the audience back in&quot;, but knowing Forest Whitaker was probably too busy to return as Dan Smithson, he wrote a similar African American character in the one eventually portrayed by Mykelti Williamson. Mancuso had another script done simultaneously to Brancato&#x27;s, which reportedly explored the cliffhanger ending of &quot;Species&quot; where a rat was infected after eating Sil&#x27;s remains. Mancuso brought in Peter Medak, responsible for the 1980 horror film &quot;The Changeling&quot;.

The nature of the alien species is explored to a slightly greater extent in the second film. A professor claims that they originated in the Large Magellanic Cloud (also called the Magellanic Galaxy), due to it apparently being the only other place carbon-based life forms have been discovered. It is also stipulated that they were a &quot;cancerous&quot; race that visited Mars millions of years ago and annihilated all life on its surface (which is described in the film as being Earth-like at that time) before leaving a remnant of their own DNA in its soil. This DNA was intended to be picked up by other visitors so that their species could continue to infect other inhabited planets.

The Species basically appear to be bipedal (humanoid) forms. Unlike other aliens in the &quot;Species&quot; series, however, Patrick Ross has two types of alien forms: mating form and combat form. Patrick&#x27;s alien form for copulation is bipedal, humanoid, and male version of Eve&#x27;s, while Patrick&#x27;s alien form for combat (so-called &#x27;Fighting Patrick&#x27;) is quadrupedal, bigger, and more &#x27;brutish&#x27; in appearance than Eve. His second stage appearance is also similar to the Xenomorphs of the &quot;Alien&quot; films; both were designed with input from H. R. Giger.

== Release ==
=== Home media ===
&quot;Species II&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on October 20, 1998.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film ranked number four on its opening weekend behind &quot;City of Angels&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, with earnings of $7.4 million. Domestically, the film grossed only $19.2 million from its $35 million budget. It grossed $26,817,565 worldwide, making the film a major commercial failure.

=== Critical response ===
The film received worse reviews than its predecessor. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 9% at based on 34 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Clumsily exploitative and sloppily assembled, &quot;Species II&quot; fails to clear the rather low bar set by its less-than-stellar predecessor&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 19% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale. At the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Sequel but lost to &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;.

Dwayne E. Leslie from &quot;Box Office Magazine&quot; gave the film 1 out of 5 stars calling it &quot;a sequel that doesn&#x27;t measure up&quot;, also heavily criticizing the film&#x27;s predictable and open ending. Joe Leydon from &quot;Variety&quot; magazine called the film &quot;a half-baked rehash&quot;. He praised the special effects and technical aspects of the film but added &quot;that&#x27;s not nearly enough to camouflage the inherent crumminess&quot;. James Berardinelli described the film as awful but added &quot;there&#x27;s enough blood, gore, simulated sex, and bare flesh to prevent it from ever becoming boring&quot;.

Co-star Michael Madsen was displeased with the film according to his statement in a 2004 interview.

In the DVD commentary director Peter Medak praised the films&#x27; special effects. He expressed his opinion that audiences had too much expectation as this was a very different sequel due to not continuing from the story with the alien-infected rat that survived the finale, which hinted at a sequel in the 1995 original. Medak also admitted being uncomfortable with the amount of nudity in the film but said it was for the purpose of the story.

=== Merchandise ===
To coincide with the film, McFarlane Toys released an Eve and Patrick (in their alien form) action figure as part of their inaugural series of Movie Maniacs action figures. Both action figures came with a replica of the film&#x27;s poster with skulls and bones base. Eve came with an alternate head. Two Eve action figures were produced which was dubbed the PG and R rated version. The R rated Eve action figure (in her alien form) had nipples on her breasts while the PG figure didn&#x27;t. The R rated figure was released only in comic book and other collectable stores while the PG figure was released in toy stores.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack on CD includes a track by B.B. King, one by Apollo 440, and 9 score pieces composed by Edward Shearmur.

== Novelization ==

As with the first film, Yvonne Navarro wrote a novelization based on the original screenplay which gives plot and character details not seen in the film. For example, the book tells how, due to limited knowledge of the outside world, Eve does not know if Superman is a real life personality or not. It is also hinted that she was able to learn a degree of martial arts by watching old action films.

In the film, Eve is shot by soldiers, but after being briefly incapacitated her body regenerates and she continues to escape. Soldiers continue to shoot at her, but Eve manages to run past them; why she is unharmed is left unexplained. The book explains that her skin adapts (in a way similar to how her body adapts to the gas test earlier in the film), becoming bulletproof.

Other details in the book that do not appear in the film include an earlier escape attempt by Eve, and Patrick discovering new senses in a restaurant with his fiancé. In the novel, the debutante is a young, sexy, brown-eyed blonde, whereas in the film, she is an older woman who is a brunette. The debutante&#x27;s sister in the novel isn&#x27;t her sister but her best friend from college who often engaged in sexual games that involved seducing men.

The order of events in the novel differs from their order in the film. For example, Patrick does not encounter the debutante at the fundraiser until after Orinsky is killed by him, and Cromwell is not visited by Laura and Press until they discover Orinsky&#x27;s corpse.

<text>The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair was an international diplomatic incident that occurred during the American Civil War. On December 7, 1863, Confederate sympathizers from the British colonies Nova Scotia and New Brunswick captured the American steamer &quot;Chesapeake&quot; off the coast of Cape Cod. The expedition was planned and led by Vernon Guyon Locke (1827–1890) of Nova Scotia and John Clibbon Brain (1840–1906). When George Wade of New Brunswick killed one of the American crew, the Confederacy claimed its first fatality in New England waters. 

The Confederate sympathizers had planned to re-coal at Saint John, New Brunswick, and head south to Wilmington, North Carolina. Instead, the captors had difficulties at Saint John; so they sailed further east and re-coaled in Halifax, Nova Scotia. U.S. forces responded to the attack, violating British sovereignty by trying to arrest the captors in Nova Scotian waters. International tensions rose. Wade and others were able to escape through the assistance of William Johnston Almon, a prominent Nova Scotian and Confederate sympathizer.

The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair was one of the most sensational international incidents that occurred during the American Civil War. The incident briefly threatened to bring the British Empire into the war against the North.

== Historical context ==
While slavery had effectively ended in Nova Scotia at the beginning of the 19th century, the British ended the practice of slave-owning throughout its Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. When the Civil War began, most Canadians and Maritimers were overtly sympathetic to the North, which had abolished slavery after the Revolution and which had trading ties. At the beginning of the war, approximately 20,000 men from British North America, almost half of them Maritimers, crossed the border to fight, primarily for the North. Many families had strong kinship ties across the border with people in New England, New York and some of the Midwest.

As the war went on, relations between Britain and the North became strained for numerous reasons, and sympathy turned toward the South. Britain declared itself neutral during the war. Increased trade went through Halifax to both Northern and Southern ports. Nova Scotia&#x27;s economy thrived throughout the war. This trade created strong ties between Halifax and merchants from both the North and South. In Halifax the main commercial agent for the Confederacy was Benjamin Wier and Co. – a company that flew the Confederate flag outside its office and accepted Confederate currency. The informal headquarters for the Confederates was located at the Waverley Hotel, 1266 Barrington Street (present-day Waverley Inn). At the same time, Halifax became the leading supplier of coal and fish to the North.

While trade with the South was flourishing, the North created a naval blockade to prevent supplies getting to the South. Hundreds of blockade runners loaded with British arms and supplies would use the port of Halifax to ship their goods between Britain and the Confederate States. Much of the coal and other fuels used to run Confederate steamers went through Halifax. Halifax&#x27;s role in arms trafficking for the South was so noticeable that the &quot;Acadian Recorder&quot; in 1864 described the city&#x27;s effort as a &quot;mercenary aid to a fratricidal war, which, without outside intervention, would have long ago ended.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward complained on March 14, 1865:
Halifax has been for more than one year, and yet is, a naval station for vessels which, running the blockade, furnish supplies and munitions of war to our enemy, and it has been made a rendezvous for those piratical cruisers which come out from Liverpool and Glasgow, to destroy our commerce on the high seas, and even to carry war into the ports of the United States. Halifax is a postal and despatch station in the correspondence between the rebels at Richmond and their emissaries in Europe. Halifax merchants are known to have surreptitiously imported provisions, arms, and ammunition from our seaports, and then transshipped them to the rebels. The governor of Nova Scotia has been neutral, just, and friendly; so were the judges of the province who presided on the trial of the Chesapeake. But then it is understood that, on the other hand, merchant shippers of Halifax, and many of the people of Halifax, are willing agents and abettors of the enemies of the United States, and their hostility has proved not merely offensive but deeply injurious.
Immediately following the 1863 &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair, Seward notified the Canadian government that:
The recent shipment of one thousand rifles [by pro-Confederate British sympathizers] from New York to Halifax in violation of military regulations, the recently discovered plans of Confederate &#x27;pirates&#x27; at Halifax to capture other American steamers between New York and Halifax, the plans of &#x27;neutral passengers&#x27; to carry forbidden and treasonable mails to the insurgents and the plans of &#x27;neutral merchants&#x27; to carry war supplies. 
Canadians and Maritimers became fearful of the power that the North demonstrated in defeating the South, and worried that it might want to annex British North America next. Toronto, Montreal, St. Catharines, and Halifax were centers of a well-financed network of Confederate spies, escaped prisoners, and soldiers of fortune who were trying to influence government opinion in the war. The Confederates arranged various attacks on the Union from Canada, such as the raid on St. Albans, Vermont. The plan to kill President Abraham Lincoln was made in the St. Lawrence Hall hotel in Montreal. The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair was the result of a plan created in Saint John, New Brunswick, by Confederate sympathizers: they intended to capture an American ship and use it as a blockade runner for the South.

== Capture ==
Locke had arranged for John C. Braine and sixteen Confederate sympathizers from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to board the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; as normal passengers in New York. While en route to Maine, on the night of 7 December, just off the coast of Cape Cod, Braine and his men seized control of the vessel. The crew resisted; in the exchange of gunfire that took place, the ship&#x27;s second engineer was killed, and three crewmen were wounded. After seizing the vessel, Locke took command at Grand Manan Island.

Neutrality regulations forbade the bringing of prizes into British waters. Locke sailed &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Saint John, New Brunswick, as planned but was unable to load coal for the voyage south. He next took &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Nova Scotia. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; stopped at Shelburne (10 December) and at Conquerall Bank, Nova Scotia, on the LaHave River (14 December), where they loaded some coal. During the next two days, they sold some of the stolen cargo for supplies.

In the meantime, two Union warships were closing in: the fast side-wheeler , moving south from Halifax, and the , coming north from Shelburne.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot; was nearly caught by &quot;Malvern&quot; on the LaHave River. Under the cover of night, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; turned all lights out and slipped behind Spectacle Island and out on the LaHave without being detected. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; again avoided capture at Lunenburg and traveled on to Halifax. The vessel moved through Mahone Bay. At St. Margarets Bay, some crew left the ship. By 16 December, the ship arrived at Mud Cove harbour at Sambro. Once there Locke went to Halifax overland. There he arranged for a schooner come to Sambro with coal. While &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was being loaded with coal, &quot;Malvern&quot; and &quot;Dacotah&quot; arrived.

== Arrest ==
Upon the arrival of the American warships, most of the rebel prize crew on &quot;Chesapeake&quot; fled. Lieutenant Nickels of &quot;Malvern&quot; violated British sovereignty and international laws by arresting the three men who remained: one from New Brunswick and two from Nova Scotia. George Wade, who had killed a crew member during the raid, was among the prisoners. The Americans took &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Halifax to get clearance for their actions from the British authorities. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; arrived in Halifax on 17 December, escorted by the two American warships. Three other warships followed, which had also pursued &quot;Chesapeake&quot;: , , and .

News of the capture and the fact that Maritimers were the assailants resulted in widespread anger in the North. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; condemned the attack as the &quot;most daring and atrocious on record&quot; and the assailants for showing &quot;cold blood and feeble circulation of reptiles.&quot; Another paper derided the citizens of Saint John as &quot;mere pimps&quot; of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and &quot;his fellow traitors.&quot;

Seward informed Britain that the U.S. wanted &quot;Chesapeake&quot; returned immediately, and the hijackers arrested and extradited to the U.S. in accordance with Article 10 of the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which provided the extradition of &quot;all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder ... or Piracy&quot;.

== Escape ==

William Johnston Almon was generally regarded as the unofficial Confederate consul in Halifax. He constantly harboured Confederate &quot;refugees&quot; and hosted numerous prominent Confederate officials, who were automatically welcomed at Rosebank during their stay in town. He was a friend and correspondent of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He worked with Alexander Keith, Jr. to free the Confederates.

The fate of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; awaited adjudication in the colonial Admiralty court, but the British planned to give Confederate prisoner Wade to the United States authorities for extradition. Almon and Keith arranged for Wade&#x27;s escape in a rowboat to Ketch Harbour and to Hantsport. The Americans were outraged and, in response, the British put a warrant out for the rest of his crew. A few of the crew were tried but were found not guilty on a technicality.

== Aftermath ==
The Southern sympathisers believed they were engaging in an act of war because they had an official letter of marque from the Confederacy. As the investigation into the affair unfolded, it was found their letter had no legal basis. As a result, rather than the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair being an official act of war, it was an act of piracy and condemned as such by most of the newspapers in the Maritimes.

Many high-ranking Confederates settled in Canada after the war. Approximately 30 senior Naval and Army officers from the South settled in Halifax. Among the most prominent were John Wilkinson (commander of CSS &quot;Chickamauga&quot;), Thomas Edgeworth Courtenay, and John Taylor Wood.

<text>CIMX-FM (88.7 MHz, &quot;Pure Country 89&quot;) is a commercial radio station in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It primarily serves Essex County, but has a signal that reaches the entire Detroit-Windsor metropolitan area. It is owned by Bell Media and airs a country format. CIMX&#x27;s studios and offices are located on Ouellette Avenue in Windsor.

CIMX has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 78,200 watts, with a maximum of 100,000 watts. The transmitter is located off South Industrial Drive in Amherstburg.

==History==
===CKWW-FM===
What is now CIMX first signed on the air on July 10, 1967, as CKWW-FM. It was co-owned with CKWW but was separately programmed. The stations shared studios and offices at 1150 Ouellette Avenue.

CKWW-FM had an MOR/easy listening format. The station added evening progressive rock programming in the fall of 1970.

===Om FM===
The following April, the station changed its call sign to CJOM-FM and the progressive format went full-time. &quot;Om FM&quot; (pronounced &quot;Ohm FM&quot;) distinguished itself from its Detroit competitors WRIF, WWWW and WABX by emphasizing Canadian talent.

By 1976, the album rock sounds of &quot;Om FM&quot; had faded away and the station was again programming MOR and easy listening music.

===Top 40 Era===
In 1982, CJOM and CKWW were acquired by Geoff Stirling&#x27;s company, Stirling Communications International, which also owned CKGM in Montreal, Quebec and CHOZ-FM in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. CJOM made an abrupt switch to a CHR/Top 40 format. In the evening hours, 1983-85, DJ Karen Evans played more alternative music with an introduction of British new wave music to the market. In the late 1980s, the station went by the moniker &quot;Laser Rock,&quot; a reference to becoming one of the first radio stations in the Detroit area to program music solely from compact discs.

CJOM ran afoul of the CRTC in the summer of 1983 for its format change to CHR/Top 40. Then as now, all radio station format changes in Canada must be approved by the CRTC. CJOM had been approved for a &quot;contemporary MOR&quot; (a.k.a. adult contemporary) format, but analyses of the station&#x27;s programming in May 1983 showed that almost all of the music being played was rock-oriented, that the station was playing 78% &quot;hit&quot; music rather than the allowed &lt;50%, and that the station was not meeting its licence commitments for &quot;foreground&quot;, &quot;mosaic&quot;, spoken word, or news programming.

Stirling maintained that the station was &quot;experimenting&quot; with its programming and that such a format was necessary in order to make the station competitive with Detroit-based broadcasters. Stirling and the CRTC finally reached a compromise in August 1985. CJOM was granted an &quot;experimental&quot; licence which would enable the station to play more harder-edged rock and pop music with higher repetition, although a proposal to reduce the station&#x27;s Canadian Content quotient to 5% from 15% was denied. 

Under this experimental licence, CJOM remained a CHR-formatted radio station for most of the rest of the decade. Most rock songs played were Top 40 based like songs from Def Leppard and Billy Squier or Canadian artists such as Platinum Blonde, Haywire, and Gino Vannelli. CJOM would occasionally include several songs by one artist in a &quot;star set&quot; during the day. On Sunday evenings, CJOM would broadcast an &quot;album countdown&quot; in which the station would play several songs from the same album in the countdown.

===Studios and tower===
In 1987, CJOM increased its transmitting power to 100,000 watts from a tower in McGregor. Before this, the station&#x27;s signal did not extend much further than the Detroit/Windsor area and the station&#x27;s Detroit area ratings were minimal.

The station&#x27;s studios changed a few times in the years. It was originally located in the Macabee&#x27;s Building next to the Wandalyn Viscount Hotel on Ouellette Avenue between Erie Street and Giles Boulevard. In late 1982, CJOM and CKNW moved to the Bob Pedler Building, located on Cabana Road East near Howard Avenue in the southern part of Windsor. Eventually, the station relocated to the former &quot;Big 8&quot; CKLW building, at the corner of Ouellette Avenue and Tecumseh Road West when CHUM Limited purchased the station.
===The Mix to 89X===
CJOM-FM became CIMX-FM in 1990. CIMX was first known as &quot;The Mix&quot; with an adult contemporary format, but disc jockey Greg St. James began playing modern rock on his evening show (8 to midnight) beginning in September 1990. This program was called &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; and was eventually hosted by four different DJs, Greg St. James, Darren Revell, Michelle Denomme and Mr. Vertical.

On May 13, 1991, the modern rock format went full-time and &quot;89X&quot; was born. The first (and ultimately, the last) song on &quot;89X&quot; was &quot;Stop!&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction. CIMX-FM immediately took away many listeners from other youth-oriented stations in Detroit, particularly WHYT and WDFX, and may have been at least partially responsible for WHYT&#x27;s decision to switch to an alternative format a few years later.

CIMX had been owned by Canada&#x27;s CHUM Limited since the late 1980s, but was sold along with the rest of CHUM&#x27;s radio stations to CTVglobemedia in 2007. Its sister station, CIDR-FM, adopted an adult album alternative format in 2006, thus forcing CIMX to add more active rock songs to its playlist and go up against WRIF. Throughout the 2000s, the format has moved between alternative rock and active rock, with the station playing more metal rock than might be found on other alternative stations.

In the February 29, 2012, issue of &quot;Real Detroit Weekly&quot;, 89X was rated the best radio station in Detroit. &quot;Real Detroit Weekly&quot; also crowned 89X&#x27;s own Jay Hudson the best DJ in Detroit for the fourth consecutive year.

On March 30, 2017, Bell Media announced that it would close its US-based sales office in Bingham Farms, canceled CIMX&#x27;s morning show &quot;Cal &amp; Co.&quot;, and laid off around a dozen people as part of a restructuring of its Windsor cluster. After the changes, CIMX began to once again experience more of an active rock lean. On April 3, 2017, CIMX debuted their new morning show &quot;The Morning X&quot;, hosted by long-time personality and music director Mark McKenzie.

===Pure Country 89===
On November 18, 2020, Bell announced on the 89X website that CIMX would adopt a new format the next day at noon; concurrently, the station&#x27;s on air staff was let go. At that time, CIMX flipped to country as &quot;Pure Country 89&quot;, launching with 10,000 songs in a row commercial free. In anticipation of the format change, Entercom flipped its Detroit station WDZH from soft adult contemporary to modern rock as &quot;Alt 98.7&quot; almost immediately afterward. The current format competes locally with CJWF-FM, as well as with Detroit&#x27;s WYCD. In other nearby markets, it competes with WWWW in Ann Arbor.

The station carries networked programming shared with other &quot;Pure Country&quot;-branded stations, including &quot;The Bobby Bones Show&quot;. Unlike the other Pure Country stations (which air it in the evening), CIMX also clears &quot;Bobby Bones&quot; in its normal timeslot in lieu of producing a local morning show.

==Live events==
In addition to the various annual shows, the station held many acoustic &quot;Live-X&quot; events when bands come to town. The acoustic renditions have even been used by many of the bands, including Soundgarden&#x27;s re-release of King Animal, &quot;King Animal Plus,&quot; when the band performed their song &quot;Halfway There.&quot;

89X celebrated its first birthday in May 1992 by holding two X-Fest shows. Peter Murphy, the Nymphs, Senseless Things were a few of the bands that played X-Fest. Then in 1993, 89X held a birthday show at Chene Park featuring the Tragically Hip. The next year, 1994, 89X started throwing annual &quot;Birthday Bash&quot; shows. The Birthday Bash in 1994 was held at the Phoenix Plaza Amphitheater during the World Cup competitions in Pontiac. The Afghan Whigs, Beck, and the Odds were some of the bands that played.

<doc id="704419" wikidata="Q24760" url="?curid=704419" title="Luna Sea">
<text>Luna Sea (stylized as LUNA SEA) is a Japanese rock band formed in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1986. Due to the use of makeup and costumes early in their career and their widespread popularity, they are considered one of the most successful and influential bands in the visual kei movement. Throughout the mid-1990s they used significantly less makeup, and after a one-year break in 1997, came back with a more mainstream alternative rock style and toned down their on-stage attire. They disbanded in 2000. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Luna Sea at number 90 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts.

Initially founded in 1986, by bassist J and rhythm guitarist Inoran while in high school, the band was originally called Lunacy. In 1989 they recruited lead guitarist Sugizo, drummer Shinya and vocalist Ryuichi, a lineup that has remained the same. They released a few demo tapes prior to renaming themselves Luna Sea and releasing their self-titled debut album in 1991. The band achieved their breakthrough success with a sold-out tour in 1991, which helped them get a contract with MCA Victor, and with the release of their second album &quot;Image&quot; (1992), which reached number nine on the Oricon music chart. Following the critically acclaimed albums &quot;Eden&quot; (1993), &quot;Mother&quot; (1994) and &quot;Style&quot; (1996), the band switched to Universal in 1998 and released their best-selling studio album, &quot;Shine&quot;. In late 2000, after their seventh studio album &quot;Lunacy&quot;, Luna Sea disbanded.

Luna Sea reunited for a one-off reunion concert in 2007 at the Tokyo Dome, and again in 2008 for the hide memorial summit. In 2010 the group officially reunited and held a world tour. Three years later they released their first new album in thirteen years, &quot;A Will&quot;. Their ninth album, &quot;Luv&quot;, followed four years later in 2017. At the end of 2019, their tenth album &quot;Cross,&quot; co-produced by Steve Lillywhite, became their first to top &quot;Billboard Japan&quot;.

==History==

===1986–1991: Formation and debut album===

High school friends, Jun &quot;J&quot; Onose and Kiyonobu &quot;Inoran&quot; Inoue founded a band called Lunacy in 1986. Three years later, on January 16, 1989, they recruited drummer Shinya Yamada from the band Pinoccio, who insisted that his bandmate Yasuhiro &quot;Sugizo&quot; Sugihara also join. As J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo switched from bass guitar to lead guitarist. They played a single concert before firing their vocalist for a lack of talent. Ryuichi Kawamura (then called &quot;Rayla&quot;) from the band Slaughter then joined on May 6, finalizing the group&#x27;s lineup. Lunacy debuted on stage at the 100-seat capacity Play House in Machida, Tokyo on May 29, 1989. They released their first demo tape, &quot;Lunacy&quot;, on August 9, with all one hundred copies sold out. In October, they transferred their activities to Meguro, where they performed at local venues such as Rock-May-Kan and Live Station. In December, the band&#x27;s second demo &quot;Shade&quot; was released, with all one thousand copies sold out, and on December 17 the band sold all 150 tickets for their first official one-man live concert at Machida Play House.

In 1990, Lunacy continued to play small venue concerts and for the first time outside Tokyo, in Osaka. They held their first anniversary concert at Machida Play House on June 10, where they distributed the free demo &quot;Lastly&quot;. Towards the end of the year, the band changed their name from Lunacy to Luna Sea. In early 1991, they were discovered by hide of X Japan and were signed by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki to his independent label Extasy Records. They then took part in the label&#x27;s Nuclear Fusion Tour in March with Gilles de Rais and Sighs of Love Potion. On the tour, a 3-track sample CD including a song from each band was freely distributed, to which they contributed a short sample of &quot;Precious&quot;. Their first album, the self-titled &quot;Luna Sea&quot;, was released the following month. They held larger live performances throughout the year with their first national tour titled Under the New Moon, which was separated into three legs or &quot;Episodes&quot;, with 45 performances, of which the final concerts attracted an audience of over one thousand. The tour gathered seventeen thousand people in total. On October 29, they performed at that year&#x27;s Extasy Summit concert, at the sold out Nippon Budokan.

===1992–1994: Breakthrough success; &quot;Eden&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot;===
In January 1992, the band&#x27;s official fan club Slave was launched. In March they held a small fan club tour and on May 20 performed their last indie concert, the third &quot;kurofuku gentei&quot; gig at Machida Play House. On May 21, Luna Sea released their first major studio album, &quot;Image&quot;, on MCA Victor. The album peaked at number 9, spending 14 weeks on the Oricon charts. It was followed by the band&#x27;s debut tour Image or Real in May, and corresponding with their increasing popularity, continued with After the Image tour in September. There were 25 concerts with an audience of more than twenty-eight thousand people. On October 31, they performed at another Extasy Summit at the Nippon Budokan.
Luna Sea&#x27;s first single, &quot;Believe&quot;, was released in February. The single peaked at number 11, spending 7 weeks on the charts. The band started working on their second album and began touring throughout the country for it on April 16, with the Search for My Eden tour. The tour included 14 concerts in the same number of locations, and mobilized an audience of around twenty-six thousand people. The album &quot;Eden&quot; was released on April 21, and peaked at number 5, spending 19 weeks on the charts. It was certified gold, for shipment of over two hundred thousand copies, by the RIAJ. In July they released their second single &quot;In My Dream (With Shiver)&quot;, which peaked at number 9 and spent 4 weeks on the charts. In August, the four concert Search for My Eden Encore tour was held, of which the latter two shows on August 26 and 27 were planned for the Nippon Budokan. However, the last concert was postponed until August 30 because of the Category 4 Super Typhoon Yancy. In December the &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; video compilation was released, which included performances from smaller venues during the year, and the band started the Garden of Sinners 93-94 tour, with 20 concerts that mobilized forty thousand people. At the end of the year, the band received the &quot;Grand Prix New Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 7th Japan Gold Disc Awards.

On February 12, 1994, the band performed the tour&#x27;s final concert at the sold-out 17,000 seat Yokohama Arena. On July 21, their third single &quot;Rosier&quot; was released. It peaked at number 3, spent 25 weeks on the charts, and was certified gold by the RIAJ. In December, the single&#x27;s promotional video was awarded the &quot;Best Promotional Video&quot; at the 36th Japan Record Awards. Between August 9 and 30, the band went on a sold-out five-stop tour with Soft Ballet and Buck-Tick titled LSB. It is now looked at as a legendary tour in Japanese rock, not only due to the three headlining acts coming together, but because the then up-and-coming guest acts, The Yellow Monkey, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, The Mad Capsule Markets and Die in Cries, all went on to achieve success. On September 21, Luna Sea released their fourth single &quot;True Blue&quot;, which topped the charts, and was certified platinum for selling over four hundred thousand copies. Responding to the popularity, the band released their third album &quot;Mother&quot; on October 26. It peaked at number 2, spent 30 weeks on the charts, and eventually sold more than half a million copies. In December they performed at the Osaka-jō Hall, and three times, of which two were consecutive, at the Nippon Budokan.

===1995–1996: First live at the Tokyo Dome, &quot;Style&quot;===
In January, the band members went to Ireland to film the promotional video for their fifth single, &quot;Mother&quot;. The single was released the following month, peaked at number 5, spending 8 weeks on the charts, and was certified gold by the RIAJ. Throughout March and May, the band held the Mother of Love, Mother of Hate tour, which included 31 concert in twenty-seven locations and an audience of sixty-three thousand people. On May 24, Luna Sea released their first promotional video collection, &quot;Eclipse I&quot;. On November 13, the band&#x27;s sixth single &quot;Desire&quot; was released. It topped the charts, spending 14 weeks on them, and sold more than half a million copies, being certified platinum by the RIAJ. By now, the band&#x27;s popularity had reached the point to which they would headline Japan&#x27;s largest indoor live venue, the Tokyo Dome. On December 23, they held a concert titled Lunatic Tokyo there, tickets sold out the same day they went on sale, which was filmed for a home video release the following year.

In March 1996, &quot;End of Sorrow&quot;, their seventh single, topped the charts, spent 8 weeks on them, and was certified platinum by the RIAJ. It was followed on April 22, by the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Style&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s first album to top the charts, spending 21 weeks on them, sold more than half a million records by the end of the year, being certified platinum, and was the thirtieth best-selling album of 1996. In July, the single &quot;In Silence&quot; was released and peaked at number 2, spending 9 weeks on the charts, and was certified gold. Also in July, the band went on the sold-out Un Ending Style tour, which opened with two consecutive concerts at Yokohama Arena and continued for 16 concerts in nine locations, and mobilized an audience of over one hundred thousand people. It was continued in October with the Encore - To Rise tour, 28 concerts in smaller venues, and ended with a Christmas concert on December 23, titled , at the outdoor Yokohama Stadium. During the concert it was announced that the band would have a temporary year break in 1997 for each member to pursue solo careers.

===1997–2000: Commercial peak; &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Lunacy&quot;, disbandment===
In 1997, Luna Sea switched record companies, as MCA Records was renamed to Universal. The band&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Singles&quot; was released on December 17. The album topped the charts, sold over a million copies in the first three weeks, spent 27 weeks on the charts, and was the twentieth best-selling album of 1998. It was also one of the albums to receive the &quot;Best Rock Album of the Year&quot; award at the 12th Japan Gold Disc Awards. On the same day, the band resumed their activities with a concert at Akasaka Blitz and unveiled a toned-down visual image.
In April 1998, the band&#x27;s ninth and best-selling single, &quot;Storm&quot;, was released. It topped the charts with sales of over three hundred thousand copies, becoming the band&#x27;s second single to sell more than half a million units, and spent 10 weeks on the charts. It was the twenty-ninth best-selling single of 1998, and was certified platinum by the RIAJ. In June and July, two more singles followed, &quot;Shine&quot;, which topped the charts, and &quot;I for You&quot;, which peaked at number 2 and spent 16 weeks on the charts. Both singles were certified platinum. &quot;I for You&quot; was the theme song of the very popular Japanese drama &quot;Kamisama mō Sukoshi dake&quot;. On July 23, &quot;Shine&quot;, the band&#x27;s sixth and best-selling studio album, was released. It topped the charts, spent 13 weeks on them, and was certified million. It, like &quot;Singles&quot;, was awarded &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; at the 13th Japan Gold Disc Awards. The song &quot;Breathe&quot; from this album was also used in the Japanese release of Walt Disney&#x27;s animated movie &quot;Mulan&quot;. In August, the band held two consecutive concerts at Yokohama Stadium, titled , followed in September by, at the time, the band&#x27;s longest tour, Shining Brightly, which included 33 concerts in twenty-six locations and mobilized one hundred and fifty thousand people. Two consecutive sold out concerts, titled End of Period, were held at the Tokyo Dome on December 23 and 24.

In 1999, Luna Sea&#x27;s popularity reached overseas to neighboring countries in Asia, and they went on their first Asian tour in January, visiting Taipei, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the band, their first live compilation album &quot;Never Sold Out&quot; was released in May, which peaked at number 5, and was certified gold. They then planned an open-air concert in Tokyo, with a stage costing 10 million dollars US. On May 27, two days before the planned concert, a typhoon destroyed the elaborate set. However, at the suggestion of Sugizo, the debris was used as a backdrop. The 10th Anniversary Gig [Never Sold] Out Capacity ∞ was held on May 30, and was attended by approximately 100,000 people, an attendance record in Japan at the time. On December 23, a sold-out joint live by Luna Sea and Glay, titled The Millennium Eve, was held at the Tokyo Dome.

On January 29, 2000, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Sweetest Coma Again&quot; was included in the Japanese release of the original soundtrack to, the James Bond film, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Their first release in almost two years, the single &quot;Gravity&quot; was released in March and topped the charts, being certified gold. In June the single &quot;Tonight&quot; was released, peaked at number 4, and was also certified gold. Following the singles, on June 23 the concert titled Premiere of &quot;Lunacy&quot; 2000 was held at the Nippon Budokan to promote the band&#x27;s upcoming album. At the show they only played songs from their upcoming seventh studio album. The album, &quot;Lunacy&quot;, was released on July 12, and while it was not as successful as their previous efforts, spending only 6 weeks on the charts, it peaked at number 3 and was certified gold by the RIAJ. It was supported by two sold out nationwide tours in July and October, titled Brand New Chaos, with 32 concerts in sixteen locations and an extended two shows in Hong Kong and Taipei. The tour garnered 350,000 people. On November 8, they released their fourteenth and last single, &quot;Love Song&quot;, which peaked at number 4. That same day the band held an emergency press conference in Hong Kong, where they announced they would &quot;drop the curtain&quot; after two shows at the Tokyo Dome. The compilation album &quot;Period -the Best Selection-&quot;, which topped the charts and was certified platinum by the RIAJ, was released on December 23. On December 26 and 27, Luna Sea performed their two consecutive sold out farewell concerts, The Final Act, at the Tokyo Dome. In March 2001, &quot;Billboard&quot; quoted music critic Hiromichi Ugaya as saying that Luna Sea broke up due to conflict between Ryuichi and the other members. Speaking of the last years of the band in 2008, Sugizo stated that the relationships and communication between members were strained due to egos. In 2014, after the band reunited, Inoran stated that at the time &quot;we promised to each other that we would all go out into the world while we were in our 30s, absorb things and regroup.&quot;

===2007–2011: Reunion concerts and World Tour Reboot===
Nearly seven years after disbanding, Luna Sea reunited for the God Bless You ~One Night Dejavu~ concert on December 24, 2007, at the Tokyo Dome. Tickets for the show sold out within five minutes, and the concert was broadcast live on Japan&#x27;s NHK BS Hi-vision Satellite channel. A tribute album to the band, &quot;Luna Sea Memorial Cover Album -Re:birth-&quot;, was previously released on December 19, 2007. It features covers of their songs performed by artists that were either influenced by Luna Sea or artists that the band&#x27;s members respect, such as Nami Tamaki, Masami Tsuchiya, High and Mighty Color, Mucc, and Merry. Less than a year later, Luna Sea reunited again to perform at the hide memorial summit on May 4, 2008, at Ajinomoto Stadium. On May 29, 2009, the band&#x27;s music catalog was released on iTunes.
On August 25, 2010, it was announced that Luna Sea would hold a press conference on August 31 in Hong Kong, where they previously announced the end of their activities ten years earlier. At the press conference, the band officially announced their reunion. Their first concert tour in ten years, the world tour named 20th Anniversary World Tour Reboot -to the New Moon-, was confirmed and the band also said they were in the process of writing new songs. Inoran later cited the success of their 2007 concert as a major reason for the regrouping. The tour began on November 27 in Germany and continued on to the United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and was planned to end with two shows in Japan on the 23 and 24 of December at the Tokyo Dome. A third show, a free concert titled , which referred to the three previous &quot;kurofuku gentei&quot; gigs held in their indie days, was held on December 15 with all songs performed being from pre-1995. The tour finished with two additional concerts at the World Memorial Hall in Kobe on December 30 and 31. Before the last shows, in December, they transferred record companies to Avex Group&#x27;s HPQ label.

A new re-recording of their debut album, &quot;Luna Sea&quot;, was released on March 16, 2011, as a self-cover. In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11 in Japan, the band released the digital download song &quot;Promise&quot; on April 9. It was their first new song in ten years and was released exclusively on Amazon websites, with all proceeds donated to the Japanese Red Cross to aid the victims. A live album and video of their US concert, both titled &quot;Luna Sea 3D in Los Angeles&quot;, was released in June, with the film being shown in Japanese theaters nationwide. On October 22, they held a charity concert titled A Promise to the Brave at Saitama Super Arena, and all proceeds from the event went to the Japanese Red Cross. Tickets for the show went on sale on August 14 and sold out in five minutes.

===2012–2015: &quot;A Will&quot; and 25th anniversary===
The band&#x27;s first physical single in over eleven years, &quot;The One -Crash to Create-&quot;, was released in March 2012. It contains only the title track, which is nearly twenty-three minutes long, peaked at number 5 and spent 7 weeks on the charts. It is also the band&#x27;s last release with Avex, and they returned to Universal Music in October. On Universal, Luna Sea released their sixteenth, and first double A-side, single &quot;The End of the Dream/Rouge&quot; on December 12.

A concert series titled Luna Sea Live 2012-2013 The End of the Dream was announced, with shows at Osaka-jō Hall on December 23 and the other six nights at the Nippon Budokan on January 11–13 and 18-20. It was their first concerts at both venues in 13 years. After the concerts sold out in one day of going on sale, the Zepp Tour 2012 was announced to take place before them, with all performances being at Zepp live houses. It started on November 16 in Osaka and went to Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sapporo, and ended in Tokyo on December 16, with each venue being played two to three consecutive nights each. The Zepp tour was also sold out. Additionally, in a sequel to the previous year&#x27;s charity performance at Saitama Super Arena, the band performed another at Sendai Sun Plaza on December 24.
Following the performances at the Budokan, another Asian tour started on January 26, 2013, with two shows in Taiwan, then moved to Hong Kong, Bangkok and ended on February 8 in Singapore. After the tour, Luna Sea also held an exclusive live performance for their official fan club members on February 17. Originally, NHK Hall was selected to hold the event, however, the band decided to change the location to Ryōgoku Kokugikan to serve excessive demands. The single &quot;Thoughts&quot; was released on August 28 in celebration of the band&#x27;s 24th anniversary, and is featured in a TV commercial for the online video game &quot;Master of Chaos&quot;. The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Ran&quot;, was released on November 13 and used as the theme song to the television drama &quot;Toshi Densetsu no Onna 2&quot;. Luna Sea performed at Fuji TV&#x27;s 2013 FNS Kayōsai festival, which was broadcast live on December 4. &quot;A Will&quot;, the group&#x27;s first new studio album in 13 years, became available on December 11, 2013.

2014 marks Luna Sea&#x27;s 25th anniversary, and they celebrated the occasion in several ways. The band performed a fan club-only show on May 26 at Akasaka Blitz, at which they performed &quot;A Will&quot; in full, and announced four more fan club-only &quot;kurofuku gentei&quot; concerts at the Diver City (June 21–22) and Osaka (August 23–24) Zepp music halls. They released both the remastered compilation album &quot;25th Anniversary Ultimate Best -The One-&quot; and the live compilation album &quot;Never Sold Out 2&quot; on May 28, and performed a special anniversary concert at Yoyogi National Stadium on May 29. Their first nationwide tour since reuniting, Luna Sea 25th Anniversary Live Tour The Lunatic -A Liberated Will-, took place from June 7 to September 14 before picking up again in January 2015 and ending on March 1. Additional performances at Saitama Super Arena and Yokohama Arena took place at the end of 2014, on December 21 and 23 respectively.

As an epilogue to their 25th anniversary, Luna Sea hosted a rock festival titled Lunatic Fest on June 27 and 28, 2015, with an estimated 60,000 fans attending. Held at Makuhari Messe, there were three stages and 12 artists, with the host band performing twice both nights; once as opening act Lunacy and again as Luna Sea. Other acts included Dead End, Dir En Grey, X Japan, Siam Shade and Tokyo Yankees the first night, and Aion, Buck-Tick, D&#x27;erlanger, and Glay the second night.

===2016–2022: &quot;Luv&quot;, 30th Anniversary and &quot;Cross&quot;===
The band provided the new song &quot;Limit&quot; to be used as the opening theme song for the &quot;Endride&quot; anime series. It was released as a single on June 22, 2016. They performed at Makuhari Messe on October 14 and 16 as part of the three-day Visual Japan Summit. On December 23 and 24, Luna Sea performed The Holy Night -Beyond the Limit- concerts at Saitama Super Arena. A limited single of a Christmas song titled &quot;Holy Knight&quot; was sold only at these concerts.

Luna Sea held a special concert at the Nippon Budokan on May 29, 2017, where Sugizo&#x27;s guitar was powered only by hydrogen fuel cells, making it the first concert in history to be powered as such. They then headlined at the Summer Sonic Shanghai 2017 festival on August 26. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Luv&quot; was released on December 20. The equipment of all five members was powered by hydrogen fuel cells for their December 23 and 24 concerts at the Saitama Super Arena. The eighteen-date Luv Tour -World Left Behind- was set to begin with two concerts on January 27 and 28, 2018 at Mori no Hall 21 in Chiba, but these two concerts were rescheduled to May 23 and 24 due to Sugizo having the flu. Instead the tour began on February 3. The band hosted another two-day Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe on June 23 and 24, 2018. Performers who were not at the 2015 festival include Glim Spanky, lynch., Maki Ohguro, and The Oral Cigarettes.

Beginning the celebration of their 30th anniversary early, Luna Sea held two concerts titled Lunatic X&#x27;Mas 2018 -Introduction to the 30th Anniversary- at Saitama Super Arena on December 22 and 23, 2018. The first was subtitled &quot;Image or Real&quot; after their 1992 tour of the same name, while the second was subtitled &quot;Search for My Eden&quot; after their 1993 tour of the same name; each night saw them perform songs they had not played since the original tours. The band&#x27;s eight major label studio albums from &quot;Image&quot; to &quot;Luv&quot; were released on vinyl record for the first time on May 29, 2019. That same day, a double A-side single titled &quot;Sora no Uta ~Higher and Higher~/Hisōbi&quot;, the first and second opening themes of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin - Advent of the Red Comet&quot; anime, was released. Luna Sea contributed a cover of TM Network&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Time ~Moebius no Sora o Koete~&quot; as the third opening theme of the anime. Anniversary concerts were held at the Nippon Budokan on May 31 and June 1, and in Hong Kong on June 7.

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Cross&quot;, was released on December 18, 2019. Co-produced by Steve Lillywhite, it marks the first time the band has worked with a record producer. It was their first album to top &quot;Billboard Japan&quot; Hot Albums chart. On December 21 and 22 the band performed two 30th anniversary Christmas concerts at Saitama Super Arena. From February 1 to May 31, 2020, Luna Sea was scheduled to have a nationwide 30th anniversary hall tour titled Cross the Universe with over 29 performances in 13 cities. However, all tour performances from the end of February on were postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. On April 28, 2020, the band released the digital song &quot;Make a Vow&quot;, which was produced remotely within two weeks as an answer to the pandemic. A day later, their twenty-first single &quot;The Beyond&quot; was released in limited production. It became their first song in over 20 years to top the Oricon Singles Chart.

Inspired by &quot;One World: Together at Home&quot;, Luna Sea designed and hosted &quot;Music Aid Fest. ~For Post Pandemic~&quot; on Fuji TV One on May 31 to support medical workers and others on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially a television music festival featuring live remotely recorded performances to elicit monetary donations, over 25 artists participated, including Ellegarden, Char, Koda Kumi, and 9mm Parabellum Bullet. Luna Sea were set to perform at Saitama Super Arena on December 26 and 27, 2020 as their first concerts since the pandemic forced them to postpone their 30th anniversary tour earlier in the year. They were to be the band&#x27;s first live streamed concerts with physical seats limited in capacity. However, both days were also postponed after Shinya tested positive for COVID-19 on the morning of December 26. These two shows, titled Reload, were finally held in 2021 on March 27 and 28. The seating was limited to 50% capacity or less and the shows featured a 20 minute break to allow ventilation in the arena. Following three days at the Tokyo Garden Theater from May 28–30, which were originally intended to be the Grand Final of the 30th anniversary tour, the rescheduled Cross the Universe tour began on June 12. The tour&#x27;s new Grand Final shows were held at Saitama Super Arena on January 8 and 9, 2022, but the regular tour actually ended on February 1. Ryuichi then underwent surgery to remove microvascular lesions in his vocal cords and Luna Sea began a &quot;recharging period&quot;.

===2022–present: 35th Anniversary===
Following Ryuichi&#x27;s successful rehabilitation, Luna Sea resumed activities with two concerts at the Nippon Budokan titled on August 26 and 27, 2022. Gachi Sea, a cover band formed by comedians Kamaitachi, Hiroki Nunokawa of Tom Brown, and Shinya Takagi of Joyman, with the addition of Luna Sea&#x27;s Shinya, performed during the encore of the first night. Two &quot;kurofuku gentei&quot; gigs took place on December 17 and 18 at Saitama Super Arena. Luna Sea played two nights at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza on May 27 and 28, 2023, which marked the first time in about three years that the audience could cheer aloud, as it was previously not allowed due to COVID-19 guidelines. On May 29, the band held a short free live for 150 members of their fanclub at Meguro Rock-May-Kan. On November 29, Luna Sea released self-cover re-recordings of their albums &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Style&quot; via Avex Trax. From October 7 to December 31, they held a dual arena tour of 10 concerts at five venues where they alternated recreating the setlists of those two albums&#x27; tours, the 1995 Mother of Love, Mother of Hate tour and the 1996 Un Ending Style tour, respectively.

Luna Sea held the largest nationwide tour of their career in 2024, to commemorate their 35th anniversary. Split into three episodes, the 41-date Era to Era tour saw the band continue to alternate setlists from their old tours, adding the 1992 Image or Real, 1993 Search for My Eden, 1998 Shining Brightly, and 2000 Brand New Chaos tours into the mix. Episode 1 took place between May 25 and July 14, Episode 2 between July 27 and September 1, while the final Episode 3 took place between September 14 and November 15 and included several &quot;kurofuku gentei&quot; gigs performed under the Lunacy name. Additionally, a Memorial Talk &amp; Unplugged Session for members of their fanclub was held at Culttz Kawasaki in their home prefecture on May 29, 2024. On February 22, 2025, Luna Sea reunited with Glay for The Millennium Eve 2025 joint concert at the Tokyo Dome, 25 years after the original. The following day saw the band&#x27;s 35th anniversary tour end with their first solo Tokyo Dome concert in 14 years, Lunatic Tokyo 2025. They will hold the third Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe on November 8 and 9.

==Musical style and influence==

Luna Sea formed at the end of the 1980s, when American and British glam metal were gradually losing popularity to alternative rock and grunge at the beginning of the 1990s. However, Japan&#x27;s original rock groups were late following the Western trend, and as such Luna Sea formed when bands of the visual kei movement, Japan&#x27;s answer to glam, were finally being recognized and achieving mainstream success. In the early 1990s, while still an indie band, the group&#x27;s musical style was punk rock with gothic and even some hardcore punk tendencies. Gota Nishidera recalled that the public&#x27;s image of Luna Sea in the mid-1990s was, &quot;A band that wears all-black, makeup, and repeatedly produced melodic killer tunes with fast beats.&quot; He opined that the biggest difference between Luna Sea and their contemporaries was their rhythm section of Shinya, J, and Inoran, and their exquisite control and ability to freely manipulate silence and explosion. Nishidera described Inoran as specializing in rhythmic aspects such as arpeggios, riffs, and cutting, and Sugizo as being in charge of the world view including the guitar solos. According to Alexey Eremenko of Allmusic, Luna Sea&#x27;s sound is &quot;firmly based in &#x27;80s hard rock, with a versatile progressive approach to songwriting, and its softer side, displayed later on in the group&#x27;s career, proved equally strong.&quot; HMV Japan wrote that their appeal lies not only in their unparalleled good looks, but also in the individuality of each band member. The members&#x27; individual music backgrounds influenced the band&#x27;s style; as children, Sugizo and Shinya mastered the violin and the traditional taiko drums respectively. They also preferred different genres of music, as Ryuichi and Shinya had a tendency for pop, while Inoran, J and Sugizo loved heavier rock. Sugizo liked England&#x27;s indie music culture, while J preferred the American rock scene. As for native Japanese bands, Dead End had particular influence on the group in the beginning, with Ryuichi being vocally and visually inspired by their frontman Morrie. Luna Sea and X Japan, despite their different musical styles, have had a close professional and personal relationship since the early 1990s.
Luna Sea&#x27;s musical catalog encompasses songs in a diverse range of musical styles, including punk and post-punk (e.g. &quot;Precious...&quot;, &quot;Déjàvu&quot;, &quot;Jesus&quot;), gothic rock (e.g. &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Lastly&quot;), hard rock (e.g. &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot;), alternative rock (e.g. &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;), progressive rock (e.g. &quot;Genesis of Mind ~Yume no Kanata e~&quot;, &quot;1999&quot;) and ballads (e.g. &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Love Song&quot;). Some of the band&#x27;s songs also feature the violin, played by Sugizo (e.g. &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;). They also wrote longer tracks, such as the nine and ten-minute long ballads &quot;Forever &amp; Ever&quot; and &quot;Virgin Mary&quot;, and the twenty-three-minute &quot;The One -Crash to Create-&quot;. The majority of the band&#x27;s lyrics are in Japanese, but usually all songs include some English words or lines. While all lyrics and songwriting has been credited to Luna Sea as a whole since 1993, over the years the member who originally composed specific songs have been revealed by the band or otherwise learned. It is often believed that the lyrics are almost exclusively written by Ryuichi, whose music contributions are limited to &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot;, &quot;Lost World&quot; and &quot;Anagram&quot;. However, Inoran stated that this is not the case, as each member writes lyrics. For example, he said he writes the lyrics to his own songs. The majority of songs are originally composed by Inoran, J or Sugizo, with Shinya&#x27;s only compositions being &quot;Inside You&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Millennium&quot;, the last written with Sugizo. When asked if there was a message in their songs, Sugizo stated that there is no reason for Luna Sea to give a political message, only to create music that will stimulate the imagination and act as &quot;a catalyst for realistic feedback.&quot; He also stated that his own guitar sound developed from trying to get the &quot;psychedelic feel of shoegaze bands&quot; in songs such as &quot;Wish&quot;, &quot;Rosier&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;. In Luna Sea, he personally attempts to &quot;express all that psychedelica, house and drug culture in a rock, guitar-band format.&quot; When writing material, all the band members live together temporarily before they enter the studio to record. Up until 2019&#x27;s &quot;Cross&quot;, they produced all of their music themselves, never working with a record producer.

Nishidera wrote that Luna Sea created a &quot;rhythm revolution&quot; in Japanese rock that brought about a major change in Japanese music and led to teenage boys and girls picking up musical instruments across the country. Additionally, he suggested that, while there had been earlier instances of signature model instruments for specific musicians becoming popular, Luna Sea are the only example where the signature model of each band member has sustained popularity. HMV Japan called Luna Sea pioneers of visual kei, and wrote that they influenced many newer bands in the scene. Eremenko wrote that they &quot;had an impact on literally hundreds of bands that followed in their wake in the next decade.&quot; Acts that cite them as an influence or look up to them include Miyavi, Mucc, D, Rottengraffty vocalists Nobuya and Naoki, Shinno of Nogod, members of Alice Nine, Tōru Kawauchi of 12012, Kei and Denka from Dio – Distraught Overlord, Aki of Sid, Makoto of Lucifer, Kazuno, Touya and Ruka of Charlotte, Silver Ash leader Ling, Hazuki of Lynch., Dazzle Vision&#x27;s Takuro, Kai from Esprit D&#x27;Air, several members of Nightmare, Akiya from Kagrra, and all five members of The Gazette. DuelJewel members Hayato and Yuya cited Luna Sea as the reason they entered the visual kei scene. Kra drummer Yasuno has said that he started playing drums because of Shinya, and their former guitarist Mai is also a fan of both Sugizo and Inoran. Back Number bassist Kazuya Kojima started playing bass because of J. The members of Versailles named Luna Sea and X Japan as influences, with singer Kamijo saying &quot;I think there isn&#x27;t anyone in the Japanese music business who hasn&#x27;t been influenced by them.&quot; Likewise, Leda of Galneryus and Deluhi claims he was not even interested in music until a friend played him Luna Sea and X Japan.

<text>Stolen Summer is a 2002 American drama film about a Catholic boy who befriends a terminally ill Jewish boy and tries to convert him, believing that it is the only way the Jewish boy will get to Heaven. Directed by first time writer/director Pete Jones, &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; is the first film produced for &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;, an independent film competition created by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and sponsored by HBO. &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; aired on HBO as a documentary series chronicling the selection of Jones&#x27;s script from approximately seven thousand entries, and the production of the film in Chicago in 2001.

The film&#x27;s casting department considered the casting of the Jewish Adi Stein as the Catholic Pete O&#x27;Malley, an ironic joke due to the characters attempting to convert a Jewish boy to Catholicism.

<text>The N1 (from , &quot;Carrier Rocket&quot;; Cyrillic: [[En (Cyrillic)|Н]]1) was a super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to deliver payloads beyond low Earth orbit. The N1 was the Soviet counterpart to the US Saturn V and was intended to enable crewed travel to the Moon and beyond, with studies beginning as early as 1959. Its first stage, Block A, was the most powerful rocket stage ever flown for over 50 years, with the record standing until Starship&#x27;s first integrated flight test. However, each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed in flight, with the second attempt resulting in the vehicle crashing back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff. Adverse characteristics of the large cluster of thirty engines and its complex fuel and oxidizer feeder systems were not revealed earlier in development because static test firings had not been conducted.

The N1-L3 version was designed to compete with the United States Apollo program to land a person on the Moon, using a similar lunar orbit rendezvous method. The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which were to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts. The L3 contained one stage for trans-lunar injection; another stage used for mid-course corrections, lunar orbit insertion, and the first part of the descent to the lunar surface; a single-pilot LK Lander spacecraft; and a two-pilot Soyuz 7K-LOK lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth.

The N1 started development in October 1965, almost four years after the Saturn V, during which it was underfunded and rushed. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer Sergei Korolev in 1966; the program was suspended in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. All details of the Soviet crewed lunar programs were kept secret until the USSR was nearing collapse in 1989.

==History==

In 1967 the United States and the Soviet Union were in a race to be first to land a human on the Moon. The N1/L3 program received formal approval in 1964, which required development of the N1 launch vehicle, comparable in size to the American Saturn V.

On 25 November 1967, less than three weeks after the first Saturn V flight during the Apollo 4 mission, the Soviets rolled out an N1 mockup to the newly constructed launch pad 110R at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Kazakhstan. This Facilities Systems Logistic Test and Training Vehicle, designated 1M1, was designed to give engineers valuable experience in the rollout, launch pad integration, and rollback activities, similar to the Saturn V Facilities Integration Vehicle SA-500F testing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in mid-1966. While the crawler transported the Saturn V to the pad vertically, the N1 made the trip horizontally and was then raised to the vertical position at the pad – a standard practice in the Soviet space program. On December 11, after completion of various tests, the N1 rocket was lowered and rolled back to the assembly building. The 1M1 mockup was used repeatedly in the following years for additional launchpad integration tests. 

Although this test was carried out in secret, a US reconnaissance satellite photographed the N1 on the pad shortly before its rollback to the assembly building. NASA Administrator James Webb had access to this and other similar intelligence that showed that the Russians were seriously planning crewed lunar missions. That knowledge influenced several key US decisions in the coming months. The satellite imagery appeared to show the USSR was close to a flight test of the N1, but did not reveal that this particular rocket was just a mockup and that the USSR was many months behind the US in the race to land a human on the Moon (though, at the very least, the CIA, the NRO, and President Lyndon Johnson &quot;did&quot; know that the rocket was a mockup per the daily presidential briefing of 27 December 1967). The Soviets were hopeful that they could carry out a test flight of the N1 in the first half of 1968, but for a variety of technical reasons the attempt did not occur for more than a year.

===Early Soviet lunar concepts===

In May 1961, the US announced the goal of landing a man on the Moon by 1970. During the same month, the report &quot;On Reconsideration of the Plans for Space Vehicles in the Direction of Defense Purposes&quot; set the first test launch of the N1 rocket for 1965. In June, Korolev was given a small amount of funding to start N1 development between 1961 and 1963. At the same time, Korolev proposed a lunar mission based on the new Soyuz spacecraft using an Earth orbit rendezvous profile. Several Soyuz rocket launches would be used to build up a complete Moon mission package, including one for the Soyuz spacecraft, another for the lunar lander, and a few with cislunar engines and fuel. This approach, driven by the limited capacity of the Soyuz rocket, meant that a rapid launch rate would be required to assemble the complex before any of the components ran out of consumables on-orbit. Korolev subsequently proposed that the N1 be enlarged to allow a single-launch lunar mission. In November–December 1961, Korolev and others tried to further argue that a super heavy lift rocket could deliver ultra heavy nuclear weapons, such as the just tested Tsar Bomba, or many warheads (up to 17) as further justification for the N1 design. Korolev was not inclined to use the rocket for military uses, but wanted to fulfill his space ambitions and saw military support as vital. The military response was lukewarm – they thought the N1 had little military usefulness and was worried it would divert funds away from pure military programs. Korolev&#x27;s correspondence with military leaders continued until February 1962 with little progress.

Meanwhile, Chelomey&#x27;s OKB-52 proposed an alternate mission with much lower risk. Instead of a crewed landing, Chelomei proposed a series of circumlunar missions to beat the US to the vicinity of the Moon. He also proposed a new booster for the mission, clustering four of his existing UR-200s (known as the SS-10 in the west) to produce a single larger booster, the UR-500. These plans were dropped when Glushko offered Chelomei the RD-270, which allowed the construction of the UR-500 in a much simpler &quot;monoblock&quot; design. He also proposed adapting an existing spacecraft design for the circumlunar mission, the single-cosmonaut LK-1. Chelomei felt that improvements in early UR-500/LK-1 missions would allow the spacecraft to be adapted for two cosmonauts.

The Strategic Missile Forces of the Soviet military were reluctant to support a politically motivated project with little military utility, but both Korolev and Chelomei pushed for a lunar mission. Between 1961 and 1964, Chelomei&#x27;s less aggressive proposal was accepted, and development of his UR-500 and the LK-1 were given a relatively high priority.

===Lunar N1 development starts===
Valentin Glushko, who then held a near-monopoly on rocket engine design in the Soviet Union, proposed the RD-270 engine using unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) propellants to power the newly enlarged N1 design. These hypergolic propellants ignite on contact, reducing the complexity of the engine, and were widely used in Glushko&#x27;s existing engines on various ICBMs. The full flow staged combustion cycle RD-270 was in testing before program cancellation, achieving a higher specific impulse than the gas-generator cycle Rocketdyne F-1 despite the use of UDMH/N2O4 propellants with lower potential impulse. The F-1 engine was five years into its development at the time and still experiencing combustion stability problems. Rocketdyne eventually solved the F-1 instability problems by adding copper dividers as baffles, but the RD-270 still had unsolved instability problems when the N1 program was cancelled in 1974, long after the F-1 problems were solved.

Glushko pointed out that the US Titan II GLV had successfully flown crew with similar hypergolic propellants. Korolev felt that the toxic nature of the fuels and their exhaust presented a safety risk for crewed space flight, and that kerosene/LOX was a better solution. The disagreement between Korolev and Glushko over the question of fuels ultimately became a major issue that hampered progress.

Personal issues between the two played a role, with Korolev holding Glushko responsible for his incarceration at the Kolyma Gulag in the 1930s and Glushko considering Korolev to be cavalier and autocratic towards things outside his competence. The difference of opinions led to a falling out between Korolev and Glushko. In 1962, a committee was appointed to resolve the dispute and agreed with Korolev. Glushko refused outright to work on LOX/kerosene engines, and with Korolev in general. Korolev eventually gave up and decided to enlist the help of Nikolai Kuznetsov, the OKB-276 jet engine designer, while Glushko teamed up with other rocket designers to build the very successful Proton, Zenit, and later Energia rockets.

Kuznetsov, who had limited experience in rocket design, responded with the NK-15, a fairly small engine that would be delivered in several versions tuned to different altitudes. To achieve the required amount of thrust, it was proposed that 30 NK-15s would be used in a clustered configuration. An outer ring of 24 engines and an inner ring of six engines would be separated by an air gap, with airflow supplied via inlets near the top of the booster. The air would be mixed with the exhaust in order to provide some degree of thrust augmentation, as well as engine cooling. The arrangement of 30 rocket engine nozzles on the N1&#x27;s first stage could have been an attempt at creating a crude version of a toroidal aerospike engine system; more conventional aerospike engines were also studied.

===N1-L3 lunar complex===

Korolev proposed a larger N1 combined with the new L3 lunar package based on the Soyuz 7K-L3. The L3 combined rocket stages, the modified Soyuz, and the new LK lunar lander were to be launched by a single N1 to conduct a lunar landing. Chelomei responded with a clustered UR-500-derived vehicle, topped with the LK-1 spacecraft already under development, and a lander developed by his design bureau. Korolev&#x27;s proposal was selected as the winner in August 1964, but Chelomei was told to continue with his circumlunar UR-500/LK-1 work.

When Khrushchev was overthrown later in 1964, infighting between the two teams started anew. In October 1965, the Soviet government ordered a compromise; the circumlunar mission would be launched on Chelomei&#x27;s UR-500 using Korolev&#x27;s Soyuz spacecraft Soyuz 7K-L1, aka Zond (literally &quot;probe&quot;), aiming for a launch in 1967, the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Korolev, meanwhile, would continue with his original N1-L3 proposal. Korolev had clearly won the argument, but work on the LK-1 continued anyway, as well as the Zond.

Korolev lobbied in 1964 for a crewed circumlunar mission, which was at first rejected, but was passed with the 3 August 1964 Central Committee resolution titled &quot;On work involving the study of the Moon and outer space&quot;, with the objective of landing a cosmonaut on the Moon in 1967 or &#x27;68.

In January 1966, Korolev died due to complications of surgery to remove intestinal polyps that also discovered a large tumor. His work on N1-L3 was taken over by his deputy, Vasily Mishin, who did not have Korolev&#x27;s political astuteness or influence, and was reputed to be a heavy drinker. After a few years of setbacks and four failed launches, in May 1974 Mishin was fired and replaced by Glushko, who immediately ordered the cancellation of the N1 programme and the crewed lunar mission in general, despite Mishin&#x27;s assertion that the rocket will be fully operational in under two years. 

===N1 vehicle serial numbers===

* N1 1L – full scale dynamic test model, each stage was individually dynamically tested; the full N1 stack was only tested at 1/4 scale.
* N1 2L (1M1) – Facilities Systems Logistic Test and Training Vehicle (FSLT &amp; TV); two first stages painted gray, third stage gray-white and L3 white.
* N1 3L – first launch, engine fire, exploded at 12 km.
* N1 4L – Block A LOX tank developed cracks; never launched, parts from Block A used for other launchers; rest of airframe structure scrapped.
* N1 5L – second launch, partially painted gray; first night launch, launch failure demolished pad 110 East.
* N1 6L – third launch, flown from the second pad 110 West, deficient roll control, destroyed after 51s.
* N1 7L – fourth launch, all white, engine cutoff at caused propellant line hammering, rupturing the fuel system.
* N1 8L and 9L – flight ready N1Fs with improved NK-33 engines in Block A, scrapped when the program was canceled.
* N1 10L – uncompleted, scrapped along with 8L and 9L.

===N1F===
Mishin continued with the N1F project after the cancellation of plans for a crewed Moon landing in the hope that the booster would be used to build the Zvezda moonbase. The program was terminated in 1974 when Mishin was replaced by Glushko. Two N1Fs were being readied for launch at the time, but these plans were canceled.

The two flight-ready N1Fs were scrapped and their remains could still be found around Baikonur years later used as shelters and storage sheds. The boosters were deliberately broken up in an effort to cover up the USSR&#x27;s failed Moon attempts, which was publicly stated to be a paper project in order to fool the US into thinking there was a race going on. This cover story lasted until &quot;glasnost&quot;, when the remaining hardware was seen publicly on display.

===Aftermath and engines===
The program was followed by the &quot;Vulkan&quot; concept for a huge launch vehicle using Syntin/LOX propellants, later replaced by LH2/LOX on the 2nd and 3rd stages. &quot;Vulkan&quot; was superseded by the Energia/Buran program in 1976.

About 150 of the upgraded engines for the N1F escaped destruction. Although the rocket as a whole was unreliable, the NK-33 and NK-43 engines are rugged and reliable when used as a standalone unit. In the mid-1990s, Russia sold 36 engines for $1.1 million each and a license for the production of new engines to the US company Aerojet General.

The US company Kistler Aerospace worked on incorporating these engines into a new rocket design with the intention of offering commercial launch services, but the company eventually went into bankruptcy before seeing a single launch. Aerojet also modified the NK-33 to incorporate thrust vector control capability for Orbital Science&#x27;s Antares launch vehicle. Antares used two of these modified AJ-26 engines for first stage propulsion. The first four launches of the Antares were successful, but on the fifth launch the rocket exploded shortly after launch. Preliminary failure analysis by Orbital pointed to a possible turbopump failure in one NK-33/AJ-26. Given Aerojet&#x27;s previous problems with the NK-33/AJ-26 engine during the modification and test program (two engine failures in static test firings, one of which caused major damage to the test stand) and the later in-flight failure, Orbital decided that the NK-33/AJ-26 was not reliable enough for future use.

In Russia, N1 engines were not used again until 2004, when the remaining 70 or so engines were incorporated into a new rocket design, the Soyuz 3. , the project was frozen due to the lack of funding. Instead, the NK-33 was incorporated into the first stage of a light variant of the Soyuz rocket, which was first launched on 28 December 2013.

==Description==
The N1 stood tall with its L3 payload. The N1-L3 consisted of five stages in total: the first three (N1) for insertion into a low Earth parking orbit, and another two (L3) for translunar injection and lunar orbit insertion. Fully loaded and fueled, the N1-L3 weighed . The lower three stages were shaped to produce a single frustum wide at the base, while the L3 section was mostly cylindrical, carried inside a shroud an estimated wide. The conical shaping of the lower stages was due to the arrangement of the tanks within, a smaller spherical kerosene tank on top of the larger liquid oxygen tank below.

During the N1&#x27;s lifetime, a series of improved engines was introduced to replace those used in the original design. The resulting modified N1 was known as the N1F, but did not fly before the project&#x27;s cancellation.

===Block A first stage===
The first stage, Block A, was powered by 30 NK-15 engines arranged in two rings, the main ring of 24 at the outer edge of the booster and the core propulsion system consisting of the inner 6 engines at about half diameter. The control system was primarily based on differential throttling of the engines of the outer ring for pitch and yaw. The core propulsion system was not used for control. The Block A also included four grid fins, which were later used on Soviet air-to-air missile designs. 

In total, the Block A produced of thrust, the most powerful rocket stage flown to date. This exceeded the thrust of the Saturn V, and the record would stand for over half a century, until the SpaceX Super Heavy surpassed it in 2023.

====Engine control system====
The KORD (Russian acronym for literally &quot;Control (of) Rocket Engines&quot;) was the automatic engine control system devised to throttle, shut down and monitor the large cluster of 30 engines in Block A (the first stage). The KORD system controlled the differential thrusting of the outer ring of 24 engines for pitch and yaw attitude control by throttling them appropriately and it also shut down malfunctioning engines situated opposite each other. This was to negate the pitch or yaw moment diametrically opposing engines in the outer ring would generate, thus maintaining symmetrical thrust. Block A could perform nominally with two pairs of opposing engines shut down (26/30 engines). Unfortunately the KORD system was unable to react to rapidly occurring processes such as the exploding turbo-pump during the second launch.

Due to the deficiencies of the KORD system, a new computer system was developed for the fourth and last launch. The &quot;S-530&quot; was the first Soviet digital guidance and control system, and unlike the KORD, which was essentially just an analogue engine control system, the S-530 supervised all control tasks in the launch vehicle and spacecraft, of which the N1 carried two, one located in the Block V third stage that controlled the engines for the first three stages. The second S-530 was located in the Soyuz LOK command module and provided control for the rest of the mission from TLI to lunar flyby and return to Earth.

===Block B second stage===
The second stage, Block B, was powered by 8 NK-15V engines arranged in a single ring. The only major difference between the NK-15 and -15V was the engine bell and various tunings for air-start and high-altitude performance. The N1F Block B replaced the NK-15 engines with upgraded NK-43 engines.

Block B could withstand the shutdown of one pair of opposing engines (6/8 engines).

===Block V third stage===
The upper stage, Block V (В/&quot;V&quot; being the third letter in the Russian alphabet), mounted four smaller NK-21 engines in a square. The N1F Block V replaced the NK-21 engines with NK-31 engines.

Block V could function with one engine shut down and three functioning correctly.

=== Assembly, transport, erection, on-pad-servicing ===
The N-1 was assembled horizontally, then moved on a transporter to the launch pad, and erected. There was a service tower/gantry at the pad with umbilical connections for liquid fuelling.

===Development problems===
The complex plumbing needed to feed fuel and oxidizer into the clustered arrangement of rocket engines was fragile and a major factor in 2 of the 4 launch failures. Unlike Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, the N1&#x27;s Baikonur Cosmodrome could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all of the stages had to be shipped in pieces and assembled at the launch site. This led to difficulties in testing that contributed to the N1&#x27;s lack of success.

The NK-15 engines had a number of valves that were activated by pyrotechnics rather than hydraulic or mechanical means, this being a weight-saving measure. Once shut, the valves could not be re-opened. This meant that the engines for Block A were only test-fired individually and the entire cluster of 30 engines was never static test fired as a unit. Sergei Khrushchev stated that only two out of every batch of six engines were tested, and not the units actually intended for use in the booster. As a result, the complex and destructive vibrational modes (which ripped apart propellant lines and turbines), as well as exhaust plume and fluid dynamic problems (causing vehicle roll, vacuum cavitation, and other problems), in Block A were not discovered and worked out before flight. Blocks B and V were static test fired as complete units.

While trying to find ways for more performance, research was conducted on the feasibility of using an aerospike engine in the first stage. To achieve this, they would lower the initial 30 NK15-F engines to 24 engines around the rim, leaving the center free. Their goal was to achieve better performance at sea level. Further concepts removed the NK-15Fs altogether and replace them with a radical annular combustion chamber. This chamber would surround the aerospike in its entirety. However, both ideas were thrown out as the calculated performance gains didn&#x27;t outweigh the additional mass and complexities of the different engines.

Because of its technical difficulties and lack of funding for a comprehensive test campaign, the N1 never completed a test flight. Twelve test flights were planned, with only four flown. All four uncrewed launches ended in failure before first-stage separation. The longest flight lasted 107 seconds, just before first-stage separation. Two test launches occurred in 1969, one in 1971, and the final one in 1972.

===Comparison with Saturn V===
At , the N1-L3 was slightly shorter than the American Apollo-Saturn V (). The N-1 had a smaller overall diameter but a greater maximum diameter ( vs. ). The N1 produced more thrust in each of its first three stages than the corresponding stages of the Saturn V. The N1-L3 produced more total impulse in its first four stages than the Saturn V did in its three (see table below).

The N1 was intended to place the approximately L3 payload into low Earth orbit, with the fourth stage included in the L3 complex intended to place into translunar orbit. In comparison, the Saturn V placed the roughly Apollo spacecraft plus about of fuel remaining in the S-IVB third stage for translunar injection into a similar Earth parking orbit.

The N1 used kerosene-based rocket fuel in all three of its main stages, while the Saturn V used liquid hydrogen to fuel its second and third stages, which yielded an overall performance advantage due to the higher specific impulse. The N1 also wasted available propellant volume by using spherical propellant tanks under a roughly conical external skin, while the Saturn V used most of its available cylindrical skin volume to house capsule-shaped hydrogen and oxygen tanks, with common bulkheads between the tanks in the second and third stages.

The N1-L3 would have been able to convert only 9.3% of its three-stage total impulse into Earth orbit payload momentum (compared to 12.14% for the Saturn V), and only 3.1% of its four-stage total impulse into translunar payload momentum, compared to 6.2% for the Saturn V.

The Saturn V also never lost a payload in two development and eleven operational launches, while four N1 development launch attempts all resulted in catastrophic failure, with two payload losses.

== Launch history ==
===First failure, serial 3L===
February 21, 1969: serial number 3L – Zond L1S-1 (Soyuz 7K-L1S (Zond-M) modification of Soyuz 7K-L1 &quot;Zond&quot; spacecraft) for Moon flyby.

A few seconds into launch, a transient voltage caused the KORD to shut down Engine #12. After this happened, the KORD shut off Engine #24 to maintain symmetrical thrust. At T+6 seconds, pogo oscillation in the #2 engine tore several components off their mounts and started a propellant leak. At T+25 seconds, further vibrations ruptured a fuel line and caused RP-1 to spill into the aft section of the booster. When it came into contact with the leaking gas, a fire started. The fire then burned through wiring in the power supply, causing electrical arcing that was picked up by sensors and interpreted by the KORD as a pressurization problem in the turbopumps. The KORD responded by issuing a general command to shut down the entire first stage at T+68 seconds into launch. This signal was also transmitted up to the second and third stages, &quot;locking&quot; them and preventing a manual ground command from being sent to start their engines. Telemetry also showed that the power generators in the N-1 continued functioning until the impact with the ground at T+183 seconds. 

Investigators discovered the remains of the rocket 52 kilometers (32 miles) from the launch pad. Vasily Mishin had initially blamed the generators for the failure, as he could not think of any other reason why all 30 engines would shut down at once, but this was quickly disproven by telemetry data and the recovery of the generators from the crash site. They had survived in good condition and were shipped back to the Istra plant, where they were refurbished and worked without any problems under bench testing. The investigative team did not speculate as to whether the burning first stage could have continued flying if the KORD system had not shut it down. 

The KORD was found to have a number of serious design flaws and poorly programmed logic. One unforeseen flaw was that its operating frequency, 1000 Hz, happened to perfectly coincide with vibration generated by the propulsion system, and the shutdown of Engine #12 at liftoff was believed to have been caused by pyrotechnic devices opening a valve, which produced a high-frequency oscillation that went into adjacent wiring and was assumed by the KORD to be an overspeed condition in the engine&#x27;s turbopump. The wiring in Engine #12 was believed to be particularly vulnerable to this effect due to its length; however, other engines had similar wiring and were unaffected. Also, the system&#x27;s operating voltage increased to 25 V instead of the nominal 15 V. The control wiring was relocated and coated with asbestos for fireproofing and the operating frequency changed. The launch escape system was activated and did its job properly, saving the mockup spacecraft. All subsequent flights had freon fire extinguishers installed next to every engine. According to Sergei Afanasiev, the logic of the command to shut down the entire cluster of 30 engines in Block A was incorrect in that instance, as the subsequent investigation revealed.

===Second failure, serial 5L===
Serial number 5L – Zond L1S-2 for Moon orbit and flyby and intended photography of possible crewed landing sites.

The second N-1 vehicle was launched on 3 July 1969 and carried a modified L1 Zond spacecraft and live escape tower. Boris Chertok claimed that a mass model lunar module was also carried; however, most sources indicate that only the L1S-2 and boost stages were on board N-1 5L. Launch took place at 23:18 Moscow time from launch pad 110 East. The flight lasted only a few moments; as soon as it cleared the tower, there was a flash of light, and debris could be seen falling from the bottom of the first stage. All engines instantly shut down except engine #18. This caused the N-1 to lean over at a 45-degree angle and drop back onto the pad. The nearly 2300 tons of propellant on board triggered a massive blast and shock wave that shattered windows across the launch complex and sent debris flying as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the center of the explosion. Launch crews were permitted outside half an hour after the accident and encountered droplets of unburnt fuel still raining down from the sky. The majority of the N-1&#x27;s propellant load had not been consumed in the accident, and most of what had burned had been in the first stage of the rocket. However, the worst-case scenario, mixing of the fuel and LOX to form an explosive gel, had not occurred. The subsequent investigation revealed that up to 85% of the propellant on board the rocket had not detonated, reducing the force of the blast.
The launch escape system had activated at the moment of engine shutdown (T+15 seconds) and pulled the L1S-2 capsule to safety 2.0 kilometers (1.2 miles) away. Impact with the pad occurred at T+23 seconds. Launch Complex 110 East was thoroughly leveled by the blast, with the concrete pad caved in and one of the lighting towers knocked over and twisted around itself. Despite the devastation, most of the telemetry tapes were found intact in the debris field and examined.

It was found that the LOX turbopump in the #8 engine had exploded just before liftoff. (The pump was recovered from the debris and found to have signs of fire and melting). The resultant shock wave severed surrounding propellant lines and started a fire from leaking fuel. The fire had damaged various components in the thrust section leading to the engines gradually being shut down between T+10 and T+12 seconds. The KORD had shut off engines #7, #19, #20, and #21 after detecting abnormal pressure and pump speeds. Telemetry did not provide any explanation as to what shut off the other engines. Engine #18, which had caused the booster to lean over 45 degrees, continued operating until impact, something engineers were never able to satisfactorily explain.

Why the #8 turbopump had exploded could not be determined exactly. Working theories were that either a piece of a pressure sensor had broken off and lodged in the pump, or that its impeller blades had rubbed against the metal casing, creating a friction spark that had ignited the LOX. The #8 engine had operated erratically prior to shutdown and a pressure sensor detected &quot;incredible force&quot; in the pump. Vasily Mishin believed that a pump rotor had disintegrated, but Kuznetsov argued that the NK-15 engines were entirely blameless and Mishin, who had defended the use of Kuznetsov&#x27;s engines two years earlier, could not publicly come out and challenge him. Kuznetsov succeeded in getting the postflight investigative committee to rule the cause of the engine failure as &quot;ingestion of foreign debris&quot;.
After this flight, fuel filters were installed in later models.
Vladimir Barmin, chief director of launch facilities at Baikonur, also argued that the KORD should be locked for the first 15–20 seconds of flight to prevent a shutdown command from being issued until the booster had cleared the pad area.
The destroyed complex was photographed by American satellites, disclosing to the Western World that the Soviet Union had been constructing a Moon rocket.
It took 18 months to rebuild the launch pad and delayed launches. The explosion had been visible that evening 35 kilometres (22 miles) away at Leninsk (See Tyuratam).

===Third failure, serial 6L===
June 26, 1971: serial number 6L – dummy Soyuz 7K-LOK (Soyuz 7K-L1E No.1) and dummy LK module-spacecraft

Soon after lift-off, due to unexpected eddies and counter-currents at the base of Block A (the first stage), the N-1 experienced an uncontrolled roll beyond the capability of the control system to compensate. The KORD computer sensed an abnormal situation and sent a shutdown command to the first stage, but as noted above, the guidance program had since been modified to prevent this from happening until 50 seconds into launch. The roll, which had initially been 6° per second, began rapidly accelerating. At T+39 seconds, the booster was rolling at nearly 40° per second, causing the inertial guidance system to go into gimbal lock and at T+48 seconds, the vehicle disintegrated from structural loads. The interstage truss between the second and third stages twisted apart and the latter separated from the stack and at T+50 seconds, the cutoff command to the first stage was unblocked and the engines immediately shut down. The upper stages impacted about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the launch complex. Despite the engine shutoff, the first and second stages still had enough momentum to travel for some distance before falling to earth about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the launch complex and blasting a crater in the steppe. This N1 had dummy upper stages without the rescue system. 

The next, last vehicle would have a much more powerful stabilization system with dedicated engines (in the previous versions stabilization was done by directing exhaust from the main engines). The engine control system would also be reworked, increasing the number of sensors from 700 to 13,000.

===Fourth failure, serial 7L===
November 23, 1972: serial number 7L – regular Soyuz 7K-LOK (Soyuz 7K-LOK No.1) and dummy LK module-spacecraft for Moon flyby

Debut of the S-530 digital control system (in the third stage) which superseded the KORD analog system.

The start and lift-off went well. At T+90 seconds, a programmed shutdown of the core propulsion system (the six center engines) was performed to reduce structural stress on the booster. Because of excessive dynamic loads caused by a hydraulic shock wave when the six engines were shut down abruptly, lines for feeding fuel and oxidizer to the core propulsion system burst and a fire started in the boattail of the booster; in addition, the #4 engine exploded. The first stage broke up starting at T+107 seconds and all telemetry data ceased at T+110 seconds. The launch escape system activated and pulled the Soyuz 7K-LOK to safety. The upper stages were ejected from the stack and crashed into the steppe. An investigation revealed that the abrupt shutdown of the engines led to fluctuations in the fluid columns of the feeder pipes, which ruptured and spilled fuel and oxidizer onto the shut down, but still hot, engines. A failure of the #4 engine turbopump was also suspected. It was believed that the launch could have been salvaged had ground controllers sent a manual command to jettison the first stage and begin second stage burn early as the stage failed only 15 seconds before it was due to separate at T+125 seconds and it had reached the nominal burn time of 110 seconds according to the cyclogram.

===Canceled fifth launch===
Vehicle serial number 8L was prepared for August 1974. It included a regular 7K-LOK Soyuz 7K-LOK and a regular LK module-spacecraft of the L3 lunar expedition complex. It was intended for a Moon flyby and uncrewed landing in preparation for a future crewed mission. As the N1-L3 program was canceled in May 1974, this launch never took place.

==Confusion on L3 designation==
There is confusion among Russian online sources as to whether N1-L3 (Russian: Н1-Л3) or N1-LZ (Russian: Н1-ЛЗ) was intended, because of the similarity of the Cyrillic letter Ze for &quot;Z&quot; and the numeral &quot;3&quot;. Sometimes both forms are used within the same Russian website (or even the same article). English sources refer only to N1-L3. The correct designation is L3, representing one of the five branches of Soviet lunar exploration. Stage 1 (Л1) was planned as a crewed circumlunar flight (partially realized in the Zond program); stage 2 (Л2) was an uncrewed lunar rover (realized in Lunokhod); stage 3 (Л3) was to have been a crewed lunar landing; stage 4 (Л4) was conceptualized as a crewed spacecraft in lunar orbit; and stage 5 (Л5) was conceptualized as a heavy crewed lunar rover to support a crew of 3–5 people.

<doc id="704429" wikidata="Q157610" url="?curid=704429" title="Lovis Corinth">
<text>Lovis Corinth (21 July 1858 – 17 July 1925) was a German artist and writer whose mature work as a painter and printmaker realized a synthesis of impressionism and expressionism.

Corinth studied in Paris and Munich, joined the Berlin Secession group, later succeeding Max Liebermann as the group&#x27;s president. His early work was naturalistic in approach. Corinth was initially antagonistic towards the expressionist movement, but after a stroke in 1911 his style loosened and took on many expressionistic qualities. His use of color became more vibrant, and he created portraits and landscapes of extraordinary vitality and power. Corinth&#x27;s subject matter also included nudes and biblical scenes.

==Early life==
Corinth was born Franz Heinrich Louis on 21 July 1858 in Tapiau, in the Province of Prussia in the Kingdom of Prussia. The son of a tanner, he displayed a talent for drawing as a child. In 1876 he went to study painting in the academy of Königsberg. Initially intending to become a history painter, he was dissuaded from this course by his chief instructor at the academy, the genre painter Otto Günther. In 1880 he traveled to Munich, which rivaled Paris as the avant-garde art center in Europe at the time. There he studied briefly with Franz von Defregger before gaining admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, where he studied under Ludwig von Löfftz. The realism of Corinth&#x27;s early works was encouraged by Löfftz&#x27;s teaching, which emphasized careful observation of colors and values. Other important influences were Courbet and the Barbizon school, through their interpretation by the Munich artists Wilhelm Leibl and Wilhelm Trübner .

Except for an interruption for military service in 1882–83, Corinth studied with Löfftz until 1884. He then traveled to Antwerp, where he greatly admired the paintings of Rubens, and then in October 1884 to Paris where he studied under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury at the Académie Julian. He concentrated especially on improving his drawing skills, and made the female nude his frequent subject. He was disappointed, however, in his repeated failure to win a medal at the Salon, and returned to Königsberg in 1888 when he adopted the name &quot;Lovis Corinth&quot;.

==Career==
In 1891, Corinth returned to Munich, but in 1892 he abandoned the Munich Academy and joined the Munich Secession. In 1894 he joined the Free Association, and in 1899 he participated in an exhibition organized by the Berlin Secession. These nine years in Munich were not his most productive, and he was perhaps better known for his ability to drink large amounts of red wine and champagne.

Corinth moved to Berlin in 1900, and had a one-man exhibition at a gallery owned by Paul Cassirer. In 1902 at the age of 43, he opened a school of painting for women and married his first student, Charlotte Berend, some 20 years his junior. Charlotte was his youthful muse, his spiritual partner, and the mother of his two children. She had a profound influence on him, and family life became a major theme in his art. Another of his students was Doramaria Purschian.

He published numerous essays on art history, and in 1908 published &quot;Das Erlernen der Malerei&quot; (&quot;On Learning to Paint&quot;).

In December 1911, he suffered a stroke, and was partially paralyzed on his left side. Thereafter he walked with a limp, and his hands displayed a chronic tremor. With the help of his wife, within a year he was painting again with his right hand. His disability inspired in the artist an intense interest in the simple, intimate things of daily life. In the summer of 1919, for example, he produced a cycle of casual etchings of his family in their country home. It was also at this time that landscapes became a significant part of his oeuvre. These landscapes were set at the Walchensee, a lake in the Bavarian Alps where Corinth owned a house. Their lively picturing, in bright colors, tempt many to consider the Walchensee series as his best work.

He painted numerous self-portraits, and made a habit of painting one every year on his birthday as a means of self-examination. In many of his self-portraits he assumed guises such as an armored knight (&quot;The Victor&quot;, 1910), or Samson (&quot;The Blinded Samson&quot;, 1912).

Not all of Corinth&#x27;s works were appreciated in his lifetime: upon learning of his death, Danish critic Georg Brandes wrote in a letter to his secretary that it was Corinth&#x27;s &quot;punishment for such a wretched portrait of myself&quot;.

From 1915–25, he served as President of the Berlin Secession. In 1920 an anthology of his art-historical writings was published in Berlin. In 1922 his works were exhibited in the Venice Biennale. On 15 March 1921 Corinth received an honorary doctorate from the University of Königsberg. In 1925, he traveled to the Netherlands to view the works of his favorite Dutch masters. He caught pneumonia and died in Zandvoort. He was buried at Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery near Berlin.

===Printmaking===
Corinth explored every print technique except aquatint; he favored drypoint and lithography. He created his first etching in 1891 and his first lithograph in 1894. He experimented with the woodcut medium but made only 12 woodcuts, all of them between 1919 and 1924. He was quite prolific, and in the last 15 years of his life he produced more than 900 graphic works, including 60 self-portraits. The landscapes he created between 1919 and 1925 are perhaps the most desirable images of his entire graphic oeuvre.

==Legacy==
The house where Corinth was born is still in the town of Tapiau, which is now called Gvardeysk, and located in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia.

In 1910 Corinth had donated the painting &quot;Golgatha&quot; for the altar of the church of his birthplace, Tapiau. At the end of the Second World War, when the Red Army invaded East Prussia, this painting disappeared without trace. Tapiau was among the few East Prussian places not devastated by the war, which makes it likely that the painting was looted rather than destroyed.

In 1926, a commemorative exhibition of Corinth&#x27;s paintings and watercolors was presented at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and an exhibition of his prints and drawings was held at the Berlin Academy. By 1930 the Nationalgalerie acquired several major paintings by Corinth in addition to those already in its collection.

During the Third Reich, Corinth&#x27;s work was condemned by the Nazis as degenerate art. In 1937, Nazi authorities removed 295 of his works from public collections, and transported seven of them to Munich where they were displayed in March 1937 in the Degenerate Art Exhibition.

In 2007, the German city of Hanover returned a painting by Corinth to the heirs of Jewish collector Curt Glaser, who sold it in 1933 to fund his escape from the Nazis. The painting from 1914, &quot; (Roman Landscape)&quot;, was handed to Glaser&#x27;s heirs, represented by his U.S.-based niece and her daughter.

In 2015 heirs of Holocaust victims Thea and Fritz Goldschmidt made a restitution claim for Covinth&#x27;s &quot;Tyrolean Woman with Ca&quot;t” (“Tirolerin mit Katze”) after the painting appeared at the Im Kinsky auction house in Vienna on sale from an anonymous owner. The Austrian auction house refused to say who bought the looted painting. The painting is listed on the German Lost Art Foundation Lostart Database and on the Monuments Men Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted List&quot; of stolen art.

In June 2021, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels agreed to return Corinth&#x27;s 1913 &quot;Blumenstilleben (Still Life with Flowers)&quot; to the heir of Gustav and Emma Mayer, who were persecuted by the Nazis and forced to flee because of their Jewish heritage.

<text>Zachary Macaulay (; 2 May 1768 – 13 May 1838) was a Scottish statistician and abolitionist who was a founder of London University and of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and a Governor of British Sierra Leone.

==Early life==
Macaulay was born in Inveraray, Scotland, to Margaret Campbell and John Macaulay (1720 – 1789), who was a minister of the Church of Scotland and a grandson of Dòmhnall Cam. He had two brothers: Aulay Macaulay, who was an antiquary, and Colin Macaulay, who was a general and an abolitionist. Zachary Macaulay was not educated in, but taught himself, Greek and Latin and English literature.

==Career==
Macaulay worked in a merchant&#x27;s office in Glasgow, where he fell into bad company and began to indulge in excessive drinking. In late 1784, when aged 16, he emigrated to Jamaica. There, he worked as an assistant manager at a sugar plantation. However, he objected to slavery, contrary to the preference of his father, and renounced his job. He returned, in 1789, to London, where he reduced his alcoholism and became a bookkeeper. He was influenced by Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, an evangelical Whig abolitionist whom his sister Jean had married, and by whom he was influenced and introduced to William Wilberforce and Henry Thornton. In 1790, Macaulay visited Sierra Leone, the West African colony that was founded by the Sierra Leone Company for emancipated slaves. In 1792, he returned to serve on its Council. He was invested as Governor in 1794, and remained in that role until 1799.

Macaulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, with William Wilberforce, to campaign for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. He later became the secretary of the African Institution. He and Wilberforce also became members of the Clapham Sect of evangelical Whigs, that included Henry Thornton and Edward Eliot, for whom he edited the magazine, the &quot;Christian Observer&quot;, from 1802 to 1816. Macaulay served on committees that established London University, and that established the Society for the Suppression of Vice. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society, and an active supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society, and of the Cheap Repository Tracts, and of the Church Missionary Society. Macaulay contributed to the 1823 foundation of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery, and he was editor of its publication, the &quot;Anti-Slavery Reporter&quot;, in which he censured the analysis of indentured labour by the British Colonial Office expert Thomas Moody However, Zachary Macaulay desired a &#x27;free black peasantry&#x27; rather than equality for Africans.

Macaulay died on 13 May 1838 in London, where he was buried in St George&#x27;s Gardens, Bloomsbury, and where a memorial to him was erected in Westminster Abbey.

==Personal life==
Macaulay married Selina Mills, who was the daughter of the Quaker printer Thomas Mills. They were introduced by Hannah More on 26 August 1799. They settled in Clapham, Surrey, and had several children including Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was a Whig historian and politician, and Hannah More Macaulay (1810 – 1873), who married Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet and was the mother of Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet.

<text>A squeegee man or squeegee woman, squeegee kid (Canada), squeegee boy (Baltimore), squeegee punk (Montreal), squeegee merchant (London), squeegee guy or squeegee bandit is a person who, using a washcloth and squeegee, wipes windshields of cars stopped in traffic in exchange for money.

==By country==

===Canada===
In Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, and Winnipeg, they are known as squeegee kids and they are mostly tolerated, since they are considered to be working for money, rather than begging. In Montreal, they are often called squeegee punks, in reference to their appearance, or simply squeegees. In 1999, the Ontario government passed the Safe Streets Act, outlawing squeegee kids and aggressive public begging. The Government of British Columbia has adopted a word for word version of the Ontario Safe Street Act. Squeegee kids have become scarce in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, BC, as police frequently stop them and check their identities for outstanding arrest warrants.

In 2011, then Deputy Mayor of Toronto Doug Holyday told the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; that there was the will in council to step up action against panhandlers, including squeegee kids; the proposition was mocked by some media, given the previous efforts, and the suggestion that the homeless would have to pay fines.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, window washing mostly occurs in Auckland, particularly Manukau. Window washers are considered &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;frustrating&quot; by drivers and Manukau Police. In 2017, the activity was outlawed by the Land Transport Amendment Act. The law&#x27;s effectiveness has been questioned, as five years after it was enacted, the 2157 people that had been caught window washing were generally not deterred, and only six had paid fines.

===United Kingdom===
Londoners, and perhaps others, extend the appellation to include those who roam in the midst of stopped traffic to not only wash windscreens, but also hawk items such as roses and newspapers. For this reason, they are sometimes called squeegee merchants.

===United States===
In New York City in the 1980s, the usual procedure would involve groups of squeegee men surrounding cars stopped in traffic. Although some merely provided a service, in other cases the windshield-washing would be carried out without asking, often perfunctorily, and with subsequent demands for money, sometimes with added threats of smashing the car&#x27;s windshield. Upon his election, mayor Rudy Giuliani famously sought to remove squeegee men from the streets as part of his quality-of-life campaign, claiming that their near-ubiquitous presence created an environment of disorder that encouraged more serious crime to flourish. Squeegee men disappeared from city streets during Giuliani&#x27;s mayoralty and did not reappear in significant numbers.

Squeegee men were among the first targeted by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Commissioner William Bratton. In his book &quot;Leadership&quot;, Giuliani explained that his method of removing the squeegee men from the street involved arresting them. Patrolmen who first made the arrests saw that the squeegee men were released immediately, because according to the New York penal code at the time, cleaning someone&#x27;s windshield was not illegal. Giuliani told the officers that if they saw any more squeegee men they should simply arrest them for jaywalking.

Squeegee men (or &quot;squeegee boys&quot; for younger examples) remain prevalent in Baltimore, Maryland.

<doc id="704465" wikidata="Q2273696" url="?curid=704465" title="Tiananmen Mothers">
<text>The Tiananmen Mothers () is a group of Chinese democracy activists promoting a change in the government&#x27;s position over the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. It is led by Ding Zilin, a retired university professor whose teenage son was shot and killed by government troops during the protests. The group – comprising the parents, friends and relatives of victims of the massacre – formed in September 1989 when Ding, along with her husband Jiang Peikun, met another mother, Zhang Xianling, whose 19-year-old son was also killed on June 4, 1989. As well as campaigning, the group also disseminates information about the events to the public, including through the internet. Currently, the group consists of relatives of 125 individuals killed during the protests. For her efforts, Ding has been hailed as an &quot;advocate for the dead&quot;.

==Background==
A large group of Beijing-based student activists (along with nearby people) were shot on the orders of Deng Xiaoping, then a chief military commander of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. This happened during the summer of 1989, centered around sunset in the evening on June 4. Beijing medical doctors from the very beginning recall critically injured patients being carried into hospitals of nearly all specialties, throughout the night continuing into noon.

==Formation==

Prior to June 1989, Ding Zilin was a Philosophy professor at the People&#x27;s University and a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On June 3, 1989, her 17-year-old son Jiang Jielian was killed on his way to Tiananmen Square. Ding launched a one-woman campaign to establish what had happened to her son and those who were killed that night. The government had put her under surveillance and Ding experienced harassment as she met with other victims families. Describing the organisation, Ding announced that the group were &quot;a common group of citizens brought together by a shared fate and suffering&quot;.

Despite the expansion of the group, many Chinese intellectuals had kept away from the movement, as they did with the Democracy Wall movement in the late 1970s. One exception was Wu Zuguang, who advocated a reversal of the governments position at a meeting of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in 1997, and he did not suffer any repercussions for his comments because of his age. Other members of the group included prominent student Jiang Qisheng, a graduate of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics who became head of the Beijing Student Autonomous Federation which acted in conjunction with other universities and formed part of a delegation that met with Chinese Premier Li Peng to try and resolve the Tiananmen protests peacefully. He was jailed for 18 months and upon his release in February 1991, was denied regular employment.

Further promoting their campaign, members of the Tiananmen Mothers sought to gain the attention of the international media. In a May 1991 interview with ABC, Ding and Zhang Xianling condemned the actions of the Chinese government and in particular Premier Li Peng who claimed that the crackdown was necessary in order to maintain social stability. She also called on people of conscience not to forget those who had lost their lives. Three years later in 1994, and on the fifth anniversary of the crackdown, Ding published &quot;The Factual Account of a Search for the June 4 Victims&quot; listing 96 individuals who had been killed. By the tenth anniversary on June 4, 1999, she had reported 155 deaths and 65 who were injured but noted that these were &quot;only the tip of the iceberg... but at least it is visible.&quot;

Ding&#x27;s regular public campaigning, including public petitions and lawsuits against the government, saw her expelled from the party in May 1992, and both Ding and her husband, also a professor at the university, were forced into retirement in 1993. The Tiananmen Mothers movement has also inspired other families of political prisoners to campaign for their release. Since then, a few dozen families meet together regularly on every anniversary of the crackdown, despite government intimidation. Ding and other members have occasionally been detained by authorities as a result of their actions.

==Campaign==

===Demands===
The Chinese government currently views the protests as a &quot;counterrevolutionary uprising&quot;. The Tiananmen Mothers group, which was conducted without official approval, put forward a five-point demand to the Chinese government in relation to the protest:

*The right to mourn peacefully in public;
*The right to accept humanitarian aid from organizations and individuals inside and outside China;
*No more persecution of victims, including those injured in the shootings and the families of the dead;
*The release of all people still in prison for their role in the 1989 protests; and
*A full, public investigation into the crackdown

The group also wants the Chinese government to name the dead, compensate families and punish those responsible. The government made a payout of 70,000 yuan for the first time in 2006 to one of the victims families. The move was welcomed by Zilin, though she said it was unlikely to indicate a change in the government&#x27;s position.

===Public appeals===
The Tiananmen Mothers have made many public appeals, challenging the government. They protested to the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, the judiciary and the population. The group has also opened up contacts with UN Human Rights Council and foreign media, issuing a video demanding the government reassess Tiananmen. On the tenth anniversary, despite memories of the event fading due to strong government censorship, Jiang Qisheng, who had since been released, drafted a letter along with fifteen others appealing for quiet commemoration by lighting candles in cities across China. He played a major role in organising the event, posting flyers on lampposts calling on the population to &quot;light a myriad of candles to collectively commemorate the brave spirits of June Fourth&quot; and as a result, several petitions to hold protest were submitted, but were rejected by government authorities. Jiang was arrested on shortly before the anniversary; in court on November 1, 1999, he defended himself, maintaining he was exercising freedom of speech and recalling a previous reversal of the government&#x27;s term &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; after the Gang of Four and Cultural Revolution. He urged the government not to imprison people for expressing their views, &quot;Simply by writing and talking, do I commit such a crime against heaven that I must be put to death?&quot; and his lawyer, Mao Shaoping argued that the group&#x27;s activities did not amount to &quot;subversion of state power&quot;. Jiang was charged and released from prison on May 19, 2003.

Despite Jiang&#x27;s arrest, Ding remained undeterred. On June 4, 1999, the group presented a petition signed by 108 relatives to the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate, asking for a legal ruling on the deaths of the protestors. The petition contained evidence they had collected including testimonies and names of the dead and injured. They asserted that they were exercising their political rights, and not engaging in any illegal activities. The movement still continues, receiving warnings not to commemorate and undergoing increased surveillance around June 3–4 every year. An increasing number of dissidents and former intellectuals from the party, including Hu Yaobang&#x27;s former secretary and Huang Qi have joined the group, and have been expelled from the establishment as a result.

In 2009, the organisation urged the government to &quot;break the taboo&quot; surrounding the incident. The Tiananmen Mothers website is blocked by internet censors in China.

Analysts say pressure by groups like the Tiananmen Mothers may eventually lead to some acknowledgment of the deaths during the crackdown, such as a plaque placed on the square, but most agree that will not come soon.

===Arrests===
Ding Zilin; Zhang Xianling, who lost her 19-year-old son; and Huang Jinping, who lost her 30-year-old husband, were detained in March 2004. Authorities first denied the arrests, but later said they had been detained for engaging in what were described as illegal activities sponsored by overseas forces. They were released later in the week but remained under close surveillance in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of the protests.

The women have been under what advocates describe as house arrest. All their calls are monitored and they are told not to talk to other activists, with foreign media, and with human rights organizations.

===Newspaper advert controversy===
On June 4, 2007, the &quot;Chengdu Evening News&quot; ran a one-page line commemorating the Tiananmen Mothers, stating, &quot;Saluting the strong mothers of June 4th victims.&quot; Officials at the newspaper refused to answer questions regarding the advert. It was later suggested that the person who ran the advert was unaware of the significance of &quot;6/4&quot;, instead being told it was related to a mining disaster that took place. Three editors were later fired from the paper.

<text>Admiral Francis Holburne (1704 – 15 July 1771) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. He served as commodore and commander-in-chief at the Leeward Islands during the War of the Austrian Succession and then took part in an operation to capture Louisbourg as part of the Louisbourg Expedition during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He went on to be Port Admiral at Portsmouth and then Senior Naval Lord. In retirement he became Governor of Greenwich Hospital. He also served as a Member of Parliament.

==Origins==
He was born in 1704 the second son of Sir James Holburn, 1st Baronet of Menstrie, Clackmannan, Scotland, by his wife Jean Spittal, a daughter of Alexander Spittal of Leuchat. He was the brother to James Holburne, 2nd Baronet and William Holburne, who both served in the Navy.

==Naval career==
===Early career===
Francis entered the Navy in 1720 as a volunteer aboard , passing his examinations in 1725. Promoted to lieutenant on 12 December 1727, he was given command of the sloop HMS &quot;Swift&quot; in October 1735.

Holburne had known Lord Morton as an intimate family friend and may well have owed his advancement in the Navy to Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll who &quot;took him by the hand in his younger days and made him a captain&quot;. Promoted to post-captain on 15 February 1740, he was given command of the sixth-rate HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. He transferred to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; in 1743 and to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot; in 1746 and then became commodore and commander-in-chief at the Leeward Islands with his broad pennant in the third-rate HMS &quot;Kent&quot; in 1748 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He went on to take command of the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Tavistock&quot; in 1749 and the second-rate HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; in 1755.

Holburne aroused some resentment amongst his peers with Admiral Lord Boscawen saying in a private letter to his wife in June 1755 &quot;he is rich and has contrived to insinuate himself into the good graces of Lord Anson.&quot;

===Flag officer===
Promoted to rear-admiral on 5 February 1755, Holburne was quickly sent in May to reinforce Admiral Edward Boscawen&#x27;s fleet in the North Atlantic. Boscawen&#x27;s mission to intercept French ships from resupplying Canada was in danger as his ships&#x27; companies were not only sickly but short of men. Holburne was later appointed a member of the court-martial that was convened to try Admiral John Byng. The trial began in December 1756 and ran until late January 1757. When members of the tribunal requested to be relieved of their oaths before the House of Lords to save Byng, Holburne refused. &quot;...all the court martial seemed terrified...except old Admiral Holburne, who cursed and swore at the bar of the House, because Byng was not shot out of the way, without giving him the trouble of coming from Portsmouth&quot;.

Promoted to vice-admiral in February 1757, Holburne embarked on a command at Halifax, Nova Scotia to capture Louisbourg as part of the Louisbourg Expedition led by Lord Loudon. There were many delays, and fever had struck his fleet, causing much of it to remain in port. On the night of 24 September they were caught up in a violent storm which drove the 60-gun onto the shore, sank the 14-gun and dismasted most of the remainder of his fleet. Holburne sent the most heavily damaged ships back to England while he wintered in Halifax with the rest of the fleet. On 4 February 1758 he was advanced to Vice Admiral of the White and thereafter returned to England, with his North American command transferring to Admiral Edward Boscawen.

On return to London Holburne was also appointed to the post of Port Admiral at Portsmouth, which largely discontinued his active service at sea. In September 1760 Francis made political capital of his position as Port Admiral when he stood for Provost in his native lands at Inverkeithing. It is reported that he unscrupulously brought in armed press gangs to a trades meeting and with his sword drawn and by intimidation and bribery secured the return of his party.

In July 1761, some three years after the loss of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, the 70-gun ran aground on the Horse Sands. Her loss caused Holburne to issue an order to all naval shipping masters, &quot;...to sound out the channels, which they should do several times by way of refreshing their memories, this being the second great ship they have run ashore lately.&quot; His orders did not have the effect he had intended as in October that year, just four months later, the 50-gun ran aground off Ryde.

In November 1764 Holburne ordered a secret investigation into an apparent plot to set fire to Portsmouth Dockyard. He was promoted to full admiral in 1766. As his port commission progressed, and encouraged by his friend and patron Lord Argyll, he contested the seat of Stirling Burghs at the 1761 General Election, beginning a career in politics. He was returned as MP for Stirling and in 1768 he represented Plymouth, holding the seat until his death in 1771. He was appointed to the Board of Admiralty as Senior Naval Lord under the North Ministry in February 1770, holding office until he was made Governor of Greenwich Hospital, by way of retirement, in February 1771. He lived at Laurel Lodge in Twickenham and died just a few months later, in July 1771.

==Family==
In 1750 he married a rich widow, Frances, the daughter of Guy Ball, a member of the Barbados Council. Frances was the widow of Edward Lascelles, Collector of Customs at Barbados. They had one son, born in 1752, Francis who would later be known as Sir Francis Holburn, 4th Baronet in 1772 after succeeding the baronetcy from the cousin of the older Francis, Sir Alexander Holburn, 3rd Baronet.

<text>Olympique Gymnaste Club de Nice (), commonly referred to as OGC Nice or simply Nice, is a French professional football club based in Nice. The club was founded in 1904 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football. Nice plays its home matches at the Allianz Riviera.

Nice was founded under the name &quot;Gymnaste Club de Nice&quot; and is one of the founding members of the first division of French football. The club has won Ligue 1 four times, the Trophée des Champions one time and the Coupe de France three times. It achieved most of its honours in the 1950s with the club being managed by coaches such as Numa Andoire, Englishman William Berry, and Jean Luciano. The club&#x27;s last honour was winning the Coupe de France in 1997 after defeating Guingamp 4–3 on penalties in the final. Nice&#x27;s colours are red and black.

During the club&#x27;s successful run in the 1950s, Nice was among the first French clubs to successfully integrate international players into the fold. Notable players include Héctor de Bourgoing, Pancho Gonzales, Victor Nurenberg, and Joaquín Valle, the latter being the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer and arguably the greatest player.

== History ==

Gymnaste Club &#x27;Azur was founded in the residential district of Les Baumettes on 9 July 1904 under the name Gymnaste Club. The club was founded by Marquis de Massingy d&#x27;Auzac, who served as president of the &quot;Fédération Sportive des Alpes-Maritimes (). Akin to its name, the club primarily focused on the sports of gymnastics and athletics. On 6 July 1908, in an effort to remain affiliated with the FSAM and also join the amateur federation USFSA, the head of French football at the time, &quot;Gymnaste Club de Nice&quot; split into two sections with the new section of the club being named &quot;Gymnastes Amateurs Club de Nice&quot;. The new section spawned a football club and, after two seasons, the two clubs merged. On 20 September 1919, Nice merged with the local club &quot;Gallia Football Athlétic Club&quot; and, subsequently, adopted the club&#x27;s red and black combination. In 1920, the club was playing in the Ligue du Sud-Est, a regional league under the watch of the French Football Federation. While playing in the league, Nice developed rivalries with Cannes and Marseille. On 22 December 1924, the club changed its name to Olympique Gymnaste Club de Nice.

In July 1930, the National Council of the French Football Federation voted 128–20 in support of professionalism in French football. Nice, along with most clubs from southern France, were among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and subsequently became professional and were founding members of the new league. In the league&#x27;s inaugural season, Nice finished seventh in its group. In the following season, Nice finished 13th and were relegated from the league. The club did not play league football in the ensuing season and returned to French football in 1936 playing in Division 2. Nice spent the next three years playing in the second division. In 1939, professional football in France was abolished due to World War II. Nonetheless, Nice continued to play league football under amateur status with the club participating in the Ligue du Sud-Est in 1939 and the Ligue du Sud in the following seasons.

After World War II, Nice returned to professional status and was inserted back into the second division. The club achieved promotion back to the first division for the 1948–49 season under the leadership of the Austrian manager Anton Marek. After two seasons of finishing in the top ten, Nice, now led by manager Jean Lardi, achieved its first-ever honour by winning the league title in the 1950–51 season. Led by French internationals Marcel Domingo, Antoine Bonifaci, Abdelaziz Ben Tifour, and Jean Courteaux, as well as the Argentine duo of Pancho Gonzales and Luis Carniglia and the Swede Pär Bengtsson, Nice won the league despite finishing equal on points with Lille. Nice was declared champions due to having more wins (18) than Lille (17). In the following season, under new manager Numa Andoire, Nice won the double after winning both the league and the Coupe de France. In the league, the club defended its title by holding off both Bordeaux and Lille. In the Coupe de France final, Nice faced Bordeaux and defeated the Aquitaine club 5–3 courtesy of goals from five different players.

Nice continued its solid run in the decade by winning the Coupe de France for the second time in 1954. The club, now being led by a young and unknown Just Fontaine, faced southern rivals Marseille and earned a 2–1 victory with Victor Nuremberg and Carniglia scoring the goals. Carniglia retired from football after the season and began managing Nice. In his first season in charge, Nice won the league for a third time after being chased for the entire season by rivals Marseille and Monaco, as well as Lens and Saint-Étienne. After the campaign, Fontaine departed the club for Stade de Reims. Three seasons later, Nice won the last title of the decade in 1959. The club finished the decade (1950–1959) with four league titles and two Coupe de France trophies. Nice also appeared in European competition for the first time in the 1956–57 season, losing to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.

In subsequent decades, Nice struggled to equal the success of the 1950s with Reims and, later Saint-Étienne eclipsing the club in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. During this time, Nice regularly competed in Division 1 with the exception of two seasons in Division 2 in 1965 and 1970. In 1973 and 1976, Nice achieved a second-place finish in the league, its best finish since winning the league in 1959. However, following the latter finish, the club finished in lower positions in the next six seasons and was relegated in the 1981–82 season after finishing 19th. Nice played three seasons in the second division before returning to the top flight in 1985. After six seasons of mid-table finishes, Nice was back in Division 2.
In 1997, Nice, now back in the first division, stunned many after winning the Coupe de France. However, the victory did not shock most French football enthusiasts mainly due to the club&#x27;s competition in the run-up to the final in which Nice faced only Division 2 clubs, save for first division club Bastia. In the final, Nice defeated Guingamp 5–4 on penalties to earn cup success. On a sourer note, Nice were relegated from the first division only days after winning the Coupe de France in dead last in the league. The club spent five seasons in Ligue 2 and returned to Ligue 1 for the 2001–02 season. In the lead-up to the season, Nice failed to meet the financial requirements set by the DNCG and was subsequently relegated to the Championnat National, the third level of French football. However, after achieving stability, mainly due to selling a few players, Nice was allowed into Ligue 1 after successfully appealing. In the 2005–06 season, Nice made it to the final of the Coupe de la Ligue in 2006, losing to Nancy 2–1.

In 2016, a Chinese and American consortium led by Chien Lee and Alex Zheng purchased 80% of the club. In the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season, Nice finished third in the final standings and qualified for the third round of the UEFA Champions League.

On June 11, 2018, Patrick Vieira was announced as Nice manager, replacing Lucien Favre. In the 2018–19 season, Nice finished in 7th place on the table.

In July 2019, it was announced that Jim Ratcliffe acquired the French club for a reported €100 million.

After a run of poor form saw Nice sitting in 11th place in Ligue 1 and eliminated from the Europa League, manager Patrick Vieira was sacked. Vieira&#x27;s assistant, Adrian Ursea, took over as caretaker. Nice would finish the 2020–21 Ligue 1 season in ninth place on the table.

On 28 June 2021, Christophe Galtier was appointed as the new head coach. On 27 June 2022, Lucien Favre returned to Nice as manager.

After a complicated first part of the season, Lucien Favre was fired. He was replaced by the coach of the reserve team Didier Digard. For the following season, Francesco Farioli was appointed as the next head coach.
In the 2023–24 Ligue 1 season, Nice qualified for the UEFA Europa League finishing in 5th place on the table.

== Home stadium ==
From 1927 until 2013, Nice played its home matches at the Stade du Ray. The stadium is, however, officially known as the Stade Léo-Lagrange, named after a French politician who had a stint in politics as the assistant secretary of state for sport. The Stade du Ray went through many renovations, most recently in 1997 and had a capacity of 17,415. The stadium was popular with supporters for being located in the centre of the city, but suffered from its old structure and small capacity, as the Nice metropolitan area has over one million residents.

Nice began to attempt to build a new stadium in 2002. In its first attempt, the club was heavily criticised by local politicians who questioned the usefulness and format of the stadium. Despite the critics, however, the club&#x27;s proposition passed and excavation of the site in the plain of Var, at Nice-Lingostière, began in July 2006. The Tribunal administration of Nice cancelled the project for irregularities committed concerning the fixation of the price of tickets. In October 2008, the new deputy mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, declared that Nice would have a new stadium &quot;no later than 2013&quot;. The new stadium was to be built at the same place as before, at Nice-Lingostière.

On 22 September 2009, French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; reported the Grand Stade Nice had been selected by the French Football Federation (FFF) as 1 of the 12 stadiums to be used in the country&#x27;s bid to host UEFA Euro 2016. The FFF officially made its selections on 11 November 2009, and the city of Nice was selected as a site to host matches during the tournament.
The construction of the Allianz Riviera started in 2011 and was completed in September 2013.

<text>Invincible was originally a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy launched in October 1744. Captured on 14 May 1747, she was taken into Royal Navy service as the third rate HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;. She was wrecked in 1758 after hitting a sandbank. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England.

== Ship design ==
During the early part of the 18th century British ship designers had made few significant advances in design, whereas French shipbuilding benefited from a remarkably creative period. At the time of the capture of &quot;Invincible&quot;, there was not one 74-gun ship in the Royal Navy. By 1805 at the Battle of Trafalgar, three quarters of British ships of the line were of this singular design and the 74-gun ship had become the backbone of all major navies of the world.

&quot;Invincible&quot; was one of the first trio of a new and longer type of 74-gun ships. Until 1738, French 74s had been little more than 154 (French) feet in gundeck length, carrying just thirteen pairs of 36-pounder guns on the lower deck, fourteen pairs of 18-pounder guns on the upper deck and eight pairs of 8-pounder guns on the quarterdeck and forecastle, with the balance of the 74 guns made up of four small 4-pounder guns on the poop. 
This was changed by François Coulomb&#x27;s design for , launched in 1739 at Toulon. The gundeck length was stretched to 164 (French) feet, and the four small guns on the poop were eliminated, replaced by new gunports for an additional pair of 36-pounder guns on the lower deck and an extra pair of 18-pounder guns on the upper deck. This new gun establishment became the standard for all subsequent French 74s. The next two ships, &quot;Invincible&quot; designed by Pierre Morineau and &quot;Le Magnanime&quot; designed by Blaise Geslain, were begun in early 1741 at Rochefort and were each even longer than &quot;Le Terrible&quot;.

== Active service ==
At the First Battle of Cape Finisterre (14 May 1747) during the War of the Austrian Succession, &quot;Invincible&quot; was escorting a convoy of merchant ships when she was sighted by the British channel fleet of 16 ships of the line, which gave chase. &quot;Invincible&quot; attacked the British ships to give the convoy a chance to escape, and alone engaged six British warships. In the end with most of her crew dead or wounded she struck her colours. Gracious in defeat, the French Commander, Saint-Georges, handed his sword to Admiral George Anson.

HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; sank in February 1758 when she hit the &quot;Horse Tail Sand&quot; sandbank, in the East Solent, between Langstone Harbour and the Isle of Wight. The ship remained upright for 3 days after its grounding allowing the crew to safely escape.

== Wreck site ==

The site of the wreck was rediscovered by a fisherman in 1979 and was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 30 September 1980. In 1996 &quot;Amer Ved&quot; grounded at the wrecksite, although it is not clear whether or not this resulted in damage to the remains. In 2013, the wreck was placed on Historic England&#x27;s (then called English Heritage) list of ten most at risk heritage sites due to parts of the ship being exposed by changing seabed levels. In July 2016 it was announced that £2 million of the fines imposed for the Libor banking scandal would be used to fund an excavation of the wreck site. In 2015, Historic England undertook conservation of a number of organic objects, gathered by surface recovery and vulnerable to physical and biological decay, publishing the report in 2018. In 2016, Historic England commissioned Pascoe Archaeology Services to conduct a detailed photogrammetry survey of vulnerable and at-risk areas of the Invincible wreck site.

In 2017, Historic England adopted a Conservation Management Plan for the wreck site.

In December 2019, the BBC was given a preview of some of the 2000 artefacts found at the site, due to go on display to the public in 2020 at Chatham Dockyard as part of a National Museum of the Royal Navy travelling exhibition. These include parts of the ship&#x27;s hull, tobacco pipes and ceramic hair curlers. Items from the wreck were shown in Episode 2 of Series 7 of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Digging for Britain&quot; series.

In June 2022, the lost rudder of the ship was found intact, away from the main shipwreck.

<doc id="704490" wikidata="Q1400476" url="?curid=704490" title="Smarties">
<text>Smarties are dragée chocolate confectionery. They have been manufactured since 1937, originally by H.I. Rowntree &amp; Company in the United Kingdom, and now by Nestlé.

Smarties are oblate spheroids with a minor axis of about and a major axis of about . They come in eight colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, mauve, pink and brown, although the blue variety was temporarily replaced by a white variety in some countries, whilst an alternative natural colouring dye of the blue colour was being researched.

Smarties are sold primarily in Europe, Canada, South Africa, Australia and the Middle East. Smarties are not distributed (except via parallel import) in the United States, where the trademark name is held by the Smarties Candy Company, which manufactures its own hard tablet sweet under the trademark name &quot;Smarties&quot;. In 2007, production moved from York to Hamburg.

==History==
Rowntree&#x27;s of York, England, have been making &quot;Chocolate Beans&quot; since at least 1882. The product was renamed &quot;Smarties Chocolate Beans&quot; in 1937. Rowntree&#x27;s was forced to drop the words &quot;chocolate beans&quot; in 1937 due to trading standards requirements (the use of the word &quot;beans&quot; was felt to be misleading) so adopted the &quot;Milk Chocolate in a Crisp Sugar Shell&quot;. Later, the sweet was rebranded as &quot;Smarties&quot;.
Smarties in the UK were formerly sold in cylindrical cardboard tubes, capped with a colourful plastic lid usually having a letter of the alphabet on it. The purpose of this, according to a Rowntree&#x27;s spokesperson in the 1980s, was for them to be useful as a teaching aid to encourage young children to recognise the letters. Over the last 25 years, Nestlé and Rowntree&#x27;s have manufactured five billion Smarties lids. Some lids are very rare and are now regarded as collectors&#x27; items.
In February 2005, the Smarties tube was replaced with a hexagonal design. The rationale behind changing the design was, according to Nestlé, to make the brand &quot;fresh and appealing&quot; to youngsters; the new packaging is also lighter and more compact, and the lid (which is now a hinged piece of cardboard) has a card clip which holds the lid shut when it is folded over. The new lid still features a letter like the old plastic lids, but it is in the form of a &quot;what [letter] is a [thing]?&quot; question similar to those asked on the British television game show &quot;Blockbusters&quot; (which coincidentally were on hexagonal tiles), the answer for which can be read when the lid is open, next to the hole giving access to the rest of the tube. The hexagonal box is made of one piece of card which is diecut then folded and glued. The hexagon can also be stacked in many layers without the pile collapsing, which is an advantage at the point of sale.

Smarties are no longer manufactured in York; in October 2007, production was moved to Germany, where a third of them were already made. Outside Europe, Nestlé&#x27;s largest production facility for Smarties is in Toronto, Canada, where Nestlé has been manufacturing its products since 1918. The factory located at 72 Sterling Road in the Junction Triangle was originally built for Cowan Cocoa and Chocolate.

In 1998, Nestlé obtained a trademark for a tubular Smarties package. It later sued Master Foods in Denmark, which was marketing M&amp;M minis in a similar package. The Supreme Court of Denmark ruled that a basic geometrical shape could not be trademarked and ordered the trademark to be removed from the trademark register.

In 2021, the parent company Nestlé transferred the production of Lentilky, which had been produced in Czechia since 1907, to German Hamburg, and the ingredients are also being harmonized with the Smarties product.

==Colours==

In one of the earlier ranges of colours, there was a light-brown Smartie. This was replaced in 1988 by a blue Smartie, introduced as part of campaign opposing the purchase of Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery by Nestlé, along with &#x27;I Support Blue Smarties&#x27; pin badges. Before 1958, dark-brown Smarties had a plain-chocolate centre, while light-brown ones were coffee-flavoured. Orange Smarties originally contained orange-flavoured chocolate, however, these days the orange flavour is added to the shell only.

In 2006, it was announced that Nestlé was removing all artificial colourings from Smarties in the United Kingdom. Nestlé decided to replace all synthetic dyes with natural ones, but, unable to source a natural blue dye, removed blue Smarties from circulation (which led to the common misunderstanding that the blue Smartie triggered hyperactivity in some children) and replaced them with white ones. In February 2008, blue smarties were reintroduced using natural blue dye derived from the cyanobacterium spirulina instead of the controversial brilliant blue FCF (FD&amp;C Blue 1, E133).

Artificial colouring was removed from Smarties on the Canadian market in March 2009. The new range included all the colours except blue. Blue Smarties were re-added in May 2010.

Red Smarties were previously dyed with cochineal, a derivative of the product made by extracting colour from female cochineal insects. A pigment extracted from red cabbage is now used in the United Kingdom.

For the purposes of assessing an &quot;active learning approach to epidemiology and critical appraisal&quot;, a mock randomised controlled trial tested the hypothesis that red Smarties could increase happiness. Based on a trial with 117 participants in four settings in Australia, Canada and Malaysia, red Smarties eaters were no happier than yellow Smarties eaters.

==Variants==
Smarties are also sold in the form of chocolate bars and eggs with fragments of Smarties in them, and chocolate-and-vanilla ice cream with Smarties pieces in it known as Smarties Fusion. A variant on Smarties ice cream is the Smarties McFlurry, sold by McDonald&#x27;s. It was discontinued temporarily in 2012, brought back in early 2014 but withdrawn again in late 2015, being replaced with Oreo, but in some countries both are available. For decades Canadian Dairy Queen restaurants offered a Smarties Blizzard, but in 2015 this was dropped and replaced with an M&amp;M&#x27;s Blizzard. The Smarties Blizzard returned to the menu in early 2018.

In 1997, larger-sized Giant Smarties were introduced, and, in 2004, Fruity Smarties. Another variation of Smarties, which contained white chocolate rather than milk chocolate, was also introduced. These were trialled as &quot;Smarctic Frost Bites&quot;, but upon their full release a year or so later, they were called White Chocolate Smarties.

In 1998, a product known as &quot;Smarties Secrets&quot; was introduced which contained sweets of varying designs, colours and flavours. The packaging also contained a small comic book. This product is no longer available.

In Canada, there was a limited line of red and white Smarties where the white Smarties have an image of a red maple leaf, a reference to the Canadian flag. Holiday packaging for Halloween (sold as Scaries), Christmas and Valentine&#x27;s Day (containing only pink and red Smarties) is common. Also in Canada, Nestlé sells Peanut and Peanut Butter Smarties.

Around Christmas, Nestlé Australia and Canada often releases Smarties in the Christmas colours of red, green and white.

In other countries, like Canada, there is more variety in packaging. Smarties can be purchased in rectangular boxes, a giant tube, or in a stand-up or paper bag, and in 410 g bags in Australia and New Zealand.

In the United States, a Smarties variant was introduced by Nestlé for a limited time as part of a product promotion for Disney&#x27;s 1999 animated film, &quot;Tarzan&quot;. &quot;Tarzan Treats&quot; had red, green, brown, blue, orange and yellow Smarties pieces. Yellow pieces contained an outline graphic of characters from the film. This Smarties variant was made in Canada for distribution in the United States.

<doc id="704491" wikidata="Q4284456" url="?curid=704491" title="Mata Ortiz">
<text>Mata Ortiz is a small village in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, less than from the US-Mexico border. The community is one of the designated &quot;localidades&quot; (localities) in the &quot;municipio libre&quot; (municipality) of Casas Grandes, one of several such pueblos in a wide, fertile valley long inhabited by indigenous people. Mata Ortiz is located at the base of a mountain known as El Indio and on the west bank of the Rio Palanganas, a tributary of the Rio Casas Grandes. The ancient ruins of Casas Grandes are located nearby. As of 2010, Mata Ortiz had a population of 1,182.

==History==
The town was originally established as “Pearson” during the Porfirio Díaz presidency in the late 19th century with its economy based on agriculture, timber, cattle and the nearby railroad. After the Mexican Revolution the town’s name was changed, to honor Juan Mata Ortiz, a local hero who fought against the Apaches in the 19th century. After the Revolution was in influx of people and land was redistributed under the ejido system, but many residents still relied on seasonal labor and work with the railroad to get by. Rail work ended in the 1960s when the repair yard was relocated to Nuevo Casas Grandes, leading to the town’s decline, which continued until the 1980s.

==Ceramics==

The making of pottery in the town began in the 1980s, and now about 300 of the 2,000 inhabitants in the town make a living from making ceramics, with about two-thirds of the population having employment indirectly related to the craft, either providing fuel for kilns or offering guest rooms to traders and tourists. The handicraft has raised living standards considerably in the municipality from the poverty of the early 1980s. Before ceramics, there was only seasonal agricultural jobs for men and for women there was nothing. Pottery has allowed residents to provide things like electricity, plumbing, vehicles and more to families. The movement to create the pottery has included women as well as men since its beginning, and today women of all talent and expertise levels are found in the town.

The town is known for its ceramics which are a revival of the Paquimé tradition, conserving much of its style, decoration and color. The air is often filled with gray tendrils of smoke from the many kilns. The town has hosted a ceramics competition called the Concurso de Cerámica since 2008, now supported by FONART, and is a major handcrafts event in Mexico. Other support for artisans comes from other federal and state agency for supplies and training.

Mata Ortiz has recently seen a revival of an recontact Oasisamerica pottery tradition. Inspired by pottery from the ancient city of Paquimé, which traded as far north as New Mexico and Arizona and throughout northern Mexico, contemporary potters are producing work for national and international sale. This new artistic movement is due to the efforts of Juan Quezada Celado, the self-taught originator of modern Mata Ortiz pottery, his extended family and neighbors.

<text>The Spanish Republic (), historiographically referred to as the First Spanish Republic (), was the political regime that existed in Spain from 11 February 1873 to 29 December 1874.

The Republic&#x27;s founding ensued after the abdication of King Amadeo on 10 February 1873. On the next day a republic was proclaimed by a parliamentary majority made up of radicals, republicans and democrats. The period was beset by tensions between federal republicans and unitarian republicans. The period also saw the end of compulsory conscription, the regulation of child labor and the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. The government inherited a state of war, the so-called Third Carlist War, ongoing since 1872, and the Ten Years&#x27; War, ongoing since 1868, to which the Cantonal rebellion added up in 1873.

The January 1874 coup of Pavía ousted the government, giving way to a praetorian republic under General Serrano. In December 1874, General Arsenio Martínez Campos staged a &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; in Sagunto, which delivered the coup de grâce to the Republic and brought the Bourbon Restoration.

== Overview ==
The Constituent Cortes was called upon to write a federal constitution. The radicals preferred a unitary republic, with a much lesser role for the provinces, and once the republic had been declared the two parties turned against each other. Initially, the radicals were largely driven from power, joining those who had already been driven out by the revolution of 1868 or by the Carlist War.

The first republican attempt in the history of Spain was a short experience, characterized by profound political and social instability and violence. The Republic was governed by four distinct presidents—Estanislao Figueras, Francesc Pi i Margall, Nicolás Salmerón, Emilio Castelar; then, only eleven months after its proclamation, General Manuel Pavía led a coup d&#x27;état and established a unified republic dominated by Francisco Serrano.

The period was marked by three simultaneous civil wars: the Third Carlist War, the Cantonal Revolution, the Petroleum Revolution in Alcoy; and by the Ten Years&#x27; War in Cuba. The gravest problems for the consolidation of the regime were the lack of true republicans, their division between federalists and unitarians, and the lack of popular support. Subversion in the army, a series of local cantonalist risings, instability in Barcelona, failed anti-federalist coups, calls for revolution by the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, the lack of any broad political legitimacy, and personal in-fighting among the republican leadership all further weakened the republic.

The Republic effectively ended on 3 January 1874, when the Captain General of Madrid, Manuel Pavía, pronounced against the federalist government and called on all parties except Federalists and Carlists to form a national government. The monarchists and Republicans refused, leaving the unitary Radicals and Constitutionalists as the only group willing to govern; again a narrow political base. General Francisco Serrano formed a new government and was appointed President of the Republic although it was a mere formality since the Cortes had been dissolved.

Carlist forces managed to expand the territory under their control to the greatest extent in early 1874, though a series of defeats by the republic&#x27;s northern army in the second half of the year might have led to the end of the war had it not been for bad weather. However the other monarchists had taken the name of &quot;Alfonsists&quot; as supporters of Alfonso, the son of the former Queen Isabel, and were organised by Cánovas del Castillo.

This period of the Republic lasted until Brigadier Arsenio Martínez Campos pronounced for Alfonso in Sagunto on 29 December 1874 and the rest of the army refused to act against him. The government collapsed, leading to the end of the republic and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy with the proclamation of Alfonso XII as king.

== Proclamation of the Republic ==

King Amadeo I abdicated from the Spanish throne on 11 February 1873. His decision was mainly due to the constant difficulties he had to face during his short tenure, as the Ten Years&#x27; War, the outbreak of the Third Carlist War, the opposition from &quot;alfonsino&quot; monarchists, which hoped for the Bourbon Restoration in the person of Alfonso, son of Isabella II, the many republican insurrections and the division among his own supporters.

The Spanish Cortes, which were assembled in a joint and permanent session of both the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, declared themselves the National Assembly while waiting for any final notice from the King. The overwhelming majority was with the monarchists from the two dynastic parties that had exercised the government until then: the Radical Democratic Party of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla and the Constitutional Party of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta. There also was a small republican minority in the National Assembly, ideologically divided between federalism and centralism. One of them, Federal Democratic Republican Party member Francisco Pi y Margall moved the following proposal: &quot;The National Assembly assumes powers and declares the Republic as the form of government, leaving its organization to the Constituent Cortes.&quot;

In his speech for the proposal (to which he was a signatory, along with Figueras, Salmerón, and other opponents), Pi y Margall—himself a federalist—renounced for the moment to establish a federal republic, hoping the would-be-assembled Constituent Cortes to decide over the issue, and announced his acceptance of any other democratic decision. Then another republican, Emilio Castelar, took the floor and said:

After Castelar&#x27;s powerful speech, amidst passionate applause, the Republic was declared with a resignation of the monarchists, with 258 votes in favour and only 32 against: &quot;The National Assembly assumes all powers and declares the Republic as the form of government of Spain, leaving its organization to the Constituent Cortes. An Executive Power shall be elected directly by the Cortes, and it shall be responsible to the same.&quot;

In the same session, the first government of the Republic was elected. Federal republican Estanislao Figueras was elected the first &quot;President of the Executive Power&quot;, an office incorporating the heads of State and Government. No &quot;President of the Republic&quot; was ever elected, as the Constitution creating such office was never enacted. In his speech, Figueras said that the Republic &quot;was like a rainbow of peace and harmony of all Spaniards of good will.&quot;

The passage of these resolutions surprised and stunned most Spaniards, as the recently elected Cortes (now National Assembly) had a wide majority of monarchists. Ruiz Zorrilla spoke in these terms: &quot;I protest and will keep doing so, even if I&#x27;m left on my own, against those representatives that having come to the Cortes as constitutional monarchists feel themselves authorized to make the decision to turn the nation from monarchist to republican overnight.&quot;

For most monarchists, though, the impossibility of restoring Isabella II as Queen, and the youth of the future Alfonso XII made the Republic the only, though transitory, viable course of action, particularly given the inevitable failure that awaited it.

=== Figueras government ===
The first government of the Republic was composed of federalists and progressives who had been ministers during the monarchy. Four ministers in particular had served with King Amadeo: Echegaray (Finance), Becerra (Development), Fernández de Córdoba (War) and (Navy).

At the beginning, the government was plagued by a terrible economic situation, with a 546M peseta budgetary deficit, 153M in debts requiring immediate payment and only 32M available to fulfill them. The Artillery Corps had been dissolved in the most virulent moment of the Carlist and Cuban wars, for which there were not enough soldiers or armament, nor money to feed or purchase them. Besides, Spain was going through a deep economic crisis matching the Panic of 1873 and which was exacerbated by the political instability. In previous years, unemployment had risen steeply amongst field and industrial workers, and proletarian organizations responded with strikes, demonstrations, protest rallies and the occupation of abandoned lands.

On 23 February the newly elected Speaker of the National Assembly, radical Cristino Marcos, plotted a failed coup d&#x27;etat in which the Civil Guard occupied the Ministry of Governance and the National Militia surrounded the Congress of Deputies, in order to establish a unitary republic. This prompted the first remodeling of the government in which the progressives were ousted and replaced with federalists. Twelve days after the establishment of the Republic, compulsory military service was removed and voluntary service set up with a daily salary of 1 peseta and one crust (loaf?) of bread. A &quot;Republican volunteers&quot; corps was also established with an enlistment salary of 50 pesetas and a daily salary of 2 pesetas and 1 crust of bread.

The second Figueras government had to contend with the proclamation of a Catalan state within the Spanish republic on 9 March. The proclamation was rescinded two days later on 11 March in exchange for the dissolution of the Spanish army in Catalonia. On 23 April a new coup attempt was set in motion; this time by a collusion of &quot;alfonsino&quot; monarchists, members of the old Liberal Union and monarchic sectors of the Army; but failed when several units refrained from supporting it at the last hour.

Francisco Pi y Margall is usually considered the heart of this government, which had to face several problems already endemic to the Republic, such as the Third Carlist War, separatist insurrections (this time from Catalonia), military indiscipline, monarchic plots, etc. His government dissolved the National Assembly and summoned Constituent Cortes for 1 May. On 23 April Cristino Martos, Speaker of the old National Assembly, attempted a new coup, now supported by the Civil Governor of Madrid: a battalion of militiamen took positions along the Paseo del Prado, and four thousand more perfectly armed volunteers gathered near Independence Square under the pretext of passing review. Having heard from the plot, Pi i Margall mobilized the Civil Guard. For his part, after the Minister of War appointed Baltasar Hidalgo as the new Captain General for Madrid, he ordered Brigadier Carmona and a battalion of infantry and various artillery and cavalry units, to march on the militiamen. The coup d&#x27;état failed as soon as it started, and the government dissolved the military units participating and the Permanent Committee of the Assembly.

The writs were issued for Constituent Cortes elections on 10 May which resulted 343 seats for federal republicans and 31 for the rest of the political forces. The elections themselves developed in a quite unorthodox environment, and the resulting representation was ridiculous, as most factions in Spain did not participate: the Carlists were still waging war against the Republic, while the &quot;alfonsino&quot; monarchists of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, the unitary republicans and even the incipient workers&#x27; organization close to the First International all called for abstention. The result was clearly favourable to the federal republicans, which captured 343 of the 371 seats, but turnout was probably the lowest in Spanish history, with about 28% in Catalonia and 25% in Madrid.

== The Federal Republic ==
On 1 June 1873 the first session of the Constituent Cortes was opened and the presentation of resolutions began. The first one was debated on 7 June, written by seven representatives: &quot;First Article. The form of government of the Spanish Nation is the Democratic Federal Republic&quot;.

The president, having carried out the Cortes&#x27; regulations for the definite approval of proposal of law, arranged to hold a nominal vote the next day. The resolution was passed 8 June by a favorable vote of 219 representatives and only two against, and the Federal Republic was thus declared. Most of the federalists in parliament supported a Swiss-like confederative model, with regions directly forming independent cantons. Spanish writer Benito Pérez Galdós, aged 21 at the time, wrote about the parliamentary atmosphere of the First Republic:

The situation reached such levels of surrealism that, while presiding over a Cabinet session, Estanislao Figueras yelled: &quot;Gentlemen, I can&#x27;t stand this any more. I am going to be frank with you: I&#x27;m fed up with all of us!&quot; So fed up that on 10 June he left his resignation letter in his office, went for a walk through the and, without telling anyone, boarded the first train departing from the Atocha Station. He would only step down upon arriving in Paris.

== The government of Pi i Margall ==
After Figueras&#x27; flight to France, the power vacuum created was tempting general Manuel Sodas into starting a pronunciamiento when a Civil Guard colonel, José de la Iglesia, showed up at Congress and declared that nobody would leave until a new president was elected. Figueras&#x27; fellow federalist and government minister Francisco Pi y Margall was elected on 11 June, but on his speech to the Assembly he declared he was at a complete loss and without a program. The main efforts of the new government focused on the drafting of the new Constitution and some social character-related bills:
* Apportionment of disamortized lands among lessees, settlers and &quot;aparceros&quot;.}
* Reestablishment of the regular Army, with mandatory conscription.
* Separation of Church and State, which had been deeply intertwined under Ferdinand VII and only slightly separated by Isabella II.
* Abolition of slavery throughout the nation. Though the 1812 Cádiz Constitution had already taken some steps on the issue, the colonies remained opposed to the move from mainland Spain. Also, plans were made to limit child labor.
* Establishment of a system ensuring free and compulsory education.
* Legalization of the right of syndication, creation of mixed workers-managers juries and establishment of the 8 hours work day.

On 16 June a 25-member Committee was set up by the Cortes to study the draft Constitution of the Federal Republic of Spain, the redaction of which is mainly attributed to Emilio Castelar, with debate starting the following day. On 28 June Pi i Margall renewed the composition of his government, but due to the slow pace of the constitutional debates in the Cortes, events came crashing down on the government at a stunning pace. On 30 June the City Council of Seville passed a motion declaring the town a Social Republic, and the next day many federalist deputies left the Cortes in protest. About a week later, on 9 July, Alcoy followed suit, when during a strike directed by local leaders of the First International, the police fired to the gathered workers who responded by taking up arms and gaining control of the city. These events became known as the Petroleum Revolution.

 Shortly after, the Cantonal Rebellion swept across Spain with the federalist sentiment giving rise to several independent cantons. Uprisings were daily news in the south-eastern area of Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia. Some cantons were provincial in nature, like Valencia or Málaga, but most comprised just a city and its surroundings, like the more localised cantons of Alcoy, Cartagena, Seville, Cádiz, Almansa, Torrevieja, Castellón, Granada, Salamanca, Bailén, Andújar, Tarifa and Algeciras. Even smaller were the village-based cantons of Camuñas (in Albacete) and Jumilla (in Murcia). The latter is said to have issued a manifesto stating:

There is, however, no record of such a manifesto, nor of any similar declaration, in the municipal archives; and the proceedings of the time seemed to be within normality. This has motivated several historians to deny the authenticity of the manifesto and even the very existence of the Jumilla canton, stating that its invention was merely a form of anti-republican propaganda.

The most active – and known – of the cantons was the Canton of Cartagena, its autonomy declared on 12 July at the city naval base under the inspiration of the federalist congressman Antonio Gálvez Arce, known as &quot;Antonete&quot;. The Canton of Cartagena would live six months of constant wars, and even minted its own currency, the &quot;duro cantonal&quot;.

The first deed of the Cartagenan cantonalists was the capture of the Saint Julian castle, which motivated a strange telegram sent by the city&#x27;s captain-general to the Minister of the Navy: &quot;Saint Julian castle shows Turkish flag&quot;. Such &quot;Turkish flag&quot; was in fact the cantonal flag, the first red flag in Spanish history (the Ottoman Civil Ensign was a plain red flag, hence the captain-general&#x27;s terminology). Gálvez&#x27;s passionate speeches allowed him to gain control of the Navy ships docked in the city, which at that time were among the best in the Spanish Navy. Under his command, the fleet wreaked havoc on the nearby Mediterranean shore, causing the Madrid government to declare him a pirate and set a bounty on his head. Back on land, he led an expedition towards Madrid that was defeated at Chinchilla.

Two cantonal frigates, the &quot;Almansa&quot; and the &quot;Vitoria&quot;, set sail towards a &quot;foreign power&quot; (the Spanish city of Almería) for fund-raising. As the city would not pay, it was bombarded and taken by the cantonalists. General Contreras, commanding officer of the cantonal fleet, ordered the Marcha Real to be played as he unboarded. Afterwards, the deed would be repeated in Alicante, but on the trip back to Cartagena they were captured as pirates by the armoured frigates HMS Swiftsure and SMS Friedrich Karl, under the UK and German flags respectively.

An even worse problem was the Third Carlist War, in which the rebels controlled most of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia without opposition, and sent raid parties throughout the Peninsula. The Carlist pretender, Charles VII, had formed a rival government in Estella with his own ministers and was already minting currency, while the French connivance allowed him to receive external aid and fortify his defences. Between the Carlists and the cantonal revolution, the actual territory in which the short-lived Republic exerted undisputed authority did not extend much further than the province of Madrid itself and North-Western Spain, as cantonal uprisings took place as far north as Ávila.

Due to the rapid pace of the events, and without time for the new Constitution to be passed by the Cortes, Pi i Margall found himself between a rock and the proverbial hard place of the cantonal revolution. However, the effective Commander in Chief of the Republic rejected all calls, from both military and political instances, to exert repression on the cantonal uprisings, as he argued they were just following his very own doctrine. Thus, he was forced to resign on 18 July after just 37 days in office. He would later sorely describe his experience as premier:
==Drafting the Federal Constitution==
The draft of the Federal Constitution of the First Republic of Spain developed at length into 117 articles organized under 17 titles.

In the first article, the following is found:
Composing the Spanish Nation the states of Andalucía Alta, Andalucía Baja, Aragón, Asturias, Baleares, Canarias, Castilla la Nueva, Castilla la Vieja, Cataluña, Cuba, Extremadura, Galicia, Murcia, Navarra, Puerto Rico, Valencia, Regiones Vascongadas. The states will be able to conserve the actual provinces and modify them, according to their territorial necessities.
These states would have &quot;complete economic-administrative autonomy and political autonomy compatible with the existence of the nation&quot; such as &quot;the ability to give it a political constitution&quot; (articles 92 and 93).

The constitutional draft anticipated in Title IV—in addition to the classic Legislative Power, Executive Power and Judicial Power—a fourth Relational Power that would be exercised by the president of the Republic.

Legislative Power would be in the hands of the Federal Cortes, which would be composed of the Congress and the Senate. Congress was to be a house of proportional representation with one representative &quot;for every 50,000 souls&quot;, renewing every two years. The Senate was to be a house of territorial representation, four senators being elected by the Cortes of each one of the states.

Executive Power would be exercised by the Ministry of Advisors, whose president would be elected by the president of the republic.

Article 40 of the draft stated: &quot;In the political organization of the Spanish nation, all things individual are the pure domain of the individual; all things municipal are that of the municipality; all things regional are that of the state; and all things national, of the Federation.&quot; The following article declared that &quot;All powers are elective, revocable, and accountable&quot;, and Article 42 that &quot;Sovereignty resides in all citizens, which they exercise by their own representation by the political organizations of the Republic, constituted through universal suffrage.&quot;

Judicial Power would reside in the Federal Supreme Court, which would be composed &quot;of three magistrates for each state of the federation&quot; (Article 73) that would never be elected by the Executive Power or the Legislative Power. It also would establish that all courts would be profession and the judicial institution for all classes of representatives.

Relational Power would be exercised by the president of the Federal Republic whose mandate would last &quot;four years, not being immediately reeligible&quot;, as says Article 81 of the draft.

== The government of Nicolás Salmerón ==
After accepting the resignation of Pi i Margall, Nicolás Salmerón was elected president of the Executive Power, with 119 votes in favor and 93 votes against.

The new president, who was a moderate federalist republican, defended the necessity of arriving at an understanding with the more moderate or conservative groups and a slow transition toward a federal republic. His oratory was crushing: Francisco Silvela said that in his speeches, Salmerón only used one weapon—artillery. Antonio Maura characterized the professorial tone of Don Nicolás, saying that &quot;it always seemed that he was addressing the metaphysicists of Albacete.&quot;

Already during his stints as Minister of Mercy and Justice in the government of Estanislao Figueras, he brought about the abolition of the death penalty, even the independence of judicial power in the face of the political.

His nomination produced an intensification of the cantonal movement, which to control he had to resort to generals openly against the Federal Republic, sending military expeditions to Andalucía and Valencia under the respective command of generals Pavía and Martínez Campos. One after another the separate cantons were subdued, except that of Cartagena, which resisted until 12 January 1874.

His generals asked the &quot;awareness&quot; of the government and his signature to execute various death sentences on various deserting soldiers on the Carlist front; according to them, this was essential to reestablishing discipline on the army. Salmerón, man of very advanced liberal principles, declined to concede the &quot;awareness&quot; and, as is written on the wall of his mausoleum, &quot;abandoned power to not sign a death sentence.&quot; In this way, he resigned on 6 September.

== The government of Emilio Castelar ==
The next day, 7 September, the man elected to occupy the presidency of the Executive Power was unitarian Emilio Castelar, professor of History and distinguished orator, by 133 votes in favor against the 67 obtained by Pi y Margall. During his previous time as Minister of State in the government of Estanislao Figueras, Castelar promoted and achieved the approval of the abolition of slavery in the overseas territory of Puerto Rico, although not in Cuba because of the continuing war situation. This act by the First Spanish Republic is commemorated in Puerto Rico up to the present day.

Motivated by the difficult situation through which the Republic was passing, with the aggravation of the Carlist War, Emilio Castelar commenced the reorganization of the army, announcing before the Cortes &quot;to sustain this form of government, I need much infantry, much cavalry, much artillery, much Civil Guard, and many riflemen.&quot; In spite of the federalist opposition, the Cortes conceded to him extraordinary powers to govern, after which they closed the Cortes on 20 September. He confirmed the death sentences that provoked the resignation of his predecessor, reestablished order, and was at the point of surrendering to the cantonalists of Cartagena.

Without doubt, the chaos incited by the cantonal revolt and the worsening of the Carlist War led them to reopen the Cortes on 2 January 1874, in order to bring to a vote the management and ask for unlimited powers with which to save the Republic from complete discredit.

In effect, the Cortes session opened on 2 January 1874, but the federalists rose up against Don Emilio Castelar, who was supported by the captain general of Madrid, Don Manuel Pavía, former supporter of Prim, with whom he had rebelled in Villarejo de Salvanés. Two very different forces threatened to interrupt the deliberations of the Cortes: the federalists, eager to finish Castelar with mighty wrath, and the troops of General Pavía, supporter of Castelar, who had decided to show up in his support to avoid his defeat before the federalists.

The committed regiments had already left at the captain general&#x27;s orders when the Cortes recognized Castelar&#x27;s defeat by 119 votes against 101. The former president of the Republic, and the president of the Cortes, Nicolás Salmerón, called for a new vote to elect a new chief of the Executive Power.

Pavía situated himself in front of the building with his staff and ordered two adjutants to impose upon Salmerón the dissolution of the Cortes session and the evacuation of the building in five minutes. The Civil Guard, which guarded the Congress, put into action the general&#x27;s orders and occupied the halls of Congress (without entering the floor). It was 6:55 in the morning, when the vote to elect the federalist candidate Eduardo Palance was proceeding, and Salmerón, upon receiving the captain general&#x27;s order, suspended the vote and communicated the grave situation to the representatives. The representatives abandoned the building with all speed, amidst scenes of exaggerated hysterics; some even threw themselves out the windows. Pavía, surprised, asked: &quot;But gentlemen, Why jump out the windows when you can leave through the door?&quot;

Pavía, who was a unitarian republican, offered to allow Emilio Castelar to continue in the presidency, but he refused, not wanting to maintain power through undemocratic means. These acts signified the unofficial end of the First Republic, although it officially continued for almost a year.

== The unitary republic ==
At the same time as the political convulsions were taking place, General López Domínguez entered into Cartagena on 12 January, replacing Martínez Campos, while Antonete Gálvez, with more than a thousand men, struggled to elude him near the border of Numancia &quot;(Numantia)&quot; and set course for Oran, (Algeria). The end of the cantonal experience was marked by Gálvez with his exile, but the Bourbon Restoration permitted him through amnesty to return to his native Torreagüera. In this period he would strike up a strange and warm friendship with Don Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, most responsible for the Restoration, who considered Gálvez a sincere, honorable, and valiant man, although one of exaggerated political ideas.

Meanwhile, after Emilio Castelar&#x27;s refusal to continue as president, he put General Serrano, recently returned from his exile in Biarritz for his implication in the attempted coup of 23 April, in charge of the formation of a coalition government that grouped together monarchists, conservatives, and unitarian republicans, but excluded federalist republicans.

Francisco Serrano, Duke of Torre, 63 years old, former collaborator of Isabel II, had already twice freed the leadership of the state. He proclaimed the Unitary Republic, taking control of the presidency of the Executive Power, and dispensing with the Cortes in a conservative republican dictatorship. During his mandate he once and for all subdued the cantonal insurrections, and that of Cartagena, and concentrated his forces on the Carlist War in the north of Spain. The general attempted without success to consolidate power to himself in dictatorship form, following the example of the regime of dukes and generals that prevailed in France upon the fall of Napoleon III and after the defeat of the Paris Commune.

In just a few months, on 13 May, Serrano ceded the presidency of the government to Juan de Zavala y de la Puente to personally take control of the operations against the Carlists in the north. Práxedes Mateo Sagasta took charge of the government on 3 September. On 10 December the siege of Pamplona began, but it was interrupted by the Proclamation of Sagunto.

== The end of the Republic ==
On 29 December 1874 in Sagunto, General Arsenio Martínez Campos came out in favour of the restoration to the throne of the Bourbon monarchy in the personage of Don Alfonso de Borbón, son of Isabel II. The government of Sagasta did not oppose this announcement, permitting the restoration of the monarchy. The triumph of the Bourbon Restoration succeeded thanks to the previous work of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, which without a doubt was contrary to military rule.

Until 1931, the Spanish republicans celebrated the 11 February anniversary of the First Republic. Thereafter, the commemoration was moved to 14 April, the anniversary of the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1931.

<text>KSL-TV (channel 5) is a television station in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is the flagship television property of locally based Bonneville International, the for-profit broadcasting arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and is sister to radio stations KSL (1160 AM) and KSL-FM (102.7). The three stations share studios at the Broadcast House building in Salt Lake City&#x27;s Triad Center; KSL-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains, southwest of Salt Lake City. The station has a large network of broadcast translators that extend its over-the-air coverage throughout Utah, as well as portions of Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.

KSL-TV is one of a few for-profit U.S. television stations owned by a religious institution (most U.S. TV stations owned by religious institutions are affiliated with non-profit religious broadcasting networks).

==History==
===Primary CBS affiliate===
The station first signed on the air on June 1, 1949, operating from studios in the Union Pacific Building on Main Street. It was owned by the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, who also owned KSL radio (1160 AM and 100.3 FM, now KSFI). It originally operated as a CBS affiliate, owing to its sister radio station&#x27;s longtime affiliation with the CBS Radio Network. In addition to its primary CBS affiliation, the station also shared ABC programming with NBC affiliate KDYL-TV (channel 4, now KTVX). The two stations continued to share ABC programming until KUTV (channel 2) signed on in September 1954 as the market&#x27;s full-time ABC affiliate. The station also broadcast some programming from the DuMont Television Network, and during the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

A few months after its sign-on, KSL moved its operations to studio facilities at the Broadcast House on Social Hall Avenue. In 1952, a transmission tower was constructed on Farnsworth Peak to improve the station&#x27;s signal coverage along the Wasatch Front and into Tooele County. It also began building a massive translator network that eventually stretched across five states.

When KSL first began broadcasting, all programs were produced locally or recorded content from out of the area (such as delayed Kinescope recordings). This changed in 1951, when AT&amp;T completed their coast-to-coast microwave relay network allowing the station to tap into live television feeds from its affiliated networks. KSL first broadcast live network programming on September 30, 1951, with a broadcast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Goodyear Revue&quot;. Prior to this, KSL had been producing 40 live shows weekly.

The KSL stations operated as a division of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; until 1964, when Bonneville International was formed as the parent company for the LDS Church&#x27;s broadcasting holdings. Soon afterward, channel 5 began broadcasting its programming in color. In 1984, the station moved to its current facility at Triad Center, also named Broadcast House.

===Switch to NBC affiliate===

In July 1994, CBS and Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) agreed to a long-term affiliation deal for the five Group W television stations, including longtime NBC affiliate KYW-TV in Philadelphia. That November, NBC agreed to trade their O&amp;O stations KCNC-TV and KUTV (which was acquired by NBC earlier that year) to CBS in return for CBS&#x27; former O&amp;O in Philadelphia, WCAU-TV, as a result of a complex ownership deal between the network, Westinghouse and NBC. NBC also traded their VHF channel 4 frequency and transmitter in Miami (then home to WTVJ) to CBS in exchange for the channel 6 frequency in Miami (then home to WCIX, which subsequently became WFOR-TV). The deal took effect on September 10, 1995, resulting in the first network affiliation switch in Salt Lake City since KTVX swapped affiliations with KUTV and became an ABC affiliate in 1960. Initially, NBC sought to reaffiliate with KTVX; but after that station renewed its affiliation agreement with ABC, NBC then secured an affiliation deal with KSL-TV. KUTV continued to air one NBC program, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, for five more months until January 1996, when it was moved to then-WB affiliate KOOG-TV (now CW owned-and-operated station KUCW).

On January 14, 1999, a shooter entered the station&#x27;s Broadcast House facility, allegedly looking for a KSL-TV reporter. Anne Sleater, an employee of another company that was housed in the building, AT&amp;T Wireless Services, was shot during the incident and later died from her injuries. De-Kieu Duy, a 24-year-old female, was arrested in connection with the shooting. Duy was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial and is currently housed in the Utah State Hospital.

In 2002, Bruce Christensen was named the president of KSL-TV; Christensen was a former president of PBS, the former dean of the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications, as well as a former KSL-TV reporter. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, KSL-TV was very influential in bringing coverage and technology to NBC. The station heavily lobbied to NBC that the Games be broadcast live locally.

In July 2010, KSL-TV entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with independent station KJZZ-TV (channel 14), after the LMA between that station and KUTV concluded after five years; the LMA was terminated in 2016, after KUTV&#x27;s owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, purchased KJZZ.

==Programming==
In addition to locally produced news and sports programs, and syndicated shows, KSL broadcasts most of the programs seen on NBC&#x27;s schedule.

Due to its ties to the LDS Church, KSL-TV also airs programs relevant to Mormonism, such as &quot;History of the Saints&quot;, &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; and &quot;Mormon Times&quot;, and preempts regularly scheduled programming to carry the twice yearly LDS General Conference. KSL-TV is one of the few remaining television stations in the United States that still &quot;signs off&quot; at night (though only nominally, because programming immediately continues afterward), doing so at 3:30 a.m. on Sundays.

===Program preemptions and deferrals===
Historically, KSL-TV has been known to occasionally preempt or assign out-of-pattern scheduling to certain network programs, either to make room for other local or syndicated programs or because of internal concerns over subject matter that station management deems objectionable, typically due to conflicts with to longstanding LDS Church beliefs. (Many of these preempted programs have aired instead on KUCW (channel 30) or KMYU (channel 12) over the years.) Preemptions based on content objections have periodically led to inquiries over the sustainability of a religious institution owning a network-affiliated station as content standards and practices in broadcast television have relaxed in recent decades in a reflection of cultural change.

As a CBS affiliate, in 1977, &quot;Match Game&quot; host Gene Rayburn mentioned that the often risque then-CBS daytime game show was not being aired in Salt Lake City. In 1987, the station was among several affiliates that announced that it would not air the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; ahead of its originally scheduled premiere amid criticism from parental organizations over concerns about the show&#x27;s violent content and humor ridiculing the handicapped and the perceived likelihood of it merely being a program-length ad for the controversial namesake toys and trading cards. (Amid the controversy, CBS elected not to air it in the U.S., though its distribution arm syndicated it in some international markets.) In the years leading to its switch to NBC, KSL also preempted the 1989–91 sitcom &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; (partway into its third and final season in November 1990), and three shorter-lived series—&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (in 1988), prime time soap opera &quot;2000 Malibu Road&quot; and adult-oriented sitcom &quot;Grapevine&quot; (both in 1992)—because of their sexual content. KSL removed &quot;Picket Fences&quot; midway through its first season, partly due to objections over a January 1993 episode (&quot;Nuclear Meltdowns&quot;) centering on a teenage girl who becomes pregnant through an incestuous plural marriage with a polygamist Mormon and the perpetrator&#x27;s allusion that, although plural marriage within the LDS Church ceased after the 1890 Manifesto (issued in response to Congressional acts to disincorporate and seize assets of the church over the practice), many Mormons still held polygamist beliefs. The drama series returned to KSL in its normal network time slot in April 1993, before being shifted to a one-day delay at 11 p.m. Saturdays for its second season in September 1993. The station refused CBS&#x27; late night &quot;Crimetime After Primetime&quot; block from September 1990 until its discontinuation after the August 1993 premiere of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (though this was based more on retaining local control of its late night schedule than over content concerns after the failure of the preceding &quot;Pat Sajak Show&quot;), and preempted the network&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s program lineup after September 1989. It also was among several Mountain Time CBS stations that aired &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and its predecessors on a one-hour-ahead basis (from 6 to 8 a.m.) until it shifted the morning show in-pattern in September 1994 to accommodate an expanded (and relocated, as it was moved up two hours to 6 a.m.) local morning newscast.

As an NBC affiliate, KSL declined to air &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; throughout its first 18 years with the network; despite this, between 1995 and 2013, the station carried all of the long-running sketch comedy&#x27;s &quot;best-of&quot; compilations, actor tributes, documentary specials and Saturday evening repeats that NBC aired in prime time. Unlike most of the later preemptions, while potentially objectionable content in the series were somewhat an issue for the station (NBC rebuffed KSL management inquiries about delaying &quot;SNL&quot; to midnight), the decision was largely made to retain its popular local sports discussion and highlight program &quot;SportsBeat Saturday&quot;. &quot;SNL&quot; initially remained on KUTV under arrangement with CBS until January 1996, before moving to then-WB affiliate KOOG (now KUCW). In June 2013, KSL announced that it would start airing &quot;SNL&quot; in its regular timeslot beginning that fall, after revealing that viewership for &quot;SportsBeat&quot; had declined in recent years (and was also being beaten by the similar KUTV program &quot;Talkin&#x27; Sports&quot; in its slot); the Utah Utes playing more later evening games against West Coast opponents following its 2011 shift to the Pac-12 Conference from the Mountain West Conference (which played most of its football games in the afternoon) had also made it difficult for &quot;SportsBeat&quot; to analyze, carry, and package highlights of games that were often still in progress as it aired. KSL-TV also did not air the 1997–99 NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;; the soap was seen locally on KOOG instead.

Content-wise, Channel 5 declined the short-lived 2003 sitcom &quot;Coupling&quot; because of its sexual humor and content, and preempted much of NBC&#x27;s poker programming (such as &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; throughout its 2007–11 run) due to Church, ownership and LDS-member viewers&#x27; objections toward gambling. In September 2011, KSL-TV also preempted &quot;The Playboy Club&quot; (replacing it with the locally produced newsmagazine &quot;We Are Utah&quot;), on grounds that the fledgling drama was &quot;completely inconsistent&quot; with the station&#x27;s mission and branding, not wanting to be associated with the Playboy brand, even though the program did not specifically focus on the magazine nor include any nudity. (KSL sponsors &quot;Out in the Light&quot;, a campaign aimed at educating Utahns on mental, marital and sociological issues associated with viewing pornographic material.) The program aired on KMYU in its Monday 9 p.m. time slot until it was canceled by NBC after its third episode. KSL continued to air already-recorded episodes of &quot;We Are Utah&quot; in the 9 p.m. slot until the October 31, 2011, premiere of &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;. On August 24, 2012, KSL-TV preempted &quot;The New Normal&quot; (replacing it with the Live Well Network series &quot;My Family Recipe Rocks!&quot;) on a Tuesday timeslot due to objections to the sitcom&#x27;s storyline surrounding gay parenting, crude dialogue and potentially offensive characterizations. KUCW ran &quot;The New Normal&quot; instead in a Saturday night slot. In a twist, although the show was canceled after its first season in May 2013, &quot;The New Normal&quot; was the first NBC prime time show that KSL has declined to air since it joined the network in 1995 (and the first prime time network show to have been preempted by Channel 5 since &quot;Picket Fences&quot;) that lasted at least a full season. (Other prime time series declined by the station for objectionable content have, by coincidence due to insufficient national viewership, been among the network&#x27;s initial cancellation orders during their debut seasons.)

On April 29, 2013, KSL-TV pulled &quot;Hannibal&quot; after four episodes, due to the drama&#x27;s graphic violent content and material revolving around the Hannibal Lecter series of novels and films, an action compared by executive producer Bryan Fuller to how Russian newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; structured its news coverage to fit the Soviet Communist Party&#x27;s narrative. KUCW aired the program on Saturday nights (initially following &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, before moving to 11 p.m. for the show&#x27;s second season), while &quot;Hannibal&quot;″s regular timeslot was occupied on Channel 5 by the weekly newsmagazine &quot;KSL In Depth&quot;. &quot;Hannibal&quot; was cancelled after its last episode in August 2015, and the station cleared NBC&#x27;s entire seasonal prime time schedule for the first time in the 2015–16 season. 

On September 4, 2013, KSL announced it was moving &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; out of daytime to 1:05 a.m., leading out of the network&#x27;s late-night talk lineup, effective September 9; a local lifestyle program replaced &quot;Days&quot; in its former 2 p.m. slot (one of the alternate timeslots that NBC assigned for affiliates to air the soap opera). Other than the plausible outcome that locally originated programming in the daytime hour could allow KSL to attain much more ad revenue with a local program, no reason for the move was explicitly stated, with a common theory floated for the move being a storyline involving openly gay characters Will Horton and Sonny Kiriakis (who later became the first gay couple to be legally married in-canon on a network soap opera), citing historical opposition within the LDS Church to same-sex relationships. It also gave the show a steady DVR-friendly timeslot, where its preemption by breaking news in an overnight timeslot was much rarer than it would be in the afternoon, reducing overall station complaints. The latter reason is much more likely, as KSL continued to air &quot;Days&quot; in late night until the series moved exclusively to the Peacock streaming service (owned by NBC parent Comcast) in September 2022, even with the subsequent &quot;killing off&quot; and &quot;resurrection&quot; of Will in the series, and Sonny and Will&#x27;s summer 2020 departure from the show. The NBC News Now-produced afternoon newscast &quot;NBC News Daily&quot;—which replaced &quot;Days&quot; on NBC&#x27;s schedule upon the soap&#x27;s shift to Peacock—was not carried by KSL during the 2022–23 season, due to existing timeslot commitments to air &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; and &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;; it began clearing the program (airing at 1 p.m. weekdays) in September 2023, after the two syndicated talk shows ended their runs. (KSL began airing the network&#x27;s overnight rebroadcast of NBC News Now&#x27;s &quot;Top Story with Tom Llamas&quot; the season before in the timeslot vacated by &quot;Days&quot;.)

Even with its tradition of screening possibly objectionable programs, some, such as &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot; (which was not shown by several other NBC affiliates, especially in Bible Belt states) and a paid political message criticizing the Iraq War (which featured Cindy Sheehan) have been aired by the station.

===Sports programming===
Owing to NBC&#x27;s longstanding contract with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), KSL-TV was the local broadcaster of the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City. As host city, NBC excluded KSL from its long-time mandate that its Olympics telecasts be tape delayed on the West Coast (a policy that applied for all other stations, even though the Games were being held in a time zone only an hour ahead of Pacific Time).

The station also aired Utah Jazz games selected for national broadcast, first through CBS Sports from the team&#x27;s move to Salt Lake City in 1979 until 1990, then NBC Sports from 1995 to 2002. The NBC years saw two Jazz appearances in the NBA Finals (1997 and 1998), both ending in losses to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.

===News operation===

KSL-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). Despite its roots in the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and its link to KSL radio, channel 5 was initially an also-ran in news. That changed in 1965, when the station poached sportscaster Paul James (better known as the voice of BYU football and basketball) and weatherman Bob Welti from KCPX-TV and teamed them with anchor Dick Nourse. Within a few months, channel 5 had rocketed into first place. It would be the dominant news station in Utah for most of the next 45 years, garnering some of the highest ratings in the country. Nourse, James and Welti would remain together until 1991, with Nourse staying on as top anchorman until 2007. In 2008, KSL-TV became the second television station in the Salt Lake City market (after KUTV, which converted in April of that year) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. For a long time, the station&#x27;s newscasts were branded as &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;; the name was scrapped in 2009 in favor of &quot;KSL 5 News&quot;, and is now known simply as &quot;KSL News&quot;.

In November 2010, KUTV, long a distant runner-up, unseated KSL-TV in most timeslots, though channel 5 remained ahead at 10 p.m. However, in February 2011, KSL-TV lost the lead at 10 p.m. for the first time in recent memory. In December 2011, KSL-TV restored its lead in every time slot in the Nielsen ratings except one—the early morning news slot on weekdays (in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic), where the station finished in third place. Since then, however, KSL-TV has dropped back to a distant runner-up behind KUTV in most time slots. According to media observers, channel 5&#x27;s ratings slumped after Mark Willes became president of Deseret Management Corporation, the for-profit arm of the LDS Church and Bonneville&#x27;s parent company, and abandoned the station&#x27;s longtime focus on hard news in favor of &quot;values-based&quot; reporting. Willes was fired in 2012, but the station&#x27;s ratings have yet to recover.

It has used the slogan, &quot;News Specialists&quot; or &quot;The News Specialists&quot; in some variation or form since at least the 1980s, while still affiliated with CBS.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
On January 1, 2009, KSL ended its affiliation with NBC Weather Plus on its 5.3 subchannel due to the service&#x27;s discontinuation by NBC, and relaunched the subchannel as a locally compiled automated weather channel, the &quot;Live 5 Weather Channel&quot;, which was one of the first local digital weather subchannels in the country to be presented in 480i widescreen. KSL-TV also carried Universal Sports on its 5.2 subchannel until it began to be exclusively distributed through cable and satellite television in January 2012; it was replaced by Live Well Network in 2013. On January 1, 2014, KSL replaced Live Well Network with Cozi TV on digital subchannel 5.2.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSL-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using virtual channel 5. As part of the SAFER Act, KSL-TV kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

Effective September 17, 2018, the station moved its digital signal from channel 38 to channel 23, as part of the broadcast spectrum repacking.
