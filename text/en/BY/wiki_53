<text>The Late Jurassic is the third epoch of the Jurassic Period, and it spans the geologic time from 161.5 ± 1.0 to 143.1 ± 0.8 million years ago (Ma), which is preserved in Upper Jurassic strata.

In European lithostratigraphy, the name &quot;Malm&quot; indicates rocks of Late Jurassic age. In the past, &quot;Malm&quot; was also used to indicate the unit of geological time, but this usage is now discouraged to make a clear distinction between lithostratigraphic and geochronologic/chronostratigraphic units.

==Subdivisions==
The Late Jurassic is divided into three ages, which correspond with the three (faunal) stages of Upper Jurassic rock:
==Paleogeography==

During the Late Jurassic Epoch, Pangaea broke up into two supercontinents, Laurasia to the north, and Gondwana to the south. The result of this break-up was the spawning of the Atlantic Ocean. However, at this time, the Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow.

==Life forms==
This epoch is well known for many famous types of dinosaurs, such as the sauropods, the theropods, the thyreophorans, and the ornithopods. Other animals, such as some crocodylomorphs and the first birds, appeared in the Jurassic. Listed here are only a few of the many Jurassic animals:
:*&quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, a large herbivorous sauropod dinosaur from North America
:*&quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, a large herbivorous sauropod dinosaur from North America
:*&quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, a massive herbivorous sauropod dinosaur from North America

<doc id="708222" wikidata="Q1146624" url="?curid=708222" title="Ilya Muromets">
<text>Ilya Muromets or Murometz, also known as Ilya of Murom, is a bogatyr in &quot;byliny&quot; set during the time of Kievan Rus&#x27;. He is often featured alongside fellow bogatyrs Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich, the three collectively known in Russian culture as &quot;&quot;.

Attempts have been made to identify a possible historical nucleus for the character. The main candidate is , a 12th-century monk in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra who was canonized in 1643. His relics are preserved in the monastery.

==Ilya in &quot;byliny&quot;==
Ilya Muromets is a major figure in &quot;byliny&quot;, a type of Russian epic folklore collected in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The son of a peasant, Ilya was born in the village of Karacharovo, near Murom. He suffered a serious illness in his youth and was unable to walk until the age of 33. He could only lie on a Russian stove, until he was miraculously healed by two pilgrims. He was then given super-human strength by a dying knight, Svyatogor, and set out to liberate the city of Kiev from Idolishche to serve Vladimir I of Kiev. Along the way, he single-handedly defended the city of Chernigov from nomadic invasion (possibly by the Polovtsi) and was offered knighthood by the local ruler, but Ilya declined to stay. In the forests of Bryansk, he then killed the forest-dwelling monster known as Nightingale the Robber (&quot;Solovei-Razboinik&quot;), who murdered travelers with his powerful whistle.

In Kiev, Ilya was made the chief bogatyr by Vladimir and he defended the country from numerous attacks by the steppe people, including of the Tatars. Generous and simple-minded but also temperamental, Ilya once went on a rampage and destroyed all the church steeples in Kiev after Vladimir failed to invite him to a celebration. He was soon appeased when Vladimir sent for him.

==Ilya Pechersky==
Some suggest that his prototype was , a 12th-century monk in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra who was born in Karacharovo, near Murom, and canonized in 1643. According to hagiography, before taking his monastic vows, Ilya Pechersky was a warrior famous for his strength. His nickname was &quot;Chobotok&quot;, meaning &quot;(small) boot&quot;, given to him after an incident when Ilya Pechersky, caught by surprise, fought off enemies with only his boot.

In 1988, Soviet archeologists exhumed Ilya Pechersky&#x27;s remains, which were stored in the monastery, and studied them. Their report suggested that at least some parts of the legend may be true: the man was tall, and his bones carried signs of spinal disease at early age and marks from numerous wounds, one of which was fatal.

==Legendary status ==

His character probably does not represent a unique historical persona, but rather a fusion of multiple real or fictional heroes from vastly different epochs. Thus, Ilya supposedly served Vladimir I of Kiev (); he fought Batu Khan, the founder of the Golden Horde (); he saved &quot;Constantine the God-Loving&quot;, the tsar of Constantinople, from a monster (there were a number of Byzantine emperors named Constantine, one of them a contemporary of Vladimir I, named Constantine VIII (); it could also be a reference to Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (), who encountered Olga of Kiev in the 950s; but the one emperor in Constantinople with this name most likely to be called &quot;God-loving&quot; was Constantine XI, ).

==Analysis==
The cycle of tales around Ilya Muromets (including the fight against villainous Nightingale the Robber and monster Idolishche) is classified under its own type in the East Slavic Folktale Classification (): SUS -650C*, , closely placed with other tale types about strong heroes. The East Slavic Classification registers variants from Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian sources.

<text>Mimi Parent (born Marie Parent; September 8, 1924June 14, 2005) was a Canadian surrealist artist. For many years she lived and worked in Paris, France. Her art is known for its symbolism, and the metaphorical use of existing objects, including human hair.

==Early life==

Marie Parent was born in Montreal, Canada. She was the eighth of the nine children of architect Lucien Parent. Between 1942 and 1947 she studied art at the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal where she met her future husband, fellow art student Jean Benoît. While she was there, she studied under Alfred Pellan who influenced Parent&#x27;s work. It was noted by some that she was an unruly student. Parent was later expelled from the school after joining a controversial artists&#x27; group, called Prisme d’yeux.

==Career==
In Canada, Parent identified with the Surrealist movement, as well as automatism. In 1959 she became a member of the Paris Surrealist Group. Parent associated with other surrealist artists, such as Andre Breton and Marcel Duchamp. Parent participated in the International Surrealist Exhibition, devoted to Eros. During 1964–1967, Parent made Anti-Gaullist posters, and she was involved in protests in Paris in May 1968. Parent illustrated books for Guy Cabanel and Jose Pierre.

Parent was most known for her 3D tableaux boxes. In these boxes, Parent would include figures and elements relating to mythology, folklore, and her unconscious imagination. Parent often incorporated elements of lunar and solar forces, representing masculinity and femininity. Parent was raised in a Catholic household, and her work showed influences of her faith and eroticism. Parent incorporated materials such as human hair, in her art objects. One of her well known pieces &quot;Maitresse&quot;, 1996, was a whip, with the lash being composed of two braids of her hair.

In 1947, she had her first one-woman exhibition at the Dominion Gallery in Montreal which received praise from &quot;Time&quot;.

In 1948, she received the Cézanne medal. That year, she married Benoit, and the two moved to Paris. On December 2, 1959, she participated in Jean Benoit&#x27;s performance, &quot;L’Execution du testament du marquis de Sade&quot;, a ceremony in which Benoit brands the letters SADE in his chest while dressed with accessories representing Eros and Thanatos. This ceremony established the two as centers of the Parisian surrealist group, led by Andre Breton. Between 1964 and 1967, they participated together in many soirees at the &quot;Le Ranelagh&quot; theatre in Paris, and in 1965, exhibited at the “L’Ecart absolu” exposition. She exhibited at the &quot;Surrealist intrusion into the Enchanter&#x27;s Domain&quot; in New York in 1960 and in 1966 had a solo exhibition at the &quot;Maya&quot; gallery in Brussels. She also exhibited in Chicago, London, Lausanne and Frankfurt. She assisted with the organization of the &quot;Exposition inteRnatiOnale du Surréalisme&quot; (EROS), which ran in Paris from December 1959 to the following February; although this is often attributed to Duchamp, she came up with the ideas for the exhibit catalogue, titled &quot;Boite Alerte – Missives Lascives&quot;, which was presented as a green box into which ideas could be &#x27;posted&#x27;.

Parent lived and worked in Paris, France and continued creating art in her later years. Following Andre Breton&#x27;s death and the Paris Surrealist Group&#x27;s disbandment, Parent went on to create what she referred to as “picture objects”. These included a mix between found objects sculptures and paintings. Then, her art medium turned to ink drawings. She had many solo exhibitions throughout her life (Galerie André-François Petit, Paris, 1984; Museum Bochum, 1984; Noyers-sur-Serein, 1992) and was active as an artist until the end of her days. Her most notable shows included &quot;Femininmasculin&quot;, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1995, &quot;La femme Et Le Surrealisme&quot;, in Lausanne in 1987, &quot;Surrealism: Desire Unbound&quot;, at the Tate Modern in London in 2001 and &quot;Paris And The Surrealists&quot;, in Barcelona in 2005. In the fall of 1998, Galerie 1900–2000 in Paris organized a retrospective of her work and in 2004, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec held a retrospective in which she and Jean Benoit were the subjects. She died June 14, 2005, in Switzerland and her ashes were scattered by Benoît at Château de Lacoste, the estate of the Marquis de Sade in Haute-Provence.

<text>Richmond Creek is a major stream in Staten Island, New York City. Its upper drainage basin includes the remote forested hills in the center of the island. It empties into the Fresh Kills.

Its source is Ohrbach Lake, located on the grounds of the Pouch Camp, maintained by the Boy Scouts of America. From there, it enters the Greenbelt, crossing underneath the intersection of Manor Road and Rockland Avenue. It enters the Egbertville Ravine, then emerges from the ravine and flows along the east side of Lighthouse Hill. There, it skims the western edge of the Richmondtown neighborhood and through Historic Richmond Town. South of Richmondtown, it emerges into a wide floodplain that has been designated as part of Staten Island&#x27;s Bluebelt, a region of protected wetlands. It flows under Richmond Avenue south of the Staten Island Mall, and flows into the Fresh Kills alongside the former Fresh Kills Landfill and the developing Freshkills Park.

In colonial times and in the early 19th century, the creek was used to operate up to 11 mills in the center of the island. One such mill is being restored along the creek in Historic Richmond Town.

In late 2017, a family of beavers moved into the creek, cut down over 100 trees, and contributed to local flooding. DEP destroyed a small dam, but the beavers repaired it overnight. The beaver, the state mammal, enjoys protected status, complicating efforts at population control.

<text>Stresa is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of about 4,600 residents on the shores of Lake Maggiore in the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, in the Italian region of Piedmont. about northwest of Milan. It is situated on road and rail routes to the Simplon Pass.

==History==

The name of the town first appeared in documents on 15 January AD 998 as &quot;Strixsya&quot;; later &quot;Strexia&quot;, &quot;Strexa&quot; and &quot;Stresia&quot; were used. In 1014 Stresa was donated by Emperor Henry II to the female Benedictine monastery of San Felice of Pavia. In the 15th century it grew into a fishing community and owed feudal allegiance to the House of Visconti of Milan. It subsequently came under the control of the Borromeo family. 

In 1948 American author and journalist Ernest Hemingway visited the town; he had set part of his 1929 novel &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; in the &quot;Grand Hotel des Îles Borromées&quot;.

Stresa hosted a number of political conferences in the 20th century, including in: 
*1935 when the UK, Italy and France re-affirmed the Treaty of Locarno and agreed to form the Stresa front to combat and contain Nazi Germany and
*1958 when the foundations of what would become Europe&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy of the European Economic Community were formulated

==Transport==
EuroCity train services connect south to Milan and north to Bern and Basel. Ferry-boat service from the town&#x27;s two docks provides regular access to the nearby Borromean Islands. The nearest airport is Milan Malpensa (approx. 43 km). 

Until its May 2021 deadly disaster the Stresa-Alpino-Mottarone Cable Car offered a 20-minute ride to the summit of Monte Mottarone, with the Giardino Botanico Alpinia en route. As of late 2023 this is to be rebuilt in 2024 and reenter service in summer 2025.

<text>The Hungarian Academy of Sciences ( , MTA) is the most important and prestigious learned society of Hungary. Its seat is at the bank of the Danube in Budapest, between Széchenyi rakpart and Akadémia utca. Its main responsibilities are the cultivation of science, dissemination of scientific findings, supporting research and development, and representing Hungarian science domestically and around the world.

==History==
The history of the academy began in 1825 when Count István Széchenyi offered one year&#x27;s income of his estate for the purposes of a &quot;Learned Society&quot; at a district session of the Diet in Pressburg (Pozsony, present Bratislava, seat of the Hungarian Parliament at the time), and his example was followed by other delegates. Its task was specified as the development of the Hungarian language and the study and propagation of the sciences and the arts in Hungarian. It received its current name in 1845.

Its central building was inaugurated in 1865, in Renaissance Revival architecture style. The architect was Friedrich August Stüler.

==Sections==
A scientific section is a unit of the Academy organized by one or some closely related branches of science. A scientific section follows with attention, promotes and evaluates all scientific activities conducted within its field(s) of science; takes a stand on scientific issues as well as in matters concerning science policy and research organization, submits opinion on the activities of the Academy&#x27;s research institutes, and on those of university chairs and other research units that are supported by the Academy, and participates in the procedure of awarding the title of &quot;Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences&quot;, the post-Ph.D academic degree, the D.Sc degree in Hungary.

Today it has eleven main sections:
# Linguistics and Literary Scholarship
# Philosophy and Historical Sciences
# Mathematics
# Agricultural Sciences
# Medical Sciences
# Engineering Sciences
# Chemical Sciences
# Biological Sciences
# Economics and Law
# Earth Sciences
# Physical Sciences

<text>In probability and statistics, a mixture distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable that is derived from a collection of other random variables as follows: first, a random variable is selected by chance from the collection according to given probabilities of selection, and then the value of the selected random variable is realized. The underlying random variables may be random real numbers, or they may be random vectors (each having the same dimension), in which case the mixture distribution is a multivariate distribution.

In cases where each of the underlying random variables is continuous, the outcome variable will also be continuous and its probability density function is sometimes referred to as a mixture density. The cumulative distribution function (and the probability density function if it exists) can be expressed as a convex combination (i.e. a weighted sum, with non-negative weights that sum to 1) of other distribution functions and density functions. The individual distributions that are combined to form the mixture distribution are called the mixture components, and the probabilities (or weights) associated with each component are called the mixture weights. The number of components in a mixture distribution is often restricted to being finite, although in some cases the components may be countably infinite in number. More general cases (i.e. an uncountable set of component distributions), as well as the countable case, are treated under the title of [[compound probability distribution|compound distributions]].

A distinction needs to be made between a random variable whose distribution function or density is the sum of a set of components (i.e. a mixture distribution) and a random variable whose value is the sum of the values of two or more underlying random variables, in which case the distribution is given by the convolution operator. As an example, the sum of two jointly normally distributed random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution. On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution.

Mixture distributions arise in many contexts in the literature and arise naturally where a statistical population contains two or more subpopulations. They are also sometimes used as a means of representing non-normal distributions. Data analysis concerning statistical models involving mixture distributions is discussed under the title of mixture models, while the present article concentrates on simple probabilistic and statistical properties of mixture distributions and how these relate to properties of the underlying distributions.

== Finite and countable mixtures ==
Given a finite set of probability density functions , ..., , or corresponding cumulative distribution functions ..., and weights , ..., such that and , the mixture distribution can be represented by writing either the density, , or the distribution function, , as a sum (which in both cases is a convex combination):
formula_1
formula_2
This type of mixture, being a finite sum, is called a finite mixture, and in applications, an unqualified reference to a &quot;mixture density&quot; usually means a finite mixture. The case of a countably infinite set of components is covered formally by allowing formula_3.

== Uncountable mixtures ==
Where the set of component distributions is uncountable, the result is often called a compound probability distribution. The construction of such distributions has a formal similarity to that of mixture distributions, with either infinite summations or integrals replacing the finite summations used for finite mixtures.

Consider a probability density function for a variable , parameterized by . That is, for each value of in some set , is a probability density function with respect to . Given a probability density function (meaning that is nonnegative and integrates to 1), the function

formula_4

is again a probability density function for . A similar integral can be written for the cumulative distribution function. Note that the formulae here reduce to the case of a finite or infinite mixture if the density is allowed to be a generalized function representing the &quot;derivative&quot; of the cumulative distribution function of a discrete distribution.

==Mixtures within a parametric family==
The mixture components are often not arbitrary probability distributions, but instead are members of a parametric family (such as normal distributions), with different values for a parameter or parameters. In such cases, assuming that it exists, the density can be written in the form of a sum as:
formula_5
for one parameter, or
formula_6
for two parameters, and so forth.

== Properties ==

=== Convexity ===
A general linear combination of probability density functions is not necessarily a probability density, since it may be negative or it may integrate to something other than 1. However, a convex combination of probability density functions preserves both of these properties (non-negativity and integrating to 1), and thus mixture densities are themselves probability density functions.

=== Moments ===
Let , ..., denote random variables from the component distributions, and let denote a random variable from the mixture distribution. Then, for any function for which formula_7 exists, and assuming that the component densities exist,

formula_8

The th moment about zero (i.e. choosing ) is simply a weighted average of the -th moments of the components. Moments about the mean involve a binomial expansion:

formula_9

where denotes the mean of the -th component.

In the case of a mixture of one-dimensional distributions with weights , means and variances , the total mean and variance will be:
formula_10formula_11

These relations highlight the potential of mixture distributions to display non-trivial higher-order moments such as skewness and kurtosis (fat tails) and multi-modality, even in the absence of such features within the components themselves. Marron and Wand (1992) give an illustrative account of the flexibility of this framework.

===Modes===

The question of multimodality is simple for some cases, such as mixtures of exponential distributions: all such mixtures are unimodal. However, for the case of mixtures of normal distributions, it is a complex one. Conditions for the number of modes in a multivariate normal mixture are explored by Ray &amp; Lindsay extending earlier work on univariate and multivariate distributions.

Here the problem of evaluation of the modes of an component mixture in a dimensional space is reduced to identification of critical points (local minima, maxima and saddle points) on a manifold referred to as the ridgeline surface, which is the image of the ridgeline function
formula_12
where formula_13 belongs to the formula_14-dimensional standard simplex:
formula_15
and formula_16 correspond to the covariance and mean of the -th component. Ray &amp; Lindsay consider the case in which formula_17 showing a one-to-one correspondence of modes of the mixture and those on the ridge elevation function formula_18 thus one may identify the modes by solving formula_19 with respect to formula_13 and determining the value formula_21.

Using graphical tools, the potential multi-modality of mixtures with number of components formula_22 is demonstrated; in particular it is shown that the number of modes may exceed formula_23 and that the modes may not be coincident with the component means. For two components they develop a graphical tool for analysis by instead solving the aforementioned differential with respect to the first mixing weight formula_24 (which also determines the second mixing weight through formula_25) and expressing the solutions as a function formula_26 so that the number and location of modes for a given value of formula_24 corresponds to the number of intersections of the graph on the line formula_28. This in turn can be related to the number of oscillations of the graph and therefore to solutions of formula_29 leading to an explicit solution for the case of a two component mixture with formula_30 (sometimes called a homoscedastic mixture) given by
formula_31
where formula_32 
is the Mahalanobis distance between formula_33 and formula_34.

Since the above is quadratic it follows that in this instance there are at most two modes irrespective of the dimension or the weights.

For normal mixtures with general formula_35 and formula_36, a lower bound for the maximum number of possible modes, andconditionally on the assumption that the maximum number is finitean upper bound are known. For those combinations of formula_23 and formula_38 for which the maximum number is known, it matches the lower bound.

==Examples==

===Two normal distributions===
Simple examples can be given by a mixture of two normal distributions. (See Multimodal distribution#Mixture of two normal distributions for more details.)

Given an equal (50/50) mixture of two normal distributions with the same standard deviation and different means (homoscedastic), the overall distribution will exhibit low kurtosis relative to a single normal distribution – the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, namely by twice the (common) standard deviation, so formula_39 these form a bimodal distribution, otherwise it simply has a wide peak. The variation of the overall population will also be greater than the variation of the two subpopulations (due to spread from different means), and thus exhibits overdispersion relative to a normal distribution with fixed variation , though it will not be overdispersed relative to a normal distribution with variation equal to variation of the overall population.

Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution.

===A normal and a Cauchy distribution===
The following example is adapted from Hampel, who credits John Tukey.

Consider the mixture distribution defined by 

The mean of i.i.d. observations from behaves &quot;normally&quot; except for exorbitantly large samples, although the mean of does not even exist.

== Applications ==
Mixture densities are complicated densities expressible in terms of simpler densities (the mixture components), and are used both because they provide a good model for certain data sets (where different subsets of the data exhibit different characteristics and can best be modeled separately), and because they can be more mathematically tractable, because the individual mixture components can be more easily studied than the overall mixture density.

Mixture densities can be used to model a statistical population with subpopulations, where the mixture components are the densities on the subpopulations, and the weights are the proportions of each subpopulation in the overall population.

Mixture densities can also be used to model experimental error or contamination – one assumes that most of the samples measure the desired phenomenon, with some samples from a different, erroneous distribution.

Parametric statistics that assume no error often fail on such mixture densities – for example, statistics that assume normality often fail disastrously in the presence of even a few outliers – and instead one uses robust statistics.

In meta-analysis of separate studies, study heterogeneity causes distribution of results to be a mixture distribution, and leads to overdispersion of results relative to predicted error. For example, in a statistical survey, the margin of error (determined by sample size) predicts the sampling error and hence dispersion of results on repeated surveys. The presence of study heterogeneity (studies have different sampling bias) increases the dispersion relative to the margin of error.

<text>Mary J. Ruwart (born October 16, 1949) is an American retired biomedical researcher and a libertarian speaker, writer, and activist. She was a leading candidate for the 2008 Libertarian Party presidential nomination and is the author of the book &quot;Healing Our World&quot;.

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Ruwart was born in Detroit, Michigan. She holds a Bachelor of Science with a major in biochemistry (1970), and a doctorate in biophysics (1974) from Michigan State University. After a 2½ year term on the faculty of the Department of Surgery at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Ruwart spent 19 years as a pharmaceutical research scientist for Upjohn Pharmaceuticals, and has written extensively on the subjects of government regulation of the drug industry and on libertarian communication.

==Libertarian activism and candidacies==
A member of the Libertarian Party, Ruwart campaigned unsuccessfully for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1984 and for the vice-presidential nomination in 1992. Ruwart was the Libertarian Party of Texas&#x27;s nominee for U.S. Senate in 2000, where she faced incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison; Ruwart polled 1.16% of the popular vote (72,798 votes), finishing fourth of four candidates behind Green Party candidate Douglas Sandage.

Ruwart has served on the Libertarian National Committee, and was a keynote speaker at the 2004 Libertarian National Convention. In 2002, libertarians launched an unsuccessful lobbying campaign to get Dr. Ruwart appointed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner. Additionally, Ruwart has served on the boards of the International Society for Individual Liberty, the Fully Informed Jury Association, and the Michigan chapter of the Heartland Institute. Ruwart is a longtime supporter of the Free State Project and officially endorsed it on May 17, 2008 while on-air on Free Talk Live.

Ruwart unsuccessfully ran for Texas Comptroller in 2010 against incumbent Republican Susan Combs. She received 417,523 votes (10.5%) in a race that had no Democrat.

===2008 presidential campaign===

In March 2008, in response to an informal draft effort by a group of Libertarian Party activists, Ruwart announced her candidacy for the Libertarian presidential nomination in the 2008 election. She ran on a platform of ending military intervention overseas and nation-building, ending torture, ending foreign aid, promoting free trade, eliminating welfare entitlements and creating jobs by slashing government spending.

She lost the nomination to Bob Barr on the sixth ballot at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention on May 25, 2008. Despite tying with Barr on the third and fourth ballots and taking the lead on the fifth, she ultimately lost after third-placed candidate Wayne Allyn Root threw his support behind Barr. Root later received the vice-presidential nomination.

==Child pornography comment==
Leading to the 2008 Libertarian Party nomination, Ruwart replied to the question of &quot;How can a libertarian argue against child pornography?&quot;:
&quot;Children who willingly participate in sexual acts have the right to make that decision as well, even if it’s distasteful to us personally. Some children will make poor choices just as some adults do in smoking and drinking to excess. When we outlaw child pornography, the prices paid for child performers rise, increasing the incentives for parents to use children against their will.&quot;

<doc id="708249" wikidata="Q7786843" url="?curid=708249" title="Thomas A. Bailey">
<text>Thomas Andrew Bailey (December 14, 1902 – July 26, 1983) was a professor of history at his alma mater, Stanford University, and wrote many historical monographs on diplomatic history, as well as the widely used American history textbook, &quot;The American Pageant&quot;. He was known for his witty style and clever terms he coined, such as &quot;international gangsterism.&quot; He popularized diplomatic history with his entertaining textbooks and lectures, the presentation style of which followed Ephraim Douglass Adams. Bailey contended foreign policy was significantly affected by public opinion, and that current policymakers could learn from history.

==Early life and education==
Bailey received his B.A. in 1924, M.A. in 1925, and Ph.D in 1927, all from Stanford University, where he was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. His doctoral work was in U.S. political history. He switched his emphasis towards diplomatic history while teaching at the University of Hawaii.

==Career==
After three years at Hawaii, he taught American history for nearly 40 years at Stanford and also served as a visiting professor at Harvard University, Cornell University, the University of Washington, and the National War College in Washington, D.C. He retired in 1968.

Bailey authored a number of articles in the 1930s that indicated the historical techniques he would use throughout his career. While not groundbreaking, they remain noteworthy for the care with which Bailey systematically overturned received myths about U.S. diplomatic history by a careful reexamination of the underlying sources. His first book was a study of the diplomatic crisis over racial issues between the United States and Japan during the Theodore Roosevelt administration. 

He delivered the Albert Shaw Lectures on Diplomatic History at Johns Hopkins University on the Wilson administration&#x27;s policy towards neutral nations in 1917-1918, later published in 1942. While the impact of public opinion on the making of foreign policy was a theme that ran through most of his works, he laid it out most clearly in &quot;The Man in the Street&quot;, published in 1948.

Perhaps the harshest attack on Wilson&#x27;s diplomacy came from Bailey in two books that remain widely cited by scholars, &quot;Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace&quot; (1944) and &quot;Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal&quot; (1945), Bailey:
:contended that Wilson&#x27;s wartime isolationism, as well as his peace proposals at war&#x27;s end, were seriously flawed. Highlighting the fact that American delegates encountered staunch opposition to Wilson&#x27;s proposed League of Nations, Bailey concluded that the president and his diplomatic staff essentially sold out, compromising important American ideals to secure mere fragments of Wilson&#x27;s progressive vision. Hence, while Bailey primarily targeted President Wilson in these critiques, others ... did not emerge unscathed.

He trained more than 20 doctoral students in his career.

He was married to Sylvia Dean, daughter of a former University of Hawaii president.

===Honors and awards===
In 1960 he served as president of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association. In 1968, he was elected to the presidencies of both the Organization of American Historians and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. The Commonwealth Club of California awarded him gold medals in 1940 for his &quot;Diplomatic History of the American People&quot; and 1944 for his &quot;Woodrow Wilson and the Lost Peace&quot;.

<text>Tazewell County () is a county located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,429. Its county seat is Tazewell.

Tazewell County is part of the Bluefield, WV-VA Micropolitan Statistical Area. Its economy was dependent on coal and iron of the Pocahontas Fields from the late 19th into the 20th century.

== History ==

Tazewell County was long a hunting ground for various historic Native American tribes and their ancestral indigenous cultures. Although rare in the eastern United States, there are petroglyphs near the summit of Paintlick Mountain. Among the tribes that occupied this area in historic times were the Lenape (Delaware), and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee and members of the Iroquois Confederacy.

In the spring of 1771, Thomas and John Witten established the first permanent settlement in Tazewell County at Crab Orchard.

As population increased in the area, Tazewell County was created on December 20, 1799. The land for the county was taken from portions of Wythe and Russell counties. It was named after Henry Tazewell, a United States senator from Virginia, state legislator and judge. Delegate Littleton Waller Tazewell originally opposed the formation of the new county but when Simon Cotterel, who drew up the bill to form the county, changed the originally proposed name of the county to Tazewell&#x27;s namesake, in honor of his father Henry who had died earlier that year, the bill passed.

Jeffersonville was established the following year (1800) as the county seat. On February 29, 1892, Jeffersonville was renamed as Tazewell.

During the early settlement period, many Scots-Irish settled through the Appalachian backcountry, including Tazewell.

After the Civil War, construction of railroads in southwestern Virginia enabled the development of coal and iron resources in the Clinch Valley. Richlands had a boom economy in the early 1890s, and became a rougher place with young industrial workers and more saloons.

The profits generated by the coal boom resulted in the development of mansions and the elaborate Richlands Hotel, said to rival the best hotels of New York City. But it was forced to close after the boom cycle ended. It was used for other purposes.

Tazewell County was the focus of a 2005 article in Time Magazine about the opioid epidemic: however, the sheriff H. S. Caudill claimed the article misrepresented Tazewell County and his statements to the reporter.

==Representation in other media==
Paramount&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Lassie&quot; was filmed here. It was based on stories of Albert Payson Terhune.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

Since it contains portions of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and the Cumberland Plateau, Tazewell County has very distinct geologic areas within the county. One of the most unusual areas is Burke&#x27;s Garden, a bowl-shaped valley formed by the erosion of a doubly plunging anticline. Tazewell County includes the headwaters of four watersheds, which are the Upper Clinch, Middle New, North Fork Holston, and Tug. It also has the headwaters of the Bluestone River, which flows into West Virginia, where a portion is protected as a Wild and Scenic River.

<doc id="708253" wikidata="Q340591" url="?curid=708253" title="Sussex County, Virginia">
<text>Sussex County is a rural county located in the southeast of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,829. Its county seat is Sussex. It was formed in 1754 from Surry County. The county is named after the county of Sussex, England.

Sussex County is included in the Greater Richmond Region.

==History==
Native Americans may have settled near Cactus Hill along the Nottoway River as long as 10,000 years ago. This area later was organized by English colonists as Sussex County. The historic Nottoway people, although they spoke an Iroquoian language, were loosely part of the Powhatan Confederacy. It was composed mainly of Algonquian-speaking peoples from the coastal zone. 

When colonists arrived from England in 1607, some traveled along the Nottoway River. But when they established the first counties in the colony, James City County included both sides of the James River to the North Carolina line. The south side of the James River later was organized as Surry County in 1652. Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly formed Sussex County in 1754 from the southwestern end of Surry County.

Sussex County has maintained a predominantly agricultural economy, once based in tobacco and cotton commodity crops, with work primarily done by enslaved African Americans. It has preserved some of its historic heritage for centuries. Important sites include the Nottoway Archeological Site, Sussex County Courthouse Historic District and the Waverly Downtown Historic District, and six historic homes, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The largest forest fire in Virginia&#x27;s recorded history occurred on April 5, 1943, destroying more than 12,000 acres in six hours. Fire were usually fought by recruiting workmen from Gray Lumber Company, but the mill was closed and most were attending the funeral of Ella Darden Gray, matriarch of one of the county&#x27;s leading families. Her son Senator Garland Gray helped bring attention to the state&#x27;s need for more protection for valuable forests. 

About a decade later, Senator Gray became a leader in the Massive Resistance of whites against desegregating Virginia&#x27;s public schools.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

<text>Surry County is a county in the southeastern part of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,561.

In 1652, Surry County was formed from the portion of James City County south of the James River. For more than 350 years it has depended on an agricultural economy. The county has 19 sites listed on the National Register, including a landmark occupied in 1676 known as Bacon&#x27;s Castle and Chippokes Plantation (now a state park). The Jamestown Ferry provides easy access to Virginia&#x27;s Historic Triangle, featuring Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, linked by the National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway.

The county is known for farming, curing Virginia Hams, and harvesting lumber, notably Virginia pine.

== History==
During the times of the Virginia Colony, Surry County was formed in 1652 from a portion of James City County (one of the original 8 counties formed in 1634) south of the James River. It was named for the English county of Surrey. Surry County initially consisted of two parishes of the Church of England: Lawne&#x27;s Creek and Southwark.

Nearby, in 1665, Arthur Allen built a Jacobean brick house. A decade later it became known as Bacon&#x27;s Castle because it was occupied as a fort or &quot;castle&quot; during Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion against the Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley. (Nathaniel Bacon never lived at Bacon&#x27;s Castle, but rather at Curles Neck Plantation in Henrico County, about 30 miles upriver on the James River&#x27;s northern bank).

The first town, Cobham, was established in 1691 at the mouth of Gray&#x27;s Creek, where it flows into the James River. Neighboring Sussex County was formed from the southwestern end of Surry County in 1754. After the American Revolutionary War, during which the British Legion looted the county, Surry County became part of the new Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the first 13 United States.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate Army included the Surry Light Artillery and the Surry Cavalry.

In 1873, a New Jersey timberman, David Steele, with financing from Baltimore interests, began a lumber business in Surry County but went bankrupt a decade later. Baltimore investors Waters and Company incorporated the Surry Lumber Company in 1885. In 1886 it incorporated the Surry, Sussex, and Southampton Railway, which delivered lumber to Scotland wharf on the James River (now the Jamestown Ferry terminal). The company (headquartered at Sedley, Virginia) and SS&amp;S railroad grew, reaching their heyday around 1920. But the company did not replant after it cut the old-growth pine, and found further logging in the area difficult after 1925.

In 1927, it closed its mills in Dendron, Virginia, causing considerable economic distress in the county. The railway went bankrupt in 1930. Gray Lumber Company of Waverly, Virginia, which replanted its timber cuts, bought 15,000 acres from the Surry Lumber Company in 1941, and other companies soon bought the rest of the company&#x27;s acreage.

The Temperance, Industrial and Collegiate Institute, a school for black Americans, was located in Surry County from 1892 to 1928. A Virginia State Historic Marker is located at the site of the former campus in Claremont, and a memorial to the school&#x27;s founder, John Jefferson Smallwood, is located at the Abundant Life Church Cemetery in Spring Grove.

As part of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Massive Resistance&quot; to integration following &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, Surry County closed its white public schools so no black students could attend. Foundation&#x27;s School, a private, whites-only school was established. Grants and other provisions were made to provide public support for private education for the white students affected.

The two-unit Surry Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned in 1972 and 1973 and is expected to remain active until 2053.

== Notable incidents in Surry County ==
=== Dog fighting investigation ===

Beginning on April 25, 2007, Surry County Sheriff Harold D. Brown and part-time county Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney (prosecutor) Gerald G. Poindexter led a high-profile dog fighting investigation. Authorities investigating Davon T. Boddie, 26, on a narcotics issue found evidence of dogfighting activities at home and property in Surry County where he lived. It was owned by his cousin, then Atlanta Falcons NFL-football player Michael Vick. Officials confiscated 66 dogs, 55 of which were pit bulls, and other evidence. An ESPN source alleged that Vick was a &quot;heavyweight&quot; in dogfighting and had been known to wager $40,000 on the outcome of a single fight.

By August 20, 2007, all the defendants charged in Federal court, including Vick, had agreed to guilty pleas under plea bargain agreements. They were sentenced to terms ranging from 6 to 23 months, to be served in federal prisons. The abused dogs were placed in foster or adoptive homes.

On February 26, 2009, Vick was approved for release to home confinement. He was released on May 21, 2009, to be confined for the remainder of his 23-month term of imprisonment under home confinement.

<text>Suffolk ( ) is an independent city in Virginia, United States. As of 2020, the population was 94,324. It is the 10th-most populous city in Virginia, the largest city in Virginia by boundary land area as well as the 14th-largest in the country.
Suffolk is located in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. This also includes the independent cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Virginia Beach, and smaller cities, counties, and towns of Hampton Roads. With miles of waterfront property on the Nansemond and James rivers, present-day Suffolk was formed in 1974 after consolidating with Nansemond County and the towns of Holland and Whaleyville. The current mayor (as of 2021) is Mike Duman.

==History==

Prior to colonization, the region was inhabited by the indigenous Nansemond people. The settlement of Suffolk was established in 1742 by Virginian colonists as a port town on the Nansemond River. It was originally named Constant&#x27;s Warehouse (for John Constant, one of the first founders of the settlement) before being renamed after Royal Governor of Virginia Sir William Gooch&#x27;s home county of the same name in England. During the colonial era, Virginian colonists in the region cultivated tobacco with enslaved labor as a cash crop, before transitioning to mixed farming. Suffolk was designated as the county seat of Nansemond County in 1750.

Early in its history, Suffolk became a land transportation gateway to the areas east of it in South Hampton Roads. Before the American Civil War, both the Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad and the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad were built through Suffolk, early predecessors of 21st-century Class 1 railroads operated by CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, respectively. Other railroads and later major highways followed after the war.

Suffolk became an incorporated town in 1808. Suffolk became a stop on the Atlantic and Danville Railway in 1890. In 1910, it incorporated as a city and separated from Nansemond County. However, it remained the seat of Nansemond County until 1972, when its former county became the independent city of Nansemond. In 1974, the independent cities of Suffolk and Nansemond merged under Suffolk&#x27;s name and charter.

Peanuts grown in the surrounding areas became a major agricultural industry for Suffolk. Notably, Planters&#x27; Peanuts was established in Suffolk beginning in 1912. Suffolk was the &#x27;birthplace&#x27; of Mr. Peanut, the mascot of Planters&#x27; Peanuts. For many years, the call-letters of local AM radio station WLPM stood for World&#x27;s Largest Peanut Market. (WLPM&#x27;s license was cancelled in 1996 )

==Geography==
Suffolk is located at (36.741347, −76.609881).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (6.7%) is water. It is the largest city in Virginia by land area and second largest by total area. Part of the Great Dismal Swamp is located in Suffolk.

===2008 tornado===
The city was hit by an EF3 tornado which produced a large swath of extensive damage through the city and nearby communities during the late afternoon of April 28, 2008. After 4:00 PM EDT on April 28, a tornado touched down multiple times, causing damage and leaving more than 200 injured in Suffolk. the path of the storm passed north and west of the downtown area, striking near Sentara Obici Hospital and in the neighborhood of Driver. The storm seriously damaged more than 120 homes and 12 businesses. The subdivisions of Burnett&#x27;s Mill and Hillpoint Farms were severely damaged, as were several older historic structures in Driver. Near Driver, the large radio and television broadcast towers, which were located in an antenna farm serving most of Hampton Roads, were spared serious damage.

Governor Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency and directed state agencies to assist the recovery and cleanup efforts. Police officers and firefighters from across Hampton Roads were sent to Suffolk to help in a quarantine and cleanup of the damaged areas. On May 1, the state estimated property damages at $20 million.

==Education==

Suffolk Public Schools, the local public school system, operates 12 elementary schools, four middle schools, three high schools, and one alternative school. Nansemond-Suffolk Academy is a private college preparatory school located on Pruden Blvd.

Paul D. Camp Community College has a campus in Suffolk.

==Transportation==

Suffolk&#x27;s early growth depended on its waterfront location, with access to the waterways for power and transportation. Subsequent transportation infrastructure upgraded its connections with other markets. These continue to be major factors in the 21st century.

===Bike trails===
The Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge includes dozens of miles of trails accessible via White Marsh Road at Washington Ditch and other entry sites. Additional bike trails can be found at Lone Star Lakes City Park off Godwin Blvd. This city park provides over of rock trails. There are many rural roads with light traffic available for road riding. Adjacent to Suffolk is Isle of Wight County, where a county facility called Nike Park includes a bike trail approximately 2 miles in a loop.

===Waterways===
Suffolk was initially a port at the head of navigation of the Nansemond River. The Nansemond flows into the James River near its mouth and the ice-free harbor of Hampton Roads.

===Railroads===
The two railroads completed through Suffolk before the American Civil War were later joined by four more. These were eventually consolidated during the modern merger era of North American railroads which began around 1960. Suffolk was served by several passenger lines, concluding with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Mountaineer&quot;, which ended in 1977. At least two former passenger stations are still standing, the Seaboard Coast Line station, now the Seaboard Station Railroad Museum, and the Norfolk and Western Railway station at 100 Hollady Street. The N&amp;W station was used by Amtrak (as &quot;Holiday Street&quot;) until 1977 when the &quot;Mountaineer&quot; was replaced by a bus connection to the &quot;Hilltopper.&quot; Currently, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; between Norfolk and Petersburg passes by the N&amp;W station without stopping.

Today, Suffolk is served by three freight railroads. It is located on a potential branch line for the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor between Petersburg, Virginia and South Hampton Roads, being studied by the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation.

===Highways===
Suffolk is served by U.S. Highways 17, 13, 58, 258, and 460. Interstate 664, part of the Hampton Roads Beltway, crosses through the northeastern edge of the city. State Route 10 is also a major highway in the area.

In 2006, Suffolk assumed control of its road system from the Virginia Department of Transportation, which is customary among Virginia&#x27;s independent cities. Since the Byrd Road Act of 1932 created Virginia&#x27;s Secondary Roads System, the state maintains the roads in most counties and towns. An exception was made by the General Assembly when the former Nansemond County became an independent city and consolidated Suffolk in the 1970s. The state maintained the primary and secondary routes in Suffolk until July 1, 2006.

===Bridges, bridge-tunnel===
The Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel connects Suffolk to the independent city of Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula from South Hampton Roads. It is part of the Hampton Roads Beltway, a circumferential interstate highway that links the seven largest cities of Hampton Roads. Completed in 1992, it provided a third major vehicle crossing of the Hampton Roads harbor area and cost $400 million to build.

The city and VDOT have had disputes over ownership and responsibility for the Kings Highway Bridge (circa 1928) across the Nansemond River on State Route 125. VDOT closed it in 2005 for safety reasons.

About 3,300 motorists a day used the bridge that connected Chuckatuck and Driver. The closure forced detours of as much as . The cost of a new bridge for the King&#x27;s Highway crossing is estimated at $48 million, far more than could be recovered through collection of tolls at that location. In 2007, VDOT announced that it would contract for demolition and removal of the bridge. According to newspaper accounts, this was the first time in VDOT&#x27;s history that it did not plan for a replacement facility.

Virginia is reviewing proposals under a public-private partnership for a major realignment and upgrade of U.S. 460 from Suffolk west to Interstate 295 near Petersburg. In 1995, the Virginia General Assembly passed the Public-Private Transportation Act, allowing private entities to propose innovative solutions for designing, constructing, financing, and operating transportation improvements. The new roadway would be funded through collection of tolls.

As part of the Suffolk 2026 Comprehensive Plan, the city plans to bypass the crossroads community of Whaleyville in southwestern Suffolk City. US 13 (along with NC Highway 11) is a strategic highway corridor in North Carolina toward Greenville.

===Public transportation===
The City of Suffolk operates Suffolk Transit, which provides local bus service. Two connections to Hampton Roads Transit buses are also available.

==Economy==
In modern times, Suffolk remains a major peanut processing center and railroad and highway transportation hub. It hosts a diverse combination of industrial, manufacturing, distribution, retail, and hospitality businesses, as well as active farming.

In 2002, the new Louise Obici Memorial Hospital was completed and dedicated. It was acquired in 2005 by the Sentara Health System. Planters&#x27; Peanuts has been a major employer, now owned by Kraft Foods. Each fall since 1977, the City of Suffolk hosts Suffolk Festivals Incorporated&#x27;s annual Peanut Fest.

Other large employers in the City of Suffolk include Unilever, Lipton Tea, Massimo Zanetti Beverage Group, Wal-Mart, Target, QVC, and two major modeling and simulation companies, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. Lockheed Martin built its &quot;Center for Innovation&quot; around a lighthouse in Suffolk, for which the campus is called &#x27;The Lighthouse&#x27;. Raytheon won a DoD contract to manufacture &#x27;Miniature Air-Launched Decoy Jammers&#x27;(MALD-J), which it has been producing with Cobham Composite Products: 202 vehicles for a price of $81 million.

The U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) facility, near the intersection of US 17 and Interstate 664, has resulted in a growth in defense contracting and high-tech jobs since 1999. Through the following decade, JFCOM employed a growing number of defense contractors until it reached over 3,000. By September 2010, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended to decommission JFCOM, as a matter of reallocating and rebalancing the U.S. Department of Defense budget, to better address changing needs and fiscal demands.

The announcement led to speculation about the effects the loss of JFCOM would have on the Hampton Roads economy in general and (more specifically), on the future of related businesses located in the Harborview section of Suffolk. In August 2011 JFCOM was disestablished. But many critical JFCOM functions, such as joint training, joint exercises, and joint development were retained in the buildings vacated by JFCOM, under the auspices of the Joint Staff J7 Directorate, referred to as either &quot;Pentagon South&quot; or &quot;Joint and Coalition Warfighting&quot;.

By summer 2013, city officials expected the Naval Network Warfare Command, NNWC Global Network Operations Center Detachment, Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command and Navy Cyber Forces to occupy buildings vacated by JFCOM. These commands have been considered a boon to north Suffolk, bringing an estimated 1,000 additional employees, counting military, civilians and contractors, with an estimated annual payroll of $88.9 million. The buildup in these defense functions resulted in Suffolk&#x27;s median income increasing markedly in this period.

==Media==
Suffolk&#x27;s daily newspapers are the local &quot;Suffolk News-Herald&quot;, the &quot;Virginian-Pilot&quot; from Norfolk and the &quot;Daily Press&quot; of Newport News. Other papers include the &quot;New Journal and Guide&quot;, and &quot;Inside Business&quot;. &quot;Coastal Virginia Magazine&quot; serves as a bi-monthly regional magazine for Suffolk and the Hampton Roads area. &quot;Hampton Roads Times&quot; serves as an online magazine for all the Hampton Roads cities and counties. Suffolk is served by a variety of radio stations on the AM and FM dials, with towers located around the Hampton Roads area.

Suffolk is also served by several television stations. The Hampton Roads designated market area (DMA) is the 42nd largest in the U.S. with 712,790 homes (0.64% of the total U.S.). The major network television affiliates are WTKR-TV 3 (CBS), WAVY 10 (NBC), WVEC-TV 13 (ABC), WGNT 27 (CW), WTVZ 33 (MyNetworkTV), WVBT 43 (FOX), and WPXV 49 (ION Television). The Public Broadcasting Service station is WHRO-TV 15. Suffolk residents also can receive independent stations, such as WSKY broadcasting on channel 4 from the Outer Banks of North Carolina and WGBS-LD broadcasting on channel 11 from Hampton. Suffolk is served by Charter Communications. The City of Suffolk Media &amp; Community Relations Department operates Municipal Channel 8 on the local Charter Cable television system. Programming includes television coverage of many City activities and events, including live Government-access television (GATV) broadcasts of all regular City Council meetings, and special features including &quot;On The Scene&quot;, &quot;Suffolk Seniorcize&quot;, and &quot;Suffolk Business Today&quot;. DirecTV and Dish Network are also popular as an alternative to cable television in Suffolk.

==Boroughs==
Suffolk is divided politically into seven boroughs, one corresponding to the former city of Suffolk and one corresponding to each of the six magisterial districts of the former Nansemond County. The boroughs are Chuckatuck, Cypress, Holy Neck, Nansemond, Sleepy Hole, Suffolk, and Whaleyville.

==Sister cities==
In 1981, the county of Suffolk in England became Suffolk&#x27;s first sister city as a result of the personal interest in the Sister Cities concept by Virginia&#x27;s Governor, Mills E. Godwin. A native of the city, Governor Godwin believed that Sister Cities would benefit the community culturally and educationally. Suffolk&#x27;s second sister city relationship with Oderzo, Italy, began in 1995 because of one man, Amedeo Obici. Mr. Obici was a native of Oderzo and the founder of Planters Nut and Chocolate Company in Suffolk.

Suffolk Sister Cities International, Inc. (SSCI) is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit established to promote international relationships as directed by Suffolk City Council through its appointed Suffolk Sister Cities Commission. Its membership is open to all who are interested in fostering the goals of the organization.

<doc id="708258" wikidata="Q1076085" url="?curid=708258" title="Exceptionalism">
<text>Exceptionalism is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is &quot;&quot; (i.e., unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication, whether or not specified, that the referent is superior in some way.

Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today it is particularly applied with respect to particular nations or regions.

Other uses of the term include medical and genetic exceptionalism.

==History==

The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the &quot;Volk&quot;, comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions. Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a &quot;national spirit&quot;, or &quot;soul of the people&quot; (in German: &quot;Volksgeist&quot;). This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands—especially in ones ruled by élites from somewhere else.

Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the United States, Australia (especially in South Australia), China, France, Germany, Greece, Pakistan, Imperial Japan, Iran, Serbia, Israel, North Korea, South Africa, Spain, the UK, the USSR, Thailand and Lebanon. Historians have added many other cases, including historic empires such as China, the Ottoman Empire, ancient Rome, and ancient India, along with a wide range of minor kingdoms in history.

== Criticism ==

Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to historicism in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons. A group may assert &quot;exceptionalism&quot; in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. This can be an example of special pleading, a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons. Exceptionalism is often based on poor historical knowledge.

== Separateness ==
J. Bradford DeLong has used the term &quot;exceptionalism&quot; to describe the economic growth of post-World War II Western Europe.

Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to historicism in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. Political scientist Noritada Matsuda writes, &quot;[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries.&quot;

In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert &quot;exceptionalism&quot;, with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of special pleading, a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison.

The term &quot;exceptionalism&quot; can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the United States government to join various international treaties is sometimes called &quot;exceptionalist&quot;.

==Medical exceptionalism==
Use of the term &quot;HIV exceptionalism&quot; implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases.

<doc id="708259" wikidata="Q502250" url="?curid=708259" title="Staunton, Virginia">
<text>Staunton ( ) is an independent city in the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,750. In Virginia, independent cities are separate jurisdictions from the counties that surround them, so the government offices of Augusta County are in Verona, which is contiguous to Staunton. Staunton is a principal city of the Staunton-Waynesboro Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a 2010 population of 118,502. Staunton is known for being the birthplace of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. president, and as the home of Mary Baldwin University, historically a women&#x27;s college. The city is also home to Stuart Hall, a private co-ed preparatory school, as well as the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind. It was the first city in the United States with a fully defined city manager system.

==History==

The area was first settled in 1732 by John Lewis and family. In 1736, William Beverley, a wealthy planter and merchant from Essex County, was granted by the Crown over in what would become Augusta County. Surveyor Thomas Lewis in 1746 laid out the first town plat for Beverley of what was originally called Beverley&#x27;s Mill Place. Founded in 1747, it was renamed in honor of Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife to Royal Lieutenant-Governor Sir William Gooch. Because the town was located at the geographical center of the colony (which then included West Virginia), Staunton served between 1738 and 1771 as regional capital for much of what was later known as the Northwest Territory, with the westernmost courthouse in British North America prior to the Revolution. By 1760, Staunton was one of the major &quot;remote trading centers in the backcountry&quot; which coordinated the transportation of the vast amounts of grain and tobacco then being produced in response to the change of Britain from a net exporter of produce to an importer. Staunton thus played a crucial role in the mid 18th century expansion of the economies of the American Colonies which, in turn, contributed to the success of the American Revolution. It served as capital of Virginia in June 1781, when state legislators fled Richmond and then Charlottesville to avoid capture by the British.

Like most of colonial Virginia, slavery was present in Staunton. For instance, in 1815, a slave named Henry ran away from John G. Wright&#x27;s Staunton plantation. Wright placed an ad in the &quot;Daily National Intelligencer&quot; in Washington, D.C. seeking Henry&#x27;s return. It notes that Henry was an excellent cook and was widely travelled, having been as far as the West Indies.

===The Civil War and immediately prior===

In August 1855, President Franklin Pierce visited Staunton. He gave a speech at the Virginia Hotel, in which he stated that his &quot;feelings revolted from the idea of a dissolution of the union.&quot; He said that &quot;[i]t would be the Iliad of innumerable woes, from the contemplation of which he shrank.&quot;

Located along the Valley Pike, Staunton developed as a trade, transportation and industrial center, particularly after the Virginia Central Railroad arrived in 1854. Factories made carriages, wagons, boots and shoes, clothing and blankets. In 1860, the Staunton Military Academy was founded. By 1860, Staunton had at least one pro-Union, pro-slavery (the &quot;Staunton Spectator&quot;) and at least one pro-secession, pro-slavery newspaper (the &quot;Staunton Vindicator&quot;). The &quot;Spectator&quot; ran editorials before the war urging its citizens to vote for union, while the &quot;Vindicator&quot; ran, e.g., stories reporting on &quot;unruly&quot; slaves mutilating themselves to escape being sold.

On May 23, 1861, shortly after the firing on Fort Sumter began the American Civil War, Virginians voted on whether to ratify articles of secession from the Union and join the Confederate States. The articles were overwhelmingly approved throughout the Commonwealth, even in the majority of the counties that would later become West Virginia. The vote in Staunton was 3,300 in favor of secession, with only 6 opposed. During the war, the town became an important Shenandoah Valley manufacturing center, a staging area, and a supply depot for the Confederacy.

On June 6, 1864, Union Major General David Hunter arrived with 10,000 troops to cut supply, communication and railway lines useful to the Confederacy. The next day, they destroyed the railroad station, warehouses, houses, factories and mills. Union soldiers looted the stores and warehouses and confiscated supplies.

===Postbellum Staunton===
On July 10, 1902, Staunton became an independent city.
In 1908, Staunton adopted the city manager form of government. Charles E. Ashburner was hired by Staunton as the nation&#x27;s first city manager.

On January 26, 1926, Staunton adopted Lady Rebecca Staunton&#x27;s coat of arms for use as the city&#x27;s official coat of arms and its flag.

===Western State Hospital===

Staunton is also home to the former Western State Asylum, a hospital for the mentally ill, which originally began operations in 1828. The hospital was renamed Western State Hospital in 1894.

In its early days, the facility was a resort-style asylum. It had terraced gardens where patients could plant flowers and take walks, roof walks to provide mountain views, and many architectural details to create an atmosphere that would aid in the healing process. However, by the mid 19th Century, this utopian model of care had vanished, replaced by overcrowding in the facility and the warehousing of patients. Techniques such as &quot;ankle and wrist restraints, physical coercion, and straitjackets&quot; were used. After the passage of the Eugenical Sterilization Act of 1924 in Virginia, patients were forcibly sterilized at Western State until the law authorizing the practice was repealed in the 1970s. Later, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were practiced at the facility.

When Western State vacated the property and moved its adult patients to its present site near Interstate 81, the facility was renamed the Staunton Correctional Center and turned into a medium-security men&#x27;s penitentiary. The prison closed in 2003, and the site was left vacant for several years. In 2005, the state of Virginia gave the original property to the Staunton Industrial Authority. It is now a condominium complex called The Villages at Staunton.

A separate complex, The DeJarnette State Sanatoruim, was constructed in 1932 and acted as a location for patients with the ability to pay for their treatment. Dr. DeJarnette was the superintendent of the sanatorium from its opening until his retirement in 1947.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , virtually all of which is land. Staunton is located in the Shenandoah Valley in between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains of the Appalachian Mountains. It is drained by Lewis Creek. Lewis Creek flows into the Shenandoah River, which flows into the Potomac, and eventually to the Chesapeake Bay.

In 2012, it also became the home of the Heifetz International Music Institute, named for renowned violinist Daniel Heifetz, a summer music school and festival dedicated to the artistic growth and career development of some of the World&#x27;s most talented and promising classical musicians. The Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is open for visitors, as well as the Museum of American Frontier Culture, which provides insight into life in early America.

The Staunton Music Festival – which celebrated its 20th year in 2017 – features multiple concerts each day, with programs of music from the Renaissance to the present. The festival takes place during the early part of August annually. All performances take place at historic venues in downtown Staunton.

The Queen City Mischief and Magic festival - which celebrated its 4th year in 2019 - is a new but quickly-growing festival for Harry Potter fans, attracting over 10,000 people in its 3rd year. Visitors from all over the east coast come to take part in games, events, and shopping throughout downtown. Businesses contribute the activities for the festival and the majority of West Beverley St is shut down for the weekend event.

Staunton is also the center of numerous galleries and art schools, the widely regarded Beverley Street Studio School and its associated Co-Art Gallery. In addition, Staunton is home to the Hypnagogia Film Collective, a collection of avant-garde experimental filmmakers.

Staunton is home to the Statler Brothers, country music legends who until 1994 performed free concerts at the annual Fourth of July celebration, accompanied by other country music artists. Statler Brothers members Don Reid, Harold Reid, and Phil Balsley grew up in the city. Lew DeWitt was also a notable member of the Statlers who grew up in Staunton.

===Film===
Downtown Staunton and Sherwood Avenue were used in the American Civil War film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. The local Shenandoah Valley Railroad as well as a number of nearby houses were used in filming of &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;. In 1993, a portion of the Showtime production of &quot;Assault at West Point: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker&quot; was filmed here. In the summer of 2006, some scenes for the movie &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; were also filmed in Staunton. Some scenes for &quot;Familiar Strangers&quot; were also filmed in Staunton in 2007. In 2013, scenes from the documentary film &quot;Rita Dove: An American Poet&quot; were filmed in and around Staunton&#x27;s Temple House of Israel synagogue.

=== Attractions ===
Staunton is home to nearly 200 buildings designed by architect Thomas Jasper Collins (1844–1925), who worked in various styles during the Victorian era. His firm, T. J. Collins &amp; Sons, is still in business.

The city was once home to about ten hotels, but only one of them is still in operation - Hotel 24 South. This hotel, formerly known as the &quot;Stonewall Jackson Hotel&quot;, was renovated in the early 2000s, and is now in operation as both a hotel and a conference center. The Ingleside Resort is no longer in operation. During World War II it was used by the INS as a detention center for enemy aliens held under Executive Order 9066. Some of the hotels that are no longer in operation are The Virginia Hotel, the Eakleton Hotel, the Valley Hotel, the American Hotel and the Hotel Beverley. All of these buildings are still standing except for the Virginia Hotel, which was demolished in 1930 to make way for a planned addition to the Stonewall Jackson Hotel which was never built. The New Street Parking Garage now stands on the site.

=== National Register of Historic Places ===

Buildings in Staunton on the National Register of Historic Places include:
* Booker T. Washington High School, former high school for &quot;colored&quot; students.
* The Oaks, at 437 East Beverley Street. An 1840s structure, it was modified and enlarged in 1888 by famed Civil War cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss.
* Sears House, a &quot;bracketed cottage&quot; frame house built around 1860.
* Staunton Coca-Cola Bottling Works, former Coca-Cola bottling plant in modernist structure.
* Stuart House, Jefferson-inspired 18th-century Federal-style home.

==Sports==
In 1894, Staunton fielded a baseball team in the original Virginia League: The Staunton Hayseeds. In 1914, the city fielded a team in the Virginia Mountain League: The Staunton Lunatics. The Lunatics moved to Harrisonburg in July 1914, just before the league disbanded. From 1939 to 1942, the city fielded a team in the second Virginia League: the Staunton Presidents. Staunton currently has no minor league baseball, but the Staunton Braves represent the city in the Valley Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league that plays in the Shenandoah Valley.

==Parks and recreation==
* Betsy Bell and Mary Gray Wilderness Parks — a mountaintop park with a observation platform
* Gypsy Hill Park — a multi-use facility with a golf course, football and baseball stadiums, gymnasium, lake, two playgrounds, three youth baseball fields, public swimming pool, volleyball court, horseshoe pits, tennis courts, the Gypsy Express mini-train, the Duck Pond, a skate park, a bandstand, and several pavilions. Until the Staunton city parks were integrated, Gypsy Hill Park was only open to whites except for one day a year, which was set aside for other races to use the park.
* Montgomery Hall Park — a multi-use facility with softball and soccer fields, tennis courts, disc golf course, playgrounds, picnic shelters, hiking and mountain biking trails, and a swimming pool (which was renovated in 2016 after being closed since 2010.) The offices of the Department of Parks and Recreation are at the Irene Givens Administration building, which also includes a kitchen, activity room, and conference room which are available for public use. Montgomery Hall Park was opened in 1950 after much agitation by non-white residents of Staunton. Before segregation ended in the mid-1960s, Montgomery Hall park was the only park in the city open to African-Americans
* Booker T. Washington Community Center — formerly the segregated Booker T. Washington High School, although according to the court which decided Bell v. Staunton Board of Education, the term &quot;high school&quot; was a misnomer, as the school also contained &quot;first, second, and seventh grade classes and two special mentally retarded classes as well as the eighth through the twelfth grades.&quot;
* Nelson Street Teen Center — closed () due to budget cuts.
* Landes Park - a small, one-acre park named after Walter James Landes, Jr. in 1993. Near downtown Staunton.
* Reservoir Hill Park - a small four-acre park located at the old city reservoir.
* Men&#x27;s Green Thumb Park - approximately two acres and was created through a joint sponsorship by the Men&#x27;s Green Thumb Garden Club and United Virginia Bank National Valley, 1960–1970.
* Knowles Park - Knowles Park is a small parcel of land directly across from the main entrance of Gypsy Hill Park.
* Woodrow Park (Sears Hill) - approximately five acres and is located in the Sears Hill District of Staunton. The park was named in honor of President Woodrow Wilson and features a scenic overlook of historic downtown Staunton.

== Government ==














Staunton operates under a council-manager form of government. In 1908, Staunton was the first city in the United States to give an appointed employee authority over city affairs through statute. In 1912, Sumter, South Carolina, was the first U.S. city to implement the council-manager form of city government. The city of Staunton refers to itself on its website as the &quot;birthplace of President Woodrow Wilson, and the city manager form of government.&quot;

The Shenandoah Valley was one of the first areas of the South to break away from a Solid South voting pattern, and Staunton was no exception. It went Republican in every presidential election from 1948 to 2004. In 2008, however, Barack Obama narrowly carried the city, becoming the first Democrat to do so since Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s last victory in 1944. Democrats have won every national and state election in Staunton since then.

Staunton is part of Virginia&#x27;s 6th congressional district.

==Education==

Staunton City Schools is the school district of the city.

Black Virginians were largely barred from education until Reconstruction. The first school in Staunton which allowed African-Americans to attend was established by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau under the supervision of the commanding general of the occupying Union army in late 1865. Arrangements were made to bring in women from the North as teachers, and the jury rooms of the Augusta County Courthouse, located at 1 E. Johnson Street, were to be used as classrooms. The court protested this plan, however, and it is possible that another location was found.

In 1964 the Staunton chapter of the NAACP threatened the city with a lawsuit if they did not immediately desegregate the public schools. The City School Board, headed by Thomas W. Dixon, declined to take further action, contending that the schools were already desegregated as ten black children had been allowed to attend previously all-white schools. Attorneys for the city of Staunton submitted a plan for the desegregation of its public schools in 1965 by eliminating all negro schools in time for the 1967–1968 school year, which was approved by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. However, the implementation of this plan was delayed to such an extent that a group of African-American parents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the city. This case, &quot;Bell v. School Board of Staunton&quot;, was decided on January 5, 1966, with the court stating that the delay was a violation of the rights of the students under the Fourteenth Amendment and ordering that the schools and their faculty be desegregated in time for the 1966–1967 school year.

The Staunton city school district was one of 21 in Virginia which take elementary school students out of class for Bible lessons on a voluntary basis, a practice known as Weekday Religious Education. Although the U.S. Supreme Court ended taxpayer-funded religious education in 1948 in &quot;McCollum v. Board of Education&quot;, four years later they opened the door to privately funded voluntary classes held during school hours but away from school premises in &quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot;. In 2005, a group of parents in Staunton asked the school board to halt the practice. The challenge was successful, and the Bible classes are no longer being taught as of April 2017.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====
The main highways through Staunton include U.S. Route 11, U.S. Route 11 Business, U.S. Route 250, Virginia State Route 252, Virginia State Route 254, Virginia State Route 261 and Virginia State Route 262. U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 250 are the most prominent roads passing directly through Staunton, with US 11 following a northeast to southwest alignment (but signed north–south), and US 250 following a northwest to southeast alignment (but signed east–west). US 11 Business follows a slower route through downtown compared to the main US 11 routing which passes just outside downtown. State Routes 252 and 254 are minor roads leading to nearby rural areas of adjacent Augusta County. State Route 261 provides a better route for trucks following US 11 and US 250 through the city. State Route 262 forms a limited access beltway around the outskirts of Staunton. Interstate 64 and Interstate 81 both pass just outside the city limits and provide the main high-speed, high-volume roads to the Staunton region.

====Public transportation====
Staunton is served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The train station, which is located downtown, is the closest station to the nearby cities of Harrisonburg and Lexington. The Buckingham Branch also has a small railyard.

Staunton had a municipal bus system during the 20th century, known as the Staunton Transit Service, but it was dissolved in 1989. In 1944, World War II veteran S. Melvin Johnson wrote to Truman Gibson, assistant to William H. Hastie, advisor to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, regarding segregated seating on the Staunton Transit Service and stating that returning African-American soldiers would not stand for such conditions. This letter was an indication of the role that African-American veterans would later play in the American civil rights movement. In 1946, after the United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, which found that Virginia&#x27;s segregated seating law was unconstitutional with respect to interstate bus routes, Ethel New, a black woman from Lynch, Kentucky, was arrested for violating the law because she had purchased an intrastate ticket. New suffered a miscarriage subsequent to her arrest and sued Greyhound Lines and the arresting officer in Staunton. In September 1947, meeting in Staunton, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the all-white jury&#x27;s verdict exonerating both the bus line and the officer.

Blue Ridge Intercity Transit Express (BRITE) provides fixed-route transit bus service in Staunton on three routes: the Downtown Trolley, West Route, and North Route. The Coordinated Area Transportation Services (CATS) operates a demand-response service throughout the Staunton area, as well as a fixed shuttle service between the downtown areas of Staunton and Waynesboro. Virginia Breeze provides intercity bus service between Blacksburg and Washington, with a stop in Staunton.

The city is adjacent to the northernmost junction of I-81 and I-64. Virginia State Route 262 forms a partial beltway around the city, and both US 250 and US 11 pass through the city.

The nearest commercial airport is Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport in Weyers Cave, Virginia.

<text>This list of Game Boy Color games includes  licensed releases from the Game Boy Color&#x27;s launch in 1998 to the final release in 2003. The last official release for the system was &quot;Doraemon no Study Boy: Kanji Yomikaki Master&quot;, which was released in Japan on July 18, 2003. However, multiple unlicensed games (many of which are developed and distributed by fans) have been released since then. Additionally, there were several games which were developed and officially licensed, but were cancelled before release.

Games were released under two classes of cartridges: Class A, &quot;Dual Mode&quot; cartridges compatible with Game Boy systems which predate the Game Boy Color. They feature the text &quot;Yes&quot; in the column indicating two versions of the game included on the cartridges. The backs of the boxes for such games are labeled &quot;Compatible with Game Boy&quot; and the cartridges of these games are typically molded in black to distinguish them from original Game Boy cartridges. Many of them also have special borders and/or limited color support for the Super Game Boy peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Class B cartridges were compatible only with the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and the Game Boy Player peripheral for the GameCube. They feature the text &quot;No&quot; in the column indicating Dual Mode. Such games typically feature the disclaimers &quot;Only for Game Boy Color&quot; and &quot;Not compatible with other Game Boy systems!&quot; on their box art or sometimes on the cartridge.

This list is organized alphabetically by the games&#x27; localized English titles, or by &quot;rōmaji&quot; transliterations when exclusive to Japan. The releases are sorted into 3 main regions (Japan, North America, and European Union/PAL region), specifying if certain European games had country-specific distribution. There is also one game exclusive to the country of South Korea.

<doc id="708276" wikidata="Q7238930" url="?curid=708276" title="Praxis (Byzantine Rite)">
<text>Praxis, a transliteration of the Greek word (derived from the stem of the verb , &quot;to do, to act&quot;), means &quot;practice, action, doing&quot;. More particularly, it means either:
# practice, as distinguished from theory, of an art, science, etc.; or practical application or exercise of a branch of learning;
# habitual or established practice; custom.

== Orthodoxy and orthopraxis ==
Eastern Christian writers, especially those in the Byzantine tradition, use the term &quot;praxis&quot; to refer to what others, using an English rather than a Greek word, call &#x27;practice of the faith&#x27;, especially with regard to ascetic and liturgical life.

Praxis is a key to understanding the Byzantine tradition, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Eastern Catholic Churches. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint Maximus the Confessor: &quot;Theology without action is the theology of demons.&quot;

Union with God, to which Eastern Christians hold that Jesus invites mankind, requires not just faith, but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the Scriptures (1 Cor 11:2,
2 Thes 2:14) and the Church Fathers, and is linked with the term &#x27;praxis&#x27; in Byzantine theology and vocabulary. In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is not mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of &#x27;theory and practice&#x27;. Rather, it comprehends all that Orthodox do, and is considered to be &#x27;living Orthodoxy&#x27;.

Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with worship. &quot;Orthopraxis&quot; is said to mean &quot;right glory&quot; or &quot;right worship&quot;, and is then synonymous with orthodoxy; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness of glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of liturgy (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the West, Christianity has been reduced &quot;to intellectual, ethical or social categories,&quot; whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the Body of Christ and providing the path to &quot;true religious education.&quot; A &quot;symbiosis of worship and work&quot; is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis.

Fasting, another key part of the practice of the Christian faith, is mentioned as part of Byzantine praxis, in connection with the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 6), and in comparison with the history and commemorations of Lenten fasts.

Praxis may also refer to proper religious etiquette.

== Corresponding terminology in Latin Christianity ==
In the Latin Church, parallel ideas of asceticism and worship exist. The word used in this regard is the regular English word &quot;practice&quot;, since in English the term &quot;praxis&quot; is not normally used in this sense.

The simplest and most common understanding of the term &quot;practising Catholic&quot;, a minimal interpretation of the phrase, is that the person has been baptized (or canonically received into full communion with the Catholic Church) and strives to observe the Church&#x27;s precept of attending celebration of the Mass or Divine Liturgy on Sundays and holy days of obligation. Someone who does not fulfil even this minimum requirement for being considered &quot;practising&quot; is referred to as a lapsed Catholic.

A more ample indication of what practice involves is given in a statement by Bishop Luc Matthys of Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Living the Catholic faith involves much more than the minimum requirements referred to above.

Matters such as fasting have applications that vary according to place and according to the autonomous particular Church to which a person belongs. In each of the Eastern Catholic Churches, practice is generally the same as in the associated Eastern Church with which it is not in full communion. Thus, practice in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite is identical with that described above for the Churches that constitute the Eastern Orthodox Church, but differs from that of, for instance, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. Within the Latin Church too, there are variations in such matters in accordance with rules laid down by the episcopal conferences in view of local conditions and traditions.

== Modern meaning of &quot;praxis&quot; ==
In English, the word &quot;praxis&quot; is more commonly used in the sense not of practice but with the meaning given to it by Immanuel Kant, namely application of a theory to cases encountered in experience or reasoning about what there should be as opposed to what there is: this meaning Karl Marx made central to his philosophical ideal of transforming the world through revolutionary activity. Proponents of Latin American liberation theology have used the word &quot;praxis&quot; with specific reference to human activity directed towards transforming the conditions and causes of poverty. Their &quot;liberation theology&quot; consists then in applying the Gospel to that praxis to guide and govern it.

<doc id="708278" wikidata="Q7188148" url="?curid=708278" title="Phronema">
<text>Phronema is a transliteration of the Greek word φρόνημα, which has the meanings of &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, and can have either a positive meaning (&quot;high spirit&quot;, &quot;resolution&quot;, &quot;pride&quot;) or a bad sense (&quot;presumption&quot;, &quot;arrogance&quot;).

In the New Testament, the word is used four times in Saint Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Romans: twice with &quot;τῆς σαρκός&quot; (of the flesh) and twice with &quot;τοῦ πνεύματος&quot; (of the spirit): &quot;for the &quot;mind&quot; of the flesh [is] death, and the &quot;mind&quot; of the Spirit – life and peace; because the &quot;mind&quot; of the flesh [is] enmity to God [...] and He who is searching the hearts hath known what [is] the &quot;mind&quot; of the Spirit&quot; (Romans 8:6-
27).

== Eastern Orthodox theology ==

The term &quot;phronema&quot; is used in Eastern Orthodox theology for one particular &quot;mindset&quot; or &quot;outlook&quot; – the &quot;Eastern Orthodox mind&quot;. The attaining of &quot;phronema&quot; in this sense is a matter of practicing the correct faith (&quot;orthodoxia&quot;) in the correct manner (&quot;orthopraxis&quot;). Attaining &quot;phronema&quot; is regarded as the first step toward &quot;theosis&quot;, the state of &quot;glorification&quot;.

&quot;Phronema&quot; is also the name of the official annual review of St Andrew&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Theological College, Sydney, Australia. It presents articles and book reviews from Orthodox and non-Orthodox on topics with central reference to theology, Church history and Orthodoxy.

== Use by John Henry Newman ==

The term was used by John Henry Newman in an article published in 1859 under the title &quot;On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine&quot;. He said that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the faithful is to be regarded as &quot;a sort of instinct, or &quot;phronēma&quot;, deep in the bosom of the mystical body of Christ&quot;.

== Use by Ernst Haeckel ==

The term was used by Ernst Haeckel in his book &quot;The Wonders of Life&quot; where (p. 342) the phronema is the name given to a part of the cortex, as “the real organ of mind”.

<text>I Am My Own Wife is a play by Doug Wright based on his conversations with the German antiquarian Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. The one-person play premiered Off-Broadway in 2003 at Playwrights Horizons. It opened on Broadway later that year. The play was developed with Moisés Kaufman and his Tectonic Theater Project, and Kaufman also acted as director. Jefferson Mays starred in the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, playing some forty roles. Wright received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work.

With his play &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot;, Wright tied in with the film &quot;I Am My Own Woman&quot; by avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim (1992). Film and play are based on von Mahlsdorf&#x27;s autobiography, first issued in 1992, translated in 1995.

== Plot synopsis ==
&quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; is an examination of the life of German antiquarian Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, who killed her father when she was a young child and survived the Nazi and Communist regimes in East Berlin as a transgender woman.

&quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; began with Moises Kauffman and Doug Wright at About Face Theatre in Chicago in 2002, and moved to Broadway in 2004 where it won the Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Play (Mays) and for Best Play. It was first produced as a workshop in July 2001 at the La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California.

==Premieres==
In 2004, the play had its European premiere at the Stockholm City Theatre, Stockholm, starring Björn Kjellman. In 2005, it had its American regional premiere at Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati, starring Todd Almond. That production then traveled to Actors Theatre of Louisville and Florida Studio Theatre. In 2006, the play was staged in Hudson, New York at Stageworks/Hudson starring Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn, in Toronto, Ontario, at CanStage, with Stephen Ouimette in the starring role, in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Playhouse Theatre with Canadian actor Tom Rooney, at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal with actor Brett Christopher, in Portland, Oregon, at the Gerding Theater starring actor Wade McCollum, in Portland, Maine, at the Portland Stage Company starring actor Tom Ford, and in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the Performance Network Theatre starring actor Malcolm Tulip. In January 2007, the San Pedro Playhouse in San Antonio, Texas successfully mounted the play. It was also performed at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey from January 16, 2007, to February 11, 2007. It featured Mark Nelson, and was directed by Anders Cato. Vince Gatton performed the role in a production directed by Andrew Volkoff at Barrington Stage Company in 2008. A French translation (&quot;Ma femme, c&#x27;est moi&quot;) was performed in February 2009 at Théâtre du Rideau Vert in Montreal. It also ran at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, starring Helen Hayes award winner Andrew Long, and directed by Alan Paul, and at Theater Three in Port Jefferson, New York, featuring Jeffrey Sanzel.

Between May 6 and May 23, 2009, it played in Tasmania at the Earl Arts Centre in Launceston, and the Theatre Royal, Hobart Backspace, produced by the Tasmanian Theatre Company and featuring Robert Jarman.

In the Czech Republic, the play was premiered in 2008 by Divadlo Letí in Prague, starring Pavol Smolárik. At the same time it was also staged by a Czech non-professional theater group with Libor Ulovec in the role. The latter was awarded the Best Czech Non-Professional Drama Performance 2009 and Libor Ulovec received (among others) the Best Czech Non-Professional Actor Prize 2009.

In Mexico it is starring by the actor Hector Bonilla who, on January 23, 2010, accomplished 100 performances, with 89 standing ovations by that time. It was also performed in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, at Gettysburg Stage starring actor Eric Jones.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the play was part of the renowned Jungle Theater&#x27;s 2011–2012 season. It was directed by Joel Sass in that venue, and Bradley Greenwald embodied the stageful of characters in an amazing tour de force performance. It ran from November 4 though December 18.

In Greece, &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; had its premiere in January 2011, in Bios Basement, Athens. It was produced by Degreezero Theatre Company, translated and directed by Iossif Vardakis and performed by Haris Attonis with the original music of Marietta Fafouti who also composed a special song for the show, named &quot;Ich Erinnere Mich&quot; — lyrics by Dimitris Dimopoulos. It went on for 20 performances and carried on for the following season, moving to 104 theatre, in Athens and opening in November 2011 for the second run. It has received great acceptance and outstanding critiques both for the whole of the show but for Haris Attonis&#x27; exceptional performance, as well. The play itself and the story of Charlotte are very well-timed with the political and social situation in Greece. The staging itself is very minimal and it has been considered to be one of the most emotional presentations, internationally and there have been innovations like the beard and the lack of the head scarf, for the very first time. Haris Attonis won the 2012 Best Male Theatre Performance Award for &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; in Athens Voice Best Choice and Audience Awards and Marietta Fafouti won the 2012 Best Original Theatre Music for &quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; in the Gay Theatre Awards.

&quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; returned to Chicago&#x27;s About Face Theatre in November 2016 in a re-imagined production directed by artistic director Andrew Volkoff using four actors and featuring Delia Kropp in the role of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. This production marks the first known professional performance of the role by a trans actor. It was met with high praise from area critics as well as the author.

&quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; opened on March 14, 2019, at Out Front Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia featuring Peter Smith playing all roles in the show. This production marked the first professional production where a trans/gender-non-conforming performer portrays all characters in the piece.

A production in 2020 at the Long Wharf Theatre, New Haven, starred Mason Alexander Park.

&quot;I Am My Own Wife&quot; opened at Spokane&#x27;s Stage Left Theater on April 9, 2021. Transgender actress Maeve Griffith performed all roles. The play was directed by Troy Nickerson. The production was performed worldwide over the Internet due to COVID-19 restrictions.

<text>Macarius of Egypt (c. 300 – 391) was a Christian monk and grazer hermit. He is also known as Macarius the Elder or Macarius the Great.

==Life==
Macarius was born in Lower Egypt. A late tradition places his birthplace in the village of Shabsheer (Shanshour), Roman Egypt around 300 AD. He tended cattle as a boy. As a young man, with a strong call to solitude, he constructed near his home a small cell where he prayed continually and wove mats. At some point before his pursuit of asceticism, Macarius made his living smuggling saltpeter in the vicinity of Nitria, a vocation which taught him how to survive in and travel across the wastes in that area.

Macarius is known for his wisdom. His friends and close kin used to call him &quot;Paidarion Geron&quot; (, which when compounded as &quot;Paidiogeron&quot; led to , &quot;Pidar Yougiron&quot;) which meant the &quot;old young man&quot;, i.e. &quot;the young man with the elders&#x27; wisdom.&quot;

At the wish of his parents Macarius entered into marriage, but was soon widowed. Shortly after, his parents died as well. Macarius subsequently distributed all his money among the poor and needy. He found a teacher in an experienced Elder, who lived in the desert not far from the village. The Elder accepted the youth, guided him in the spiritual science of watchfulness, fasting and prayer, and taught him the handicraft of weaving baskets. 

A while later, a pregnant woman accused him of having defiled her. Macarius did not attempt to defend himself, and accepted the accusation in silence. However, when the woman&#x27;s delivery drew near, her labor became exceedingly difficult. She did not manage to give birth until she confessed Macarius&#x27;s innocence. A multitude of people then came asking for his forgiveness, but he fled to the Nitrian Desert to escape all mundane glory.

As a hermit, Macarius spent seven years living on only pulse and raw herbs. He spent the following three years consuming four or five ounces of bread a day and only one vessel of oil a year. While at the desert, he visited Anthony the Great and learned from him the laws and rules of monasticism. When he returned to the Scetic Desert at the age of forty, he became a priest. The fame of his sanctity drew many followers. The community, which took up its residence in the desert, was of the semi-eremitical type. The monks were not bound by any fixed rule; their cells were close together, and they met for Divine worship only on Saturdays or Sundays. He presided over this monastic community for the rest of his life. 

For a brief period of time, Macarius was banished to an island in the Nile by the Emperor Valens, along with Macarius of Alexandria, during a dispute over the doctrine of the Nicene Creed. Both men were victims of religious persecution by the followers of then Bishop Lucius of Alexandria. During their time on the island, the daughter of a pagan priest had become ill. The people of the island believed that she was possessed by an evil spirit. Both saints prayed over the daughter, which in turn had saved her. The pagan people of the island were so impressed and grateful that they stopped their worship of the pagan gods and built a church. When word of this got back to the Emperor Valens and Bishop Lucius of Alexandria, they quickly allowed both men to return home. At their return on 13 Paremhat, they were met by a multitude of monks of the Nitrian Desert, numbered fifty thousand, among whom were Pishoy and John the Dwarf.

==Death and relics==
Macarius died in the year 391. After his death, the natives of his village of Shabsheer stole the body and built a great church for him in their village. Pope Michael V of Alexandria brought the relics of Saint Macarius back to the Nitrian Desert on 19 Mesori. Today, the body of Macarius is found in his monastery, the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in Scetes, Egypt.

==Legacy==
Macarius is a saint in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches.

In the Methodist Churches, Macarius is regarded highly for writing on the topic of entire sanctification.

Macarius of Egypt founded a monastery that bears his name, the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great, which has been continuously inhabited by monks since its foundation in the fourth century. St. Macarius’ face used to be enlightened with grace in an amazing way to the extent that many fathers testified that his face used to glow in the dark; and thus appeared his name as “the glowing lantern”. This description was transferred to his monastery, and thus it was called “the glowing lantern of the wilderness” or “the glowing monastery”, which meant the place of high wisdom and constant prayer. Today it belongs to the Coptic Orthodox Church.

The entirety of the Nitrian Desert is sometimes called &quot;the Desert of Macarius&quot;, for he was the pioneer monk in the region. The ruins of numerous monasteries in this region support the local tradition that the cloisters of Macarius were equal in number to the days of the year.
Macarius the Great, one of the Egyptian desert recluses and a disciple of Anthony the Great, is depicted on the right edge of the Triumph of Death fresco in Pisa. A group of leisurely aristocrats and their animals occupy the central part of the fresco. These rich young men and women riding horses, surrounded by their decorative hunting dogs have gone on a pleasant journey. Suddenly, their path, somewhere deep in the woods, is barred by three open sarcophagi with bodies in different degrees of decomposition. Everybody in the scene, including the men, women and even the animals are horrified by this terrible and palpable presence of death. The unsupportable stench hits their noses. The abhorrent scene dismays them. Only Macarius the Great, made wise and powerful by his faith, stands above them all. The mystic teaches the youngsters a lesson about life and death by reading from the scroll. The Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini was inspired by this depiction of Macarius in his painted portrait.

<text>Saint Macarius of Alexandria (Greek: Μακάριος; died 395) was a monk in the Nitrian Desert. He was a slightly younger contemporary of Macarius of Egypt, and is thus also known as Macarius the Younger.

==Life==
Macarius was born about the year 300 in Alexandria. He was a merchant selling confections until the age of 40, when he was baptized and went off into the desert. After several years of ascetic life, he was ordained a presbyter and appointed prior of a monastery known as the &quot;Kellii&quot;, or &quot;cells&quot; in the Egyptian desert, between the Nitria mountain and a skete in which monastic hermits lived in silence, each in his own cell.

About the year 335, Macarius of Alexandria retired to live alone as a recluse in el-Natroun desert. Many miracles were ascribed to him. He presided over five thousand Nitric monks.

Having learned of the extremely strict rule for monastic life observed at the Tabbenesiot Monastery, whose prior was Venerable St. Pachomios the Great (+ 348), St. Macarius disguised himself in secular clothing, and over the course of the entire Quadragesima [the 40-day Great Lent] neither ate bread nor drank water. No one saw him eating or sitting down. He was making baskets of palm leaves while he was standing. The monks said to Saint Pachomius: &quot;Cast out this man from here, for he is not human.&quot; A divine inspiration subsequently revealed Macarius&#x27; identity to him, and the monks rushed to receive his blessings. Having demonstrated humility and taught a lesson to all, St. Macarius returned to his own monastery.

At the age of 73 Macarius of Alexandria was exiled by Emperor Valens, along with Macarius of Egypt to an island, which they subsequently Christianized.

According to Eastern Orthodox tradition, Macarius of Alexandria died on 2 January 395. According to the Coptic Orthodox tradition, he died on 1 May 395. (6 Pashons, 111 A.M.)

In addition to a monastic rule and three brief apothegms, a homily &quot;On the End of the Souls of the Righteous and of Sinners&quot; is ascribed to him, although excellent Vienna manuscripts assign the latter to a monk named Alexander. Palladius and Sozomen also mention a Macarius the Younger of Lower Egypt, who lived in a cell for more than twenty three years to atone for a murder which he had committed.

<text>The Quinn River, once known as the Queen River, is an intermittent river, approximately long, in the desert of northwestern Nevada in the United States. It drains an enclosed basin inside the larger Great Basin.

It rises in northeastern Humboldt County, on the west side of the Santa Rosa Range, just south of the Oregon state line. Its course flows southwest, through the main Nevada lands of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes and then south and southwest, receiving the Kings River flowing south from Kings River Valley. The Quinn River evaporates in a sink at the Black Rock Desert, south of the Black Rock Range.

== Catchment ==
The Quinn River is the largest river in the region, starting in the Santa Rosa Range and ending in the Quinn River Sink on the playa south of the Black Rock Range. The watershed covers including the Upper and Lower Quinn River, Smoke Creek Desert, Massacre Lake, and Thousand Creek/Virgin Valley watersheds of northwestern Nevada as well as small parts across the border of Oregon.

== Quinn River Sink==
The Quinn River Sink is the mouth of the Quinn River and is a geographic sink of around , where the Quinn River discharges and evaporates about south-southwest of Black Rock Hot Springs.

<doc id="708307" wikidata="Q2962885" url="?curid=708307" title="Chetco River">
<text>The Chetco River is a stream located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains approximately of Curry County. Flowing through a rugged and isolated coastal region, it descends rapidly from about to sea level at the Pacific Ocean. Except for the lowermost , the river is located entirely within the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. The river rises in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, northwest of Chetco Peak at the junction of the Oregon Coast Range and the Klamath Mountains. It flows generally north, west, and then southwest, before emptying into the ocean between Brookings and Harbor, approximately north of the California state line. The Chetco River&#x27;s watershed remains largely undeveloped, protected by the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The upper of the river have been designated Wild and Scenic since 1988.

Native Americans have lived in the Chetco River&#x27;s watershed for the last one to three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19th centuries, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water.

Supporting a large population of salmon and trout, the Chetco&#x27;s water is of very high quality. The watershed is home to many other species, including several that are endemic to the Siskiyou Mountains area. The northernmost grove of Redwoods—the tallest trees on Earth—grow in the southern region of the Chetco&#x27;s drainage basin. In total, the river is home to over 200 species of animals, and 97 percent of the watershed is forested.

==Course==
The Chetco River begins about east of Chetco Peak, approximately above sea level. It flows north, gathering small tributaries such as the Little Chetco River and Babyfoot Creek. The river turns west near the Pearsoll Peak, the highest point in the watershed. It receives Box Canyon Creek on the , Tincup Creek on the , and Boulder Creek on the left. It then flows south, gathering the South Fork Chetco River. A few miles farther south, the river passes through a Redwood grove. It flows between Bosley Butte to the north and Mount Emily to the south; the latter is the impact site of one of only four bombs known to have been dropped in the continental United States by an enemy aircraft. This occurred during the Lookout Air Raids of 1942.

Turning southwest, the river flows through Alfred A. Loeb State Park and collects the North Fork Chetco River on the right at river mile (RM) 5 (or river kilometer (RK) 8). The Chetco becomes an estuary about from its mouth. It passes through the communities of Brookings to the north and Harbor to the south, and discharges into the Pacific Ocean.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of the Chetco River at a stream gauge at RM 10.7 (RK 17.2), which is northeast of Brookings. It opened in 1969, and continues to operate. The average flow was from a drainage area of , about 77 percent of the Chetco&#x27;s total drainage basin. The maximum recorded flow was on December 22, 1964, during the Pacific Northwest flood of 1964. The minimum flow was on October 14, 1987.

==Watershed==

The Chetco River drains of the southern Oregon Coast. About 78 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service, and another 5 percent is owned by the Bureau of Land Management. Sixteen percent is privately owned, while the remaining one percent is managed by the cities of Brookings and Harbor, Curry County, and the state of Oregon. Approximately 97 percent of the land is used for forestry, 2 percent for agriculture and rural areas, and 1 percent is urban. Gravel and minerals are mined from the lower and upper regions of the watershed, respectively.

The region is mostly mountainous, characterized by steep river valleys. Elevations in the Chetco River watershed range from sea level to at the summit of Pearsoll Peak. Precipitation averages between per year, with October through June being the wettest months. Seventy percent of surface runoff is collected from rain, and 30 percent from rain on snow. Twenty-five separate wetlands totaling have been identified in the watershed. Temperatures average between , although the Brookings effect (or Chetco effect; similar to a foehn wind) often brings localized hot weather to the Brookings area. The increase in temperature is caused by the geography of the region; cool air funnels down the Chetco River valley from the Siskiyou and Coast ranges, gradually heating up before eventually reaching Brookings as a warm wind. The mountains also shield the area from cool marine layers. Partially as a result of this phenomenon, Brookings recorded its highest temperature ever, , on July 8, 2008.

Earthquakes are common, and large-scale ones occur around every 300 years. The Cascadia earthquake of 1700—estimated at 8.7–9.2 on the moment magnitude scale—caused a tsunami to sweep across California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, reaching Japan the next day. It was produced when the entire Cascadia subduction zone, about long, slipped approximately in a megathrust event. Another major earthquake occurred in 1873 near present-day Brookings. With a magnitude of 7.3, the quake was felt from Seattle to San Francisco. Wind is also a factor in the region; storms can sometimes reach over . The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 brought devastating winds to nearly all of Oregon; nearby Port Orford recorded gusts exceeding . The storm killed 38 people across the state and caused over $200 million worth of damage. The watershed often experiences wildfires, some of them major. The Biscuit Fire of 2002 burned over of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and surrounding regions.

As of the 2010 census, the city of Brookings had a population of 6,336, while nearby Harbor had 2,391. In total, over 14,000 residents of the Brookings–Harbor area depend on the Chetco River for drinking water. Nearby watersheds include the Winchuck and Smith rivers to the south, the Pistol River to the north, and the Illinois River, a tributary of the Rogue River, to the north and east.

==Flora and fauna==

The Chetco River watershed is covered primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes species such as Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.

The most prevalent species of the extreme southern portion of the watershed is the coastal redwood, one of the tallest types of trees on Earth. The world&#x27;s northernmost redwood grove is located near the south bank of the Chetco at RM 15 (RK 24), about north of the California border. Trees here are around 300 to 800 years old, in diameter, and some exceed tall. The redwoods were heavily logged in the early 20th century. Prior to logging, the massive trees created their own microclimate by capturing moisture from fog, and also by the immense amount of shade they produced. The redwoods region is less mountainous than the rest of the watershed, and meandering streams are much more common.

Over 200 species of animals inhabit the river and its tributaries. Birds such as loons, grebes, ducks, kingfishers, and bald eagles are known to live around streams and other regions of the watershed. Auks, gulls, and terns have been spotted around the river&#x27;s mouth, and black-legged kittiwakes nest in the area during the winter. The wildlife in the Kalmiopsis region of the Chetco watershed is more diverse than that of any other region in Oregon. Mammals such as American black bears, black-tailed deer, bobcats, ring-tailed cats, and gray foxes are common inhabitants of this region. The rare Siskiyou chipmunk is endemic to the Klamath Mountains. Steelhead and chinook and coho salmon are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit the Chetco River. Steelhead are abundant and have been spotted in most major and minor streams. Chinook salmon usually travel as far as Boulder Creek, about halfway between the Chetco&#x27;s headwaters and its mouth. Coho also generally stay in this area, but some have been found in the Granite and Carter Creek area, about above Boulder Creek. Coastal cutthroat trout can be found all around the watershed; some migrate to the ocean, while others live in the river and its tributaries year round. Pacific lamprey, three-spined stickleback, and various sculpins have also been observed.

==Geology==

The Chetco River flows through the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100 million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath microcontinent was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating hundreds of millions of years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170 million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165 million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth&#x27;s crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

The mountainous terrain of the Chetco River watershed was created approximately 130 million years ago when the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.

Today, sandstone, shale, granite, and serpentine are the primary rock types in the Chetco region. Various forms of loam comprise its soil. Erosion levels are high due to a combination of high precipitation, steep slopes, and landslides, which can result in earthflows.

==History==

Humans have lived in the Chetco River watershed since approximately 1,000 to 3,000 years ago. The first inhabitants were perhaps ancestors of the Chetco Indians and other Native American tribes, themselves descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia over 10,000 years ago. At least nine separate villages were constructed along the Chetco River, including two on either side of its mouth. The Native Americans named the river &quot;chit taa-ghii~-li~&#x27;&quot;.

The first European American to visit the area may have been Sir Francis Drake on June 5, 1579, during his circumnavigation of the world. The Vancouver Expedition also explored the area in 1792. In June 1828 Jedediah Smith and his company of fur traders camped on the south bank of the river near a Native American village. Between 1853 and 1855, many Native Americans were killed and their villages destroyed in skirmishes occurring around the same time as the nearby Rogue River Wars. On July 9, 1856, the remaining Chetco were marched north to the Siletz Reservation.

Oregon—and therefore the Chetco watershed—was jointly occupied by the United Kingdom and the United States after the Treaty of 1818 was signed. The Oregon Treaty was ratified in 1846, giving the United States ownership of Oregon. Soon after, the Oregon Territory was established, and Oregon became a U.S. state on February 14, 1859.

The discovery of gold and other precious metals in the watershed brought settlers to the region in the 1840s and 1850s. Nickel, cobalt, and chromium were also mined. The town of Harbor was founded on the south bank of the Chetco River in 1891, and a ferry service across the river opened in 1904. It was shut down in 1915 when the Chetco Bridge opened. In 1912, the Brookings Lumber &amp; Box Company moved north from the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California to the southern Oregon coast region. The company constructed a sawmill in 1914, and founded the town of Brookings. Brookings was not incorporated until 1951. The region remained relatively isolated due to its mountainous terrain until 1924, when Highway 101 was extended from Crescent City, California, to Brookings. In 1932, the Isaac Lee Patterson Bridge was completed over the Rogue River to the north, connecting the region to the rest of the Oregon coast. In 1917, a wharf was built at the mouth of the river. Jetties were constructed on either side of its mouth by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1957.

The Siskiyou National Forest was created on October 5, 1906, protecting the entire upper portion of the Chetco watershed. The nearby Rogue River National Forest was combined with it in 2004, creating the nearly Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. In 1964, the United States Congress set aside over of the eastern Chetco River watershed and surrounding regions to create the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. The wilderness was expanded several times in the 1970s, and now encompasses over .
On October 28, 1988, a stretch of the Chetco River was designated a National Wild and Scenic River, from its headwaters to the boundary of the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. In a court case in 1994, the Chetco was determined to be navigable. In 2002, over of the eastern portion of the watershed and surrounding regions were destroyed in the Biscuit Fire. Originally five separate fires, it was caused by several lightning strikes between July 12 and 15. By August 17, all five had burned together, creating one massive fire. It burned for over five months and was not fully extinguished until December 31.

In 2002, of land on the Little Chetco River were sold to Washington real estate developer David Rutan, only several months after the Biscuit Fire tore through the region. He opened a gold mining camp on the site in 2007, flying in customers by helicopter. Curry County officials soon stated that the camp violated zoning and sanitation laws, but inspections were stymied because of the area&#x27;s inaccessibility. Rutan bought several more claims in the Wild and Scenic section of the Chetco River in the following years, beginning inside the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, and ending downstream. Despite environmentalists&#x27; concerns, he proposed mining the Chetco riverbed for gold and minerals via commercial suction dredges, permitted by the General Mining Act of 1872. In 2010, the Chetco River was identified as the seventh most endangered river in America by advocacy organization American Rivers, facing a threat of &quot;motorized instream mining&quot;. Oregon&#x27;s governor, Ted Kulongoski, two senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and congressman Peter DeFazio all asked the United States Department of Agriculture to withdraw the Chetco River from the 1872 Mining Act, thus preventing mineral mining on the river. However, Rutan forfeited his claims by not paying his annual filing fees to the Bureau of Land Management in 2011.

==Pollution==

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has monitored the Chetco River for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, oxygen saturation, pH, nutrients, bacteria, chemical contaminants such as pesticides and metals, turbidity, and alkalinity. Streams that exceed the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the Clean Water Act. The Chetco from Box Canyon Creek to its mouth exceeded the standard level for temperature and turbidity. The North Fork, South Fork, and other tributaries were also listed for temperature and turbidity. All tributaries of the Chetco usually exceed the temperature standard. Water temperatures range from at Bosley Creek to at Willow Bar. High turbidity levels in the Chetco River watershed are usually caused by landslides, various forms of erosion, and plugged road culverts.

On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Chetco River at RM 10.8 (RK 17.4) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 (excellent) in the summer and 90 in the fall, winter, and spring. These scores are comparable to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93. Despite the excellent ratings, the Chetco River actually ranks as the second most polluted stream in Curry County, after Floras Creek, a tributary of the New River.

==Recreation==
Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are the primary recreational activities in the watershed. Whitewater kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high. Several trails are maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, as well as other regions in the watershed. Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south fork and its mouth. Alfred A. Loeb State Park, located on the banks of the Chetco, has three cabins and 48 camping sites.

Several large parks are located in Brookings. The Azalea Park in Brookings features five species of wild azaleas. The park was designated an Oregon State Park in 1939, but was given to Brookings in 1993. It hosts the American Music Festival from June until September. The Nature&#x27;s Coastal Holiday light show is displayed in Azalea Park every December. Chetco Point Park, located near the wharf, has several fire rings and picnic tables, as well as views of the river, the Pacific Ocean, and the Port of Brookings Harbor. It is home to the rare Wolf&#x27;s Evening Primrose.

<text>Macarius Magnes (), sometimes referred to as Macarius of Magnesia, is the author of a work of Christian apologetics contesting the writings of a Neo-Platonic philosopher. He was unknown for centuries until the discovery of a manuscript at Athens in 1867. This work is called () in Greek, and &quot;Apocriticus&quot; in Latin. It agrees in its dogmatics with Gregory of Nyssa, and is valuable on account of the numerous excerpts from the writings of the pagan opponent of Macarius. Macarius does not directly name the &quot;Hellene&quot; he is quoting from and criticizing, but it is most commonly speculated to be the philosopher Porphyry, who wrote a lost work called &quot;Against the Christians&quot;. The other named possibility mentioned is Hierocles&#x27;s the &quot;Lover of Truth&quot;. It is also possible that whoever this opponent was, their name was lost to history and otherwise unrecorded in surviving documents.

He may be the Macarius, bishop of Magnesia, who, at the Synod of the Oak in 403, brought charges against Heraclides, bishop of Ephesus, the friend of John Chrysostom, although Adolf Harnack dated him in the late third century.

Like Macarius the Younger, this Macarius is frequently confused with Macarius of Egypt.

==&quot;Apocriticus&quot;==
The manuscript itself of the &quot;Apocriticus&quot; discovered in Athens in 1867 likely dates from the fifteenth century. The work was edited and published by in 1876. Both the time period Macarius lived, as well as that of his opponent, is unclear; the most common speculations are the fourth century for Macarius, and the third century for the Hellene.
Book 1, the first part of Book 2, and Book 5 of the &quot;Apocriticus&quot; are lost, leaving modern audiences with only a fragment of Book 2 and Books 3–4. Fragments of Book 1 and Book 5 survive in quotes elsewhere. The work is generally long quotes of the &quot;Hellene&quot; and their interpretation of Christian works, followed by refutations of their arguments. Book 2 focuses on the gospels; Book 3, further gospel quotes as well as the Acts of the Apostles and Paul; Book 4, further content on Paul&#x27;s works as well as a section on the Apocalypse of Peter and Christian eschatology, angelology, demonology, and so on. The quotation of the Apocalypse of Peter is interesting to modern audiences, as the work was ultimately not included in the eventual list of what would be the New Testament. Similarly, there is no quotation of the General Epistles, 2 Peter, or the Apocalypse of John (Revelation), although it is possible the Hellene did address them, yet Magnes did not quote these attacks, or that they were discussed in Books 1 or 5. In the fourth century, the canon list was still in flux, and the &quot;Apocriticus&quot; provides some insight into both what works the mysterious pagan &quot;Hellene&quot; considered important enough to Christianity to attack, as well as what Macarius Magnes felt should be defended.

<text>The Wailuku River is a water course on the Island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the longest river in Hawai&#x27;i and the largest in the state by mean discharge. Its course lies mostly along the divide between the lava flows of Mauna Kea and those of Mauna Loa to the south. It arises at about the elevation along the eastern slope of Mauna Kea (). It flows generally eastward, descending steeply from the mountain and entering the Pacific Ocean at Hilo.

Wailuku River State Park is located along the lower reach of the river. One section of the park includes Rainbow Falls (), and another section Peepee falls and an area called the Boiling Pots (a series of small falls and pools). It is also one of the deadliest bodies of water in the state, as the river is not guarded and can behave unpredictably.

The lower reach of the river is used for the generation of hydroelectricity. The flow at Hilo averages 275 cubic feet per second (8 m³/s) with peak flows 40 times as great. Water flow is monitored by the USGS. The stream carries an average of 10 tons of suspended sediment into Hilo Bay each day, at .

The river has been the site of sewage leaks and is the subject of water quality research. Water advisories are posted online by the State of Hawaii. There is a plan for restoration of the Hilo Bay watershed that includes characterization of the Wailuku River.

In the Hawaiian language, means fresh water and means destruction, so it means essentially River of Destruction. The river can rise into the trees and drop back down very fast. The high flood marks can be seen dated in concrete, on the stairs going down to the river behind the Hilo Public Library.

According to legend, the river was created in a battle between the god Maui and the lizard monster Kuna.

The river is rated Class 5 white water and has been navigated by experts on kayak.

<doc id="708314" wikidata="Q929275" url="?curid=708314" title="Macarius of Jerusalem">
<text>Macarius I ( &quot;Makarios I Hierosolymōn&quot;) was Bishop of Jerusalem from 312 to shortly before 335, according to Sozomen. He is venerated as a saint within the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church. 

Athanasius, in one of his orations against Arianism, refers to Macarius as an example of &quot;the honest and simple style of apostolical men.&quot; The date 312 for Macarius&#x27;s accession to the episcopate is found in Jerome&#x27;s version of Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s Chronicle. 

About 325 he accompanied Helena Augusta, the mother of Constantine I in her search at Jerusalem for relics of the Passion of Jesus, including the cross on which Jesus of Nazareth was thought to have been crucified.

According to Eusebius, he received a long letter from Constantine with reference to the building of the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem: &quot;Such is our Saviour&#x27;s grace, that no power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his most holy Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his servants now set free through the removal of him who was the common enemy of all, is a fact which truly surpasses all admiration ... And as to the columns and marbles, whatever you shall judge, after actual inspection of the plan, to be especially precious and serviceable, be diligent to send information to us in writing, in order that whatever quantity or sort of materials we shall esteem from your letter to be needful, may be procured from every quarter, as required, for it is fitting that the most marvelous place in the world should be worthily decorated.&quot;

Macarius is listed as one of the bishops to whom Pope Alexander of Alexandria wrote warning against Arius. His death must have been before the Council of Tyre, in 335, at which his successor, Maximus, was apparently one of the bishops present.

==Macarius and Arianism==
Macarius took part in the Council of Nicaea (325), and two conjectures as to the part he played there are worth mentioning. The first is that there was a passage of arms between him and his metropolitan, Eusebius of Caesarea, concerning the rights of their respective sees. The seventh canon of the council — &quot;As custom and ancient tradition show that the bishop of Ælia [Jerusalem] ought to be honoured, he shall have precedence; without prejudice, however, to the dignity which belongs to the Metropolis&quot; — by its vagueness suggests that it was the result of a drawn battle. The second conjecture is that Macarius, together with Eustathius of Antioch, had a good deal to do with the drafting of the Nicene Creed finally adopted by the First Council of Nicæa in 325.

The vigour of his opposition to the theology of Arianism is suggested by the abusive manner in which Arius writes of him in his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia. In the &quot;History of the Council of Nicæa&quot; attributed to Gelasius of Cyzicus there are a number of imaginary disputations between Fathers of the Council and philosophers in the pay of Arius. In one of these disputes where Macarius is spokesman for the bishops he defends the Descent into Hell. This, in view of the question whether the Descent into Hell was found in the Jerusalem Creed, is notable, especially as in other respects Macarius&#x27;s language is made conformable to that Creed. Macarius&#x27;s name appears first among those of the bishops of Palestine who subscribed to the Council of Nicæa; that of Eusebius comes fifth. Athanasius, in his encyclical letter to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, places the name of Macarius (who had been long dead at that time) among those bishops renowned for their orthodoxy. Sozomen narrates that Macarius appointed Maximus, who afterwards succeeded him, Bishop of Lydia, and that the appointment did not take effect because the people of Jerusalem refused to part with Maximus. He also gives another version of the story, to the effect that Macarius himself changed his mind, fearing that, if Maximus was out of the way, an unorthodox bishop would be appointed to succeed him (Macarius). Tillemont discredits this story: Macarius by so acting would have contravened the seventh canon of Nicæa and Aetius, who at the time of the council was Bishop of Lydda, was certainly alive in 331, and very probably in 349. Of course, if Aetius outlived Macarius, the story breaks down; but if he died shortly after 331, it seems plausible enough. The fact that Macarius was then nearing his end would explain the reluctance, whether on his part or that of his flock, to be deprived of Maximus. Tillemont&#x27;s first objection carries no weight. The seventh canon was too vague to secure from an orthodox bishop like Macarius very strict views as to the metropolitan rights of a Semi-Arian like Eusebius.

==Macarius and the Holy Sites==

Theophanes (d. 818) in his &quot;Chronography&quot; makes Constantine, at the end of the Council of Nicæa, order Macarius to search for the sites of the Resurrection and the Passion, and the True Cross. It is likely that this is what happened, for excavations were begun very soon after the council, and, it would seem under the superintendence of Macarius.

The huge mound and stonework with the temple of Venus on the top, which in the time of Hadrian had been piled up over the Holy Sepulchre, were demolished, and &quot;when the original surface of the ground appeared, forthwith, contrary to all expectation, the hallowed monument of our Saviour&#x27;s Resurrection was discovered&quot;. On hearing the news Constantine wrote to Macarius giving lavish orders for the erection of a church on the site. Later on, he wrote another letter &quot;To Macarius and the rest of the Bishops of Palestine&quot; ordering a church to be built at Mambre, which also had been defiled by a pagan shrine. Eusebius, though he gives the superscription as above, speaks of this letter as &quot;addressed to me&quot;, thinking, perhaps of his metropolitan dignity (Vit. Const., III, 51-53). Churches were also built on the sites of the Nativity and Ascension.

==Veneration==

Macarius is recognised as a saint within the Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions. Relics of Saint Macarius, including his skull, are located in Saint Anthony&#x27;s Chapel (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

St. Macarius&#x27; feast day is commemorated on March 10.

<text>The list of rivers in Mississippi includes any rivers that flow through part of the State of Mississippi. The major rivers in Mississippi are the Mississippi River, Pearl River, Pascagoula River and the Tombigbee River, along with their main tributaries: the Tallahatchie River, Yazoo River, Big Black River, Leaf River, and the Chickasawhay River. However, other tributaries vary in size, with some also draining rather sizable areas of Mississippi (&quot;Also see list below:&quot; Alphabetically).

The various rivers, with their tributaries, can be organized by drainage basin, as shown in the related maps below.

==By drainage basin==
This list is arranged by drainage basin, with respective tributaries indented under each larger stream&#x27;s name. All rivers in Mississippi eventually flow into the Gulf of Mexico.

<text>The desk on a frame (or desk on frame) is usually an antique form made up of two pieces of furniture. The first piece is a fairly large and closable portable desk with a slanted hinged top giving access to the writing surface and utility nooks and small drawers. The second piece is a stand made for it in the same style and material. It is also sometimes a single piece of furniture which looks as if it were made up of the two previous pieces but is in fact solid and nondetachable. This form was popular in Colonial America and was often done in the Queen Anne style.

The slant top desk is a direct morphological descendant. In a sense the Spanish Bargueño (or Vargueño) desk is a distant cousin of the two piece version, since the Bargueño is also made up of a portable desk and a stand constructed specially for it, using the same materials and style.

<text>Chetco Peak is a mountain in the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in the southern Kalmiopsis Wilderness in southern Curry County in the extreme southwestern corner of the state, approximately inland from the Pacific Ocean and north of the California state line.

The name of the peak and that of the nearby Chetco River was derived from the name of a small tribe of Native Americans, the Chetco people, who originally lived along the lower Chetco River in Curry County.

<text>Pearsoll Peak is a mountain in the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in the northern Kalmiopsis Wilderness in southeastern Curry County and western Josephine County in the extreme southwest corner of the state, approximately from the Pacific Ocean and north of the California state line. It is the highest point in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and has a historic fire lookout on a false summit a short distance east of the Wilderness Boundary which overlooks the Illinois River Valley. The current lookout structure replaced the original cupola-style building in 1954 and was actively staffed as a fire lookout into the early 1970s. After that, the building fell into disrepair until the Sand Mountain Society, an all-volunteer nonprofit based in Portland, OR, stepped in to restore the L-4 Model lookout cabin in 1991. The group has done meticulous maintenance on the building, starting in 1991. The most recent major Sand Mountain Society effort is still in progress, having been interrupted by recent fire closures and other commitments. 

Remarkably, the fire lookout was spared in three catastrophic fires so far this century: the Biscuit Fire of 2002; the Chetco Bar Fire of 2017 (with trees torching within 100 feet of the building), and; the Klondike Fire of 2018.

<doc id="708330" wikidata="Q3477561" url="?curid=708330" title="Secular Student Alliance">
<text>The Secular Student Alliance (SSA) is an American educational nonprofit organization whose purpose is to educate high school and college students about the value of scientific reason and the intellectual basis of secularism in its atheistic and humanistic manifestations. The SSA also offers these students and their organizations a variety of resources, including leadership training and support, guest speakers, discounted literature and conference tickets, and online articles and opinions. Starting in 2024, Secular Student Alliance partnered with The Satanic Temple, another organization promoting secular values among students, in supporting After School Satan clubs in public schools which also host religious student clubs.

==History==
In 1999, the students on the Executive Council of the Campus Freethought Alliance, along with some other students, faculty advisers, and off-campus supporters, decided that a national student organization needed autonomy (the Campus Freethought Alliance was governed by the Council for Secular Humanism). Therefore, in April 2000, a majority of the members of the Campus Freethought Alliance Executive Council decided to become independent from the Council for Secular Humanism. The Secular Student Alliance was thus founded in May 2000 by eight student leaders from the grassroots secular movement. It was organized under the nonprofit corporation laws of Ohio on November 21, 2001. The corporation&#x27;s principal office is located in Columbus, Ohio.

The SSA is an independent, democratically structured organization in the U.S. that promotes freethinking high school and college students. The SSA was formed &quot;to organize, unite, educate and serve students and student communities that promote the ideals of scientific and critical inquiry, democracy, secularism, and human based ethics&quot;.

In January 2012, the SSA had over 312 affiliates in North America and abroad, including groups in Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia. In June 2013, the SSA announced that with the Freedom from Religion Foundation, it will work on educating students on their rights and will assist with rectifying violations. The SSA is a founding member of the Secular Coalition for America.

In October 2015, SSA tweeted that it &quot;desperately&quot; needed $100,000 by the end of the month. Executive director August Brunsman said fundraising had lagged. In October 2017, shortly after the hiring of new Executive Director Kevin Bolling, the organization relocated from Columbus, Ohio, to Los Angeles.

==Membership growth==
The SSA experienced increasing membership growth from its founding in 2000 until 2012. Since then, it has steadily contracted to 237 groups in 2025. As of May 2018, the SSA&#x27;s Board of Directors has twelve members. The number of SSA community college and university campus affiliates has expanded considerably in recent years:
* 2007 – 80 groups
* 2008 – 100 groups
* 2009 – 159 groups
* 2010 – 219 groups
* 2011 – 240 groups
* 2012 – 413 groups
* 2013 – 407 groups
* 2018 – 276 groups
* 2019 – 312 groups
* 2025 – 237 groups

==Events==
On August 7, 2009, the SSA organized a trip to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. 304 students, atheists, and scientists attended, in order to familiarize themselves with the museum. One notable name in attendance was biologist and science blogger PZ Myers, who also came to experience the museum.

Since 2009, the SSA has held their Annual Leadership Conference over the Summer which aims to train student leaders and group members in leadership skills and grassroots organizing. In 2013, the conference was split into two locations (East and West).

<text>Mount Emily (Tolowa: en-may ) is a mountain in the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in southern Curry County in the extreme southwest corner of the state, near Brookings, approximately from the Pacific Ocean and from the California state line.

==Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site==
On September 9, 1942, the Japanese submarine &quot;I-25&quot; surfaced near Cape Blanco, Oregon, and launched a Yokosuka E14Y &quot;Glen&quot; seaplane piloted by Nubuo Fujita, who dropped incendiary bombs on Mount Emily in an unsuccessful attempt to start a major forest fire. This made Mount Emily the second place in the continental United States to be bombed by an enemy aircraft, with Dutch Harbor occurring three months earlier in Unalaska, Alaska. The site of the bombing was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site&quot; in July 2006.

<text>Custom Coasters International (CCI) was one of the premier wooden roller coaster manufacturers in the world and produced 34 wooden coasters in eleven years — more than any other company in recent times. It was located in West Chester, Ohio.

==History==
Custom Coasters Incorporated opened its doors on September 1, 1991. The company was founded by Denise Dinn-Larrick, the daughter of coaster designer Charles Dinn — founder of the Dinn Corporation, her brother Jeff Dinn and her husband Randy Larrick. The original designers for the company included freelance design engineers Mike Boodley and Bill Kelley of California. Larry Bill, formerly with Curtis D. Summers &amp; Associates joined the design team in 1992. Initially the company promoted small, affordable, family coasters but eventually progressed to larger models known for their speed and intensity. Once the company started working with international clients the name was changed in November 1994 to Custom Coasters International.

CCI filed for bankruptcy in 2002 while still building the New Mexico Rattler at Cliff&#x27;s Amusement Park. Cliff&#x27;s was left with a partially completed coaster and quickly hired the construction crew and completed the ride themselves. No attempt was made to reorganize the company and Denise Dinn, who by then had been divorced from Randy Larrick, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy which resulted in liquidation of the company&#x27;s assets. Denise Dinn was hired by S&amp;S Power to start a new wooden coaster division for that company. Four coasters were produced before that division was closed. Four of the designers for CCI (Larry Bill, Chad Miller, Korey Kiepert, and Michael Graham) founded The Gravity Group in 2002. Other coaster designers Bill Kelley, Dennis McNulty and Mike Boodley left CCI years before the company went bankrupt. Mike Boodley started Great Coasters International in 1994, Dennis McNulty returned to civil engineering in 1999 and Bill Kelley currently works for Dynamic Designs, Inc.

==List of roller coasters==



Over the span of 11 years, Custom Coasters International had built 34 roller coasters around the world. As of 2019, 29 continue to operate, one is closed, two have been demolished, and two have been converted to steel roller coasters (Medusa to Medusa Steel Coaster and Twisted Twins to Wind Chaser) by Rocky Mountain Construction.

The roller coasters in the following table are listed in order of installation.

<text>The Illinois River is a tributary, about long, of the Rogue River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains part of the Klamath Mountains in northern California and southwestern Oregon. The river&#x27;s main stem begins at the confluence of its east and west forks near Cave Junction in southern Josephine County. Its drainage basin includes Sucker Creek, which rises in the Red Buttes Wilderness, near Whiskey Peak on the California state line. The main stem flows generally northwest in a winding course past Kerby and through the Siskiyou National Forest and Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It joins the Rogue River from the south at Agness 4.75 miles NW of the Curry–Josephine county line, (US Geological Survey National Map measure tool) and from the Pacific Ocean, 16.8 miles as the crow flies.

The river&#x27;s lower , from where it enters the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest downstream from Kerby to its confluence with the Rogue River, were designated Wild and Scenic in 1984. Of this, is protected as wild, as scenic, and as recreational.

==Tributaries==
Sucker Creek is named after the state of Illinois, one of whose nicknames is the Sucker State. Miners from Illinois named the creek. In 2011, the United States Forest Service worked on a project to improve the creek. The project is a fishery rehabilitation project.

==Rafting and kayaking==
The Illinois River is &quot;a wilderness river that tests both the skill and strength of boaters&quot;. For the run along the Wild and Scenic part of the river between upper Oak Flat near Kerby and lower Oak Flat, boaters are far from trails and roads. In fact, it is &quot;the most inaccessible river canyon in the lower 48 states...&quot; with sections that are inaccessible, even by trail. Depending on the water flow, this stretch of the river has eight class IV to IV+ rapids. Green Wall, a class V, &quot;is considerably more difficult and longer than the others&quot; and below it lie of difficult rapids. The river is generally run by raft or kayak during the rainy season, October through April. At flows below , boating is difficult because of exposed rocks, and flows above &quot;turn the river into boiling holes and rapids.&quot; A heavy rain can turn an ordinary trip into a high-water nightmare.

Permits from the U.S. Forest Service are required (year round) for river trips on the Wild Section of the river (between Briggs Creek and Nancy Creek) and groups are limited to no more than twelve. However, the permits for non-commercial groups are free and are self issued 24/7, but the permit must also be deposited at Oak Flat to verify the safe completion of the trip. Since there is no dam on the Illinois River, river flows are highly dependent upon weather conditions. Changing weather can often result in water levels being too high or too low for safe and successful navigation. Furthermore, since water levels can rise rapidly, potential bad weather can also be the cause for cancelled or postponed trips. Nevertheless, even under acceptable conditions, the Illinois River can still cause casualties.

<doc id="708346" wikidata="Q584084" url="?curid=708346" title="School of Fontainebleau">
<text>The School of Fontainbleau () () refers to two periods of artistic production in France during the late French Renaissance centered on the royal Palace of Fontainebleau that were crucial in forming Northern Mannerism, and represent the first major production of Italian Mannerist art in France.
The &quot;First School of Fontainebleau&quot;, much more important than the Second School at the end of the century, was based in the chateau from 1531 to 1547, after which some artists moved to Paris or elsewhere.

==First School of Fontainebleau (from 1531)==
In 1531, the Florentine artist Rosso Fiorentino, having lost most of his possessions at the Sack of Rome in 1527, was invited by François I to come to France, where he began an extensive decorative program for the Château de Fontainebleau. In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, Francesco Primaticcio (from Bologna). Rosso killed himself in France in 1540. On the advice of Primaticcio, Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate (from Modena) was invited to France in 1552 by François&#x27;s son Henri II. Although known for their work at Fontainebleau, these artists were also invited to create works of art for other noble families of the period and were much esteemed and well-paid.

The works of this &quot;first school of Fontainebleau&quot; are characterized by the extensive use of stucco (moldings and picture frames) and frescos, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of allegories and mythological iconography. Renaissance decorative motifs such as grotesques, strapwork and putti are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism. The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian Mannerism of Michelangelo, Raphael and especially Parmigianino. Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique Roman statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary. 

Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and dell&#x27;Abate have not survived; parts of the Chateau were remodelled at various dates. The paintings of the group were reproduced in prints, mostly etchings, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris. These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived.

The Mannerist style of the Fontainebleau school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter Jean Cousin the Elder, the sculptors Jean Goujon and Germain Pilon, and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist François Clouet the son of Jean Clouet.

===Printmaking workshop===

Although there is no certain proof, most scholars have agreed that there was a printmaking workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself, reproducing the designs of the artists for their works in the palace, as well as other compositions they produced. The most productive printmakers were Léon Davent, Antonio Fantuzzi, and Jean Mignon, followed by the &quot;mysterious&quot; artist known from his monogram as &quot;Master I♀V&quot; (♀ being the alchemical symbol for copper, from which the printing plates were made), and the workshop seems to have been active between about 1542 and 1548 at the latest; François I died in March 1547, after which funding for the palace ended, and the school dispersed. These were the first etchings made in France, and not far behind the first Italian uses of the technique, which originated in Germany. The earliest impressions of all the Fontainebleau prints are in brown ink, and their intention seems to have been essentially reproductive.
The intention of the workshop was to disseminate the new style developing at the palace more widely, both to France and to the Italians&#x27; peers back in Italy. Whether the initiative to do this came from the king or another patron, or from the artists alone, is unclear. David Landau believes that Primaticcio was the driving force; he had stepped up to become the director of the work at Fontainebleau after the suicide of Rosso Fiorentino in 1540.

The enterprise seems to have been &quot;just slightly premature&quot; in terms of catching a market. The etched prints were often marked by signs of the workshop&#x27;s inexperience and sometimes incompetence with the technique of etching, and according to Sue Welsh Reed: &quot;Few impressions survive from these plates, and it is questionable whether many were pulled. The plates were often poorly executed and not well printed; they were often scratched or not well polished and did not wipe clean. Some may have been made of metals soft as copper, such as pewter.&quot; A broadening market for prints preferred the &quot;highly finished textures&quot; of Nicolas Beatrizet, and later &quot;proficient but ultimately uninspired&quot; engravers such as René Boyvin and Pierre Milan.

===Notable artists of the first school===
*Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate (c. 1509–1571) (Italian)
*Damiano del Barbiere, Italian stuccoist and sculptor
*Francesco Scibec da Carpi (died c. 1557) Italian furniture maker, who worked on the &quot;boiseries&quot;.
*Léon Davent, French etcher
*Antonio Fantuzzi, Italian painter and etcher
*Rosso Fiorentino (Giovanni Battista di Jacopo de&#x27; Rossi) (1494–1540) (Italian)
*Juste de Juste (c. 1505–1559) Franco-Italian sculptor and etcher
*Luca Penni (c. 1500/1504–1556) (Italian)
*Francesco Primaticcio (c. 1505–1570) (Italian)
*Léonard Thiry, Flemish, painter and etcher

==Second School of Fontainebleau (from 1594)==

From 1584 to 1594, during the Wars of Religion the château of Fontainebleau was abandoned. Upon his accession to the throne, Henri IV undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born Ambroise Dubois (from Antwerp) and the Parisians Toussaint Dubreuil and Martin Fréminet. They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;second school of Fontainebleau&quot;. Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continue in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions. Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian Torquato Tasso and the ancient Greek novelist Heliodorus of Emesa.

Their style continued to have an influence on artists through the first decades of the 17th century, but other artistic currents (Peter Paul Rubens, Caravaggio, the Dutch and Flemish naturalist schools) soon eclipsed them.
===Notable artists of the second school===
*Ambroise Dubois (c. 1542–1614, Flemish born)
*Toussaint Dubreuil (c. 1561–1602)
*Martin Fréminet (1567–1619)
*Philippe Millereau

<doc id="708349" wikidata="Q145022" url="?curid=708349" title="Pascal's pyramid">
<text>In mathematics, Pascal&#x27;s pyramid is a three-dimensional arrangement of the trinomial numbers, which are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion and the trinomial distribution. Pascal&#x27;s pyramid is the three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional Pascal&#x27;s triangle, which contains the binomial numbers and relates to the binomial expansion and the binomial distribution. The binomial and trinomial numbers, coefficients, expansions, and distributions are subsets of the multinomial constructs with the same names.

==Structure of the tetrahedron==
Because the tetrahedron is a three-dimensional object, displaying it on a piece of paper, a computer screen, or other two-dimensional medium is difficult. Assume the tetrahedron is divided into a number of levels, floors, slices, or layers. The top layer (the apex) is labeled &quot;Layer 0&quot;. Other layers can be thought of as overhead views of the tetrahedron with the previous layers removed. The first six layers are as follows:
The layers of the tetrahedron have been deliberately displayed with the point down so that they are not individually confused with Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

==Overview of the tetrahedron==
* There is three-way symmetry of the numbers in each layer.
* The number of terms in the &quot;n&quot;th layer is the (&quot;n&quot;+1)th triangular number: .
* The sum of the values of the numbers in the &quot;n&quot;th layer is 3&quot;n&quot;.
* Each number in any layer is the sum of the three adjacent numbers in the layer above.
* Each number in any layer is a simple whole number ratio of the adjacent numbers in the same layer.
* Each number in any layer is a coefficient of the trinomial distribution and the trinomial expansion. This non-linear arrangement makes it easier to:
** display the trinomial expansion in a coherent way;
** compute the coefficients of the trinomial distribution;
** calculate the numbers of any tetrahedron layer.
* The numbers along the three edges of the &quot;n&quot;th layer are the numbers of the &quot;n&quot;th line of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. And almost all the properties listed above have parallels with Pascal&#x27;s triangle and multinomial coefficients.

==Trinomial expansion connection==
The numbers of the tetrahedron are derived from the trinomial expansion. The &quot;n&quot;th layer is the detached coefficient matrix (no variables or exponents) of a trinomial expression (e. g.: &quot;A + B + C&quot;) raised to the &quot;n&quot;th power. The &quot;n&quot;th power of the trinomial is expanded by repeatedly multiplying the trinomial by itself:
Each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression; and then the coefficients of like terms (same variables and exponents) are added together. Here is the expansion of (&quot;A + B + C&quot;)4:

Writing the expansion in this non-linear way shows the expansion in a more understandable way. It also makes the connection with the tetrahedron obvious−the coefficients here match those of layer 4. All the implicit coefficients, variables, and exponents, which are normally not written, are also shown to illustrate another relationship with the tetrahedron. (Usually, &quot;1&quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot;; &quot;B&quot;1&quot; is &quot;&quot;B&quot;; and &quot;C&quot;0&quot; is &quot;1&quot;; etc.) The exponents of each term sum to the layer number (&quot;n&quot;), or 4, in this case. More significantly, the value of the coefficients of each term can be computed directly from the exponents. The formula is , where &quot;x, y, z&quot; are the exponents of &quot;A, B, C,&quot; respectively, and &quot;!&quot; is the factorial, i. e.: formula_1. The exponent formulas for the 4th layer are:

The exponents of each expansion term can be clearly seen and these formulae simplify to the expansion coefficients and the tetrahedron coefficients of layer 4.

==Trinomial distribution connection==
The numbers of the tetrahedron can also be found in the trinomial distribution. This is a discrete probability distribution used to determine the chance some combination of events occurs given three possible outcomes−the number of ways the events could occur is multiplied by the probabilities that they would occur. The formula for the trinomial distribution is:

where &quot;x, y, z&quot; are the number of times each of the three outcomes does occur; &quot;n&quot; is the number of trials and equals the sum of &quot;x+y+z&quot;; and &quot;P&quot;A, &quot;P&quot;B, &quot;P&quot;C are the probabilities that each of the three events could occur.

For example, in a three-way election, the candidates got these votes: A, 16 %; B, 30 %; C, 54 %. What is the chance that a randomly selected four-person focus group would contain the following voters: 1 for A, 1 for B, 2 for C? The answer is:

The number 12 is the coefficient of this probability and it is number of combinations that can fill this &quot;112&quot; focus group. There are 15 different arrangements of four-person focus groups that can be selected. Expressions for all 15 of these coefficients are:

formula_2

formula_3

formula_4

formula_5

formula_6
The numerator of these fractions (above the line) is the same for all expressions. It is the sample size−a four-person group−and indicates that the coefficients of these arrangements can be found on layer 4 of the tetrahedron. The three numbers of the denominator (below the line) are the number of the focus group members that voted for A, B, C, respectively.

Shorthand is normally used to express combinatorial functions in the following &quot;choose&quot; format (which is read as &quot;4 choose 4, 0, 0&quot;, etc.).

formula_7

formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

formula_11
But the value of these expression is still equal to the coefficients of the 4th layer of the tetrahedron. And they can be generalized to any layer by changing the sample size (&quot;n&quot;).

This notation makes an easy way to express the sum of all the coefficients of layer &quot;n&quot;:
formula_12.

==Addition of coefficients between layers==
The numbers on every layer (&quot;n&quot;) of the tetrahedron are the sum of the three adjacent numbers in the layer (&quot;n&quot;−1) &quot;above&quot; it. This relationship is rather difficult to see without intermingling the layers. Below are &quot;italic&quot; layer 3 numbers interleaved among bold layer 4 numbers:
The relationship is illustrated by the lower, central number 12 of the 4th layer. It is &quot;surrounded&quot; by three numbers of the 3rd layer: 6 to the &quot;north&quot;, 3 to the &quot;southwest&quot;, 3 to the &quot;southeast&quot;. (The numbers along the edge have only two adjacent numbers in the layer &quot;above&quot; and the three corner numbers have only one adjacent number in the layer above, which is why they are always &quot;1&quot;. The missing numbers can be assumed as &quot;0&quot;, so there is no loss of generality.) This relationship between adjacent layers comes about through the two-step trinomial expansion process.

Continuing with this example, in Step 1, each term of (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; + &quot;C&quot;)3 is multiplied by each term of (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; + &quot;C&quot;)1. Only three of these multiplications are of interest in this example:

Then in Step 2, the summation of like terms (same variables and exponents) results in: 12&quot;A&quot;1&quot;B&quot;2&quot;C&quot;1, which is the term of (&quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; + &quot;C&quot;)4; while 12 is the coefficient of the 4th layer of the tetrahedron.

Symbolically, the additive relation can be expressed as:
: formula_13
where C(&quot;x,y,z&quot;) is the coefficient of the term with exponents &quot;x, y, z&quot; and is the layer of the tetrahedron.

This relationship will work only if the trinomial expansion is laid out in the non-linear fashion as it is portrayed in the section on the &quot;trinomial expansion connection&quot;.

==Ratio between coefficients of same layer==
On each layer of the tetrahedron, the numbers are simple whole number ratios of the adjacent numbers. This relationship is illustrated for horizontally adjacent pairs on the 4th layer by the following:

Because the tetrahedron has three-way symmetry, the ratio relation also holds for diagonal pairs in both directions, as well as for the horizontal pairs shown.

The ratios are controlled by the exponents of the corresponding adjacent terms of the trinomial expansion. For example, one ratio in the illustration above is:
 4     12
The corresponding terms of the trinomial expansion are:

The following rules apply to the coefficients of all adjacent pairs of terms of the trinomial expansion:
* The exponent of one of the variables remains unchanged (&quot;B&quot; in this case) and can be ignored.
* For the other two variables, one exponent increases by 1 and one exponent decreases by 1.
** The exponents of &quot;A&quot; are 3 and 2 (the larger being in the left term).
** The exponents of &quot;C&quot; are 0 and 1 (the larger being in the right term).
* The coefficients and larger exponents are related:
** 4 × 3 = 12 × 1
** 4 / 12 = 1 / 3
* These equations yield the ratio: &quot;1:3&quot;.
The rules are the same for all horizontal and diagonal pairs. The variables &quot;A, B, C&quot; will change.

This ratio relationship provides another (somewhat cumbersome) way to calculate tetrahedron coefficients:
:The coefficient of the adjacent term equals the coefficient of the current term multiplied by the current-term exponent of the decreasing variable divided by the adjacent-term exponent of the increasing variable.
The ratio of the adjacent coefficients may be a little clearer when expressed symbolically. Each term can have up to six adjacent terms:

:For &quot;x&quot; = 0: formula_14
:For &quot;y&quot; = 0: &quot;formula_15&quot;
:For &quot;z&quot; = 0: &quot;formula_16&quot;

where C(&quot;x,y,z&quot;) is the coefficient and &quot;x, y, z&quot; are the exponents. In the days before pocket calculators and personal computers, this approach was used as a school-boy short-cut to write out binomial expansions without the tedious algebraic expansions or clumsy factorial computations.

This relationship will work only if the trinomial expansion is laid out in the non-linear fashion as it is portrayed in the section on the &quot;trinomial expansion connection&quot;.

==Relationship with Pascal&#x27;s triangle==
It is well known that the numbers along the three outside edges of the &quot;n&quot;th layer of the tetrahedron are the same numbers as the &quot;n&quot;th line of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. However, the connection is actually much more extensive than just one row of numbers. This relationship is best illustrated by comparing Pascal&#x27;s triangle down to line 4 with layer 4 of the tetrahedron.

Multiplying the numbers of each line of Pascal&#x27;s triangle down to the &quot;n&quot;th line by the numbers of the &quot;n&quot;th line generates the &quot;n&quot;th layer of the tetrahedron. In the following example, the lines of Pascal&#x27;s triangle are in &quot;italic&quot; font and the rows of the tetrahedron are in bold font.

The multipliers (1 4 6 4 1) compose line 4 of Pascal&#x27;s triangle.

This relationship demonstrates the fastest and easiest way to compute the numbers for any layer of the tetrahedron without computing factorials, which quickly become huge numbers. (Extended precision calculators become very slow beyond tetrahedron layer 200.)

If the coefficients of Pascal&#x27;s triangle are labeled C(&quot;i,j&quot;) and the coefficients of the tetrahedron are labeled C(&quot;n,i,j&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the layer of the tetrahedron, &quot;i&quot; is the row, and &quot;j&quot; is the column, then the relation can be expressed symbolically as:
: formula_17
[&quot;i, j, n&quot; are not exponents here, just sequential labeling indexes.]

==Parallels to Pascal&#x27;s triangle and multinomial coefficients==
This table summarizes the properties of the trinomial expansion and the trinomial distribution. It compares them to the binomial and multinomial expansions and distributions:

* A simplex is the simplest linear geometric form that exists in any dimension. Tetrahedra and triangles are examples in 3 and 2 dimensions, respectively.
* The formula for the binomial coefficient is usually expressed as , where &quot;n&quot;−&quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.

==Other properties==

===Exponential construction===
Arbitrary layer &quot;n&quot; can be obtained in a single step using the following formula:

:formula_18

where &quot;b&quot; is the radix and &quot;d&quot; is the number of digits of any of the central multinomial coefficients, that is

:formula_19

then wrapping the digits of its result by &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1), spacing by &quot;d&quot; and removing leading zeros.

This method generalised to arbitrary dimension can be used to obtain slices of any Pascal&#x27;s simplex.

==Usage==
In genetics, it is common to use Pascal&#x27;s pyramid to find out the proportion between different genotypes on the same crossing. This is done by checking the line that is equivalent to the number of phenotypes (genotypes + 1). That line will be the proportion.

<doc id="708351" wikidata="Q2996943" url="?curid=708351" title="Coquille River (Oregon)">
<text>The Coquille River is a stream, about long, in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a mountainous area of of the Southern Oregon Coast Range into the Pacific Ocean. Its watershed is between that of the Coos River to the north and the Rogue River to the south.

==Course==
The river, formed by the confluence of its north and south forks, begins at Myrtle Point. The North Fork Coquille River, about long), rises in northern Coos County and flows southwest. The East Fork Coquille River, about long, rises in eastern Coos County, and flows generally west to join the North Fork.

The South Fork, about long, rises in southern Coos County, north of the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area, and flows generally north. It receives the Middle Fork Coquille River, about long, then joins the North Fork from the south at Myrtle Point. The combined river meanders generally west, past Coquille. It enters the Pacific at Bandon, about north of Cape Blanco. Just before emptying in the Pacific, it is crossed by US Route 101 via a relatively small drawbridge called Bullards Bridge.

===Tributaries===
Named tributaries of the Coquille River from source to mouth are the North Fork and South Fork followed by Grady, Hall, Gray, Fishtrap, Glen Aiken, Pulaski, Rink, Fat Elk, Calloway, and China creeks. Next come Beaver, Iowa, and Hatchet sloughs followed by Alder, Lampa, Lowe, and Bear creeks. Further downstream Offield Creek enters via Randolph Slough. Then come Sevenmile and Fahys creeks followed by Peterson Gulch. Below that are Spring, Simpson, and Ferry creeks.

==Tidal effect==
The Coquille River is a tidal-effect river. During high tides at sea, the water at the mouth of the river acts like a dam, impeding the flow of the stream. More water always flows out into the ocean than enters with the tide; however, logs, sticks, and leaves on the surface can float upriver at certain times of day. There is a time lag between the high tide at sea and the effect pushing upstream. This varies according to the number of miles from the ocean. The tidal-effect is observed as far as Myrtle Point, some upriver. The head of tide is upriver from the mouth at Bandon. But some salt water does enter across the bar. The salt water intrusion was once minor. Today, however, sometimes traces of salinity appear only a few miles below the town of Coquille. This phenomenon affects industry along the river, as mills and other sites need fresh water intakes on the river in order not to rust or damage equipment or affect production processes.

On its main forks, the Coquille is also an alluvial river valley, meaning it was once a drowned river valley—a lake, or perhaps a much wider river, with a sandy bottom. The soil in the valley is very fertile. However, the rise and fall of the water level, and flooding in winter, prevent ordinary types of farming. A lush grass grows in the valley lowlands which can survive either drought or inundation. Tide-gates along the river can bring in water when needed. On this sweeping stand of grass, in summer many cattle find pasture.

Oregon Water Resources Department Watermaster District 19 covers the Coquille River system.

==History==
In its natural state, the Coquille River meandered widely at its mouth. Owing to storms, tides, or other conditions, the river could empty into the sea as far north as a beach now called Whiskey Run, or as far south as a rock formation called Table Rock—an overall distance of several miles. It is said that when early sailing vessels tried to cross the dangerous bar to return to the port at Bandon, the main channel might have moved, or shoaled in, at the very place the ships had crossed safely on the outgoing journey.

Captain Judah Parker, a sea captain, built a jetty of bunches of cedar branches wrapped in burlap, sunken into the mud. Rocks were added. In the late 1890s, the government built jetties to force the channel to stay put. Huge boulders for the South Jetty, at Bandon, came from the blasting of a nearby mound of rock called Tupper Rock. The North Jetty is across the river, and clearly visible from the south jetty.

The Coquille River Lighthouse, commissioned in 1896, guided mariners to find the dangerous bar at the mouth of the Coquille. The lighthouse was built on or near Rackleff Rock, a rocky obstacle in the channel. The rock became part of the bulwark of the North Jetty area. The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1939, following the last of improvements to the river channel.

The pioneer Hamblock and Bullards families had ranches in that region. But eventually their lands became part of the present Bullards Beach State Park. The old lighthouse building still stands. It is now a tourist attraction.

==Literary setting==
In his early science fiction book &quot;The Begum&#x27;s Millions&quot;, Jules Verne depicted a fictional Utopian community named Ville-France being created in 1872 at the Coquille River&#x27;s confluence with the Pacific, slightly south-west of the actual site of Bandon.

<text>Nectarius of Jerusalem, born Nikolaos Pelopidis (, 1602–1676), was the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem from 1661 to 1669.

==Biography==
Patriarch Nectarius was born Nikolaos Pelopidis near Heraklion in Crete in 1602. He was educated by the monks of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, who were operating the Sinaitic Academy in Herakleion at that time, eventually becoming a monk himself in Sinai.

About 1645 he studied at Athens with the Neo-Aristotelian philosopher and scholar Theophilos Corydalleus.

Early in 1661 he was in Constantinople on business connected with his monastery, and on his return to Sinai he was chosen abbot (25-1-1661). However, on his way to Jerusalem to be consecrated, he was informed that he had been chosen Patriarch of the Holy City, and was consecrated on April 9, 1661.

As he was fond of learning and of music, he arranged for the establishment of schools in Constantinople, in Arta and Chios. In addition, he repaired the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and cared for the reconstruction of monastic houses and guest houses for visitors there.

When he was present in Iași, the capital of Moldavia, he became involved with the issues surrounding Patriarch Nikon of Moscow and all the Rus&#x27;. In July 1663, when Pantaleon Ligarid and Archbishop Josef of Astrakhan tried to officially depose Patriarch Nikon from his cathedra, Patriarch Nectarius of Jerusalem protested in 1664 against their intended trial of Patriarch Nikon, because he saw no serious basis for it. He also knew Ligarid well, considering him a rogue.

He is known by his recommendation of the &quot;Confessio Orthodoxa&quot; of Peter Mogilas (1645), which he endorsed in 1662.

As early as 1666 he sought to be relieved of his duties, and by 1669 Dositheos Notaras had become his successor.

He participated in the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672, that refuted the Calvinist confessions of Cyril Lucaris.

After his resignation, Nectarius remained in Jerusalem, except for a short time when he was driven to Mount Sinai by Latin monks who came to Palestine with Roman Catholic crusaders. Later he remained at the Monastery of The Holy Archangels (Andromedos, Joppa) until his death. Saint Raphael Hawaweeny states that Nectarius was &quot;a righteous person in mind and soul&quot; and so chose to retire due to &quot;fierce resistance of the Jerusalemite monks when he declined to persecute the indigenous Orthodox&quot;.

Patriarch Nectarius died on July 14, 1676.

===Writings===
Patriarch Nectarius was versed in the Greek, Arabic, Turkish, and Latin languages.

During his patriarchate, Romish emissaries were very active in endeavoring to persuade the Greek Christians of Palestine, suffering under the yoke of the Turks, to unite with the Church of Rome. Among them a Franciscan, named Peter, was especially active in distributing five tracts in defense of the papal authority. Nectarius&#x27; refutation of these tracts regarding papal supremacy was among the most important of his writings, in a publication entitled: &quot;Κατά τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Παπᾶ&quot;, a firm refutation of the Roman Catholic theses.

He also wrote a work in Greek against the doctrines of Luther and Calvin, which was translated into Latin by Renaudot, who published it, together with Gennadius&#x27; &quot;Homilies on the Eucharist.&quot; In his doctrine of the Eucharist, Nectarius was strictly Orthodox, and a zealous opponent of Cyril Lucaris and the Calvinistic movement.

In addition, Nectarius is said to have written a history of the Egyptian empire down to Sultan Selim. In this Arabic manuscript (which he composed in Greek), he states that he personally witnessed a miracle in the region of Heliopolis, Egypt, similar to the narrative of &quot;The Valley of Dry Bones,&quot; (Ezekiel 37:1-14) in which the prophet sees the dead rise again.

<doc id="708354" wikidata="Q4916155" url="?curid=708354" title="Birdstone">
<text>Birdstone (foaled May 16, 2001, in Kentucky) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the 2004 Belmont Stakes and has become a successful sire.

On August 28, 2020 Birdstone was pensioned from stud duty to Old Friends Retirement Farm in Georgetown, Kentucky where he will be accessible to his fans from all over the world.

== Background ==
Owned and bred by Marylou Whitney of Whitney family racing fame, Birdstone was sired by Grindstone, winner of the 1996 Kentucky Derby, who in turn was sired by Unbridled, who won the 1990 Kentucky Derby. Unbridled was in turn sired by Fappiano, a son of Mr. Prospector, the ancestor of the vast majority of winners of Triple Crown races in recent years (22 out of the 24 races 1998-2005).

Birdstone&#x27;s dam, Dear Birdie, was 2004 Broodmare of the Year, and produced 12 stakes winning foals, including Bird Town (by Cape Town), who won the 2003 Kentucky Oaks.

Bird Town would later go on to produce graded stakes winner Bird Song (by Unbridled&#x27;s Song).

== Racing career ==
As a juvenile, Birdstone won the Champagne Stakes, a leading race for two-year-olds, at Belmont Park in 2003.

Beginning his sophomore season, Birdstone won an allowance and finished fifth in the Lane&#x27;s End Stakes.

He was not a factor in the first two Triple Crown races (finishing eighth in the Kentucky Derby and skipping the Preakness Stakes) and was a 36-1 longshot when he upset the overwhelmingly favored Smarty Jones, taking the lead in the final furlong (201 m) in the fastest Belmont Stakes since the advent of modern electronic timing (2002 was the first year times were kept to hundredths).

Birdstone&#x27;s victory represented the first in the Belmont for trainer Nick Zito, whose horses had finished second in that classic five times. In the winner&#x27;s circle after the Belmont Stakes, his owners apologized to the connections of Smarty Jones for winning, as did jockey Edgar Prado.

The next major race for Birdstone was the Travers Stakes, which he won being the fourth betting choice at 5-1. He was Zito&#x27;s first Travers champion.

== Retirement and stud career ==
Birdstone&#x27;s retirement from racing after suffering a bone chip at the Breeders&#x27; Cup was announced on November 4, 2004. He began his career as a stallion at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.

His first starter was the colt Shoe Strap (Birdstone - Boot Strap by Storm Boot), who first went to post on May 21, 2008, at Churchill Downs and was trained by D. Wayne Lukas.

From his first crop of foals to race, Birdstone sired Mine That Bird, who had several wins as a two-year-old gelding before winning the 2009 Kentucky Derby as a three-year-old. Another of Birdstone&#x27;s top runners was Summer Bird, who upset Mine That Bird in the 2009 Belmont Stakes (later winning the Jockey Club Gold Cup). His first crop also included Birdrun, who set the Belmont track record at a mile and a sixteenth .

Birdstone was one of the top ten ranked freshman sires of 2008 with 11 winners out of 22 starters and stood for $10,000 for the remainder of the 2009 season, despite his first-crop success. His 2010 stud fee was posted as $30,000 but by 2017 it had fallen to $5,000. Birdstone has sired 31 black-type runners, 20 stakes winners, 8 graded stakes winners, and has amassed progeny earnings over $21 million.

Birdstone&#x27;s most notable progeny includes:
* Summer Bird: Won Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup, 2009 Eclipse Champion 3 Year Old Colt.
* Mine That Bird: Won Kentucky Derby, Grey Stakes, 2008 Canadian Champion Juvenile Male. 
* Noble Bird: Won Stephen Foster Handicap, Pimlico Special, Fayette Stakes.
* Birdrun: Won Brooklyn Handicap. 
* Blue Tone: Won San Gabriel Stakes. 
* Thank You Marylou: Won Dogwood Stakes, multiple graded stakes placed. Breeders&#x27; Cup placed. 
* Florida Won: Won Ontario Derby and Seagram Cup Stakes. 
* Swipe: Won Juvenile Championship Stakes, multiple graded stakes placed. Breeders&#x27; Cup Placed.
Birdstone was pensioned from stud duties after the 2020 breeding season and was moved to Old Friends to live out the rest of his days.

<doc id="708355" wikidata="Q2601964" url="?curid=708355" title="Cape Blanco (Oregon)">
<text>Cape Blanco is a prominent headland on the Pacific Ocean coast of southwestern Oregon in the United States, forming the westernmost point in the state. Cape Blanco extends farther west than any point of land in the contiguous United States (lower 48 states) except portions of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, including Cape Alava, the true westernmost point. The cape is part of Cape Blanco State Park and is the location of the Cape Blanco Light, first lit in 1870.

The cape may have been named by explorer Martín de Aguilar in 1603 for its appearance, as &quot;blanco&quot; means &quot;white&quot; in Spanish. In 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra named the point Cabo Diligensias. It was later renamed Cape Orford by Captain George Vancouver in 1792, but this name fell into disuse and Cape Blanco became the common usage.

==Geology==
The cape, a relatively level landform with cliffs facing the sea, is about higher than the ocean. It consists of layers of uplifted marine sediments, ranging in age from 80 million years at the bottom to less than 500,000 years at the top. The uplift is continuing; Cape Blanco is rising by several millimeters each year. Generally, landforms on the north and south end of the Oregon Coast are rising as the ocean floor slides under the continent, while the central part of the coast &quot;seems to be folding down.&quot;

Landforms near the cape include beaches, bluffs, and reefs. Visible to the south are Needle Rock, Blanco Reef, and Humbug Mountain. To the north are Gull Rock, Castle Rock, and Blacklock Point. Blanco Reef is a group of irregular rocks and ledges that are from offshore and are up to high.

==Geography and climate==
Cape Blanco is in northern Curry County, about north of Port Orford, along a mountainous and isolated stretch of the coast bounded to the east by the Coast Range. It lies about west of U.S. Route 101.

The Sixes River empties into the Pacific Ocean along the north side of the cape. A walk along the Oregon Coast Trail leads south from the park to the mouth of the Elk River.

Cape Blanco has very mild temperatures year round, with an all-time record high of only . Annual precipitation is high, but there is a distinct drying trend in summer, which gives Cape Blanco a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) according to the Köppen climate classification system. During winter storms, wind speeds can reach at the cape. Extreme winds at the cape and over the Blanco Reef make this part of the coast especially dangerous for ships.

==Recreation==
Activities at the park include hiking, horseback riding, fishing, camping, picnicking, and beachcombing, among others, and visiting the lighthouse, a pioneer cemetery, or the Hughes House, on the National Register of Historic Places.

The property belonged originally to Patrick Hughes, who came to the cape in 1860 in search of gold and who eventually established a dairy ranch along the lower Sixes River. Restored by the Friends of Cape Blanco, the two-story, eleven-room ranch house was completed in 1898.

==Literature==
In Jules Verne&#x27;s early science fiction book &quot;The Begum&#x27;s Millions&quot;, a utopian community named Ville-France is established in 1872 on the South Oregon beach. Verne gives the location of this fictitious community as &quot;eighty kilometers north of Cape Blanco&quot;. Cape Blanco is also noted on a map of Brobdingnag in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, as well as mentioned in Chapter 3 of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;: &quot;And that harpoon-so like a corkscrew now-was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.&quot;

<text>The Coos River flows for about into Coos Bay along the Pacific coast of southwest Oregon in the United States. Formed by the confluence of its major tributaries, the South Fork Coos River and the Millicoma River, it drains an important timber-producing region of the Southern Oregon Coast Range. The course of the main stem and the major tributaries is generally westward from the coastal forests to the eastern end of Coos Bay near the city of Coos Bay.

The river is the largest tributary of Coos Bay, which at about is the largest estuary that lies entirely within Oregon. The river enters the bay about from where the bay—curving east, north, and west of the cities of Coos Bay and North Bend and passing by the communities of Barview and Charleston—meets the ocean. About 30 other tributaries also enter the bay directly.

Most of the Coos River watershed of is in Coos County, but are in eastern Douglas County. Commercial forests cover about 85 percent of the basin.

The river supports populations of chinook and coho salmon, Pacific lamprey, western brook lamprey, shad, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Since public river-bank access is limited, fishing is often done by boat.

==Course==
Flowing west from the confluence of the South Fork Coos River and the Millicoma River, the Coos River is bordered by Oregon Route 241 (Coos River Highway) on the and Coos River Road on the . Downstream from its source, the river receives Noah Creek from the right from the river mouth. Curving south, the river receives Vogel Creek and then Lillian Creek, both from the left, before passing under Chandler Bridge, which carries Route 241 from the right bank to the left bank about from the mouth. The river then turns west and north as it enters the bay and splits into two distributaries separated by a marsh. The Cooston Channel, which is on the right, continues north around the west side of the marsh for about to the mouth. The left-hand channel almost immediately merges with Catching Slough, which enters from the left and continues around the east side of the marsh to meet the Marshfield Channel of the bay.

===Discharge===
Estimates of the average discharge of the Coos River varies from in late summer to in February. Estimated extremes vary from a low of to a high of .

<text>Coos Bay (Coos language: Atsixiis or Hanisich) is an estuary where the Coos River enters the Pacific Ocean, the estuary is approximately 12 miles long and up to two miles wide. It is the largest estuary completely within Oregon state lines. The Coos Bay watershed covers an area of about 600 square miles and is located in northern Coos County, Oregon, in the United States. The Coos River, which begins in the Oregon Coast Range, enters the bay from the east. From Coos River, the bay forms a sharp loop northward before arching back to the south and out to the Pacific Ocean. Haynes Inlet enters the top of this loop. South Slough branches off from the bay directly before its entrance into the Pacific Ocean. The bay was formed when sea levels rose over 20,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, flooding the mouth of the Coos River. Coos Bay is Oregon&#x27;s most important coastal industrial center and international shipping port, with close ties to San Francisco, the Columbia River, Puget Sound and other major ports of the Pacific rim.

The city of Coos Bay is located on the peninsula formed by the inside of the loop of the bay. Charleston is located near the entrance to South Slough. Many of the commercial fishing and recreational fishing boats that call Coos Bay home are docked in Charleston. North Bend, located at the apex of the peninsula, is home to the Southwest Oregon Regional Airport.

The estuary has been altered over 150 years of modern anthropogenic use. Dredging, deepening, river diversion and spoil disposal has led to physical, biological, and chemical changes to the system over time.

== Geology ==

The bedrock of the greater Coos Bay region was formed from the Mesozoic through the Pliocene eras out of volcanic rock, sedimentary rock, and igneous rock intrusions. The area&#x27;s geologic history is highlighted by tectonic interaction between oceanic and continental plates. Subduction and abduction of the oceanic plate with the North American Plate has led to a thicker crust in Southwestern Oregon. The Empire Formation, on which Coos Bay lies, is mainly composed of sedimentary rock created by marine sediments that were deposited offshore before being pushed onshore over millions of years. This process results in the oldest rock being furthest east. East of the bay, and in the Coos River watershed, the bedrock is the oldest, formed during the Eocene. The center of Coos Bay, where the towns of North Bend and Coos Bay sit, was formed during the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The North Spit, the most western area bordering the ocean, is composed of sand dunes. These formed much more recently as sand was deposited along the coast after eroding from other areas. By studying the transition from peaty to muddy intertidal sediment and the associated microfossils in the estuary, researchers were able to determine 10 instances of sudden rises in sea level as a potential proxy for earthquakes, including two dating 1,700 and 2,300 years ago when sea level rose by at least half a meter. This same study also found evidence of a large earthquake 300 years ago along the great plate boundary. In addition, sea level rise 20,000 years ago drowned the prior river mouth, creating Coos Bay estuary as we know today.

== Physical geography ==

=== Tidal flats ===
Tidal flats are areas where sediments that are deposited from rivers and tides accumulate. Coos Bay is primarily made up of mud and sand flats that form in areas of low tidal activity. The estuary covers 10,973 acres at mean high water and 5,810 acres at mean low water, and about 48% of the watershed is tideland. Tidal effects can extend up the tributaries 27 miles from the ocean. Of the tidal flats in Coos Bay estuary, organic content is highest in the mudflats (8-18% of dry weight, 19.77 ppt) compared to the sandflats (1-2% of dry weight, &lt;0.1 ppt). These areas tend to lack visible vegetation, but do support benthic diatoms, mats of green and yellow green algae, and eelgrass beds (Zostera marina and Z. japonica). Tidal flats in the estuary have a network of shallow channels that allow water to drain when the flats are above water, and when submerged, allow water and sediment to pass through the flats. In this way, the flats act as a barrier that slows the water passing through, reduces how much water can flow through, and encourages the deposition, re-suspension, and transport of particles with the tides as the flats are constantly experiencing deposition and erosion.

The mudflats are primarily made of a mix of medium and fine-grained sands, silts, and clays, while the sandflats are primarily made of medium-sized sand grains derived from the erosion of the nearby cliffs. The higher organic content of mudflats is composed of plant and animal tissues and wastes, diatoms, bacteria, and flocculants, chemicals that pull suspended particles out of the water to form into sediment. The environment a few centimeters below the sediment doesn&#x27;t have enough oxygen, so sulfate-reducing bacteria live there, breaking down organic matter and producing hydrogen sulfide, giving the mudflats the classic &quot;rotten egg&quot; smell.

=== Weather ===
The mild marine climate of Coos Bay is classified as Csb or a Temperate Mediterranean Climate zone and is heavily influenced by the Pacific Ocean and precipitation from the Coast Range. Regional weather consists of a cool, wet season in the winter (November through March) with an average annual rainfall of 56 inches, and a mild, dry season in the summer (May through September) with an average rainfall of less than 4 inches. Runoff follows this same pattern, with approximately one month of lag. Air temperatures range from 40° to 75 °F. Winter storms lead to accumulation of winter precipitation and which is a significant input of fresh water and sediments.

=== Fluvial geomorphology ===
Fluvial geomorphology is the study of the way rivers move through and affect their surrounding landscape. For an estuary, this involves the tributaries and their flow rates, bottom topography, water discharge and the drainage basin, and sedimentation and deposition.

==== Tributaries ====
Thirty tributaries enter the bay, including 13 freshwater sources, the Coos River being the largest freshwater source. About 1 m3/s of freshwater is released by the Coos River into the estuary in the summer and &gt;300 m3/s in the winter. These waters travel through areas of heavy logging and limited agriculture, originating from the Coastal Range. The main channel of the estuary follows the north–south trending anticline (an arch-like fold in the ground), ending in the Isthmus Slough, Catching Slough, Haynes Inlet, and Coos River; while southward, the South Slough follows the syncline (an inward curve in the ground). The sediment accumulation rate is approximately 2.3–9 mm/yr in a 0.9-m deep flat in South Slough over a 300-year timescale. This is greater than the sea level is expected to rise locally, 1.10 ± 0.73 mm/yr.
==== Bottom topography ====
Coos Bay is considered a drowned river valley estuary, meaning it was a river valley that was flooded as sea levels rose. The shallow and narrow V-shaped topography of Coos Bay is more varied across the channel than it is longitudinally. It is deepest near the mouth of the estuary, where the bottom is uniform, and the slope leading to this decline is gentle. This topography, coupled with high tidal range and low runoff, allows for lateral and vertical mixing.

==== Water discharge and drainage basin ====
Annually, Coos Bay is estimated to discharge 2.2 million acre-feet of fresh water, with a yearly maximum of 3,044,000 ac-ft and a minimum of 1,560,000 ac-ft, based on extrapolations of fresh water inflow measured at the West Fork of the Millicoma River mouth in 1974. According to a US Department of Commerce survey from 1954 to 1970, freshwater inflow enters the estuary at a rate of 90 cubic feet per second (cfs) in the summer and 5500 cfs in the winter with an average of 2200 cfs. The drainage basin consists of forest, cropland, and rangelands. The South Slough watershed alone has a drainage area of about 7,932 ha.
==== Sedimentation and deposition ====
As of 1975, the Coos Bay has experienced a greater influx of sediment than output. Such sediment includes silt from drainage basin erosion, and various sands (marine sand, dune sand, South Slough cliff sand) due to erosion in the surrounding areas. Sediments are formed and moved via streams, littoral drift, or transport of sediments along a coastline parallel to the shore, processes due to wind activity, and erosion. Sediment grains increase in size with depth and decrease in size when moving further into the estuary, likely because tidal currents are less strong further in and can no longer carry larger particles. To keep the estuary fit as a navigation channel, an average of 1.65 million square yards of material was removed annually by the US Army Corps of Engineers prior to the start of the Deep-Draft Navigation Project. Sediments input averages 72,000 tons annually.

Modeling of Coos Bay sediment movement compared to historical patterns reveals that suspended-sediment concentrations and sediment retention has increased in the estuary over time as dredging, river diversion, construction and spoils disposal continues. As a result of this development, sediment transport has been diverted into the central navigation channel, where more sediment is accumulating. Tidal flat sediment retention has also increased.

== Biogeochemistry ==

=== Tides and upwelling ===
Seasonal winds cause tides and upwelling that influence nutrients and the biogeochemistry of Coos Bay estuary. One third of macrophyte production in the estuary is attributed to upwelling. In the summer, wind primarily comes from the North along the Oregon coast, bringing up nutrient-rich deep water and boosting primary production. Strong tides then move these upwelled nutrients further upstream, which stimulates primary production in the estuary. Oregon experiences mixed semi-diurnal tides, meaning there are two high and two low tides per day which differ in height. In 2000, the difference in semi-diurnal high and low tides was on average 0.3-0.5 m, and the average tidal amplitude between Mean Higher High Water and Mean Lower Low Water was about 2.1 m. The tidal prism, or the amount of water between mean high tide and mean low tide, accounts for 30% of the estuary&#x27;s volume. Estuary mixing and stratification is dependent on the tidal flux and river flux. Circulation patterns are also tidally-influenced. In the summer, the estuary is well-mixed, but in the winter it is highly stratified. Furthermore, in the summer months saltwater influence is greater as freshwater flow into the estuary is minimal. Following anthropogenic deepening and widening, the estuary has a 33% greater mean tidal amplitude and 18% more salinity intrusion length.

=== Nutrients ===
Nitrogen inputs vary seasonally and along the salinity gradient. Increased precipitation during the wet season is a major input of land-based nitrogen, as is the watershed associated with agricultural nitrogen runoff and red alder nitrogen fixation. Oregon Coast Range streams typically contain higher amounts of nitrate compared to other Pacific Northwest streams due to the healthy population of red alder trees capable of fixing nitrogen. During the dry season, the major input of nitrogen comes from the ocean following upwelling events bringing nutrients like nitrogen into the estuary. In the late summer and fall, nitrate concentrations measured at low tide are varied, with highest concentrations in the tidal regions of the estuary, and lowest at the riverine ends. In the winter, during peak freshwater inputs, nitrate concentrations are high and fairly uniform throughout the estuary. This indicates that in the dry season, nutrient sources come from the Ocean, while in the wet season, nutrients are coming in with the freshwater. During summer months when dry conditions persist and upwelling is occurring, the primary source of phosphorus is from the ocean. Thus, phosphorus concentrations also vary depending on location in the estuary, on the ocean end or riverine end.

=== Chemistry ===
Roughly half of the total organic matter within the Coos Bay estuary is stored organic carbon within sediments. Clay and silt particles typically have the highest concentrations of organic matter associated with them. Photosynthesis by primary producers draws down atmospheric carbon dioxide and eventual burial of primary producers such as eelgrass and algae lead to long term burial of carbon in estuarine sediments. Estuaries can provide an important sink for increasing global carbon dioxide concentrations as estuary sediments can store carbon rapidly depending on tidal fluxes.

Similar to nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll is dependent on upwelling and tidal mixing and varies along the salinity gradient. These physical processes influence estuarine chlorophyll by either directly transporting chlorophyll associated with plants from coastal waters into the estuary or by transporting recently upwelled, nutrient rich water, into the estuary which triggers primary production.

Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels vary according to wind forcing, river discharge and tides, with a variety of timescales from daily (tidal) to yearly. These values &quot;[ambiguous]&quot; and pH are also monitored at various locations throughout South Slough. In the wet winter season (December - February), the bottom water measured in the tidal waters of South Slough at Valino Island tends to be relatively cold, with temperatures ranging from 5° to 11 °C and highly variable salinity (0-20 psu). In the spring (March–May), temperatures increase to 13° to 23 °C and salinity becomes more stabilized (27 ± 4 psu) due to is less freshwater input. During the dry summer season (June - August), bottom temperatures increase to around 15 °C and salinity increases with less variability (31 ± 3 psu). In the fall (September - November) temperatures drop and salinity becomes more variable (30 ± 5 psu). Similar patterns are expected throughout the estuary, although location within the estuary will alter dynamics and values.

Seasonal variations of dissolved oxygen include relative highs in the fall and winter (Dec - Jan; &gt;8 mg L−1) with fluctuations across the estuary and lows in the spring and summer during the upwelling season (Apr - Sep; close to 5 mg L−1), with some variation. Lowest dissolved oxygen levels are found in the mouth in the spring and at the riverine end in late summer and early fall. While upwelling does bring oxygen-poor water to the surface, upwelling strength alone is not a good predictor of low dissolved oxygen levels; the influence of other physical and biological factors are also needed to explain patterns of oxygen concentration. Overall, there is minimal likelihood of hypoxia due to rapid tidal exchange and shallow waters, based on the established dissolved oxygen content of the estuary throughout the year.

South Slough did not exhibit any distinct seasonal pattern in pH at any of the monitoring sites, instead remaining within 7.5 and 8.2 year round at Valino Island. pH tends to be lower in the more riverine locations, between 6.5 and 7.8. However, there were strong daily fluctuations in pH following the tides and daylight at all monitoring sites, as shown by strong correlation with conductivity and salinity.

Generally, levels of nutrients, salinity, specific conductivity and chlorophyll are at healthy levels in the estuary, as are water temperature, oxygen, and pH.

=== Pollution ===
Historically, Coos Bay has been subject to a range of pollutants from different sources from logging mills, boat manufacturing, and runoff. The area is also particularly vulnerable to any oil or chemical spills at the International Port of Coos Bay, due to its strong tidal currents. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) began collecting samples of pollutions and contaminants in the late 1990s, and found that one of the largest sources of pollution into the Coos Bay estuary had been from tributyltin (TBT) sourced from two active shipyards within the estuary. TBT became an environmental concern in the late 1980s after commercial oyster farmers began noticing shell deformities. After sample results showed toxic levels of TBT, the two shipyards worked with the DEQ to clean up contaminated sediments and implement more environmentally conscience practices, which allowed Coos Bay to avoid being listed as a superfund site. Southeast of Coos Bay is one of the state&#x27;s largest coal fields with an area of 250 sq miles. Groundwater seepage from this coal field historically has also been a source of pollution.

== Ecology and biology ==

=== Plant life ===
Plant life in Coos Bay supports biodiverse ecosystems contained within this watershed, ranging from forests in the uplands to eelgrass meadows in the bay. The forested regions of Coos Bay have been logged at least once in the past century, and some of these areas were replanted solely with Douglas fir trees. Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Port Orford cedar trees can also be found in Coos Bay watershed, ranging from 15- to 75-years of age. Key upland area plant life also include evergreen huckleberry, Pacific sword fern, salal and salmonberry. Fresh and tidal marsh plants include baltic rush, fleshy jaumea, Lyngby&#x27;s sedge, Pacific silverweed, pickleweed, salt grass, seaside arrowgrass, skunk cabbage, Slough sedge, salt-marsh bird&#x27;s beak, western bog lily, and tufted hairgrass.

==== Eelgrass ====

In the aquatic regions, eelgrass (&quot;Zostera marina&quot; and &quot;Zostera japonica&quot;) covers about 1,400 acres of Coos Bay. Eelgrass beds are a vital habitat to many species of invertebrates. Additionally, the eelgrass affects the flow of water through the area, stabilizes the sediment, exchanges nutrients between the water column and sediments, and is a source of food for consumers. The beds provide cover for predators and prey alike, including ecologically or economically important fish (see Fish section below).

Eelgrasses are clearly important to the ecosystem, but they are also vulnerable to disruption. During a study in 1996, the density of eelgrass (&quot;Zostera marina&quot;) plants decreased by 59.4% over a period of 75 days on plots undergoing mariculture of Pacific oysters compared to only a 28.8% reduction in the control plots. The &quot;Z. marina&quot; also decreased in spatial cover under treatment conditions, by 70.7% in high elevations and 36.7% in lower intertidal regions of the study. Following removal of these mariculture practices, &quot;Z. marina&quot; beds struggled to recover, and recovery depended most on how many &quot;Z. marina&quot; plants there were at the start of recovery, rather than on new growth. However, transplanted &quot;Z. marina&quot; did recover better than plots left to recover on their own. Aside from anthropogenic influences, eelgrass is also affected by other factors. A study on &quot;Z. marina&quot; meadows in Coos Bay from 1998 to 2001 found that &quot;Z. marina&quot; is more dense in areas with higher salinity and lower temperature; gradients which vary within the estuary depending on location. Over the course of the study, which includes the transition from El Niño to La Niña, leading to warmer winters and cooler summers, eelgrass density, biomass, and flowering all increased.

Japanese eelgrass (&quot;Zostera japonica&quot;) is an invasive species, likely introduced during commercial oyster cultivation in 1970 or earlier. The distribution of &quot;Z. japonica&quot; has spread from the upper reaches of South Slough in the 1970s into the middle region of the estuary by 1987. By the early 1980s it is everywhere in the estuary, most commonly in the mid intertidal zone. &quot;Z. japonica&quot; converts unvegetated mudflats into eelgrass beds, leading to significant changes in the species composition and abundance of invertebrate communities of the area. Overall, species richness was significantly higher in &quot;Z. japonica&quot; dominated areas than it was before the invasion.

=== Algae ===
A variety of algae can be found in Coos Bay. Micro-algae or Phytoplankton, such as diatoms, are abundant. Coos Bay has some of the highest primary productivity within west coast estuaries. In the lower part of the bay, species such as &quot;Chaetoceros&quot;, &quot;Skeletonema&quot;, and &quot;Thalassiosira&quot; are found. In the upper part of the bay, species such as &quot;Melosira&quot; and &quot;Skeletonema&quot; are found. As of 1973, zooplankton were most abundant near the ocean, and numbers tended to decrease further into the bay. Neritic (swimming) species were found in the lower parts of the estuary. In a typical year, there is a small bloom of diatoms in the late winter and early spring before heavy grazing pressure by the zooplankton limits overall abundance. Lack of sunlight limits diatom growth in the fall and winter. Most algae are found at the mouth of the bay, and notably there is a shift in species from marine to brackish water plants here. Kelp beds, specifically those of bull kelp (&quot;Nereocystis leutkeana&quot;), are found in the bay as well.

=== Fish ===
Coos Bay provides habitat for both residential and anadromous fish. The South Slough is an essential nursery environment for many marine fish in their larval and juvenile life stages. Near the mouth of the bay, perch, sculpin, and rockfish are found. Surveys in the South Slough, the most commonly studied portion of Coos Bay, have shown that Shiner perch are the most abundant fish in the estuary. Shiner perch comprise 76% of fish caught by seine, and typically have a strong association with the eelgrass beds. Staghorn sculpin are another dominant species. Many of the residential species, Shiner perch included, move into the tidal flats during flood tides. Overall, the fish biomass abundance decreases with increasing distance from the ocean. Coho salmon, Chinook salmon, Steelhead, Coastal cutthroat trout, Striped bass, Pacific lampreys, Western brook lampreys and American shad all migrate through Coos Bay during different times of the year. The Coos Bay estuary provides critical habitat for many of the juveniles of these species that have migrated upriver to spawn. Historically, White sturgeon, Green sturgeon, and Chum Salmon could also be found in Coos Bay.

=== Shellfish ===
Some of Oregon&#x27;s most productive shellfishing is in Coos Bay. Coos Bay is Oregon&#x27;s largest bay, and the lower part of the bay offers many shellfishing opportunities such as crabbing and clamming. The lower bay is the area that extends from the airport to the ocean entrance, and is marine dominated (meaning there is little freshwater influence). Some popular, easily accessible clamming spots are along Cape Arago highway, where recreational clammers can dig for gaper and butter clams, in the extensive mud flats during low tide. Gaper, Cockle, Butter, Littleneck, Razor and Softshell Clams have all been found in the bay. Various species of clams were commercially harvested up to 1985. Dungeness crab are also frequently caught by recreational fishermen inside the bay. Ghost and mud shrimp are also found in the tidal flats and are harvested by both recreational and commercial fishermen for use as bait.

In the South Slough, Polychaetes (e.g. annelid worms) comprise 38% of the genera found, making them the most diverse in the ecosystem. In contrast, Decapods (e.g. crabs) comprise only 16%, and Bivalves (e.g. clams) only 13%. Generally, species composition decreases with increasing distance from the ocean.
=== Wildlife ===
Mallard Ducks, Pintail Ducks, Widgeon, Marbled murrelet, and Coot all live in the estuaries. The more migratory species of Canvasback ducks, Pintail ducks, and Black Brant winter in the estuaries. Many of the seabirds typically found along Oregon&#x27;s coast such as pelicans and gulls can also be seen in the bay. Seals and sea lions can typically be seen in the marine dominated zones. River otters can be found further up in the estuary. The fresh and tidal marshes are home to American beavers. Roosevelt elk live in the uplands.

=== Tidal marshes ===
Tidal marshes are marshes that are found along the coast and experience regular tidal flooding and draining. They are important because they provide protection against storm surges, reduce erosion, improve water quality, support a biodiverse ecosystem, and provide opportunities for recreation, which boosts the local economy. The resilience of a tidal marsh depends on the vegetation types and their location in the tidal frame, exposure to stressors, surrounding land use, and if there is enough space for migration. The soils of tidal marshes tend to be salty and hypoxic, with vegetation adapted for regular precipitation and tidal flooding. These areas are especially vulnerable to changes in these systems, especially rising sea levels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System work together to assess the resilience of tidal marshes around the country and provide recommendations for their management and conservation. Coos Bay is composed of several types of tidal marshes, according to reports from 1974, 1979, and 2021:

The low sand marsh is mainly sandy, but may have silt and mud. This marsh type gently slopes at the edges into the surrounding area. Commonly found plants include Pickleweed, Seaside arrowgrass, Desert saltgrass, Three-Square rush, &quot;Jaumea&quot;, Dwarf hairgrass, Sea plantain, Paintbrush orthocarpus, &quot;Glaux maritima&quot;, &quot;Carex lyngbyei&quot;, and Tufted hairgrass. The low silt marsh is generally silty and muddy and is lacking in channels for tidal drainage. Commonly found plants include &quot;Triglochin maritirh, Scirpus robustus, Carex, Jaumea, Spergularia, Juncus lescurii,&quot; and &quot;Cotula coronopifolia.&quot; The sedge marsh is composed of low and high marshes which are likely to have diffuse tidal drainage and channels up to four feet high, respectively. Commonly found plants include &quot;Carex lynghyei, Triglochin, Deschampsia caespitosa,&quot; and &quot;Hordeum nodosum&quot;. The immature high marsh is easily identified as it is flat and sits a few feet above the surrounding mudflats. The immature high marsh also has deep channels that drain it. Commonly found plants include &quot;Carex, Deschampsia, Hordeum, Juncus lesccurii, Potentilla pacifica, Distichlis, Artiplex natula,&quot; and &quot;Agrostis alba&quot;. The mature high marsh is typically higher than the immature high marsh and it contains underground drainage channels. Commonly found plants include &quot;Remex occidentalis, Grindelia stricta, Trifolium wormskjoldii, Vicia gigantea,&quot; and &quot;Lathyrus japonicus&quot;. The bulrush-sedge marsh is typically found on the banks of a river or slough, particularly one with freshwater. Commonly plants include &quot;Scirpus validus&quot; and &quot;Carex lyngbyei&quot;. The diked marsh has broad variability as this is not a &quot;natural&quot; type of marsh. Instead, it is formed when saltwater is cut off from entering the former marsh. Most marshes found in Coos Bay were likely high or immature high marshes, before they were diked and used for pasture land. Saltwater plants, over time, will be replaced by freshwater plants. One saltwater plant that may remain is &quot;Juncus lescurii&quot;. The replacement plants, however, include grasses, shrubs, buttercups, herbs, alders, and other trees. The surge plain is the result of overflowing streams that were dammed, therefore also has broad variability.
=== South Slough ===
The South Slough, a sub-basin of the Coos watershed, is particularly well studied. The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, spanning 4,771 acres, was the first estuary protected by the National Estuarine Research Reserve in 1974. Since then, the estuary and surrounding watershed have been constantly monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Oregon Department of State Lands. Monitoring includes both water quality, ecosystem surveys, and measurements of resilience. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System rated South Slough as more vulnerable than the national average because its tidal range is small and most of the vegetation is below the mean tide. Additionally, most of the edges of the marsh are un-vegetated. However, South Slough was rated higher than average for adaptive capacity because there is a lot of space for marsh migration as sea levels rise; recommendations for management include protecting these surrounding areas.

The diverse ecosystems that encompass the South Slough Reserve include salt marshes, eelgrass beds, sand, mud, and tidal flats, freshwater ponds and marshes, and even benthic habitats in the deep open channels.

=== Threats ===
Threats to the biodiversity of Coos Bay watershed include invasive species, forest pathogens, and wildfire. Green crabs, a species native to Europe, are invasive in Coos Bay. One of the species of eelgrass, &quot;Zostera japonica&quot;, is also invasive. Through 2015, seagrass saw an increase in abundance, but Oregon State researchers have suggested that there has been a recent precipitous decline in seagrass mean density in parts of South Slough after a peak in 2015. Additionally, boats and ships have accidentally introduced terrestrial plant species such as gorse, English ivy, reed canary grass, and &quot;Spartina spp&quot;. The South Slough Research Reserve is aware of these species and, according to its 2017-2022 Management Plan, is &quot;motivated to minimize their damaging effects early.&quot; Douglas fir trees may experience swiss needle cast as a result of contracting the fungal infection &quot;Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii&quot;. This results in stunted growth. Port Orford cedars and sometimes Pacific yews contract root rot from &quot;Phytophthora lateralis&quot;. This rot moves up the tree and kills the inner bark, thereby leading to the death of the tree. Furthermore, wildfire risk continues to increase as global climate change leads to hotter and drier conditions.

== Historical usage ==

=== Native Americans ===

The estuary is land of the Coos and the Coquille––specifically the Miluk people––who have lived in the area for approximately 6,000 years. The flora and fauna of the watershed provided significant amounts of food and material for hunting and shelter. Villages generally homed around 100 people. Shortly after European settlers arrived in the 1850s, the Natives were forcibly removed and forbidden to return to their land. In the 1870s, &quot;eligible&quot; Natives were allotted a plot of land on which they could rebuild homes. This program was deeply ingrained within colonization, and therefore promoted assimilation in the Euro-American culture. Today, the Coos peoples are a part of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians.
=== Deep-Draft Navigation Project ===
The estuary has a long history of dredging, deepening, and spoil disposal, dating back to early development in the mid-1800s. In 1976, the Coos Bay was dredged as part of the Deep-Draft Navigation Project, a campaign by the US Army Corps of Engineers to increase channel depth and width for vessel usage. In its natural state, the estuary&#x27;s entrance was approximately 200 feet wide and 10 feet deep; this project altered the entrance to measure 700 feet wide and 45 feet deep. Total estuary volume has increased 21% while the total estuary areas has decreased by 12%. In contrast, 25 km2 of the estuary in South Slough has been managed by the National Estuarine Research Reserve and left unaltered by development. A harbor and bridge were constructed in the entrance of South Slough, and the entry point of Coos River into the estuary has been redirected to the west, partially separating it from the east-estuary flats. As a result of this, modeling reveals, the estuary has overall become more stratified and accumulates more sediment than it did historically. Further deepening of the navigation channel from 11 to 14 m and widening by about 45 m has already been proposed for the western reach. The navigational channel of Coos Estuary is regularly dredged to this day to allow for commercial shipping.

=== Present ===
Currently, the greater Coos County––which encompasses the watershed––is home to over 64,000 people. A 2014 community report ranked the area poorly in climate adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, and resource efficiency, along with a few social and community aspects.

== Economy ==

=== Fisheries and aquaculture ===
Coos Bay hosts several oyster aquaculture operations. Clausen&#x27;s Oysters is located in Haynes Inlet at the north end of the estuary. Qualman Oyster Farms is located near the entrance to South Slough. Additionally, clams are harvested recreationally. Charleston acts as a port for many commercial vessels that fish off of Oregon&#x27;s coast. Similar to other ports in Oregon, these fisheries include Dungeness crab, Pink shrimp, Pacific whiting, Chinook salmon, Albacore tuna, and Pacific halibut. The prominence of these industries promotes good water quality maintenance.

=== Shipping port ===
The Port of Coos Bay is one of the largest and deepest ports between San Francisco, California and the Columbia River. The majority of cargo is offloaded in the southeast corner of Coos Bay, which is near the head of the inlet, opposite the Coos River entrance. Currently, 2 million tons of cargo move through the port. There are plans to widen the channel from 300 ft to 450 ft and to deepen it from 37 ft to 45 ft, allowing the shipping operations to scale up. Coupled with the Coos Bay Rail Line, which threads through the Oregon Coast Range to Eugene, the port could see increased usage in coming years.

=== Natural gas ===
Jordan Cove, located across the inlet from the airport, was the proposed site of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by Jordan Cove Energy Project. The terminal would have exported liquefied natural gas from an underground pipeline that would have met with existing pipelines near Malin. The terminal and pipeline projects were cancelled in 2021. Oregon Governor Kulongoski expressed various environmental concerns.

<doc id="708363" wikidata="Q527008" url="?curid=708363" title="Marc-Antoine Parseval">
<text>Marc-Antoine Parseval des Chênes (27 April 1755 – 16 August 1836) was a French mathematician, most famous for what is now known as Parseval&#x27;s theorem, which showed that the Fourier transform is unitary.

He was born in Rosières-aux-Salines, France, into an aristocratic French family, and married Ursule Guerillot in 1795, but divorced her soon after. A monarchist opposed to the French Revolution, imprisoned in 1792, Parseval later fled the country for publishing poetry critical of the government of Napoleon.

Later, he was nominated to the French Academy of Sciences five times, from 1796 to 1828, but was never elected. His only mathematical publications were apparently five papers, published in 1806 as &quot;Mémoires présentés à l&#x27;Institut des Sciences, Lettres et Arts, par divers savants, et lus dans ses assemblées. Sciences mathématiques et physiques. (Savants étrangers.)&quot; This combined the following earlier monographs:

# &quot;Mémoire sur la résolution des équations aux différences partielles linéaires du second ordre,&quot; (5 May 1798).
# &quot;Mémoire sur les séries et sur l&#x27;intégration complète d&#x27;une équation aux différences partielles linéaires du second ordre, à coefficients constants,&quot; (5 April 1799).
# &quot;Intégration générale et complète des équations de la propagation du son, l&#x27;air étant considéré avec ses trois dimensions,&quot; (5 July 1801).
# &quot;Intégration générale et complète de deux équations importantes dans la mécanique des fluides,&quot; (16 August 1803).
# &quot;Méthode générale pour sommer, par le moyen des intégrales définies, la suite donnée par le théorème de M. Lagrange, au moyen de laquelle il trouve une valeur qui satisfait à une équation algébrique ou transcendante,&quot; (7 May 1804).

It was in the second 1799, memoir in which he stated, but did not prove (claiming it to be self-evident), the theorem that now bears his name. He further expanded it upon his 1801 memoir, and used it to solve various differential equations. The theorem was first printed in 1800 as a part (p. 377) of &quot;Traité des différences et des séries&quot; by Lacroix.

<text>The Yaquina River ( ) is a stream, long, on the Pacific coast of the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains an area of the Central Oregon Coast Range west of the Willamette Valley near Newport.

It rises in the mountains west of Corvallis along the county line between Benton and Lincoln counties. It flows south, then generally west, in a highly serpentine course, past Eddyville, Chitwood, Toledo, and Elk City, and enters the Pacific in Yaquina Bay, a broad estuary at Newport. When sea level was lower than today, the Yaquina River reached to Stonewall Bank, which is split by a rocky channel.

U.S. Route 20, the Corvallis–Newport highway, follows the river from Eddyville, at the confluence of the river with Little Elk Creek, to slightly downstream of Chitwood. Near the mouth of Yaquina Bay, the river passes under Yaquina Bay Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 101. Other bridges over the river include the Chitwood Covered Bridge at Chitwood.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Pacific Marine Center and the Hatfield Marine Science Center are both along Yaquina Bay. Adjacent to the Hatfield Center is the Oregon Coast Aquarium. The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, contained within the Yaquina Bay State Recreation Site, is on the coast near the mouth of the river.

==Fishing==
A large charter fishing fleet operates out of Newport in search of halibut, salmon, and other fish found in the nearby ocean. Species within the bay include cabezon, striped perch, rockfish, greenling, salmon, sturgeon, herring, and crabs. The river upstream of the bay supports populations of salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout. The river and bay are also fished from the banks in places and from small boats. Boat-launching ramps are available along the lower river and the bay.

<text>UniQ Aotearoa (UniQ) was Queer Students&#x27; Association of New Zealand, a collection of queer student groups at universities, polytechs and colleges of education in New Zealand.

UniQ was active at most New Zealand universities and several polytechnics. The term queer was considered to had been reclaimed and was used by UniQ to acknowledge both gender and sexual diversity. It was considered to be collective term for non-heterosexual and non-cisgender identities; inclusive but not exclusive to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, takatāpui, intersex and asexual people.

The name &#x27;UniQ&#x27; comes from the name given to the work carried out by Matt Soeberg. Soeberg was employed as a Queer Project Worker by New Zealand Union of Students&#x27; Associations (NZUSA) to address the needs of queer students. The overall name given to the work was &#x27;UNIQ - Creating Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students&#x27; which was eventually adopted by various student groups as their name.

UniQ worked to promote education and understanding for and about queer students undertaking tertiary study and regular events held around New Zealand&#x27;s tertiary institutions. This included &quot;Pride Week&quot; when local UniQs facilitate a week-long series of events usually culminating in a dance party.

== Members ==
UniQ Aotearoa was made up of various local iterations of UniQ and other queer student groups at different universities and polytechs across New Zealand.
== National Conferences ==
UniQ used to meet once annually at a national conference, starting from 1997. Initially known as the Queer Youth and Students (UniQ) Conference, these conferences were opportunities for students across New Zealand to come together to discuss and address the wide range of current issues facing queer students. These conferences usually included workshops, planning sessions and guest speakers (including political, religious and disabled speakers).

<doc id="708368" wikidata="Q461489" url="?curid=708368" title="Stephanie Tubbs Jones">
<text>Stephanie Tubbs Jones (September 10, 1949 – August 20, 2008) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for Ohio&#x27;s 11th congressional district from 1999 until her death in 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, her district encompassed most of Downtown and Eastern Cleveland and many of the eastern suburbs in Cuyahoga County, including Euclid, Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights. She was the first African American woman to be elected to Congress from Ohio.

On December 19, 2006, Tubbs Jones was named Chairwoman of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for the 110th Congress. She was also a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. On August 19, 2008, Tubbs Jones was found unconscious in her car, having suffered a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm. She was taken to an East Cleveland hospital, where she died the next day.

==Early life, education and family==
Tubbs Jones was born in Cleveland, the daughter of Mary, a factory worker and cook, and Andrew Tubbs, an airline skycap. She graduated from the city&#x27;s Collinwood High School. She earned an undergraduate degree from Case Western Reserve University, graduating with a degree in Social Work from the Flora Stone Mather College in 1971. In 1974, she earned a Juris Doctor from the Case Western Reserve University School of Law.

On November 27, 1976, she married Mervyn L. Jones. Less than a year before they married, Mervyn Jones had been charged with aggravated murder and robbery. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser count of manslaughter and received &quot;shock probation.&quot; The couple were married for 27 years until Mervyn&#x27;s death, October 2, 2003. They had one son, Mervyn Leroy Jones Jr. Tubbs Jones was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. She was actively involved in the National Five Point Thrust Programs of her sorority, particularly Social Action and Political Awareness as an integral part of &quot;Delta Days at the Nations Capital&quot;.

Tubbs Jones was Golden Life Member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

==Political and legal career==
Tubbs Jones was elected a judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court (1981) and subsequently served on the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County (1983–91).

In 1990, she ran for Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio replacing Mary Cacioppo, the winner of the Democratic Primary, who withdrew for health reasons. She narrowly lost that race to Republican incumbent J. Craig Wright.
She then served as the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor from 1991 until resigning in early 1999 to take her seat in Congress. She was the first African American prosecutor in Ohio history, and during her tenure she was the only black woman to serve as prosecutor in any major American city. She was succeeded as prosecutor by William D. Mason.

Tubbs Jones served as board member of Hawken School from 1996–2004.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1998, Tubbs Jones won the Democratic nomination for the 11th congressional district after 30-year incumbent Louis Stokes announced his retirement. This all but assured her of election in the heavily Democratic, black-majority 11th. She won with 80 percent of the vote and was reelected four times with no substantive opposition.

Tubbs Jones was a co-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She opposed the Iraq war, voting in 2002 against the use of military force. Despite representing a heavily unionized district, she was a strong proponent of free trade. Tubbs Jones most recently took a lead role in the fight to pass the United States – Peru Trade Promotion Agreement in November 2007.

In 2004, she served as the chairwoman of the platform committee at the Democratic National Convention and as a member of the Ohio delegation. She strongly supported Sen. John Kerry in his campaign to become President of the United States. On January 6, 2005, she joined U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in objecting to the certification of the 2004 U.S. presidential election results for Ohio.
As the sponsor, she was one of the 31 who voted in the House to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 election. Republican President George Bush won the state by 118,457 votes.

In 2005, she came under fire from certain individuals after being named the congressperson with the fourth-highest (59) total trips sponsored by lobbyists. She was selected by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as chairperson of the House Ethics Committee to watch over the standards of ethical conduct for members of the House. 
Tubbs Jones was popular in her district, and was routinely reelected against nominal Republican opposition. She received 83.44% of the vote in her final general election in 2006, against Republican Lindsey String. She faced no opposition in the 2008 Ohio Democratic primary.

Tubbs Jones appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Better Know a District&quot; in an episode which aired November 3, 2005. In the skit, Colbert suggested she create a spin-off vehicle for herself as &quot;Judge Tubbs.&quot; She became a good friend of the show after the broadcast. Colbert paid tribute to Tubbs Jones at the close of his August 27, 2008 broadcast by airing her &quot;Judge Tubbs&quot; footage.

Tubbs Jones was a strong and early supporter of Hillary Clinton in Clinton&#x27;s run for president in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. She later supported Barack Obama after Clinton conceded.

In 2002, Tubbs Jones publicly praised Barbara Byrd-Bennett while she was CEO of the Cleveland Municipal School District, who over a decade later became a confessed, convicted felon due to fraud she committed while she was the CEO of Chicago Public Schools.

==Death==

On August 19, 2008, while driving her car, Congresswoman Tubbs Jones suffered a cerebral hemorrhage due to a burst aneurysm in her brain. Police had noticed erratic driving and identified the unconscious Tubbs Jones after her vehicle left the roadway and came to a stop in a field. She was taken to the intensive care unit of Huron Hospital, a satellite of the Cleveland Clinic, where she was put on life support. Due to hemorrhaging, she remained in unstable and critical condition.

Tubbs Jones died August 20 at 6:12 p.m. EDT of complications from the brain hemorrhage. A special election was ordered by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland for November 18, 2008, to elect a successor to serve out the remainder of her term. Warrensville Heights Mayor Marcia Fudge, the Democratic nominee, won the election.

<text>The 8563 Video Display Controller (VDC) was an integrated circuit produced by MOS Technology. It was used in the Commodore 128 (C128) computer to generate an 80-column (640 × 200 pixel) RGB video display, running alongside a VIC-II which supported Commodore 64-compatible graphics. The DCR models (as well as a few D-models) of the C128 used the later and more technically advanced 8568 [D]VDC controller.

== History and characteristics ==
Originally intended for a planned (but unreleased) UNIX-based business computer based around the Zilog Z8000, Commodore designed the VDC into several prototype machines. Of these, only the Commodore 128 ever saw production. Unlike earlier MOS video chips such as the popular VIC-II, the VDC had dedicated video memory, 16 kilobytes (16,384 bytes; upgradable to 64 kilobytes, 65,536 bytes) in the original or &quot;flat&quot; C128 and 64 kilobytes in the C128DCR. This RAM was not directly accessible by the microprocessor.

The 8563 was more difficult to produce than most of the rest of the MOS Technology line, and initial yields were very low. The early units also had significant reliability problems and tended to self-destruct from overheating. Also, there were timing issues with the VDC that would cause indirect load and store operations on its registers to malfunction.

Officially, the VDC was a text-only chip, although a careful reading of the technical literature by MOS Technology that was given to the early C128 developers did indicate that a high-resolution bitmap mode was possible—it simply wasn&#x27;t described in any detail. BASIC 7.0, the C128&#x27;s built-in programming language, only supported high-resolution graphics in 40-column mode via the legacy VIC-II chip.
Shortly after the release of the C128 the VDC&#x27;s bitmap mode was described in considerable detail in the Data Becker book &quot;Commodore 128 - Das große GRAFIK-Buch&quot; (published in late 1985 in the United States by Abacus Software), and an assembly language program was provided by the German authors Klaus Löffelmann and Dieter Vüllers, in which it was possible to set or clear any pixel or, using BASIC to perform the necessary calculations, generate bitmapped geometric shapes on the 80 column screen. In February 1986, less than a year after the Commodore 128&#x27;s release, &quot;RUN&quot; magazine published &quot;Ultra Hi-Res Graphics&quot;, an article describing the VDC&#x27;s bitmapped mode and including a type-in program (written in 8502 assembly language) that extended BASIC 7.0&#x27;s capabilities to support 640×200 high-resolution graphics using the 8563. Authors Lou Wallace and David Darus later developed the Ultra Hi-Res utility into a commercial package, &quot;BASIC 8&quot;. One of the most popular third-party utilities for the C128, this offered more advanced VDC high-resolution capabilities to a wide audience of programmers.

Commodore finally offered complete official documentation on the VDC in the &quot;Commodore 128 Programmer&#x27;s Reference Guide&quot;. VDC bitmap modes were used extensively in the C128 version of the GEOS operating system.

The VDC lacked sprite capabilities, which limited its use in gaming applications. However, it did contain blitting capabilities to autonomously perform small block memory copies within its dedicated video RAM. While the VDC is performing such a copy, the system CPU can continue running code, provided no other VDC accesses are attempted before the copy is finished. These functions were used by the C128&#x27;s screen editor ROM to rapidly scroll or clear screen sections.

== Technical specifications ==
*RGBI output (RGB plus Intensity) compatible with IBM&#x27;s CGA video standard.*
*16 or 64 kilobyte address space for display, character shape and display attribute memory (dedicated, separate from system memory).
*Up to 720 × 700 pixel video resolution in interlaced mode (maximum with 64 kilobyte video RAM). Other image sizes are possible, depending on programmer&#x27;s needs, such as 640 × 200 non-interlaced, 640 × 400 interlaced, etc.
*80 × 25 characters text resolution (C128 kernal default); other sizes such as 80 × 50 or 40 × 25 are possible.
*8 colors at 2 intensities.
== Programming ==
Addressing the VDC&#x27;s internal registers and dedicated video memory must be accomplished by indirect means. First the program must tell the VDC which of its 37 internal registers is to be accessed. Next the program must wait until the VDC is ready for the access, after which a read or write on the selected internal register may be performed. The following assembly code is typical of a register read:

 ldx #regnum ;VDC register to access
 stx $d600 ;write to control register
 loop bit $d600 ;check bit 7 of status register
 bpl loop ;VDC not ready
 lda $d601 ;read from VDC register


The following code is typical of a register write operation:
 ldx #regnum ;VDC register to write to
 stx $d600 ;write to control register
 loop bit $d600 ;check bit 7 of status register
 bpl loop ;VDC not ready
 sta $d601 ;write to VDC register

The same is feasible in BASIC language, calling specific KERNAL routines :

This code is typical of a VDC register read, where it&#x27;s a number between 0 and 36, as show below.

BANK15
SYS DEC(&quot;CDDA&quot;), register : RREG VDC
REM $ccda aka 52698 in decimal
PRINT VDC


this code is typical of a VDC register write, where it&#x27;s a number between 0 and 36, and it&#x27;s a number between 0 and 255, that you wish to place in that register.
BANK15
SYS DEC(&quot;CDCC&quot;), value, register
REM $ccdc aka 52684 in decimal


Owing to this somewhat cumbersome method of controlling the VDC, the maximum possible frame rate in bitmapped mode is generally too slow for arcade-style action video games, in which bit-intensive manipulation of the display is required.

In standard text mode, the VDC behaves much like the VIC-II except with 2k of screen memory instead of 1k. The power on default configuration places screen memory in and the 
color memory at and they can be moved anywhere in VDC memory as long as it&#x27;s on a 2k boundary. Attributes are handled like the VIC-II&#x27;s high resolution mode with a global background color and each character foreground color set individually per the color RAM. In addition to color data, the latter also contains attribute data for each character. Bit 4 causes the character to blink if enabled, Bit 5 produces underlined characters, and Bit 6 inverts the character&#x27;s bitmap pattern. Bit 7 enables the alternate character set. The VDC can use as many as 512 characters. When the alternate character flag for a given character is enabled, the character pattern will be drawn from characters 256–511. Thus if character 65 is displayed, enabling the alternate character flag will display character 321 instead. The alternate character flag is normally used when upper/lowercase mode is set—the flag is enabled for all VDC screen positions, causing the upper/lowercase character set and its reverse video versions to be displayed instead of the default uppercase/graphics character set.

The VDC does not use a character ROM, instead the VIC-II&#x27;s character ROM patterns are simply copied into VDC RAM as part of the C128&#x27;s power on initialization including the patterns for reverse video characters even though the VDC is capable of inverting characters in hardware. Character patterns take 16 bytes instead of 8 to store as the VDC has adjustable character height. Since the screen is 25 lines, in practice character height is limited to 8 lines meaning that half the space for character data is left unused and wasted. The power on default configuration places the character data in . contain the patterns for the uppercase/graphics characters, the upper/lowercase characters, while and contain the reverse video patterns for each set. The user may freely define any custom characters and map them into VDC memory.

<text>The Defenders are a set of superhero groups with rotating membership appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are usually presented as a &quot;non-team&quot; of individualistic &quot;outsiders&quot; who, in their prior adventures, are known for following their own agendas. The team often battle mystic and supernatural threats.

Its original incarnation was led by Doctor Strange and included Hulk, Namor, and Silver Surfer. They first appeared as the Defenders in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #1 (Dec. 1971), before receiving their own title, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, in 1972.

The group had a rotating line-up from 1972 until 1986, with Dr. Strange and the Hulk being usually constant members along with a number of other mainstays such as Valkyrie, Nighthawk, Hellcat, Gargoyle, Beast, the Son of Satan and Luke Cage, and many temporary members. The publication was retitled near the end of the run as &quot;The New Defenders&quot; but featured none of the original members and only Valkyrie, Beast and the Gargoyle of the former long-term members. The concept was modified in the 1993–95 series &quot;Secret Defenders,&quot; in which Dr. Strange assembled different teams for each individual mission. The original team was reunited in a short-lived 2001 series by Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen. In 2005 Marvel published a five-issue miniseries featuring the classic line-up by J. M. DeMatteis, Keith Giffen and Kevin Maguire. In December 2011 writer Matt Fraction and artist Terry Dodson launched a &quot;Defenders&quot; series with a mixture of classic and new members, which lasted for 12 issues.

A television miniseries &quot;The Defenders&quot; premiered in 2017 on Netflix, with the team consisting of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist.

==Publication history==
The origin of the Defenders lies in two crossover story arcs by Roy Thomas prior to the official founding of the team. The first, in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; #183 (November 1969), &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #22 (February 1970), and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #126 (April 1970) occurred due to the &quot;Dr. Strange&quot; series being canceled in the middle of a story arc, leaving Thomas no choice but to resolve the storyline in other series that he wrote. In the story, Dr. Strange teams with Sub-Mariner and the Hulk to protect the Earth from invasion by Lovecraftian interplanar beings known as the Undying Ones and their leader, the Nameless One. Barbara Norriss, later the host of the Valkyrie, first appears in this story. In the second arc, featured in &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #34–35 (February–March 1971), Namor enlists the aid of the Silver Surfer and the Hulk to stop a potentially devastating weather control experiment, inadvertently freeing a small island nation from a dictator and facing the Avengers under the name of the &quot;Titans Three&quot;.

The Defenders first appeared as a feature in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #1 (December 1971), where the founding members gather to battle the alien techno-wizard Yandroth and remain as a team afterward. Editor Stan Lee, wanting to write all of the Silver Surfer&#x27;s stories personally, had asked other writers not to use the character, and suggested that Thomas use Doctor Strange instead. Thomas has also speculated that Lee came up with the team&#x27;s name: &quot;The &#x27;Defenders&#x27; is far too passive a name for my taste. I prefer more aggressive-sounding names like the &#x27;Avengers&#x27; or the &#x27;Invaders,&#x27; so Stan probably came up with that one.&quot; Due to the popularity of their tryout in &quot;Marvel Feature&quot;, Marvel soon began publishing &quot;The Defenders&quot; with Steve Englehart writing and Sal Buscema penciling, while Thomas moved into the editor&#x27;s seat. Despite Lee&#x27;s continuing edict on the use of the Silver Surfer, he approved Englehart&#x27;s pitch to include the Silver Surfer in the story.

Valkyrie was introduced to the team in issue #4 (February 1973). Englehart wrote &quot;The Avengers–Defenders War&quot; crossover in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #116–118 (October–December 1973) and &quot;The Defenders&quot; #9–11 (October–December 1973), leaving &quot;The Defenders&quot; afterwards because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to keep doing two team books at the same time.&quot; Len Wein briefly wrote the series and introduced such characters as Alpha the Ultimate Mutant and the Wrecking Crew. Wein also added Nighthawk to the cast because, in his words, doing so &quot;gave me a character to play with who didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of previous history ... [a] character I could do anything I wanted to without worrying about how it would affect any other titles that character might appear in.&quot;

Steve Gerber first worked on the characters in &quot;Giant-Size Defenders&quot; #3 (January 1975) and became the writer of the main title with issue #20 the following month. He wrote the series until issue #41 (November 1976). Part of Gerber&#x27;s oeuvre was reviving forgotten characters; he brought back three pre-Marvel characters, now organized as the Headmen, as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. The Defenders met Gerber&#x27;s Howard the Duck in &quot;Marvel Treasury Edition&quot; #12 (1976).

Due to Marvel&#x27;s shuffling of editors-in-chief, a brief run by Gerry Conway abruptly ended in mid-production on issue #45. David Anthony Kraft and Roger Slifer volunteered to write the series, but issue #45 had no written plot, having been drawn by Giffen following a story conference with Conway. Kraft and Slifer were unable to contact either Conway or Giffen, and so had to puzzle out Conway&#x27;s plot from the unscripted artwork.

David Anthony Kraft&#x27;s run as writer included &quot;The Scorpio Saga&quot; (issues #46, 48–50) and the &quot;Xenogenesis: Day of the Demons&quot; storyline (issues #58–60). The &quot;Defenders for a Day&quot; storyline in issues #62–64 saw dozens of new applicants attempting to join the Defenders, as well as a number of villains attempting to present themselves as Defenders members in order to confuse the authorities and the public as they commit robberies. Kraft and artist Ed Hannigan explained some of the Valkyrie&#x27;s backstory in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #66–68 (December 1978 – February 1979). At Kraft&#x27;s request, Hannigan helped write issue #67 but found that he could not handle both writing and artwork at once, and so transitioned to being just the series&#x27;s writer with the following issue.

Steven Grant wrote a conclusion to Steve Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Omega the Unknown&quot; series in two issues of &quot;The Defenders&quot;, at the end of which most of the original series&#x27; characters were killed. While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant&#x27;s conclusion, it nevertheless tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered &quot;canon&quot; by Marvel.

Writer J. M. DeMatteis took over the series with issue #92. He and Mark Gruenwald co-wrote &quot;The Defenders&quot; #107–109 (May–July 1982), which resolved remaining plot points from the Valkyrie story by Kraft and Hannigan published three years earlier.

===&quot;The New Defenders&quot;===
As of issue #125, &quot;The Defenders&quot; was retitled to &quot;The New Defenders&quot; as the original four members (Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, and Namor) are forced to leave the team, in response to an alien prophecy that states that these four, operating as a group, would be responsible for destroying the world. While The Beast reforms the team as an official superhero team complete with government clearance.

DeMatteis stayed on for only six issues of &quot;The New Defenders&quot; before turning it over to writer Peter Gillis, whose run was marked by shorter, more personal stories. Gillis recounted, &quot;I had been working for a while at Marvel, and was constantly pumping for more work, and specifically a series of my own. So when I heard DeMatteis was leaving &quot;Defenders&quot;, I was in [editor] Carl Potts&#x27; office like a shot, and I got the gig.&quot;

Though the series remained a modest hit through the Gillis/Perlin run, it was cancelled to make room in Marvel&#x27;s production schedule for the New Universe line. The final issue was &quot;The New Defenders&quot; #152. In the final issue, several members (Gargoyle, Moondragon and Valkyrie), plus allies (Andromeda, Manslaughter, Interloper) seemingly die in battle with the Dragon of the Moon controlling Moondragon. The remaining mutant members leave the team to join X-Factor. Gillis has claimed that killing off the other members of the group was a directive from the editorial staff to free up the surviving members for usage in &quot;X-Factor&quot;, pointing out that he shortly after revived several of these seemingly-deceased members in issues of &quot;Solo Avengers&quot;, in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 2 #5–7, followed by issues #3–4 of the relaunched &quot;Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme&quot; series.

===The Return of the Defenders===
In 1990, the original trio reunited in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #370–371, in which it was revealed that the prophecy was a hoax. The originals then rejoined with the Silver Surfer in a story entitled &quot;The Return of the Defenders&quot; running in &quot;The Incredible Hulk Annual&quot; #18, &quot;Namor the Sub-Mariner Annual&quot; #2, &quot;Silver Surfer Annual&quot; #5, and &quot;Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Annual&quot; #2.

===Secret Defenders===
In 1993, Marvel sought to revive the &quot;Defenders&quot; brand as &quot;The Secret Defenders&quot;. The new team first appeared, unofficially, in &quot;Dr. Strange&quot; #50 and later &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #374, before being officially introduced in &quot;Secret Defenders&quot; #1. The series&#x27; premise originally was that Doctor Strange would organize various teams of heroes for certain missions, with him as the leader. Members included Wolverine, Darkhawk, Spider-Woman, Spider-Man, Hulk, Nomad, Ghost Rider, and others. This lasted for the first several months of the title, before Doctor Strange was removed from the book, due to the character being reassigned to the &quot;Midnight Sons&quot; line at Marvel. After an arc where the supervillain Thanos organized a team of &quot;Secret Defenders&quot; for a mission, leadership of the Secret Defenders passed to Doctor Druid and the series itself abandoned the revolving-door roster in favor of Druid and the Cognoscenti. The series was canceled with &quot;Secret Defenders&quot; #25.

===Reunion and The Order===
In 2001–02, the Defenders reunited in &quot;Defenders&quot; (vol. 2) #1–12 created by Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen, immediately followed by &quot;The Order&quot; #1–6, in which Yandroth manipulated Gaea into &quot;cursing&quot; the primary four Defenders (Doctor Strange, the Sub-Mariner, the Hulk, and the Silver Surfer) so that they would be summoned to major crisis situations. These members were then mind controlled by Yandroth into forming the world-dominating &quot;Order&quot;; once the Order were freed from this control by their fellow heroes (including their teammates Hellcat, Nighthawk, and Valkyrie), the Defenders apparently disbanded. A fill-in issue set between these two series was published in 2011.

===2005 miniseries===
A &quot;Defenders&quot; five-issue miniseries debuted in July 2005, by Keith Giffen, J. M. DeMatteis, and Kevin Maguire, featuring Doctor Strange attempting to reunite the original four Defenders to battle Dormammu and Umar. This series focuses mostly on humor as the characters spend most of their time arguing with and criticizing one another.

===The Last Defenders===
In 2008, Joe Casey wrote a new miniseries with a new line-up of Defenders, following the aftermath of &quot;Civil War&quot;. Nighthawk wanted a team made up of previous Defenders such as Hellcat and Devil Slayer but Tony Stark (Iron Man) makes the decision to select other heroes for the team. The line-up is led by Nighthawk, with Blazing Skull, Colossus, and She-Hulk as members. The Defenders are assigned to New Jersey under the Fifty State Initiative, because the proximity to New York City demands more experienced heroes than can just be recruited from the ranks of Camp Hammond. The team is disbanded for incompetence but Richmond eventually founds a team outside the Initiative with the Son of Satan, She-Hulk, Krang, and Nighthawk (S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Joaquin Pennyworth). The team reappears in the mini-series &quot;Vengeance&quot; (2011).

===The Offenders===
In the 2009 ongoing &quot;Hulk&quot; series (Issues #10–12), Red Hulk assembles a counter team of supervillains called the Offenders, which includes Baron Mordo, Terrax, and Tiger Shark, and fights past versions of their enemies.

===&quot;Fear Itself: The Deep&quot;===
During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Doctor Strange forms a new version of the Defenders with Lyra (daughter of Hulk), Namor, Loa (a student of the X-Men), and the Silver Surfer to confront Attuma who has become Nerkkod, Breaker of Oceans. Many past Defenders appear in the last issue.

===2011 series===
Marvel launched a new &quot;Defenders&quot; series in December 2011, written by Matt Fraction and drawn by Terry Dodson. The new book features Doctor Strange, Red She-Hulk, Namor, Silver Surfer, and Iron Fist. The new series follows the reunion of the Defenders in &quot;Fear Itself: The Deep&quot;. During the battle against the Death Celestials, the characters Black Cat, Nick Fury, and Ant-Man join the team. The series was cancelled at issue #12. Despite the prophecy supposedly being a hoax, the central storyline of the series involves a reunion of the original four Defenders setting off a chain of events leading to the destruction of the universe. In the final issue, Strange changes the past so that the reunion never happens, thus erasing all the events of the series.

===The Fearless Defenders===

February 2013 saw the debut of &quot;The Fearless Defenders&quot;, a series written by Cullen Bunn with artwork by Will Sliney. Bunn said that he had wanted to write the series, which centers on a new team of Valkyrior, led by Valkyrie and Misty Knight, after writing &quot;Fear Itself: The Fearless&quot;. It was suggested to him that it should run as a Defenders title, however Bunn explained that beyond the name there is &quot;little connection&quot; to the Defenders.

===2017 series===

In August 2017, Marvel launched a new Defenders comic book series starring Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, based on the Netflix incarnation of the team.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, the Defenders were seen fighting the villains that were on a rampage for what happened in Pleasant Hill. They were defeated when Nitro exploded.

===The Best Defense===
2018 saw a new five part crossover storyline involving the &quot;Big Four&quot; members of the team. Published throughout December, the plot features separate issues all sub-titled &quot;The Best Defense&quot; in Immortal Hulk, Namor, Doctor Strange and Silver Surfer which culminates in a final issue under the banner of The Defenders. Announced on August 24, 2018, the creative teams were respectively:
*&quot;Immortal Hulk&quot; written by Al Ewing and illustrated by Simone Di Meo
*&quot;Namor&quot; written by Chip Zdarsky and illustrated by Carlos Magno
*&quot;Doctor Strange&quot; written by Gerry Duggan and illustrated by Greg Smallwood
*&quot;Silver Surfer&quot; written and illustrated by Jason Latour
*&quot;The Defenders&quot; written by Al Ewing and illustrated by Joe Bennet.

===2021 series===
In August 2021, Marvel launched a new Defenders series. Written by Al Ewing with art by Javier Rodriguez, this new version of the team features Doctor Strange, Silver Surfer, Masked Raider, Red Harpy and Cloud.

===Defenders: Beyond===
Before the publication of the fifth and final issue of the 2021 series it was teased that the team would be returning after a short break in summer 2022 for another five part run. Following a message from beyond the grave from Doctor Strange, a new team is assembled featuring Blue Marvel, America Chavez, Taaia (the mother of Galactus), Tigra, and Loki (a variant of the God of Mischief) to tackle a new cosmic threat.

==Membership==
Defenders membership was fluid, yet a few members were relatively constant: the three founders (Doctor Strange, Namor, and Hulk), Silver Surfer, Valkyrie, Nighthawk, Hellcat, and Gargoyle. Membership was clearer in the New Defenders era when the team was more formally organized.

===Secret Defenders===
This group&#x27;s composition was even more fluid than that of the original Defenders, but typically included either Doctor Strange or Doctor Druid as leader, joined by a custom selection of heroes chosen for the mission at hand. At various times, War Machine, Darkhawk, Thunderstrike, Wolverine, Spider-Woman, Ant-Man, Iceman, Nomad, and many others were members. At the end of its existence, the group had a somewhat regular composition, including Cadaver, Sepulchre, Joshua Pryce, and Druid.

<text>The Siletz River flows about to the Pacific Ocean through coastal mountains in the U.S. state of Oregon. Formed by the confluence of its north and south forks near Valsetz in Polk County, it winds through the Central Oregon Coast Range. The river, draining a watershed of , empties into Siletz Bay, south of Lincoln City in Lincoln County. Although the river travels in river miles, its winding course begins only about east of the ocean, and its mouth and source latitudes are almost identical.

==Course==
The river begins slightly east of the Polk–Lincoln county border in the Central Oregon Coast Range. Flowing west, it crosses into Lincoln County, returns to Polk County, then re-enters Lincoln County for the last time about from the mouth. Blind Creek enters from the left about further on. Flowing generally southwest, the river receives Elk and then Holman creeks from the right, Sunshine Creek from the left, Buck Creek from the right, followed by Wolfer Creek from the left at about river mile (RM) 57 or river kilometer (RK) 92. About later, the river turns west and soon receives Wildcat Creek from the right. For parts of its course along its upper reaches, the river flows near non-contiguous parcels of land belonging to the Siletz Reservation.

Turning southwest and then south, the Siletz receives Palmer Creek from the right, flows by Moonshine County Park, then receives Baker Creek and Mill Creek from the left before reaching Logsden, about from the mouth. Passing under Rock Creek Road and receiving Rock Creek from the left, the river turns west again and soon receives Scott Creek from the right, Sam Creek from the left, and Bentilla and Baker creeks, both from the right. Continuing south and then west parallel to Upper Siletz Road, the river passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge and reaches Siletz at about RM 41 (RK 66). At Siletz, the river receives Mill and Dewey creeks from the left. Following a series of meanders that carry it under Oregon Route 229 twice and almost completely around the city of Siletz, the river heads north, roughly parallel to Route 229, which runs near it all the way to Siletz Bay. In the next stretch, the river receives Tangerman, Spencer. and Thompson creeks, all from the right.

Turning west about from the mouth, the river flows under Route 229 at Ojalla Bridge and then receives Ojalla Creek from the left at RM 30 (RK 48). Meandering north, then east, then north again, the Siletz receives Euchre Creek and Reed creeks from the right. After another sharp turn to the west from the mouth, the river flows by Jack Morgan County Park and receives Chitwood, Hough, and Wade creeks, all from the right. Cedar and Misac creeks then enter from the right, Jaybird Creek from the left, and, from the mouth, Roy Creek from the left. Over the next , the river again doubles back on itself, flowing west, then north, then east until it is near Roy Creek again, then turns north. It receives Roots, Skalada, Townsend, and Stemple creeks in quick succession, all from the right, near RM 15 (RK 24). Shortly thereafter, Scare Creek enters from the left.

Butterfield Creek enters from the left just before the river makes another sharp turn to the east, receiving Foster Creek from the left and Reed Creek from the right about from the mouth. Turning north and then west again, the river over the next receives Bear, Skunk, Barhaven, and Anderson creeks, all from the right. A distributary, Millport Slough, branches to the left from the main stem as the river nears Siletz Bay and the Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The river reaches Kernville, passes under U.S. Route 101 and enters the bay.

===Discharge===
The USGS monitors the flow of the Siletz River at a station east of Siletz and from the mouth. The average flow of the river at this station is . This is from a drainage area of , or about 54 percent of the total Siletz River watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on November 28, 1999, and the minimum flow was on September 5–6, 2003. Tides affect the flow along the last of the river.

==Fishing==
The river has been described as &quot;a fine all-around stream&quot; with good accessibility. Sport fish include fall chinook salmon, summer and winter steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Fishing by boat is most common between Moonshine Park and Jack Morgan Park. The city of Siletz has a boat ramp, parking, and a picnic area along the river, and the lower river and bay have many moorages offering boats and fishing equipment.

<text>The Siuslaw River ( ) is a river, about long, that flows to the Pacific Ocean coast of Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of about in the Central Oregon Coast Range southwest of the Willamette Valley and north of the watershed of the Umpqua River.

It rises in the mountains of southwestern Lane County, about west of Cottage Grove. It flows generally west-northwest through the mountains, past Swisshome, entering the Pacific at Florence. The head of tide is upstream.

It is part of the homeland of the Siuslaw people, after whom it is named. Citizens of the Siuslaw nation lived in villages along the river until 1860 when they were forcibly removed to an Indian reservation in Yachats whereupon their homes, farms, gardens and villages were destroyed and occupied by U.S. settler-colonists.

The valley of the river has been one of the productive timber regions in Oregon. The lower course of the river passes through Siuslaw National Forest.

The Coos Bay branch of the Coos Bay Rail Link crosses many bridges as it follows the narrow, winding valley of the Siuslaw River to the swing bridge at Cushman.

The river has historically been a spawning ground for Chinook and coho salmon. Although the Chinook population is substantial, coho numbers have declined from an annual average of 209,000 fish between 1889 and 1896 to just over 3,000 fish between 1990 and 1995. The estuary of the river is surrounded by extensive wetlands that are a significant habitat for migratory birds along the coast. It is one of the very few Western Oregon rivers where all major forks are undammed.

<text>In the Book of Genesis, Dinah (; ) was the seventh child and only daughter of Leah and Jacob. The episode of her rape by Shechem, son of a Canaanite or Hivite prince, and the subsequent vengeance of her brothers Simeon and Levi, commonly referred to as &quot;the rape of Dinah&quot;, is told in Genesis 34.

==In Genesis==

Dinah is first mentioned in Genesis 30:21 as the daughter of Leah and Jacob, born to Leah after she bore six sons to Jacob. In Genesis 34, Dinah went out to visit the women of Shechem, where her people had made camp and where her father Jacob had purchased the land where he had pitched his tent. Shechem (son of Hamor, the prince of the land) then took her and raped her, but how this text is to be exactly translated and understood is the subject of scholarly controversy.

Shechem asked his father to obtain Dinah for him, to be his wife. Hamor came to Jacob and asked for Dinah for his son: &quot;Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. You shall dwell with us; and the land shall be open to you.&quot; Shechem offered Jacob and his sons any bride-price they named. But &quot;the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah&quot;; they said they would accept the offer if the men of the city agreed to be circumcised.

So the men of Shechem were deceived, and were circumcised; and &quot;on the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob and Leah, Simeon and Levi, Dinah&#x27;s brothers, took their swords and came upon the city unawares, and killed all the males. They slew Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem&#x27;s house, and went away.&quot; And the sons of Jacob plundered whatever was in the city and in the field, &quot;all their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses&quot;.

&quot;Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &#x27;You have brought trouble on me by making me odious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.&#x27; But they said, &#x27;Should he treat our sister as a harlot? (Genesis 34:31).

===Last mention of Dinah in the Bible===
When Jacob&#x27;s family prepares to descend to Egypt, Genesis lists the 70 family members who went down together (Genesis 46:8–27). Dinah is specifically listed, in verse 15 (&quot;These are the sons of Leah, that she bore to Jacob in Padan Aram, and Dinah his daughter.&quot;). Dovid Rosenfeld states that &quot;That is it. The Torah does not tell us anything about what happened to her for the remainder of her life, nor if she ever married and raised a family&quot;.

===Origin of Genesis 34===

Chapter 34 of the Book of Genesis deals primarily with the family of Abraham and his descendants, including Dinah, her father Jacob, and her brothers. The traditional view is that Moses wrote Genesis as well as almost all the rest of the Torah, doubtlessly using varied sources but synthesizing all of them together to give the Hebrews a written history of their ancestors. This view—which has been held for the past several thousand years, although it is not explicitly mentioned in either the Hebrew or the Christian Bible—holds that Moses included this story primarily because it happened and he viewed it as significant. It foreshadows later happenings and prophecies further along in Genesis and the Torah dealing with the two violent brothers.

Source-critical scholars speculate that Genesis combines separate literary strands, with different values and concerns, and does not pre-date the 1st millennium BC as a unified account. Within Genesis 34 itself, they suggest two layers of narrative: an older account ascribing the killing of Shechem to Simeon and Levi alone, and a later addition (verses 27 to 29) involving all the sons of Jacob. Kirsch argues that the narrative combines a Yahwist narrator describing a rape, and an Elohist speaker describing a seduction.

On the other hand, another critical scholar, Alexander Rofé, assumes that the earlier authors would not have considered rape to be defilement in and of itself, and posits that the verb describing Dinah as &quot;defiled&quot; was added later (elsewhere in the Bible, only married or betrothed women are &quot;defiled&quot; by rape). He instead says that such a description reflected a &quot;late, post-exilic notion that the idolatrous gentiles are impure [and supports] the prohibition of intermarriage and intercourse with them.&quot; Such a supposed preoccupation with ethnic purity must therefore indicate a late date for Genesis in the 5th or 4th centuries BC, when the restored Jewish community in Jerusalem was similarly preoccupied with anti-Samaritan polemics. In Rofé&#x27;s analysis, the &quot;defilement&quot; refers to interracial sex rather than rape.

==In rabbinic literature==
Midrashic literature contains a series of proposed explanations of the Bible by rabbis. It provides further hypotheses of the story of Dinah, suggesting answers to questions such as her offspring: Osnat a daughter from Shechem, and links to later incidents and characters.

One midrash states that Dinah was conceived as a male in Leah&#x27;s womb but miraculously changed to a female, lest the maid-servants (Bilhah and Zilpah) be associated with more of the Israelite tribes than Rachel.

Another midrash implicates Jacob in Dinah&#x27;s misfortune: when he went to meet Esau, he locked Dinah in a box, for fear that Esau would wish to marry her, but God rebuked him in these words: &quot;If thou hadst married off thy daughter in time she would not have been tempted to sin, and might, moreover, have exerted a beneficial influence upon her husband&quot;. Her brother Simeon promised to find a husband for her, but she did not wish to leave Shechem, fearing that, after her disgrace, no one would take her to wife. However, she was later married to Job. When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. She is therefore referred to as &quot;the Canaanitish woman&quot; (Genesis 46:10). Joseph&#x27;s wife Asenath (ib.) was her daughter by Shechem.

Early Christian commentators such as Jerome likewise assign some of the responsibility to Dinah, in venturing out to visit the women of Shechem. This story was used to demonstrate the danger to women in the public sphere as contrasted with the relative security of remaining in private.

===Simeon and Levi===

On his deathbed, their father Jacob curses Simeon and Levi&#x27;s &quot;anger&quot; (Genesis 49). Their tribal portions in the land of Israel are dispersed so that they would not be able to regroup and fight arbitrarily. According to the Midrash, Simeon and Levi were only 14 and 13 years old, respectively, at the time of the rape of Dinah. They possessed great moral zealousness (later, in the episode of the Golden Calf, the Tribe of Levi would demonstrate their absolute commitment to Moses&#x27; leadership by killing all the people involved in idol worship), but their anger was misdirected here.

One midrash told how Jacob later tried to restrain their hot tempers by dividing their portions in the land of Israel, and neither had lands of their own. Therefore, Dinah&#x27;s son by Shechem was counted among Simeon&#x27;s progeny and received a portion of land in Israel, Dinah herself being &quot;the Canaanite woman&quot; mentioned among those who went down into Egypt with Jacob and his sons (Genesis 46:10). When she died, Simeon buried her in the land of Canaan. (According to another tradition, her child from her rape by Shechem was Asenath, the wife of Joseph, and she herself later married the prophet Job.) The Tribe of Simeon received land within the territory of Judah and served as itinerant teachers in Israel, traveling from place to place to earn a living.

In the Hebrew Bible, the tribe of Levi received a few Cities of Refuge spread out over Israel, and relied for their sustenance on the priestly gifts that the Children of Israel gave them.

In medieval rabbinic literature, there were efforts to justify the killing, not merely of Shechem and Hamor, but of all the townsmen. Maimonides argued that the killing was understandable because the townsmen had failed to uphold the seventh Noachide law () to establish a criminal justice system. However, Nachmanides disagreed, partly because he viewed the seventh law as a positive commandment that was not punishable by death. Instead, Nachmanides said that the townsmen presumably violated other Noachide laws, such as idolatry or sexual immorality. Later, the Maharal reframed the issue—not as sin, but rather as a war. That is, he argued that Simeon and Levi acted lawfully insofar as they carried out a military operation as an act of vengeance or retribution for the rape of Dinah.

===Travel to Egypt===
The Torah lists the 70 members of Jacob&#x27;s family who went down together into Egypt (Genesis 46:8–27). Simeon&#x27;s children include &quot;Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman&quot; (verse 10). The medieval French rabbi Rashi hypothesized that this Shaul was Dinah&#x27;s son by Shechem. He suggests that after the brothers killed all the men in the city, including Shechem and his father, Dinah refused to leave the palace unless Simeon agreed to marry her and remove her shame (according to Nachmanides, she only lived in his house and did not have sex with him). Therefore, Shaul is counted among Simeon&#x27;s progeny, and he received a portion of land in Israel in the time of Joshua. The list of the names of the families of Israel in Egypt is repeated in Exodus 6:14–25 (including &quot;Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman&quot;, verse 15).

==In apocryphical literature==
In the apocryphal book &quot;Testament of Job&quot;, Dinah is said to have been Job&#x27;s second wife after the death of his first wife, who is referred to as &quot;Sitidos&quot;.

==In culture==
===Symbol of black womanhood===

In 19th-century America, &quot;Dinah&quot; became a generic name for an enslaved African woman. At the 1850 Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in New York, a speech by Sojourner Truth was reported on in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, which used the name &quot;Dinah&quot; to symbolize black womanhood as represented by Truth:

Lizzie McCloud, a slave on a Tennessee plantation during the American Civil War, recalled that Union soldiers called all enslaved women &quot;Dinah&quot;. Describing her fear when the Union army arrived, she said: &quot;We was so scared we run under the house and the Yankees called &#x27;Come out Dinah&#x27; (didn&#x27;t call none of us anything but Dinah). They said &#x27;Dinah, we&#x27;re fightin&#x27; to free you and get you out from under bondage&#x27;.&quot; After the end of the war in 1865 &quot;The New York Times&quot; exhorted the newly liberated slaves to demonstrate that they had the moral values to use their freedom effectively, using the names &quot;Sambo&quot; and &quot;Dinah&quot; to represent male and female former slaves: &quot;You are free Sambo, but you must work. Be virtuous too, oh Dinah!&quot;

The name Dinah was subsequently used for dolls and other images of black women.

===In literature===
The novel &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant is a fictional autobiography of the biblical Dinah. In Diamant&#x27;s version, Dinah falls in love with Shalem, the Canaanite prince, and goes to bed with him in preparation for marriage. Simeon and Levi, Jacob&#x27;s sons, instigate the discord between Jacob and the men of the King of Shechem out of fear for their own prosperity, even though Dinah tells them the truth.

A fictionalized account of Dinah&#x27;s life is included as one of the stories in the short story collection &quot;Sarah and After&quot; by Lynne Reid Banks.

<doc id="708387" wikidata="Q5364108" url="?curid=708387" title="Elk River (Oregon)">
<text>The Elk River is in southwestern Oregon in the United States. About long, the river drains a remote area of the Coast Range into the Pacific Ocean.

Rising in the mountains in northern Curry County, in the Siskiyou National Forest at confluence of its north and south forks, the river initially flows generally west along the south edge of the Grassy Knob Wilderness. It then flows northwest, approaching the coast north of Port Orford and entering the Pacific between Cape Blanco to the north and The Heads to the south.

==Course==
From the confluence of its two forks, Elk River flows generally west and northwest for about . All but the lowermost of it are in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. Forest Road 5325 follows the river along its left bank, becoming County Road 208 (Elk Creek Road) after leaving the national forest. County Road 208 ends when it reaches U.S. Route 101 about by water from the mouth of the river.

In its first stretch, Elk River receives McCurdy and Blackberry creeks from the left, then Bungalow Creek from the right before Milbury Creek enters from the left at river mile (RM) 26 or river kilometer (RK) 42. About further downstream, Butler Creek enters from the right at Butler Bar Campground, and the river becomes the southern border of Grassy Knob Wilderness. Over the next few miles, Lost and Panther creeks enter from the left, then Sunshine Creek from the right near Sunshine Bar Campground, from the river mouth. Below this, Red Cedar and Slate creeks enter from the right and Platinum Creek from the left.

After turning more sharply northwest, the river receives Bald Mountain Creek from the left, leaves the wilderness, and reaches the Elk River State Fish Hatchery. At this point, Anvil Creek enters from the right. Below the hatchery, Chapman Creek enters from the left, the river turns sharply north and meanders along the national forest border, crossing it a total of five times and leaving it on the final crossing. At this point, Rock Creek enters from the right from the mouth. About further downstream, Bagley Creek enters from the left, and below that Indian Creek enters from the right. After Elk River flows under Route 101, it meanders across the coastal flatland and turns north behind sand dunes. It enters the Pacific Ocean between Cape Blanco on the north and Port Orford on the south. In the ocean opposite the mouth are Orford Reef and a portion of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge.

==Recreation==
 Fishing, camping, hiking, swimming, and wildlife viewing are among the forms of recreation pursued in the Elk River watershed. The river and its tributaries support native chinook salmon, coastal cutthroat trout, winter steelhead, and coho salmon. Fishing is permitted within the national forest boundaries only on the of the river below the confluence with Bald Mountain Creek. Downstream of the Elk River Hatchery, about of the river that flows by private land is open for fishing from drift boats.

In 1988, parts of the Elk River and its north fork were designated Wild and Scenic. The lower of the river&#x27;s north fork are classified &quot;wild.&quot; The segment of the main stem from the confluence of the river&#x27;s north and south forks to Anvil Creek is classified &quot;recreational.&quot;

Three national forest campgrounds—Sunshine Bar and Butler Bar near the main stem and Laird Lake near the south fork— are along Forest Road 5325. The river has many pools that are big enough for swimming.

Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run all or part of a stretch of the river between Butler Creek and the Elk River Hatchery. Rapids vary from class 3 to 4 on the International Scale of River Difficulty.

In 2009, along the north and south forks of Elk River and the upper middle fork of Sixes River were designated as the Copper Salmon Wilderness. The area contains one of the nation&#x27;s largest remaining stands of low-elevation old-growth forest and one of the healthiest salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat trout runs in the continental United States. Protected species in the region include Port Orford cedar, marbled murrelets and northern spotted owls.

<doc id="708389" wikidata="Q2412622" url="?curid=708389" title="Smith River (Umpqua River tributary)">
<text>The Smith River is a tributary of the Umpqua River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains of the Central Oregon Coast Range between the watershed of the Umpqua to the south and the Siuslaw River to the north.

Rising in northern Douglas County about north of Drain, the river flows generally west in a winding course through the mountains, passing through the Siuslaw National Forest for about in its lower course. It joins the Umpqua from the north across from Reedsport, about from the mouth of the Umpqua on the Pacific Ocean.

The river is named for Jedediah Smith, who in 1828 led a party of explorers from Utah overland to northern California and southern Oregon. From California, they traveled north to the Umpqua River, camping along its banks near the mouth of the Smith River on July 13. An attack by Native Americans on July 14 killed 15 of Smith&#x27;s party. One man escaped by heading north to Tillamook and then Fort Vancouver. Smith and two others who were not in camp at the time of the attack fled east toward the Willamette Valley and survived. The Smith River in California is also named for Smith.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries of the Smith River from source to mouth are Spring, Whiskey, Alder, Watering Trough, Sleezer, Tip Davis, Peterson, Redford, and Hall creeks. Then Summit, Hefty, Plank, Clevenger, Beaver, Elk, and Arthur Jones creeks. Next is the South Fork Smith River followed by Salmonberry, Amberson, Panther, Haney, Huckleberry, Deer, Yellow, and Hardenbrook creeks.

Next, continuing downstream, are Cleghorn, Johnson, Slideout, Clabber, Halfway, Mosetown, Blind, Rock, Marsh, Devils Club, South Sister and North Sister creeks. Then Beaver, Carpenter, Coldwater, Clearwater, Blackwell, and Scare creeks. Next is the West Fork Smith River followed by Vincent, Rachel, Johnson, Bear, Little Buck, and Buck creeks.

Then come Fawn, Doe, Dailey, Spencer, Taylor, Wasson, and Murphy creeks. Next is the North Fork Smith River followed by Russian John Gulch, then Eslick, Noel, Cassidy, Joyce, Black, and Brainard creeks. Below that are Otter Slough, Camp Seven Gulch, Hudson Slough, Frantz Creek, and Butler Creek.

<doc id="708393" wikidata="Q6987903" url="?curid=708393" title="Nehru Planetarium">
<text>Nehru Planetariums are the five planetariums in India, named after India&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. These are located in Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune and Bangalore, plus there is a Jawahar Planetarium in Allahabad, where Jawaharlal Nehru was born.

The Nehru Planetarium in New Delhi is situated on the grounds of Teen Murti Bhavan, previously known as &#x27;Nehru Memorial Museum and Library&#x27;, earlier the official residence of India&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru and now a museum in his memory. In 1964, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund was set up to promote his ideas and it undertook to build the Nehru Planetarium with its aim being the promotion of astronomy education. This planetarium, like its namesake in Mumbai, was also inaugurated by Smt. Indira Gandhi on 6 February 1984. One of the major attractions of this place is the Soyuz T-10 which carried India&#x27;s first cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma to space, along with his space suit and mission journal.

The Sky Theatre shown at Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium are very popular and attracts more than 200,000 visitors per year. The sky theatre is a dome shaped theatre. It shows information on constellations and planets. Visuals such as cartoons, paintings, computer animations, video clippings and special effects are liberally used in the programmes at the sky theatre.

The planetarium was reopened in September 2010, after renovations worth Rs. 11 crore, ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games and received Queen&#x27;s Baton. It now has &#x27;Definiti optical star projector &quot;Megastar&quot; that can show 2 million stars. It also sets up old telescopes, projection boxes and solar filters at its premises at major solar eclipses.

<doc id="708395" wikidata="Q908531" url="?curid=708395" title="Keturah">
<text>Keturah (, &quot;Qəṭūrā&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;incense&quot;; ) was a wife and a concubine of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. According to the Book of Genesis, Abraham married Keturah after the death of his first wife, Sarah. Abraham and Keturah had six sons. According to Jewish tradition, she was a descendant of Noah&#x27;s son Japheth. (Sumerians story say son of Shem, the priest lineage)

One modern commentator on the Hebrew Bible has called Keturah &quot;the most ignored significant person in the Torah&quot;. The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi, and some previous rabbinical commentators, related a traditional belief that Keturah was the same person as Hagar, although this idea cannot be found in the biblical text. However, Hagar was Sarah&#x27;s Egyptian maidservant.

== Sources ==

Keturah is mentioned in two passages of the Hebrew Bible: in the Book of Genesis and in the First Book of Chronicles. Additionally, she is mentioned in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; by the 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus, in the Talmud, the Midrash, the Targum on the Torah, the Genesis Rabbah, and various other writings of Jewish theologians and philosophers.

Louis Feldman has said &quot;Josephus records evidence of the prolific non-Jewish polymath Alexander Polyhistor, who in turn cites the historian Cleodemus Malchus, who states that two of the sons of Abraham by Keturah joined Heracles&#x27; campaign in Africa, and that Heracles, without doubt the greatest Greek hero of them all, married the daughter of one of them.&quot;

According to Doctor of Anthropology Paula M. McNutt, it is generally recognized that there is nothing specific in the biblical traditions recorded in Genesis, including those regarding Abraham and his family, that can be definitively related to known history in or around Canaan in the early second millennium B.C.

== Relationship with Abraham ==
Keturah is referred to in Genesis as &quot;another wife&quot; of Abraham (). In First Chronicles, she is called Abraham&#x27;s &quot;concubine&quot; ().

According to one opinion in the midrashic work Genesis Rabbah, Keturah and Hagar are names for the same person, whom Abraham remarried after initially expelling. This opinion was adopted and popularized by 11th-century scholar Rashi. Possible justifications for this opinion include the fact that Keturah is referred to as Abraham&#x27;s concubine (in the singular), and several other verses which suggest that the descendants of Hagar and Keturah lived in the same territory or formed a single ethnic group. However, this idea was rejected by another rabbi in Genesis Rabbah, as well as by traditional commentators such as Ibn Ezra, Nahmanides, and Rashbam. The Book of Jubilees also supports the conclusion that Keturah and Hagar were two different people, by stating that Abraham waited until after Sarah&#x27;s death before marrying Keturah. According to modern scholar Richard Elliott Friedman, the identification of Keturah with Hagar has &quot;no basis ... in the text&quot;.

Genesis Rabbah interprets the name Keturah in accordance with the opinion that she was identical to Hagar: the name was said to be related to the Aramaic &quot;ketur&quot; (knot) to imply that she was &quot;bound&quot; and did not have sexual relations with anyone else from the time she left Abraham until her return. The name Keturah was alternatively said to be derived from the &quot;ketoret&quot; (meaning &quot;incense&quot; in Hebrew).

== Descendants ==
Keturah bore Abraham six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. Genesis and First Chronicles also list seven of her grandsons (Sheba, Dedan, Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah). Genesis records that Abraham gave them gifts and sent them to the East, while making Isaac son of Sarah his primary heir. Keturah&#x27;s sons were said to have represented the Arab tribes who lived south and east of Israel (). According to the Judean authors Josephus and Malchus, Punic people were descended from Epher.

According to the African (Igbo) writer Olaudah Equiano, the 18th-century English theologian John Gill believed the African people were descended from Abraham and Keturah. According to the Baháʼí author John Able, Baháʼís consider their founder, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, to have been &quot;descended doubly, from both Abraham and Sarah, and separately from Abraham and Keturah.&quot;

* Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (820 CE)

The first book on the systematic algebraic solutions of linear and quadratic equations by the Persian scholar Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī. The book is considered to be the foundation of modern algebra and Islamic mathematics. The word &quot;algebra&quot; itself is derived from the &quot;al-Jabr&quot; in the title of the book.

===&quot;Līlāvatī&quot;, &quot;Siddhānta Shiromani&quot; and &quot;Bijaganita&quot;===

Also known as Elements of Algebra, Euler&#x27;s textbook on elementary algebra is one of the first to set out algebra in the modern form we would recognize today. The first volume deals with determinate equations, while the second part deals with Diophantine equations. The last section contains a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for the case &quot;n&quot; = 3, making some valid assumptions regarding formula_1 that Euler did not prove.

====&quot;Demonstratio nova theorematis omnem functionem algebraicam rationalem integram unius variabilis in factores reales primi vel secundi gradus resolvi posse&quot;====

* Carl Friedrich Gauss (1799)

===Abstract algebra===

====Group theory====

=====&quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot;=====
*Joseph Louis Lagrange (1770)
The title means &quot;Reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations&quot;. Made the prescient observation that the roots of the Lagrange resolvent of a polynomial equation are tied to permutations of the roots of the original equation, laying a more general foundation for what had previously been an ad hoc analysis and helping motivate the later development of the theory of permutation groups, group theory, and Galois theory. The Lagrange resolvent also introduced the discrete Fourier transform of order 3.

====&quot;Articles Publiés par Galois dans les Annales de Mathématiques&quot;====

* Journal de Mathematiques pures et Appliquées, II (1846)
Posthumous publication of the mathematical manuscripts of Évariste Galois by Joseph Liouville. Included are Galois&#x27; papers &quot;Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux&quot; and &quot;Des équations primitives qui sont solubles par radicaux&quot;.

====&quot;Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques&quot;====

*Camille Jordan (1870)
Online version: Online version

Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques (Treatise on Substitutions and Algebraic Equations). The first book on group theory, giving a then-comprehensive study of permutation groups and Galois theory. In this book, Jordan introduced the notion of a simple group and epimorphism (which he called &quot;l&#x27;isomorphisme mériédrique&quot;), proved part of the Jordan–Hölder theorem, and discussed matrix groups over finite fields as well as the Jordan normal form.

====&quot;Theorie der Transformationsgruppen&quot;====

*Sophus Lie, Friedrich Engel (1888–1893).

Publication data: 3 volumes, B.G. Teubner, Verlagsgesellschaft, mbH, Leipzig, 1888–1893. Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3.

The first comprehensive work on transformation groups, serving as the foundation for the modern theory of Lie groups.

====&quot;Solvability of groups of odd order&quot;====

*Walter Feit and John Thompson (1960)
Description: Gave a complete proof of the solvability of finite groups of odd order, establishing the long-standing Burnside conjecture that all finite non-abelian simple groups are of even order. Many of the original techniques used in this paper were used in the eventual classification of finite simple groups.

====Homological algebra====

====&quot;Homological Algebra&quot;====

* Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg (1956)
Provided the first fully worked out treatment of abstract homological algebra, unifying previously disparate presentations of homology and cohomology for associative algebras, Lie algebras, and groups into a single theory.

====&quot;Sur Quelques Points d&#x27;Algèbre Homologique&quot;====

* Alexander Grothendieck (1957)
Often referred to as the &quot;Tôhoku paper&quot;, it revolutionized homological algebra by introducing abelian categories and providing a general framework for Cartan and Eilenberg&#x27;s notion of derived functors.

==Algebraic geometry==

===&quot;Theorie der Abelschen Functionen&quot;===

* Bernhard Riemann (1857)
Publication data: &quot;Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik&quot;

Developed the concept of Riemann surfaces and their topological properties beyond Riemann&#x27;s 1851 thesis work, proved an index theorem for the genus (the original formulation of the Riemann–Hurwitz formula), proved the Riemann inequality for the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles (the original formulation of the Riemann–Roch theorem), discussed birational transformations of a given curve and the dimension of the corresponding moduli space of inequivalent curves of a given genus, and solved more general inversion problems than those investigated by Abel and Jacobi. André Weil once wrote that this paper &quot;is one of the greatest pieces of mathematics that has ever been written; there is not a single word in it that is not of consequence.&quot;

===&quot;Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents&quot;===

* Jean-Pierre Serre
Publication data: &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;, 1955

&quot;FAC&quot;, as it is usually called, was foundational for the use of sheaves in algebraic geometry, extending beyond the case of complex manifolds. Serre introduced Čech cohomology of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry. For example, the long exact sequence in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group. The dimension of a vector space of sections of a coherent sheaf is finite, in projective geometry, and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example Hodge numbers. While Grothendieck&#x27;s derived functor cohomology has replaced Čech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by Čech techniques, and for this reason Serre&#x27;s paper remains important.

===&quot;Géométrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique&quot;===

* Jean-Pierre Serre (1956)
In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are closely related subjects, where &quot;analytic geometry&quot; is the theory of complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from Hodge theory. (&quot;NB&quot; While analytic geometry as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was &quot;Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique&quot; by Serre, now usually referred to as &quot;GAGA&quot;. A &quot;GAGA-style result&quot; would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

===&quot;Le théorème de Riemann–Roch, d&#x27;après A. Grothendieck&quot;===

* Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre (1958)
Borel and Serre&#x27;s exposition of Grothendieck&#x27;s version of the Riemann–Roch theorem, published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result. Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that Hirzebruch proved in 1953 in the framework of morphisms between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization. In his proof, Grothendieck broke new ground with his concept of Grothendieck groups, which led to the development of K-theory.

===&quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot;===

* Alexander Grothendieck (1960–1967)
Written with the assistance of Jean Dieudonné, this is Grothendieck&#x27;s exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry. It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry. The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.

===&quot;Séminaire de géométrie algébrique&quot;===

* Alexander Grothendieck et al.
These seminar notes on Grothendieck&#x27;s reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at IHÉS starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960–1961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck&#x27;s seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is Pierre Deligne&#x27;s proof of the last of the open Weil conjectures in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include Michel Raynaud, Michael Artin, Jean-Pierre Serre, Jean-Louis Verdier, Pierre Deligne, and Nicholas Katz.

==Number theory==

===&quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;===

*Brahmagupta (628)
Brahmagupta&#x27;s Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers.

===&quot;De fractionibus continuis dissertatio&quot;===

*Leonhard Euler (1744)
First presented in 1737, this paper provided the first then-comprehensive account of the properties of continued fractions. It also contains the first proof that the number e is irrational.

===&quot;Recherches d&#x27;Arithmétique&quot;===

*Joseph Louis Lagrange (1775)
Developed a general theory of binary quadratic forms to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form formula_2. This included a reduction theory for binary quadratic forms, where he proved that every form is equivalent to a certain canonically chosen reduced form.

===&quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;===

*Carl Friedrich Gauss (1801)
The &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; is a profound and masterful book on number theory written by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre and adds many important new results of his own. Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the first two published proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, a deep investigation of binary quadratic forms going beyond Lagrange&#x27;s work in &quot;Recherches d&#x27;Arithmétique&quot;, a first appearance of Gauss sums, cyclotomy, and the theory of constructible polygons with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular 17-gon. Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of class numbers of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had conjectured. In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the Hasse–Weil theorem).

===&quot;Beweis des Satzes, daß jede unbegrenzte arithmetische Progression, deren erstes Glied und Differenz ganze Zahlen ohne gemeinschaftlichen Factor sind, unendlich viele Primzahlen enthält&quot;===

*Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1837)
Pioneering paper in analytic number theory, which introduced Dirichlet characters and their L-functions to establish Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions. In subsequent publications, Dirichlet used these tools to determine, among other things, the class number for quadratic forms.

===&quot;Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse&quot;===

*Bernhard Riemann (1859)
&quot;Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse&quot; (or &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;) is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the &quot;Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy&quot;. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern analytic number theory. It also contains the famous Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in mathematics.

===&quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot;===

* Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind
&quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot; (&quot;Lectures on Number Theory&quot;) is a textbook of number theory written by German mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863.
The &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of Fermat, Jacobi and Gauss, and the modern number theory of Dedekind, Riemann and Hilbert. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the group that is central to modern algebra, but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory.

===&quot;Zahlbericht&quot;===
* David Hilbert (1897)
Unified and made accessible many of the developments in algebraic number theory made during the nineteenth century. Although criticized by André Weil (who stated &quot;more than half of his famous Zahlbericht is little more than an account of Kummer&#x27;s number-theoretical work, with inessential improvements&quot;) and Emmy Noether, it was highly influential for many years following its publication.

===&quot;Fourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke&#x27;s Zeta-Functions&quot;===

* John Tate (1950)
Generally referred to simply as &quot;Tate&#x27;s Thesis&quot;, Tate&#x27;s Princeton PhD thesis, under Emil Artin, is a reworking of Erich Hecke&#x27;s theory of zeta- and &quot;L&quot;-functions in terms of Fourier analysis on the adeles. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke&#x27;s results to more general &quot;L&quot;-functions such as those arising from automorphic forms.

===&quot;Automorphic Forms on GL(2)&quot;===

* Hervé Jacquet and Robert Langlands (1970)
This publication offers evidence towards Langlands&#x27; conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of modular forms and their &quot;L&quot;-functions through the introduction of representation theory.

===&quot;La conjecture de Weil. I.&quot;===

* Pierre Deligne (1974)
Proved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open Weil conjectures.

===&quot;Endlichkeitssätze für abelsche Varietäten über Zahlkörpern&quot;===

* Gerd Faltings (1983)
Faltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the Mordell conjecture (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the Tate conjecture (relating the homomorphisms between two abelian varieties over a number field to the homomorphisms between their Tate modules) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.

===&quot;Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot;===

* Andrew Wiles (1995)
This article proceeds to prove a special case of the Shimura–Taniyama conjecture through the study of the deformation theory of Galois representations. This in turn implies the famed Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The proof&#x27;s method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an &quot;R=T&quot; theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.

===&quot;The geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties&quot;===

* Michael Harris and Richard Taylor (2001)
Harris and Taylor provide the first proof of the local Langlands conjecture for GL(&quot;n&quot;). As part of the proof, this monograph also makes an in depth study of the geometry and cohomology of certain Shimura varieties at primes of bad reduction.

===&quot;Le lemme fondamental pour les algèbres de Lie&quot;===

* Ngô Bảo Châu (2008)
Ngô Bảo Châu proved a long-standing unsolved problem in the classical Langlands program, using methods from the Geometric Langlands program.

===&quot;Perfectoid space&quot;===

* Peter Scholze (2012)

Peter Scholze introduced Perfectoid space.

==Analysis==

===&quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot;===

* Leonhard Euler (1748)
The eminent historian of mathematics Carl Boyer once called Euler&#x27;s &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot; the greatest modern textbook in mathematics. Published in two volumes, this book more than any other work succeeded in establishing analysis as a major branch of mathematics, with a focus and approach distinct from that used in geometry and algebra. Notably, Euler identified functions rather than curves to be the central focus in his book. Logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, and transcendental functions were covered, as were expansions into partial fractions, evaluations of for a positive integer between 1 and 13, infinite series and infinite product formulas, continued fractions, and partitions of integers. In this work, Euler proved that every rational number can be written as a finite continued fraction, that the continued fraction of an irrational number is infinite, and derived continued fraction expansions for and formula_3. This work also contains a statement of Euler&#x27;s formula and a statement of the pentagonal number theorem, which he had discovered earlier and would publish a proof for in 1751.

====&quot;Yuktibhāṣā&quot;====

*Jyeshtadeva (1501)
Written in India in 1530,
 and served as a summary of the Kerala School&#x27;s achievements in infinite series, trigonometry and mathematical analysis, most of which were earlier discovered by the 14th century mathematician Madhava. Some of its important developments in calculus include infinite series and Taylor series expansion of some trigonometry functions.

===Calculus===

====&quot;Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quae nec fractas nec irrationales quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illi calculi genus&quot;====

*Gottfried Leibniz (1684)
Leibniz&#x27;s first publication on differential calculus, containing the now familiar notation for differentials as well as rules for computing the derivatives of powers, products and quotients.

====&quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;====

*Isaac Newton (1687)
The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin: &quot;mathematical principles of natural philosophy&quot;, often &quot;Principia&quot; or &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; for short) is a three-volume work by Isaac Newton published on 5 July 1687. Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion forming the foundation of classical mechanics as well as his law of universal gravitation, and derives Kepler&#x27;s laws for the motion of the planets (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena. In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus. When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments.

====&quot;Institutiones calculi differentialis cum eius usu in analysi finitorum ac doctrina serierum&quot;====
*Leonhard Euler (1755)
Published in two books, Euler&#x27;s textbook on differential calculus presented the subject in terms of the function concept, which he had introduced in his 1748 &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot;. This work opens with a study of the calculus of finite differences and makes a thorough investigation of how differentiation behaves under substitutions. Also included is a systematic study of Bernoulli polynomials and the Bernoulli numbers (naming them as such), a demonstration of how the Bernoulli numbers are related to the coefficients in the Euler–Maclaurin formula and the values of ζ(2n), a further study of Euler&#x27;s constant (including its connection to the gamma function), and an application of partial fractions to differentiation.

====&quot;Über die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe&quot;====

*Bernhard Riemann (1867)
Written in 1853, Riemann&#x27;s work on trigonometric series was published posthumously. In it, he extended Cauchy&#x27;s definition of the integral to that of the Riemann integral, allowing some functions with dense subsets of discontinuities on an interval to be integrated (which he demonstrated by an example). He also stated the Riemann series theorem, proved the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma for the case of bounded Riemann integrable functions, and developed the Riemann localization principle.

====&quot;Intégrale, longueur, aire&quot;====

*Henri Lebesgue (1901)

Lebesgue&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, summarizing and extending his research to date regarding his development of measure theory and the Lebesgue integral.

===Complex analysis===

====&quot;Grundlagen für eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer veränderlichen complexen Grösse&quot;====

* Bernhard Riemann (1851)

Riemann&#x27;s doctoral dissertation introduced the notion of a Riemann surface, conformal mapping, simple connectivity, the Riemann sphere, the Laurent series expansion for functions having poles and branch points, and the Riemann mapping theorem.

===Functional analysis===

====&quot;Théorie des opérations linéaires&quot; ====

* Stefan Banach (1932; originally published 1931 in Polish under the title &quot;Teorja operacyj&quot;.)

The first mathematical monograph on the subject of linear metric spaces, bringing the abstract study of functional analysis to the wider mathematical community. The book introduced the ideas of a normed space and the notion of a so-called &quot;B&quot;-space, a complete normed space. The &quot;B&quot;-spaces are now called Banach spaces and are one of the basic objects of study in all areas of modern mathematical analysis. Banach also gave proofs of versions of the open mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, and Hahn–Banach theorem.

====&quot;Produits Tensoriels Topologiques et Espaces Nucléaires&quot;====

Grothendieck&#x27;s thesis introduced the notion of a nuclear space, tensor products of locally convex topological vector spaces, and the start of Grothendieck&#x27;s work on tensor products of Banach spaces.

Alexander Grothendieck also wrote a textbook on topological vector spaces:

====&quot;Sur certains espaces vectoriels topologiques&quot;====

===Fourier analysis===

====&quot;Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides&quot;====

* Joseph Fourier (1807)

Introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Key contribution was to not simply use trigonometric series, but to model &quot;all&quot; functions by trigonometric series:

When Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: &quot;...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...] his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour&quot;. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the Dirichlet integral and later the Lebesgue integral.

====&quot;Sur la convergence des séries trigonométriques qui servent à représenter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites données&quot;====

* Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1829, expanded German edition in 1837)

In his habilitation thesis on Fourier series, Riemann characterized this work of Dirichlet as &quot;the first profound paper about the subject&quot;. This paper gave the first rigorous proof of the convergence of Fourier series under fairly general conditions (piecewise continuity and monotonicity) by considering partial sums, which Dirichlet transformed into a particular Dirichlet integral involving what is now called the Dirichlet kernel. This paper introduced the nowhere continuous Dirichlet function and an early version of the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma.

====&quot;On convergence and growth of partial sums of Fourier series&quot;====

* Lennart Carleson (1966)

Settled Lusin&#x27;s conjecture that the Fourier expansion of any formula_4 function converges almost everywhere.

==Geometry==
===&quot;Baudhayana Sulba Sutra&quot;===

* Baudhayana
Believed to have been written around the 8th century BCE, this is one of the oldest mathematical texts. It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia . Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, geometric solutions of linear equations, the use of quadratic equations and square root of 2.

===&quot;Euclid&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Elements&quot;===

* Euclid
Publication data: c. 300 BC

Online version: Interactive Java version

This is often regarded as not only the most important work in geometry but one of the most important works in mathematics. It contains many important results in plane and solid geometry, algebra (books II and V), and number theory (book VII, VIII, and IX). More than any specific result in the publication, it seems that the major achievement of this publication is the promotion of an axiomatic approach as a means for proving results. Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.

===&quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;===

* Unknown author
This was a Chinese mathematics book, mostly geometric, composed during the Han dynasty, perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in China and East Asia for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the &quot;rule of false position&quot;. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to Gaussian elimination. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the Pythagorean theorem. The earliest solution of a matrix using a method equivalent to the modern method.

===&quot;The Conics&quot;===

* Apollonius of Perga
The Conics was written by Apollonius of Perga, a Greek mathematician. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemy, Francesco Maurolico, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes. It was Apollonius who gave the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola the names by which we know them.

===&quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;===

* Unknown (400 CE)
It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or &quot;perpendicular sine&quot;) and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time . Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.

===&quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;===

*Aryabhata (499 CE)
This was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth&#x27;s circumference.

===&quot;La Géométrie&quot;===

* René Descartes
La Géométrie was published in 1637 and written by René Descartes. The book was influential in developing the Cartesian coordinate system and specifically discussed the representation of points of a plane, via real numbers; and the representation of curves, via equations.

===&quot;Grundlagen der Geometrie&quot;===

*David Hilbert
Online version: English

Publication data: 

Hilbert&#x27;s axiomatization of geometry, whose primary influence was in its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions including the use of models to prove axiom independence and the importance of establishing the consistency and completeness of an axiomatic system.

===&quot;Regular Polytopes&quot;===

* H.S.M. Coxeter
&quot;Regular Polytopes&quot; is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of regular polytopes, the generalisation of regular polygons and regular polyhedra to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled &quot;Dimensional Analogy&quot; written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.

===Differential geometry===

====&quot;Recherches sur la courbure des surfaces&quot;====

* Leonhard Euler (1760)
Publication data: Mémoires de l&#x27;académie des sciences de Berlin 16 (1760) pp. 119–143; published 1767. (Full text and an English translation available from the Dartmouth Euler archive.)

Established the theory of surfaces, and introduced the idea of principal curvatures, laying the foundation for subsequent developments in the differential geometry of surfaces.

====&quot;Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas&quot;====

* Carl Friedrich Gauss (1827)
Publication data: &quot;Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas&quot;, &quot;Commentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingesis Recentiores&quot; Vol. VI (1827), pp. 99–146; &quot;General Investigations of Curved Surfaces&quot; (published 1965) Raven Press, New York, translated by A.M.Hiltebeitel and J.C.Morehead.

Groundbreaking work in differential geometry, introducing the notion of Gaussian curvature and Gauss&#x27;s celebrated Theorema Egregium.

====&quot;Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde Liegen&quot;====

* Bernhard Riemann (1854)
Publication data: &quot;Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde Liegen&quot;, &quot;Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen&quot;, Vol. 13, 1867. English translation

Riemann&#x27;s famous Habiltationsvortrag, in which he introduced the notions of a manifold, Riemannian metric, and curvature tensor. Richard Dedekind reported on the reaction of the then 77 year old Gauss to Riemann&#x27;s presentation, stating that it had &quot;surpassed all his expectations&quot; and that he spoke &quot;with the greatest appreciation, and with an excitement rare for him, about the depth of the ideas presented by Riemann.&quot;

====&quot;Leçons sur la théorie génerale des surfaces et les applications géométriques du calcul infinitésimal&quot;====

*Gaston Darboux
Publication data: Volume I, Volume II, Volume III, Volume IV

Leçons sur la théorie génerale des surfaces et les applications géométriques du calcul infinitésimal (on the General Theory of Surfaces and the Geometric Applications of Infinitesimal Calculus). A treatise covering virtually every aspect of the 19th century differential geometry of surfaces.

==Topology==

===&quot;Analysis situs&quot;===

* Henri Poincaré (1895, 1899–1905)
Description: Poincaré&#x27;s Analysis Situs and his Compléments à l&#x27;Analysis Situs laid the general foundations for algebraic topology. In these papers, Poincaré introduced the notions of homology and the fundamental group, provided an early formulation of Poincaré duality, gave the Euler–Poincaré characteristic for chain complexes, and mentioned several important conjectures including the Poincaré conjecture, demonstrated by Grigori Perelman in 2003.

===&quot;L&#x27;anneau d&#x27;homologie d&#x27;une représentation&quot;, &quot;Structure de l&#x27;anneau d&#x27;homologie d&#x27;une représentation&quot;===

* Jean Leray (1946)
These two Comptes Rendus notes of Leray from 1946 introduced the novel concepts of sheafs, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences, which he had developed during his years of captivity as a prisoner of war. Leray&#x27;s announcements and applications (published in other Comptes Rendus notes from 1946) drew immediate attention from other mathematicians. Subsequent clarification, development, and generalization by Henri Cartan, Jean-Louis Koszul, Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Leray himself allowed these concepts to be understood and applied to many other areas of mathematics. Dieudonné would later write that these notions created by Leray &quot;undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the methods invented by Poincaré and Brouwer&quot;.

===Quelques propriétés globales des variétés differentiables===

*René Thom (1954)
In this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of oriented and unoriented cobordism, and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces. Thom completely characterized the unoriented cobordism ring and achieved strong results for several problems, including Steenrod&#x27;s problem on the realization of cycles.

==Category theory==

===&quot;General Theory of Natural Equivalences&quot;===

* Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane (1945)
The first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in &quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician&quot; that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, &quot;natural&quot; was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, &quot;natural&quot; had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.

===&quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician&quot;===

* Saunders Mac Lane (1971, second edition 1998)
Saunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses. Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as adjoint functors and universal properties.

===&quot;Higher Topos Theory&quot;===
* Jacob Lurie (2010)
&quot;This purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of &quot;quasicategories&quot; or &quot;weak Kan complexes&quot;), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included.&quot; (see arXiv.)

==Set theory==

===&quot;Über eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen&quot;===

* Georg Cantor (1874)
Online version: Online version

Contains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See Georg Cantor&#x27;s first set theory article.)

===&quot;Grundzüge der Mengenlehre&quot;===

* Felix Hausdorff
First published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on measure theory and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.

===&quot;The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory&quot;===

* Kurt Gödel (1938)
Gödel proves the results of the title. Also, in the process, introduces the class L of constructible sets, a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.

===&quot;The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis&quot;===

* Paul J. Cohen (1963, 1964)
Cohen&#x27;s breakthrough work proved the independence of the continuum hypothesis and axiom of choice with respect to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of &quot;forcing&quot; which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.

==Logic==

===&quot;The Laws of Thought&quot;===

* George Boole (1854)
Published in 1854, The Laws of Thought was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re-expression and extension of Aristotle&#x27;s logic in the language of mathematics. Boole&#x27;s work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for Claude Shannon in the development of digital logic.

===&quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;===

* Gottlob Frege (1879)
Published in 1879, the title Begriffsschrift is usually translated as &quot;concept writing&quot; or &quot;concept notation&quot;; the full title of the book identifies it as &quot;a formula language, modelled on that of arithmetic, of pure thought&quot;. Frege&#x27;s motivation for developing his formal logical system was similar to Leibniz&#x27;s desire for a &quot;calculus ratiocinator&quot;. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the foundations of mathematics. Begriffsschrift is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein. It was arguably the most significant publication in logic since Aristotle.

===&quot;Formulario mathematico&quot;===

* Giuseppe Peano (1895)
First published in 1895, the Formulario mathematico was the first mathematical book written entirely in a formalized language. It contained a description of mathematical logic and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.

===&quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;===

* Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead (1910–1913)
The Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published in 1910–1913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia&#x27;s axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem in 1931.

===&quot;Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I&quot;===

(On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems)
* Kurt Gödel (1931)
Online version: Online version

In mathematical logic, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems are two celebrated theorems proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931.
The first incompleteness theorem states:
For any formal system such that (1) it is formula_5-consistent (omega-consistent), (2) it has a recursively definable set of axioms and rules of derivation, and (3) every recursive relation of natural numbers is definable in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural numbers and yet it is not a theorem of the system.
===&quot;Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals&quot;===

* Alan Turing&#x27;s PhD thesis (1938)

==Combinatorics==

===&quot;On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression&quot;===

*Endre Szemerédi (1975)
Settled a conjecture of Paul Erdős and Pál Turán (now known as Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Szemerédi&#x27;s solution has been described as a &quot;masterpiece of combinatorics&quot; and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the Szemerédi regularity lemma.

===Graph theory===

====&quot;Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis&quot;====

* Leonhard Euler (1741)
* Euler&#x27;s original publication (in Latin)
Euler&#x27;s solution of the Königsberg bridge problem in &quot;Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis&quot; (&quot;The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position&quot;) is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.

====&quot;On the evolution of random graphs&quot;====

*Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi (1960)
Provides a detailed discussion of sparse random graphs, including distribution of components, occurrence of small subgraphs, and phase transitions.

====&quot;Network Flows and General Matchings&quot;====

* L. R. Ford, Jr. &amp; D. R. Fulkerson
* &quot;Flows in Networks&quot;. Prentice-Hall, 1962.
Presents the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem, along with many ideas on flow-based models.

&quot;See list of important publications in statistics.&quot;

==Game theory==

===&quot;Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele&quot;===

* John von Neumann (1928)
Went well beyond Émile Borel&#x27;s initial investigations into strategic two-person game theory by proving the minimax theorem for two-person, zero-sum games.

===&quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot;===

* Oskar Morgenstern, John von Neumann (1944)
This book led to the investigation of modern game theory as a prominent branch of mathematics. This work contained the method for finding optimal solutions for two-person zero-sum games.

===&quot;Equilibrium Points in N-person Games&quot;===
Nash equilibrium

===&quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;===

*John Horton Conway (1976)
The book is in two, {0,1|}, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games – both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as Nim, Hackenbush, Col and Snort amongst the many described.

===&quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;===

*Elwyn Berlekamp, John Conway and Richard K. Guy (1982)
A compendium of information on mathematical games. It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on Combinatorial game theory and surreal numbers, and the other concentrating on a number of specific games.

==Information theory==

===&quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;===

*Claude Shannon (1948)
An article, later expanded into a book, which developed the concepts of information entropy and redundancy, and introduced the term bit (which Shannon credited to John Tukey) as a unit of information.

==Fractals==

===&quot;How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension&quot;===

*Benoît Mandelbrot (1967)
A discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975.
Shows Mandelbrot&#x27;s early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.

==Numerical analysis==

===Optimization===

====&quot;Method of Fluxions&quot;====

* Isaac Newton (1736)
&quot;Method of Fluxions&quot; was a book written by Isaac Newton. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736. Within this book, Newton describes a method (the Newton–Raphson method) for finding the real zeroes of a function.

====&quot;Essai d&#x27;une nouvelle méthode pour déterminer les maxima et les minima des formules intégrales indéfinies&quot;====

* Joseph Louis Lagrange (1761)
Major early work on the calculus of variations, building upon some of Lagrange&#x27;s prior investigations as well as those of Euler. Contains investigations of minimal surface determination as well as the initial appearance of Lagrange multipliers.

====&quot;Математические методы организации и планирования производства&quot;====

* Leonid Kantorovich (1939) &quot;[The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization]&quot; (in Russian).
Kantorovich wrote the first paper on production planning, which used Linear Programs as the model. He received the Nobel prize for this work in 1975.

====&quot;Decomposition Principle for Linear Programs&quot;====

* George Dantzig and P. Wolfe
* Operations Research 8:101–111, 1960.
Dantzig&#x27;s is considered the father of linear programming in the western world. He independently invented the simplex algorithm. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large-scale linear programs in factory and production planning.

====&quot;How Good is the Simplex Algorithm?&quot;====

* Victor Klee and George J. Minty
Klee and Minty gave an example showing that the simplex algorithm can take exponentially many steps to solve a linear program.

====&quot;Полиномиальный алгоритм в линейном программировании&quot;====
Khachiyan&#x27;s work on the ellipsoid method. This was the first polynomial time algorithm for linear programming.

==Early manuscripts==
These are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the history of mathematics.

===&quot;Moscow Mathematical Papyrus&quot;===

This is one of the earliest mathematical treatises that still survives today. The Papyrus contains 25 problems involving arithmetic, geometry, and algebra, each with a solution given. Written in Ancient Egypt at approximately 1850 BC.

===&quot;Rhind Mathematical Papyrus&quot;===

* Ahmes (scribe)

One of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt. It was copied by the scribe Ahmes (properly &quot;Ahmose&quot;) from an older Middle Kingdom papyrus. It laid the foundations of Egyptian mathematics and in turn, later influenced Greek and Hellenistic mathematics. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of π only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at squaring the circle and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the Egyptians deliberately built their pyramids to enshrine the value of π in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the cotangent.

===&quot;Archimedes Palimpsest&quot;===

*Archimedes of Syracuse
Although the only mathematical tools at its author&#x27;s disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school geometry, he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using infinitesimals to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus. Among those problems were that of the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines. For explicit details of the method used, see Archimedes&#x27; use of infinitesimals.

===&quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;===

*Archimedes of Syracuse

Online version: Online version

The first known (European) system of number-naming that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life.

==Textbooks==

===&quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;===

* David Dummit and Richard Foote

&quot;Dummit and Foote&quot; has become the modern dominant abstract algebra textbook following Jacobson&#x27;s Basic Algebra.

===&quot;Arithmetika Horvatzka&quot;===

* Mihalj Šilobod Bolšić

&quot;Arithmetika Horvatzka&quot; (1758) was the first Croatian language arithmetic textbook, written in the vernacular Kajkavian dialect of Croatian language. It established a complete system of arithmetic terminology in Croatian, and vividly used examples from everyday life in Croatia to present mathematical operations. Although it was clear that Šilobod had made use of words that were in dictionaries, this was clearly insufficient for his purposes; and he made up some names by adapting Latin terminology to Kaikavian use. Full text of &quot;Arithmetika Horvatszka&quot; is available via archive.org.

===&quot;Synopsis of Pure Mathematics&quot;===

* G. S. Carr
Contains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training his students for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Studied extensively by Ramanujan. (first half here)

===&quot;Éléments de mathématique&quot;===

* Nicolas Bourbaki
One of the most influential books in French mathematical literature. It introduces some of the notations and definitions that are now usual (the symbol ∅ or the term bijective for example). Characterized by an extreme level of rigour, formalism and generality (up to the point of being highly criticized for that), its publication started in 1939 and is still unfinished today.

* Robert Recorde
Written in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language.

===&quot;Cocker&#x27;s Arithmetick&quot;===

* Edward Cocker (authorship disputed)
Textbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676. This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years.

===&quot;The Schoolmaster&#x27;s Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical&quot;===

* Thomas Dilworth
An early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in America in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections.

===&quot;Geometry&quot;===

*Andrei Kiselyov
Publication data: 1892

The most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page.)

===&quot;A Course of Pure Mathematics&quot;===

* G. H. Hardy

A classic textbook in introductory mathematical analysis, written by G. H. Hardy. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge, and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge. As such, it was aimed directly at &quot;scholarship level&quot; students – the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory calculus and the theory of infinite series.

===&quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;===

* B. L. van der Waerden
The first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether. First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag. A later English translation was published in 1949 by Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.

===&quot;Algebra&quot;===

* Saunders Mac Lane and Garrett Birkhoff
A definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a category theoretic approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.

===&quot;Calculus, Vol. 1&quot;===

* Tom M. Apostol

===&quot;Algebraic Geometry&quot;===

* Robin Hartshorne
The first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology. Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the functor of points.

===&quot;Naive Set Theory&quot;===

* Paul Halmos
An undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades. It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners. While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects. Where it differs from a &quot;true&quot; axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like large cardinals. Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

===&quot;Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers&quot;===

* Wacław Sierpiński
The &quot;nec plus ultra&quot; reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers. If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author&#x27;s lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.

===&quot;Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs&quot;===

* Kenneth Kunen
This book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to forcing. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, &quot;Set Theory&quot;. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin&#x27;s axiom.

===&quot;Topologie&quot;===

* Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov
* Heinz Hopf
First published round 1935, this text was a pioneering &quot;reference&quot; text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.

===&quot;General Topology&quot;===

* John L. Kelley
First published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.

===&quot;Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint&quot;===

* John Milnor
This short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor&#x27;s lucid and concise style. While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.

===&quot;Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre&quot;===

* André Weil
An historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest researchers in the field. The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre. The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.

===&quot;An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers&quot;===

* G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright
&quot;An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers&quot; was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.

===&quot;Foundations of Differential Geometry&quot;===

==Handbooks==

===&quot;Bronshtein and Semendyayev&quot;===

* Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein and Konstantin Adolfovic Semendyayev

&quot;Bronshtein and Semendyayev&quot; is the informal name of a comprehensive handbook of fundamental working knowledge of mathematics and table of formulas originally compiled by the Russian mathematician Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein and engineer Konstantin Adolfovic Semendyayev. The work was first published in 1945 in Russia and soon became a &quot;standard&quot; and frequently used guide for scientists, engineers, and technical university students. It has been translated into German, English, and many other languages. The latest edition was published in 2015 by Springer.

===&quot;CRC Standard Mathematical Tables&quot;===

* Editors-in-chief: Charles D. Hodgman (14th edition and earlier); Samuel M. Selby (15th–23rd editions); William H. Beyer (24th–29th editions); Daniel Zwillinger (30th–33rd editions)

&quot;CRC Standard Mathematical Tables&quot; is a comprehensive one-volume handbook of fundamental working knowledge of mathematics and table of formulas. The handbook was originally published in 1928. The latest edition was published in 2018 by CRC Press, with Daniel Zwillinger as the editor-in-chief.

==Popular writings==

===&quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;===

* Douglas Hofstadter
&quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid&quot; is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.
It is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: &quot;I realized that to me, Gödel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book.&quot;

===&quot;The World of Mathematics&quot;===

* James R. Newman
&quot;The World of Mathematics&quot; was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincaré, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.

<doc id="708400" wikidata="Q7209701" url="?curid=708400" title="Policy of deliberate ambiguity">
<text>In the context of global politics, a policy of deliberate ambiguity (also known as a policy of strategic ambiguity or strategic uncertainty) is the practice by a government or non-state actor of being deliberately ambiguous with regard to all or certain aspects of its operational or positional policies. This is typically a way to avoid direct conflict while maintaining a masked more assertive or threatening position on a subject (broadly, a geopolitical risk aversion strategy).

== Examples of geopolitical ambiguity ==

=== China ===
Currently, two governments claim legitimate rule and sovereignty over all of China, which they claim includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, as well as some other islands. The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) rules Mainland China under a one-party system and Hong Kong and Macau as special administrative regions, while the Republic of China (ROC) governs the Island of Taiwan as well as the Kinmen Islands, the Pescadores Islands and the Matsu Islands, which the ROC collectively refers to as the &quot;Free area of the Republic of China&quot;. For further background, see Two Chinas, One-China policy and Cross-Strait relations.

Owing to the controversial political status of Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s One-China policy, foreign governments have felt a need to be ambiguous regarding Taiwan. The PRC pressures states to recognize it as the sole legitimate representative of China, with which most states comply. In practice, however, most states maintain different levels of ambiguity on their attitudes to the Taiwan issue: see Foreign relations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Foreign relations of the Republic of China.

Starting with the 1979 Nagoya Resolution and the following 1981 agreement with the International Olympic Committee, those from Taiwan who attend the Olympic Games and other various international organizations and events participate under the deliberately ambiguous name of &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;.

=== India ===
India&#x27;s Draft Nuclear Doctrine of 2003 affirms its policies of &quot;No First Use&quot; and &quot;Credible Minimum Deterrence&quot;, limiting its nuclear weapons posture. In spite of that, senior officials have implied that the country may have expanded their posture to include first-strike capabilities. It is not clear whether this is an instance of deliberate ambiguity or merely discord among Indian leadership.

=== Israel ===
Israel is deliberately ambiguous as to whether or not it possesses nuclear weapons, which its commentators term &quot;nuclear ambiguity&quot; or &quot;nuclear opacity&quot;. It is a general consensus that Israel is in possession of nuclear weapons.

Israel has also practiced deliberate ambiguity over the issue of targeted killings and airstrikes. Prior to 2017, Israel generally neither confirmed nor denied whether Israel was involved in the deaths of suspected terrorists on foreign soil. 

However, with the onset of the Syrian Civil War (and Israel&#x27;s involvement against Iran and Hezbollah), exceptions to its policy became more prominent. Israel actively acknowledged that its intervention in the war has been limited to missile strikes, which until 2017 were not officially acknowledged. Israel has also made rare exceptions to this policy to deny involvement in certain killings in the war.

With regard to notable targeted killings and assassination attempts, Israel has often exhibited a more nuanced approach to policies of intentional ambiguity, as demonstrated by numerous assassination attempts on Mohammed Deif. This example of &#x27;policy opacity&#x27; demonstrates how the approach to a subject can change with time and circumstance.

=== Russia ===
In early April 2015, an editorial in the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;, with a reference to semi-official sources within the Russian military and intelligence establishment, opined that Russia&#x27;s warnings of its alleged preparedness for a nuclear response to certain non-nuclear acts on the part of NATO, were to be construed as &quot;an attempt to create strategic uncertainty&quot; to undermine Western concerted security policy.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom is deliberately ambiguous about whether its ballistic missile submarines would carry out a nuclear counter-attack in the event that the government were destroyed by a nuclear first strike. Upon taking office, the incoming prime minister issues sealed letters of last resort to the commanders of the submarines on what action to take in such circumstances.

=== United States ===
The United States has utilized numerous policies of strategic ambiguity in numerous geopolitical areas.

==== Taiwan issue ====
The United States has numerous ambiguous policies relating to its positions on Taiwan. This issue is at the cornerstone of United States–Taiwan relations and a central sticking point in United States–China relations. This policy was intended to discourage both a unilateral declaration of independence by ROC leaders and an invasion of Taiwan by the PRC. The United States seemingly abandoned strategic ambiguity in 2001 after then-President George W. Bush stated that he would &quot;do whatever it takes&quot; to defend Taiwan. He later used more ambiguous language, stating in 2003 that &quot;The United States policy is one China&quot;.

President Joe Biden has also seemingly abandoned strategic ambiguity, having said on several occasions that the United States would defend Taiwan if it was attacked. After each of these remarks, however, the White House declared that there had been no official change in policy. 

As an example, in October 2021, President Biden announced a commitment that the United States would defend Taiwan if attacked by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. But then the White House quickly clarified: &quot;The president was not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy&quot;. 

In May 2022 Biden again stated that the U.S. would intervene militarily if China invaded Taiwan, though a White House official again stated that the statement did not indicate a policy shift.

==== Response to chemical or biological warfare ====
Another historic use of this policy is whether the United States would retaliate to a chemical or biological attack with nuclear weapons; specifically, during the Persian Gulf War. Related is the notion of a nuclear umbrella. Some commentators believe President Barack Obama broke US policy and damaged U.S. interests by failing to take sufficient action against the regime of Bashar al-Assad for its Ghouta chemical attack on civilians in the village of Ghouta near Damascus on August 21, 2013. President Barack Obama had used the phrase &quot;red line&quot; in reference to the use of chemical weapons on August 20, just one day prior. Specifically, Obama said: &quot;We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.&quot;

==== Nuclear weapons on surface ships ====

Since passing a 1987 law, New Zealand has banned all nuclear powered means of war, whether nuclear weapons or nuclear powered propulsion from its sovereign territory, thereby making it a military nuclear-free zone. New Zealand has not banned civilian nuclear energy, but it is no longer used there and the public is quite opposed, thereby making it a &quot;de facto&quot; nuclear-free country. This ban includes its territorial waters as per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Official U.S. Navy policy is &quot;not to deploy nuclear weapons aboard surface ships, naval aircraft, attack submarines, or guided missile submarines. However, we do not discuss the presence or absence of nuclear weapons aboard specific ships, submarines, or aircraft.” Because the U.S. Navy refuses to confirm whether any particular ship is or is not carrying nuclear weapons, this was an effective ban on the ships&#x27; entry into New Zealand territory. In response, the United States partially suspended New Zealand from the ANZUS military alliance. President Ronald Reagan stated that New Zealand was &quot;a friend, but not an ally&quot;.

==== Nuclear weapons and Israel ====
The United States also tolerates Israel&#x27;s deliberate ambiguity as to whether Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel is not a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Therefore, by not acknowledging that Israel likely has nuclear weapons, the US avoids having to sanction it for violating American anti-proliferation law.

=== Historical examples ===

==== East and West Germany ====
After West Germany gave up its &quot;Hallstein Doctrine&quot; of ending diplomatic relations with any country recognizing East Germany (thus implicitly following a &quot;one-Germany policy&quot;), West Germany turned to a policy of virtually or &quot;de facto&quot; recognizing East Germany in the 1970s, despite still maintaining several policies in accordance with the fictive but &quot;de jure&quot; legal principle of there being only one Germany.

East German citizens were treated as West German citizens upon arrival in West Germany and exports to East Germany were treated as if they were domestic trade. That created a deliberately ambiguous policy that reconciled the demand by the rest of the world for West Germany to acknowledge the existence of East Germany and the desire by the vast majority of West German politicians to avoid recognizing German partition as permanent.

<text>Siedlce is a district (dzielnica) of the city of Gdańsk, Poland, with 17,584 inhabitants (area 2.6 km2).

It includes the area around Kartuska Street, the main road out of Gdańsk towards Kartuzy). Recently, a new dual carriageway, Domestic Army Avenue, was built along the boundary between Siedlce &amp; Chełm. This was built as a bypass to the single-carriageway Kartuska St. for intercity traffic.

==Important buildings==
In Siedlce there is a Neo-Gothic Catholic church, which is the center of the Parish of St Francis of Assisi. It is situated on Ulica Struga. There are also two schools in Siedlce, both close to Kartuska Street.

<text>Erki Nool (born 25 June 1970, in Võru, Estonia) is an Estonian decathlete and former politician.

==Life and career==
Nool grew up in an impoverished environment in the southern part of Võru. His father was a worker in a furniture factory and his mother was in charge of the finances of a school. There were six children, with Erki the third youngest. When he was 13, from the suggestion of his father he moved to a sports-focused boarding school, where he could eat a free warm meal three times a day.

In those days the economy was in a poor condition. When traveling to over-seas competitions, they didn&#x27;t get their own cabin in the cruise ship, but instead just slept in the hallways and then competed and trained the next day. They also didn&#x27;t have indoor athletics training facilities for winter. Nool was brought to tears when he was gifted a new, pristine pair of sneakers. 

After Estonia became independent on 20 August 1991, Nool was vocal about his dream of competing in the Olympics as part of the Estonian team. He took part in the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics decathlon but he ended up having to stop and pull out. Little by little he developed and by the mid-1990s he was among the top athletes in decathlon. In September 1997 he founded his own sports club and in 1998–2009 he organized international decathlon competition &quot;Reval Hotels Cup&quot;.

When he won gold for decathlon at the 1998 Budapest European Championships, he became a sports hero. Two years later, when he won the gold medal for decathlon in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, he became a national hero. Although Nool did not place first in any individual event, his total score was the highest. There was a dramatic moment in discus throw, but luckily the competition referee decided to over-rule a judge, who had red-flagged his last and only valid attempt due to alleged step-out. The reinstatement of his 43.66-metre third throw sparked unsuccessful counter-protests from other teams. Nool took gold ahead of the Czech Roman Šebrle and American Chris Huffins. 

He has been voted as Estonia&#x27;s sexiest man and in the 2000s the most popular Estonian. In 2006, Nool participated as a celebrity contestant on the first season of &quot;Tantsud tähtedega&quot;, an Estonian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. His professional dancing partner was Ave Vardja.

2005–2017, Erki Nool was the Vice Chairman of the EOC Athletes Commission and 2007–2011 member of the European Athletics Development Committee. 2008–2012, he was also member of the executive committee of the Estonian Olympic Committee.

On 4 March 2007, Nool was elected to the Estonian Parliament, the &quot;Riigikogu&quot;, representing the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica. He has since left politics and now focuses on his real estate business and athletics school, with 450 students.

His son Robin Nool (born in 1998) competed in pole vault with a record of 5.40 m.

<text>Zophar ( &quot;Ṣōp̄ar&quot;, &quot;chirping&quot;; &quot;rising early&quot;; also &quot;Tzofar&quot;) the Naamathite is one of the three friends of Job who visit him during his illness in the &quot;Book of Job&quot; (), Hebrew Bible / Old Testament. &quot;Naamathite&quot; (na&#x27;-a-ma-thit) is a Gentile name, suggesting he was from a city called Naamah, perhaps in Arabia. 

Zophar&#x27;s comments can be found in and . He suggests that Job&#x27;s suffering could be divine punishment, and goes into great detail about the consequences of living a life of sin.

==Speeches==
Zophar only speaks twice to Job, unlike friends Bildad and Eliphaz who each give three speeches. Zophar is the most impetuous and dogmatic of Job&#x27;s three visitors:
He is the first to accuse Job directly of wickedness; claiming that Job&#x27;s punishment is indeed too good for him (Job 11:6), and he rebukes Job&#x27;s impious presumption in trying to find out the unsearchable secrets of God (). Despite his dogmatic speech, Zophar promises Job peace and restoration, on condition of penitence and putting away iniquity (), redoubling the promises of Job&#x27;s other visitors.

Zophar&#x27;s second speech is a lecture on the fate of the wicked, ending with a summary appraisal, in the same style as his friend Bildad,
: This is the portion of the wicked, the heritage appointed him by God.

<doc id="708427" wikidata="Q1194621" url="?curid=708427" title="Fraser script">
<text>The Fraser or Old Lisu script is an artificial abugida for the Lisu language invented around 1915 by Sara Ba Thaw, a Karen preacher from Myanmar, and improved by the missionary James O. Fraser. It is a single-case (unicameral) alphabet. It was also used for the Naxi language, e.g. in the 1932 Naxi Gospel of Mark, and used in the Zaiwa or Atsi language, e.g. in the 1938 Atsi Gospel of Mark.

The script uses uppercase letters from the Latin script (except for the letter Q) and rotated versions thereof (except for the letters M, Q and W) to write consonants and vowels. Tones and nasalization are written with Roman punctuation marks, identical to those found on a typewriter. Like the Indic abugidas, the vowel is not written. However, unlike those scripts, the other vowels are written with full letters.

The local Chinese government in Nujiang &quot;de facto&quot; recognized the script in 1992 as the official script for writing in Lisu, although other Lisu autonomous territories continue to use the New Lisu.

==Consonants==
Note: You may need to download a Lisu capable Unicode font if not all characters display.

#Initial glottal stop is only written when the inherent vowel follows, and just like all consonants, the inherent vowel suffix must not be written as that would indicate another follows ( instead of ). It is automatic before all initial vowels but and .
# represents a &quot;vowel&quot; in the Naxi language, presumably a medial , and a consonant in the Lisu language. , and are likewise ambiguous.
# only occurs in an imperative particle. It is an allophone of , which causes nasalization to the syllable.
# , and are used only in Lisu language.
# is used only in Naxi language.

==Vowels==

:**Only written after a syllable (consonant letter) to indicate a second vowel. Other vowels do not have special letters to emphasize a secondary vowel without glottal stop initial, such as () is not written as and can only be distinguished from () by a space.

For example, is , while is . 

When consonant ꓠꓬ, ꓬ is used with vowel ꓬꓱ, ꓬ, without being ambiguous only one ꓬ is written.

When transcribing exotic rimes (diphthongs or nasal endings), letters ꓮ and ꓬ can work like vowels just like English letter Y, making Fraser script behave like an abjadic alphabet like the Roman instead of an abugida like Tibetan; meanwhile space works like a delimiter like a Tibetan tseg, making a final consonant (such as ꓠ) possible without necessity of a halanta sign: 凉粉 reads as rather than as .


==Tones==
Tones are written with standard punctuation. Lisu punctuation therefore differs from international norms: the comma is (hyphen period) and the full stop is (equal sign).
:*It is not clear how the mid tone differs from the unmarked mid tone.
The tones , , , may be combined with and as compound tones. However, the only compound tone still in common use is .

The apostrophe indicates nasalization. It is combined with tone marks.

The understrike (optionally a low macron) indicates the Lisu &quot;A glide&quot;, a contraction of without an intervening glottal stop. The tone is not always falling, depending on the environment, but is written regardless.

==Unicode==
The Fraser script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.

The Unicode block for the Fraser script, called &#x27;Lisu&#x27;, is U+A4D0–U+A4FF:

An additional character, the inverted Y used in the Naxi language, was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2020 with the release of version 13.0. It is in the Lisu Supplement block (U+11FB0–U+11FBF):

<text>The North Yamhill River is a tributary of the Yamhill River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains an area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range, as well as part of the Willamette Valley west of the Willamette River.

Rising in a remote area in the mountains of northwestern Yamhill County, the river flows generally east, then southeast, then south past the city of Yamhill. It joins the South Yamhill River about east of McMinnville to form the Yamhill River.

==Course==
The river begins at an elevation of above sea level and falls between source and mouth to an elevation of . It rises northeast of Trask Mountain, a peak at , in the Northern Oregon Coast Range. The source, at about river mile (RM) 31 or river kilometer (RK) 50, lies near the border between Tillamook County and Yamhill County northwest of the city of Yamhill.

Flowing south and then southeast for its first , the river receives Perkins Creek from the . Heading east, it receives Maroney Creek from the right before reaching the Flying M Ranch and Flying M Airport at about RM 26 (RK 42), where it receives Hanna Creek from the and Petch Creek from the right. Continuing east, the stream receives Fairchild Creek from the left, Haskins Creek from the right, and Cedar Creek from the left before reaching Pike at RM 20 (RK 32). Shortly thereafter, the river turns southeast, and Turner Creek enters from the left.

About below Pike, the valley widens, and the river begins to meander and to turn more sharply south, receiving Hutchcroft Creek from the right and Salt Creek from the left near RM 16 (RK 26). Turning southeast again, the river flows by the city of Yamhill, which lies to its left, and receives Rowland Creek and Yamhill Creek, both from the left. From Yamhill to the mouth, the North Yamhill River flows generally south and roughly parallel to Oregon Route 47, which lies to its left. Soon the river reaches Alecs Butte, a summit at , on the left at about RM 13 (RK 21).

About later, the stream enters Carlton Lake Wildlife Refuge and flows through it, reaching the city of Carlton, on the left at RM 10 (RK 16). Slightly downstream of RM 4.0 (RK 6.4), Panther Creek enters from the right. The river passes under Oregon Route 99W at about RM 1.0 (RK 1.6) before joining the South Yamhill River to form the Yamhill River, an tributary of the Willamette River.

<text>The South Yamhill River is a tributary of the Yamhill River, approximately long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range, as well as part of the Willamette Valley west of the Willamette River.

==Course==
The South Yamhill River rises at an elevation of above sea level and falls between source and mouth to an elevation of . It begins at the confluence of Hanchet Creek and Kitten Creek in the Siuslaw National Forest of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. The source, at about river mile (RM) 60 or river kilometer (RK) 97 lies near the border between Tillamook and Yamhill counties west of the Grand Ronde Community, an Indian reservation.
Flowing southeast on the north side of Oregon Route 22 in Yamhill County, the river receives Pierce Creek and Ead Creek from the , and Cedar Creek from the before flowing under the highway at about RM 57 (RK 92). Continuing parallel to the highway, which lies to its left, the river receives Crooked Creek from the left and Elmer Creek from the right before passing Midway and entering Polk County at about RM 55 (RK 89). Just beyond the county border, Agency Creek enters from the left. About later, the river receives the Rogue River from the left, reaches Grand Ronde, and passes under Grand Ronde Road and Oregon Route 18, a highway connecting the Portland metropolitan area to the Oregon Coast. Shortly thereafter, Rock Creek enters from the right.

Turning east and running roughly parallel to Route 18, the river receives Rowell Creek from the right before passing under the highway for the second time at Valley Junction and receiving Casper Creek from the left at about RM 50 (RK 80). Running north of Route 18 for about , the stream receives Klees Creek from the left and passes under the highway for the third time at Fort Hill. Flowing south of the highway, the river receives Gold Creek, Lady Creek, and Doane Creek, all from the right, and Cockerham Creek from the left before passing under Route 18 for the fourth time at about RM 45 (RK 72). Shortly thereafter, it reaches Willamina, re-entering Yamhill County and receiving Willamina Creek from the left at about RM 43 (RK 69). About later, Ash Creek enters from the left.

Continuing generally east and running between West Valley Highway on the left and Route 18 on the right, the river meanders slightly north of east, receiving Mill Creek from the right and Rock Creek from the left before reaching Sheridan at about RM 38 (RK 61). About later, it passes under Route 18 for the fifth time and meanders generally east until turning north, still roughly parallel to the highway, at RM 30 (RK 48). About later, Deer Creek enters from the left, and later, Salt Creek enters from the right. Shortly thereafter, the South Yamhill River passes under Oregon Route 99W and continues northeast toward McMinnville Municipal Airport. In a series of wide meanders starting at about RM 10 (RK 16), the river turns away from the airport and flows under Route 18 for the sixth and last time at RM 5.6 (RK 9.0), the site of a stream gauge maintained by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The river flows by the east side of McMinnville, where it receives Cozine Creek from the left. It continues generally northeast to join the North Yamhill River to form the Yamhill River, an tributary of the Willamette River.

==River levels==

The National Weather Service measures river levels at two locations along the South Yamhill River. Near Willamina, the highest recorded water level was about in December 1964. No low-water records are available for this gauge. At McMinnville, the highest recorded water level was about in February 1996, and the lowest was zero in October 1996.

<doc id="708437" wikidata="Q4866453" url="?curid=708437" title="1938 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting">
<text>The 1938 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were conducted along much the same lines as the 1937 vote. Toward the goal of 10 initial inductees from the 20th century, eight had now been selected; members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting active players. The Centennial Commission retained the responsibility of selecting inductees whose contributions were largely as non-players.

As the obvious stars had already been elected, only pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander was selected via the BBWAA ballot. The Centennial Commission selected Alexander Cartwright and Henry Chadwick.

==BBWAA vote==
In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport&#x27;s supposed centennial year of 1939. Individuals who had been barred from baseball, though not formally ineligible, no longer received even the minimal support given them in the two prior elections.

A total of 262 ballots were cast, with 2,475 individual votes for 120 specific candidates, an average of 9.45 per ballot; 197 votes were required for election. The balloting was dominated by players of the 1900s and 1910s, rather than those of the more recent two decades; the results were announced in January 1938. The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:



==Centennial Commission==
Once again, the Hall opted to have this small committee of six members select inductees &quot;for outstanding service to base ball apart from playing the game.&quot; After selecting five individuals in 1937, the Commission chose two inductees at the major league winter meetings in New York City in December 1938, though the choices were not announced until the following month:

*Alexander Cartwright, who had been instrumental in organizing some of the game&#x27;s first teams in the 1840s and had moved to establish the game&#x27;s first consistent playing rules; and
*Henry Chadwick, a sportswriter who had tirelessly promoted the game in the late 19th century and had been a major force in revision of the rules through several decades. To date he is the only sportswriter (or commentator) to be inducted into the &quot;real&quot; Hall of Fame (as opposed to the writers&#x27; and commentators&#x27; &quot;wings&quot;).

<text>The Luckiamute River is a tributary of the Willamette River, about long, in western Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of Central Oregon Coast Range and the western Willamette Valley northwest of Corvallis.

It rises in the remote mountains of southwestern Polk County, about west of Pedee. It flows southeast to Hoskins in Benton County, then northeast into Polk County, past Pedee, then east across southern Polk County. It is joined from the northwest by the Little Luckiamute River. It joins the Willamette from the west about north of Albany. The mouth of the river is about downstream from the mouth of the Santiam River, which enters the Willamette from the east upstream of the Willamette&#x27;s mouth on the Columbia River.

Named tributaries from source to mouth are Boulder, Beaver, Miller, Wolf, Rock Pit, Slick, Cougar, Slide, and Harris creeks. Further downstream are Hull, Foster, Jones, Bonner, Vincent, Plunkett, and Price creeks. Maxfield Creek is next followed by Bump, Ritner, Pedee, McTimmonds, Link, Dry, and Jont creeks followed by the Little Luckiamute River. Soap Creek enters the main stem along the Luckiamute&#x27;s lower reaches.

The Luckiamute Watershed Council includes Ash Creek in its watershed study area, although it drains directly into the Willamette River.

<text>Joseph Fred Hueglin (February 7, 1937 – July 5, 2022) was a Canadian politician who was a member of Parliament and a founder of the Progressive Canadian Party.

Born in Stratford, Ontario, Hueglin was elected to Parliament in 1972 in the riding of Niagara Falls as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC). In 1974 Hueglin was defeated by the Liberal candidate.

Within the Progressive Conservative Party, Hueglin was, along with David Orchard, among the most vocal opponents of the 2003 merger of Canada&#x27;s two prominent right-wing parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance, into the Conservative Party of Canada. He expressed discomfort over the way the merger took place - which involved PC leader Peter MacKay breaking an anti-merger promise he had made while campaigning to be the party leader. Hueglin also expressed discomfort over the &quot;neoconservative&quot; aspects of Alliance policy, which he feared might dominate the policies of the new party.

In 2004, Hueglin became a lead organizer for the Progressive Canadian Party, which he described as a centrist party.

<text>Eating your own dog food or &quot;dogfooding&quot; is the practice of using one&#x27;s own products or services. This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage using product management techniques. Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising. Once in the market, dogfooding can demonstrate developers&#x27; confidence in their own products.

== Origin of the term ==
In 2006, Warren Harrison, the Editor-in-Chief of &quot;IEEE Software&quot; recounted that in the 1970s television advertisements for Alpo dog food, spokesperson and actor Lorne Greene pointed out that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. Another possible origin he remembered was that the president of Kal Kan Pet Food was said to eat a can of his dog food at annual shareholders&#x27; meetings.

In 1988, Microsoft manager Paul Maritz sent Brian Valentine, test manager for Microsoft LAN Manager, an email titled &quot;Eating our own Dogfood&quot;, challenging him to increase internal usage of the company&#x27;s product. From there, the usage of the term spread through the company.

== Real world usage ==
&quot;InfoWorld&quot; commented that this needs to be a transparent and honest process: In this sense, a corporate culture of not supporting the competitor is not the same as a philosophy of &quot;eating your own dog food&quot;. The latter focuses on the functional aspects of the company&#x27;s own product.

Dogfooding allows employees to test their company&#x27;s products in real-life situations; a perceived, but still controversial, advantage beyond marketing, which gives management a sense of how the product might be used—all before launch to consumers. In software development, dogfooding can occur in multiple stages: first, a stable version of the software is used with just a single new feature added. Then, multiple new features can be combined into a single version of the software and tested together. This allows several validations before the software is released. The practice enables proactive resolution of potential inconsistency and dependency issues, especially when several developers or teams work on the same product.

The risks of public dogfooding, specifically that a company may have difficulties using its own products, may reduce the frequency of publicized dogfooding.

== Examples ==
In February 1980, Apple Computer president Michael Scott wrote a memo announcing He set a goal to remove all typewriters from the company by 1 January 1981.

By 1987, Atari Corp. was in the process of using the Atari ST throughout the company.

The development of Windows NT at Microsoft involved over 200 developers in small teams, and it was held together by Dave Cutler&#x27;s February 1991 insistence on dogfooding. Microsoft developed the operating system on computers running NT daily builds. The software was initially crash prone, but the immediate feedback of code breaking the build, the loss of pride, and the knowledge of impeding the work of others were all powerful motivators. Windows developers would typically dogfood or self-host Windows starting from the early (alpha) builds, while the rest of the employees would start from the more stable beta builds that were also available to MSDN subscribers. In 2005, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported that a tour of Microsoft&#x27;s network operations center . &quot;InfoWorld&quot; argued that 

In the mid-1990s, Microsoft&#x27;s internal email system was initially developed around Unix. When asked why, they publicly moved to using Microsoft Exchange. In 1997, an email storm known as the Bedlam DL3 incident made Microsoft build more robust features into Microsoft Exchange Server to avoid lost and duplicate emails and network and server down-time, although dogfooding is rarely so dramatic. A second email storm in 2006 was handled perfectly by the system.

In 1999, Hewlett-Packard staff referred to a project using HP&#x27;s own products as &quot;Project Alpo&quot; (referring to a brand of dog food). Around the same time, Mozilla also practised dogfooding under that exact name.

Government green public procurement that allows testing of proposed environmental policies has been compared to dogfooding.

On 1 June 2011, YouTube added a license feature to its video uploading service allowing users to choose between a standard or Creative Commons license. The license label was followed by the message &quot;(Shh! – Internal Dogfood)&quot; that appeared on all YouTube videos lacking commercial licensing. A YouTube employee confirmed that this referred to products that are tested internally.

Oracle Corporation stated that it .

After the CrowdStrike outages in July 2024, CEO Adam Meyers testified before the US Congress that &quot;dogfooding&quot; (increasing its internal testing before deployment) was one measure the company had put in place to prevent future problems.

== Criticisms and support ==
Forcing those who design products to actually use and rely on them is sometimes thought to improve quality and usability, but software developers may be blind to usability and may have knowledge to make software work that an end user will lack. Microsoft&#x27;s chief information officer noted in 2008 that, previously, Dogfooding may happen too early to be viable, and those forced to use the products may get used to applying workarounds or may assume that someone else has reported the problem. Dogfooding may be unrealistic, as customers will always have a choice of different companies&#x27; products to use together, and the product may not be used as intended. The process can lead to a loss of productivity and demoralisation, or at its extreme to &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome, i.e. only using internal products.

In 1989, Donald Knuth published a paper recounting lessons from the development of his TeX Typesetting software, in which the benefits of the approach were mentioned:

== Alternative terms ==
In 2007, Jo Hoppe, the CIO of Pegasystems, said that she uses the alternative phrase &quot;drinking our own champagne&quot;. Novell&#x27;s head of public relations Bruce Lowry, commenting on his company&#x27;s use of Linux and OpenOffice.org, said that he also prefers this phrase. In 2009, the new CIO of Microsoft, Tony Scott, argued that the phrase &quot;dogfooding&quot; was unappealing and should be replaced by &quot;icecreaming&quot;, with the aim of developing products as . A less controversial and common alternative term used in some contexts is self-hosting, where developers&#x27; workstations would, for instance, get updated automatically overnight to the latest daily build of the software or operating system on which they work. Developers of IBM&#x27;s mainframe operating systems have long used the term &quot;eating our own cooking&quot;.
