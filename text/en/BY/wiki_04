<text>An economic system, or economic order, is a system of production, resource allocation and distribution of goods and services within a society. It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community.

An economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept. All economic systems must confront and solve the four fundamental economic problems:
* What kinds and quantities of goods shall be produced: This fundamental economic problem is anchored on the theory of pricing. The theory of pricing, in this context, has to do with the economic decision-making between the production of capital goods and consumer goods in the economy in the face of scarce resources. In this regard, the critical evaluation of the needs of the society based on population distribution in terms of age, sex, occupation, and geography is very pertinent. 
* How goods shall be produced: The fundamental problem of how goods shall be produced is largely hinged on the least-cost method of production to be adopted as gainfully peculiar to the economically decided goods and services to be produced. On a broad note, the possible production method includes labor-intensive and capital-intensive methods. 
* How the output will be distributed: Production is said to be completed when the goods get to the final consumers. This fundamental problem clogs in the wheel of the chain of economic resources distributions can reduce to the barest minimum and optimize consumers&#x27; satisfaction. 
* When to produce: Consumer satisfaction is partly a function of seasonal analysis as the forces of demand and supply have a lot to do with time. This fundamental economic problem requires an intensive study of time dynamics and seasonal variation vis-a-vis the satisfaction of consumers&#x27; needs. It is noteworthy to state that solutions to these fundamental problems can be determined by the type of economic system.

The study of economic systems includes how these various agencies and institutions are linked to one another, how information flows between them, and the social relations within the system (including property rights and the structure of management). The analysis of economic systems traditionally focused on the dichotomies and comparisons between market economies and planned economies and on the distinctions between capitalism and socialism. Subsequently, the categorization of economic systems expanded to include other topics and models that do not conform to the traditional dichotomy.

Today the dominant form of economic organization at the world level is based on market-oriented mixed economies. An economic system can be considered a part of the social system and hierarchically equal to the law system, political system, cultural and so on. There is often a strong correlation between certain ideologies, political systems and certain economic systems (for example, consider the meanings of the term &quot;communism&quot;). Many economic systems overlap each other in various areas (for example, the term &quot;mixed economy&quot; can be argued to include elements from various systems). There are also various mutually exclusive hierarchical categorizations.

== Academic field of study ==
Economic systems is the category in the &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot; classification codes that includes the study of such systems. One field that cuts across them is comparative economic systems, which includes the study of the following aspects of different systems: 
* Planning, coordination and reform.
* Productive enterprises; factor and product markets; prices; population.
* National income, product and expenditure; money; inflation.
* International trade, finance, investment and aid.
* Consumer economics; welfare and poverty.
* Performance and prospects.
* Natural resources; energy; environment; regional studies.
* Political economy; legal institutions; property rights.

== Main types ==

=== Capitalism ===
Capitalism generally features the private ownership of the means of production (capital) and a market economy for coordination. Corporate capitalism refers to a capitalist marketplace characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.

Mercantilism was the dominant model in Western Europe from the 16th to 18th century. This encouraged imperialism and colonialism until economic and political changes resulted in global decolonization. Modern capitalism has favored free trade to take advantage of increased efficiency due to national comparative advantage and economies of scale in a larger, more universal market. Some critics have applied the term neo-colonialism to the power imbalance between multi-national corporations operating in a free market vs. seemingly impoverished people in developing countries.

=== Mixed economy ===

There is no precise definition of a &quot;mixed economy&quot;. Theoretically, it may refer to an economic system that combines one of three characteristics: public and private ownership of industry, market-based allocation with economic planning, or free markets with state interventionism.

In practice, &quot;mixed economy&quot; generally refers to market economies with substantial state interventionism and/or sizable public sector alongside a dominant private sector. Actually, mixed economies gravitate more heavily to one end of the spectrum. Notable economic models and theories that have been described as a &quot;mixed economy&quot; include the following:
* Georgism – socialized rents on land
* Mixed economy (It can be categorized under many titles)
** American School
** Dirigisme (Government-directed capitalist economy)
** Indicative planning, also known as a planned market economy
** Japanese system
** Nordic model (Social democrat economics of Nordic countries)
** Progressive utilization theory
** Corporatism (economies based on tripartite negotiation between labor, capital, and the state)
** Social market economy, also known as &quot;Soziale Marktwirtschaft&quot; (Mixed capitalist)
**New Economic Policy (Mixed socialist)
** State capitalism (Government-dominated capitalist economy)
**Socialist Market Economy (Mixed socialist)

=== Socialist economy ===
Socialist economic systems (all of which feature social ownership of the means of production) can be subdivided by their coordinating mechanism (planning and markets) into planned socialist and market socialist systems. Additionally, socialism can be divided based on their property structures between those that are based on public ownership, worker or consumer cooperatives and common ownership (i.e. non-ownership). Communism is a hypothetical stage of socialist development articulated by Karl Marx as &quot;second stage socialism&quot; in &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;, whereby the economic output is distributed based on need and not simply on the basis of labor contribution.

The original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with calculation in kind (or a valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system. Later models of socialism developed by neoclassical economists (most notably Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner) were based on the use of notional prices derived from a trial-and-error approach to achieve market clearing prices on the part of a planning agency. These models of socialism were called &quot;market socialism&quot; because they included a role for markets, money, and prices.

The primary emphasis of socialist planned economies is to coordinate production to produce economic output to directly satisfy economic demand as opposed to the indirect mechanism of the profit system where satisfying needs is subordinate to the pursuit of profit; and to advance the productive forces of the economy in a more efficient manner while being immune to the perceived systemic inefficiencies (cyclical processes) and crisis of overproduction so that production would be subject to the needs of society as opposed to being ordered around capital accumulation.

In a pure socialist planned economy that involves different processes of resource allocation, production and means of quantifying value, the use of money would be replaced with a different measure of value and accounting tool that would embody more accurate information about an object or resource. In practice, the economic system of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc operated as a command economy, featuring a combination of state-owned enterprises and central planning using the material balances method. The extent to which these economic systems achieved socialism or represented a viable alternative to capitalism is subject to debate.

In orthodox Marxism, the mode of production is tantamount to the subject of this article, determining with a superstructure of relations the entirety of a given culture or stage of human development.
== Components ==
There are multiple components of an economic system. Decision-making structures of an economy determine the use of economic inputs (the factors of production), distribution of output, the level of centralization in decision-making and who makes these decisions. Decisions might be carried out by industrial councils, by a government agency, or by private owners.

An economic system is a system of production, resource allocation, exchange and distribution of goods and services in a society or a given geographic area. In one view, every economic system represents an attempt to solve three fundamental and interdependent problems:
* What goods and services shall be produced and in what quantities?
* How shall goods and services be produced? That is, by whom and with what resources and technologies?
* For whom shall goods and services be produced? That is, who is to enjoy the benefits of the goods and services and how is the total product to be distributed among individuals and groups in the society?

Every economy is thus a system that allocates resources for exchange, production, distribution and consumption. The system is stabilized through a combination of threat and trust, which are the outcome of institutional arrangements.

An economic system possesses the following institutions:
* Methods of control over the factors or means of production: this may include ownership of, or property rights to, the means of production and therefore may give rise to claims to the proceeds from production. The means of production may be owned privately, by the state, by those who use them, or be held in common.
* A decision-making system: this determines who is eligible to make decisions over economic activities. Economic agents with decision-making powers can enter into binding contracts with one another.
* A coordination mechanism: this determines how information is obtained and used in decision-making. The two dominant forms of coordination are planning and markets; planning can be either decentralized or centralized, and the two coordination mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and often co-exist.
* An incentive system: this induces and motivates economic agents to engage in productive activities. It can be based on either material reward (compensation or self-interest) or moral suasion (for instance, social prestige or through a democratic decision-making process that binds those involved). The incentive system may encourage specialization and the division of labor.
* Organizational form: there are two basic forms of organization: actors and regulators. Economic actors include households, work gangs and production teams, firms, joint-ventures and cartels. Economically regulative organizations are represented by the state and market authorities; the latter may be private or public entities.
* A distribution system: this allocates the proceeds from productive activity, which is distributed as income among the economic organizations, individuals and groups within society, such as property owners, workers and non-workers, or the state (from taxes).
* A public choice mechanism for law-making, establishing rules, norms and standards and levying taxes. Usually, this is the responsibility of the state, but other means of collective decision-making are possible, such as chambers of commerce or workers&#x27; councils.

== Typology ==

There are several basic questions that must be answered in order for an economy to run satisfactorily. The scarcity problem, for example, requires answers to basic questions, such as what to produce, how to produce it and who gets what is produced. An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions and different economic systems answer them differently. Many different objectives may be seen as desirable for an economy, like efficiency, growth, liberty and equality.

Economic systems are commonly segmented by their property rights regime for the means of production and by their dominant resource allocation mechanism. Economies that combine private ownership with market allocation are called &quot;market capitalism&quot; and economies that combine private ownership with economic planning are labelled &quot;command capitalism&quot; or dirigisme. Likewise, systems that mix public or cooperative ownership of the means of production with economic planning are called &quot;socialist planned economies&quot; and systems that combine public or cooperative ownership with markets are called &quot;market socialism&quot;. Some perspectives build upon this basic nomenclature to take other variables into account, such as class processes within an economy. This leads some economists to categorize, for example, the Soviet Union&#x27;s economy as state capitalism based on the analysis that the working class was exploited by the party leadership. Instead of looking at nominal ownership, this perspective takes into account the organizational form within economic enterprises.

In a capitalist economic system, production is carried out for private profit and decisions regarding investment and allocation of factor inputs are determined by business owners in factor markets. The means of production are primarily owned by private enterprises and decisions regarding production and investment are determined by private owners in capital markets. Capitalist systems range from &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, with minimal government regulation and state enterprise, to regulated and social market systems, with the aims of ameliorating market failures (see economic intervention) or supplementing the private marketplace with social policies to promote equal opportunities (see welfare state), respectively.

In socialist economic systems (socialism), production for use is carried out; decisions regarding the use of the means of production are adjusted to satisfy economic demand; and investment is determined through economic planning procedures. There is a wide range of proposed planning procedures and ownership structures for socialist systems, with the common feature among them being the social ownership of the means of production. This might take the form of public ownership by all of the society, or ownership cooperatively by their employees. A socialist economic system that features social ownership, but that it is based on the process of capital accumulation and utilization of capital markets for the allocation of capital goods between socially owned enterprises falls under the subcategory of market socialism.

=== By resource allocation mechanism ===
The basic and general &quot;modern&quot; economic systems segmented by the criterium of resource allocation mechanism are:
* Market economy (&quot;hands off&quot; systems, such as &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism)
* Mixed economy (a hybrid that blends some aspects of both market and planned economies)
* Planned economy (&quot;hands on&quot; systems, such as state socialism, also known as &quot;command economy&quot; when referring to the Soviet model)

Other types:
* Traditional economy (a generic term for older economic systems, opposed to modern economic systems)
** Non-monetary economy (without the use of money, opposed to monetary economy)
** Subsistence economy (without surplus, exchange or market trade)
** Gift economy (where an exchange is made without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards and profits)
** Barter economy (where goods and services are directly exchanged for other goods or services)
* Participatory economics (a decentralized economic planning system where the production and distribution of goods is guided by public participation)
* Post-scarcity economy (a hypothetical form where resources are not scarce)

=== By ownership of the means of production ===
* Capitalism (private ownership of the means of production)
* Mixed economy
* Socialist economy (social ownership of the means of production)

=== By political ideologies ===
Various strains of anarchism and libertarianism advocate different economic systems, all of which have very small or no government involvement. These include:
* Left-wing
** Anarcho-communism
** Anarcho-syndicalism
** Anarcho-socialism
* Right-wing
** Anarcho-capitalism
* Libertarianism
** Libertarian socialism
** Syndicalism

=== By other criteria ===
Corporatism refers to economic tripartite involving negotiations between business, labor and state interest groups to establish economic policy, or more generally to assigning people to political groups based on their occupational affiliation.

Certain subsets of an economy, or the particular goods, services, techniques of production, or moral rules can also be described as an &quot;economy&quot;. For example, some terms emphasize specific sectors or externalizes:
* Circular economy
* Collectivist economy
* Digital economy
* Green economy
* Information economy
* Internet economy
* Knowledge economy
* Natural economy
* Virtual economy
* Human Resource Economic System 

Others emphasize a particular religion:
* Arthashastra – Hindu Economics
* Buddhist economics
* Distributism – Catholic ideal of a &quot;third way&quot; economy, featuring more distributed ownership in a mixed economy
* Islamic economics

The type of labour power:
* Slave – and serf-based economy
* Wage labour-based economy

Or the means of production:
* Agrarian economy
* Industrial economy
* Information economy

== Evolutionary economics ==

Karl Marx&#x27;s theory of economic development was based on the premise of evolving economic systems. Specifically, in his view over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and inefficiencies that would make it impossible for them to survive long-term. In Marx&#x27;s scheme, feudalism was replaced by capitalism, which would eventually be superseded by socialism. Joseph Schumpeter had an evolutionary conception of economic development, but unlike Marx he de-emphasized the role of class struggle in contributing to qualitative change in the economic mode of production. In subsequent world history, many communist states run according to Marxist–Leninist ideologies arose during the 20th century, but by the 1990s they had either ceased to exist or gradually reformed their centrally planned economies toward market-based economies, for example with perestroika and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Chinese economic reform and in Vietnam.

Mainstream evolutionary economics continues to study economic change in modern times. There has also been renewed interest in understanding economic systems as evolutionary systems in the emerging field of complexity economics.

<text>Francis Gilles Poullain-Patterson (born 15 April 1967), better known as Frankie Poullain, is a Scottish bass player, best known for playing with The Darkness. He was raised in Milnathort, then Edinburgh, Scotland.

== Early life ==
His father was Austin Patterson, a classical violinist, who played with The Edinburgh Quartet and BBC Concert Orchestra in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He uses his French mother’s Poullain surname as she brought him up from the age of 7, when his father left him to live in the Caribbean.

He attended the Royal High School, leaving in 1985.

He is the step-brother of comedian, Phil Kay.

He undertook a succession of menial jobs and played in local west country bands, before moving to London in order to become a serious musician.

After garnering attention but ultimately no record deal with his band Empire, he travelled to Venezuela, eventually becoming a tour guide and coming close to death when attacked by a nest of brown bees in the Orinoco Delta jungle. Shortly after this incident Justin Hawkins asked him to return to London and play bass in the newly named The Darkness, in which he himself would sing after being the keyboardist in the previous incarnation as ‘Empire.’

== Biography ==
Poullain began a BA Honours in English literature at Bath University in 1986 but left in his second year, becoming disillusioned with the teaching and intent on becoming a writer or musician in his own right. 

Poullain&#x27;s tongue in cheek self-help book &quot;Dancing in the Darkness&quot; was released in November 2008.

==Music career ==
In 1996, Poullain founded the band Empire which the Hawkins brothers Justin Hawkins and Dan Hawkins joined in 1997, and which later became The Darkness. 

With The Darkness he has won 3 Brits as well as MTV, Kerrang and Classic Rock awards. The band were nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2003. He won an Ivor Novello award, along with his fellow band members in 2004, for ‘Songwriters Of The Year’. 

Poullain left the band on 23 May 2005 citing &quot;musical differences&quot;. He was replaced by Richie Edwards, a former guitar technician for the band. 

In 2011 The Darkness announced that they were to reunite with all four original members. Poullain described this as being &quot;just like old times&quot;. 

Poullain is a co-writer on some of the band’s most popular songs such as ‘Love Is Only A Feeling’, ‘Heart Explodes’, ‘One Way Ticket’ and ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Deserves To Die’. He composed the music for the first ever Darkness song, ‘I Love You 5 Times’ in 1996, which was later recorded at Abbey Road studios and released as the B side to the band’s Christmas single ‘Christmas Time (Don’t Let The Bells End)’ in 2003

In 2016, Poullain sang lead vocals on ‘Conquerors’, the last song on the album ‘Last of our Kind. The song was featured in the 2023 Simon Emmett documentary about the band ‘Welcome To The Darkness.’ 

== Equipment ==
Poullain’s bass of choice is the Gibson Thunderbird which is used almost exclusively on the band’s various albums. He plays through a Hiwatt 200 bass head and an 8x10 speaker. He also uses an Aguilar Tone Hammer to define his sound. 

He plays cowbell on various songs but most famously on the band’s single ‘One Way Ticket’ which features an extended live intro showcasing his skills.

<text>Charles William Fox, DFC
and Bar, CD (February 26, 1920 – October 18, 2008) was a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II. He attended Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute.

==Biography==
Fox, the son of an Irish immigrant, joined the RCAF in 1939 at the beginning of the war (his brother Ted joined the Royal Canadian Artillery). He graduated near the top of his class in 1941 and was offered a job as a flight instructor in Dunnville, Ontario. He remained in this position until 1943 when he began combat training in Bagotville, Quebec. He flew Spitfires over Europe, destroying or damaging 153 enemy vehicles (mostly trains), and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (with bar).

In 1944, he began his tour of duty with the Canadian 412 Squadron. On D-Day he flew three patrols off the coast of France. On July 17, 1944, he flew from the Allied air base at Beny-sur-Mer in Normandy and strafed an unknown black car; he later learned that one of the passengers was German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who was seriously injured in the attack. This is disputed as a South African and RAF (Chris Le Roux of 602 Squadron) pilot, and a French and RAF ( of 602 Squadron) pilot also claimed to have been responsible for the attack. Australian Fred Cowpe of 453 Squadron also claimed responsibility for the strafing attack, asserting that his guns&#x27; camera verified the assertion. He recorded this action in his aircraft log book. As Rommel was soon afterwards implicated in the assassination plot against Adolf Hitler, he was allowed to commit suicide and his death was announced as a result of injuries from the air attack. In 2004 Fox was officially credited with injuring Rommel, although he expressed regret about the attack, as Rommel was supposedly planning to secretly negotiate an earlier end to the war with the Allies.

Fox ended his tour of duty in January 1945, and served in the 420 Reserve after the war. He retired in 1956 and began to work at a shoe factory, from which he retired in 1998. On April 30, 2004, he was named honorary colonel of 412 Squadron in Ottawa, ultimately belonging to 8 Wing/CFB Trenton. For his long service in the RCAF, he was awarded the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration.

He died in a car accident near Tillsonburg, Ontario, on October 18, 2008.

==Legacy==

Fourteen of Fox&#x27;s planes were judged to be no longer usable after returning from missions due to excessive damage from enemy fire.

Charles Fox was noted as an educator of youth and spokesperson for veterans. He founded Torch Bearers, a non-profit organization aimed at educating young people about Canadian military exploits. He regularly took on speaking engagements to keep veterans&#x27; stories alive and fought with school boards to ensure Remembrance Day ceremonies were held annually.

According to Fox&#x27;s family, he spent his life wondering why he survived numerous dates with death and was in the process of telling his story and those of other veterans in a book titled &quot;Why Not Me?&quot;, which the family hopes to finish. &quot;It did give him a purpose in life and he was searching for that,&quot; according to his son.

Mr. Fox had one son (James William Fox), two daughters (Susan Fox and Adrienne Black), nine grandchildren, three step-grandchildren, and fourteen great-grandchildren.

===Memorial===
In 2011, local officials in coordination with the federal government, dedicated the Charley Fox Memorial Overpass in London, Ontario. The overpass - the first arterial road roundabout in the city - was built to facilitate the safe passage of pedestrians over a CN rail line, as well as easing traffic when a train passed. It was named in his honour in recognition for his service to Canada during the war and his efforts to educated young people about Canada&#x27;s military past. The center of the roundabout features a sculpture created by artists Daniel Castillo and Jerry Vrabec. The artwork is part of the City of London Public Art collection.

<text>Hair analysis may refer to the chemical analysis of a hair sample, but can also refer to microscopic analysis or comparison. Chemical hair analysis may be considered for retrospective purposes when blood and urine are no longer expected to contain a particular contaminant, typically three months or less.

Its most widely accepted use is in the fields of forensic toxicology, in pre-employment drug testing and, increasingly, in environmental toxicology. Several alternative medicine fields also use various hair analyses for environmental toxicology, but these uses are controversial, evolving, and not standardized.

Microscopic hair analysis has traditionally been used in forensics as well. Analysts examine a number of different characteristics of hairs under a microscope, usually comparing hair taken from a crime scene and hair taken from a suspect. It is still acknowledged as a useful technique for confirming that hairs do not match. But DNA testing of evidence has overturned many convictions that relied on hair analysis. Since 2012, the Department of Justice has conducted a study of cases in which hair analysis testimony was given by its agents, and found that a high proportion of testimony could not be supported by the state of science of hair analysis.

== In forensic toxicology ==

Chemical hair analysis is used for the detection of many therapeutic drugs and recreational drugs, including cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepines and amphetamines. Hair analysis is less invasive than a blood test, if not quite as universally applicable. In this context, it has been reliably used to determine compliance with therapeutic drug regimes or to check the accuracy of a witness statement that an illicit drug has not been taken. Hair testing is an increasingly common method of assessment in substance misuse, particularly in legal proceedings, or in any situation where a subject may have decided not to tell the entire truth about his or her substance-using history. Post-mortem hair sample analysis can also be performed, to allow for determination of long-term drug use or poisoning. It is also used by employers, who test their employees.

Hair analysis has the virtue of showing a &#x27;history&#x27; of drug use due to hair&#x27;s slow growth. Urine analysis might detect drugs taken in the past 2–3 days; hair analysis can sometimes detect use as far as 90 days, although certain cosmetic treatments (e.g. dyeing hair) can interfere with this. 
Notably, basic drugs get incorporated into hair to a greater extent than neutral or acidic drugs, e.g. amphetamines and cocaine
are present in higher concentrations in hair compared with
benzodiazepines and cannabinoids.

Large-scale drug screening (or urine, hair and other samples) is usually done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Positive ELISA findings are followed by confirmatory testing with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Chromato-mass-spectrometry is less likely to result in false positive findings than ELISA, but the former requires expensive equipment and highly trained personnel. 

The judicial admissibility of the test in the United States is guided by the Daubert standard. A notable court case was &quot;United States v. Medina, 749 F.Supp. 59 (E.D.N.Y.1990)&quot;.
== Microscopic hair analysis in forensics ==

Microscopic hair analysis consists of the comparison of several strands of hair under a microscope and determining if the physical characteristics of each individual hairs are consistent with each other or not. It was accepted as a forensic science by the 1950s. Researchers often monitored more than a dozen attributes, including pigment distribution and scale patterns. This technique has been used in criminal investigations to try to tie hair found at a crime scene, or other location of note, and confirm if the hair matches that of a suspect. While a simple hair color match might be &quot;consistent&quot; with a certain suspect having been at the scene – black hair at the scene when the suspect has black hair – microscopic hair analysis began to claim a stronger standard by the 1970s. Rather than merely &quot;narrow the field&quot; of possibilities, hair analysts claimed to be able to match a specific person, such that the hair could be &#x27;proof&#x27; of a specific suspect&#x27;s presence. While the typed reports often hedged the certainty of microscopic hair analysis, witnesses in court would not always be as modest. The manager of the Montana state crime lab testified there was a &quot;1 in 10,000 chance&quot; that hairs found at a crime scene did not come from the suspect in one case, for example.

Microscopic hair analysis has a long tradition of being used in crime fiction as well; it was originally popularized in the Sherlock Holmes series before being widely used by the police. Fictional TV programs involving police procedurals and detectives have continued to use it since, including &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Quincy, ME&quot;, &quot;Dexter&quot;, and &quot;CSI&quot;.

Skepticism about the stronger claims used by witnesses in the 1970s and 1980s existed at the time. Researchers said in 1974 that the whole process was inherently subjective, and the FBI wrote in 1984 that hair analysis cannot positively match one single person. In the 1990s, DNA profiling was introduced as a key new technique into forensics investigations; it introduced a new level of certainty about matching suspects to evidence. DNA analysis of old cases from the 1970s and 80s, however, contradicted conclusions about a number of earlier matches on the basis of hair analysis.

In 1994, the Justice Department created a task force which would eventually review 6,000 cases by 2004, focusing on the work of one particularly zealous examiner, Michael Malone. These reviews came after reports that sloppy work by examiners at the FBI lab was producing unreliable forensic evidence in court trials. At first, these investigations were largely kept quiet; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Instead of releasing those findings, they made them available only to the prosecutors in the affected cases.&quot; A study of FBI Laboratory hair analysis cases between 1996 and 2000 was released in 2002 by Max M. Houck and Bruce Budowle. The study showed that 11% of hair analysis &quot;matches&quot; were contradicted by DNA analysis. As the set of cases analyzed was one which would be expected to favor matches strongly in any case – only hair of individuals the police already believed to be potential suspects was sent in – this error rate was considered to be extremely high.

Kirk L. Odom was convicted of rape in Washington, DC in 1982 by no physical evidence except microscopic hair analysis performed by the FBI Crime Laboratory. Combined with a witness&#x27;s identification in a line-up (another technique which modern research has shown to be much less reliable than previously thought), Odom was sentenced to twenty or more years in jail. DNA analysis, however, proved that Odom was entirely innocent. While Odom had been released from prison in 2003, he was officially exonerated in 2012 and was paid a large settlement by the city.

In a similar case, Santae Tribble was convicted in 1979 at the age of 17 in Washington, DC of murder due to FBI testimony in a hair analysis match of hair found at the scene. But he had three witnesses who gave him an alibi for the time when the crime was committed. The prosecutor overstated the reliability of hair analysis in identifying a single person, saying in his closing statement that &quot;There is one chance, perhaps for all we know, in 10 million that it could [be] someone else&#x27;s hair.&quot; DNA testing in January 2012, however, showed that the prosecution&#x27;s key piece of evidence, the hair, did not in fact match the defendant. Tribble was fully exonerated in December 2012, having served 28 years in prison that resulted in severe health problems.

The outcry from defense attorneys about the unreliability of hair analysis and overstatement by FBI experts has resulted in the FBI conducting a review of disputed hair analysis matches since 2012. Due to what it found, in July 2013 the Justice department began an &quot;unprecedented&quot; review of older cases involving hair analysis, examining more than 21,000 cases referred to the FBI Lab&#x27;s hair unit from 1982 through 1999.

By 2015, these cases included as many as 32 death penalty convictions, in which FBI experts may have exaggerated the reliability of hair analysis in their testimony and affected the verdict. Of these, 14 persons have been executed or died in prison. In 2015, DOJ released findings on 268 trials examined so far in which hair analysis was used (the review was still in progress). The review concluded that in 257 of these 268 trials (95 percent), the analysts gave flawed testimony in court that overstated the accuracy of the findings in favor of the prosecution. About 1200 cases remain to be examined. The department emphasized its commitment to following up on these cases to correct any wrongs, saying that they &quot;are committed to ensuring that affected defendants are notified of past errors and that justice is done in every instance. The department and the FBI are also committed to ensuring the accuracy of future hair analysis, as well as the application of all disciplines of forensic science.&quot;

In 2017, new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, appointed by President Donald Trump, announced that this investigation would be suspended, at the same time that he announced the end of a forensic science commission that had been working to establish standards on several tests and to improve accuracy; it was a &quot;partnership with independent scientists to raise forensic science standards&quot;. Independent scientists, prosecutors, defense counsel and judges criticized ending the commission, saying that the criminal justice system needed to rely on the best science.

As of late 2019, 75 people who were convicted of a crime based on microscopic hair comparison were subsequently exonerated. Another notable case that received media attention since was Anthony Broadwater, who had been convicted of raping Alice Sebold in 1982, and was formally exonerated in 2021 after finishing his time in 1998. The only physical evidence the prosecution offered in 1982 was a hair analysis that was &quot;consistent&quot; with Broadwater. More alarmingly, the only reason the case was re-examined was the unusual fact that Sebold had written an extensive memoir of her experiences (&quot;Lucky&quot;), which allowed later investigators to uncover major problems with the case.

== In environmental toxicology ==

Analysis of hair samples has many advantages as a preliminary screening method for the presence of toxic substances deleterious to health after exposures in air, dust, sediment, soil and water, food and toxins in the environment. The advantages of hair analysis include the non-invasiveness, low cost, and the ability to measure a large number of, potentially interacting, toxic and biologically essential elements. Hence, head hair analysis is increasingly being used as a preliminary test to see whether individuals have absorbed poisons linked to behavioral or health problems.

=== Detection of long-term elemental effects ===

The use of hair analysis appears to be valid for the measurement of lifelong, or long-term heavy metal burden, if not the measurement of general elemental analysis. Several studies, including the analysis of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s hair, have been conducted in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a 1999 study on hair concentrations of calcium, iron, and zinc in pregnant women and effects of supplementation, it was concluded that &quot;From the analyses, it was clear that hair concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Zn could reflect the effects of supplementation... Finally, it could be concluded that mineral element deficiencies might be convalesced by adequate compensations of mineral element nutrients.&quot;

=== Occupational, environmental and alternative medicine ===

Hair analysis has been used in occupational, environmental and some branches of alternative medicine as a method of investigation to assist screening and/or diagnosis. The hair is sampled, processed and analyzed, studying the levels of mineral and metals in the hair sample. Using the results, as part of a proper examination or test protocol, practitioners screen for toxic exposure and heavy metal poisoning. Some advocates claim that they can also diagnose mineral deficiencies and that people with autism have unusual hair mineral contents. These uses are often controversial, and the American Medical Association states, &quot;The AMA opposes chemical analysis of the hair as a determinant of the need for medical therapy and supports informing the American public and appropriate governmental agencies of this unproven practice and its potential for health care fraud.&quot;
A recent review of scientific literature by Dr Kempson highlighted analysis of metals/minerals in hair can be applied in large population studies for researching epidemiology and groups of chronically exposed populations, however any attempt to provide a diagnosis based on hair for an individual is not possible. An exception to this can be in advanced analyses for acute poisoning.

<doc id="692305" wikidata="Q257179" url="?curid=692305" title="Dreamcatcher">
<text>In some Native American and First Nations cultures, a dreamcatcher (, the inanimate form of the word for &#x27;spider&#x27;) is a handmade willow hoop, on which is woven a net or web. It may also be decorated with sacred items such as certain feathers or beads. Traditionally, dreamcatchers are hung over a cradle or bed as protection. It originates in Anishinaabe culture as &quot;the spider web charm&quot; – &quot;asubakacin&quot; &#x27;net-like&#x27; (White Earth Nation); &quot;bwaajige ngwaagan&quot; &#x27;dream snare&#x27; (Curve Lake First Nation) – a hoop with woven string or sinew meant to replicate a spider&#x27;s web, used as a protective charm for infants.

Dream catchers were adopted in the Pan-Indian Movement of the 1960s and 1970s and gained popularity as widely marketed &quot;Native crafts items&quot; in the 1980s.

==Ojibwe origin==

Ethnographer Frances Densmore in 1929 recorded an Ojibwe legend according to which the &quot;spiderwebs&quot; protective charms originate with Spider Woman, known as &quot;Asibikaashi&quot;; who takes care of the children and the people on the land. As the Ojibwe Nation spread to the corners of North America it became difficult for Asibikaashi to reach all the children. So the mothers and grandmothers weave webs for the children, using willow hoops and sinew, or cordage made from plants. The purpose of these charms is apotropaic and not explicitly connected with dreams:
Even infants were provided with protective charms. Examples of these are the &quot;spiderwebs&quot; hung on the hoop of a cradle board. In old times this netting was made of nettle fiber. Two spider webs were usually hung on the hoop, and it was said that they &quot;caught any harm that might be in the air as a spider&#x27;s web catches and holds whatever comes in contact with it.&quot;

Basil Johnston, an elder from Neyaashiinigmiing, in his &quot;Ojibway Heritage&quot; (1976) gives the story of Spider (, &quot;little net maker&quot;) as a trickster figure catching Snake in his web.

==Modern uses==
While dreamcatchers continue to be used in a traditional manner in their communities and cultures of origin, derivative forms of dreamcatchers were adopted into the Pan-Indian movement of the 1960s and 1970s as a symbol of unity among the various Native American cultures, or as a general symbol of identification with Native American or First Nations cultures.

The name &quot;dream catcher&quot; was published in mainstream, non-Native media in the 1970s and became widely known as a Native crafts item by the 1980s. By the early 1990s, it was &quot;one of the most popular and marketable&quot; ones. 
In the course of becoming popular outside the Ojibwe Nation, and then outside the pan-Indian communities, various types of &quot;dreamcatchers&quot;, many of which bear little resemblance to traditional styles, and that incorporate materials that would not be traditionally used, are now made, exhibited, and sold by New Age groups and individuals. Many Native Americans have come to see these imitation dreamcatchers as over-commercialized, offensively misappropriated and misused by non-Natives.

A mounted and framed dreamcatcher is being used as a shared symbol of hope and healing by the Little Thunderbirds Drum and Dance Troupe from the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota. In recognition of the shared trauma and loss experienced, both at their school during the Red Lake shootings, and by other students who have survived similar school shootings, they have traveled to other schools to meet with students, share songs and stories, and gift them with the dreamcatcher. The dreamcatcher has been passed from Red Lake to students in several other towns where school shootings have occurred.

<doc id="692326" wikidata="Q1129086" url="?curid=692326" title="Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)">
<text>Contraband is the debut studio album by American hard rock band Velvet Revolver, released on June 8, 2004, by RCA Records. A commercial success, &quot;Contraband&quot; debuted at number one on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.

==Background and recording==

Velvet Revolver formed when Guns N&#x27; Roses musicians Slash (guitar), Duff McKagan (bass), and Matt Sorum (drums) combined to play at a benefit concert for fellow musician Randy Castillo in 2002. They decided to form a band and recruited guitarist Dave Kushner who had previously played with Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, and Dave Navarro. The quartet then set about recruiting a lead singer with the recruitment process filmed by VH1. Several lead singers auditioned including Josh Todd of Buckcherry, Kelly Shaefer of Neurotica and Travis Meeks of Days of the New. Scott Weiland had become friends with McKagan and had played on the same bill as Kushner when Stone Temple Pilots were known as Mighty Joe Young and Kushner was in the Electric Love Hogs. Weiland heard the material and offered his services as the lead singer and the band clicked. Slash suggested the name Revolver for the project while Weiland suggested Dead Velvet Revolver which was shortened to Velvet Revolver.

Velvet Revolver recorded its first track &quot;Set Me Free&quot; for &quot;The Hulk&quot; soundtrack in 2003, later incorporated into the album&#x27;s track listing, along with a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, which was later released as a B-side.

The band played their first live gig at the El Rey in Los Angeles in July 2003. They recorded &quot;Contraband&quot; in the latter part of 2003 with recording complicated by Weiland&#x27;s court appearances for drug charges and his subsequent sentencing to undertake rehabilitation. Slash recorded &quot;Sucker Train Blues&quot; with a Fender Telecaster 1956 and a Fender Stratocaster 1965.

== Release ==
The United States release of the disc uses the MediaMax CD-3 system for copy protection, while Macrovision CDS-200 is used for the European release. The album cover features a silhouette of American actress Rena Riffel.

In February 2005, RCA Records released a &quot;Tour Edition&quot; of the album in Europe, which included a bonus disc containing three tracks: B-sides &quot;Surrender&quot; (originally by Cheap Trick) and an acoustic &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, along with the exclusive &quot;No More, No More&quot; (originally by Aerosmith).

Scott Borchetta named his record label Big Machine Records after the &quot;Contraband&quot; song of the same name.

==Critical reception==
Metacritic.com has given &quot;Contraband&quot; an average score of 65 based on 14 reviews, indicating that the critical response has been &quot;generally favorable&quot;.

&quot;Mojo&quot; rated the album as &quot;a perpetually guilty pleasure.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine said it was &quot;astonishingly good&quot; rating it as four stars.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it as four stars out of five and said, &quot;it is a rare, fine thing: the sound of the perfect A&amp;R sales pitch turning into a real band. Now we can find out if these guys can stay together, and go somewhere new.&quot;

ShakingThrough.net rated it as three and a half stars, although it said, &quot;&quot;Contraband&quot;, the debut result of said pairing, never does transmute its elements into something new and exciting. Mostly, it sounds like no more and a little less than one might hope for from such a union.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B−, saying, &quot;[E]ven at its sharpest, &quot;Contraband&quot; feels secondhand, and much of it is also hobbled by a disconnect between singer and band.&quot;

Allmusic rated it as three stars out of five, saying, &quot;With &quot;Contraband&quot;, Velvet Revolver has pulled off something tidy, fashioning music that manages both hedonism and maturity. It upholds legacies while grading a new route.&quot; Best tracks: &quot;Big Machine&quot;, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; &quot;Slither&quot;

&quot;Blender&quot; said it was &quot;A showcase for Weiland&#x27;s vocals&quot;. &quot;Playlouder&quot; rated it as three candles out of five saying it sounded more like Stone Temple Pilots and &quot;anyone who&#x27;d hoped for Guns N&#x27; Roses mark II (or III) will be very seriously disappointed.&quot; Best track &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Contraband&quot; was ranked number 317 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Contraband&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 256,000 copies in its first week of release. Notably, this marked the best-ever debut for a new rock artist in the SoundScan era. The album would eventually sell over 2.9 million copies in the United States, and 4 million worldwide.

The first single, &quot;Slither&quot;, topped a composite world modern rock chart in June, and later hit No. 1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart for 8 weeks. The follow-up, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, was a major crossover hit that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart for 11 weeks.

In 2005, Velvet Revolver won the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance, an award Weiland had previously won for the Stone Temple Pilots song &quot;Plush&quot; in 1994. At the ceremony, they were asked to play the music for a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. The live recording was a hit on iTunes, with all proceeds going to charity. In January 2005, Velvet Revolver were also asked to play the music for a cover of Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;. The single was to aid victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, with all proceeds going to Save the Children Foundation.

<doc id="692334" wikidata="Q601307" url="?curid=692334" title="Athol Fugard">
<text>Athol Fugard OIS, HonFRSL (born 11 June 1932) is a South African playwright, novelist, actor, and director widely regarded as South Africa&#x27;s greatest playwright. He is best known for his political and penetrating plays opposing the system of apartheid. Some of these have also been adapted for film.

His novel &quot;Tsotsi&quot; was adapted as a film of the same name and won an Academy Award in 2005. It was directed by Gavin Hood.

Acclaimed in 1985 as &quot;the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;, Fugard continues to write. He has published more than thirty plays.

Fugard also served as an adjunct professor of playwriting, acting and directing in the Department of Theatre and Dance at the University of California, San Diego.

He has received many awards, honours, and honorary degrees, including the 2005 Order of Ikhamanga in Silver from the government of South Africa &quot;for his excellent contribution and achievements in the theatre&quot;. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

Fugard was honoured in Cape Town with the opening in 2010 of the Fugard Theatre in District Six. He received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Fugard was born as Harold Athol Lanigan Fugard, in Middelburg, Eastern Cape, South Africa, on 11 June 1932. His mother, Marrie (née Potgieter), an Afrikaner, operated a general store and then a lodging house; his father, Harold Fugard, of Irish, English and French Huguenot descent, was a former jazz pianist who had become disabled.

In 1935, his family moved to Port Elizabeth. In 1938, he began attending primary school at Marist Brothers College. After being awarded a scholarship, Fugard enrolled at a local technical college for secondary education. He studied Philosophy and Social Anthropology at the University of Cape Town, but he dropped out of the university in 1953, a few months before final examinations.

==Early career, marriage and family==
He left home, hitchhiked to North Africa with a friend, and spent the next two years working in east Asia on a steamer ship, the . During this time he began writing, and he &quot;celebrated&quot; these early times in his 1999 autobiographical play &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Tiger: a memoir for the stage&quot;.

In September 1956, he married Sheila Meiring, a University of Cape Town Drama School student whom he had met the previous year. Now known as Sheila Fugard, she is a novelist and poet. Their daughter Lisa Fugard is a novelist.

In 1958, the Fugards moved to Johannesburg, where he worked as a clerk in a Native Commissioners&#x27; Court. He became &quot;keenly aware of the injustices of apartheid.&quot; His good friendship with prominent local anti-apartheid figures had a profound influence on Fugard. His plays&#x27; political expression brought him into conflict with the national government; to avoid prosecution, he had his plays produced and published outside South Africa. Fugard struggled with alcohol for a time but has been a teetotaler since the early 1980s.

For several years in the late 20th century, Fugard lived in San Diego, California, where he taught as an adjunct professor of playwriting, acting, and directing in the Department of Theatre and Dance at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). For the academic year 2000–2001, he taught at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana as the IU Class of 1963 Wells Scholar Professor.

In 2012, Fugard returned again to South Africa, where he now lives permanently.

In 2015, after almost 60 years of marriage, the Fugards divorced. In 2016, in New York City Hall, Fugard married Paula Fourie, a younger South African writer and academic. Fugard and Fourie live in the Cape Winelands region of South Africa with their daughter, Halle Fugard Fourie.

==Career==

===Early period===
In 1958, Fugard organised &quot;a multiracial theatre for which he wrote, directed, and acted&quot;, writing and producing several plays for it, including &quot;No-Good Friday&quot; (1958) and &quot;Nongogo&quot; (1959), in which he and his colleague, black South African actor Zakes Mokae performed. In 1978, Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized &quot;Nongogo&quot; as &quot;awkward and thin. It is unable to communicate very much about its characters, or make them much more than the servants of a noticeably ticking plot.&quot; Eder said, &quot;Queenie is the most real of the characters. Her sense of herself and where she wants to go makes her believable and the crumbling of her dour defenses at a touch of hope makes her affecting. By contrast, Johnny is unreal. His warmth and hopefulness at the start crumble too suddenly and too completely&quot;.

After returning to Port Elizabeth in the early 1960s, Athol and Sheila Fugard started The Circle Players, which derives its name from the production of &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; by Bertolt Brecht.

In 1961, in Johannesburg, Fugard and Mokae starred as the brothers Morris and Zachariah in the single-performance world première of Fugard&#x27;s play &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; (revised and retitled &quot;Blood Knot&quot; in 1987), directed by Barney Simon. In 1989, Lloyd Richards of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; declared &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; to be Fugard&#x27;s first &quot;major play&quot;.

===Refusal to stage for &quot;Whites Only&quot; audiences===
In 1962, Fugard found the question of whether he could &quot;work in a theatre which excludes &#x27;Non-Whites&#x27;--or includes them only on the basis of special segregated performance-- increasingly pressing&quot;. It was made more so by the decision of British Equity to prevent any British entertainer visiting South Africa unless the audiences were allowed to be multi-racial. In a decision that caused him to reflect on the power of art to effect change, Fugard decided that the &quot;answer must be No&quot; to segregation.

That old argument used to be so comforting; so plausible: &#x27;One person in that segregated, white audience, might be moved to think, and then to change, by what he saw&#x27;. 
I&#x27;m beginning to wonder whether it really works that way. The supposition seems to be that there is a didactic--a teaching through feeling element in art. What I do know is that art can give meaning, can render meaningful areas of experience, and most certainly also enhances. But teach? Contradict? State the opposite to what you believe and then lead you to accept it?
In other words, can art change a man or woman? No. That is what life does. Art is no substitute for life.
Of the few venues in the country where a play could be presented to mixed audiences, Fugard noted that some were little better than barns. But he concluded that under these circumstances, &quot;every conceivable dignity--audience, producer, act, &#x27;professional&#x27; etc.--&quot; was &quot;operative&quot; in the white theatre except one, &quot;human dignity&quot;.

Fugard publicly supported the Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959–94) in the international boycott of South African theatres due to their segregated audiences. The results were additional restrictions and surveillance. He had his plays published and produced outside South Africa.

Lucille Lortel produced &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; at the Cricket Theatre, Off Broadway, in New York City in 1964, &quot;launch[ing]&quot; Fugard&#x27;s &quot;American career.&quot;

===The Serpent Players===
In the 1960s, Fugard formed the Serpent Players, whose name derives from its first venue, the former snake pit (hence the name) at the Port Elizabeth Museum, &quot;a group of black actors worker-players who earned their living as teachers, clerks, and industrial workers, and cannot thus be considered amateurs in the manner of leisured whites&quot;, developing and performing plays &quot;under surveillance by the Security Police&quot;, according to Loren Kruger&#x27;s &quot;The Dis-illusion of Apartheid&quot;, published in 2004. The group largely consisted of black men, including Winston Ntshona, John Kani, Welcome Duru, Fats Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man who grew up in Port Elizabeth and who recently returned from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them &quot;as he had the know-how theatrically—the tricks, how to use the stage, movements, everything&quot;; they worked with Athol Fugard since then, &quot;and that is how the Serpent Players got together.&quot; At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included Bertolt Brecht, August Strindberg, Samuel Beckett, William Shakespeare and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in California, Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: &quot;We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to take a look at our play and our work...We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That&#x27;s it. Other attributes are merely labels.&quot; They mainly performed at the St Stephen&#x27;s Hall – renamed the Douglas Ngange Mbopa Memorial Hall in 2013 – adjacent to St Stephen&#x27;s Church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth.

According to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago, 
the Serpent Players used Brecht&#x27;s elucidation of gestic acting, dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African vaudeville, to explore the theatrical force of Brecht&#x27;s techniques, as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the &quot;Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; and, a year later, on &quot;Antigone&quot; led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still [2004] South Africa&#x27;s most distinctive &quot;Lehrstück&quot; [learning play]:&quot;The Coat&quot;. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, &quot;The Coat&quot; dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.

Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned &quot;People Are Living There&quot; (1969) in 1971, arguing: &quot;There are splinters of realities here, and pregnancies of feeling, hut [sic] nothing of significance emerges. In Mr. Fugard&#x27;s earlier plays he seemed to be dealing with life at a proper level of humanity. Here—if real people are living there—they remain oddly quiet about it...The first act rambles disconsolately, like a lonely type writer looking for a subject and the second act produces with pride a birthday party of Chaplinesque bathos but less than Chaplinesque invention and spirit..[The characters] harangue one another in an awkward dislocation between a formal speech and an interior monologue.&quot; Mark Blankenship of &quot;Variety&quot; negatively reviewed a 2005 revival of the same work, writing that it &quot;lacks the emotional intensity and theatrical imagination that mark such Fugard favorites&quot; as &quot;&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys&quot;. Blankenship also stated, however, that the performance he attended featuring &quot;only haphazard sketches of plot and character&quot; was perhaps the result of Fugard allowing director Suzanne Shepard to revise the play without showing him the changes.

The Serpent Players conceptualised and co-authored many plays that it performed for a variety of audiences in many theatres around the world. The following are some of its notable and most popular plays:

* Its first production was Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;La Mandragola&quot;, directed by Fugard as &quot;The Cure&quot; and set in the township. Other productions include Georg Buchner&#x27;s &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; and Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;. When the group had turned to improvisation, they came up with classic works such as &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot;, emerging as inner experiences of the actors who are also the co-authors of the plays.
* In &quot;The Coat&quot;, Kruger observes, &quot;The participants were engaged not only in representing social relationships on stage but also on enacting and revising their own dealings with each other and with institutions of apartheid oppression from the law courts downward&quot;, and &quot;this engagement testified to the real power of Brecht&#x27;s apparently utopian plan to abolish the separation of player and audience and to make of each player a &#x27;statesman&#x27; or social actor...Work on &quot;The Coat&quot; led indirectly to the Serpent Players&#x27; most famous and most Brechtian productions: &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Island&quot; (1973).&quot;
Fugard developed these two plays for the Serpent Players in workshops, working with John Kani and Winston Ntshona, publishing them in 1974 with his own play &quot;Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act&quot; (1972). The authorities considered the title of &quot;The Island&quot;, which alludes to Robben Island, the prison where Nelson Mandela was being held, too controversial, so Fugard and the Serpent Players used the alternative title &quot;The Hodoshe Span&quot; (&quot;Hodoshe&quot; meaning &quot;carrion fly&quot; in Xhosa).
* These plays &quot;espoused a Brechtian attention to the demonstration of gest and social situations and encouraged audiences to analyze rather than merely applaud the action&quot;; for example, &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, which infused a Brechtian critique and vaudevillian irony-–especially in Kani&#x27;s virtuoso improvisation-–even provoked an African audience&#x27;s critical interruption and interrogation of the action. 
* While dramatising frustrations in the lives of his audience members, the plays simultaneously drew them into the action and attempted to have them analyse the situations of the characters in Brechtian fashion, according to Kruger.
* &quot;Blood Knot&quot; was filmed by the BBC in 1967, with Fugard&#x27;s collaboration, starring the Jamaican actor Charles Hyatt as Zachariah and Fugard himself as Morris, as in the original 1961 première in Johannesburg. Less pleased than Fugard, the South African government of B.J. Vorster confiscated Fugard&#x27;s passport.

Fugard&#x27;s play &quot;A Lesson from Aloes&quot; (1978) was described as one of his major works by Alvin Klein of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, though others have written more lukewarm reviews.

===Yale Rep premieres, 1980s===

&quot;&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys&quot;, written in 1982, incorporates &quot;strong autobiographical matter&quot;; nonetheless &quot;it is fiction, not memoir&quot;, as &quot;&quot; and some of Fugard&#x27;s other works are subtitled. The play deals with the relationship between a 17-year-old white South African and two African men who work for the white youth&#x27;s family. Its world premiere was performed by Danny Glover, Željko Ivanek and Zakes Mokae, at the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, in March 1982.

&quot;The Road to Mecca&quot; was presented at the Yale Repertory Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut, in May 1984. Directed by Fugard, the cast starred Carmen Mathews, Marianne Owen, and Tom Aldredge. Along with &quot;Master Harold&quot;, it proved to be one of Fugard&#x27;s most acclaimed works. It is the story of an elderly recluse in a small South African town who has spent 15 years on an obsessive artistic project.

Fugard appeared in his &quot;A Place With the Pigs&quot; at the Yale Rep in New Haven CT, in 1987. Inspired by the true story of World War II Soviet deserter, Fugard plays a paranoid who spent four decades hiding with his pigs. As with &quot;The Road to Mecca&quot;, Fugards critics readily appreciated the metaphor for a life of internal exile.

=== Post-apartheid plays ===
The first play that Fugard wrote after the end of apartheid, &quot;Valley Song&quot;, was premiered in Johannesburg, in August, 1995, with Fugard in the role of both a white, and of a coloured, farmer. While they dispute property titles, both share a reverence for the land and fear change. In October 1995, Fugard took the play to the United States with a production by the Manhattan Theatre Club at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey.

In January 2009, Fugard returned to New Haven for the premiere in the &quot;Coming Home.&quot; Veronika, the granddaughter of Buk, the coloured farmer in &quot;Valley Song&quot;, leaves the Karoo to pursue a singing career in Cape Town but then returns, after his death, to create a new life on the land for her young son.

The Fugard Theatre, in the District Six area of Cape Town opened with performances by the Isango Portobello theatre company in February 2010 and a new play written and directed by Athol Fugard, &quot;The Train Driver&quot;, played at the theatre in March 2010.

In April 2014, returned to the stage in the world premiere of his &quot;The Shadow of a Hummingbird&quot; at the Long Wharf Theatre, New Haven. This short play was performed with an &quot;introductory scene&quot; compiled by Paula Fourie from Fugard&#x27;s journal writings. With &quot;the playwright digging through these diaries on a set which resembles an old, busy writer&#x27;s workspace&quot;, the scene blends into the main play, which begins when Boba, the grandson of the story-telling grandfather character Oupa (played by Fugard) comes to visit.

=== Film ===
Fugard&#x27;s plays are produced internationally and have won multiple awards, and several have been made into films (see &quot;Filmography&quot; below). Fugard himself performed in the first of these, as Boesman alongside Yvonne Bryceland as Lena, in &quot;Boesman and Lena&quot; directed by Ross Devenish in 1973.

His film debut as a director occurred in 1992, when he co-directed the adaptation of his play &quot;The Road to Mecca&quot; with Peter Goldsmid, who also wrote the screenplay. The film adaptation of his novel &quot;Tsotsi&quot;, written and directed by Gavin Hood, won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006.

Outside of his own work, Fugard has a number of cameo film roles, most notably as General Smuts in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), and as Doctor Sundesval in Sydney Schanberg&#x27;s &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984).

<doc id="692345" wikidata="Q3622170" url="?curid=692345" title="Fictional currency">
<text>A fictional currency is some form of system of money defined, depicted, or alluded to, in works of fiction, such as novels, films or video games. The names of units of such currency are sometimes based on extant or historic currencies (e.g. &quot;Altairian dollars&quot; or &quot;Earth yen&quot;) while other names, such as &quot;Kalganids&quot; in Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series, may be wholly invented. A particularly common type, especially in science fiction, is electronically managed &quot;credits&quot;. In some works of fiction, exchange media other than money are used. These are not currency as such, but rather nonstandard media of exchange used to avoid the difficulties of ensuring &quot;double coincidence of wants&quot; in a barter system.

==Concept and creation==
Authors doing worldbuilding and creating imaginary societies have to take care when naming fictional currencies because of the associations between currency names and countries; recognizable names for currencies of the future (e.g. dollar or yen) may be used to imply how history has progressed, but would appear out of place in an entirely alien civilization. Historical fiction may need research. Writers need not explain the exact value of their fictional currencies or provide an exchange rate to modern money; they may rely on the intuitive grasp of their readers, for instance that one currency unit is probably of little value, but that millions of units will be worth a lot.

Currencies in science fiction face particular problems due to futuristic technology allowing matter replication and hence forgery. Authors have proposed currencies that are incapable of replication such as the non-replicable &quot;latinum&quot; used by the Ferengi in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, or the currency in &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Millions&quot; by George O. Smith, which is booby-trapped to explode if scanned by a replicating machine. Money in fantasy fiction faces analogous challenges from the use of magic; in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J. K. Rowling, magically created currency is time-limited, while in Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s fictional realm of &quot;Earthsea&quot;, the world&#x27;s equilibrium is unbalanced when something is created from nothing.

In the &quot;Demon Princes&quot; pentalogy by Jack Vance the currency &quot;SVU&quot; or Standard Value Unit was described as being employed on most major settled worlds and as having a value equivalent to one hour of unskilled labor in standardized conditions. Its printed notes were verifiable by scanning with a device called a &quot;fake meter&quot;, the function of which comprised a critical theme of the second book in the series, &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;. The protagonist undermines the system and prints 10 billion SVU undetectable by the fake meter, thus setting the stage for three books to follow.

The long-term value of currency is an issue in works featuring journeys through time or the lapse of very long periods (for instance due to the deep sleep or cryopreservation of the protagonists). In some cases, compound interest may swell small amounts into a fortune, as happens in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; by H. G. Wells, and the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;A Fishful of Dollars&quot;. In other stories, inflation reduces the value of money, as in &quot;The Age of the Pussyfoot&quot; by Frederik Pohl. Other plot factors can affect the worth of currency: for instance, in &quot;The Moon Metal&quot; by Garrett P. Serviss the world&#x27;s currency standard must be switched from gold to a mysterious new chemical, &quot;artemisium&quot;, after the discovery of vast mineral deposits in the Antarctic devalues all known precious metals.

While modern fiat currencies lack intrinsic worth, some fictional currencies are designed to be valuable in their own right. Intrinsically valuable currencies are used in the Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; universe; the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; world of Krynn where steel coins are the primary currency and are more valuable than gold by weight; and the &quot;Apprentice Adept&quot; series by Piers Anthony. The space opera &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; by Iain M. Banks features coins convertible for chemical elements, land, or computers. In utopian fiction, a money-free economy may still need a unit of exchange: in &quot;The Great Explosion&quot; by Eric Frank Russell, the Gands use favor-exchange based on &quot;obs&quot; (obligations).

==Trends in depictions==

The use of &quot;credits&quot; is particularly common in futuristic settings, so much so that Sam Humphries has pointed it out as a cliché: &quot;In any science-fiction movie, anywhere in the galaxy, currency is referred to as &#x27;credits. Credits are frequently envisioned as a form of electronic money.

In science fiction set in the near future, modern currency names are often used. The selection of familiar currencies such as the dollar or yen, particularly in the far future, may be used to make suggestions about the way history unfolded; however, it would seem strange for aliens to use a recognizable currency.

<doc id="692352" wikidata="Q1966390" url="?curid=692352" title="Sleepwalker (comics)">
<text>Sleepwalker is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Bob Budiansky and Bret Blevins, he first appeared in &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; #1 (June 1991). The character is named after his race and is the star of a self-titled comic book which ran for 33 issues, from June 1991 to February 1994, with one &quot;Holiday Special&quot;. All but two of the issues were written by Budiansky, with Tom Brevoort and Mike Kanterovich writing the &quot;Holiday Special&quot; and one fill-in issue. Dan Slott also contributed a humorous side story in issue #25.

==Creation==
Bob Budiansky spoke on the creation of the character saying, 

&quot;The idea what would become Sleepwalker first sparked within me during one of the weekly editorial meetings I attended when I was a Marvel editor and which were chaired by former Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter... Among the things talked about was how, in the real world, Superman would be treated by the nations of earth if he actually existed. He said that rather than being welcomed by most nations of the earth as a hero because of his good deeds and good looks, nations would instead unite to figure out how to defend themselves against and, if necessary, defeat this near-omnipotent alien being... And so the thought occurred to me that simply because Superman happens to look like the stereotypical all-American male of that era, people have no hesitation to accept him as the hero he is despite the fact that it&#x27;s common knowledge he&#x27;s an alien. But what if he is still heroic and looks like a true alien - a creature that doesn&#x27;t look like us, and, in fact, appears repellant to us? How would humans react to him if that&#x27;s how Superman looks? So Sleepwalker began as the anti-Superman, instead of an alien who just happens to look like the perfect human. I made him an alien who is a green-skinned bug-eyed monster, at least to our eyes. And he&#x27;s heroic. At first, I wanted to name my character Alien. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that Alien was a poor choice because it had already been used for the 1979 movie of the same name, which is probably the reason others mistakenly think I came up with the [Sleepwalker] idea in the 1970s&quot;.

In regard to his idea of the concept of Sleepwalker, Budiansky stated &quot;I came up with the name Sleepwalker and tied his origin and abilities to dreams, which was an interest of mine. Instead of coming from an alien planet, like Superman, Sleepwalker would come from an alien dimension. I began writing the backstory for Sleepwalker and sketching out his look probably around 1989&quot;.

==Publication history==
A second Sleepwalker character was planned to receive a self-titled series by Robert Kirkman in 2004, but instead debuted in the 2004 &quot;Epic Anthology&quot;, which was cancelled after one issue. The original Sleepwalker&#x27;s next appearance was in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; vol. 3 #15, nearly a decade after his original cancellation.

At the end of 2018, as a tie-in to the Marvel Infinity Wars event, a four-issue Sleepwalker miniseries was released. The series is written by Chad Bowers and Chris Sims, with artwork by Todd Nauck.

In 2017, Rich Johnston of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; addressed persistent rumors that Tom DeFalco (at the time, Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief) had described Sleepwalker as &quot;&quot;Sandman&quot; done right&quot;. After researching the phrase, the most Johnston was able to find was &quot;mention of a press release that described &quot;[Sleepwalker]&quot; as ″&quot;Sandman&quot; done the Marvel way;&#x27;&quot; however, this was &quot;only a reference, never an actual quoted piece&quot;. Johnston posited that the rumor&#x27;s source may have been a parody of earlier Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter.

==Fictional character biography==

The Sleepwalkers are entities from the Mindscape, a dimension that borders on the minds of all living things, and work to protect the world from the dangerous creatures that inhabit it. One Sleepwalker was trapped in the mind of college student Rick Sheridan by his archenemy Cobweb. He is able to communicate with Rick via dreams and can manifest in the real world while he sleeps.

Rick and Sleepwalker eventually worked out an understanding, allowing the latter to fight crime and various injustices. This was not easy, as Sleepwalker&#x27;s appearance caused fear among regular people.

With Spider-Man, Sleepwalker battled Kingpin and Crimewave. With Darkhawk, Deathlok, Moon Knight, and the Squadron Supreme, he attempted to stop Eon&#x27;s body from invading Earth&#x27;s Universe. He also battled the Chain Gang. With Deathlok&#x27;s help, he rescued Alyssa Conover and a number of other innocent people from being experimented on by the mysterious Mr. FX. He fought Nightmare, and then battled Spectra. Alongside Mister Fantastic and the Thing, he battled the Thought Police. Alongside Darkhawk and Spider-Man, Sleepwalker saved Portal from the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He also battled various supernatural menaces, including a demonic genie known as Mr. Jyn and the spirit of a traumatized young man that had gained superhuman powers and became obsessed with recreating the scene of his mother&#x27;s murder

Sleepwalker is one of the few entities who remember the events of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; storyline. Sleepwalker spent most of it fighting the villains called the Chain Gang and rescuing people from natural disasters. However, Nebula turned back time, neutralizing what he had gone through. He considers his vague memories to be just a dream.

Sleepwalker played an important role in the &quot;Infinity War&quot;, helping to defeat the forces of the Magus by channeling mental powers from Professor X, Jean Grey, Psylocke and Moondragon through Rick Sheridan&#x27;s mind. He also contributed to the battle against the evil clones of the superheroes Beast, Firestar and Daredevil. Part of the fight against the evil doubles involved Sleepwalker impersonating his own evil clone.

In the &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot; storyline, Sleepwalker is brainwashed by the Goddess and taken to a planet on the other side of the sun. He keeps Rick asleep by drugging the orange juice in his refrigerator. During the battle between the Goddess&#x27;s forces and the rest of Earth&#x27;s heroes, Sleepwalker subdues Darkhawk and the Human Torch by dragging them into the water with his shape-changing powers.

Sleepwalker exchanged bodies with Rick Sheridan and battled Cobweb, the Chain Gang, 8-Ball and the Hobgoblin. Later in the series, Sleepwalker is revealed to supposedly be the lead scout for the dimension conquering Mindspawn race, an invasion force from the Mindscape intent on conquering Earth. However, in actuality, Cobweb had put in motion a complicated plot to invade the Earth and disrupt Rick&#x27;s relationship with Sleepwalker. This involves disguising his minions as members of Sleepwalker&#x27;s race and framing his archenemy as their leader. The plot is only partially successful; Sleepwalker and the Avengers thwart the initial attack, although Sleepwalker&#x27;s reputation was ruined in the process. Many people still mistakenly believe that Sleepwalker&#x27;s race planned to invade and conquer the Earth and that Sleepwalker was an advanced scout for them.

During the confrontation, Sleepwalker pretended to destroy Rick&#x27;s mind as a means of protecting him from Cobweb&#x27;s minions. Unfortunately, the authorities retrieved the &quot;mindrake&quot; weapon Sleepwalker had used to store Rick&#x27;s mind, preventing the alien from recovering it, also gathering up one of Cobweb&#x27;s demons that was left behind after the Avengers drove them away. The demon and the mindrake were both taken to a federal prison and research facility where serial killer Jeremy Roscoe was also being held as part of a psychiatric experiment. Roscoe staged an escape from the prison hospital and became fused with the demon in the process, transforming into a nightmarish creature calling himself Psyko. The monster began spreading mass insanity across New York, until Sleepwalker managed to defeat him and retrieve the mindrake Psyko had taken with him.

Later, Sleepwalker thwarts Cobweb&#x27;s second attack and banishes his archenemy once and for all, before seemingly dying to save Rick Sheridan&#x27;s life. However, Sleepwalker would later turn up alive and still trapped in Rick&#x27;s mind.

Sleepwalker eventually gains the ability to interact with the real world again. He is seen investigating the after-effects of an explosion caused by the villainous Ringmaster. He had attempted to become more involved in the situation but was foiled by Rick&#x27;s sleeping schedule.

Sleepwalker is seen as having become a registered superhuman under the &quot;Initiative&quot; after Alyssa Conover&#x27;s death in an auto accident. He then appears alongside Machine Man and Agent Sum as a member of Ms. Marvel&#x27;s Operation: Lightning Storm (by default, his human host Rick Sheridan becomes an unofficial member as well).

During the Fantastic Four&#x27;s confrontation with the Quiet Man, they recruited Sleepwalker&#x27;s assistance to neutralize the threat posed by the heroes from Counter-Earth, reasoning that Sleepwalker was particularly suited to advise them on it, since Counter-Earth was basically Franklin Richards&#x27; dream. During his time on Counter-Earth, Sleepwalker noted that none of the human inhabitants there were real, as they did not have actual souls, allowing the FF to freely take them out, as they were not actually killing anyone.

==Powers and abilities==
Sleepwalker possesses superhuman physical abilities and flight, as well as a &quot;warp gaze&quot; that enables him to modify the shape and physical characteristics of other objects. He avoids using it on living beings as it would cause immense pain.

As an alien resident of the Mindscape, Sleepwalker has exceptional visual abilities, being able to see over a much farther distance than an average human and sense energy trails. Due to his bond with Rick Sheridan, Sleepwalker shares a mental link with him and must periodically return to his mind to survive. He can also enhance psychic abilities and possesses a limited resistance to them.

Sleepwalker used the Imaginator, an amulet-like device that can teleport himself and others, and imprison the creatures of the Mindscape.

In &quot;Infinity Wars&quot;, Sleepwalker discovers that he can harness the power of the Infinity Gems without having to use them directly.

==Enemies==
Sleepwalker possessed a colorful gallery of mostly original villains, with a new one introduced each issue during the title&#x27;s beginnings. They include:

* Jeff Hagees / 8-Ball: A criminal who based his costume and equipment on the game of pool.
* Nelson Gruber / Bookworm: An angry social misfit who, after an encounter with Sleepwalker, gained the ability to channel energy from the Mindscape into creations of whatever he read. He used his abilities to get revenge on his tormentors.
* The Chain Gang: Four convicted felons linked together in a chain gang who escaped during the upheavals caused by the Infinity Gauntlet, gaining superhuman powers that lasted only as long as they stayed chained together. It consists of Master Link (Willis Hayworth), Missing Link (Ray Morgan), Uplink (Hector Fuentes), and Weak Link (Ernest Mills).
* Mr. FX: A mysterious special effects designer who was known for his stunningly lifelike displays, which he achieved by kidnapping people and imprisoning them within specially designed costumes.
* Nightmare: Sleepwalker faced off against this living embodiment of bad dreams, usually a Doctor Strange villain. Nightmare promised the reward of sending Sleepwalker back to his home realm, but Sleepwalker fought back when Nightmare threatened Rick Sheridan.
* Selena Slate / Spectra: The assistant of a scientist who was studying the properties of a strange diamond, and planned to steal it and split the proceeds with her junkie boyfriend. After being imbued with the diamond&#x27;s powers, she gained the ability to manipulate multicolored lights with various effects.
* Mr. Jyn: A demonic genie who tricked humans into letting him manifest on Earth by pretending to serve them, even as he manipulated them into letting him cause mayhem until he would be released.
* Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Cicala: A young boy traumatized by his father murdering his mother, who became catatonic before his mind made contact with a malign energy force from the Mindscape, which allowed him to possess others.
* Cobweb: Sleepwalker&#x27;s nemesis, a demon of the Mindscape who can cause madness in others. Cobweb trapped Sleepwalker in Rick Sheridan&#x27;s mind as part of a plot to invade Earth without being thwarted by his enemy.
* Felicity Hopkins / Lullaby: A teenage mutant who can place others in zombie-like trances through song.
* Carl Wilkinson / Crimewave: A crime boss who plotted to embarrass the Kingpin and replace him as the top crime lord on the East Coast, by capturing Spider-Man.
* The Thought Police: A special team of government agents assembled to capture Sleepwalker, led by the obsessed Agent Tolliver Smith.
* Jeremy Roscoe / Psyko: A human serial killer who became fused with a monster from the Mindscape and transformed into a hideous creature with warping powers similar to Sleepwalker&#x27;s and the additional power to cause insanity.
Sleepwalker&#x27;s original villains largely stopped appearing since the end of his series, save for 8-Ball who appeared briefly in the 2005 &quot;She-Hulk&quot; series and the &quot;Daughters of the Dragon&quot; miniseries.

Sleepwalker also battled the Hobgoblin and teamed up with Darkhawk and Spider-Man to battle the Brotherhood of Mutants to rescue the mutant Portal.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers&quot;===
Sleepwalker features in an arc of Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; vol. 3, featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed &quot;The League of Losers&quot;. A group of heroes including Sleepwalker, Darkhawk, Dagger, Araña, X-23, Gravity, and Terror go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing Reed Richards&#x27; time machine, (Chronok comes to the present after killing all of Marvel&#x27;s major heroes). Although Araña dies along the way, the rest of the team succeeds.

It is revealed Chronok is from the same time period as Kirkman&#x27;s Mutant 2099; the group stays with him and his mentor Reed Richards to wait for Chronok. During this time, Sleepwalker experiences difficulties with being away from his host Rick Sheridan, but ultimately comes to terms with it. The team defeats Chronok, but at the end of the story, Richards reveals they can&#x27;t go back to their present, due to time travel and alternate timelines. The group decides to stay in the future, satisfied with the impact they made, however unnoticed. Mutant 2099 suggests reforming the Avengers or the &quot;Fantastic Nine&quot;.

Note that due to the Marvel Universe&#x27;s method for resolving time travel paradoxes, this story occurred in an alternate universe.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;===
Sleepwalker is shown among the surviving heroes in the &quot;Dead Days&quot; prequel to &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;, during the meeting on the Helicarrier. This is the last time he is seen however, and Rick&#x27;s sleeping body is killed.

===&quot;Ultimate Sleepwalker&quot;===
Ultimate Sleepwalker was seen in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #89 (February 2008); there, he is shown to be not one man, but a group of creatures that police the &quot;mindscape&quot; on which Amahl Farouk grew to become the Shadow King.

===&quot;The Wozuans&quot;===
&quot;The Anatomy of a Nightmare&quot; in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #22 (Oct. 1961) by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko features an alien race bearing a strong resemblance to the Sleepwalkers. The story was reprinted in &quot;Monsters on the Prowl&quot; #18 (Aug. 1972). The main character was hidden in shadows and takes pills to give him nightmares; his appearance is revealed to be the same as the aliens he visits, the Wozuans. He is finally revealed to be a green-skinned alien complaining that the pills failed to show him anything other than his own world.

==Other appearances==
*He was seen briefly in a six issue Spider-Man miniseries, &quot;Revenge of the Sinister Six&quot;.
*Sleepwalker appears in the preview image for &quot;&quot; #1.
* Sleepwalker appeared in &quot;Secret Defenders&quot; #4, #5, fighting Roadkill
* As part of the Infinity Wars, Sleepwalker had a cameo in &quot;Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme&quot; #46
* As well as appearing in the main Infinity Crusade series, Sleepwalker had a cameo in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #464
* Two creatures slightly resembling Sleepwalker appear in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #89. It is revealed they are &quot;policing&quot; the mindscape reality Amahl Farouk (the Shadow King) finds himself trapped in with an iron hand, causing more trouble than actually protecting it.
*Sleepwalker can be seen on the cover of the &quot;Irredeemable Ant-Man&quot; #12. This final issue of the canceled series, shows other characters doomed to obscurity.
* Sleepwalker teams up with the Superior Spider-Man in &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; #19.

<doc id="692353" wikidata="Q1162079" url="?curid=692353" title="Mount Baw Baw">
<text>Mount Baw Baw () is a mountain summit on the Baw-Baw Plateau of the Great Dividing Range, located in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The name is from the Yarra-Yallou, Gunna-Kurnai people of Gippsland. It is of uncertain meaning, but possibly signifies, &quot;echo&quot;, or &quot;ghost&quot;.

The Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort is an unincorporated area, that includes the Mt Baw Baw summit, which is under the direct administration of the government of Victoria, and is surrounded by the Baw Baw National Park, in the Shire of Baw Baw.

==Location==
Mount Baw Baw is about east of Melbourne, on the north side the Latrobe Valley, due North of Moe. Mount Baw Baw itself is one of a number of peaks on the Baw Baw Plateau, a long plateau tending about 20 km north-east and is about 10 km wide. Other peaks on the plateau include Mount Mueller, Mount Whitelaw, Talbot Peak, Mount St Phillack, Mount Tyers, Mount Kernot and Mount St Gwinear. The plateau itself is isolated from most of Victoria&#x27;s high country by the deep valleys of the Thomson and Aberfeldy rivers and tributaries of the La Trobe River, including the Tanjil and Tyers rivers to the south.

==Geology and biology==
The Baw Baw massif consists of a late Devonian granodiorite pluton. There is relatively little relief on the plateau itself, the highest point reaching . The lower slopes of the plateau are covered in montane eucalypt forest and tall forest, and creek valleys have cool temperate rainforest of myrtle beech, &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot;. Above snow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;) woodland occurs. There is no altitudinal treeline limit; subalpine grasslands and shrublands occur in flat valley bottoms on the plateau as a result of cold-air drainage. Much of this subalpine zone is included in the Baw Baw National Park. The Baw Baw Village ski resort is technically outside the national park.

The climate of the plateau itself is subalpine, with an average annual precipitation of . Snow covers the plateau from June to September.

It is thought that Baron Ferdinand von Mueller made the first recorded European ascent of Baw Baw in 1860, naming Christmas Creek on one of his major collecting expeditions. It was on this trip that he collected the Baw Baw Berry, &quot;Wittsteinia vacciniacea&quot;. There are two routes up the mountain; one via Noojee and Icy Creek which is very winding, and the unsealed South Face Road via Erica.

Mount Baw Baw is home to the critically endangered Baw Baw Frog.

==Climate==
Mount Baw Baw has a Subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;). The mountain summit receives more annual precipitation than most places in mainland Australia, with frequent and heavy snow between May and October but can occur at any time of the year (as well as a persistent snowpack). Frequent, heavy cloud cover and strong winds mean that minimum temperatures rarely drop below , whereas maximum temperatures are frequently at or below ; the mountain is often shrouded in low cloud or mist in winter, thereby reducing diurnal range. The mean afternoon humidity of 80%, is extreme (especially for a mainland Australian region).

Summers are cool with temperatures rarely rising above ; summers can also be very cold, with a maximum temperature of just recorded on 25 December 2006, and on both 11 January 2012 and 16 February 1998. During the 2009 Victorian heatwave most of the state saw highs of above , while the temperature on Mount Baw Baw&#x27;s summit reached a comparatively cool maximum of just .

==Ski resort==
The summit is located within the boundaries of the Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort, an unincorporated area of Victoria. There are about of mainly beginner-intermediate ski runs. Seven lifts service a variety of runs, with the highest going almost to the top of Mount Baw Baw with a rise. The resort village is at the bottom of the lifts, offering ski in-ski out access. In addition to the downhill runs there are a number of cross country trails offering access to other parts of the Baw Baw plateau. Like most lower-lying Australian ski resorts, snow cover varies greatly from year to year, but is regularly available for the local ski season from about July to the end of September.

The alpine resort village has modern facilities and caters for both day-trippers and long-term visitors, with accommodation, ski hire, food outlets, medical and information centres all within walking distance of the car parks.

==Walking==
During the summer months, Mt Baw Baw is popular for hiking and bushwalking given its location in the Baw Baw National Park. The alpine grasses are blanketed with wildflowers and walks at a higher elevation pass through snow gum forest.

Popular walks include the Great Walhalla Alpine Trail, which starts at the gold mining town of Walhalla and finishes at the Mt Baw Baw Alpine Resort. The hike is the first of the Australian Alps Walking Track. The Mt Baw Baw Summit Walk arrives at the highest peak of the Baw Baw plateau, elevation 1564m. Situated at the summit is the historic cairn used as a survey reference in 1903.

==Cycling==
The access road to the resort, the Mount Baw Baw Tourist Road, features one of the toughest climbs accessible by road bicycles in Australia. The final climb of rises at an average grade of 11.5%, maxing out at 20.3%. The climb is not as long as, but considerably steeper than, any of the &quot;hors catégorie&quot; climbs featured in the Tour de France. The Mount Baw Baw Classic, which began in 2001, is an annual cycling race held by the Warragul Cycling Club, and ends at the Mount Baw Baw village.

===Downhill mountain biking===
There is a purpose-built downhill track located on the south western side of the mountain, facing towards the sea. The course has hosted the Victorian Downhill Championships as well as a number of state rounds. The track is around  min in duration, comprising a good mix of cambered dirt, rocks, fire road and technical sections. A shuttle service is provided from the base of the track along the Mount Baw Baw Tourist Road back to the Baw Baw Village, so that the venue is very mountain bike friendly.

<doc id="692369" wikidata="Q5477527" url="?curid=692369" title="Fractional coloring">
<text>Fractional coloring is a topic in a young branch of graph theory known as fractional graph theory. It is a generalization of ordinary graph coloring. In a traditional graph coloring, each vertex in a graph is assigned some color, and adjacent vertices — those connected by edges — must be assigned different colors. In a fractional coloring however, a &quot;set&quot; of colors is assigned to each vertex of a graph. The requirement about adjacent vertices still holds, so if two vertices are joined by an edge, they must have no colors in common.

Fractional graph coloring can be viewed as the linear programming relaxation of traditional graph coloring. Indeed, fractional coloring problems are much more amenable to a linear programming approach than traditional coloring problems.

==Definitions==
A b&quot;-fold coloring of a graph &quot;G&quot; is an assignment of sets of size &quot;b&quot; to vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices receive disjoint sets. An a&quot;:&quot;b&quot;-coloring is a &quot;b&quot;-fold coloring out of &quot;a&quot; available colors. Equivalently, it can be defined as a homomorphism to the Kneser graph . The &quot;b&quot;-fold chromatic number formula_1 is the least &quot;a&quot; such that an &quot;a&quot;:&quot;b&quot;-coloring exists.

The fractional chromatic number formula_2 is defined to be:

:formula_3

Note that the limit exists because formula_1 is &quot;subadditive&quot;, meaning:formula_5

The fractional chromatic number can equivalently be defined in probabilistic terms. formula_2 is the smallest &quot;k&quot; for which there exists a probability distribution over the independent sets of &quot;G&quot; such that for each vertex &quot;v&quot;, given an independent set &quot;S&quot; drawn from the distribution:

:formula_7

==Properties==
We have:

:formula_8

with equality for vertex-transitive graphs,
where &quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the order of &quot;G&quot;, α(&quot;G&quot;) is the independence number.

Moreover:
:formula_9

where ω(&quot;G&quot;) is the clique number, and formula_10 is the chromatic number.

Furthermore, the fractional chromatic number approximates the chromatic number within a logarithmic factor, in fact:

:formula_11

Kneser graphs give examples where: formula_12 is arbitrarily large, since: formula_13 while formula_14

==Linear programming (LP) formulation==
The fractional chromatic number formula_2 of a graph &quot;G&quot; can be obtained as a solution to a linear program. Let formula_16 be the set of all independent sets of &quot;G&quot;, and let formula_17 be the set of all those independent sets which include vertex &quot;x&quot;. For each independent set &quot;I&quot;, define a nonnegative real variable &quot;xI&quot;. Then formula_2 is the minimum value of:

: formula_19
subject to: 
:formula_20 
for each vertex formula_21.

The dual of this linear program computes the &quot;fractional clique number&quot;, a relaxation to the rationals of the integer concept of clique number. That is, a weighting of the vertices of &quot;G&quot; such that the total weight assigned to any independent set is at most &quot;1&quot;. The strong duality theorem of linear programming guarantees that the optimal solutions to both linear programs have the same value. Note however that each linear program may have size that is exponential in the number of vertices of &quot;G&quot;, and that computing the fractional chromatic number of a graph is NP-hard. This stands in contrast to the problem of fractionally coloring the edges of a graph, which can be solved in polynomial time. This is a straightforward consequence of Edmonds&#x27; matching polytope theorem.

==Applications==
Applications of fractional graph coloring include &quot;activity scheduling&quot;. In this case, the graph &quot;G&quot; is a &quot;conflict graph&quot;: an edge in &quot;G&quot; between the nodes &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; denotes that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; cannot be active simultaneously. Put otherwise, the set of nodes that are active simultaneously must be an independent set in graph &quot;G&quot;.

An optimal fractional graph coloring in &quot;G&quot; then provides a shortest possible schedule, such that each node is active for (at least) 1 time unit in total, and at any point in time the set of active nodes is an independent set. If we have a solution &quot;x&quot; to the above linear program, we simply traverse all independent sets &quot;I&quot; in an arbitrary order. For each &quot;I&quot;, we let the nodes in &quot;I&quot; be active for formula_22 time units; meanwhile, each node not in &quot;I&quot; is inactive.

In more concrete terms, each node of &quot;G&quot; might represent a &quot;radio transmission&quot; in a wireless communication network; the edges of &quot;G&quot; represent &quot;interference&quot; between radio transmissions. Each radio transmission needs to be active for 1 time unit in total; an optimal fractional graph coloring provides a minimum-length schedule (or, equivalently, a maximum-bandwidth schedule) that is conflict-free.

===Comparison with traditional graph coloring===
If one further required that each node must be active &quot;continuously&quot; for 1 time unit (without switching it off and on every now and then), then traditional graph vertex coloring would provide an optimal schedule: first the nodes of color 1 are active for 1 time unit, then the nodes of color 2 are active for 1 time unit, and so on. Again, at any point in time, the set of active nodes is an independent set.

In general, fractional graph coloring provides a shorter schedule than non-fractional graph coloring; there is an integrality gap. It may be possible to find a shorter schedule, at the cost of switching devices (such as radio transmitters) on and off more than once.

<doc id="692371" wikidata="Q531473" url="?curid=692371" title="Catherine Gore">
<text>Catherine Grace Frances Gore (&quot;née&quot; Moody; 12 February 1798 – 29 January 1861), was a prolific English novelist and dramatist. The daughter of a wine merchant from Retford, Nottinghamshire, she became among the best known of the silver fork writers, who depicted gentility and etiquette in the high society of the Regency period.

==Early life and marriage==
Gore was born in 1798 in London, the youngest child of Mary (&quot;née&quot; Brinley) and Charles Moody, a wine merchant. Her father died soon afterwards, and her mother remarried in 1801, to the London physician Charles D. Nevinson. She is therefore referred to sometimes as &quot;Miss Nevinson&quot; by contemporary reviewers and in scholarly writings. Gore herself was interested in writing from an early age, gaining the nickname &quot;the Poetess&quot;.

She married Lieutenant Charles Arthur Gore of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards on 15 February 1823 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square; Gore retired later that year. They later moved to France. They had ten children, eight of whom died young. Their one surviving son, Captain Augustus Frederick Wentworth Gore, married Hon. Emily Anne Curzon, daughter of MP Robert Curzon and granddaughter of Viscount Curzon, in 1861, and was the father of tennis champion Arthur Wentworth Gore. Their eldest child and sole surviving daughter, Cecilia Anne Mary, married Lord Edward Thynne in 1853.

==Literary career==
Gore&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Theresa Marchmont, or The Maid of Honour&quot;, was published in 1824. Her first major success was &quot;Pin Money&quot;, published in 1831, but her most popular and well-known novel was to be &quot;Cecil, or Adventures of a Coxcomb&quot;, published in 1841. Gore also met with success as a playwright, writing eleven plays that made their way onto the London stage, although her plays never quite matched the fame of her witty novels. Amongst her plays are &quot;The School for Coquettes&quot; (1831) and &quot;Quid Pro Quo&quot; (1844).

The Gores resided mainly in Continental Europe, where Catherine supported her family by her voluminous writings. Between 1824 and 1862 she produced about 70 works, the most successful of which were novels of fashionable English life, such as &quot;Manners of the Day&quot; (1830), &quot;Cecil, or the Adventures of a Coxcomb&quot; and &quot;The Banker&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1843). She wrote articles in &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Albany Poyntz&quot;. She also wrote for the stage, composed music, and published &quot;The Book of Roses, or The Rose Fancier&#x27;s Manual&quot; (1838), a guide to the cultivation of roses. 

Gore&#x27;s 1861 obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; concluded that Gore was &quot;the best novel writer of her class and the wittiest woman of her age.&quot;

<doc id="692372" wikidata="Q975953" url="?curid=692372" title="Almond milk">
<text>Almond milk is a plant-based milk substitute with a watery texture and nutty flavor manufactured from almonds, although some types or brands are flavored in imitation of cow&#x27;s milk. It does not contain cholesterol or lactose and is low in saturated fat. Almond milk is often consumed by those who are lactose-intolerant and others, such as vegans, who do not consume dairy products. Commercial almond milk comes in sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla and chocolate flavors, and is usually fortified with micronutrients. It can also be made at home using a blender, almonds and water.

Global almond milk sales in 2018 were US$5.8 billion, growing at 14% per year, and forecast to be a $13 billion global market by 2025.

==History==

Almond milk was used as a substitute for animal milk in the Middle Ages in areas that followed Catholic fasting doctrines. Historian Carolyn Walker Bynum notes that:

... Medieval cookbooks suggest that the aristocracy observed fasting strictly, if legalistically. Meat-day and fish-day recipes were not separated in medieval recipe collections, as they were in later, better-organized cookbooks. But the most basic dishes were given in fast-day as well as
ordinary-day versions. For example, a thin split-pea puree, sometimes enriched with fish stock or almond milk (produced by simmering ground almonds in water), replaced meat broth on fast days; and almond milk was a general (and expensive) substitute for cow&#x27;s milk.
Almond milk&#x27;s popularity as a dairy substitute continued throughout history, going well into modern times. It is even mentioned under the secondary definition of &quot;milk&quot; in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary in 1755, alongside pistachio milk.

==Commerce==
In the United States, almond milk remained a niche health food item until the early 2000s, when its popularity began to increase. In 2011 alone, almond milk sales increased by 79%. In 2013, it surpassed soy milk as the most popular plant-based milk in the US. As of 2014 it comprised 60 percent of plant-milk sales and 4.1 percent of total milk sales in the US.

Manufacturers and distributors of animal milk have advocated that plant-based milk not be labelled as &quot;milk&quot;. They complain that consumers may be confused between the two, and that plant-based milks are not necessarily as nutritious in terms of vitamins and minerals. In the United States, as of 2021, though the USDA is investigating and various state legislatures are considering regulation, various courts have determined that reasonable consumers are not confused, and the FDA has enacted no regulations against plant-based milk labels. European Union regulations require &quot;milk&quot; to be used for animals only, except coconut milk. (See .)

Within the Italian regions of Sicily, Apulia, Calabria, and Campania, almond milk is a protected traditional agricultural product.

Brands include Almond Breeze, Elmhurst 1925, Mooala, Silk and Kirkland Signature.

==Nutrition==
If unfortified, almond milk has less vitamin D than fortified cows&#x27; milk; in North America, cows&#x27; milk must be fortified with vitamin D, but vitamins are added to plant milks on a voluntary basis. Vitamin E is released from the almonds and absorbed. The positive effects of the vitamin E include strengthening the cells. Because of its low protein content, almond milk is not a suitable replacement for breast milk, cows&#x27; milk, or hydrolyzed formulas for children under two years of age.

==Production==
The general production method involves soaking and grinding almonds in an excess of water. A milky white liquid is obtained after filtering the almond pulp (flesh). Almond milk can also be made by adding water to almond butter. In commercial production, almond milk is homogenised with high pressure and pasteurised for greater stability and shelf life.

Almond milk can be stored in the fridge in an air-tight container (preferably a glass container) for about 4-5 days. However, certain factors, such as the temperature of the refrigerator, sterilization of the blender or storing jar, and surface cleanliness, can decide how many days you can keep it fresh. Storing homemade almond milk for more than a week may reduce its nutrition or even make it unhealthy.

In July 2015, a class action lawsuit was filed in New York City against two American manufacturers, Blue Diamond Growers and White Wave Foods, for false advertising regarding the small quantity of almonds (only 2%) contained in the final product. In October 2015, a judge denied the plaintiff&#x27;s request for an injunction.

== Sustainability ==


Almond production in California is concentrated mainly in the Central Valley, where the mild climate, rich soil, and abundant sunshine and water supply make for ideal growing conditions. Due to the persistent droughts in California in the early 21st century, it became more difficult to raise almonds in a sustainable manner.

Almond sustainability is challenged because of the high amount of water needed to grow almonds: a single glass of almond milk requires roughly of water to produce. Among plant-based milks, almond milk requires substantially more water during the growing and production stages than soy, rice or oat milk (graph). Dairy milk requires more water to produce than almond milk (graph). In 2014, California produced 42.3 billion pounds of cow&#x27;s milk and only 2.14 billion pounds of almond milk.

Sustainability strategies implemented by the Almond Board of California and almond farmers include:
* tree and soil health, and other farming practices
* minimizing dust production during the harvest
* bee health
* irrigation guidelines for farmers
* food safety
* use of waste biomass as coproducts with a goal to achieve zero waste
* use of solar energy during processing
* job development
* support of scientific research to investigate the potential health benefits of consuming almonds
* international education about sustainability practices

<text>The Vanguard Group, Inc. is an American registered investment adviser founded on May 1, 1975, and based in Malvern, Pennsylvania, with about $10.4 trillion in global assets under management as of November 2024. It is the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock&#x27;s iShares (as of January 31, 2025 Vanguard offers 428 funds globally). In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management. Along with BlackRock and State Street, Vanguard is considered to be one of the Big Three index fund managers that play a dominant role in retail investing.

Founder and former chairman John C. Bogle is credited with the creation of the first index fund available to individual investors and was a proponent and major enabler of low-cost investing by individuals, though Rex Sinquefield has also been credited with the first index fund open to the public a few years before Bogle.

Vanguard is owned by the funds managed by the company and is therefore owned by its customers. Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: &quot;investor shares&quot; and &quot;admiral shares&quot;. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment, often between $3,000 and $100,000 per fund. Vanguard&#x27;s corporate headquarters is in Malvern, a suburb of Philadelphia. It has satellite offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dallas, Texas, Washington D.C., and Scottsdale, Arizona, as well as Canada, Australia, Asia, and Europe.

== History ==

=== Formation ===

In 1951, for his undergraduate thesis at Princeton University, John C. Bogle conducted a study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn more money compared to broad stock market indexes. Even if the stocks in the funds beat the benchmark index, management fees reduced the returns to investors below the returns of the benchmark.

Immediately after graduating from Princeton University in 1951, Bogle was hired by Wellington Management Company. In 1966, he forged a merger with a fund management group based in Boston. He became president in 1967 and CEO in 1970. However, the merger ended badly and Bogle was therefore fired in 1974. Bogle has said about being fired: &quot;The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot. And if I had not been fired then, there would not have been a Vanguard.&quot;

Bogle arranged to start a new fund division at Wellington. He named it Vanguard, after Horatio Nelson&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of the Nile, . Bogle chose this name after a dealer in antique prints left him a book about Great Britain&#x27;s naval achievements that featured HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;. Wellington executives initially resisted the name, but narrowly approved it after Bogle mentioned that Vanguard funds would be listed alphabetically next to Wellington Funds.

=== Growth of company ===

The Wellington executives prohibited the fund from engaging in advisory or fund management services. Bogle saw this as an opportunity to start a passive fund tied to the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which was established in 1957. Bogle was also inspired by Paul Samuelson, an economist who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who wrote in an August 1976 column in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the S&amp;P 500.

In 1976, after getting approval from the board of directors of Wellington, Bogle established the First
Index Investment Trust (now called the Vanguard 500 Index Fund). This was one of the earliest passive investing index funds, preceded a few years earlier by a handful of others (e.g., Jeremy Grantham&#x27;s &quot;Batterymarch Financial Management&quot; in Boston, and index funds managed by Rex Sinquefield at American National Bank in Chicago, and John &quot;Mac&quot; McQuown at Wells Fargo&#x27;s San Francisco office).

Bogle&#x27;s S&amp;P 500 index raised $11 million in its initial public offering, compared to expectations of raising $150 million. The banks that managed the public offering suggested that Bogle cancel the fund due to the weak reception, but Bogle refused. At this time, Vanguard had only three employees: Bogle and two analysts. Asset growth in the first years was slow, partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it, which was unusual at the time. Within a year, the fund had only grown to $17 million in assets, but one of the Wellington Funds that Vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund, and Bogle convinced Wellington to merge it in with the Index fund. This brought assets up to almost $100 million.

Growth in assets accelerated after the beginning of a bull market in 1982, and the indexing model became more popular at other companies. These copy funds were not successful since they typically charged higher fees, which defeated the purpose of index funds. In November 1984, Vanguard launched the Vanguard Primecap fund in collaboration with Primecap. In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors. One earlier criticism of the first Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&amp;P 500. In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, an index fund of the entire stock market, excluding the S&amp;P 500. Over the next five years, other funds were launched, including a small-cap index fund, an international stock index fund, and a total stock market index fund. During the 1990s, more funds were offered, and several Vanguard funds, including the S&amp;P 500 index fund and the total stock market fund, became among the largest funds in the world, and Vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world. Noted investor John Neff retired as manager of Vanguard&#x27;s Windsor Fund in 1995, after a 30-year career in which his fund beat returns of the S&amp;P 500 index by an average of 300 basis points (3%) per year.

=== Environmental impacts ===
In March 2021, Vanguard joined over 70 asset managers, aiming to have companies within their portfolios to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060, a goal that parallels the Paris Agreement. Climate and Indigenous advocates felt optimistic about this development, but stressed the issue that Vanguard must also stop investing in companies that engage in deforestation, fossil fuel extraction, and environmental degradation. In line with their sustainability efforts, Vanguard has put out a number of statements aimed at tackling climate change within their portfolios and the world at large. Despite these statements, the company continues to have companies within their investor portfolios that contribute to fossil fuel production and the furtherance of climate change, such as ENAP Sipetrol, CPNC, and Petroamazonas. When it comes to the issue of Indigenous rights, Vanguard has released a statement titled &quot;Social Risks and Right of Indigenous Peoples&quot; which lists a series of questions for companies on the topic. However, Vanguard frames these questions with the aim of protecting Indigenous culture without any kind of concrete policy to safeguard Indigenous rights and ensure that the internationally recognized right of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent is present in discussions with Indigenous communities.

In terms of financial involvement, today, Vanguard holds at least $86 billion in coal, making them the world&#x27;s number-one investor in the industry. Additionally, according to Amazon Watch, the company holds $2.6 billion in debt and $9.6 billion in equities for oil companies currently working within the Amazon rainforest.

=== Recent ===

Bogle retired from Vanguard as chairman in 1999 when he reached the company&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 70 and he was succeeded by John J. (&quot;Jack&quot;) Brennan. In February 2008, F. William McNabb III became President and in August 2008, he became CEO. Both of Bogle&#x27;s successors expanded Vanguard&#x27;s offerings beyond the index mutual funds that Bogle preferred, in particular into exchange traded funds (ETFs) and actively managed funds. Some of Vanguard&#x27;s actively-managed funds predate Bogle&#x27;s retirement however (their healthcare stock fund began in 1984). Bogle had been skeptical of ETFs as they trade mid-day like single stocks while mutual funds trade on a single price at day&#x27;s end. He believed buy and hold investors could make good use of ETFs tracking broad indices, but thought ETFs had potentially higher fees due to the bid ask spread, could be too narrowly specialized, and worried anything that &quot;could&quot; be traded mid-day &quot;would&quot; be traded mid-day, potentially reducing investor returns.

In May 2017 Vanguard launched a fund platform in the United Kingdom.

In July 2017, it was announced that McNabb would be replaced as chief executive officer by chief investment officer Mortimer J. Buckley, effective January 1, 2018. McNabb remains at the company as chairman.

In 2020, Vanguard rolled out a digital adviser and began building up an investment team in China. In October 2020, Vanguard returned about $21 billion in managed assets to government clients in China due to concerns about legal compliance, staffing and profitability. In response to its China investments, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the nonprofit group Coalition for a Prosperous America criticized Vanguard for &quot;acting as a pipeline through which US investment dollars are being funneled into Chinese military companies and corporations sanctioned over human rights abuses.&quot;

In February 2021, Vanguard launched its fractional share program of its exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, where investors can invest for as little as $1. Fractional share ownership is a derivative of micro-investing, a type of investment strategy that is designed to make investing regular, accessible and affordable, especially for those who may not have a lot of money to invest or who are new to investing.

The Vanguard Group has been the subject of conspiracy theories, including the conspiracy theory that the Vanguard Group is part of a plot that orchestrated the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Vanguard Group conspiracy theories have also incorporated antisemitism, such as a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that Vanguard Group CEO Mortimer J. Buckley, who is of Irish Catholic heritage, is Jewish and is part of a Jewish cabal responsible for COVID and a &quot;COVID agenda&quot;.

In November 2022, Vanguard launched its superannuation fund in Australia under the name Vanguard Super.

On May 14, 2024, Vanguard announced the appointment of Salim Ramji, a veteran from BlackRock Inc., as its next CEO, succeeding Tim Buckley. Ramji, the first outsider to lead Vanguard, assumed his role on July 8, 2024.

====Ukraine====
Vanguard is one of the top five shareholders in Kernel Holding, an agribusiness that is the largest producer and exporter of grains in Ukraine. Vanguard has been donating to humanitarian aid causes in Ukraine as a response to the Russo-Ukrainian War and implementing economic sanctions against Russia.

Criticisms:

<text>Lingfield Park Racecourse (commonly referred to as Lingfield) is a horse racing course at Lingfield in Surrey, United Kingdom. It is owned by the ARC Racing and Leisure Group, formerly Arena Leisure Plc.

Lingfield is best known as a winter all-weather flat racing course; the track is Polytrack, rather than the usual turf found in the UK. There are only five other all-weather courses in the UK, the others being at Southwell, Kempton, Wolverhampton, Newcastle, and Chelmsford City (formerly Great Leighs Racecourse). Lingfield also stages National Hunt and flat races on turf.

Lingfield railway station adjoins the course, served by trains from London to East Grinstead via Oxted.

==History==
Lingfield Park racecourse is located in a estate and was opened in 1890 by the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), who gave permission for the Prince of Wales&#x27; feathers to be incorporated into the course&#x27;s official logo. The course initially held jumps racing only, but in 1894 the Jockey Club granted permission for flat racing to be held. Racing has been held continuously ever since, with the exception of the Second World War. 

The War Office requisitioned the course during the Second World War and it was used as an internment camp, to detain civilians who were citizens of one of the Axis powers.

After the war, the racecourse returned to its pre-war owners, the Beckwith-Smith family. The racecourse was put up for sale by the family in 1974 at a price of £500,000. A few weeks later, it was sold to Ladbrokes. Ladbrokes sold the course in 1982 to Ron Muddle. The new owner installed flood defences on the estate to alleviate the flooding that had become a major problem in the years immediately after the war. A golf course was developed and this opened in June 1987.

Leisure Investments purchased the Lingfield Park from Muddle in 1988 and work to install an all-weather track on the inside of the turf course was completed in October 1989. The racecourse was sold again in 1991 to Arena Leisure three years later and replacement of the Equitrack all-weather surface with Polytrack, was completed in November of the same year. Other recent developments have been the re-laying of the back straight on the turf course in 2002/2003 and the construction of a £5.5 million grandstand in 2004. In early 2009 the course had another record broken as Matsunosuke became the highest rated horse to win on the all-weather surface rated 112 or 117 by Racing Post rating.

In addition, there&#x27;s now a Marriott hotel based on the racecourse.

The racecourse is featured in the 1954 film &quot;The Rainbow Jacket&quot;.

<text>Qualifying for the UEFA Euro 2000 final tournament, took place throughout 1998 and 1999. Forty-nine teams were divided into nine groups. All teams played against each other, within their groups, on a home-and-away basis. The winner of each group and the best runner-up qualified automatically for the final tournament. The rest of the runners-up played an additional set of playoff matches amongst each other.

Both Belgium and the Netherlands qualified automatically as co-hosts of the event.

==Qualified teams==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Qualification seeding==
The draw occurred on 18 January 1998, in Ghent, Belgium. The 49 participating teams were divided into five drawing pots based on the newly introduced 1997-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which calculated an average of the team&#x27;s points per game achieved combined in the Euro 1996 and 1998 World Cup qualifiers. The seeding list was however subject to some few minor modifications:
* Germany were seeded first and not fifth as the defending champions (title holders).
* Netherlands (ranked 11th) and Belgium (ranked 18th) were not seeded, as they did not participate in the qualifying tournament due to already having qualified automatically for the final tournament as hosts. Consequently, all teams ranked below them moved up one or two seeding places higher than their rankings.

Nine groups were formed by drawing one team from each of the five pots. The remaining four teams from pot five, were subsequently drawn into four of the groups (randomly selected); meaning that the four groups with six teams featured two teams from pot five.


==Summary==


==Tiebreakers==
If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:
# Higher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference in matches played among the teams in question;
# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the matches played among the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference in all group matches;
# Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
# Higher number of away goals scored in all group matches;
# Fair play conduct in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card).

==Groups==

===Group 1===

===Group 2===

===Group 3===

===Group 4===

===Group 5===

===Group 6===

===Group 7===

===Group 8===

===Group 9===

===Ranking of second-placed teams===
The best runner-up of the entire group phase qualified automatically for the final tournament. To determine the best runner-up, a comparison was made between all of them. As some groups had five teams and others had six, matches played against fifth and sixth placed teams were discarded, despite the fact that only discarding matches against sixth-place teams would have been sufficient. After the best runner-up was found, all the others entered a random playoff to determine the last four qualifiers.

Portugal qualified automatically as best runner-up, beating Turkey on goal difference.
==Play-offs==
The remaining eight runners-up entered a random playoff, disputed in two legs, home and away.

<doc id="692401" wikidata="Q15915170" url="?curid=692401" title="Elective dictatorship">
<text>&quot;Elective dictatorship&quot;, also called &quot;executive dominance&quot; in political science, is a phrase describing the state in which a typical Westminster system state&#x27;s parliament is dominated by the government of the day. It refers to the fact that the legislative programme of Parliament is determined by the government, and government bills virtually always pass the legislature because of the nature of the majoritarian first-past-the-post electoral system, which almost always produces strong government, in combination with the imposition of party discipline on the governing party&#x27;s majority, which almost always ensures loyalty.

The phrase was popularised by the former Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom, Lord Hailsham, in a Richard Dimbleby Lecture at the BBC in 1976. The phrase is found a century earlier, in describing Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s doctrines, and was used by Hailsham (then known as Quintin Hogg) in lectures in 1968 and 1969.

==Constitutional background==
In the United Kingdom, ultimate legislative sovereignty resides in Parliament (Parliamentary sovereignty). Parliament may pass any legislation on any subject it wishes. Parliament operates without restraints such as, for instance, an obligation to legislate in accordance with fundamental constitutional rights. The apparent exceptions to this rule are situations in which Parliament has chosen to limit itself as with the case of implementation of European Union law, where British courts can &quot;disapply&quot; UK legislation that is in conflict with EU law (see &quot;Factortame&quot;), but could withdraw such authority, as it has by and large done since leaving the European Union.

Parliament consists of the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the Monarch. The customary common law rule is that in order for a bill to become an act of Parliament, it is necessary for it to be passed in both the Commons and the Lords. The bill will then go before the Monarch who has formal discretion whether to assent to the bill. On receiving Royal Assent, it will become an Act of Parliament and will be applied by the courts.

Such is the theory; in practice Royal Assent has become a formality, the monarch has not refused (or threatened to refuse) assent to a bill for some 300 years (Queen Anne in 1708). Further, since 1911, the House of Lords has lost its position of equality with the Commons. The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 reduced the power of the Lords from an absolute veto to a suspensive veto. Once the same bill has been passed by the Commons and rejected by the Lords in two different sessions of Parliament, a third introduction of the bill will require only the consent of the Commons. Such a bill will then go for Royal Assent and will become law, irrespective of the view of the Lords. The Commons have, therefore, become the dominant component of Parliament – whoever controls the Commons controls Parliament, the primary legislative body of the land.

==Operation==
The party which commands a majority in the House of Commons forms the government. The governing party should consequently be able to pass any bill they wish through the Commons, provided that voting discipline is enforced amongst their Members of Parliament (MPs). This is accomplished largely through the whip system. The dominance of Parliament&#x27;s legislative programme by the majority party is such that 95 per cent of bills are initiated by the government. Rebellions, though not unknown, are rare.

The government, so long as they can keep their MPs on-side, stand an excellent chance of getting their legislation through the Commons. The Lords may or may not also approve the legislation, however a combination of judicious compromise from the government, combined with the Salisbury Convention and the overarching threat of the Parliament Act means that most legislation also manages to get through the Lords. Royal Assent then invariably follows.

Hailsham borrowed the expression &quot;elective dictatorship&quot; to describe this situation in which control of the Commons (and thus of Parliament) by the government is actually weak. His paper was published as a criticism of the Labour government of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. He saw these governments as undemocratic, as despite their slim hold on the Commons they were able to pass a large number of their bills. He saw this as undemocratic as they did not reflect, as Hailsham saw it, wide enough support in the country. Many have interpreted Hailsham&#x27;s criticism as being one against large majorities. In fact, he actually saw these as more democratic, as they had commanded more support at elections.

==Proposals for reform==
A common proposal from reformers to reduce this executive dominance is to reduce the power of the majority party by adopting an electoral system based on proportional representation for the House of Commons. The Green Party of England and Wales, Liberal Democrats, Reform Party, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru have consistently supported proportional representation for the House of Commons, but without noticeable support from the larger parties (the Conservative Party and the Labour Party). The Electoral Reform Society is a campaigning organisation supporting the same aim.

Some groups, such as Unlock Democracy, have argued that a codified, written constitution with appropriate checks and balances is also essential to solving the problem of executive dominance, but again without popular success.

The Power Inquiry in its 2006 report &quot;Power to the People&quot; made recommendations on how to deal with the democratic deficit inherent in the British system of governance.

<text>Jack Wisdom (born 1953) is an American planetary scientist and Professor of Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his B.S. from Rice University in 1976 and his Ph.D. from California Institute of Technology in 1981. His research interests are the dynamics of the Solar System.

Wisdom pioneered the study of chaos in the solar system. His 1981 dissertation demonstrated for the first time the theoretical reason for the clearing of the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. His work has also brought to light the chaotic rotation of Hyperion, chaos in the orbital evolution of Pluto, and the chaotic obliquity of Mars which has important implications for the past Martian climate.

Work with colleague Gerald Sussman using a specially-built computer demonstrated that the solar system as a whole is chaotic on a timescale of about four million years, confirming results from Jacques Laskar. This work was responsible for &quot;shattering the long-held view of the clockwork motion of the planets.&quot;

More recently, Wisdom&#x27;s work has shed light on the complex evolution of the Moon and the tidal heating and dynamics of Enceladus.
In addition, Wisdom is credited with developing &quot;numerous analytical and numerical techniques&quot; that are fundamental to modern celestial mechanics, most notably the symplectic map for the n-body problem (developed together with Matthew J. Holman), which &quot;now forms the core of nearly every solar system dynamics integration scheme in use today.&quot;

Jack Wisdom is co-author of &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics&quot;. His 2003 paper in &quot;Science&quot; on a new geometric phase effect which Wisdom calls &quot;spacetime swimming&quot; has attracted considerable attention, although it is not yet clear whether this effect has practical utility or even can be used to devise new tests of relativistic gravitation theories.

== Awards and honors ==
* H. C. Urey Prize of the American Astronomical Society (1986)
* Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy of the AAS (1987)
* The asteroid 3402 Wisdom was named in his honor (1988)
* MacArthur Fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation (1994)
* Brouwer Award of the Division on Dynamical Astronomy of the American Astronomical Society (2001)

<doc id="692429" wikidata="Q769234" url="?curid=692429" title="Cinnabar moth">
<text>The cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) is a brightly coloured arctiid moth found as a native species in Europe and western and central Asia then east across the Palearctic to Siberia to China. It has been introduced into New Zealand, Australia and North America to control ragwort, on which its larvae feed. The moth is named after the red mineral cinnabar because of the red patches on its predominantly black wings. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Cinnabar moths are about long and have a wingspan of .

Cinnabar moths are day-flying insects with distinctive pinkish-red and black wings. There is little variation in patterning, although on rare occasions the red markings may be replaced with yellow, or the forewing is entirely red with a black border, or the wings are completely black. Like many other brightly coloured moths, it is unpalatable; the larvae use members of the genus &quot;Senecio&quot; as food plants. Many members of the genus have been recorded as food plants, but of New World Senecio and Packera species, long-term population success has only been confirmed on the North American native plant &quot;Senecio triangularis&quot;. Other plant species, such as groundsel, are sometimes used, but larval and population survival tends to be reduced. Newly hatched larvae feed from the underneath of ragwort leaves within the area of their old eggs. The larvae absorb toxic and bitter tasting alkaloid substances from the food plants, and assimilate them, becoming unpalatable themselves. The bright colours of both the larvae and the moths act as warning signs, so they are seldom eaten by predators. An exception is among different species of cuckoo which eat hairy and poisonous caterpillars including cinnabar moth larvae.

Females can lay up to 300 eggs, usually in batches of 30 to 60 on the underside of ragwort leaves. When the caterpillars (larvae) hatch they feed on and around the area of the hatched eggs but as they get bigger and moult (instars) they mainly feed on the leaves and flowers of the plant, and can be seen out in the open during the day.

Like several other Arctiinae larvae, cinnabar caterpillars can turn cannibalistic. This is mainly due to lack of food, but they can eat other cinnabar larvae. Initially, the larvae are pale yellow, but later larval stages develop a jet-black and orange/yellow striped colouring. They can grow up to , and are voracious eaters; large populations can strip entire patches of ragwort clean, a result of their low predation.

Often, very few survive to the pupal stage, mainly due to them completely consuming the food source before reaching maturity; this could be a possible explanation for their tendency to engage in seemingly random cannibalistic behaviour, as many will die from starvation. Additionally, the larvae are preyed upon by species like the ants &quot;Formica polyctena&quot;. They overwinter as cocoons on the ground.

==Relationship with humans==

The moth has proven to be particularly successful as a biocontrol agent for ragwort when used in conjunction with the Tansy ragwort flea beetle in the western United States.

<doc id="692437" wikidata="Q3595157" url="?curid=692437" title="South Central Railway zone">
<text>South Central Railway (abbreviated SCR) is one of the 19 zones of Indian Railways. The jurisdiction of the zone is spread over the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka. It has three divisions under its administration, which include Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Nanded. Secunderabad, Telangana is the Zonal headquarter

== History ==
Ex MP Bayya Suryanarayana Murthy requested in creation of a new railway zone while speaking about the size of the zones, he said the following: &quot;I am tempted to speak about the Southern zone. This zone, as I said, consists of 6,017 miles. It spreads itself like a leviathan into five States— Bombay, Mysore, Andhra Pradesh, Madras and Kerala. It is not only over-sized but it is unwieldy. The Railway Board has to consider whether it could not be bifurcated. In this connection, the creation of a new zone known as the South Central Zone may be thought of. It may consist of the following divisions: Bez-wada division, Guntakal. Hubli, Wal- tair, Secunderabad and Sholapur division. I think the creation of that new zone will relieve the General Manager of the existing zone of some of his duties and will give him breathing space to concentrate his attention upon other divisions I do not think there will be any extra expenditure if we create a new zone&quot;. Secunderabad, which will be part of the new zone, was the headquarters of the Nizam&#x27;s railways. As such, the buildings and other paraphernalia necessary for the headquarters of a zone are already there.&quot;

The zone was formed on 1 October 1966 by merging the carved-out divisions of Hubli, Vijayawada of Southern Railway zone and Solapur, Secunderabad of Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway. On 2 October 1977, Guntakal division of Southern Railway zone was merged and the already merged division of Solapur was demerged from the zone and became part of its former Central Railway zone. On 17 February 1978, Hyderabad division was formed by splitting the existing Secunderabad railway division. On 1 April 2002, two new divisions of Guntur and Nanded were created in this zone and the Hubli division was demerged and became part of South Western Railway zone.
Khandwa Akola section was merged into Bhusaval Division of Central Railways as the line was taken up for Gauge Conversion in 2017. On 27 February 2019, AP part of Waltair Division, Vijayawada, Guntur and Guntakal divisions were merged into newly formed South Coast Railway zone.

<text>Belle&#x27;s Good Cide (March 17, 1993 – March 8, 2003) was an Oklahoma-bred Thoroughbred racing mare best known as the dam of Funny Cide.

==Background==
Belle&#x27;s Good Cide was a chestnut mare bred by John Smicklas. She was sired by Slewacide out of Belle of Killarney (who also produced the stakes winning Belle of Cozzene). As a yearling she was sold for $2,800 at the 1994 Heritage Place Fall sale.

==Racing career==
Belle&#x27;s Good Cide raced for three years, starting 26 times, winning twice, and earning $26,696.

==Breeding record==

As a broodmare Belle&#x27;s Good Side&#x27;s best offspring was the gelding Funny Cide, by Distorted Humor, who won the Kentucky Derby in 2003. Her other foals included Coincide (a grey colt by Cozzene) and Rockside (a bay filly by Personal Flag

In December 2001 she was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton Midlantic mixed sale and was bought for $3,500 by the Boniface family&#x27;s Bonita Farm agentShe finished her life at McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbreds in Saratoga Springs, New York where Funny Cide was born.

Belle&#x27;s Good Cide was euthanized due to complications from colic in 2003 just after giving birth to her fourth foal, a chestnut colt by Mojave Moon and bred by Bonita Farm of Maryland. This happened shortly before Funny Cide&#x27;s Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes victories. The foal was called Homicide and began racing in the year 2006. In 2008 he proved to be a successful point to point horse in Maryland.

<doc id="692441" wikidata="Q5276893" url="?curid=692441" title="Dillie Keane">
<text>Louise Miriam &quot;Dillie&quot; Keane (born 23 May 1952) is an actress, singer and comedian. She has been a member of the comedy cabaret trio Fascinating Aïda since its 1983 inception, and has also pursued a solo career. In 1995, with Fascinating Aïda, she was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment.

==Early life==
Born in Portsmouth in 1952, Keane is the daughter of Frank Keane, a doctor from County Mayo, and Miriam Slattery, originally from Tralee, County Kerry, and was brought up in Portsmouth as a Roman Catholic. &quot;My mother was a dragon,&quot; Keane said in 2008.

Keane was educated at the strict Roman Catholic Woldingham School (or Sacred Heart), where she sang in the school choir and played the guitar on the &quot;Folk Mass&quot; album recorded by some of the girls at Abbey Road Studios in 1967. She has described the school as disorganised. At the age of eighteen, she was expelled for going to see Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot; in London with boys from Worth School.

Keane then crammed for A-levels and studied music at Trinity College, Dublin, but left the four-year course after three years and went on to study acting for three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.

==Career==

===Theatre and Fascinating Aïda===
Keane was nominated for a Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival in 1990 for her one-woman theatre show &quot;Single Again&quot; (Sean Hughes would go on to win the award), returning the following year with &quot;Citizen Keane&quot;. In 1995, with Fascinating Aïda, she was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment. Between 1999 and 2001 she toured a one-woman show, &quot;Back With You&quot;, taking in the UK and Germany, and winning the Best Comedy Award at the Moers Comedy Festival in 2001.

In 2002, Keane wrote the songs for Sandi Toksvig&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Big Night Out at the Little Palace Theatre&quot; (starring in the show itself at the Watford Palace Theatre with Toksvig and Bonnie Langford). Other works include the plays &quot;A Slice of Life&quot; (1981) and &quot;Boat People&quot; (1983). She has written songs for two pantomimes with Adèle Anderson.
Keane continued her acting career, including touring versions of &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; and &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; at the Leicester Haymarket; &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds; &quot;Accommodating Eva&quot; at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in Islington and &quot;Present Laughter&quot; at Birmingham Repertory Theatre. She was included in the premiere production of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in Dublin in 2002. She appeared with Kit and The Widow in &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; during 2005 and in the premiere one night only staging of a new musical version of &quot;Little Women&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

In 2006, Keane appeared with Jenny Eclair and Linda Robson, in &quot;Grumpy Old Women Live&quot;, and as the Duchess in &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; (2006) on a new national tour. She performed the role of Dolly in &quot;Frank and Dolly&quot; a new play by Lizzie Hopley at the Edinburgh Festival 2007, for which she was nominated for the Stage Best Actress Award, before getting back on tour with &quot;Grumpy Old Women Live&quot;. She then toured round Ireland performing the role of Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, before returning to England, and beginning to write new songs for the 25th anniversary of Fascinating Aïda, which performed for a few weeks at the Jermyn Street Theatre.

On 29 June 2008, she appeared in (and produced with Barb Jungr) &quot;The Lovely Russell Concert&quot;, which celebrated the life of her friend and colleague Russell Churney. In 2009, she toured England with Fascinating Aïda, and completed a new album.

===Television===
As well as appearing in documentaries about Fascinating Aïda, Keane has appeared with Richard Griffiths and Samantha Janus in &quot;Pie in the Sky&quot;, and with Phil Cool on a number of his series.

===Radio===
Keane has written and presented on radio for shows such as &quot;Stop the Week&quot;, &quot;4th Column&quot;, &quot;Booked!&quot; and &quot;Call Me When You&#x27;re in Something&quot; (which won the Prix Monte Carlo).

===Writing===
Keane was a columnist for the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; (1993–95), and published two books connected with Fascinating Aïda: &quot;The Joy of Sequins—The Fascinating Aïda Songbook&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fascinating Who?&quot; (1985).

==Personal life==
Keane was in a relationship with John O&#x27;Neill for over 22 years until his death from a stroke on 13 August 2022. She lives in Oxfordshire. She travels for her work, and particularly enjoys working in Ireland, the homeland of her parents.

In 2003, she was interviewed about driving a Ford Transit: &quot;I&#x27;m colossally uninterested in cars... but vans are different. They&#x27;re incredible fun to drive. You are practically always the bigger dog. People always back up in small country lanes to let you pass. And even lorry drivers are much nicer; they&#x27;ll flash you to let you in.&quot;

In the local elections of 2017, she stood as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the Ploughley division of Oxfordshire County Council. She came fourth, and was not elected.

==Honours==
In 2009, Keane was made an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Portsmouth, in recognition of her musical career and her links with the city.

<doc id="692451" wikidata="Q1537731" url="?curid=692451" title="Goose Goslin">
<text>Leon Allen &quot;Goose&quot; Goslin (October 16, 1900 – May 15, 1971) was an American professional baseball left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns, and Detroit Tigers, from until .

Goslin led the American League (AL) in triples two times and finished the season with a batting average of over .300 eleven times. He won the AL batting title in 1928 with a .379 batting average which set a Washington Senators record. He led the AL in assists five times, putouts four times and his 4,141 putouts and 181 assists as a left fielder are both 5th all time. His 173 triples are 22nd all time and his .316 batting average is 7th all time among left fielders with over 2,000 games played. A two time World Series winner, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968 via the Veterans Committee.

==Early years==
Born in Salem, New Jersey, in 1900. He grew up on his family&#x27;s 500-acre dairy farm near Fort Mott. Goslin had responsibility for milking cows in the mornings and evenings. As his baseball skills became apparent, initially as a pitcher, he took a part-time job with DuPont on the condition that he also play for the company&#x27;s baseball team.

==Professional baseball==
===Minor leagues (1920-1921)===
Goslin began his professional baseball career in 1920 at age 19 as a pitcher with the Columbia Comers of the South Atlantic League. During the 1920 season, he compiled a 6-5 record with a 2.44 Earned run average. He also played in the outfield and compiled a .317 batting average and a .461 slugging percentage. He returned to Columbia in 1921, appearing in 142 games with a .390 batting average, .594 slugging percentage, and 67 extra-base hits.

Goslin was discovered by famed scout Joe Engel. After hearing from Engel, Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith personally scouted Goslin and attended a game in Columbia, South Carolina. A fly ball hit Goslin on the head, and another barely missed him. Goslin hit three home runs in the game, and Griffith decided to take a chance on him.

===&quot;Goose&quot;===
Goslin&#x27;s difficulty in judging fly balls contributed to his nickname &quot;Goose.&quot; Opposing players said Goslin resembled a bird flapping its wings when he ran after a ball with his arms waving. While not a great fielder, Goslin did have a good throwing arm, leading the American League in assists by an outfielder in and . However, one year during spring training, Goslin wandered to an adjacent field where a track and field team was working out. Goslin tried the shot put, and his throwing arm was never the same afterward.

===Washington Senators (1921-1930)===
The 20-year-old Goslin was called up to the major leagues to play for the Washington Senators for the last two weeks of the season. He had a promising .351 on-base percentage in 14 games in 1921 and became a starter for the Senators in . Goslin played 93 games in 1922 and became a fixture for the Senators in left field until 1930. Goslin hit .324 in his first full season in 1922, followed by a .300 season in with 99 RBIs. Showing speed on the base paths, Goslin led the American League with 18 triples in 1923.

In , Goslin established himself as one of the league&#x27;s top run producers, as he led the American League with 129 RBIs and finished seventh in batting average (.344). At age 23, Goslin also hit for the cycle and was among the league leaders with 17 triples (second best), 299 total bases (fourth best) and 199 hits (fifth best). After the Senators had losing records in 1922 and 1923, Goslin helped to spark the team to a 92-win season and their first World Series championship in 1924. With a 36-year-old Walter Johnson contributing 23 wins and the young Goslin knocking in 129 runs (50 more RBI than any other player on the team), the Senators finished two games ahead of the Yankees and defeated the New York Giants in the 1924 World Series. Goslin hit .344 with three home runs, seven RBI and a .656 slugging percentage in that World Series. Goslin also set a World Series record in 1924 with six consecutive hits, spread across three games (3-5). That record was tied in 1976 by Thurman Munson and later broken in 1990 by Billy Hatcher, who had seven consecutive hits in that World Series.

Goslin contributed another strong performance to the 1925 Senators, batting .334, with 72 extra base hits and 113 RBI. His 20 triples led the American League. Once again, he batted in far more runs than any other Senators hitter – 26 more than Sam Rice. The Senators easily won their second consecutive pennant, finishing games ahead of the Philadelphia Athletics. Despite Goslin&#x27;s three home runs, six RBI and a .692 slugging percentage in the 1925 World Series, the Senators were defeated in seven games by a Pittsburgh Pirates team led by Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler and Max Carey after having taken a 3–1 lead earlier in the series.

The American League MVP award for 1924 and 1925 went to Goslin&#x27;s teammates Walter Johnson and Roger Peckinpaugh.

Goslin continued as one of the American League&#x27;s best batters with averages of .354 and .334 in 1926 and 1927, but his best season came in . That year, he won the American League batting crown with a career-high .379 batting average. He also finished among the league leaders with a .442 on-base percentage (third best in the league), a .614 slugging percentage (third best), 17 home runs (third best) and 63 extra base hits (fourth best).

The 1928 batting title was not decided until the last day of the season. Goslin and Heinie Manush of the St. Louis Browns were tied going into the final game, and the Senators and Browns played each other in the final game. Goslin was leading Manush when his turn came to bat in the ninth inning. If Goslin made an out, he would lose the batting crown. In Lawrence Ritter&#x27;s 1966 oral history, &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, Goslin described the events that followed. Manager Bucky Harris left the decision to Goslin on whether to bat or sit. Goslin decided to sit and take the batting crown, but his teammates (particularly Joe Judge) goaded him that he would appear yellow if he didn&#x27;t bat. Goslin was persuaded to bat and promptly took two strikes. At that point, Goslin recalled that he unsuccessfully tried to get ejected from the game, as the at bat would then disappear. Goslin began berating the home plate umpire about the strike calls, only to have the umpire tell him that he was not going to get ejected, and wasn&#x27;t going to get a walk, so he better step back up and swing. Goslin ended up with what he called a &quot;lucky hit&quot; to beat Manush by a fraction of a point.

===St. Louis Browns (1930-1932)===

On June 13, 1930, Washington traded Goslin to the St. Louis Browns in exchange for Alvin Crowder and Heinie Manush. Goslin batted .326 with a career-high .652 slugging percentage for the Browns in 1930. In 101 games for the Browns, Goslin had 30 home runs, 100 RBI, and 62 extra-base hits. Goslin had another solid year for the Browns in 1931, batting .328 with a career-high 42 doubles, 76 extra base hits and 105 RBI.

While Goslin&#x27;s average slipped to .299 in 1932, he still drove in 104 runs for the Browns. On Opening Day, April 12, Goslin came up to the plate against the Chicago White Sox with a bat that featured 12 longitudinal green stripes. The bat was thrown out of the game, and on the following day, American League President William Harridge declared the &quot;zebra bat&quot; illegal, as it caused a distraction to the fielding team.

===Washington Senators (1933)===
On December 14, 1932, Goslin was traded back to the Senators. Goslin led the Senators back to the 1933 World Series. The Senators played in only three World Series in their history, and Goslin played for the Senators in every game of those Series. However, Goslin did not have his usual power in 1933. His 64 RBIs and .452 slugging percentage were Goslin&#x27;s lowest numbers since his rookie season.

===Detroit Tigers (1934-1937)===
In December 1933, the Senators traded Goslin to the Detroit Tigers for John Stone. Goslin later recounted that owner Clark Griffith told him that he simply couldn&#x27;t afford to pay him. Even though the Senators had made it to the World Series, the team was not making money. In Detroit, Goslin joined Charlie Gehringer and Hank Greenberg with the trio being known as Detroit&#x27;s &quot;G-Men&quot;. Goslin appeared in 151 games for the 1934 Tigers, including 145 as the team&#x27;s starting left fielder. He ranked 14th in the American League most valuable player voting with a .305 batting average, 100 RBIs, 106 runs scored, and 38 doubles. He helped the team win the American League pennant with a 101–53 record.

Goslin had another strong season in 1935, tallying 111 RBIs, 87 runs scored, 56 bases on balls and 34 doubles. He helped the Tigers win their second consecutive American League pennant. In the 1935 World Series, he compiled a .407 on-base percentage. In the final game, Goslin came to bat with two outs with the score tied in the bottom of the ninth inning; he had a walk-off single to drive in the game-winning run.

In 1936, Goslin had his best season in Detroit, compiling a .315 batting average, 403 on-base percentage, 66 extra-base hits, 125 RBIs, and 122 runs scored. He was also selected for the first time in his career to the American League All-Star team. On July 28, 1936, Goslin hit one of the most unusual home runs in baseball history. Goslin drove the ball into the gap between right and center field. Joe DiMaggio and Myril Hoag collided in the outfield and were both knocked unconscious for several minutes. Goslin rounded the bases with an inside-the-park home run.

In 1937, Goslin&#x27;s batting average plummeted by 77 points to .238—the lowest average of his career to date. He also lost his spot as the Tigers&#x27; regular left fielder, starting only 39 games at the position. On October 3, 1937, five days after Goslin&#x27;s father died, he was unconditionally released by the Tigers.

===Washington Senators (1938)===
After his release by the Tigers, Goslin later recounted (in &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;) that he received a call from his old boss, Clark Griffith, asking him if he would be interested in ending his career back where it began in Washington. Goslin accepted the offer but batted only .158 in 38 games for the Senators during the 1938 season.

===Career statistics===
Goslin finished his career after 18 major league seasons with a .316 batting average, a .500 slugging percentage, 2,735 hits, 1,612 RBIs, 500 doubles and 173 triples. He had 11 seasons with at least 100 RBI, and his league leadership in RBIs in 1924 deprived Babe Ruth of the triple crown. He hit .300 or better in 11 seasons. He also hit three home runs in a game three times and had five hits in a game five times, along with 41 four-hit games.

Goslin holds the record for career home runs at Yankee Stadium (1923–2008) by a visiting player, with 32.

==Later years==

In April 1939, Goslin became a player-manager for the Trenton Senators of the Interstate League. He remained manager at Trenton until August 1941.

Goslin married Marion Wallace in Philadelphia in 1940. They lived in Glassboro, New Jersey. They had no children. His wife died in January 1959 after a long illness.

Goslin was a lifelong resident of South Jersey. He owned a big house in Glassboro, New Jersey, for many years, but he sold it after his wife died. In the early 1940s, he also purchased over 60 acres of meadowland in Bayside, Greenwich Township, along Stow Creek. The property included a dozen buildings, over 40 boats, a restaurant, and a sundeck with tables and chairs. Goslin spent his summers on the property during his marriage and later lived on the property, renting boats, fishing tackle, and cabins and selling fish, crabs, and lunches. At one point, he shipped 100 bushels or more each day from the property.
Goslin was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968 by the Veterans Committee. At the induction ceremony in July 1968, Goslin became overwhelmed by emotion and said: &quot;I have been lucky. I want to thank God, who gave me the health and strength to compete with these great players. I will never forget this. I will take this to my grave.&quot;

Goslin retired from his boat rental business in 1969 after his health declined. He was hospitalized in January 1969 for treatment of burns to his abdomen, after his couch caught fire when he fell asleep while smoking. He also had his larynx removed in July 1970. In May 1971, Goslin died at Bridgetown Hospital in Bridgeton, New Jersey, at age 70 and was buried in the Salem Baptist Cemetery in Salem, New Jersey.

==Honors and legacy==
In 1999, Goslin ranked number 89 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Goslin ranked #6 on the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; list of &quot;The 50 Greatest New Jersey Sports Figures&quot;.

The South Jersey chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research, located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is named after Goslin.

<doc id="692456" wikidata="Q2537655" url="?curid=692456" title="W12 engine">
<text>A W12 engine is a twelve-cylinder piston engine where either three banks of four cylinders, or four banks of three cylinders are arranged in a W configuration around a common crankshaft. 

W12 engines with three banks of four cylinders were used by several aircraft engines from 1917 until the 1930s. A three-bank design was also used for an unsuccessful W12 engine which was intended to compete in Formula One in 1990.

W12 engines are less common than V12 engines as only a handful of automobile manufacturers use them.
The WR12 engine was produced by the Volkswagen Group between 2001 and 2024. This four-bank engine – based on two VR6 engines with a common crankshaft – has only been used in flagship high performance car models produced by the Volkswagen Group and by Spyker.

== Aircraft engines ==
The Napier Lion was a three-bank design (also called &quot;broad arrow&quot; design) W12 engine produced in the United Kingdom from 1917 to the late 1930s. It had a capacity of and produced . As well as use in various military and racing airplanes, the Lion was also used in land speed record cars (such as the Napier-Railton and the Napier-Campbell Blue Bird) and racing boats (such as the Miss Britain III).

During the 1920s, the Farman 12We aircraft engine was produced in France. The 12We produced and was one of the company&#x27;s best-selling engines in the 1920s.

The Lorraine 12E Courlis is another W12 aircraft engine that was produced in France during the 1920s and 1930s.

== Motor racing engines ==
For the 1990 Formula One season, the Italian team Life Racing Engines built a three-bank W12 engine with a displacement of . The Life Racing Engine F35 used a central master connecting rod, with a slave rod locating onto each side of the master rod, rather than directly onto the crank pin. This meant that there was no offset between the cylinders, reducing the length of the crankpins. The engine was used in rounds 1 to 12 of the 1990 season, however it was unreliable and lacking in power, and the car failed to pre-qualify for any races. The W12 engine was replaced by a third-party V8 engine after round 12.
== Road car engines ==


The only mass-production W12 engine is the Volkswagen 6.0 WR12 48v, a four-bank design that was first released in 2001. The engine is constructed by mating two narrow-angle 15° VR6 engines at an inclined angle of 72°. The narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two overhead camshafts to drive each pair of banks, so the WR12 engine has both a crankshaft design, and the same number of camshafts as the V-12 engine. Where the VR6 is a staggered-bank straight 6, the WR12 in turn is a staggered-bank V-12 in terms of engineering design. As a consequence, it cannot be considered a true three-block W-engine, in the manner of the Life F-1 engine, or the Napier-Railton.

Within Volkswagen, the engine is designated a WR engine, terminology in derivation of its use of the VR6 geometry for each bank. Early Volkswagen and Audi cars using this engine were badged with a W with inset V, to emphasise the engine design. Later badging (after 2001 approximately) of cars with this engine did not make use of that particular badging, leading to confusion of the staggered-bank V-12 with a true W engine in the public mind.

The naturally aspirated variant of the WR12 engine has been used in the brands of Audi and Volkswagen. In 2003, a twin-turbocharged version of the WR12 engine was produced to be used exclusively in the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Flying Spur.

The WR12 engine has a very compact design for a 12-cylinder engine, with the overall size of the engine being smaller than Volkswagen&#x27;s contemporary V8 engine.

The first application of the Volkswagen WR12 was the 2001 Volkswagen W12 Nardò, a mid-engined concept car which set the 24‑hour world endurance record in 2001 with a distance of and an average speed of . 

The first production car to use the WR12 engine was the 2001 Audi A8 (D2). The succeeding Audi A8 (D3) and Audi A8 (D4) also had the WR12 as an upgrade engine only for the long-wheelbase variant, the Audi A8L W12, which was last available in the 2018 model year. The Audi A8L W12 with its all-wheel drive was unique among its German contemporaries, as 12-cylinder rivals from BMW and Mercedes-Benz used V12 engines with rear-wheel drive.

Other cars to use the WR12 engine are the Bentley Continental GT (2003–2024), Bentley Flying Spur (2005–2024), Bentley Bentayga (2015–2024), Volkswagen Phaeton W12 (2004–2011) and the Volkswagen Touareg W12 (2005–2010). The engine was also used in the 2006 Spyker C12 La Turbie and 2008 Spyker C12 Zagato low-volume sports cars.

In 2023, Bentley Motors announced that it will retire the W12 engine in April 2024, citing emissions targets and the brand&#x27;s impending electrification. The last Volkswagen Group W12 engine was completed by Bentley Crewe in July 2024, marking the end of the engine&#x27;s production.

<text>In linear algebra, linear transformations can be represented by matrices. If formula_1 is a linear transformation mapping formula_2 to formula_3 and formula_4 is a column vector with formula_5 entries, then there exists an formula_6 matrix formula_7, called the transformation matrix of formula_1, such that:
formula_9
Note that formula_7 has formula_11 rows and formula_5 columns, whereas the transformation formula_1 is from formula_2 to formula_3. There are alternative expressions of transformation matrices involving row vectors that are preferred by some authors.

==Uses==

Matrices allow arbitrary linear transformations to be displayed in a consistent format, suitable for computation. This also allows transformations to be composed easily (by multiplying their matrices).

Linear transformations are not the only ones that can be represented by matrices. Some transformations that are non-linear on an n-dimensional Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; can be represented as linear transformations on the &quot;n&quot;+1-dimensional space R&quot;n&quot;+1. These include both affine transformations (such as translation) and projective transformations. For this reason, 4×4 transformation matrices are widely used in 3D computer graphics. These &quot;n&quot;+1-dimensional transformation matrices are called, depending on their application, &quot;affine transformation matrices&quot;, &quot;projective transformation matrices&quot;, or more generally &quot;non-linear transformation matrices&quot;. With respect to an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional matrix, an &quot;n&quot;+1-dimensional matrix can be described as an augmented matrix.

In the physical sciences, an active transformation is one which actually changes the physical position of a system, and makes sense even in the absence of a coordinate system whereas a passive transformation is a change in the coordinate description of the physical system (change of basis). The distinction between active and passive transformations is important. By default, by &quot;transformation&quot;, mathematicians usually mean active transformations, while physicists could mean either.

Put differently, a &quot;passive&quot; transformation refers to description of the &quot;same&quot; object as viewed from two different coordinate frames.

==Finding the matrix of a transformation==

If one has a linear transformation formula_16 in functional form, it is easy to determine the transformation matrix &quot;A&quot; by transforming each of the vectors of the standard basis by &quot;T&quot;, then inserting the result into the columns of a matrix. In other words,
formula_17

For example, the function formula_18 is a linear transformation. Applying the above process (suppose that &quot;n&quot; = 2 in this case) reveals that:
formula_19

The matrix representation of vectors and operators depends on the chosen basis; a similar matrix will result from an alternate basis. Nevertheless, the method to find the components remains the same.

To elaborate, vector formula_20 can be represented in basis vectors, formula_21 with coordinates formula_22:
formula_23

Now, express the result of the transformation matrix &quot;A&quot; upon formula_20, in the given basis:
formula_25

The formula_26 elements of matrix &quot;A&quot; are determined for a given basis &quot;E&quot; by applying &quot;A&quot; to every formula_27, and observing the response vector
formula_28

This equation defines the wanted elements, formula_26, of &quot;j&quot;-th column of the matrix &quot;A&quot;.

===Eigenbasis and diagonal matrix===
Yet, there is a special basis for an operator in which the components form a diagonal matrix and, thus, multiplication complexity reduces to . Being diagonal means that all coefficients formula_30 except formula_31 are zeros leaving only one term in the sum formula_32 above. The surviving diagonal elements, formula_31, are known as eigenvalues and designated with formula_34 in the defining equation, which reduces to formula_35. The resulting equation is known as eigenvalue equation. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues are derived from it via the characteristic polynomial.

With diagonalization, it is often possible to translate to and from eigenbases.

==Examples in 2 dimensions==

Most common geometric transformations that keep the origin fixed are linear, including rotation, scaling, shearing, reflection, and orthogonal projection; if an affine transformation is not a pure translation it keeps some point fixed, and that point can be chosen as origin to make the transformation linear. In two dimensions, linear transformations can be represented using a 2×2 transformation matrix.

===Stretching===

A stretch in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane is a linear transformation which enlarges all distances in a particular direction by a constant factor but does not affect distances in the perpendicular direction. We only consider stretches along the x-axis and y-axis. A stretch along the x-axis has the form ; for some positive constant . (Note that if , then this really is a &quot;stretch&quot;; if , it is technically a &quot;compression&quot;, but we still call it a stretch. Also, if , then the transformation is an identity, i.e. it has no effect.)

The matrix associated with a stretch by a factor along the x-axis is given by:
formula_36

Similarly, a stretch by a factor k along the y-axis has the form ; , so the matrix associated with this transformation is
formula_37

===Squeezing===

If the two stretches above are combined with reciprocal values, then the transformation matrix represents a squeeze mapping:
formula_38
A square with sides parallel to the axes is transformed to a rectangle that has the same area as the square. The reciprocal stretch and compression leave the area invariant.

===Rotation===

For rotation by an angle θ counterclockwise (positive direction) about the origin the functional form is formula_39 and formula_40. Written in matrix form, this becomes:
formula_41

Similarly, for a rotation clockwise (negative direction) about the origin, the functional form is formula_42 and formula_43 the matrix form is:
formula_44

These formulae assume that the &quot;x&quot; axis points right and the &quot;y&quot; axis points up.

===Shearing===

For shear mapping (visually similar to slanting), there are two possibilities.

A shear parallel to the &quot;x&quot; axis has formula_45 and formula_46. Written in matrix form, this becomes:
formula_47

A shear parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis has formula_48 and formula_49, which has matrix form:
formula_50

===Reflection===
For reflection about a line that goes through the origin, let formula_51 be a vector in the direction of the line. Then the transformation matrix is:
formula_52

===Orthogonal projection===
To project a vector orthogonally onto a line that goes through the origin, let formula_53 be a vector in the direction of the line. Then the transformation matrix is:
formula_54

As with reflections, the orthogonal projection onto a line that does not pass through the origin is an affine, not linear, transformation.

Parallel projections are also linear transformations and can be represented simply by a matrix. However, perspective projections are not, and to represent these with a matrix, homogeneous coordinates can be used.

==Examples in 3D computer graphics==

===Rotation===

The matrix to rotate an angle &quot;θ&quot; about any axis defined by unit vector (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) is
formula_55

===Reflection===
To reflect a point through a plane formula_56 (which goes through the origin), one can use formula_57, where formula_58 is the 3×3 identity matrix and formula_59 is the three-dimensional unit vector for the vector normal of the plane. If the &quot;L&quot;2 norm of formula_60, formula_61, and formula_62 is unity, the transformation matrix can be expressed as:
formula_63

Note that these are particular cases of a Householder reflection in two and three dimensions. A reflection about a line or plane that does not go through the origin is not a linear transformation — it is an affine transformation — as a 4×4 affine transformation matrix, it can be expressed as follows (assuming the normal is a unit vector):
formula_64
where formula_65 for some point formula_66 on the plane, or equivalently, formula_67.

If the 4th component of the vector is 0 instead of 1, then only the vector&#x27;s direction is reflected and its magnitude remains unchanged, as if it were mirrored through a parallel plane that passes through the origin. This is a useful property as it allows the transformation of both positional vectors and normal vectors with the same matrix. See homogeneous coordinates and affine transformations below for further explanation.

==Composing and inverting transformations==

One of the main motivations for using matrices to represent linear transformations is that transformations can then be easily composed and inverted.

Composition is accomplished by matrix multiplication. Row and column vectors are operated upon by matrices, rows on the left and columns on the right. Since text reads from left to right, column vectors are preferred when transformation matrices are composed:

If A and B are the matrices of two linear transformations, then the effect of first applying A and then B to a column vector formula_68 is given by:
formula_69

In other words, the matrix of the combined transformation A followed by B is simply the product of the individual matrices.

When A is an invertible matrix there is a matrix A−1 that represents a transformation that &quot;undoes&quot; A since its composition with A is the identity matrix. In some practical applications, inversion can be computed using general inversion algorithms or by performing inverse operations (that have obvious geometric interpretation, like rotating in opposite direction) and then composing them in reverse order. Reflection matrices are a special case because they are their own inverses and don&#x27;t need to be separately calculated.

==Other kinds of transformations==

===Affine transformations===


To represent affine transformations with matrices, we can use homogeneous coordinates. This means representing a 2-vector (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) as a 3-vector (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, 1), and similarly for higher dimensions. Using this system, translation can be expressed with matrix multiplication. The functional form formula_70 becomes:
formula_71

All ordinary linear transformations are included in the set of affine transformations, and can be described as a simplified form of affine transformations. Therefore, any linear transformation can also be represented by a general transformation matrix. The latter is obtained by expanding the corresponding linear transformation matrix by one row and column, filling the extra space with zeros except for the lower-right corner, which must be set to 1. For example, &quot;the counter-clockwise rotation matrix from above&quot; becomes:
formula_72

Using transformation matrices containing homogeneous coordinates, translations become linear, and thus can be seamlessly intermixed with all other types of transformations. The reason is that the real plane is mapped to the plane in real projective space, and so translation in real Euclidean space can be represented as a shear in real projective space. Although a translation is a non-linear transformation in a 2-D or 3-D Euclidean space described by Cartesian coordinates (i.e. it can&#x27;t be combined with other transformations while preserving commutativity and other properties), it becomes, in a 3-D or 4-D projective space described by homogeneous coordinates, a simple linear transformation (a shear).

More affine transformations can be obtained by composition of two or more affine transformations. For example, given a translation T&#x27; with vector formula_73 a rotation R by an angle θ counter-clockwise, a scaling S with factors formula_74 and a translation T of vector formula_75 the result M of T&#x27;RST is:
formula_76

When using affine transformations, the homogeneous component of a coordinate vector (normally called &quot;w&quot;) will never be altered. One can therefore safely assume that it is always 1 and ignore it. However, this is not true when using perspective projections.

===Perspective projection===


Another type of transformation, of importance in 3D computer graphics, is the perspective projection. Whereas parallel projections are used to project points onto the image plane along parallel lines, the perspective projection projects points onto the image plane along lines that emanate from a single point, called the center of projection. This means that an object has a smaller projection when it is far away from the center of projection and a larger projection when it is closer (see also reciprocal function).

The simplest perspective projection uses the origin as the center of projection, and the plane at formula_77 as the image plane. The functional form of this transformation is then formula_78; formula_79. We can express this in homogeneous coordinates as:
formula_80

After carrying out the matrix multiplication, the homogeneous component formula_81 will be equal to the value of formula_82 and the other three will not change. Therefore, to map back into the real plane we must perform the homogeneous divide or perspective divide by dividing each component by formula_81:
formula_84

More complicated perspective projections can be composed by combining this one with rotations, scales, translations, and shears to move the image plane and center of projection wherever they are desired.

<text>Charles Sherman Ruggles (February 8, 1886 – December 23, 1970) was an American comic character actor. In a career spanning six decades, Ruggles appeared in close to 100 feature films, often in mild-mannered and comic roles. He was also the elder brother of director, producer, and silent film actor Wesley Ruggles (1889–1972).

==Career==
Ruggles was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1886. Despite training to be a doctor, Ruggles soon found himself on the stage, appearing in a stock production of &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; in 1905. In 1912, he worked in the stock company at Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco in a stage production of &quot;The Dawn of a Tomorrow&quot;. At Los Angeles&#x27;s Majestic Theatre, he played Private Jo Files in L. Frank Baum and Louis F. Gottschalk&#x27;s musical &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; in 1913.

He moved to Broadway to appear in &quot;Help Wanted&quot; in 1914. His first screen role came in the silent &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; the following year. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Ruggles continued to appear in silent movies, though his passion remained the stage, appearing in long-running productions such as &quot;The Passing Show of 1918&quot;, &quot;The Demi-Virgin&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night in a Turkish Bath&quot;, and &quot;Battling Buttler&quot;. One of his most famous stage hits was &quot;Queen High&quot;, one of his last before a nearly 30-year hiatus, produced in 1926. He also played Peter Braley in &quot;Spring Is Here&quot;, which ran for 104 performances in 1929.

From 1929, Ruggles appeared in talking pictures. His first was &quot;Gentleman of the Press&quot; in which he played a comic, alcoholic newspaper reporter. Throughout the 1930s, he was teamed with comic actress Mary Boland in a string of domestic farces, notably &quot;If I Had a Million&quot;, &quot;Six of a Kind&quot;, &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;, and &quot;People Will Talk&quot;. Ruggles is best remembered today as the big-game hunter in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and billionaire Michael J. &quot;Mike&quot; O&#x27;Connor in &quot;It Happened on Fifth Avenue&quot;.

In 1944, he had a summer radio series, &quot;The Charlie Ruggles Show&quot; on CBS.

In 1949, Ruggles halted his film career to return to the stage and to move into television. He was the headline character in the TV series &quot;The Ruggles&quot; (1949–52), a family comedy in which he played a character also called Charlie Ruggles and was again the headline character in the daily sitcom &quot;The World of Mr. Sweeney&quot;, which ran for 345 episodes in 1954–55.

Ruggles returned to the big screen in 1961, playing Charles McKendrick in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; and Mackenzie Savage in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot;. In the latter film, he reprised the role for which he had won a Tony Award in 1959. In 1963 he memorably played the grandfather of the silent film star Corinne Griffith in &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot;. Griffith had written the book of her early life on which the film is based.

Ruggles made guest appearances in episodes of various television series through the 1950s and 1960s, such as a time-traveling librarian in &quot;Man from 1997,&quot; a 1956 science fiction episode of the television series &quot;Conflict&quot;, and a 1961 appearance as a wealthy neighbor who offers to finance a European trip for Hassie McCoy on &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, in the season 5 episode &quot;Hassie&#x27;s European Tour&quot;. Ruggles had a recurring guest role on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in the mid-1960s as Lowell Redlings Farquhar, father-in-law of Milburn Drysdale (Raymond Bailey). Ruggles also played Aunt Clara&#x27;s (Marion Lorne) old flame, the warlock Hedley Partridge, as well as a Mr. Caldwell, whose company marketed soup, in the television series &quot;Bewitched&quot;. In &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, he played Jameson Hershey, the owner of an elderly horse, Herman, that joins up with the wagon train. He played Congressman John Canfield on an episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; called &quot;Aunt Bee, The Swinger&quot; and appeared as a driving instructor on &quot;The Munsters&quot;. Ruggles also lent his voice to the &quot;Aesop and Son&quot; features in Jay Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

One of Ruggles&#x27; last television appearances before his death was a starring role in the syndicated television special &quot;The Wonder Circus&quot;, where he played Charlie Wonder, a retired ringmaster who talked about his life leading a circus.

==Personal life==
His marriage to Adele Rowland (1914–1916) ended in divorce after two years. He then married Barbara Guillan and they remained married until her death in 1941. He married Marion LaBarba in 1942; the couple remained wed until his death in 1970.

==Death==
Ruggles died of cancer at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on December 23, 1970, at the age of 84.

He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California in the Garden of Memory near his brother Wesley Ruggles.

==Legacy==
Charlie Ruggles has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his contributions to motion pictures on 6200 Hollywood Boulevard, one for his radio work on 6300 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for television on 1600 Vine Street.

<doc id="692463" wikidata="Q7370313" url="?curid=692463" title="Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)">
<text>This article concerns the [[rotation]] [[Operator (physics)|operator]], as it appears in quantum mechanics.

==Quantum mechanical rotations==
With every physical rotation formula_1, we postulate a quantum mechanical rotation operator formula_2 that is the rule that assigns to each vector in the space formula_3 the vector 
formula_4
that is also in formula_5. We will show that, in terms of the generators of rotation,
formula_6
where formula_7 is the rotation axis, formula_8 is angular momentum operator, and formula_9 is the reduced Planck constant.

==The translation operator==

The rotation operator formula_10, with the first argument formula_11 indicating the rotation axis and the second formula_12 the rotation angle, can operate through the translation operator formula_13 for infinitesimal rotations as explained below. This is why, it is first shown how the translation operator is acting on a particle at position x (the particle is then in the state formula_14 according to Quantum Mechanics).

Translation of the particle at position formula_15 to position formula_16: formula_17

Because a translation of 0 does not change the position of the particle, we have (with 1 meaning the identity operator, which does nothing):
formula_18
formula_19

Taylor development gives:
formula_20
with formula_21

From that follows:
formula_22

This is a differential equation with the solution

formula_23

Additionally, suppose a Hamiltonian formula_5 is independent of the formula_15 position. Because the translation operator can be written in terms of formula_26, and formula_27, we know that formula_28 This result means that linear momentum for the system is conserved.

==In relation to the orbital angular momentum==
 Classically we have for the angular momentum formula_29 This is the same in quantum mechanics considering formula_30 and formula_31 as operators. Classically, an infinitesimal rotation formula_32 of the vector formula_33 about the formula_11-axis to formula_35 leaving formula_11 unchanged can be expressed by the following infinitesimal translations (using Taylor approximation):
formula_37

From that follows for states:
formula_38

And consequently:
formula_39

Using 
formula_40
from above with formula_41 and Taylor expansion we get:
formula_42
with formula_43 the formula_11-component of the angular momentum according to the classical cross product.

To get a rotation for the angle formula_45, we construct the following differential equation using the condition formula_46:

formula_47

Similar to the translation operator, if we are given a Hamiltonian formula_5 which rotationally symmetric about the formula_11-axis, formula_50 implies formula_51. This result means that angular momentum is conserved.

For the spin angular momentum about for example the formula_52-axis we just replace formula_53 with formula_54 (where formula_55 is the Pauli Y matrix) and we get the spin rotation operator 
formula_56

==Effect on the spin operator and quantum states==
Operators can be represented by matrices. From linear algebra one knows that a certain matrix formula_57 can be represented in another basis through the transformation
formula_58
where formula_59 is the basis transformation matrix. If the vectors formula_60 respectively formula_61 are the z-axis in one basis respectively another, they are perpendicular to the y-axis with a certain angle formula_45 between them. The spin operator formula_63 in the first basis can then be transformed into the spin operator formula_64 of the other basis through the following transformation:
formula_65

From standard quantum mechanics we have the known results formula_66 and formula_67 where formula_68 and formula_69 are the top spins in their corresponding bases. So we have:
formula_70
formula_71

Comparison with formula_66 yields formula_73.

This means that if the state formula_69 is rotated about the formula_52-axis by an angle formula_45, it becomes the state formula_68, a result that can be generalized to arbitrary axes.

<doc id="692464" wikidata="Q7381456" url="?curid=692464" title="Russell Davies">
<text>Robert Russell Davies (born 5 April 1946) is a British journalist and broadcaster.

Davies was born in Barmouth, North Wales. He attended Manchester Grammar School, according to his own statement on a November 2010 &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; programme. Also according to the programme, his grandfather was a mole-catcher. During his time at MGS (1957–64) he acted in dramatic society productions and was appointed school vice-captain.

He gained a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and was awarded a first class degree in Modern and Mediaeval Languages in 1967, but soon abandoned his post-graduate studies in German literature when the opportunity arose to tour with the Cambridge Footlights revue. During his time in Cambridge, he contributed topical cartoons to the news pages of &quot;Varsity&quot;, the undergraduate newspaper, under the pseudonym Dai.

In 1970, Davies co-starred with fellow Footlights alumni Pete Atkin, Clive James and Julie Covington across three London Weekend Television series. &quot;The Party&#x27;s Moving On&quot; and &quot;What Are You Doing After the Show?&quot; were revue-style shows, featuring original music written by Atkin and James along with sketches and commentary. &quot;Think Twice&quot; focused on discussion of the arts between Davies and co-host Clive James. He appeared on Atkin&#x27;s first album &quot;Beware of the Beautiful Stranger&quot; playing tuba, and also on Covington&#x27;s first album &quot;The Beautiful Changes&quot; playing tuba and trumpet.

In 1970, Davies co-starred in the BBC comedy series &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Us&quot;, alongside Richard Stilgoe and Maureen Lipman.

His felt limited by his early acting credits, a string of comedy roles offered by his agent. To diversify his career, he found fulfilling work as a writer and presenter. Davies became a film and television critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and contributed features and sports columns for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, caricatures for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and was a deputy editor of &quot;Punch&quot;. He edited Kenneth Williams&#x27;s diaries and letters for publication, despite being the target of Williams&#x27;s acid pen in those same diaries. He regularly appeared on television in the 1980s, presenting &quot;Saturday Review&quot; for BBC2.

In 1988, Davies was the presenter of a 12-part BBC radio series &quot;Radio Fun&quot; chronicling the history of comedy on the radio from the thirties to the present day. The series was repeated from 2007 to 2010 on BBC Radio 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra).

Davies is a jazz trombonist and has presented television and radio documentaries on jazz, including in 1999 a year-long history for BBC Radio 3, &quot;Jazz Century&quot;. He has written and presented other radio programmes including BBC Radio 4&#x27;s series &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; (winner of the 1996 European Radio, ONDAS prize), and a series on Radio 2 about songwriters Rodgers and Hart, &quot;Legends of Light Music&quot;. In 2003, Russell Davies wrote and presented &quot;Quest for Perfection&quot;, a film about jazz clarinetist and bandleader Artie Shaw, for BBC Four and produced by John Warburton (shortlisted for the 2004 Grierson Award). His documentary on the life of the cartoonist Ronald Searle was shown on the BBC in 2006.

He presents &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; on Radio 4, first temporarily to cover the illness of presenter Robert Robinson, then permanently from 2010 when Robinson retired. From 1998 (when he took over from Benny Green) until 29 September 2013, he presented a Sunday radio programme on BBC Radio 2 called &#x27;The Russell Davies Song Show&#x27; which showcased &#x27;The Art, Craft &amp; Inspiration of the Popular Song&#x27;. The show was produced by Roy Oakshott and predominantly featured music from &#x27;The Great American Songbook&#x27; and the pre-rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll jazz era. He has also presented the BBC Radio 4 music quiz &quot;Counterpoint&quot;.

<text>Powers is a creator-owned comic book series written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by Michael Avon Oeming. The series&#x27; first volume was published by Image Comics from 2000 to 2004, the latter moving to Marvel Comics as a part of its Icon imprint. In 2018 it moved to DC Comics as part of its Jinxworld imprint. The Jinxworld imprint moved in 2021 to Dark Horse Comics. The characters and its creators appear in Crossover (Image Comics).

Combining the genres of superhero fiction, crime noir and the police procedural, the series follows the lives of two homicide detectives, Christian Walker and Deena Pilgrim, assigned to investigate cases involving people with superhuman abilities, who are referred to colloquially as &quot;powers&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Conception===
Brian Michael Bendis, Michael Avon Oeming and David W. Mack became friends while all three were working on individual small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to &quot;analyz[e] why it was that I [had] never attempted to write a superhero comic&quot; at the time, while he was writing crime books such as &quot;Jinx&quot; and &quot;Goldfish&quot;, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot; had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres. The series&#x27; concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as &quot;&quot;, Janis Joplin&#x27;s biography, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;T-Men&quot;, &quot;Traffic&quot; and &quot;Visions Of Light: The Art of Cinematography&quot;, and would take the form of a &quot;Behind the Music&quot;-type look at superheroes. &quot;Powers&quot;, Oeming says, is &quot;a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... [as] observed by the media&quot; and everyday individuals. Bendis&#x27; intention was to view the &quot;cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops&quot;, but with the added layer that (echoing &quot;Behind the Music&quot;) &quot;every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story&quot;. Bendis&#x27; scripts are often compiled from &quot;a list of scenes&quot;, eschewing &quot;the big exploding ending&quot; in favor of a &quot;character-driven or psychological ending&quot;. Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond &#x27;mere&#x27; police procedurals (despite those being both creators&#x27; &quot;favorite stories&quot;), constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over &quot;just being cool&quot;, and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story.

Bendis would collaborate with Oeming, who had already expressed interest in producing a crime/noir comic with Bendis, inspired by his attempts to get work on &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; to do a book in a style reminiscent of Bruce Timm and Alex Toth. Bendis cites two images produced by Oeming (one for Bendis&#x27; &quot;Jinx&quot;, and one for David Mack&#x27;s series &quot;Kabuki&quot;) as originating the then-experimental &quot;Powers&#x27; style&quot; and &quot;inspir[ing] everything in [&quot;Powers&quot;]&quot;. Indeed, Bendis and Oeming&#x27;s first collaboration was &quot;Mall Outing&quot; in &quot;Jinx: True Crime Confessions&quot;. It is included in &quot;Little Deaths&quot; &quot;for Powers completists and curiosity&#x27;s sake&quot;. Oeming has noted that, although seen as an overtly &quot;cartoony&quot; style, the artwork does not appeal to children, which helps sidestep the potential problem of the book, which contains mature content, being purchased by customers younger than its intended audience.

Despite both creators only having produced work in black and white before &quot;Powers&quot;, Bendis envisioned &quot;Powers&quot; in color, and convinced Oeming that it could work, despite the dramatically higher number of sales required to sustain a color comic. Bendis also convinced Oeming that the book should juxtapose both the superhero and crime noir genres, as Oeming initially shied away from the former. Bendis writes in the &#x27;Sketchbook&#x27; section of the &quot;Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl?&quot; TPB that &quot;one of the rules of film noir is that the city itself should be considered a lead character&quot;. To this end, he made Oeming watch &quot;Visions of Light&quot;, a documentary by the American Cinematographers Institute about the art of lighting in film, which he saw as important to the feel of comics also. According to Oeming, both he and Bendis do copious research for their projects, and that before he began the series, he would do ride-alongs with police, meet police officials, and take extensive photo reference of their equipment. 

===Launch===
&quot;Powers&quot; was initially pitched to DC Comics, after DC inquired of Bendis and Oeming what they were hoping to create. Bendis ultimately retained ownership of his creation, which allows him complete freedom as the writer.

Bendis and Oeming were initially worried, after having produced but not solicited two issues of the series, to learn that writer Alan Moore was preparing what was to become &quot;Top 10&quot; for America&#x27;s Best Comics. Although the creators had been confident that the idea of a book juxtaposing superheroes and the police procedural had not been done previously, the knowledge that Moore was doing something similar nearly led them to abandon the series, before discovering that &quot;Top Ten&quot; featured superhero police officers and a different enough approach that led them to feel safe in continuing.

&quot;Powers&quot; was initially previewed in a series of original strips which ran in Cliff Biggers and Ward Batty&#x27;s &quot;Comic Shop News&quot;, a comics-industry periodical available from many comic shops. The eight strips were colored and lettered by Bendis (before initial colorist/letterer Pat Garrahy became involved) and complemented the up-coming series as a companion piece in newspaper strip form. The strip was later serialized at the online comics magazine PopImage.com.

Debuting with sales of 12,500 (around the &quot;break even&quot; mark for a color comic, although &quot;like ten thousand more&quot; than Bendis&#x27; previous book, &quot;Torso&quot;), &quot;Powers&quot; was faced with an uncertain future, as sales of comics tend to dwindle over subsequent issues. However, Image Comics publisher Jim Valentino and head of marketing Anthony Bozzi both read and enjoyed the first three issues (lettered and laid out by Bendis himself, a hang-over from his earlier fully creator-owned works where he took on the complete roles of several individuals), with Bozzi reportedly saying: &quot;If we can&#x27;t make a book like POWERS sell we really should stop making comics&quot;. Image offered to double-ship the second issue, effectively doubling the orders for that issue as an attempt to boost sales: the gamble worked, and issue #1 was soon reprinted, while according to Bendis, &quot;issues #3–11 saw an upswing&quot; in sales every issue. The reported Diamond pre-order figures show sales climbing above 23,000 by issue #7, and topping 30,000 with issue #14 and stabilizing between 25,000 and 30,000 for the remainder of the titles&#x27; Image run. These strong sales allowed Oeming to quit his job as a security guard, while Bendis&#x27; launch of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; had a positive effect on &quot;Powers&quot;&#x27; sales as readers searched out his comics.

===Move to Icon===
In 2004, Marvel launched a new imprint for creator-owned material, open by invitation only to Marvel creators. &quot;Powers&quot; was (with &quot;Kabuki&quot;) the first series to debut under this new line, in large part due to Bendis&#x27; preeminent role as a Marvel author. The move worked well for the comic, &quot;gain[ing] new readers&quot; in the move from Image to Icon, with the initial issue garnering pre-orders of over 40,000 (and settling around the 30,000 mark with issues #7–8). In part, the move was precipitated by Jim Valentino stepping down as publisher of Image Comics, after having been the driving force in the launch of &quot;Powers&quot; (as well as publishing Bendis&#x27; earlier works &quot;Jinx&quot; and &quot;Torso&quot;). Bendis notes that his relationships with publishers &quot;are always with people, not with logos&quot;.

For their anniversary issue (Volume 2, issue #12 from Icon), Bendis and Oeming had planned to swap roles – Oeming writing and Bendis drawing, but Bendis suffered an injury to his cornea stopping him from drawing the full issue, although he did provide a cover for the issue. Powers Volume 3 launched with issue number one in November 2009. After a year-long hiatus, Powers resumed circulation with Volume 3 #8 on February 8, 2012.

Bendis has a &quot;POWERS idea-list&quot; and the two have &quot;enough stories left in [them], and... the audience to keep the book going&quot; for a while yet. Both have repeatedly stated that they know the ending, not in terms of time frame or issue number, but as a final act of closure, having &quot;promised to never write or draw &quot;Powers&quot; beyond the amount of fresh ideas&quot; they have.

==Inspirations==
* Retro Girl – inspired by &quot;Pearl: The Obsessions and Passions of Janis Joplin&quot;. The first incarnation of Retro Girl&#x27;s name is Janis.
* Olympia – based on Pamela Des Barres&#x27; memories, &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie&quot;, in which she detailed her many liaisons with musicians.
* FG-3 – inspired by The Fugees, of which Bendis is an ardent fan, and whose breakup greatly upset him.
* &quot;Roleplay&quot; – inspired by tribute bands and what Bendis calls &quot;the whole wannabe aspect of life&quot;, coupled with the lifestyle of role-playing gamers.
* &quot;Anarchy&quot; – inspired by punk subculture and the anarchy mindset.
* &quot;Sellouts&quot; – inspired by Bendis&#x27; favorite episodes of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, which focus on bands characterized by strife and conflict among its members, who feel like &quot;outsiders in their own bands&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Powers&quot; is set in a world where superpowers are relatively common but not mundane. It follows the lives of two detectives, Christian Walker and Deena Pilgrim, police officers in a Chicago Homicide department devoted to cases that involve &quot;powers&quot; (people with superpowers). Walker himself used to be a costumed superhero named Diamond, but became a police officer after he lost his abilities.

===Who Killed Retro Girl? (Powers Vol. 1, #1–6)===
The first arc introduces Walker saving a young girl named Calista from a convict with a jetpack. Walker is later introduced to Pilgrim as they investigate their first case, the murder of a popular superhero named Retro Girl, who is found dead outside a school with her throat slit. It was said that she was pregnant with Diamond&#x27;s baby although he was unaware. As the investigation deepens, Deena discovers Walker&#x27;s past as Diamond as well as his relationships with Retro Girl and the controversial superhero Zora.

Issue 7 was a stand-alone issue in which Walker was teamed with famous graphic novelist Warren Ellis.

===Roleplay (Powers Vol. 1, #8–11)===
Walker and Pilgrim investigate a series of murders at a college campus. All of the victims belonged to a roleplaying club in which the members dressed up as superheroes. Evidence suggests the killings are being performed by a notorious supervillain.

===Supergroup (Powers Vol. 1, #15–20)===
Walker and Pilgrim investigate the death of a member of FG-3, a federally employed and corporate funded trio. Evidence leads Walker to believe a federal cover-up is taking place, and as the investigation spirals out of control both professionally and personally (Zora is killed during a confrontation with FG-3), Walker leaves the police force after exposing the cover-up on television.

===Anarchy (Powers Vol. 1, #21–24)===
Pilgrim and her new partner investigate a series of superhero murders being committed by a group claiming inspiration from the killer of Retro Girl. Walker is brought into the case when the leader of the group is arrested and demands to see him, and Pilgrim&#x27;s new partner is killed during an assassination attempt on Walker&#x27;s life. Walker is brought back onto the force after the case is resolved.

===The Sellouts (Powers Vol. 1, #25–30)===
Walker and Pilgrim investigate the murder of a member of the popular superhero team Unity, which had been active in the 1980s but subsequently disbanded.

===Cosmic (Powers Vol. 2, #13–18)===
Walker and Pilgrim investigate the death of a seemingly normal person who is later revealed to be a member of an alien organization called the Millennium Guard.

When he accepts, he is given new powers. Walker also begins a romantic relationship with a witness to the murder.

===Secret Identity (Powers Vol. 2, #19–24)===
Walker and Pilgrim investigate the murder of Queen Noir&#x27;s husband Strike. Queen Noir is the leader of a team called &quot;The Heroes&quot; which had emerged during the Legends Arc. As the investigation continues, more and more members of The Heroes are killed, and evidence points to Queen Noir as the prime suspect. During the case, Pilgrim discovers that Walker has powers, and then disappears.

===The 25 Coolest Dead Superheroes of All Time (Powers Vol. 2, #25–30 and Annual 2008)===
A &quot;Powers Virus&quot; spreads throughout the city, and numerous young girls are falling victim to it. Pilgrim is the primary suspect, as the powers she contracted in the Legends Arc are revealed to be a strain of the virus. Walker attempts to discover the source of the epidemic while Pilgrim does her own investigation. Pilgrim is exonerated when she helps crack the case, and instead of dealing with the bad publicity that revealing all her activities would bring, she is essentially bought off by the city and leaves the force.

===Z (Powers Vol. 3, #1–6)===
A year after the end of the last arc, Walker and his new partner Enki Sunrise investigate the murder of Z, whom Walker teamed up with in World War 2. Sunrise continues her covert Internal Affairs-directed investigation of Walker, but slowly becomes more hesitant to inform on him.

Pilgrim returns to Chicago, now a member of the F.B.I.&#x27;s powers task force.

===Gods (Powers Vol. 3, #7–11)===
After closing the Z case, members of The Golden Ones, a god-like team of heroes, are targeted by a serial killer, with the mother of the murdered Damocles attempting to gain revenge on the world by launching a titanic assault on Chicago. Walker&#x27;s ex-fiancée Heather returns and is killed in a method similar to her visions, and Walker then joins the other powers in battling Damocles&#x27; mother, in defiance of Millennium&#x27;s restrictions on his activities. They succeed in defeating her, but in the aftermath of the battle, Walker, Triphammer and Calista are missing, and all powers-related cases are permanently assigned to the F.B.I., with Captain Cross and Detective Sunrise being hired by the now vastly understaffed bureau.

===All the New Powers (Powers Vol. 4, #1–6)===
Walker and Pilgrim are now faced with the most difficult decision they&#x27;ve ever had to make. Plus: the discovery of a power no one has ever seen before.

===The Best Ever (Powers Vol. 4, #7–8, The Best Ever Graphic Novel)===
Spanning decades and genres while hearkening back to its earliest origins, the story of superhero turned homicide detective Christian Walker comes to a fantastic conclusion. An original graphic novel that incorporates issues #7 and #8 of &quot;Powers&quot;, Vol. 4.

==Characters==
Despite the high mortality rate, there are several recurrent characters in &quot;Powers&quot; beyond the main two. Oeming has praised Bendis&#x27; writing in giving a &quot;real depth&quot; to even minor figures, writing that he particularly enjoys Bendis writing &quot;a character as an asshole and then we [the reader] learn they are more valiant than most of the [other] characters&quot;.
===Main characters===
*Christian Walker – Homicide Detective for the Powers division. Veteran cop Walker was previously a &quot;power&quot; called Diamond before losing his abilities. There are many things about him that are still coming to light (such as his extreme longevity and immortality – &quot;a history that may stretch back to the beginning of humankind&quot;). His contacts with the &quot;Powers&quot; can be both a help and a hindrance to his investigations. Despite his longevity, he &quot;still doesn&#x27;t know how to communicate&quot;, being &quot;locked up in his own brain&quot; in the words of Oeming.
*Deena Pilgrim – beginning as a rookie, Pilgrim started off as a lowly police officer on the streets of Chicago, under a corrupt captain named Adlard (who worked for Mama Joon, a powerful crime boss). Adlard was murdered seven years prior, timing this just before Deena&#x27;s transfer request to work with Walker as part of the Powers Homicide department. Little else is known of her past, though she has revealed that her brother was a Power called &quot;Hoodwink&quot;. Deena&#x27;s character is based in part on Bendis&#x27; wife, and partly on Oeming&#x27;s, who are &quot;both kind of rambunctious, funny, and constantly say[ing] stuff that is shocking&quot;. She was rated as the 24th best comic book character by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine.

===Supporting characters===
*Retro Girl – the first arc details the death of Retro Girl (first name Janis, last name unrevealed), a popular and powerful super-heroine. Retro Girl is in fact a legacy of women – with or without powers – who are continuously reincarnated. Walker has met several incarnations in his lifetime, but he has only vague recollections of them. The latest incarnation is Calista Secor, a young girl he saved.
*Captain Cross – head of the Department, he has known Walker since the 80&#x27;s during and after his stint as the super-hero Diamond. They met when Diamond helped him with a case, the exact nature of which has still to be revealed. It has been noted that Walker&#x27;s job might be a gift from him.
*Detective Kutter – deceased. Bendis once explained that at least one of his characters had to be an id. Kutter is it, rude, crude and at times interfering, but despite his coarse personality he was a good detective, who merely was &quot;constantly saying inappropriate things&quot;. He was killed during the &quot;Legends&quot; arc when an apparently dead &quot;power&quot; killed him.
*Triphammer – real name Harley Cohen, an Iron Man-like character, he chose to disappear after the events of &quot;Who Killed Retro Girl&quot;, in which he kills the man who has been targeting &quot;powers&quot; and was responsible for the death of Retro Girl. He briefly reappears in &quot;Supergroup&quot; after having had extensive plastic surgery, and in &quot;The 25 Coolest Dead Superheroes of All Time&quot; he develops a cure for the Powers virus. It is also revealed in this story arc that he has three daughters, one of which was murdered in this arc. He is the inventor of the &quot;power drainer&quot;, a device capable of temporarily neutralizing the abilities of super-powered individuals. He died in the &quot;Gods&quot; arc.
*Calista Secor, a.k.a. Retro Girl – her character traits are allegedly &quot;based on Mike Oeming&quot;.
*Zora – Deceased. A power, like Christian Walker she appeared to have immortality, but unlike him, she possessed a greater capacity for memory. She and Walker knew each other for years but according to her, for much longer since the time of Ancient China. They were shortly engaged before she was killed by a government-created power known as &quot;Boogie Girl&quot; who went insane. Zora claimed that her abilities came from her complete lack of belief in all things spiritual and her acceptance that she was her own God.

===Cameos===
One of the series&#x27; recurring motifs, which begins in issue #4, is the liberal use of cameos. Investigating their first major crime, Walker and Pilgrim question 32 superheroes (and five pages later, 32 super&quot;villains&quot;) for leads. Described by Bendis as both &quot;one of [his and Oeming&#x27;s] best ideas&quot; and a &quot;&#x27;logistical nightmare&#x27;&quot;, many of these cameo-characters were lent by &quot;well-known comic book creator friends&quot; of Bendis and Oeming to add a level of metatextuality and flesh out the wider Powers universe. In addition to the &quot;brand new super hero and villain creations&quot; solicited, some creators allowed the appearance of their well-established (creator-owned) characters – such as Mike Allred&#x27;s &quot;Madman&quot;, Erik Larsen&#x27;s &quot;Savage Dragon&quot; and Jim Valentino&#x27;s &quot;Shadowhawk&quot;. Other creators who have lent their time and characters to &quot;Powers&quot; include: Angel Medina, Dan Brereton, Paul Jenkins, Neil Vokes, Judd Winick, Jim Krueger, Mike Baron, Phil Jimenez, Scott Morse, Marc Andreyko, Ed Brubaker, Joe Quesada and David Mack.

As the series has progressed, more notable cameo appearances of &quot;real&quot; individuals have to a greater or lesser extent furthered/augmented/commented on the plot. &quot;Powers&quot; issue #7 &quot;Ride Along&quot; introduced author Warren Ellis into the Powers universe, as a writer of &quot;graphic novels&quot; who accompanies Walker on a &quot;ride along&quot; for research purposes. The &quot;Powers&quot; Ellis discusses the domination of the comics industry by superheroes and the medium of comics itself, before being revealed at the end of the issue, in a super-metatextual moment, as the author of the in-&quot;Powers&quot;-universe comic entitled &quot;Powers&quot;. In issue #23, an analogue of Dark Horse Comics editor Diana Schutz is interviewed on the problematic nature of vigilante superheroes who exist above the normal system of law, and why non-powered individuals might feel betrayed by, wary or resentful of them.

===Covers===
In his introduction to the bonus materials section of &quot;Powers: Roleplay&quot;, Bendis highlights five Superhero comic cover clichés, and then explains that &quot;Mike and I decided very early on to create theme covers for each storyarc&quot;. &quot;Roleplay&quot; (issues #8–11)&#x27;s theme used &quot;album cover designs from albums you would find in a college dorm room&quot;. The covers homaged were:
* Issue #8 – Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, original drawn by Robert Crumb
* Issue #9 – The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (UK release)
* Issue #10 – Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;
* Issue #11 – The Beatles&#x27; &quot;The Beatles/&#x27;The White Album&#x27;&quot;
Issues #12–14 (collected in &quot;Little Deaths&quot;) were drawn in the style of trashy gossip/celebrity tabloid magazines. The covers were styled after the following magazines:
* Issue #12 – &quot;People&quot;
* Issue #13 – &quot;Hello!&quot;
* Issue #14 – &quot;Globe&quot;
** The &quot;Powers&quot; website – – is modelled after &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;E! Online&quot;.
Other covers are homages to a number of things, including:
* Issue #26 – Alex Toth&#x27;s rendition of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Super Friends&quot;

Under Icon, some of Volume 2&#x27;s covers have been drawn in the style of various classic movie posters, specifically #7–10.

==Daily strip==
The first through fourth story arcs, &quot;Who Killed Retro Girl?&quot;, &quot;Roleplay&quot;, &quot;Little Deaths&quot; and &quot;Supergroup&quot;, were published online in a daily page-per-day format, and the fifth arc, &quot;Anarchy&quot;, was being released but has since ceased its release days. The story &quot;Little Deaths&quot; is also incomplete:
* &quot;Who Killed Retro Girl?&quot;
* &quot;Roleplay&quot;
* &quot;Little Deaths&quot;
* &quot;Supergroup&quot;
* &quot;Anarchy&quot;

==Recognition and influence==
The series won the Eisner Award for Best New Series for 2001 and Brian Michael Bendis won the Best Writer Eisner Award in 2002 and 2003.

Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker, whom Bendis and Oeming view as &quot;amazing crime writers&quot;, created &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, which Bendis and Oeming view as one of many &quot;Powers&quot;-like comics influenced by their work. Bendis notes that Rucka and Brubaker gave himself and Oeming a &quot;heads up&quot; that they were preparing a &quot;cop book in the DC Universe&quot; and entirely separate from the plethora of titles which seem to merely be attempting to ape &quot;Powers&quot;.

==Television adaptation==

A television adaptation of &quot;Powers&quot; premiered on the PlayStation Network, the PSN&#x27;s first original programming.
Two seasons were produced.

<doc id="692479" wikidata="Q13412574" url="?curid=692479" title="Triple Crown (rugby union)">
<text>In rugby union, the Triple Crown is an honour contested annually by the &quot;Home Nations&quot; – i.e. England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales who compete within the larger Six Nations Championship. If any one of these teams defeat all three other teams, they win the Triple Crown.

The Six Nations Championship also includes France and Italy, but their involvement in the tournament has no influence on the result of the Triple Crown, although it means that the winners of the Triple Crown are not necessarily the winners of the Championship as a whole.

England won the first Triple Crown – although the phrase was not in use at the time – in the inaugural 1883 series of the original rugby union Home Nations Championship. The latest winners of the Triple Crown are Ireland, who won it by beating Wales at the Principality Stadium in the 2025 Six Nations Championship.

Traditionally the Triple Crown was an informal honour with no trophy associated with it. However a trophy now exists, which has been awarded to Triple Crown winners since 2006.

==Name==

The origins of the name &quot;Triple Crown&quot; are uncertain. The concept dates to the original Home Nations Championship, predecessor of the Six Nations Championship, when the competition only involved England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Like the modern Grand Slam, the Triple Crown was an informal honour to a team that won the Championship with straight victories.

The first use cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is from &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, 1900 (referring to the 1899 tournament): &quot;In their last match at Cardiff against Wales, Ireland won by a try to nothing, securing the triple crown with three straight victories as in 1894.&quot; The Irish victory in 1894 was reported as a Triple Crown by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; at the time and is possibly the first time the phrase was seen in print.

The phrase &quot;Triple Crown&quot; is also used in a number of other sports.

==Trophy history==
Until 2006, no actual trophy was awarded to the winner of the Triple Crown, hence it was sometimes referred to as the &quot;invisible cup&quot;. Dave Merrington, a retired miner from South Hetton, County Durham, fashioned an aspiring trophy in 1975 from a lump of coal hewn from the Haig Colliery in Cumbria. This has a crown sitting on a four-sided base on which are represented a rose, a shamrock, a thistle and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers. It is kept in the Museum of Rugby at Twickenham.

For the 2006 Six Nations, the Royal Bank of Scotland (the primary sponsor of the competition) commissioned Edinburgh and London based Hamilton &amp; Inches to design and create a dedicated Triple Crown Trophy. This has been awarded to Triple Crown winning sides since 2006. It has been won seven times by Ireland, four times by Wales and three times by England.

==Winners==

There has been a Triple Crown winner in 72 of the 129 competitions held from 1883 through to 2025 (twelve years of competition were not played due to the two World Wars). The 2025 campaign was the most recent edition when Ireland won the crown; Ireland also won the most recent Triple Crown prior to 2025, in the 2023 campaign.

Wales and England have both retained the Triple Crown for four consecutive years: Wales (1976–1979) and England (1995–1998). Scotland and Ireland have never won the Triple Crown for more than two successive Championships.

It is possible to win the Triple Crown without also winning that year&#x27;s Championship. France and Italy may win either the tournament or Grand Slam while a home nation completes the Triple Crown and on rare occasions, it is possible for one home nation to win the Triple Crown, while another claims the Championship title (but not the Grand Slam). To date, the Triple Crown winners who failed to win the Championship are Wales in 1977, England in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2014, and Ireland in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2022. The champions were France on each occasion, apart from 2014 when Ireland were Six Nations champions despite losing to Triple Crown winners England, the first instance of a team winning the Triple Crown but losing the overall title to another team eligible for it.

Triple Crown winners who succeeded only in sharing the Championship were England in 1954 (lost to France, shared the title with France and Wales) and 1960 (drew with France and shared the title with them), and Wales in 1988 (lost to France and shared the title with them). With the advent of game points, bonus points and points difference, sharing the Championship is no longer possible.

The following table shows the number of Triple Crown wins by each country, and the years and Championship formats in which they were achieved.

<doc id="692492" wikidata="Q7328699" url="?curid=692492" title="Richard Robinson (Municipal Reform politician)">
<text>Sir Richard Atkinson Robinson DL JP (16 October 1849 – 28 April 1928) was a retail chemist and druggist who later became a local politician, and was the first member of the Municipal Reform Party (linked to the Conservatives) to lead the London County Council (1907–1908).

==Early life==

He was the eldest son of a family engaged in the owning and operating of sailing ships in Whitby. His father died when he was 18, and with four sisters and four younger brothers, there was no money for expensive higher education.

He apprenticed himself to a chemist and druggist in Bootle, migrating to a Kensington firm in 1870 and qualifying for registration in 1872. The firm&#x27;s owner died and he bought it, going on to acquire also a shop in Tunbridge Wells and later a fashionable pharmacy near St. James&#x27;s Palace. 

As a chemist and druggist, he could not become a full member of the Pharmaceutical Society, but in 1898 he and others in the same position became able to do so under an amending Act of Parliament which he had actively promoted. He subsequently became a member of the society&#x27;s council and served as president in 1904–1907. He was instrumental in securing the drafting and adoption of compulsory poison regulations in 1899.

==Local government==

He was always active in local affairs. He became chairman of the Tunbridge Wells Tradesmen&#x27;s Association and was a Town Councillor there; an Alderman in Kensington; a Deputy Lieutenant in the County of London and a Justice of the Peace both there and in the North Riding of Yorkshire; a Governor of the Imperial College of Science; a member of the board of the Thames Conservancy; an Income Tax Commissioner, and a cofounder and first chairman of the Society of Yorkshiremen in London. He turned down the mayoralties of both Tunbridge Wells and Kensington.

He was also elected to the London County Council as one of the &quot;Moderates&quot; (linked to the Conservatives) who opposed the &quot;Progressive&quot; (linked to the Liberals) majority. He served as deputy chairman of the council in 1903–04, and was leader of the &quot;Municipal Reform Party&quot; (the more active title assumed by the Moderates) in 1907 when, in a bitterly fought election, they won a remarkable majority against what they denounced as the Progressives&#x27; extravagance and wastefulness. After forming the first Municipal Reform administration, he served as chairman of the council in 1908–09. He was knighted in 1916, the first time that (as a result of the formation of the wartime coalition government) the Conservative Party could honour the success he had helped to achieve in 1907.

==Later life==
During the First World War, he retired from business, serving as vice-chairman of the London Tribunal on Profiteering. In 1920 he moved back to Whitby where he became chairman of the urban district council.

==Family==
In 1876 he married Jane Thistle of another Whitby family, and in 1926 they celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, as her parents and grandparents and his grandparents had done and as one of their sons and four of their grandchildren did later. He helped his children get better education than he had done and all his sons attended university or took equivalent professional qualifications, while his eldest daughter graduated at the London School of Economics and lectured there before the First World War.

His grandson, through his daughter Alice, was diplomat James Bottomley.

==Death==
He died on 28 April 1928 in Whitby, survived by his widow, three daughters and two sons. (Two other sons predeceased him, having been killed in action during WWI.)

<text>Edward Douglass White Jr. (November 3, 1845 – May 19, 1921) was an American politician and jurist. A native of Louisiana, White was a U.S. Supreme Court justice for 27 years, first as an associate justice from 1894 to 1910, then as the ninth chief justice from 1910 until his death in 1921.

Born in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, White practiced law in New Orleans after graduating from the University of Louisiana, now Tulane University. He also attended the College of the Immaculate Conception, present-day Jesuit High School in New Orleans, class of 1865. His father, Edward Douglass White Sr., was the 10th Governor of Louisiana and a Whig US Representative. White fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War and was captured in 1865. After the war, White won election to the Louisiana State Senate and served on the Louisiana Supreme Court. As a member of the Democratic Party, White represented Louisiana in the United States Senate from 1891 to 1894.

In 1894, President Grover Cleveland appointed White as an associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1910, President William Howard Taft elevated him to the position of chief justice. The appointment surprised many contemporaries, as Taft was a member of the Republican Party. White served as chief justice until his death in 1921, when he was succeeded by Taft.

White sided with the Supreme Court majority in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, upholding the legality of state segregation to provide &quot;separate but equal&quot; public facilities in the United States. White would go on to write notable opinions in landmark cases such as &quot;Talton v. Mayes&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock&quot;, &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot;, and the &quot;Selective Draft Law Cases&quot;.

==Early life and education==
White was born on November 3, 1845, on his family&#x27;s sugar plantation near Thibodaux, Louisiana, about thirty miles to the west of New Orleans. His father, Edward Douglass White Sr., was a lawyer and judge who had served as a U.S. Representative and as the governor of Louisiana. The elder White retired from Congress in 1843; his sugar plantation utilized dozens of slaves. His wife was Catherine Sidney Lee Ringgold, the daughter of influential Washington, D.C., businessman and politician Tench Ringgold; she was a descendant of the Lee family, and the future chief justice was thus distantly related to Confederate general Robert E. Lee. The couple had five children, of whom White Jr. was the youngest son. In April 1847, before his namesake son had reached his third birthday, White Sr. died. His wife remarried in 1850, wedding French-Canadian immigrant merchant Andre Brousseau. The family moved to New Orleans the subsequent year.

White attended a Jesuit school in New Orleans beginning at the age of six. Starting in 1856, he and his brother attended Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College, near Emmitsburg, Maryland. White enrolled in 1858 at Georgetown University, which biographer Robert Baker Highsaw characterized as &quot;probably the best Catholic institution of higher learning in the United States&quot;. It was distinctly Jesuit as well; university president John Early and a majority of the faculty were all members of the Society of Jesus. White&#x27;s Jesuit training influenced his legal philosophy later in life, leading him to emphasize formal logical reasoning. At Georgetown, he studied the classics, the flute, and the violin; he also participated in the school&#x27;s cadet corp. After the American Civil War broke out, White left Georgetown without a degree, returning home.

==Confederate soldier and Ku Klux Klan membership==
White&#x27;s studies at Georgetown were interrupted by the Civil War. He enlisted in the Confederate States Army and served under General Richard Taylor, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant.

An apocryphal account states that White was almost captured by Union troops near Bayou Lafourche in October 1862, but that he evaded capture by hiding beneath hay in a barn. It is possible that White enlisted in the Lafourche Parish militia, as its muster rolls are not complete. There is no documentation, however, that White served in any Confederate volunteer unit or militia unit engaged in campaigns in the Lafourche area.

Another account suggests that he was assigned as an aide to Confederate General William Beall and accompanied him to Port Hudson, Louisiana, which was besieged and captured by Union troops in 1863. White&#x27;s presence at Port Hudson, when he was 18 years old, is supported by a secondhand account of a postwar dinner conversation he had with Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota, a Union veteran of Port Hudson, and another recounted by Admiral George Dewey (then a Federal naval officer at Port Hudson), in both of which White referred to being part of the besieged forces. But White&#x27;s name does not appear on any list of prisoners captured at Port Hudson. According to another account of questionable reliability, White was supposedly sent to a Mississippi prisoner of war camp. As practically all Confederate soldiers of enlisted rank of the Port Hudson garrison were paroled, and officers sent to prison in New Orleans and later to Johnson&#x27;s Island, Ohio, this account is likely not true. When White was paroled, he supposedly returned to the family plantation to find it abandoned, the canefields barren, and the place nearly empty of most of its former slaves.

The only documented evidence of White&#x27;s Confederate service consists of an account of his capture on March 12, 1865, in an action in Morganza in Pointe Coupee Parish, which is contained in the Official Records of the American Civil War, and his service records in the National Archives, noting his subsequent imprisonment in New Orleans and parole in April 1865. These records confirm his service as a lieutenant in Captain W. B. Barrow&#x27;s company of a Louisiana cavalry regiment, for all practical purposes a loosely organized band of irregulars or &quot;scouts&quot; (guerrillas). One organizing officer of this regiment, which was sometimes called &quot;Barrow&#x27;s Regiment&quot; or the &quot;9th Louisiana Cavalry Regiment,&quot; was Major Robert Pruyn. Pruyn (a postwar mayor of Baton Rouge, Louisiana) served as courier relaying messages from Port Hudson&#x27;s commander, General Franklin Gardner, to General Joseph E. Johnston, crossing the Union siege lines by swimming the Mississippi. Pruyn escaped from Port Hudson prior to its surrender in the same manner. According to another account, after White was paroled in April 1865 and following the surrender of the western Confederate forces, he ended his military career by walking (his clothing in rags) to a comrade&#x27;s family home in Livonia in Pointe Coupee Parish.

White&#x27;s Civil War service was taken as a matter of common knowledge at the time of his initial nomination to the United States Supreme Court, and the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; periodical, published for the United Confederate Veterans, congratulated him upon his confirmation. White was one of three ex-Confederate soldiers to serve on the Supreme Court. The others were associate justices Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar of Mississippi and Horace Harmon Lurton of Tennessee. The Court&#x27;s other ex-Confederate, Associate Justice Howell Edmunds Jackson, had held a civil position under the Confederate government.

White&#x27;s membership in the Ku Klux Klan is a matter of contention. Some authors, such Michael Newton, claim White was a &quot;Reconstruction Era Klansman.&quot; Other reports question whether there is enough evidence to support that claim, though noting that membership in secret societies such as the KKK can be difficult to document.

According to biographer Paul Finkelman:
:Although the moviemaker D. W. Griffith claimed White endorsed his racist movie, &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), and asserted that White had been in the Ku Klux Klan, there is no evidence to support either of Griffith&#x27;s contentions.

However, Griffith claimed that when he met White, and told White of the subject matter of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, White said &quot;I was a member of the Klan, sir.&quot; Griffith then arranged a screening of his film for the nine members of the Supreme Court and members of Congress.

In 1877, White served on the Reception Committee of the Knights of Momus in New Orleans. The Knights&#x27; Mardi Gras parade was an attack on Reconstruction so extreme that it was widely condemned, and even denounced by the Krewe of Rex.

==Political career==

While living on his family&#x27;s abandoned plantation, White began his legal studies. He enrolled at the University of Louisiana in New Orleans to complete his study of the law, at what is now known as Tulane University Law School. He subsequently was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in New Orleans in 1868. He was also mentored as a young attorney by Edouard Bermudez, a New Orleans lawyer who later served as chief justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court.

White served in the Louisiana State Senate in 1874, a year marked by interracial violence in political campaigns and elections. He also served on the Louisiana Supreme Court from 1878 to 1880. In 1891, the State Legislature elected him to the United States Senate to succeed James B. Eustis. During his time in state politics, White was politically affiliated with two-time governor Francis T. Nicholls (1876–1880; 1888–1892), a former Confederate general. He was Nicholls&#x27; campaign manager in the 1888 Louisiana gubernatorial election, which was riddled with fraud and the intimidation of African American voters to ensure Nicholls&#x27; election. 
==United States Supreme Court==
===Associate justice===
White was nominated by President Grover Cleveland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on February 19, 1894, after the Senate had rejected his first two nominees: William B. Hornblower and Wheeler Hazard Peckham. In contrast to those nominations, the Senate confirmed White the same day on a voice vote. He took the judicial oath of office a few weeks later, March 12, 1894.

In 1896, White was a part of the 7–1 majority in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities as long as the segregated facilities were equal in quality. He also participated in the Insular Cases of the early 20th century regarding the relationship of the United States to its territories acquired in the Spanish–American War, where he concurred with the 5–4 decision in &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; (1901) that the newly-annexed territories were not properly part of the United States for purposes of the Constitution in several ways. However, wrote White, the constitutional guarantees of a citizen&#x27;s rights of liberty and property were applicable to all and &quot;cannot be under any circumstances transcended.&quot;

===Chief justice===
On December 12, 1910, President William Howard Taft nominated White to become Chief Justice of the United States, following the death of Melville Fuller. The appointment was unusual, as White was the first incumbent associate justice to be appointed as chief justice. (John Rutledge, a former associate justice, had been given a recess appointment as chief justice in 1795). The wisdom of elevating an associate justice to chief justice was questioned, as were Taft&#x27;s motives for selecting White. Nonetheless, the Senate confirmed White the same day, and again on a voice vote. He became the nation&#x27;s ninth chief justice on December 19, 1910.

White was generally seen as one of the more conservative members of the court. He originated the term &quot;Rule of Reason.&quot; He also joined the Hammer v. Dagenhart decision, ruling that the federal government could not ban child labor. However, White also wrote the 1916 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Adamson Act, which mandated a maximum eight-hour work day for railroad employees. White&#x27;s background as a Democrat, Confederate veteran and Southern lawyer might have predicted legal positions that would have sought to curtail federal power. Yet, surprisingly, White articulated nationalist positions in his decisions, much like President Taft. He supported expanded regulation and taxation by Congress. He was usually conservative in racial issues, as were most justices. However, he wrote the majority decisions in favor of civil rights in important cases. Late in life, he expressed sorrow at the entire Civil War experience and his role in it.

As chief justice at a time when the Court&#x27;s work was carried out with more than 8,000 cases brought each year before the court, and only a few clerks to work for all the members of the Court, White held weekly meetings with fellow jurists, assigned all the cases and wrote the majority opinions in 711 cases, as well as 155 dissenting opinions, all opposing income taxes. He wrote for a unanimous Court in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; (1915), which invalidated the Oklahoma and Maryland grandfather clauses (and, by extension, those in other Southern states) as &quot;repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore null and void.&quot; Nevertheless, Southern states quickly devised other methods to continue their disfranchisement of blacks (and in some cases, many poor whites) that withstood Court scrutiny.

In 1918, the &quot;Selective Draft Law Cases&quot; upheld the Selective Service Act of 1917, and more generally, upheld conscription in the United States, which President Taft said was &quot;one of his great opinions.&quot;

During his tenure as chief justice, White swore in presidents Woodrow Wilson (twice) and Warren G. Harding. At the time of his death on May 21, 1921, he had served on the Court for a total of years, of them as chief justice. He was succeeded by former president Taft, who had elevated White to the chief justice seat and had long desired the seat himself.

==Personal life and death==
White married Leita Montgomery Kent, the widow of Linden Kent, on November 6, 1894, in New York City. His wife was the daughter of Romonzo and Virginia High Montgomery; White proposed to her before her first marriage but was turned down, and proposed again after her first husband died in 1892.

White&#x27;s paternal ancestors were of Irish Catholic descent, and he was reared in that religion, a Roman Catholic his entire life.

White died from a sudden heart attack on May 19, 1921, at the age of 75. He is buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>Mega Man 5 is a 1992 action-platform game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the fifth game in the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series and was released in Japan on December 4, 1992. It saw a release during the same month in North America and in 1993 in Europe.

Taking place after the events of &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;, Mega Man&#x27;s brother and ally Proto Man leads a group of menacing robots in attacks on the world and kidnaps his creator Dr. Light, forcing Mega Man to fight against his brother. &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.

&quot;Mega Man 5&quot; was met with a positive critical reception for its graphics, difficulty, and music, while receiving criticism for its lack of innovation in its plot or gameplay. Like previous games in the series, &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; was remade for PlayStation in Japan. It later appeared on mobile phones, and become part of game collections, including &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot;. It has also been released through Virtual Console and PlayStation Network in emulated form. Two follow-ups were developed at the same time and released in 1993: &quot;Mega Man 6&quot;, a direct sequel for NES, and &quot;Mega Man X&quot;, a spin-off for Super Nintendo, and start of its own game series.

==Plot==
&quot;Mega Man 5&quot; takes place during the 21st century, about two months after the events of &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;, when the mad scientist Dr. Wily once again attempted to take over the world. Proto Man, secret brother and once ally to the world&#x27;s greatest hero Mega Man, leads an army of robots in a series of destructive attacks on the world. To cripple the world&#x27;s defenders, he kidnaps his own creator, the genius scientist Dr. Light. Mega Man wonders why Proto Man is doing this, but with little choice left, he sets out to stop him, assisted by Beat, a robot bird gifted to him by Dr. Cossack.

Mega Man prevails over a new group of eight powerful &quot;Robot Masters&quot; working under Proto Man: Star Man, Gravity Man, Gyro Man, Stone Man, Crystal Man, Charge Man, Napalm Man, and Wave Man. Mega Man then makes his way to Proto Man&#x27;s fortress and confronts his fellow creation, who nearly destroys the protagonist in the process. However, a second Proto Man arrives just in time, revealing the first as an imposter: Dark Man, one of Dr. Wily&#x27;s newest robots. Mega Man defeats the impostor, then pursues Wily to his newest hideout, defeats him, and saves Dr. Light. However, the fortress begins collapsing, and while Mega Man is distracted from holding up the ceiling from crushing himself and Dr. Light, Wily manages yet another retreat. Just after Wily escapes, a familiar whistle is heard, and part of the ceiling is blasted away, allowing Mega Man and Dr. Light to also escape. As the two watch the castle collapse from a distance, their mystery savior is revealed to be the real Proto Man, who quietly slips off unnoticed.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mega Man 5&quot; is an action-platform game that is very similar to previous titles in the series. Gameplay revolves around the player using the central character Mega Man to run, jump, and shoot his way through a set of stages. If the player takes damage, Mega Man&#x27;s life meter can be refilled by picking up energy capsules scattered about each level or from fallen enemies. Mega Man&#x27;s default Mega Buster arm cannon can be fired an unlimited number of times. The Mega Buster&#x27;s charge feature, introduced in &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;, has been upgraded to allow its powerful, charged shots to encompass a slightly wider area. Each stage ends with a boss battle with a Robot Master; destroying that Robot Master lets the player copy its special &quot;Master Weapon&quot;, which can be toggled and used throughout the remainder of the game. Unlike the Mega Buster, Master Weapons require weapon energy to use and must be replenished if it is depleted in the same selected stage. Other power-ups including extra lives, &quot;Energy Tanks&quot;, and a new &quot;Mystery Tank&quot;, which fully refills health and all item power, can be picked up as well.

After completing certain stages, the player can call on Mega Man&#x27;s faithful dog Rush to reach higher platforms or cross large gaps using his &quot;Coil&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot; transformations. These abilities require refills with the same weapon energy that Master Weapons use. Some of the level designs in &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; are different from earlier games in the series. For example, in Gravity Man&#x27;s stage, the gravitation is reversed from the floor to the ceiling, while in Wave Man&#x27;s stage, the player drives a water craft from the halfway point to the boss room. Hidden within each of the eight Robot Master stages is a collectible circuit board. Gathering all eight of these boards (spelling &quot;M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V&quot; in English versions or &quot;R-O-C-K-M-A-N-5&quot; in the Japanese version) gives the player access to a robot-bird friend by the name of Beat. The player can then call on Beat to attack any onscreen enemies.

==Development==
&quot;Mega Man 5&quot; was developed by Capcom. Having had major involvement in the development in all prior &quot;Mega Man&quot; games, artist Keiji Inafune, credited as &quot;Inafking&quot;, worked under a new project leader for &quot;Mega Man 5&quot;. As with past entries in the series, Inafune used his experience to guide his supervisor and the other team members. He did this in order to avoid making what he considered to be an &quot;unreasonable game, [...] an affront to the players&quot;. As a result of this leadership, Inafune felt &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; turned out with a lower difficulty level. The team already felt they had accomplished all the gameplay they could with the release of &quot;Mega Man 4&quot;, so they decided to simply &quot;introduce powered up versions of everything&quot;, such as the Mega Buster. After working diligently on the fourth installment of the series and being the man behind the concept of the chargeable Mega Buster, Hayato Kaji, credited as &quot;H.K&quot;, was called in to help out during the middle of &quot;Mega Man 5&quot;&#x27;s development. The game was &quot;taking a while to come together&quot; at that point according to Kaji. Inafune summarized his work on &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; as being fun, but he admitted having trouble with the designs, balance, and colors.

In a new direction Capcom held a contest in collaboration with Nintendo Power Magazine requesting submissions for new villain characters, the eight Robot Master bosses in &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; are a result of fans sending in their own designs to Capcom. Capcom received over 130,000 character submissions for the game. Inafune recounted having a difficult time getting approval on the chosen bosses, having had to re-illustrate them several times. However, the artist had little trouble in designing Beat, whose first draft was accepted by Inafune&#x27;s superiors. The idea for Beat originated in the development of &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, where the concept support robots included a dog and bird. The team chose to keep the dog character as Rush for this earlier game, while the bird would serve as the basis for the character Beat in &quot;Mega Man 5&quot;. The musical score of &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; was composed by Mari Yamaguchi (credited as &quot;Mari&quot;).

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Mega Man 5&quot; has enjoyed generally positive reactions from printed and online publications. Many critics were complimentary of the game&#x27;s graphics, music, play control, and challenge level. IGN&#x27;s Lucas M. Thomas holds &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; as one of his favorite entries in the series and, because of its lowered difficulty compared to its predecessors, considers it the easiest of the bunch to casually pick up and play through. IGN lists &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; as the 84th best game on the NES.

Like other sequels in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; has suffered criticism for its lack of innovative gameplay and storytelling. GamePro summarized the game as &quot;déjà vu all over again for disciples of the series&quot; and that &quot;Capcom must get some kind of cash rebate for recycling video games&quot;. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish considered &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; as &quot;a painfully phoned-in episode lacking not only innovation, but pretty much all the polish and balance that made the earlier games so enjoyable&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; was re-released for the PlayStation as part of the Japan-exclusive &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot; series. It featured a helpful &quot;navi mode&quot; for beginners, arranged music, encyclopedia modes, and artwork. A port of this version with fewer extras was released in North America for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube in 2004 and Xbox in 2005 as part of &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot;. Another port of the game was released in Japan in 2007 for mobile phones compatible with Yahoo! Mobile and EZweb applications. Finally, in 2011, the NES version was made available on the Wii Virtual Console service in both Japan and North America, and the PlayStation Network in Japan. It has also been released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console as well as the 3DS eShop.

<doc id="692508" wikidata="Q3235856" url="?curid=692508" title="Mega Man Zero">
<text>is an action-platform game series in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man&quot; video game franchise. It was developed by Inti Creates, with Co-Producer Keiji Inafune and Director Yoshinori Kawano. The series consists of four games that were first released on the Game Boy Advance and later on the Nintendo DS and the Virtual Console (Wii U).

The story plays 100 years after(22XX) the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; storyline and follows the re-awakened Zero, who is fighting in a war between humans and Reploids, self-aware, human-like robots who are oppressed and hunted down by mankind due to a worldwide energy shortage crisis. Together with the human scientist Ciel, Zero helps the Reploid resistance survive and fights against other Reploids sent by mankind to destroy them. However, this is only the setup for the story and events change drastically throughout the series.

== Gameplay ==
Similar to the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series, the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series is a two-dimensional action platform game with run and gun elements that places a heavy emphasis on memorizing boss patterns and selecting the correct weapons to use against enemies.

Unlike the previous series, the stages of &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; are inside of areas that are part of a larger map, and the player can freely explore these areas once the respective mission(s) in each area is completed. However, &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; and later entries removed this and returned to the traditional Mega Man format that allowed the player to select a mission from a stage select screen.

The game mechanics slightly change with every entry of the series. Zero is given a variety of weapons to use and can level them up to unlock new abilities, although this was removed from &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; and onward as the abilities become accessible from the start of the game.

A new entry in the series was the Score and Level System, which gives the player a score out of 100 and its corresponding level depending on how well they performed on each mission. The series also introduces the Cyber-Elf system, which allows Zero to equip small helper beings known as &quot;Cyber Elves&quot; to assist him in combat. After feeding them with a certain amount of E-Crystals that are dropped by enemies, the elves can either provide permanent enhancements—such as increasing Zero&#x27;s maximum health capacity, or grant temporary benefits—such as the ability to deflect bullets for a short time. However, the score at the end of each mission will decrease for every Cyber-Elf used.

Finally, Zero&#x27;s weapons receive elemental enhancements in every game except &quot;Mega Man Zero 4&quot;. Acting like a rock-paper-scissors system, Zero gains three element chips (Fire, Ice, Thunder) that can be attached to all his weapons and changed freely. Doing so adds elemental effects to his charge attacks and inflict higher damage to bosses weak to the selected element, or no damage if they are immune to it.

== Plot ==
=== &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; ===
Centuries after disappearing at the end of the Mega Man X series, Zero is found and awakened by Ciel, a 12-year old human scientist. Zero, unsure of who he is due to temporary memory loss, protects Ciel and her band of Reploids from a group sent out to destroy them.
During the events of the game, as Zero fights off several attempts to destroy the remaining Reploids, it is unveiled what happened during his 100-year absence: After the Maverick War that took place during the Mega Man X series - where humans were being purged by malevolent Reploids, known as Mavericks - drew to a close with the Mavericks suffering total defeat, humans and Reploids were able to live in harmony in a utopian state known as Neo Arcadia. Unfortunately, this peace was short-lived due to the energy shortage crisis which led to the murdering of countless innocent Reploids to reduce energy consumption. Ciel thus banded with the Reploids and founded the Resistance. It is also revealed that a copy of X - Zero&#x27;s former ally and best friend - is the leader of Neo Arcadia and the mastermind behind the Reploid genocide.
After defeating the Four Guardians - Copy X&#x27;s right-hand generals - Zero eventually confronts Copy X and defeats him in battle. While dying, Copy X self-destructs and Zero barely manages to escape. He then finds himself in an endless desert, surrounded by Neo Arcadian troops. Knowing that Neo Arcadia will focus their attention on him, Zero decides to stay in the desert and fight endlessly in hopes of giving Ciel and the resistance the time needed to escape.

=== &quot;Mega Man Zero 2&quot; ===

Set one year after the events of the first game, it is revealed that Zero has been hunting down Neo Arcadian forces in the desert. After defeating yet another group of Neo Arcadian forces, Zero finally collapses due to exhaustion. However, because of unknown reasons, he is rescued by Harpuia, one of Four Guardians and now leader of Neo Arcadia. Although they are enemies, Harpuia brings Zero to a location near the Resistance Base, where he is eventually found by the Resistance members and repaired by Cerveau.

While Ciel tries to develop a new energy source to end the war, the new leader of the Resistance, Elpizo, instead prepares for a head-on invasion on Neo Arcadia. The invasion results in total failure, with Elpizo being the only survivor. Frustrated by his powerlessness, he leaves the Resistance to search for the Dark Elf, a powerful, malevolent Cyber-Elf that brought unparalleled destruction to Earth during the Elf Wars - an event that happened during Zero&#x27;s 100-year absence.

Elpizo eventually revives the Dark Elf by finding and destroying the original Mega Man X&#x27;s physical body, which acted as a seal to keep the Dark Elf contained. Elpizo absorbs the Dark Elf to obtain a colossal amount of power but is narrowly defeated by Zero. The game ends with the Dark Elf escaping and the original X — now a Cyber-Elf — telling Zero that the Dark Elf was once known as the Mother Elf, whose original purpose was to cure the Maverick Virus — which turned Reploids into Mavericks — in order to end the Maverick War during the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; series.

=== &quot;Mega Man Zero 3&quot; ===

Two months have passed since Elpizo&#x27;s defeat, with the Dark Elf&#x27;s location still unknown. During this time, Ciel has finished her research on a new energy supply that allowed virtually unlimited energy generation, which was dubbed the &quot;Ciel System&quot;. While en route to Neo Arcadia to propose the Ciel System in hopes of making peace as there would no longer be a reason to continue the genocide on the Reploids, a large spaceship with the Dark Elf&#x27;s energy reading crashes to Earth.
Zero is sent out to investigate and find out more about the energy reading, but instead, finds the remaining three Four Guardians fighting against a gigantic Reploid named Omega and encounters an accompanying scientist named Dr. Weil — both who were banished to space for life due to their crimes in instigating the Elf Wars by corrupting the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf. Dr Weil then reveals that he had resurrected Copy X, who then resumes his reign in Neo Arcadia and forces the Four Guardians to submit to Dr Weil&#x27;s will and subsequently demotes them. The Four Guardians, suspecting that Copy X is being heavily influenced by Weil, leave the Neo Arcadian army.
The Dark Elf soon reappears in a human residential district in Neo Arcadia. Wishing to capture it, Dr. Weil and Copy X authorise a missile to be launched at the district to incapacitate the Dark Elf. Although successful in capturing the Dark Elf, the missile attack causes thousands of innocent human casualties. Following this nefarious event, Ciel rescinds her offer to propose the Ciel System, leading Dr. Weil and Copy X to brand the Resistance as Mavericks and subsequently launch an all-out invasion against the Resistance. The Resistance is able to delay the invasion until Zero reaches Copy X and kills him once more, thus making the invasion lose steam. However, Dr. Weil then succeeds Copy X as the new ruler of Neo Arcadia and announces his true intention for capturing the Dark Elf, which is to fuse the Dark Elf with Omega and link them with a colossal frequency transmitter that would enable Omega to control the minds of every Reploid on Earth. Dr. Weil justifies this as vengeance against both humanity and Reploids for his exile in space.
Zero eventually confronts and kills Omega in two different forms, but Omega then reveals his true form — a body that looks exactly like Zero. Weil appears in the background and reveals that while Zero was powered down during his 100-year hibernation, he had transferred Zero&#x27;s conscience and memories to a copy body and then stole Zero&#x27;s original body to be used by Omega due to its unmatched fighting abilities. Despite the revelation of this fact, Zero, with assistance from the Four Guardians, destroys his original body and kills Omega for good. Omega&#x27;s death results in a large explosion, which releases the Dark Elf from Omega and frees it from Weil&#x27;s corruption. X tells the truth about Zero and his body to the Resistance before disappearing forever. The Dark Elf, now known as the Mother Elf once more, brings Zero back to the Resistance Base, before it too disappears, ending the game.

=== &quot;Mega Man Zero 4&quot; ===

Despite Omega being destroyed, Weil continued his revenge on humans and Reploids alike and assumed a dictatorial reign over Neo Arcadia and stripped much of its citizens&#x27; rights, leading many humans to flee and start their own settlements. In response, Weil labelled the escapees as Mavericks and began to purge them just like the Reploids.

The game starts with Zero, Ciel, and the Resistance members encountering a group of humans fleeing from Weil&#x27;s forces. Zero protects the humans, who then reveal to the Resistance that they are headed towards a large, nature-filled settlement in Area Zero, the location where the Eurasia colony crashed during the events of &quot;Mega Man X5&quot; more than 100 years ago.

The large population of settlements like Area Zero attracts Weil&#x27;s attention, who reveals a plan to use a meteor-sized space cannon called Ragnarok to vaporize all nature and make Neo Arcadia the only habitable location on Earth, which would force people to stay under his tyrannical rule. Zero eventually makes his way towards Ragnarok and defeats Weil, but not before Weil programs Ragnarok to crash into Area Zero in an attempt to cause immense destruction on Earth.

Knowing that there was only one option to save the Earth, Zero rejects Ciel&#x27;s plea to transfer out of Ragnarok and back to the Resistance Base and sacrifices his life to destroy Ragnarok&#x27;s core before it crashes to Earth. Ciel, watching the pieces of Ragnarok fall to Earth, promises to recreate the Earth as a better place where there will once again be peace between Reploids and humans. The series ends with an image of Zero&#x27;s shattered helmet on the ground along with Ragnarok&#x27;s debris.

== Content editing ==
In the Japanese versions of all four games, characters that were wounded would often spurt blood, or blood-like oil. Much of this was removed in international versions to maintain a child-friendly rating. These changes were not done to the Japanese versions of the games included within the &quot;Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot;.

The English version of the &quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; series has also edited some instances of words such as &quot;die&quot; or &quot;death,&quot; replacing them with terms such as &quot;perish,&quot; &quot;destroy,&quot; or &quot;retire&quot;.

== Reception ==
When the first game in the series came out, reviewers were quick to hail a return to what they considered &quot;the Mega Man roots&quot;; however, some fans criticized that the lack of knowing which boss the player will face next was a change for the worse and that it &quot;takes away what made the series unique in the past&quot;.

&quot;Mega Man Zero&quot; games have earned generally positive reviews. Review sources both criticized and praised the high difficulty level of the game and remarked that they were similar in nature to earlier installments in the Mega Man series. Positive reviews noted the variety of abilities and customization along with an engaging story than compared to its prequel series, while negative reviews focused on the series repetitiveness and lack of originality. Review scores were lower for the last two titles in the series, with critics pointing out that the games were just using the same gameplay without introducing anything new.

== Re-releases ==
Capcom bundled all four Mega Man Zero games in a single release for the Nintendo DS titled &quot;Mega Man Zero Collection&quot; (&quot;Rockman Zero Collection&quot; in Japan). The game was released in North America on June 8, 2010, two days later in Japan and Australia, and was slated for release in Europe on 11 June 2010, however, in the European region, release of the game has been inconsistent, with it not being released in some nations. No changes were made to the games in comparison with the original versions, but a few new features were added to the compilation, like an artwork gallery and the ability to remap certain actions to different buttons, as well as an &quot;Easy Scenario&quot; mode that allow the four games to be played as if they were a single one, with some alterations to make the games easier (e.g. blocks covering spikes, no need to feed Elves, all Cyber Elf powers automatically activated, etc.).

A new collection, known as &quot;Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection&quot; (&quot;Rockman Zero &amp; ZX Double Hero Collection&quot; in Japan), was released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC (Steam), and Nintendo Switch in February 2020. This contains all four &quot;Zero&quot; video games along with &quot;Mega Man ZX&quot; and &quot;Mega Man ZX Advent&quot;. Much like with &quot;Mega Man Zero Collection&quot;, and just like the previous &quot;Legacy Collection&quot; releases this one contains bonus content and a new gameplay mode known as Z Chaser, a time-trial based mini-game. It was originally set for release on January 21, 2020 (worldwide) and January 23, 2020 (in Japan), but was delayed until February 25, 2020 and February 27, 2020 respectively. Like with &quot;Mega Man X Legacy Collection&quot; and &quot;Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2&quot;, the game&#x27;s rating is T for Teen unlike the original releases which were rated E for Everyone, or E10+ in the case of &quot;Mega Man ZX Advent&quot; due to the inclusion of the uncensored Japanese versions.

== Manga ==
A manga series was authored by Hideto Kajima and serialised in &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; ran from June 2003 to February 2006. Unlike the games, the &quot;Rockman Zero&quot; manga is light-hearted and comical; during the series, three kids (one of them named Lito) went to an abandoned lab and released a reploid named Zero who saves them from a giant snake, Zero has two forms. His Hero form depicts him with his helmet on and has a serious personality. His normal form has his hair loose and is often depicted as weak with a skittish personality. His hero form activates whenever he is under stress. Whenever he switches back from hero to normal he does not retain his memories of him fighting and suffers from amnesia. Lito follows Zero through his journeys but often ends up being the one who saves the day, and has been compared to a Mary Sue.Other characters in the Zero games do appear in the manga but with some differences in personality, like Ciel whose personality was changed to be more hands-on and a bit ruthless, The Guardians, and Copy-X. There are some other characters that appear in the manga like Cial, Ciel&#x27;s evil sister who created Copy-X. 

Fifty years later the original Zero left for a mission, Lito (now an old man) uses all the information he learned about reploids and the original Zero, he creates another Zero. This Zero is fitted with the &quot;Hero of justice Circuits&quot; allowing him to access his weapons like his over-utilized Z-Knuckle, and be ready for action but with a downside of him acting like a child. His activation results in Zero accidentally blowing up Lito&#x27;s house. He soon comes across Omega, His design was changed, and his size is that of a regular reploid. He is looking for the Dark Elf (was not explained how it escaped) but Zero defeats Omega making him the new hero of the village. Zero soon befriends a cyber elf frog named Kwappa who was abandoned after some war (not known if it&#x27;s the elf wars) and becomes Zero&#x27;s sidekick. Omega tries multiple attempts to defeat Zero while also trying to find the Dark Elf but he fails and Dr. Weil fires him. Dr. Weil creates Roze, Roze try to replace zero but failed. Neige and Craft were introduced in the treasure hunting story. 

In one story Zero goes crazy and starts destroying stuff, Neige thinks he is possessed by the Dark Elf. Craft comes in and tries to help but gets defeated after getting hit by Zero&#x27;s Z-Knuckle, Zero steals Neige&#x27;s car and commits vehicular manslaughter on Omega trying to steal the Dark Elf from him. In the end, Zero turns back to normal, Lito and Neige realized that Zero wasn&#x27;t possessed but drank cola and got drunk.

<text>The House of Montefeltro is a historical Italian family who ruled Urbino and Gubbio and became Dukes of Urbino in 1443. The family extinguished in the male line in 1508 and the duchy was inherited by the Della Rovere family.

== History ==


The family was a branch of the Lords of Carpegna, just like its longtime opponents, the House of Malatesta, the signori of Rimini. Around 1140, Antonio (d. 1184?), by distribution among heirs with his brothers, received the castle of Montecopiolo and later acquired the castle of San Leo (situated on the rock &quot;mons feretrius&quot; that gave its name to the region of Montefeltro).

Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, made Antonio imperial vicar for the town of Urbino in 1155, thus claiming it to be a fief of the Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire) although the Papal States had an older claim to it. Antonio&#x27;s son, Montefeltrano I (c. 1135-1202), also vicar of Urbino, became count of Montefeltro. In 1226, the latter&#x27;s sons Buonconte I and Taddeo da Montefeltro were appointed Counts of Urbino by emperor Frederick II. During the struggles between papal and imperial followers (Guelphs and Ghibellines), the Montefeltro brothers and their descendants became leaders of the Ghibellines of the Marche and the Romagna while the Malatesta family took the lead of the Guelphs.

Buonconte I was succeeded by Montefeltrano II (1214–1255), and Guido I (1255–1286 and 1293–1296), who was captain of Forlì during wars with the French and papal armies. Pope Boniface VIII absolved him from censures for his actions in those wars, and employed him against Palestrina and the Colonna.

Guido&#x27;s successor, Federico I (1296–1322), increased his domains by taking Fano, Osimo, Recanati, Gubbio, Spoleto and Assisi from the Holy See. He was murdered after levying high taxes and Urbino fell under papal control. In 1323, however, Federico&#x27;s son Nolfo (1323–1359) was proclaimed lord of Urbino. In 1355, as a papal legate, Cardinal Albornoz travelled through Italy restoring papal authority and Urbino once more came under the control of the Holy See. Nolfo&#x27;s son, Federico II, was left without any authority, but his son, Antonio II (1377–1403), took advantage of the rebellion of the Marche and Umbria against the Holy See (1375) to restore his authority in Urbino.

Guidantonio (1403–1443) was appointed ruler of the Duchy of Spoleto by Pope Martin V (1419) and carried on war against Braccio da Montone with varying fortune. His son, Oddo Antonio, was assassinated after only a few months in power. The Urbinese then offered the lordship to Federico III (1444–1482), the illegitimate son of Guidantonio, a pupil of Vittorino da Feltre&#x27;s school and a lover of art. Under him Urbino became a cultural center of the Renaissance. He was implicated in the wars against Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, René of Anjou, and Florence. Pope Sixtus IV conferred on him the title of Duke of Urbino (1474).

Guidobaldo I (1492–1508) was forced to flee Urbino to escape the armies of Cesare Borgia. He adopted Francesco Maria della Rovere (1508–38), his sister&#x27;s child, thus uniting the signoria of Sinigaglia with Urbino. He aided Julius II in reconquering the Romagna. Pope Leo X deprived him of his territory, which was given to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, and later to Francesco Maria della Rovere. The Rovere family ruled the duchy until its extinction in 1631, when it returned to the Papal States.

<text>Lingfield is a village and civil parish in the Tandridge district of Surrey, England, approximately south of London. Several buildings date from the Tudor period and the timber-frame medieval church is Grade I listed. The stone cage or old gaol, constructed in 1773, was last used in 1882 to hold a poacher.

Lingfield Park Racecourse is to the south of the village. In addition to turf racing over jumps, there is also an all-weather course for flat racing

==History==
The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Tandridge hundred.

Lingfield was not listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, but is shown on the map as &quot;Leangafeld&quot;, its spelling in 871AD.

The southern part of the parish is in the old iron district. A forge and a furnace &#x27;about Copthorne and Lingfield&#x27; were owned by Lady Gage in 1574, and Clarke&#x27;s pond and Cook&#x27;s pond may have been heads for water power to work hammers. Henry Malden wrote in 1911 that Lingfield is mostly: 

On the creation of Surrey County Council in the late 19th century, the civil parish&#x27;s responsibilities became somewhat lessened but its area was approximately the same as in the medieval period, and it was this size which led to the decision to make Lingfield a post town across an even larger area.

With the backing of the Women&#x27;s Farm and Garden Union, Louisa Wilkins and Katherine Courtauld established a cooperative set of small holdings in 1920 on Wire Mill Lane in Lingfield. Surrey County Council created small holdings for over 250 servicemen in Surrey. It was the small holdings at Lingfield that provided small holdings for women. The initial funders included Margaret Ashton and Sydney Renee Courtauld and the experiment lasted until the 1930s.

==Landmarks==
The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul was rebuilt in 1431, although the original 14th-century tower remains. Its collection of brasses and monuments are amongst the finest in England, including the impressive tomb of Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham. There had been a church on the site for some centuries before the 14th-century building. Listed at Grade I, the highest category of architectural listing, the church is among a low percentage to have this status in the country.

The area around the church has been designated a conservation area as it has many early preserved buildings from the 16th to 18th centuries. In the main street, there is a cross and village cage. Unusually highly listed buildings merit mention below.

===Cage, St Peter&#x27;s Cross, Old Town Hall and Cottage===

The cage, last used in 1882 to hold a poacher, was built in 1773.

Old Town Hall and Old Town Cottage form one Grade II* listed building

The journal Le Globe Trotter from 26 February 1903, page 130, describes this place and provides a drawing of it, writing that this is the smallest church in the world, and not a prison place.

===The Library, Secular Cottage, Magnus Deo, Old House and The Garth===
The library is housed in the Old Guest House of the College for Secular Chaplains built in 1431 which adjoins and is at Grade II*. This hall-house is all that remains of the original College. Architecturally this building has Grade II* status, so too does the nearby building &quot;Magnus Deo&quot;. Unusually for an English village, two other buildings are at Grade II* within the village centre, The Old House (pre-Tudor period) and The Garth (1729).

===Pollard Cottage and Pollard House===
One secular building in Lingfield has the architectural accolade of Grade I listing: Pollard Cottage/Pollard House, a pre Tudor period hall house which is timber-framed and part whitewashed. To the right is Kentish bracing; to the centre flying braces across the centre first floor and forming the lower part of the roof coved eaves. Dragon posts and dragon beams, alongside irregular leaded windows add to the well-surviving display of medieval architecture.

===Church House and Star Inn Cottages===
This narrow terrace of Grade II* listed cottages is at the end of the narrow central street leading to the church though excluding the end-of-terrace Church Gate Cottage which is lower listed, dates to the Tudor period with a Georgian front including a deep wooden modillion eaves cornice, formerly in part an Inn.

===Remains of Starborough Castle and Moat===
In what was the parish until 2000 but is Dormansland civil parish east is the site of Starborough Castle, fortified by Lord Cobham (a medieval peerage) in 1341. Little now remains except parts of its walls, Grade II* listed and the moat, which is stone revetted, waterfilled and in good condition.

Lingfield is also home to one of the world&#x27;s oldest cricket clubs, with the first recorded match being against London on 18 June 1739.

==Geography==
&lt;br&gt;
Lingfield&#x27;s location in Tandridge District is shown above. The Prime Meridian passes close to the eastern border of Lingfield.

London is (centred) north-by-northwest and Oxted, the administrative centre of Tandridge is north. Guildford, Surrey&#x27;s county town is west-by-northwest.

Elevations range between 76m AOD in Lingfield Park Golf Course adjoining Lingfield Park and Felcourt to 46.5m AOD along the northern border, the Eden Brook from Moat Farm to the railway line.

==Notable venues==
===Social and activity clubs===
Among these are:
*Lingfield and Dormansland Rifle Club for competition shooters
*Lingfield Silver Band – a traditional Silver band.

===Charities===
Lingfield hosts the national charity Young Epilepsy (formerly named NCYPE/St. Piers/Lingfield Hospital School/Lingfield Epileptic Colony), which provides residential care and education for students with epilepsy and learning difficulties.

Nearby to the west of the A22 at Newchapel is the London England Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known as the Mormon Temple.

==Culture and Community==
Lingfield Civil Parish run annual events, meetings and village hall facilities offered by the third-tier local council.

==Localities==

===Felcourt===
Felcourt&#x27;s large Manor House and parkland was the head office of Rentokil Initial from 1949 until 2006; converted to apartments and a small business park.

===Felcourt Farm and Business Park===
Felcourt Farm is a large dairy farm, having in its area a small business park with 15 units, rented to businesses or available for rent.

==Sport and leisure==
Lingfield has a Non-League football club, Lingfield F.C., who play at The Sports Pavilion.

Lingfield has another thriving sport with cricket clubs also playing in the village.

A short lived greyhound racing track was opened from October 1991 until 1992 at the Nestledown Kennels off the Eastbourne Road. It had served as a schooling track previously but the racing took place on Saturdays at 1.00pm. The track had a large circumference of 475 metres with race distances of 300, 475 and 700 yards and two hares available, an Inside Sumner and an Outside McKee. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Trains run most notably from Lingfield railway station to London Victoria station and London Bridge station.

Refurbishment, finished in Spring 2013, of the Bluebell Railway made that steam tourist service accessible directly by car or modern train. East Grinstead railway station is a modern terminus of this formerly through-line to Lewes and beyond: the town of East Grinstead is just two stations south.

===Bus===
Bus services cover destinations such as Caterham, Oxted, Redhill, Crawley, Edenbridge, Dormansland and East Grinstead and are Southdown, Cruisers and Metrobus operations.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<text>Harry Kellar (born Heinrich Keller; July 11, 1849 – March 10, 1922) was an American magician who presented large stage shows during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Kellar was a predecessor of Harry Houdini and a successor of Robert Heller and Isaiah Hughes, under whom he apprenticed. He was often referred to as the &quot;Dean of American Magicians&quot; and performed extensively on five continents. One of his most memorable stage illusions was the levitation of a girl advertised as the &quot;Levitation of Princess Karnac&quot;, copied from an illusion invented by John Nevil Maskelyne, which was later bought by Harry Blackstone Sr.

He was a longtime customer of the Martinka Magic Company, which built many of his illusions and sets, including the &quot;Blue Room&quot;.

== Early life ==
As is the case with most magicians, there is little of Kellar&#x27;s early life that can be confirmed. His real name was Heinrich Keller and he was born to German immigrants in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was sometimes called Henry, but later changed it to Harry. He also changed the spelling of his last name from Keller to Kellar, to avoid confusion with Robert Heller. As a child, Kellar loved to play dangerous games and was known to play chicken with passing trains.

Kellar apprenticed under a druggist and frequently experimented with various chemical mixtures. On one occasion, Kellar reportedly blew a hole in the floor of his employer&#x27;s drugstore. Rather than confront the wrath of his parents, Kellar stowed away on a train and became a vagabond. He was only ten years old at the time.

Kellar was befriended by a British-born minister of religion from upstate New York. He offered to adopt Kellar and pay for his education if he would study to also become a minister. One evening Kellar saw the performance of a traveling magician, &quot;The Fakir of Ava&quot;, the stage name of Isaiah Harris Hughes, and, after the show, Kellar &quot;immediately got the urge to go on the stage&quot;. He later told Houdini that, &quot;I became very restless, bought books on magic and finally left my friend and benefactor&quot;.

While working on a farm in Buffalo, New York, Kellar answered an ad in the newspaper that was placed by Hughes, who was looking for an assistant. Kellar was hired at the age of 12, and at the age of 16, he gave his first solo performance in Dunkirk, Michigan; it was a disaster and Kellar went back to work with Hughes. Two years later, Kellar tried again with better results, but, as he was in poor financial condition, his early career often consisted of borrowing equipment for the show and avoiding creditors.

== Career ==
In 1869, Kellar began working with &quot;The Davenport Brothers and Fay&quot;, which was a group of stage spiritualists made up of Ira Erastus Davenport, William Henry Davenport and William Fay. With the Davenports and Fay, Kellar learned a lot about how to conduct a successful show. Kellar spent several years working with them, until 1873, when he and Fay parted ways with the Davenports and embarked on a &quot;world tour&quot; through Central and South America.

In Mexico, they were able to make $10,000 . In 1875, the tour ended in Rio de Janeiro with an appearance before Emperor Dom Pedro II.

Then, on their way to a tour in England, , the ship Kellar and Fay were sailing on, sank in the Bay of Biscay. Lost in the wreckage were Kellar&#x27;s equipment and clothing, along with the ship&#x27;s cargo of gold, silver. and uncut diamonds. After the shipwreck, Kellar was left with only the clothes on his back and a diamond ring he was wearing. Afterwards, his bankers in New York cabled him telling him that his bank had failed. Desperate for money, Kellar sold his ring and parted ways with Fay, who left to rejoin the Davenports. Kellar was able to perform in Dutch, French, and English, and subsequently toured across the world.

After visiting John Nevil Maskelyne&#x27;s and George Alfred Cooke&#x27;s theater, called the Egyptian Hall, Kellar was inspired and liked the idea of performing in one spot. He loved the illusions Maskelyne and Cook performed but it was Buatier de Kolta, then playing there, who performed &#x27;The Vanishing Birdcage&#x27;, a trick that Kellar decided he must have and spent his remaining money to buy it from him. Kellar borrowed $500 from Junius Spencer Morgan (father of J.P. Morgan), and returned to the United States to try to retrieve his funds from a bank transaction he had initiated when he was in Brazil. Knowing that mail from Brazil was slow, he was able to recover all of the $3,500. With the money, Kellar started a &quot;troupe&quot; based on Masekylne&#x27;s and Cooke&#x27;s in England, even going so far as naming his theater the Egyptian Hall.

In 1878, Kellar returned to England and invested $12,000 into purchasing new equipment, including a version Maskelyne&#x27;s whist-playing automaton &quot;Psycho&quot;.

After a disappointing tour in South America, Kellar cancelled his remaining shows and returned to New York. Shortly before arriving, Kellar was told of the death of magician Robert Heller. &quot;The New York Sun&quot; accused Kellar of violating Heller&#x27;s personality rights, saying that &quot;Heller is scarcely dead before we read of &#x27;Kellar the Wizard&#x27;.&quot; The article goes on to say, &quot;Of course &#x27;Kellar&#x27; aims to profit by the reputation that Heller left, by adopting a close imitation of Heller&#x27;s name. This is not an uncommon practice.&quot; Kellar attempted to prove that his name had always been Keller with an &quot;e&quot; and that he had actually changed it years previously to try to avoid being confused with Heller. He also pointed out that Heller had changed his name from William Henry Palmer. The public was still unreceptive to him, causing Kellar to eventually cancel his upcoming shows in the United States and return to Brazil.

After another world tour in 1882, Kellar was performing again in Melbourne and met a fan, Eva Lydia Medley, who came backstage to get his autograph. Kellar promised to send postcards and letters from his travels. They exchanged letters for the next five years.

Kellar started his version of Egyptian Hall in December 1884, after renting out an old Masonic temple on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After 264 performances, Kellar closed the theater on June 24, 1885. Shortly after Kellar left, the theater burned down.

While Kellar was performing in America, Medley arrived a few weeks before his appearance in Erie, Pennsylvania. She played the cornet in the show and started to learn about the magic business. Kellar and Medley were married on November 1, 1887, at a church in Kalamazoo, Michigan. She played an important role in Kellar&#x27;s shows in the coming years – not only did she play a part in many of his upcoming illusions, but she also provided music for the shows.

Kellar returned to Philadelphia in October 1891 and opened his second Egyptian Hall at Concert Hall, located also on Chestnut Street. On April 30, 1892, Kellar ended a successful seven-month run at his second Egyptian Hall. Kellar then returned to the road.

During the periods Kellar was abroad, another magician, Alexander Herrmann, had become famous and Kellar found himself with a rival on his return to the United States. Herrmann often criticized Kellar&#x27;s lack of sleight of hand and claimed he preferred to use mechanical tricks instead. While he lacked sleight of hand, Kellar was so good in using misdirection, that he said a &quot;...brass band playing at full blast can march openly across the stage behind me, followed by a herd of elephants, yet no one will realize that they went by.&quot; Herrmann died on December 17, 1896.

== Later life ==
Kellar retired in 1908, and allowed Howard Thurston to be his successor. Kellar had met Thurston, who was doing card tricks, while on vacation in Paris, France. Kellar did his final show at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland. Kellar eventually moved to his house in Los Angeles, California. Kellar&#x27;s wife died two years later.

Kellar was often visited by other magicians, notably including Harry Houdini. On November 11, 1917, Houdini put together a show for the Society of American Magicians to benefit the families of those who died in the sinking of the USS &quot;Antilles&quot; by a German U-boat (who have been considered the first American casualties of World War I). Houdini got Kellar to come out of retirement to perform one more show.

The show took place on the largest stage at the time, the Hippodrome. After Kellar&#x27;s performance, Kellar started to leave, but Houdini stopped him, saying that &quot;America&#x27;s greatest magician should be carried off in triumph after his final public performance.&quot; The members of the Society of American Magicians helped Kellar into the seat of a sedan chair, and lifted it up. The 125-piece Hippodrome orchestra played &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; while Kellar was slowly taken away.

Kellar lived in retirement, until he died on March 3, 1922, from a pulmonary hemorrhage brought on by influenza. He was interred in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles.
== Notable illusions ==

=== &quot;The Levitation of Princess Karnac&quot; ===
Kellar supposedly developed this trick by abruptly walking onto the stage during a show by Maskelyne, seeing what he needed to know, and leaving. Unable to duplicate it, Kellar hired another magician to help build another, but eventually designed a new trick with the help of the Otis Elevator Company. Another version built by Kellar was purchased by Harry Blackstone, Sr., who used the trick for many years. The Buffalo writer John Northern Hilliard wrote that the levitation was a marvel of the twentieth century and &quot;the crowning achievement of Mr. Kellar&#x27;s long and brilliant career.&quot;

The trick was done by a disguised machine hidden from the audience&#x27;s perspective. Kellar would claim the woman onstage, sleeping on a couch, was a Hindu princess, who he would levitate and then move a hoop back and forth through the woman&#x27;s body to prove she was not being suspended. Inside the &quot;princess&quot;&#x27;s dress was a flat board she was resting on, which was connected to a metal bar going out the side into the backstage. The other end of the bar connected to a machine to raise and lower the woman, blocked from view by the curtain and her own body. To allow Kellar to &quot;prove&quot; with the hoop that she was floating, the bar was in a rough &quot;S&quot; shape, letting him move the hoop through the length of her body in any direction.

=== &quot;The Nested Boxes&quot; ===
Kellar borrows six finger rings from members of audience. He loads them into the barrel of a pistol, aims and fires the pistol at a chest that is hanging on the side of the stage. The chest is opened and inside is another, smaller chest. Inside that are six boxes nested in each other. As each is opened, they are stacked on top of each other and inside the smallest one are the five rings each tied with ribbon to flowers. The five rings are returned to their owners. The owner of the sixth ring wonders what happened to hers, with Kellar pretending not to notice.

He continues with his next trick, which is a variation of Robert-Houdin&#x27;s &quot;Inexhaustible Bottle&quot;. Audience members call out different beverages like wine, whiskey, lemonade, or just water. Each one is poured from the same bottle and the audience acknowledges that they are indeed receiving their requested drinks. Once the bottle is empty, Kellar takes it and breaks it open. Inside is a guinea pig with a sash around its neck which has the sixth ring attached to it. The ring is eventually handed back to its owner.

A variation of the trick was performed in front of United States President Theodore Roosevelt and his children, Ethel, Archie, Quentin and Kermit. Ethel was the owner of the sixth ring and after Kellar had returned her ring, he asked if she would also like to have the guinea pig as a pet. Then Kellar wrapped the guinea pig in paper and handed it back to Ethel. When it was opened, inside was a bouquet of pink roses.

=== &quot;The Vanishing Lamp&quot; ===
A lamp is seen set on top of a glass table. Kellar covers the glowing lamp with a thin cloth. Kellar told the audience that each evening, the lamp would be returned to its purported, original owner in India at a specific time. As a bell sounded out the current time of day, Kellar loaded a pistol and aimed it towards the lamp. At the last chime, Kellar fired the pistol. The lamp seemed to melt away, with the cloth falling to the stage.

Kellar was known to have a short temper, and once, after an incident in which the &quot;Vanishing Lamp&quot; failed to vanish, he took an axe to the defective prop. Later Kellar built another one that would continue to work reliably long after his retirement.

<doc id="692524" wikidata="Q6798568" url="?curid=692524" title="Mazzikin">
<text>In Jewish mythology, mazzikin (, borrowed as ) are invisible demons that can create minor annoyances or greater dangers. This Aramaic term, which is found in the Talmud, means &quot;damagers&quot; or &quot;those who harm&quot;. It is generally understood to mean harmful invisible demons that a person could encounter in daily life. 
While Judaism today does not often directly discuss evil spirits, as late as the Geonic period, incantation bowls made by Aramaic-speaking inhabitants of Mesopotamia and the Levant (including both practicing Jews and rabbis) were a method of protecting individuals from a large array of demons and similar spirits, such as disease spirits, mazzikin, lilin, and shedim.

== Description ==

The Talmud, a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, contains various descriptions of mazikin throughout its pages. While these descriptions may not present a uniform or consistent portrayal, they provide insights into the understanding and beliefs about mazzikin in Jewish tradition during the time of the Talmud&#x27;s composition.

The Talmud describes mazzikin as having certain characteristics similar to both angels and humans (Hagigah 16a). According to the text, mazzikin have wings like angels, can traverse great distances quickly like angels, and possess knowledge of future events like angels. However, they also share traits with humans, such as eating, drinking, procreating, and dying.
Mazikin are believed to be numerous and constantly present around humans. Abaye, a prominent Amoraic sage, states that demons are more numerous than humans and surround them like a ridge around a field. Rav Huna, another Amora, further explains that every person has thousands of demons on each side, one thousand to the left and ten thousand to the right (Berakhot 6a).

Certain Talmudic passages describe methods of detecting mazzikin, such as sifting fine ashes around one&#x27;s bed to see their footprints, which resemble the feet of a rooster (Berakhot 6a). Another method involves using a black cat, specifically a firstborn black female cat, the daughter of a firstborn black female cat. By burning its hair and grinding the ashes, then placing the ashes in one&#x27;s eyes, a person could supposedly see the mazzikin (Berakhot 6a). Other passages suggest that mazzikin can be found in specific locations, such as under gutters (Pesachim 112a) or in ruins (Berakhot 3a).

The Talmud also describes practices to protect oneself from mazzikin, such as reciting the Shema Yisrael before going to sleep (Berakhot 5a).

<text>Chatfield Hollow State Park is a public recreation area occupying that lie adjacent to Cockaponset State Forest in the town of Killingworth, Connecticut. The state park offers hiking trails, a swimming beach, trout fishing, mountain biking, rock climbing, and picnicking areas. Park attractions include Schreeder Pond, Indian caves, historic sites, a restored water wheel, and a reproduction covered bridge. The park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

==History==
Chatfield Hollow was designated as a state park in 1949. It was developed in the 1930s as a Civilian Conservation Corps recreation area within Cockaponset State Forest. The CCC created Schreeder Pond in 1934 by building a horseshoe-shaped earth and stone dam across Chatfield Hollow Brook. In 1937, Oak Lodge was raised on the west side of Schreeder Pond; the lodge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. A &quot;from the ground up&quot; restoration of the lodge was completed in 2017. 

The region where the park now resides was an important area for indigenous peoples. From the Paleo-Indian time approximately 10,00 years B.C. until the Final Woodland years which end in 1633, the area that Chatfield Hollow State Park occupies was important for fishing, plant gathering, and hunting to the River Indians of New England.[6] The Hammonasset people are recorded as being the first known inhabitants of this area. There are large granite rock overhangs where artifact discovery shows inhabitance long before the first English colonists settled in Chatfield Hollow. These rock overhangs are today known as the Indian Caves and can be visited by hiking a marked trail in the park. The three Chatfield brothers for whom the park is named arrived from England around the year 1639.[7]

==Geology==
The park&#x27;s bedrock ledges consist of a type of gneiss called Monson Gneiss, a medium- to coarse-grained rock, light in color, mainly composed of plagioclase, quartz and biotite; trace amounts of garnet, epidote, magnetite can be observed in places. The park sits in a glacial valley, with steep declines on either side and an abundance glacial erratics. The erratics are smooth with sharp edges removed; the majority are composed of Monson Gneiss. Examples of other rock types can be found in the park, since erratics can sometimes be moved great distances.

==Activities and amenities==
;Hiking
The Paul F. Wildermann Boardwalk allows visitors to cross an inland swamp without disturbing it. In addition, some of hiking trails, including the blue-blazed Chatfield Trail, originate within the park and extend into adjacent sections of forest.

;Mountain biking
The park offers some of the most difficult technical cross-country mountain biking trails in the state. Among them are the Lookout Trail and the Pond Trail, which is a side trail that loops off the Deep Woods Trail.

;Rock climbing
The park&#x27;s ledges and cliffs include one of the most popular rock climbing routes in the state along the southern end of the Deep Woods Trail adjacent to Route 81.

;Trout fishing
Chatfield Hollow State Park is one of Connecticut&#x27;s 13 Trout Parks, with pond and stream stockings throughout the season and easy accessibility for young and novice anglers.

;Other
The park offers swimming on Schreeder Pond and areas for picnicking.

<text>Josef Leopold Auenbrugger or Avenbrugger (19 November 1722 – 17 May 1809), also known as Leopold von Auenbrugger, was an Austrian physician who invented percussion as a diagnostic technique. On the strength of this discovery, he is considered one of the founders of modern medicine.

==Biography==
Auenbrugger was a native of Graz in Styria, an Austrian province. His father, owner of the inn &quot;Zum Schwarzen Mohren&quot;, gave his son every opportunity for an excellent preliminary education in his native town and then sent him to Vienna to complete his studies at the university. Auenbrugger was graduated as a physician at the age of 22 and then entered the Spanish Military Hospital of Vienna, where he spent 10 years.

He found out that, by applying his ear to the patient and tapping lightly on the chest, one could assess the density of underlying tissues and organs. This technique of percussive diagnosis had its origins in testing the level of wine casks in the cellar of his father&#x27;s hotel. With this method, he was able to plot outlines of the heart. 
It was the first time that a physician could relatively accurately and objectively determine an important sign of diseases. He published his findings in a booklet, but nobody paid much attention to it.

During his ten years of patient study, Auenbrugger confirmed his observations on the diagnostic value of percussion by comparison with post-mortem specimens, and besides made a number of experimental researches on dead bodies. He injected fluid into the pleural cavity, and showed that it was perfectly possible by percussion to tell exactly the limits of the fluid present, and thus to decide when and where efforts should be made for its removal.

His name is also associated with Auenbrugger&#x27;s sign, a bulging of the epigastric region, in cases of large effusions of the pericardium, the membrane which envelops the heart.

His later studies were devoted to tuberculosis. He pointed out how to detect cavities of the lungs, and how their location and size might be determined by percussion. He also recognized that information with regard to the contents of cavities in the lungs and conditions of lung tissue might be obtained by placing the hand on the chest and noting the vibration, or &quot;fremitus&quot;, produced by the voice and breath. These observations were published in a little book called &quot;Inventum Novum ex Percussione Thoracis Humani Interni Pectoris Morbos Detegendi&quot;, the full English title being &quot;A New Discovery that Enables the Physician from the Percussion of the Human Thorax to Detect the Diseases Hidden Within the Chest&quot;. It is considered a book that marks an epoch in the modern history of medicine.

Like most medical discoveries, Auenbrugger&#x27;s method of diagnosis at first met with indifference. Before his death, however, it had aroused the attention of French physician René Laennec, who, following up the ideas suggested by it, discovered auscultation. 
The value of percussion in physical examination was later recognized by Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, who popularized it teaching it to his students in France, and by Joseph Škoda in Vienna. He also translated and illustrated Auenbrugger&#x27;s book in 1808, which helped to make Auenbrugger&#x27;s work on percussion better known.

Auenbrugger lived to the age of 86. He was especially noted for his cordial relations with the younger members of his profession and for his kindness to the poor and to those suffering from tuberculosis. He is sometimes said to have died in the typhus epidemic of 1798, but he actually died over a decade later.

Auenbrugger&#x27;s daughters, Marianna and Katerina, were composers and Marianna was a pupil of Antonio Salieri.

<doc id="692567" wikidata="Q7374707" url="?curid=692567" title="Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain">
<text>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) existed from its founding as the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1841 until 2010. The word &quot;Royal&quot; was added to its name in 1988. It was the statutory regulatory and professional body for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in England, Scotland and Wales. In September 2010, the regulatory powers of the Society were transferred to the newly formed General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The RPSGB became the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) at that time and retained its professional leadership role; the &quot;Great Britain&quot; part of the name was dropped for day-to-day purposes.

== Statutory role ==
Before the establishment of the GPhC and the transfer of regulatory power, the primary objective of the RPSGB was to lead, regulate, develop and promote the pharmaceutical profession. All pharmacists in Great Britain had to be registered with the Society in order to practise, and the Society was unusual amongst healthcare regulators that it had its own inspectorate.

In latter years, in order to become a member of the Society an individual usually had to complete: 
# a MPharm or (if graduating before 2000) a BPharm or BSc (pharmacy) degree, 
# 52 weeks of pre-registration training and
# pass a registration examination. 

This gave them the right to use the post-nominal letters MRPharmS (Member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society) and to practise as pharmacist in Great Britain. Fellowships (FRPharmS) were also awarded for pharmacists with long standing and outstanding commitment to the profession.

Since 2010, the register of pharmacists is now held by the GPhC and it is this body which now controls registration and fitness to practise. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society now provides Members with the post-nominals &#x27;MRPharmS&#x27;, Associate members receive &#x27;ARPharmS&#x27;, pharmaceutical Scientist members awarded &#x27;SRPharmS&#x27;, and Fellows denoted by the &#x27;FRPharmS&#x27; post-nominals.

== History ==
The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded on 15 April 1841 by William Allen FRS, Jacob Bell, Daniel Hanbury, John Bell, Andrew Ure, James Marwood Hucklebridge, and other London chemists and druggists, at a meeting in the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Strand, London. William Allen was its first President, and the society quickly took premises at 17 Bloomsbury Square, London where a School of Pharmacy was established in which botany and materia medica were an important part of the students’ curriculum. In 1843, Queen Victoria granted the society its Royal Charter. 

In 1879 Rose Coombes Minshull (1845–1905) and Isabella Skinner Clarke (1842–1926) became the first two women elected as full members of the society. In 1918 Margaret Elizabeth Buchanan became the first woman to be elected to the Council of the society, serving until 1926. Jean Irvine became the first female president of the society in 1947, which position she held until 1948.

In 1981, the RPSGB Diploma course in Veterinary pharmacy was initiated by professionals such as Michael Jepson and Steven Kayne, the former of whom led what was to become an institution until he retired in 2004. Sarah Cockbill then took the responsibility.

In 1988, Queen Elizabeth II agreed that the title &quot;Royal&quot; should be granted to the society.

The RPSGB operated a publishing company and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Museum, both of which are now operated by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

<text>William Oliver Wallace (8 December 1929 – 8 March 2009), known by his stage name Ali Bongo, was a British comedy magician and former president of The Magic Circle, who performed an act in which he was known as the &quot;Shriek of Araby&quot;.

==Early life==
Bongo was born as William Oliver Wallace in Bangalore, British India, where his father (also called William) was serving as a sergeant major with the 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment. Young William spent his early years on a British station in Trimulgherry, Secunderabad, before going to Britain with his mother Lillian at the age of seven.

After William Wallace senior had ended his army service, the family moved to Sutton Valence in Kent and young William won a scholarship to Sutton Valence School, leaving at the age of 16 to begin his career as an entertainer. His time in National Service was spent with the Royal Army Pay Corps. He worked for Harry Stanley&#x27;s Unique Magic Studio and was manager of the magic department at Hamleys toy shop in London&#x27;s Regent Street.

==Career==
Wallace created his &#x27;Shriek of Araby&#x27; character with an oriental costume (robes, golden curly-toed slippers, horn-rimmed spectacles and headgear that incorporated both fez and turban) and took the name &quot;Ali Bongo&quot; from a character he had created for a youth club pantomime that he had co-written and appeared in while in his teens. The original character had sung a song which began: &quot;My name is Ali Bongo and I come from Pongo, pong-tiddley-pongo land.&quot; Among his later magic catchphrases were &quot;Uju Buju Suck Another Juju&quot;, &quot;Aldy Bority Phostico Formio&quot;, and &quot;Hocus Pocus Fishbones Chokus&quot;.

He made his British TV debut on &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; in 1965 on a bill topped by Tommy Trinder. Ali Bongo wrote many books on magic, many containing tricks of his own. He also illustrated them in his instantly recognisable style. He acted as magic consultant for many plays, opera, ballets and TV shows including &quot;David Nixon&#x27;s Magic Box&quot; and &quot;The David Nixon Magic Show&quot; for Thames Television and &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot; for the BBC.

Ali Bongo was the presenter of &quot;Ali Bongo&#x27;s Cartoon Carnival&quot;, which featured himself and his assistant Oscar. It aired on UK TV BBC1 on Saturdays between 23 October and 18 December 1971, a total of nine episodes.

Bongo was featured in an episode of children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Rainbow&quot;, appeared in the science fiction show &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; in the serial &quot;Revenge of Jedikiah&quot;, and had a slot in &quot;Zokko!&quot;. He also acted as the magical advisor on the TV show &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the 1970s cult series &quot;Ace of Wands&quot;. In 1988 he made a brief appearance in the LWT newspaper-based comedy show &quot;Hot Metal&quot;. His well-known ability for devising tricks and illusions and solving magical problems inspired the TV writer David Renwick to create a character who was a magician&#x27;s assistant and amateur sleuth in the series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. Bongo was magical adviser to the series.

Bongo joined The Magic Circle in 1960, and two years later was made a Member of The Inner Magic Circle. He won The Magic Circle Magician of the Year in 1972, the Carlton Comedy Award in 1983, and the David Berglas Award in 1991. He served twice as vice-president of The Magic Circle before being elected president on 8 September 2008.

==Death==
At the beginning of February 2009, Bongo collapsed while giving a lecture in Paris. He was taken to hospital and, whilst there, suffered a stroke. He was subsequently returned to the United Kingdom and cared for in St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London, where he later died from complications arising from pneumonia on 8 March. Ali Bongo&#x27;s cremation and broken wand ceremony took place on 27 March 2009 at Randalls Park Crematorium, Leatherhead.

<text>Carleton Lewis Kealiinaniaimokuokalani Reichel (born June 26, 1962) popularly known as Kealii Reichel, is a popular and bestselling singer, songwriter, choreographer, dancer, chanter, scholar, teacher, and personality from Hawaii. He has spent his life educating the world about Hawaiian culture through music and dance. 

Kealii (pronounced Keh-ah-LEE-ee) Reichel was born and raised on the island of Maui. Reichel grew up in the town of Lahaina where he attended Lahainaluna High School, however he spent weekends and summers with his maternal grandmother in the plantation town of Pāia. At the age of 24, Reichel was convicted of theft, and was sentenced to community service, which involved a study of Hawaiian culture. This marked a turning point in his life, as he decided to devote the rest of his life to the study and promotion of Hawaiian culture.

Reichel was one of the founding directors for Punana Leo O Maui, a Hawaiian language immersion pre-school. He has taught Hawaiian culture and language at the University of Hawaii&#x27;s, Maui Community College, and he was the Cultural Resource Specialist and curator at the Bailey House Museum in Wailuku.

==Hawaiian mele (music)==
Reichel studied Hawaiian dance and vocals under Kumu [hula] (dance instructor/choreographer/master) Pekelo Day and Pualani Kanakaole Kanahele, daughter of the kumu hula and Hawaiian scholar &quot;Aunty&quot; Edith Kanakaʻole. He later founded his own hālau hula (Hawaiian dance school) Halau hula o ka Makani Wili Makaha o Kauaula now called Halau Kealaokamaile. He founded this hālau at the age of 18 after graduating from Lahainaluna High School

In 1994, at the age of 32, he recorded and released a collection of Hawaiian traditional and contemporary music entitled &quot;Kawaipunahele&quot; on his own Punahele Productions record label, and began his career as a Hawaiian music superstar. Reichel&#x27;s subsequent albums, &quot;Lei Halia&quot; (1995), E &quot;O Mai&quot; (1997), and &quot;Melelana&quot; (1999), placed him securely at the top of the Hawaiian music entertainment industry. He is also featured in two anthology albums released by his record label, &quot;Pride of Punahele&quot; (1998) and &quot;Pride of Punahele 2&quot; (2003).

In 2004, his album of the previous year, &quot;Ke&#x27;alaokamaile&quot; (2003), won four of the top awards at the 27th Annual [Na Hoku Hanohano Awards] (Hawaii&#x27;s regional equivalent of the Grammy Awards) including Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year, Hawaiian Album of the Year and Song of the Year.

Reichel also won big at the 38th annual Na Hoku Hanohano Awards in 2015, with his album of the previous year, &quot;Kawaiokalena&quot;. He won five of the top awards: Male Vocalist of the Year, Album of the Year, Hawaiian Album of the Year and Entertainer of the Year and Hawaiian Language Songwriting and Performance. This release was also nominated for a Grammy the same year.

Reichel&#x27;s style most often includes vocals over a guitar, bass, and ukulele ensemble but may also include a Western (European-American) string quartet violin, viola and cello or traditional pre-1778 Hawaiian instruments. His vocals include Hawaiian language chanting and singing in both Hawaiian and English. Stage performances include dance in both traditional and modern hula forms. He also plays the guitar.

==In theater==
Reichel performed in the Maui Youth Theater production of Jesus Christ Superstar as Judas Iscariot and in the Maui Academy of Performing Arts production of Jesus Christ Superstar as Jesus.

==International recognition==
Reichel currently has contracts with JVC Victor Entertainment and Atlantic/Time-Warner. Kealii Reichel&#x27;s consistent placement in Billboard Magazine&#x27;s World Music Charts has garnered him international attention. He has opened concerts for Bonnie Raitt, LeAnn Rimes, Céline Dion, and Sting. In addition to his regular concerts in Hawaii, he has toured the United States mainland playing in such places as New York at Carnegie Hall and Town Hall, San Diego, San Francisco, Anaheim, Hollywood Bowl, Phoenix, Portland, Seattle and toured internationally with concerts and workshops in the South Pacific, Europe and Asia where he performs to sold out audiences.

Reichel is known not only for his artistry as a performer, songwriter and recording artist, but also for his work as an ambassador of Hawaiian culture to the rest of the world.

== Personal life ==

Reichel is married to Krauss.

<doc id="692593" wikidata="Q3023512" url="?curid=692593" title="Deputy lieutenant">
<text>In the United Kingdom, a deputy lieutenant is a Crown appointment and one of several deputies to the lord-lieutenant of a lieutenancy area – an English ceremonial county, Welsh preserved county, Scottish lieutenancy area, or Northern Irish county borough or county. Before the creation of the Irish Free State, all Irish counties had deputy lieutenants.

In formal style, the postnominal letters DL may be added after a deputy lieutenant&#x27;s surname and other postnominals – &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;John Brown, CBE, DL&quot;. The position of Deputy Lieutenant is honorary and receives no remuneration.

==Overview==
Deputy lieutenants are nominated by a lord-lieutenant, to assist with any duties as may be required (see the Lieutenancies Act 1997). Deputy lieutenants receive their commission of appointment via the appropriate government minister by command of the British monarch. In England and Wales, since November 2001, the minister responsible for most appointments is the Lord Chancellor, with exceptions such as the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In Scotland, since July 1999, it has been the Scottish Ministers.

Decades ago, the number of deputy lieutenants for each county could be as few as three. Today, however, there may be well over a dozen that are appointed, as the number of deputy lieutenants today correlates with the population of each respective county. Deputy lieutenants tend to be people who either have served the local community, or have a history of public service in other fields.

Deputy lieutenants represent the lord-lieutenant in his or her absence, including at local ceremonies and official events, from opening exhibitions to inductions of vicars (as requested by the Church of England). They must live within their lieutenancy area, or within seven miles (11 km) of its boundary. Their appointments do not terminate with any change of lord-lieutenant, but they are legally required to retire at age 75.
One of the serving deputy lieutenants is appointed to be vice lord-lieutenant, who in most circumstances will stand in for a lord-lieutenant who cannot be present. The appointment as vice lord-lieutenant usually expires upon the retirement of the lord-lieutenant who made the choice. Generally, the vice lord-lieutenant would then revert to being a regular deputy lieutenant.

Unlike the office of lord-lieutenant, which is an appointment in the gift of the Sovereign, the position of deputy lieutenant is an appointment of the Sovereign&#x27;s appointee, and therefore not a direct appointment of the Sovereign &quot;&quot;.

Deputy lieutenant commissions are published by the clerk of the lieutenancy, as a State Appointment, in either the &quot;London Gazette&quot; or the &quot;Edinburgh Gazette&quot;, as appropriate, with the names of the persons appointed deputy lieutenants for that county or area, and the dates of their commissions.

<text>Fludrocortisone, sold under the brand name Florinef among others, is a corticosteroid used to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia, postural hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency. In adrenal insufficiency, it is generally taken together with hydrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is taken by mouth and is most commonly used in its acetate form.
Common side effects of fludrocortisone include high blood pressure, swelling, heart failure, and low blood potassium. Other serious side effects can include low immune-system function, cataracts, muscle weakness, and mood changes. Whether use of fludrocortisone during pregnancy is safe for the fetus is unknown. Fludrocortisone is mostly a mineralocorticoid, but it also has glucocorticoid effects.
Fludrocortisone was patented in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Fludrocortisone has been used in the treatment of cerebral salt-wasting syndrome. It is used primarily to replace the missing hormone aldosterone in various forms of adrenal insufficiency such as Addison&#x27;s disease and the classic salt-wasting (21-hydroxylase deficiency) form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Due to its effects on increasing Na+ levels, and therefore blood volume, fludrocortisone is the first-line of treatment for orthostatic intolerance, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It can be used to treat low blood pressure.

Fludrocortisone is also a confirmation test for diagnosing Conn&#x27;s syndrome (aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma), the fludrocortisone suppression test. Loading the patient with fludrocortisone would &quot;suppress&quot; serum aldosterone level in a normal patient, whereas the level would remain &quot;elevated&quot; in a Conn&#x27;s patient. The fludrocortisone suppression test is an alternative to the NaCl challenge (which would use normal saline or salt tablets).

==Side effects==
Use of fludrocortisone can lead to one or more of the following side effects:
* Sodium and water retention
* Swelling due to fluid retention (edema)
* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Headache
* Low blood potassium level (hypokalemia)
* Muscle weakness
* Fatigue
* Increased susceptibility to infection
* Impaired wound healing
* Increased sweating
* Increased hair growth (hirsutism)
* Thinning of skin and stretch marks
* Disturbances of the gut such as indigestion (dyspepsia), distention of the abdomen and ulceration (peptic ulcer)
* Decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures of the bones
* Insomnia
* Depression
* Weight gain
* Raised blood sugar level
* Changes to the menstrual cycle
* Cataracts
* Raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma)
* Increased pressure in the skull (intracranial pressure)

==Pharmacology==

Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid and acts as a powerful mineralocorticoid, along with some additional but comparatively very weak glucocorticoid activity. Relative to cortisol, it is said to have 10 times the glucocorticoid potency but 250 to 800 times the mineralocorticoid potency. Fludrocortisone acetate is a prodrug of fludrocortisone, which is the active form of the drug.

Plasma renin, sodium, and potassium are checked through blood tests to verify that the correct dosage is reached.

==Chemistry==
Fludrocortisone, also known as 9α-fluorocortisol (9α-fluorohydrocortisone) or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a halogenated derivative of cortisol (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). Specifically, it is a modification of cortisol with a fluorine atom substituted in place of one hydrogen atom at the C9α position. Fluorine is a good bioisostere for hydrogen because it is similar in size, with the major difference being in its electronegativity. The acetate form of fludrocortisone, fludrocortisone acetate, is the C21 acetate ester of fludrocortisone, and is hydrolyzed into fludrocortisone in the body.

==History==
Fludrocortisone was described in the literature in 1953 and was introduced for medical use (as the acetate ester) in 1954. It was the first synthetic corticosteroid to be marketed, and followed the introduction of cortisone in 1948 and hydrocortisone (cortisol) in 1951. Fludrocortisone was also the first fluorine-containing pharmaceutical drug to be marketed.

<text>The Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy is awarded annually by the American Astronomical Society (AAS) to a woman resident of North America, who is within five years of receipt of a PhD, for distinguished contributions to astronomy or for similar contributions in related sciences which have immediate application to astronomy. The awardee is invited to give a talk at an AAS meeting and is given a $1,500 honorarium. The award is named in honor of American astronomer Annie Jump Cannon.

Margaret Burbidge was due to be given the 1972 award, but she refused it on the grounds of gender discrimination, stating: &quot;It is high time that discrimination in favor of, as well as against, women in professional life be removed&quot;. This prompted the AAS to set up its first committee on the status of women in astronomy and they ceased issuing the award directly. From 1973 to 2004 the American Association of University Women issued the awards, on advice from the AAS. The AAS resumed direct issuing of the award in 2005.

<doc id="692606" wikidata="Q4821504" url="?curid=692606" title="Augustus Noble Hand">
<text>Augustus Noble Hand (July 26, 1869 – October 28, 1954) was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and later was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. His most notable rulings restricted the reach of obscenity statutes in the areas of literature and contraceptives. He was the older first cousin of famed judge Learned Hand, who served on both courts with his cousin during most of Augustus Hand&#x27;s tenure.

==Education and career==

Born in Elizabethtown, New York, Hand received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Harvard University in 1890, and earned a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1894. He then established a private practice in New York City, which he maintained until 1914.

==Federal judicial service==

Hand was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson on September 28, 1914, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge George Chandler Holt. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 30, 1914, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on June 1, 1927, due to his elevation to the Second Circuit.

Hand received a recess appointment from President Calvin Coolidge on May 19, 1927, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Charles Merrill Hough. He was nominated to the same position by President Coolidge on December 6, 1927. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 18, 1928, and received his commission the same day. He assumed senior status on June 30, 1953. His service terminated on October 28, 1954, due to his death in Middlebury, Vermont.

==Notable decisions==

===Contraceptives===

One of Hand&#x27;s best-known decisions was rendered in the case of &quot;United States v. One Package&quot;, 86 F.2d 737 (2d Cir. 1934), in which he ruled that contraceptives, when imported by a licensed physician, were not immoral or obscene devices banned under the Comstock Law provisions incorporated into the Tariff Act of 1930. Hand wrote that &quot;we are satisfied that this statute, as well as all the acts we have referred to, embraced only such articles as Congress would have denounced as immoral if it had understood all the conditions under which they were to be used. Its design, in our opinion, was not to prevent the importation, sale, or carriage by mail of things which might intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent physicians for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well being of their patients.&quot;

===Censorship===

The same year, Hand further limited the Tariff Act&#x27;s restrictions in &quot;United States v. One Book Called Ulysses&quot;, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934), which ruled that the novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, by James Joyce, was not obscene and therefore could not be banned from import into the United States. The opinion was significant in its urging that any test of obscenity could not rely on mere isolated passages but instead had to consider the work as a whole, a test the Supreme Court later endorsed. These principles, filtered through a long line of later cases, ultimately influenced the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s case law on obscenity standards. Hand&#x27;s opinion also displayed a historical perspective of the harm of overzealous censorship:Art certainly cannot advance under compulsion to traditional forms, and nothing in such a field is more stifling to progress than limitation of the right to experiment with a new technique. The foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about one hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mab&quot; was an indictable offense are a warning to all who have to determine the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves. We think that Ulysses is a book of originality and sincerity of treatment and that it has not the effect of promoting lust. Accordingly it does not fall within the statute, even though it justly may offend many. Hand&#x27;s cousin, Judge Learned Hand, joined in Augustus Hand&#x27;s opinion; Chief Judge Martin Manton dissented.

===Motion Picture Antitrust===

In 1946, Hand was temporarily assigned to a three-judge panel of the New York Southern District Court for the U.S. government&#x27;s antitrust case against the eight largest movie distributors. The court&#x27;s &quot;per curiam&quot; decree in &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures&quot;, 70 F.Supp. 53 (S.D.N.Y. 1946), significantly altered the motion picture industry in the United States, by forbidding the distributors from colluding with movie theaters in such anti-competitive licensing practices as price-fixing.

<text>The Sakhalin-I () project, a sister project to Sakhalin-II, is a consortium for production of oil and gas on Sakhalin Island and immediately offshore. It operates three fields in the Okhotsk Sea: Chayvo, Odoptu, and Arkutun-Dagi.

In 1996, the consortium completed a production-sharing agreement between the Sakhalin-I consortium, the Russian Federation and the Sakhalin government. The consortium was managed and operated by Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), a unit of ExxonMobil, until Exxon&#x27;s withdrawal in March 2022 following the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government froze Exxon&#x27;s investment in August 2022 and ordered its transfer to a newly created Russian company the following October.

Since 2003, when the first Sakhalin-1 well was drilled, six of the world&#x27;s 10 record-setting extended reach drilling wells have been drilled at the fields of the project, using the Yastreb rig. It has set multiple industry records for length, rate of penetration and directional drilling. 
On 27 August 2012, Exxon Neftegas beat its previous record by completing Z-44 Chayvo well. This ERD well reached a measured total length of , making it the longest well in the world. In November 2017, the record well reached long.

==History==
Sakhalin I&#x27;s fields Chayvo, Arkutun-Dagi and Odoptu were discovered by the Soviets some 20 years before the Production Sharing Agreement of 1996. However these fields had never been properly assessed and a reevaluation of the commercial viability had to be carried out. To do this, factors such as the reservoir quality, producibility and well locations had to be found. 3-D seismic is the most common way to determine much of this however shallow gas reservoirs interfered with the seismic signals and blurred the images somewhat.

Two campaigns of 3-D seismic were carried out along with a number of appraisal wells into the Arkutun-Dagi and Chayvo fields. The results were initially average from the appraisal wells with hydrocarbons being successfully tested, but there was still a large amount of uncertainty involved with the project. However, in late 1998, a revaluation of the 3-D seismic data using the most advanced seismic-visualization techniques then available indicated that the hydrocarbon depth on the edge of the field could be significantly deeper than first thought. In 2000, the Chayvo 6a delineation well confirmed what was suspected, a oil column. This provided the certainty that the field was commercially viable in the hostile environment with a potential to be a field.

In 2007, the project set a world record when extended-reach drilling (ERD) well Z-11 reached . That record was broken in early 2008 with extended-reach well Z-12 reaching . Both extended-reach wells are in the Chayvo field and reach over . , the Chayvo field contains 17 of the world&#x27;s 30 longest extended-reach-drilling wells. However, in May 2008, both world records of ERD well were surpassed by the &quot;GSF Rig 127&quot; operated by Transocean, which drilled the ERD well BD-04A in the Al Shaheen oil field in Qatar. This ERD well was drilled to a record measured length of including a record horizontal reach of in 36 days.

On 28 January 2011, Exxon Neftegas, operator of the Sakhalin-1 project, drilled the then world&#x27;s longest extended-reach well. It has surpassed both the Al Shaheen well and the previous decades-long leader Kola Superdeep Borehole as the world&#x27;s longest borehole. The Odoptu OP-11 Well reached a measured total length of and a horizontal displacement of . Exxon Neftegas completed the well in 60 days.

On 27 August 2012, Exxon Neftegas beat its own record by completing Z-44 Chayvo well. This ERD well reached a measured total length of .

Since the start of drilling in 2003 to 2017, Sakhalin-1 has drilled 9 of the 10 longest wells in the world. Since 2013, the project has set five records for drilling wells with the deepest depths in the world. In April 2015, the O-14 production well was drilled, with length of , in April 2014 the Z-40 well was completed with a length of , in April and June 2013 - the Z-43 and Z-42 wells and long, respectively. In November 2017 the record well reached long.

Production from Sakhalin 1 halted in May 2022, when operator Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February. In October 2022 Vladimir Putin instructed authorities to disband Exxon Neftegaz and transfer the project and all of its assets and equipment to a new operator, in which the government will hold a controlling 80% shareholding for an initial period of one month. The Exxon Neftegaz shareholding may be sold at an auction to a third party if authorities discover any damage to the development. By November the new operator of the project &quot;Sakhalin 1 LLC&quot; was owned 30% by Exxon Mobil, 20% by India’s Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC), 30% by Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO), Rosneft subsidiary &quot;Sakhalinmorneftegaz-Shelf&quot; who manages the project was given 11.5% and &quot;JSC RN-Astra&quot; 8.5%.

After handing over operations of Sakhalin 1 to the Rosneft subsidiary, production was re-established with an output of - expected to rise to eventually.

==Development==
The three fields will be developed in this order: Chayvo, Odoptu and Arkutun-Dagi. The total project is estimated to cost US$10–12 billion, making it the largest direct investment in Russia from foreign sources. It is also estimated that nearly 13,000 jobs will be created either directly or indirectly. Approximately $2.8 billion has already been spent, which helped lower unemployment and improved the tax base of the regional government. The fields are projected to yield of oil and of natural gas.

In 2007, the consortium reached its production goal of of oil. In addition, natural gas production for the peak winter season in 2007 was .

The first rig is in place for Sakhalin-I, Yastreb, is the most powerful land rig in the world. Parker Drilling Company is the operator of the high rig. Although the rig is land based it will drill more than 20 extended-reach wells horizontally out into the Sea of Okhotsk, and in depth. This land-based offshore drilling arrangement is needed because the Sea of Okhotsk is frozen about four months out of the year. The rig is designed to be resistant to the earthquakes that frequent the area, and operate in the temperatures that can occur in the winter.

As part of the project, Russia is in the process of building a pipeline across the Tatar Strait from Sakhalin Island to De-Kastri oil terminal on the Russian mainland. From De-Kastri it will be loaded onto tankers for transport to East Asian markets.

==Consortium==

Prior to March 2, 2022 the consortium consisted of:
* 30.0% - ExxonMobil (United States)
* 30.0% - Sakhalin Oil &amp; Gas Development Co (Japan)
* 20.0% - ONGC Videsh Ltd. (India)
* 11.5% - Sakhalinmorneftegas-Shelf (Russia)
* 8.5% - RN-Astra (Russia)

Both Russian entities are Rosneft affiliates.

Restructured with a new project company, Sakhalin 1 LLC in October 2023, Sakhalinmorneftegas-Shelf became the new manager of the project.

==Environment==
Scientists and environmental groups have voiced concern that the Sakhalin-I oil and gas project in the Russian Far East, operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary Exxon Neftegas, threatens the critically endangered western gray whale population. Approximately 130 western gray whales remain, of which only 30-35 are reproductive females. These whales only feed during the summer and autumn, in feeding grounds which happen to lie adjacent to Sakhalin-I project onshore and offshore facilities and associated activities along the northeast coast of Sakhalin Island. Particular concerns were caused by the decision to construct a pier and to start shipping in Piltun Lagoon.

Since 2006, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has convened the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel (WGWAP), consisting of marine scientists who provide expert analysis and advice concerning impacts on the endangered western gray whale population from oil and gas projects in the area, including Sakhalin-I.
In February 2009, the WGWAP reported that the number of western gray whales observed in the near-shore (primary) feeding area had significantly declined in the summer of 2008, which coincides with industrial activities conducted by ENL (and other companies) in the area. The WGWAP suggested a moratorium on all industrial activities in the area until their effects had been studied or plans made to mitigate any negative effects of industrial activity had been implemented. Cooperation of Sakhalin Energy-ENL with the scientific panel investigating gray whales was hampered by confidentiality agreements and by ENL&#x27;s lack of motivation to cooperate with the process.

ExxonMobil has responded that since 1997 the company has invested over $40 million to the western whale monitoring program.

In June 2018 the Sakhalin Environment Watch reported a huge die off of Pacific herring fish at the River Kadylaniy near Sakhalin&#x27;s pipeline outlet. Low oxygen concentrations, related to oil production work has been suggested as the culprit.

==ExxonMobil withdrawal==
On March 1, 2022, ExxonMobil, the principal operator of the Sakhalin I project, announced its complete withdrawal from the project. A company press release cited the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the desire to comply with international sanctions as reasons for the termination of operations, along with a desire to protect investors&#x27; assets. In the same document, ExxonMobil announced its intent to end any participation the company had or has planned in the country.

<text>The Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT; , , ) is a railway tunnel through the Alps in Switzerland. It opened in June 2016 and full service began the following December. With a route length of , it is the world&#x27;s longest railway and deepest traffic tunnel and the first flat, low-level route through the Alps. Located at the heart of the Gotthard axis, it is the third tunnel to connect the cantons of Uri and Ticino, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.

The GBT consists of a large complex with, at its core, two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld (Uri) with Bodio (Ticino) and passing below Sedrun (Grisons). 
It is part of the New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA) project, which also includes the Ceneri Base Tunnel further south (opened on 3 September 2020) and the Lötschberg Base Tunnel on the other main north–south axis. 
It is referred to as a &quot;base tunnel&quot; since it bypasses most of the existing vertex line, the Gotthard railway line, a winding mountain route opened in 1882 across the Saint-Gotthard Massif, which was operating at its capacity before the opening of the GBT. 
The new base tunnel establishes a direct route usable by high-speed rail and heavy freight trains.

The main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier, especially for freight on the Rotterdam–Basel–Genoa corridor. The tunnel is specifically meant to shift freight to trains from trucks, and thereby to reduce environmental damage and deadly road crashes. The tunnel also provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland, as well as between northern and southern Europe, cutting the Basel/Zürich–Lugano–Milan journey time for passenger trains by one hour (and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes).

After 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum, the first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996. Construction began in November 1999 at Amsteg. Drilling operations were completed in March 2011. Completed in 2016, the final cost was reported to be CHF 12.2 billion ( billion).

==Description==
The Gotthard Base Tunnel, with a length of and a total of of tunnels, shafts and passages, is the longest railway tunnel in the world, with a geodetic distance of between the two portals. It is also the first flat route through the Alps or any other major mountain range, with a maximum elevation of above sea level, corresponding to that of Bern. It is the deepest railway tunnel in the world, with a maximum depth of , comparable to that of the deepest mines on Earth. Without ventilation, the temperature inside the mountain reaches .

Like the two other tunnels passing below the Gotthard, the Gotthard Base Tunnel connects two Alpine valleys across the Saint-Gotthard Massif: the &quot;Urner Reusstal&quot; in the canton of Uri, in which flows the river Reuss, and the Valle Leventina, the largest valley in the canton of Ticino, in which the river Ticino flows. Unlike most other tunnels, the Gotthard Base Tunnel passes under several distinct mountain massifs, two of them being major subranges of the Alps, the Glarus Alps and the Saint-Gotthard Massif, with the valley of the Anterior Rhine, the Surselva in the canton of Graubünden, between them. The tunnel passes under these two ranges more than below the Chrüzlistock () and the Piz Vatgira (, near the Lukmanier Pass). While the cantons of Uri and Ticino are part of the German- and Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland respectively, the Surselva is mainly Romansh-speaking.

The Alps strongly influence the European climate – and that of Switzerland in particular – and there can be substantially different weather conditions at each end of the GBT, described by the Ticinese architect Mario Botta: &quot;The light changes at the Gotthard: that of the Mediterranean Sea is not the same as that of the continent, that of the central lands, that of Europe far away from the sea.&quot; On average, the temperature is about higher on the south side than the north side, but on some days, temperature differences are well over .

The north portal lies in the north of the municipality of Erstfeld at an elevation of , east of the Reuss. There, the tunnel penetrates the western slopes of the Bälmeten and Chli Windgällen (although only marginally) before passing below the valley of the Chärstelenbach, a creek in the Maderanertal. From there, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of Etzli, below the Witenalpstock. The main crest of the Glarus Alps, which is the watershed between the Reuss and the Anterior Rhine, is crossed below the Chrüzlistock, the crest having an elevation of about at this point. From the crest and border, the tunnel runs parallel to the small valley of the river Strem (Val Strem) before passing below Sedrun and the Anterior Rhine. From the bottom of the valley, the tunnel proceeds towards the valley of the Rein da Nalps (Val Nalps) and passes east of Lai da Nalps, before crossing the Gannaretsch range below the western summit of Piz Vatgira (). This is the deepest point of the tunnel, with a rock layer of above it. The tunnel then passes below the valley of the Rein da Medel (Val Medel) and west of Lai da Sontga Maria. After a few kilometres the tunnel crosses the watershed between the Anterior Rhine and the Ticino, just north of Pizzo dell&#x27;Uomo (). This point corresponds to the main chain of the Alps, and is the main drainage divide between the Rhine and the Po. For a few kilometres, the tunnel passes below two western tributaries of the Brenno in the Valle Santa Maria before crossing the last range, west of the Passo Predèlp (about ) and east of Faido. It then follows the eastern slopes of the large Valle Leventina, the valley of the Ticino, for about to the south portal at Bodio, at an elevation of , just before Biasca, where the Brenno converges with the Ticino.

The closest railway stations to the portals are Altdorf and Biasca. The first regularly served railway stations on the base line (as of 2016/17) are those of Arth-Goldau (Schwyz), a railway node with links to Lucerne and Zürich, and Bellinzona (the &quot;Gate of Ticino&quot;), with links to Locarno, Luino and Lugano (via the Monte Ceneri Rail Tunnel). The journey from Arth-Goldau to Bellinzona takes not more than an hour. The station of Altdorf is planned to be served by 2021. There also have been talks of using that of Biasca. The travel between Altdorf and Biasca would last less than 25 minutes.

==History==
===Background===

Since the 13th century, the Gotthard Pass has been an important trade route from northern to southern Europe. Control of its access routes led to the birth of the Swiss Confederacy. The Gotthard Pass is located halfway between Lake Lucerne and Lake Maggiore. It is the shortest link between the navigable Rhine and the Po. Before modern transport, the traverse of the pass took days, and snow makes it a challenge in winter.

Quite late, compared to other current top-importance routes through the Alps (e.g. Simplon, San Bernardino, Brenner, Mont Cenis), namely in 1830, the first Saint-Gotthard Pass road was established after centuries-long usage of a bridle path. From 1842 onwards, a daily course by the &quot;Gotthard Post&quot;, a stagecoach drawn by five horses with ten seats, still took about 23 hours from Como to Flüelen. It would last until 1921.

In 1882, with the inauguration of the Gotthard Railway Tunnel, the travel time between Altdorf and Biasca was reduced dramatically to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in large Fin de siècle-hotels, for example in Biasca. In those days, it was still an adventure and it was only affordable to the rich. Electrification of the railway line in 1922 significantly reduced travel time again. Refilling water boilers of steam locomotives was no longer necessary. There were also the technical advantages of electrical engines and future technical improvements.

From 1924, car transport on trains through the railway tunnel began. The road between Göschenen and Airolo over the summit of the pass, comporting notably the Schöllenen ravine and the Tremola, had countless hairpin turns and serpentine curves, dropping in altitude. It posed a huge challenge for automobiles of those days. From 1953 onwards, the pass road was sequentially improved and expanded at several sections along the Gotthard route, finally ending in 1977 with the opening of an expressway fully circumventing the Tremola. In winter, however, due to the snow, cars could only cross the Gotthard on the train.

Transit time was further dramatically reduced with the opening of the Gotthard Road Tunnel and the finalization of the northern part of A2 motorway through the &quot;Urner Reusstal&quot; (in close proximity to the railway), with many additional tunnels (then leading from Basel to the Gotthard Road Tunnel), in 1980. With the completion in 1986 of the A2 motorway in the Valle Leventina, the main valley leading from Airolo down to Bellinzona, and the surmounting of the Monte Ceneri between Bellinzona and Lugano in 1983, finally a continuous motorway was established from the northern border of Switzerland in Basel to the southern border in Chiasso, or the shortest motorway route from North-German Hamburg as far as South-Italian Sicily, bringing down the competitiveness of the railway line. Passenger speed was also increased on the railway line with the use of tilting trains, notably the ICN, although maximum speed remaining far lower than on a modern straight high-speed line. Both modern motorway and historic railway rely on heavy rockfall and avalanche protection equipments and are exposed to harsh weather condition in winter.

After the opening of the auto tunnel, in 1980, traffic increased more than tenfold. The existing tunnel was at its capacity by 2013. A second tunnel will be built next to the first, following a national referendum. Construction started in 2021 and is scheduled to finish in 2027.
As early as 1947, engineer Eduard Gruner imagined a two-story base tunnel from Amsteg to Biasca, both rail and road, with a stop at Sedrun, to provide a faster and flatter passage through the Swiss Alps. Similarly to Gruner&#x27;s idea, the GBT cuts through the Gotthard Massif some below the older tunnel. On the historic track only the Gotthard Railway trains up to when using two locomotives or up to with an additional bank engine at the end of the train are able to pass through the narrow mountain valleys and through spiral tunnels climbing up to the portals of the old tunnel at a height of above sea level. Since the GBT is in full service, standard freight trains of up to are able to pass this natural barrier.

Because of ever-increasing international truck traffic, Swiss voters chose a shift in transportation policy in September 1992 by accepting the NRLA proposal. A second law, the &quot;Alpine Protection Act&quot; of February 1994, requires a shift of as much tonnage as possible from truck transport to train transport.

The goal of both the laws is to transport trucks, trailers and freight containers through Switzerland, from Basel to Chiasso, and beyond by rail to relieve the overused roads, and that of the Gotthard in particular, by using intermodal freight transport and rolling highways (where the entire truck is transported). The GBT substantially contributes to the requirements of both laws and enables a direct flat route from the ports of the North Sea (notably Rotterdam) to those of the Mediterranean Sea (notably Genoa), via the Rhine corridor.

Although the technical maximum speed is through the GBT, the maximal authorized speed has been reduced to for ecological and economical reasons, while the operating speed of passenger trains is restricted to in order to accommodate the freight traffic, with the possibility to accelerate up to in case of delay. At opening the GBT reduced travel times for trans-Alpine train journeys by about 40 minutes, and by one hour when the adjacent Zimmerberg and Ceneri Base Tunnels were completed. This is viewed as a revolution, especially in the isolated region of Ticino, which is separated from the rest of the country by the Alps and the Gotthard. The two stations of Bellinzona and Lugano (respectively named &quot;Gate of Ticino&quot; and &quot;Terrace of Ticino&quot;) were entirely renovated for the opening of the GBT, among other improvements.

As of 2016, the Gotthard Base Tunnel is the longest railway tunnel in the world. It is the third Swiss tunnel to bear this title, after the Gotthard Tunnel (, 1882) and the Simplon Tunnel (, 1905). It is the third tunnel built under the Gotthard, after the Gotthard Tunnel and the Gotthard Road Tunnel.

===Construction===
AlpTransit Gotthard AG was responsible for construction. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS).

To cut construction time in half, four access tunnels were built so that construction could start at four different sites simultaneously: Erstfeld, Amsteg, Sedrun, and Faido. A fifth at Bodio was added later. The two tunnels are joined approximately every by connecting galleries. Trains can move between the tunnels in the two multifunction stations at Sedrun and Faido. These stations house ventilation equipment and technical infrastructure and serve as emergency stops and evacuation routes.

Access to the Sedrun station site is by a level access tunnel long from the valley floor near Sedrun. At the end of the access tunnel, two vertical shafts lead down to the base tunnel level. A proposal to construct a functioning railway station, called &quot;Porta Alpina&quot; (from Romansh, &quot;Alpine Gate&quot;), at this site was evaluated, but the project was put on hold in 2007 and definitively cancelled by the federal authorities in 2012 as uneconomical.

The final breakthrough in the east tube occurred on 15 October 2010 at 14:17 +02:00. The final breakthrough in the west tube occurred on 23 March 2011 at 12:20.

On 30 August 2013, the tunnel was entirely traversed for the first time from Bodio to Erstfeld in six hours, by diesel train, buses and by foot.

On 16 December 2013, the operational test phase started on a stretch in the southern section of the west tube between Faido and Bodio. Its purpose was to test the infrastructure and any ancillary systems.

On 31 October 2014, the railway track installation was completed. A gold sleeper on the very last part of the track was installed during the event to mark this milestone of progress.

On 1 October 2015, following permission by the Federal Office of Transport, the first tests on the entire length of the GBT were performed, with steadily increasing speed. On 8 November, a train reached the top speed of .

====Allocation of work====

The contracts were awarded in sections:
* Erstfeld (the section from Erstfeld to Amsteg), with two tunnel boring machines (TBM) boring the two tubes. The break-through of the east tube between Erstfeld and Amsteg took place on 15 June 2009. The portal area was surface-mined.
* Amsteg (the section from Amsteg to north of Sedrun), ARGE AGN (Strabag and Züblin Murer) received the contract for work in this sector. On 9 December 2009, the Amsteg section was officially delivered to the owner for fitting-out, with civil engineering, construction, concrete and lining work completed in early 2010.
* Sedrun (the East tube and West tube in the section immediately north and south of Sedrun), along with work performed by Transco (Bilfinger SE, Implenia, Frutiger and Impresa Pizzarotti). The final breakthrough in the west tube occurred in March 2011. The northbound tubes from Amsteg to the Sedrun multifunction station (north) were handed over to the railway systems contractor Transtec Gotthard on 15 September 2011, the date specified in the construction schedule.
* Faido ( East tube and West tube in the section from south of Sedrun to Faido), with Consorzio TAT (Alpine Mayreder Bau, CSC Impresa costruzioni, Hochtief and Implenia and Impregilo).
* Bodio ( East tube and West tube in the section from Faido to Bodio), with work performed by Consorzio TAT (Alpine Mayreder Bau, CSC Impresa costruzioni, Hochtief, Implenia and Impregilo). Civil engineering construction, concrete and lining works were completed in early 2010.

====Deaths during construction====
Nine workers died during construction; one in the Amsteg section, two in the Sedrun section, and three each in the southernmost Faido and Bodio sections.
===Inauguration and commissioning===

In 2016, several events, including festivities and special exhibitions, were held around the Gotthard, culminating in the inaugurations in early June, dubbed &quot;Gottardo 2016&quot;. Public institutions joined the celebrations: Swiss Post issued a special stamp commemorating the Gotthard Base Tunnel, and Swissmint issued gold and silver coins dedicated to the opening.

On 31 May 2016, a day before the inauguration, the nine people who died during construction were commemorated in a ceremony at the north portal in Erstfeld that was led by a Catholic vicar general, a vicar of the Evangelical-Reformed Church of Uri, a Jewish rabbi, and a Muslim imam. A bronze memorial plaque with their names — four coming from Germany, three from Italy, and one from each of South Africa and Austria – was unveiled by AlpTransit Gotthard AG CEO Renzo Simoni. A Catholic shrine to Saint Barbara, the patron of miners, stands inside the tunnel as a memorial.
The tunnel was officially inaugurated on 1 June 2016. At the northern entrance in Erstfeld, President of the Confederation Johann Schneider-Ammann spoke of a &quot;giant step for Switzerland but equally for our neighbours and the rest of the continent&quot;, while a live relay carried a speech given by Transport Minister Doris Leuthard at the southern entrance in Bodio. The first journey carried hundreds of Swiss citizens who had won tickets in a draw, while the assembled guests in Erstfeld, including the Federal Council in corpore, heads of state and government from neighbouring countries and transport ministers from European countries, attended the opening show &quot;Sacre del Gottardo&quot; by Volker Hesse featuring 600 dancers, acrobats, singers and musicians celebrating Alpine culture and myths around the Gotthard. On the following weekend, popular festivities and special exhibitions, attended by more than 100,000 visitors, were held.

From 2 August to 27 November 2016, the Swiss Federal Railways ran a special train service through the tunnel called &quot;Gottardino&quot; which was open to the public. It was a once-daily service from Flüelen railway station to Biasca railway station and in reverse. The trains made a stop inside the tunnel, to allow passengers to visit an exhibition inside the underground multifunction station in Sedrun which would normally be used in emergency only.

===Regular services===

During 2016, the GBT was tested extensively before its integration into the regular schedule on 11 December. On 5 December, the Swiss Federal Railways were granted permission from the Federal Transport Office to use the new base line. While the base tunnel is used for InterCity trains (ICN) and EuroCity trains (EC), the vertex line remains in use for regional trains. Since 2019, the Gotthard axis is served by the Stadler EC250 (Giruno) high-speed train and future flagship of the SBB fleet.

From the Amsteg portal, guided tours are organised inside the Gotthard Base Tunnel complex. A window allows visitors to watch the trains running in the tunnel.

===2023 derailment and closure===
On 10 August 2023, a freight train derailed while traveling through the tunnel, causing extensive damage to the tunnel infrastructure. The incident occurred near the multi-functional station of Faido, in the canton of Ticino. No one was injured, and no hazardous materials were released.
The derailment caused significant damage to the tunnel, prompting its closure to both passenger and freight traffic. The tunnel returned to normal service on 2 September 2024.

==Politics==

The realization of the GBT, as the centrepiece of the NRLA, is also a prototypical example of direct democracy in Switzerland. In order to accomplish this mega-project the political institutions also had to overcome many parliamentary sessions and several major popular votes, including the following:

* 27 September 1992, NRLA proposal (mandatory referendum): The final proposal by the Federal Council was accepted by 63.6% yes votes (declined by 1+2/2 cantons, turnout 45.9%)
* 20 February 1994, Alps Initiative (federal popular initiative): Initiated by a few private people with the goal to protect the Alpine environment from the negative impact of traffic was accepted by 51.9% yes votes (declined by 7 cantons, turnout 41%). The initiative was accepted despite the recommendation by the Federal Council from 12 February 1992 to decline the initiative without any counterproposal, and despite the parliamentary recommendation (both chambers) from 18 June 1993 to decline the initiative.
* 29 November 1998, Public Transport Funding (mandatory referendum): A total budget of CHF 30 billion for several public transport projects was accepted by 63.5% yes votes (declined by 1+3/2 cantons, turnout 38.3%); &quot;the NRLA is to receive CHF 13.6 billion&quot;
* 21 May 2000, Bilateral EU Agreements / 40-tonne Trucks / Heavy Traffic Fee (optional referendum): As part of a whole package of several bilateral agreements with the EU the Swiss also accepted by 67.2% yes votes (declined by 2 cantons, turnout 48.3%) the shift of an upper limit for trucks from to , but at the same time the EU agreed to a new heavy-traffic fee, which would also be used to finance the NRLA
* 17 December 2003, Ceneri Base Tunnel (parliamentary session): The controversial funding of the Ceneri Base Tunnel was finally passed by parliamentary approval only; the possibility for an optional referendum was not raised by any political groups, nor by the public. The then-in-charge transport minister, Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger, was quoted as saying &quot;This is the only way to make the railway [the Gotthard axis] a flat line between Basel and Chiasso.&quot;

==Operation==
===Reduced travel times===

===Safety===

The safety requirements on the rolling stock are similar to those of other long Swiss tunnels, including the ability for the emergency brake to be overridden.

== 2023 freight train derailment ==
On 10th August 2023, a freight train heading north derailed inside the tunnel causing it to be shut. Trains scheduled to use the tunnel were either cancelled or redirected via the &quot;panorama route&quot; which added around one to two hours to journeys. Since the alternate route was unable to accommodate bi-level equipment, passenger capacity was reduced by around two thirds. According to an SBB press conference, around 8km of tracks, 20,000 concrete sleepers and a lane change gate in the tunnel were severely damaged. The gate is needed to separate the two tunnel tubes which is why the second tunnel could not initially be used to run trains. 

Experts from the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB) were dispatched to the site to preserve and document evidence of the crash. Investigators found fragments of a wheel and signs of derailment several kilometers before the crash site. At the Faido station, they discovered a pile of derailed wagons. The STSB&#x27;s mission is to determine the causes of accidents to ensure or improve safety, rather than to assign guilt or responsibility.
The STSB believes that the derailment was likely caused by a broken wheel tread inside the tunnel. All fragments of the wheel were found, consisting of several large pieces. The cause of the breakage has not yet been determined. External influence or fatigue fracture are possible explanations. The wheel fragments will be subjected to metallurgical analysis to determine the cause.
Despite the broken wheel, the wagon was dragged by the train for several kilometers. At the switching point of the multi-functional station, where trains can switch between the two tubes of the tunnel, the wagon derailed, pulling more than 20 following wagons off the tracks.

The tunnel&#x27;s repair work was extensive. Originally expected to be completed by the end of 2023, it was announced in November 2023 that the repairs would not be finished before September 2024, with the tunnel operating at reduced capacity until then. This was due to repairs requiring a complete replacement of seven kilometers of rails, including 20,000 sleeper blocks and their concrete foundations, a damaged lane-change gate, two high-speed switches and many other safety and operationally relevant parts. Freight trains were allowed to use the east tunnel from 23 August due to a temporary maintenance gate replacing the damaged one whilst passenger services remained rerouted.

Freight capacity in the tunnel was gradually increased on weekdays, while passenger services saw expansion on weekends. In case of emergency, passengers would be evacuated through the other tunnel tube. Following the reopening of the undamaged northern third of the western tube, additional freight and passenger services were scheduled to use the tunnel, with a full reopening and a return to normal service commencing on 2nd September 2024.

==Traffic==

Since the opening date on 1 June 2016, between 130 and 160 trains on an average working day operated through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, which in March 2019 marked the 100,000th transit. Around two-thirds of the passages were freight trains and the remaining quota were passenger trains, both national and international.

===Projections===

The number of projected trains per day was 180–260 freight trains and 50 (65 from 2020) passenger trains.

===Passengers===
After the opening of the tunnel there was an increase in passengers crossing the trans-alpine line, with 2.3 million passengers in the first 8 months, an increase of 30% over the previous year.

In August 2017, an average of 10,400 people crossed the tunnel daily. Train services from Italy to Switzerland through the line are expected to become faster from 2020, with the opening of the Ceneri Base Tunnel, with an expected further increase in passenger numbers.
There are plans for a train service between Zürich and Milan with a journey time of 2:45 hours, down from 3:50 hours.

===Freight===
 on 120 trains passed through the tunnel each day during the first half year of operation.

The sole operations of the bank is to manage a branch network in Iceland, with a 20%-40% market share across all domestic franchise areas. As of 2022, the bank has 12 branches around Iceland.

==First Íslandsbanki==
Íslandsbanki was originally created in 1990 through the merger of Alþýðubanki (Union Bank), Verzlunarbanki (Bank of Commerce) and Iðnaðarbanki (Industrial Bank). After its 2000 merger with FBA Icelandic Investment Bank, the bank was briefly renamed Íslandsbanki-FBA, but &quot;FBA&quot; was dropped from the name in 2002. In 2006, the bank again rebranded itself as Glitnir.

==Second Íslandsbanki==
The bank was re-established on 15 October 2008 under the name Nýi Glitnir (&quot;New Glitnir&quot;) to take over the Icelandic operations of Glitnir banki hf., after the 2008-2011 Icelandic financial crisis. The name was changed back to Íslandsbanki on 20 February 2009. The name Glitnir was deemed to be unreliable after the financial collapse, and a new logo was designed based on the old Glitnir and Íslandsbanki logos. Íslandsbanki was wholly owned by the Icelandic State Treasury from 2008 until 2021.

By the end of 2017, the bank had 861 full-time employees and a total amount of assets worth ISK 1.036 trillion, and its operations were divided into six business segments: &quot;Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Markets, Wealth Management, Treasury and Subsidiaries &amp; Equity Investments&quot;. The Bank has a 20–40% market share across all domestic franchise areas, and operates an efficient branch network in Iceland.

The directors, executives, and auditors of four Icelandic banks: Kaupthing Bank, Landsbanki, Glitnir/Íslandsbanki, and the Central Bank of Iceland, were awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 for demonstrating that tiny banks can be rapidly transformed into huge banks, and vice versa and for demonstrating that similar things can be done to an entire national economy. 

The current CEO is Jón Guðni Ómarsson.

=== Privatisation ===
In 2021, the Icelandic Government, in line with its plan, decided to begin the sell-off of Íslandsbanki in stages. In 2021, the government sold a 35% share in Íslandsbanki, with a further 22.5% being sold in March 2022. This brings the Icelandic State Treasury&#x27;s share in the bank at 42.5% as of 2022.

<doc id="692633" wikidata="Q783903" url="?curid=692633" title="Contact dermatitis">
<text>Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction. Irritant contact dermatitis is the most common type and represents 80% of all cases. It is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants, leading to direct injury of the epidermal cells of the skin, which activates an immune response, resulting in an inflammatory cutaneous reaction. Phototoxic dermatitis occurs when the allergen or irritant is activated by sunlight. Diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can often be supported by patch testing.

==Epidemiology==
Contact dermatitis constitutes 95% of all occupational skin disorders. There are few accurate statistics on the incidence and prevalence of contact dermatitis. The results of the few studies that have been undertaken cannot be compared because of methodological differences.

==Signs and symptoms==
Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Only the superficial regions of the skin are affected in contact dermatitis. Inflammation of the affected tissue is present in the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) and the outer dermis (the layer beneath the epidermis).

Contact dermatitis results in large, burning, and itchy rashes. These can take anywhere from several days to weeks to heal. This differentiates it from contact urticaria (hives), in which a rash appears within minutes of exposure and then fades away within minutes to hours. Even after days, contact dermatitis fades only if the skin no longer comes in contact with the allergen or irritant. Chronic contact dermatitis can develop when the removal of the offending agent no longer provides expected relief.

Irritant dermatitis is usually confined to the area where the irritating substance actually touched the skin, whereas allergic dermatitis may be more widespread on the skin. Irritant dermatitis is usually found on hands whereas exposed areas of skin. Symptoms of both forms include the following:
* Red rash: This is the usual reaction. The rash appears immediately in irritant contact dermatitis; in allergic contact dermatitis, the rash sometimes does not appear until 24–72 hours after exposure to the allergen.
* Blisters or wheals: Blisters, wheals (welts), and urticaria (hives) often form in a pattern where skin was directly exposed to the allergen or irritant.
* Itchy, burning skin: Irritant contact dermatitis tends to be more painful than itchy, while allergic contact dermatitis often itches.
* The surface appearance of skin: Skin is dry and fissured in the irritant contact dermatitis whereas vesicles and bullae are seen in allergic contact dermatitis.
* Lichenified lesions:

While either form of contact dermatitis can affect any part of the body, irritant contact dermatitis often affects the hands, which have been exposed by resting in or dipping into a container (sink, pail, tub, swimming pools with high chlorine) containing the irritant.

== Causes ==

The percentage of cases attributable to occupational contact dermatitis varies substantially depending on the industries that predominate, the employment that people have, the risks to which they are exposed, the centers that record cases, and variances in defining and confirming diagnoses.

Common causes of allergic contact dermatitis include: nickel allergy, 14K or 18K gold, Balsam of Peru (&quot;Myroxylon pereirae&quot;), and chromium. In the Americas they include the oily, urushiol-containing coating from plants of the genus &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;: poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Millions of cases occur each year in North America alone. The alkyl resorcinols in &quot;Grevillea banksii&quot; and &quot;Grevillea&quot; &#x27;Robyn Gordon&#x27; are responsible for contact dermatitis. Bilobol, another alkyl resorcinol found in &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; fruits, is also a strong skin irritant.

Common causes of irritant contact dermatitis include solvents, metalworking fluids, latex, kerosene, ethylene oxide, paper, especially papers coated with chemicals and printing inks, certain foods and drink, food flavorings and spices, perfume, surfactants in topical medications and cosmetics, alkalis, low humidity from air conditioning, and many plants. Other common causes of irritant contact dermatitis are harsh alkaline soaps, detergents, and cleaning products.

There are three types of contact dermatitis: irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; and photocontact dermatitis. Photocontact dermatitis is divided into two categories: phototoxic and photoallergic.

===Irritant contact dermatitis===
The irritant&#x27;s direct cytotoxic impact on epidermal keratinocytes causes Irritant contact dermatitis. This disrupts the skin barrier and activates the innate immune system. Keratinocytes in the epidermis can be actually affected by irritants. It is a complicated reaction that is influenced by genetic and environmental elements, both of which have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. It can be seen in both occupational and non-occupational environments but it&#x27;s more common in the occupations dealing in low humidity conditions.
Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) can be divided into forms caused by chemical irritants, and those caused by physical irritants. Common chemical irritants implicated include: solvents (alcohol, xylene, turpentine, esters, acetone, ketones, and others); metalworking fluids (neat oils, water-based metalworking fluids with surfactants); latex; kerosene; ethylene oxide; surfactants in topical medications and cosmetics (sodium lauryl sulfate); and alkalis (drain cleaners, strong soap with lye residues).

Physical irritant contact dermatitis may most commonly be caused by low humidity from air conditioning. Also, many plants directly irritate the skin.

===Allergic contact dermatitis===
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is accepted to be the most prevalent form of immunotoxicity found in humans, and is a common occupational and environmental health problem. By its allergic nature, this form of contact dermatitis is a hypersensitive reaction that is atypical within the population. The development of the disease occurs in two phases, which are induction and elicitation. The process of skin sensitization begins when a susceptible subject is exposed to the allergen in sufficient concentration to elicit the required cutaneous immune response. This causes sensitization and when exposure to the same allergen at a later time at the same or different skin site leads to a secondary immune response at the point of contact. The mechanisms by which this reaction occurs are complex, with many levels of fine control. Their immunology centres on the interaction of immunoregulatory cytokines and discrete subpopulations of T lymphocytes.

Allergens include nickel, gold, Balsam of Peru (&quot;Myroxylon pereirae&quot;), chromium, and the oily coating from plants of the genus &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;, such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Acrylates, rubber chemicals, emulsifiers and dyes, epoxy resin chemicals are just several of the substances that might induce Allergic Contact Dermatitis. Much of the allergic contact dermatitis that arises is caused by occupational exposure. Non-occupational exposure to allergens in medicaments, clothing, cosmetics, and plants are also a significant cause of allergic contact dermatitis.

===Photocontact dermatitis===

Sometimes termed &quot;photoaggravated&quot;, and divided into two categories, phototoxic and photoallergic, PCD is the eczematous condition which is triggered by an interaction between an otherwise unharmful or less harmful substance on the skin and ultraviolet light (320–400 nm UVA) (ESCD 2006), therefore manifesting itself only in regions where the affected person has been exposed to such rays.

Without the presence of these rays, the photosensitiser is not harmful. For this reason, this form of contact dermatitis is usually associated only with areas of skin that are left uncovered by clothing, and it can be soundly defeated by avoiding exposure to sunlight. The mechanism of action varies from toxin to toxin, but is usually due to the production of a photoproduct. Toxins which are associated with PCD include the psoralens. Psoralens are in fact used therapeutically for the treatment of psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo.

Photocontact dermatitis is another condition in which the distinction between forms of contact dermatitis is not clear-cut. Immunological mechanisms can also play a part, causing a response similar to ACD.

==Diagnosis==

Since contact dermatitis relies on an irritant or an allergen to initiate the reaction, it is important for the patient to identify the responsible agent and avoid it. This can be accomplished by having patch tests, one of various methods commonly known as allergy testing. The patch tests were based on the concept of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction where there is exposure of allergens to skin and checking for the development of contact dermatitis in that area. This test involves the application of suspected irritant to a part of the skin and cover it with impermeable material and attached to the skin with the help of adhesive plaster. The top three allergens found in patch tests from 2005 to 2006 were: nickel sulfate (19.0%), Myroxylon pereirae (Balsam of Peru, 11.9%), and fragrance mix I (11.5%). The patient must know where the irritant or allergen is found to be able to avoid it. It is important to also note that chemicals sometimes have several different names, and do not always appear on labels.

The distinction between the various types of contact dermatitis is based on a number of factors. The morphology of the tissues, the histology, and immunologic findings are all used in diagnosis of the form of the condition. However, as suggested previously, there is some confusion in the distinction of the different forms of contact dermatitis. Using histology on its own is insufficient, as these findings have been acknowledged not to distinguish, and even positive patch testing does not rule out the existence of an irritant form of dermatitis as well as an immunological one.

==Prevention==
In an industrial setting the employer has a duty of care to its worker to provide the correct level of safety equipment to mitigate exposure to harmful irritants. This can take the form of protective clothing, gloves, or barrier cream, depending on the working environment. It is impossible to eliminate the complete exposure to harmful irritants but can be avoided using the multidimensional approach. The multidimensional approach includes eight basic elements to follow. They are:
* Identification of possible cutaneous irritants and allergens
* To avoid skin exposure, use appropriate control measures or chemical substitutes.
* Personal protection can be achieved by the use of protective clothes or barrier creams.
* Maintenance of personal and environmental hygiene
* Use of harmful irritants in the workplace should be regulated
* Efforts to raise knowledge of potential allergies and irritants through education
* promoting safe working conditions and practices
* health screenings before and after employment and on a regular basis

Topical antibiotics should not be used to prevent infection in wounds after surgery. When they are used, it is inappropriate, and the person recovering from surgery is at significantly increased risk of developing contact dermatitis.

==Treatment==

===Self-care===
* If blistering develops, cold moist compresses applied for 30 minutes, 3 times a day can offer relief.
* Calamine lotion may relieve itching.
* Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Ben-Allergin) can relieve itching.
* Avoid scratching.
* Immediately after exposure to a known allergen or irritant, wash with soap and cool water to remove or inactivate most of the offending substance.
* For mild cases that cover a relatively small area, hydrocortisone cream in nonprescription strength may be sufficient.
* Weak acid solutions (lemon juice, vinegar) can be used to counteract the effects of dermatitis contracted by exposure to basic irritants.
* A barrier cream, such as those containing zinc oxide (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Desitin, etc.), may help protect the skin and retain moisture.

===Medical care===
If the rash does not improve or continues to spread after 2–3 of days of self-care, or if the itching and/or pain is severe, the patient should contact a dermatologist or other physician. Medical treatment usually consists of lotions, creams, or oral medications.
* Corticosteroids. A corticosteroid medication like hydrocortisone may be prescribed to combat inflammation in a localized area. It may be applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. If the reaction covers a relatively large portion of the skin or is severe, a corticosteroid in pill or injection form may be prescribed.

In severe cases, a stronger medicine like halobetasol may be prescribed by a dermatologist.
* Antihistamines. Prescription antihistamines may be given if non-prescription strengths are inadequate.

<text>or () is a Japanese multinational corporation that manufactures construction, mining, forestry and military heavy equipment, as well as diesel engines and industrial equipment like press machines, lasers and thermoelectric generators. Its headquarters are in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. The corporation was named after the city of Komatsu, Ishikawa Prefecture, where the company was founded in 1921. Worldwide, the Komatsu Group consists of Komatsu Ltd. and 258 other companies (215 consolidated subsidiaries and 42 companies accounted for by the equity method).

Komatsu is the world&#x27;s second largest manufacturer of construction equipment and mining equipment after Caterpillar. However, in some areas (Japan, China), Komatsu has a larger share than Caterpillar. It has manufacturing operations in Japan, Asia, Americas and Europe.

The word &quot;ko-matsu&quot; means &quot;small pine tree&quot; () in Japanese.

== History ==
Komatsu Iron Works was started by Takeuchi Mining Industry as a subsidiary to make industrial tools for the parent company. Komatsu eventually became large enough to sell to the public, and was spun off on May 13, 1921, as Komatsu Ltd and founded by Meitaro Takeuchi.

Komatsu produced its first agricultural tractor prototype in 1931. Through the 1930s, Komatsu also produced tractors for the Japanese military, as well as bulldozers, tanks and howitzers. After World War II, under its new president Yoshinari Kawai, Komatsu added non-military bulldozers and forklifts to its line of equipment. In 1949 it began production of its first diesel engine. Its growth as a company was aided by the strong demand for its bulldozers during Japan&#x27;s post-war reconstruction in the 1950s. In August 1951 the corporate headquarters were moved to Tokyo. By 1957 the company had advanced technologically to the point that all its models were using Komatsu engines.

In 1964, Rioichi Kawai, son of Yoshinari Kawai, became president of Komatsu, and it began exporting its products, looking to counteract the postwar image of Japanese products as being cheap and poorly made. In July 1967, it entered the U.S. market, taking on Caterpillar, the largest bulldozer maker, in its home market. This was done under the company slogan of &quot;Maru-C&quot;, translating into English as &quot;encircle Caterpillar&quot; (from the game of Go (board game), where encircling an opponent results in capture of his territory).

Expansion overseas was a major focus in the 1970s, with Komatsu America Corporation being established in February 1970 in the United States. A year later, in January 1971, Komatsu Singapore Pte. Ltd. was established in Singapore. September 1974 saw the founding of Dina Komatsu Nacional S.A. de C.V., a joint venture with truck maker DINA S.A. in Mexico. April 1975 was the founding Komatsu do Brasil Ltda. in Brazil. This company produced the Komatsu D50A bulldozer, marking Komatsu&#x27;s first offshore production of construction equipment. Komatsu Australia Pty., Ltd. in Australia was established in Feb. 1979.

In the 60&#x27;s the company entered the small engine market partnering with Fuji Motors Corporation building hand held engines. This partnership became the current brand Zenoah in 1973 under the company name Komatsu-Zenoah. Their products are sold in America under the name RedMax This brand&#x27;s products of brush trimmers and leaf blowers were sold under many names including Stihl, Echo, Shindaiwa, Toro, among others. They also are a large part of RC selling under the name Zenoah. April 2, 2007 Komatsu-Zenoah was sold to Husqvarna.

In the 1980s, Komatsu and International Harvester of the United States had a joint venture to produce compact tractors called KIMCO. In 1982, PT Komatsu Indonesia was founded and production began in 1983 in Indonesia. In 1985, two manufacturing divisions were established in the United States, including the company&#x27;s first U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Komatsu America Manufacturing Corp. and Komatsu America Industries LLC. Komatsu Industries Europe GmbH was set up in 1986 in then-West Germany.

In 1987, Komatsu and BEML formed a joint-venture known as BEML Komatsu.

Komatsu and Dresser Industries established &quot;Komatsu Dresser&quot; to make mining tractors and related equipment in 1988. This 50-50 ownership lasted from September 1988 to August 1994, when Komatsu bought out Dresser&#x27;s share. Komatsu&#x27;s mining products were consolidated under the name Komatsu Mining Systems in 1997. To prevent brand-name confusion during these corporate changes, the name &quot;Haulpak&quot; was used for the product line Komatsu began with Dresser. The name &quot;Haulpak&quot; dates back to 1957 when LeTourneau-Westinghouse introduced a range of rear dump trucks known as &quot;Haulpaks&quot;. LeTourneau-Westinghouse equipment later became known simply as WABCO equipment in 1967. The name Haulpak was an industry term that eventually became applied to any type of rear dump truck. A detailed history of the development of the Haulpak can be found in Wabco Australia.

In 1989, Komatsu bought a share of Hanomag AG and since 2002 Komatsu Hanomag GmbH has been a 100% subsidiary of the global company.

During the 1990s Komatsu had a joint venture in Europe with Moxy were Komatsu designed Articulated Dump Truck were built under license for the European market by Moxy. (In 2008 Moxy was taken over by Doosan of Korea.)

FAI of Italy was invested in during 1991. As Komatsu&#x27;s equity increased, the company was renamed in 1985 to FKI Fai Komatsu Industries S.p.A., which was then renamed in 2000 to &quot;Komatsu Utility Europe S.p.A.&quot; when Komatsu assumed 100% ownership.

Komatsu owns the former Demag range of Mining Machines, which have been upgraded but are basically the same, with the PC3000 being the old Demag H185, of which over 200 have been built under both brands/model numbers.

In 1993, two joint ventures were formed with Cummins; Komatsu Cummins Engine Corporation (KCEC) to manufacture Cummins engines in Japan, and the Cummins Komatsu Engine Corporation (CKEC) to manufacture Komatsu engines in the United States. Another joint venture was set up in 1997 to manufacture industrial engines in Japan.

Additional overseas expansion, primarily in Asia, was accomplished in the 1990s. Komatsu Vietnam Co., Ltd. in Vietnam in 1995; Komatsu Changlin Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (renamed Komatsu (Changzhou) Construction Machinery Corporation in November 2000) in Changzhou, China, in 1995; Komatsu Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. in 1995; Bangkok Komatsu Co., Ltd. in Thailand; Komatsu (Shanghai) Ltd. in 1996 in Shanghai, China; Industrial Power Alliance Ltd. in Japan, a joint venture with Cummins, in 1998; L&amp;T-Komatsu Limited in India in 1998 (shares sold in 2013); and Komatsu Brasil International Ltda. in Brazil in 1998.

The 2000s saw Komatsu working with The Linde Group of Germany for sales and manufacturing of lift trucks. In 2001, Komatsu established &quot;GALEO&quot; as a new brand of new-generation construction equipment for worldwide distribution. 2002, Komatsu Italy S.p.A. was established. In 2004, Komatsu Forest AB was established to purchase Sweden&#x27;s Partek Forest AB, formerly Valtra and Valmet, a manufacturer of forest machinery. Also in 2004, founded Komatsu Zenoah (Shandong) Machine Co., Ltd in China, (renamed Komatsu Utility Machine Co., Ltd. in 2007), to manufacture mini excavators and hydraulic equipment, as well as founding Komatsu Power Generation Systems (Shanghai) Ltd. to manufacture power generators. Komatsu Forklift Manufacturing (China) Co., Ltd was also founded in 2004 in China to produce forklifts.

Komatsu moved into Russia in 2008 with Komatsu Manufacturing Rus, LLC being founded, and production began in 2010. Sites included Kaluga oblast Sankt Petersburg (1), Yaroslavl (1), Moscow area (2 - 3), Krasnodar (1), and Ekaterinburg and in Kemerovo Oblast (1). According to Komatsu operations in Russia were suspended in 2022.

In 2016, Komatsu agreed to acquire Joy Global for 3.7 B(US$). Joy Global was the reorganized and recapitalized entity of Harnischfeger Industries of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US. Harnischfeger Industries was a holding company that consisted of Joy Manufacturing Co., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a maker of underground coal mining equipment; P&amp;H Mining Equipment, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a maker of large open pit mining equipment which includes electric rope shovels, blast hole drills and draglines, P&amp;H MinePro Services, a product support entity that provides parts and service support for all types and makes of open pit and underground mining equipment, LeTourneau Manufacturing of Longview, Texas, a maker of large rubber tired wheel loaders. The acquisition was completed in April 2017, operating as separate subsidiary with the US headquarters located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US and renamed Komatsu Mining Corp.

In 2019, Komatsu withdrew from the defense sector. They cited the shrinking Japanese defense budget, poor performance, restrictions on exporting Komatsu-made military vehicles, heavy competition with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and lack of synergy with its other businesses. As of 2014, Komatsu is manufacturing the NBC Reconnaissance Vehicle for the JGSDF.

In December 2022, it was announced Komatsu had acquired the Gelsenkirchen-headquartered manufacturer of underground mining, tunnelling and special civil engineering equipment, GHH Group GmbH.

In November 2023, Komatsu announced the acquisition of American Battery Solutions to accelerate equipment electrification.

<doc id="692638" wikidata="Q1063464" url="?curid=692638" title="Landsbanki">
<text>Landsbanki (, ), also commonly known as Landsbankinn (, ) was one of the largest Icelandic commercial banks; it failed as part of the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis when its subsidiary sparked the Icesave dispute. On October 7, 2008, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority took control of Landsbanki and created a new bank for all the domestic operations called Nýi Landsbanki (New Landsbanki) and the bank continued to operate under the same name.

Prior to its failure, the bank was one of the largest Icelandic banks with assets of ISK 3,058 billion in December 2007 and a market capitalization of ISK 383 billion. It began operation in 1885 and was instrumental in the economic development of business and industry in Iceland. From 1927 to 1961, the bank acted as the central bank until it was replaced by the Central Bank of Iceland, although this interest was primarily directed towards note issuance rather than monetary policy. The bank had been state-owned and was privatized in stages between 1998 and 2003.

Landsbanki had positioned itself as Iceland&#x27;s primary provider of general and specialized financial services to individuals, corporate entities, and institutions. The bank had the country&#x27;s most extensive branch network with 40 branches and sub-branches. At the end of 2006, Landsbanki provided close to 40% of corporate lending in Iceland, and for around 60% of companies listed on the OMX Iceland Stock Exchange, Landsbanki was their principal bank or one of two banks with whom they did business. The leading provider of M&amp;A, derivatives, equity and fixed income services.

It started to expand overseas in 2000 through a number of acquisitions and organic growth, the expansion would lead to the creation of its Icesave subsidiary in 2006 which would ultimately seal its fate.

== History ==

In establishing Landsbanki, the Icelandic parliament hoped to boost monetary transactions and encourage the country&#x27;s nascent industries. Following its opening on 1 July 1886, the bank&#x27;s first decades of operation were restricted by its limited financial capacity; it was little more than a savings and loan society. Following the turn of the 20th century, however, Icelandic society progressed and prospered as industrialization finally made inroads, and the bank grew and developed in parallel to the nation. In the 1920s, Landsbanki became Iceland&#x27;s largest bank and was made responsible for issuing its banknotes. After the issuing of banknotes was transferred to the newly established Central Bank of Iceland in 1961, Landsbanki continued to develop as a commercial bank, expanding its branch network in the ensuing decades.

While still publicly owned it went through a state-directed merger with Samvinnubanki (Cooperative Bank).

Liberalisation of financial services, beginning in 1986, opened up new opportunities, which the bank managed to take advantage of despite some economic adversity. In 1997, Landsbanki was incorporated as a limited-liability company, and the ensuing privatization finally concluded in 2003. Landsbanki then operated as a privately owned bank, competing in a free market, with substantial international activities added to its traditional Icelandic operations.

=== International expansion ===
The relatively limited size of the Icelandic market prompted Landsbanki, the first among Icelandic commercial banks, to expand and diversify outside of Iceland when it acquired the London-based Heritable Bank in 2000. In 2005, Landsbanki acquired three Europe securities houses: Teather &amp; Greenwood, located in London and Edinburgh; Kepler Capital Markets, headquartered in Paris; and Merrion Capital Group in Dublin. These subsidiaries dealt in securities and prepared equity research in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Zürich, Nyon (25 km from Geneva), Milan, Madrid and Amsterdam. Landsbanki&#x27;s own branches in London and Amsterdam specialized in structured finance and commercial finance (asset-based lending), while Landsbanki Luxembourg handled private banking and wealth management, as well as corporate services.

On 9 August 2007 Landsbanki completed its acquisition of UK investment bank Bridgwell plc. The operations of Teather &amp; Greenwood were combined with those of Bridgewell under the brand name Landsbanki Securities (UK). The acquisition of Bridgewell made Landsbanki the second largest broker to listed companies on the London Stock Exchange measured by the number of clients.

In December 2008 Kepler Capital Markets is sold to management and staff through a management-led buy-out (MBO).

=== Icesave ===

An online savings account program for the UK market, Icesave, was launched in October 2006. Icesave grew rapidly, and on 31 March 2007, its deposits totaled £2.8 bn with over 80,000 accounts opened.

A key factor in Icesave&#x27;s appeal to savers was its interest rate guarantee: The gross Annual Equivalent Rate of Interest (AER) paid on balances over £250 was guaranteed to exceed the Bank of England Base Rate by at least 0.25% until 1 October 2009 and thereafter not to be lower than the Bank of England Base Rate until 1 October 2011. As a result, Icesave quickly became the market leader in Internet deposit savings accounts in the UK in terms of interest rates.

Icesave operated in the Netherlands from May 2008 until October 2008.

On 7 October 2008 the Icesave UK website announced: &quot;We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our customers. We hope to provide you with more information shortly.&quot; and Icesave was declared in default on 8 October 2008, taking Landsbanki with it in its fall.

=== 2008 financial crisis ===
On October 7, 2008, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority took control of Landsbanki. A press release by the IFSA states that all of Landsbanki&#x27;s domestic branches, call centers, ATMs, and internet operations will be open for business as usual and that all domestic deposits are fully guaranteed. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Government had moved quickly to use the sweeping powers granted by the Reykjavik parliament, the night before. The country&#x27;s financial regulator said on Tuesday that Landsbanki&#x27;s branches would open as usual and that all “domestic deposits” were fully guaranteed. The next day the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that his government would foot the entire bill for British Icesave savers, estimated at £4 billion, and that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki using the financial freezing-orders provisions of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

Under the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008, passed on 8 October 2008, Her Majesty&#x27;s Treasury froze the assets of Landsbanki in the UK, and assets belonging to the Central Bank of Iceland, and the Government of Iceland relating to Landsbanki.

On 9 October 2008 the domestic, Icelandic branch was split off into the NBI, (New Landsbanki) and on 27 October 2008 the inability to render payment of deposits was declared for the remaining parts of Landsbanki.

== Sponsorship of sports: Landsbankadeildin ==
Landsbanki&#x27;s sponsorship of football was an important aspect of the Bank&#x27;s marketing and image policy. In September 2005, an agreement was concluded with the Football Association of Iceland, under which the Icelandic premier league for both men and women will be called the Landsbanki Premier League (Landsbankadeildin) for the next four seasons.

== Landsbanki liquidation and repayment of claims ==
On 28 January 2013, the EFTA Court cleared Iceland of all charges, meaning that no loan agreement will be settled between the Icelandic state and the UK and the Netherlands, to guarantee their claim for repayment of Icelandic minimum deposit guarantees worth €4.0bn plus accrued interests. This claim will however still exist towards the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot; as a so-called &quot;First priority claim&quot;, and will be met in full if the receivership succeeds to liquidate assets with a value equal to or in excess of this first priority liability.

The combined deposit repayment claims from retail Icesave customers in the Netherlands and Great Britain (including both the minimum depositor guarantees and the deposit values in excess of the Icelandic guarantee), were at first hand covered respectively by the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), due to the inability/unwillingness for other Icelandic stakeholders to step in and ensure/guarantee immediate coverage for these claims. On 28 October 2011, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, that the UK FSCS and the Dutch DNB combined deposit repayments of respectively ISK 852.1bn (£4.459bn) and ISK 282.3bn (€1.668bn) should be repaid by the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot; as &quot;priority claims&quot; pursuant to Article 112 of &quot;Act No.21/1991 on Bankruptcy&quot;, and noted these mentioned figures included contractual interest rates for the UK part and some extra penalty interest rates (6%) for the Dutch part for the period from 8 October 2008 until 22 April 2009. Together these two claims amounts to ISK 1134.4bn (€6.704bn), which is equal to 86% of all &quot;priority claims&quot; towards the Landsbanki receivership. Among the other priority claims are also ISK 145.4bn deposit repayment claims (equal to 11% of all &quot;priority claims&quot;), submitted directly by more than 200 wholesale Icesave customers in the Netherlands and Great Britain, who initially received no repayment from their national authorities, but will now get repayment on equal terms - with equal priority status - from the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot;.

As of 30 June 2013, the total value of the assets in the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot; (including the already repaid part of the claims) covered ISK 1531bn (€9.1bn), which was above the total amount of the priority claims at ISK 1325bn (€7.8bn). The final overall value for the assets is however still subject to change, as the receivership for various reasons has been granted extra time to liquidate all remaining assets until 2018, at a pace equal to approximately ISK 100bn per year. Repayment to the creditors happens step by step at the same pace as the liquidation of assets happens. The repayments so far happened through four tranches in 2011–2013, which already included a full repayment of all minimum deposit guarantees, due to their first priority status within the &quot;priority claims&quot;. As of 12 September 2013, the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot; had through liquidation of the first half of its assets, managed to repay the first 53.9% (ISK 715.2bn) of all the priority claims.

According to the latest evaluation of the planned recovery of asset values, it is expected all &quot;Priority claims&quot; will have been fully repaid by the end of 2017. Any additional claims for accrued interests after 22 April 2009 due to the delayed repayment of priority claims, will only be treated as secondary &quot;General claims&quot;, and thus only be repaid once all of the &quot;Priority claims&quot; have been repaid in full, and then only to the extent it is possible on an equal footing together with all the other remaining ISK 1677bn (€9.9bn) of &quot;General claims&quot; towards the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot;.


According to the Landsbanki Receivership&#x27;s initial interpretation of the Icelandic law, the creditor claims in foreign currency towards a liquidated Icelandic financial company in receivership should only be repaid by an ISK-equivalent amount as per the currency exchange rate registered on the date when winding-up proceedings were initiated; which was as per 22 April 2009 for the Landsbanki receivership. Moreover, it was believed the creditors had no legal right to claim compensation towards the Landsbanki receivership for any potential losses they may suffer, because of exchange rate fluctuations after 22 April 2009. On 26 September 2013, the Icelandic Supreme Court however ruled against this initial law interpretation of the Landsbanki Receivership, concluding all creditors should be fully repaid with currency amounts equal to the denoted local currency of their claim; meaning that when repaid with other currencies, then valuation of this amount should be calculated by converting it to the claim&#x27;s denoted currency, according to the foreign currency exchange rates registered by the Icelandic Central Bank on the repayment date. Thus ensuring that all creditors bare no currency exchange risks, with these risks -and potential financial burdens- instead to be upheld solely by the receivership.

As the Receivership mainly holds bank assets valuated in foreign currencies, the repayment of claims is likewise expected to be conducted through partial repayments mainly in foreign currencies, equal to the available cash currency basket stemming from liquidated assets on the payment day. Because of the currency mix being more or less equal when comparing the Claims with the held Assets, the risk for currency exchange losses is expected to be relatively low for the receivership. The table below provides an overview of the currency composition of the first 3 partial repayments and how currency exchange rates were at the time compared to 22 April 2009.


===How capital controls impact creditor repayment===
Iceland elected a new government in April 2013, which as one of their top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. As the current capital controls only ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and as 97% of the Landsbanki receivership total assets are held only in foreign currency, this new Icelandic initiative will, however, most likely not affect the repayment scheme for the priority claim creditors in the Landsbanki receivership - who at the moment are forecasted to be fully repaid by the first 91.2% of the receivership assets. So even if the current capital controls remain in force at an indefinite time horizon, it will only be the last 3.2% of the assets (ISK 49/1531bn) that remain to be frozen or trapped in Iceland and can not be directly repaid, which then only would negatively impact the return rate for the creditors with general claims.

The only minor risk for the receivership&#x27;s &quot;priority claim creditors&quot; seems to be, that the receivership might face political demands to extend the maturity of its owned &quot;Glacier bonds&quot; towards the New Landsbanki, as part of the Icelandic government&#x27;s overall capital control abolition initiative, which would then delay liquidation of this specific asset. The nicknamed &quot;Glacier bonds&quot;, concern two bonds with a total value of ISK 297bn (€1.76bn), that currently are due for yearly repayments in foreign currency from New Landsbanki to the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot;, during the period 2014-2018. These specific repayment transfers are by some people speculated to be impossible, if the capital controls gets abolished, as such abolishment would be expected to drain the foreign capital reserves held by New Landsbanki; and thus a deal to remove capital controls is speculated will also need to imply a prolonged maturity (or repayment agreement) for these bonds.

The Icelandic government intends somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors belonging to the receivership estates of Kaupthing and Glitnir, into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. Experts from IMF however belief, that any potentially saved money from a negotiated deal, would be eaten up by the additional costs the government will need to pay in the short term, for implementing the abolishment of capital controls. In July 2013, Standard &amp; Poors recommended Iceland drop the debt relief initiative, as they also believe it would only result in increased debt for the government - making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and the debt relief initiative was forecasted also to ignite high inflation pressures along with risk for the arrival of a new economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The Icelandic government has appointed a task force to present proposals on how to achieve the government&#x27;s goals, with a reporting deadline in November 2013.

===New creditor repayment restrictions===
On 12 March 2012, the Icelandic government amended - by Act No 17/2012 - the existing Act No 87/1992 on Foreign Exchange, so that paragraph five of Article 13n now represents new currency restrictions for repayment of foreign currency to creditors in any receivership estates. In that regard, it shall be noted that all of the first 4 repayment tranches repaid by the &quot;Landsbanki Receivership&quot; were exempted from this amended law, because it only involved available cash stemming from liquidation conducted ahead of 12 March 2012. All future repayment tranches will however be impacted by the amended law, which stipulates that the Icelandic minister of finance and minister of banking have to agree on exemptions granted by the Icelandic Central Bank for all future claim repayments stemming from companies with a larger balance sheet than ISK 400bn, even if it only involves a transfer of foreign currency. This means, that the Icelandic state now potentially also can block any further repayment of foreign currency to the creditors of the &quot;Landsbanki receivership&quot;. No court has yet judged, if this extended power of the Icelandic State, also decides the pace of foreign currency repayments, and not only ISK currency repayments are legal or illegal.

Another new repayment restriction under consideration is that the Icelandic government on 1 October 2013 presented a proposal for their 2014 budget law, to include a new 0.145% tax on all transfers from estates of failed financial companies. Some lawyers however have the opinion, that this kind of tax on failed companies could be seen as an illegal expropriation by the Icelandic state. If the Icelandic government passes this proposed law, it will almost with certainty become challenged in a lawsuit by the receivership estates behind the three failed Icelandic banks.

<text>William Lance Burton (born March 10, 1960) is an American stage magician. He performed more than 15,000 shows in Las Vegas for over 5,000,000 people until retiring in 2010. He serves as a judge on &quot;Criss Angel&#x27;s Magic with the Stars&quot;.

==Professional history==
Burton first became interested in magic at the age of 5, when he was one of the volunteers at a magic show of Magician Harry Collins. The trick was The Miser&#x27;s Dream, where Collins &quot;pulled silver dollars out of the sky&quot; and Burton&#x27;s ears. The young Burton was fascinated, and a neighbor, hearing of his interest, gave him a book, &quot;Magic Made Easy&quot;, which her own (then-grown) children had used. It contained ten tricks, all of which young Burton quickly learned. His first performances were for neighborhood children, charging them a nickel each.

Collins, a full-time magician, noticed the interest, and became his mentor when Burton was in his teens, teaching him the fundamentals of the trade. Another of Burton&#x27;s influences was his mentor Channing Pollock, who influenced Burton&#x27;s card manipulation and use of doves. In 1977, as a teenager, Burton entered his first magic competition and won first prize. In 1980, shortly after his 20th birthday, he was awarded a &quot;Gold Medal of Excellence&quot; from the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Soon after, Burton moved to Southern California, where within a week he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (on October 28, 1981). Through the course of Burton&#x27;s career he was invited back for a total of ten performances while Johnny Carson was host, and another ten performances during Jay Leno&#x27;s tenure. Burton has also appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;.

He performed an initial eight-week trial at the &quot;Folies Bergère&quot; show in Las Vegas, and then had his contract extended for a record-breaking nine years. In 1982, he competed at the international Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques (FISM) competition in Lausanne, Switzerland, and won the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; prize (the main event of the FISM competition). He was the youngest person to ever win the main event, and the first American to do so.

In 1991, he produced, directed, and wrote his own show, which opened at the Hacienda Hotel and ran for five years. He had a brief marriage to magician Melinda Saxe in August 1993, but they divorced shortly after. In August 1994, Burton signed a 13-year contract (the longest contract given, at that point, to any entertainer in Las Vegas history) with the Monte Carlo Resort in Las Vegas. The 1,274-seat &quot;Lance Burton Theater&quot; was built to Burton&#x27;s specifications for his show, cost $27 million, and opened on June 21, 1996. &quot;Entertainment Today&quot; magazine listed it as the #1 family magic act, and during its 13-year run Burton earned an estimated $110 million.

In 2004, Burton celebrated his tenth anniversary at the Monte Carlo by introducing an illusion entitled &quot;Solid Gold Lady&quot;, for which he used $10 million in gold. In 2006, he appeared on the Labor Day Weekend &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot;. On July 1, 2009, Burton signed a six-year contract extension with the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, which would continue his contract until 2015. However, the contract was ended five years earlier than planned, and the final show was performed on September 4, 2010.

In 2020 Lance Burton performed in Blackpool, England.

===Television appearances===
In 1986, Burton guest starred in a fourth season episode &quot;Knight Rider&quot; titled &quot;Deadly Knightshade&quot; as the mastermind magician behind the murder of a Foundation trustee. In 1986, he appeared in Nickelodeon&#x27;s Halloween special &quot;Mystery Magical Special&quot;.

Burton starred in several network television specials, including
* &quot;The Legend Begins&quot; (1996)
* &quot;The Encounter&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Top Secret&quot; (1998)
* &quot;On The Road&quot; (2001)

For his &quot;Top Secret&quot; special that first aired on February 24, 1999, at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Hotel &amp; Casino in Primm, Nevada, Burton staged an illusion in which he appeared to escape the path of a speeding roller coaster while on the tracks of &quot;The Desperado&quot;. The Desperado is one of the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the United States – taking one minute to climb, and 3.5 seconds to descend to where he was on the tracks. He appeared to avoid the coaster by a mere tenth of a second, the trick having apparently gone wrong. After the &quot;narrow escape&quot;, he looked at the camera and said &quot;That was stupid...That was &quot;really&quot; stupid.&quot;

Burton appeared on an episode of the History channel series &quot;American Restoration&quot;, televised November 1, 2010, in which the &quot;Rick&#x27;s Restorations&quot; crew repaired a light pole at Burton&#x27;s residence that had been destroyed in a windstorm.

In 2022, Lance Burton was a guest judge on &quot;Criss Angel&#x27;s Magic with the Stars&quot; on The CW.

==Awards==
*The Academy of Magical Arts has twice awarded him &quot;Magician of the Year&quot; (1985, 1991), and also given him a Masters Fellowship (2010).
* 1982 Grand Prix Award at FISM for a performance in which he stood in a street scene in traditional top hat and tails and produced doves, candles and gentleman&#x27;s walking canes.
* 1997 Blackstone Theatre Award.
* 2016 David Devant Award from The Magic Circle, given &quot;to those who have made a significant contribution in advancing the art of magic.&quot;

<doc id="692652" wikidata="Q1047663" url="?curid=692652" title="Stakeout (1987 film)">
<text>Stakeout is a 1987 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by John Badham and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn. The screenplay was written by Jim Kouf, who won a 1988 Edgar Award for his work. Although the story is set in Seattle, the film was shot in Vancouver. A sequel, &quot;Another Stakeout&quot;, followed in 1993.

The film later inspired the 1989 Malayalam-language film &quot;Vandanam&quot; and 1991 Telugu-language film &quot;Nirnayam&quot;.

==Plot==

Detectives Chris Lecce and Bill Reimers are assigned to the night shift on a stakeout of Latina waitress Maria McGuire. Her former boyfriend, Richard &quot;Stick&quot; Montgomery, has escaped from Stonehurst Prison following a staged brawl with his cellmate with help from his cousin, Caylor Reese, who escaped with him in a truck.

The FBI asks for cooperation from Lecce and Reimers in capturing Montgomery. They believe he may return to an old girlfriend, Maria McGuire, who lives in Seattle. Meanwhile, Lecce is going through a divorce. He comes home and finds out that his wife moved out, taking the furniture and leaving him in despair.

Montgomery telephones Maria but the line gets cut off so the call cannot be traced. He has a large amount of money he secretly hid in an armchair prior to his incarceration. Lecce and Reimers spy on Maria, hoping Montgomery will turn up at her door so they can arrest him. Lecce pretends to be a telephone lineman, to get close to Maria. He also helps her brother Ray to get a job to stay out of trouble.

Fate takes a turn as Lecce falls in love with Maria and the Seattle Police suspect him as being one of Montgomery&#x27;s allies. While Lecce is asleep in Maria&#x27;s bed, Montgomery and Reese break into her house, with Montgomery shooting Lecce in the face. Lecce wakes up, however, to find out it was only a nightmare. Realizing he slept in, he must leave the house without being seen. At the police station, Reimers scolds him for sleeping with Maria, and reminds him he is a good cop who made one mistake.

After killing a cashier in a gas station, Montgomery and Reese have a run-in with several officers waiting for them outside Seattle, causing a shootout and their car crashes into the river. Montgomery escapes from the vehicle before it sinks, but Reese is wounded and dies in the sunken car.

Lecce tells his secret to Maria, but she starts to get upset, only to run into Montgomery, who tells Chris and Maria that he stashed half-million dollars in a couch that he bought for her years prior. He was hoping that he and Maria would have a great life together in Canada, but Lecce ruined it.

After capturing Reimers, Montgomery plans to murder both cops. The climax of the film takes place at a paper mill, where Lecce and Montgomery have a shootout, resulting in Montgomery being shot in the chest. Maria and Lecce start a relationship.

The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez make for great company during this &quot;Stakeout&quot;, a bawdy procedural that mines great pleasure from the odd couple&#x27;s comedic chemistry.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<doc id="692654" wikidata="Q6929814" url="?curid=692654" title="Mrs Mary Eales's Receipts">
<text>Mrs. Mary Eales&#x27;s Receipts was published in London by Mary Eales in 1718 and again in 1733, the second time also under the title of &quot;The Compleat Confectioner&quot;. It was published in 1744 with an additional called &quot;A curious collection of receipts in cookery, pickling, family physick, &amp;c.&quot; added by the publisher, R. Montagu. (The author of the latter part is unknown.) A facsimile of the 1733 edition was published in 1985 by Prospect Books ().

==Identity of the writer==
Mrs. Mary Eales is listed on the cover as confectioner to her late Majesty Queen Anne; there is no external verification or disproval of this claim. It was the first English cookbook to include a recipe for ice cream. Many of the recipes are of the form of &quot;To preserve something&quot;, or &quot;To dry something&quot;, with many of the rest being recipes for creams, jams, jellies, or pastes, with the occasional chip, cake or biscuit recipe. The 1733 edition has 126 recipes and is exactly 100 pages long, plus the title page and table of contents.
==Examples of recipes==

Two of the 126 recipes in the 1733 edition:

:To ice CREAM.

:Take Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten&#x27;d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; than take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou&#x27;d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten&#x27;d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.

:To dry GOOSBERRIES.

:Take the large white Goosberries before they are very ripe, but at full Growth, stone and wash them, and to a Pound of Goosberries put a Pound and half of Sugar, beat very fine, and half a Pint of Water; set them on the Fire; when the Sugar is melted, let them boil, but not too fast; take them off once or twice, that they may not break; when they begin to look clear, they are enough: Let them stand all Night in the Pan they are boil&#x27;d in, with a Paper laid close to them; the next Day scald them very well, and let them stand a Day or two; then lay them on Plates, sift them with Sugar very well, and put them in the Stove, turning them every Day &#x27;till they are dry; the third Time of turning, you may lay them on a Sieve, if you please; when they are pretty dry, place them in a Box, with Paper betwixt every Row.

<text>Larenz Tate (born September 8, 1975) is an American film and television actor. He is best known for his roles as O-Dog in &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, Anthony Curtis in &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, and as Councilman Rashad Tate in &quot;Power&quot;. Tate&#x27;s other films and television series include the films &quot;The Inkwell&quot;, &quot;Love Jones&quot;, &quot;A Man Apart&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, &quot;Waist Deep&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot; and the television series &quot;Rush&quot; and &quot;Game of Silence&quot;.

== Early life ==
Tate was born in Chicago, to Peggy and Larry Tate. He is the youngest of three siblings; his two brothers, Larron and Lahmard, are also actors. The family moved to California during the early 1980s. Convinced by their parents to enter a drama program at the Inner City Cultural Center, the trio did not take the lessons seriously until classmate Malcolm-Jamal Warner&#x27;s ascent to fame after being cast on the sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Subsequently, realizing that they could parlay their efforts into a tangible form of success, the siblings began to receive small roles and in 1985, Tate made his small-screen debut in an episode of &quot;The New Twilight Zone&quot;. Tate attended Palmdale High School, graduating in 1993.

== Career ==
Following appearances in such television series as &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, Tate was cast in the television movie &quot;The Women of Brewster Place&quot; before receiving the recurring role of Steve Urkel&#x27;s nemesis, Willie Fuffner, in the sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;. He also appeared as Curtis, a grandson of Redd Foxx&#x27;s character on the CBS series &quot;The Royal Family&quot;. Foxx died of a heart attack a month after &quot;The Royal Family&quot; debuted, and a reworking with Jackée Harry as part of the cast failed to save the series. 

After numerous acting roles on television, collaborative filmmaking siblings Albert and Allen Hughes approached him to star in their debut feature &quot;Menace II Society&quot; in 1993. In the film, Tate portrayed &quot;O-Dog&quot;, a trigger-happy teenager. Frederick I. Douglass of the Baltimore Black-American opined Tate&#x27;s performance in the film made it an instant classic. Tate had a regular role on the short-lived television series &quot;South Central&quot; (1994) as Andre. 

Tate acted in &quot;The Inkwell&quot; (1994) as Drew. One reviewer praised his performance and called Tate a &quot;promising&quot; actor. However, in negative reviews Tate was seen as &quot;overacting&quot; and compared unfavorably to Jim Carrey. In 1995, Tate portrayed Vietnam veteran Anthony Curtis in the Hughes brothers&#x27; &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;. A film reviewer stated Tate proved he could play sympathetic characters with his performance in the film. 

He took on the role of love-stricken young poet Darius in &quot;Love Jones&quot; (1997). Critic Jay Carr found Tate &quot;engaging&quot; in the role. Tate also played Kenny in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; in the episode &quot;That&#x27;s No Lady, That&#x27;s My Cousin&quot;, which was produced by Quincy Jones who Tate would later portray in the 2004 film &quot;Ray&quot;.

In 1997, Tate appeared as Ford Lincoln Mercury in &quot;The Postman&quot;. He played Frankie Lymon in the biopic &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1998). One critic praised Tate&#x27;s dancing prowess in the film. He was the lead character, Neville, in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Love Come Down&quot;. 

Throughout the 2000s, Tate continued his film career. Tate portrayed Vin Diesel&#x27;s drug officer partner in &quot;A Man Apart&quot; (2003), with his other film work including &quot;Biker Boyz&quot; (2003), &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), and &quot;Waist Deep&quot; (2006). Tate was featured in R&amp;B singer Ashanti&#x27;s 2003 released music video &quot;Rain on Me&quot;, where he played the jealous, abusive spouse of Ashanti. The video touched on the subject of domestic abuse. In the video game &quot;187 Ride or Die&quot;, Tate voices the main character, Buck.

Tate portrayed Shooter Cooper in &quot;Love Monkey&quot;, which was cancelled after three episodes. He starred in seasons 4-7 of FX&#x27;s &quot;Rescue Me&quot; as Bart &quot;Black Shawn&quot; Johnston. Tate appeared as Malcolm, the brother of Don Cheadle&#x27;s character, in &quot;House of Lies&quot; and guest starred on an episode of &quot;The Mindy Project&quot;. Tate starred as beta tester Max in &quot;Beta Test&quot; (2016) and appeared in the 2017 film &quot;Girls Trip&quot;. Starting in 2017, Tate played Councilman Rashad Tate on &quot;Power&quot;, and continued portraying the character in sequel series &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot;.

<doc id="692661" wikidata="Q939176" url="?curid=692661" title="Carlito's Way">
<text>Carlito&#x27;s Way is a 1993 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Koepp, based on the novels &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1975) and &quot;After Hours&quot; (1979) by Judge Edwin Torres. It stars Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, Luis Guzman, John Leguizamo, Jorge Porcel, Joseph Siravo and Viggo Mortensen.

Pacino portrays Carlito Brigante, a Nuyorican criminal who vows to go straight and to retire in Paradise. However, his criminal past proves difficult to escape, and he is unwillingly dragged into the same activities that got him imprisoned in the first place. The film is based mainly on &quot;After Hours&quot;, but it used the title of the first novel to avoid it being confused with Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1985 film. This is the second film collaboration with Pacino and De Palma, after &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983).

&quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; was released on November 12, 1993, by Universal Pictures. It initially received mixed reviews from critics and lukewarm results at the box office, although general reception to the film has improved in subsequent years. The film has gained a strong cult following, and it is generally considered to be one of De Palma&#x27;s most enduring films. Both Penn and Miller received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. A prequel titled &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;, based on the first novel, was released direct-to-video in 2005.

==Plot==
In 1975 New York City, after having served five years of a thirty-year prison sentence, career criminal Carlito Brigante is freed on a legal technicality that has been exploited by his close friend and lawyer Dave Kleinfeld. Carlito vows to end his unlawful activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro to a drug deal at an illegal speakeasy. Guajiro&#x27;s suppliers betray and kill him, forcing Carlito to shoot his way out. Carlito takes Guajiro&#x27;s $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy a stake in a nightclub that is owned by a gambling addict named Saso, intending to save $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean.

Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hot-headed young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail, a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Dave develops a love interest with Benny&#x27;s girlfriend Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny&#x27;s frustration with Carlito&#x27;s rejections comes to a head, and he confronts Carlito at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Dave brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny, Carlito lets him go unharmed, a decision that alienates him from his friend and bodyguard Pachanga.

Dave, who stole $1 million in a payoff from his client, Mafia boss Anthony &quot;Tony T&quot; Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Taglialucci break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Dave begs for Carlito&#x27;s assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. That night, Carlito, Dave and Taglialucci&#x27;s son Frankie sail to a floating buoy outside of the barge where Taglialucci is waiting. As they pull Taglialucci aboard, Dave impulsively kills him and Frankie, then dumps their bodies in the East River, claiming that they would have killed him anyway. Knowing that mob retaliation is imminent, Carlito immediately severs his ties with Dave and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Dave is hospitalized after a mob hitman stabs him several times.

The police apprehend Carlito and take him to the office of District Attorney Norwalk, where he learns that Dave has already agreed to perjure himself should Carlito be tried again. Despite being threatened with charges of being an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders, Carlito refuses to betray Dave. In the hospital, Carlito visits Dave, who confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito secretly unloads Dave&#x27;s revolver and leaves. The man is Taglialucci&#x27;s other son Vinnie seeking vengeance for his brother and father. After sending away the officer who is guarding Dave, Vinnie enters Dave&#x27;s room and shoots him dead.

Carlito buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he visits his club to get the stashed money, he is met by a group of East Harlem Italian gangsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan to kill Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him through the city&#x27;s subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight.

Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who the police shoot and kill. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, Benny ambushes him and fatally shoots him several times with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to Carlito that he is now working for Benny, but the latter shoots him dead as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life. As he dies, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard comes to life in his mind, and the woman, now Gail, starts dancing.

==Cast==
* Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante (called &quot;Charlie&quot; by Gail). Pacino came to &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; directly from his Oscar-winning role in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. To get into the character, he accompanied Torres through East Harlem to absorb the sights and atmosphere. Pacino first envisioned Carlito with a ponytail, but after visiting Harlem, he quickly realized that such a hairstyle was uncommon among the local men. The beard was Pacino&#x27;s idea. The black leather coat fit into the period setting.
* Sean Penn as Dave Kleinfeld. For the pivotal role of Carlito&#x27;s sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early retirement by the challenge of playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; and work with Pacino. De Palma and Penn discussed what 1970s mob lawyers looked like. Penn shaved the hair on the front of his forehead to give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest. Alan Dershowitz, believing that Penn was attempting to look like him, threatened the filmmakers with a defamation lawsuit.
* Penelope Ann Miller as Gail. Casting for Gail proved difficult because of the character&#x27;s striptease scenes. The character needed someone who was both a talented dancer and actor.
* John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco, &quot;from the Bronx&quot;, an up-and-coming gangster who is determined to exceed Carlito&#x27;s reputation but lacks any sense of ethics.
* Luis Guzmán as Pachanga. In Koepp&#x27;s first draft of the screenplay, Pachanga spoke in a very heavy slang style. Following rumbles from the Latino cast and crew, Koepp toned this down.
* Ángel Salazar as Walberto
* Jorge Porcel as Reinaldo &quot;Ron&quot; Saso
* Al Israel as Rolando Ruiz
* Ingrid Rogers as Steffie
* James Rebhorn as District Attorney Bill Norwalk
* John Finn as Detective Duncan
* Michael P. Moran as Party Guest
* Joseph Siravo as Vincent Taglialucci
* Frank Minucci as Tony &quot;Tony T&quot; Taglialucci
* Rocco Sisto as Panama Hatman
* Adrian Pasdar as Frankie Taglialucci
* Richard Foronjy as Pete Amadesso
* Vincent Pastore as Copa Wiseguy
* Viggo Mortensen as Lalin Miasso
* John Augstin Ortiz as Guajiro
* Jaime Sánchez as Rudy

==Production==
Pacino first heard about the character Carlito Brigante in a YMCA gym in New York City in 1973. Pacino was working out for his movie &quot;Serpico&quot; when he met New York State Supreme Court Judge Edwin Torres (the author who was writing the novels &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; and &quot;After Hours&quot;). When the novels were completed, Pacino read them and liked them, especially the character of Carlito.

Inspiration for the novels came from Torres&#x27;s background: the East Harlem barrio where he was born and its atmosphere of gangs, drugs and poverty. In 1989, Pacino faced a $6 million lawsuit from producer Elliott Kastner. Kastner claimed that Pacino had reneged on an agreement to star in his version of a Carlito movie with Marlon Brando as criminal lawyer David Kleinfeld. The suit was dropped, and the project was abandoned.

Pacino went to producer Martin Bregman with the intention of getting a Carlito Brigante film made and showed him an early draft of a screenplay, which Bregman rejected. Both Bregman and Pacino agreed that the character of Brigante would provide a suitable showcase for Pacino&#x27;s talents. Bregman approached screenwriter David Koepp, who had just finished writing the script for Bregman&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;The Shadow,&quot; and asked him to write the script for &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;. The decision came that the screenplay would be based on the second novel &quot;After Hours&quot;. At this stage, Carlito would be closer to Pacino&#x27;s age. Although based primarily on the second novel, the title &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; remained, mainly because of the existence of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movie &quot;After Hours&quot;. Bregman worked closely with Koepp for two years to develop the shooting script for &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Koepp wrestled with the voice-over throughout the writing process. Initially, the voice-over was to take place in the hospital, but De Palma suggested the train station platform. The hospital scenes were written 25 to 30 times because the actors had trouble with the sequence, with Pacino thinking that Carlito would not even go to the hospital. With one final re-write, Koepp managed to make the scene work to Pacino&#x27;s satisfaction. In the novels, Kleinfeld does not die, but De Palma has a huge sense of justice and retribution. He could not have Carlito killed off and have Kleinfeld live.

At one point, &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; director John Mackenzie was linked to the film. When &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; and its sequel &quot;After Hours&quot; were optioned, Martin Bregman had Abel Ferrara in mind. However, when Bregman and Ferrara parted ways, De Palma was recruited. Bregman explained that this decision was not about &quot;getting the old team back together&quot;, but rather making use of the best talent available. De Palma reluctantly read the script, but as soon as Spanish-speaking characters became evident, he feared that it would be &quot;Scarface&quot; again. He said that he did not want to make another Spanish-speaking gangster movie.

When De Palma finally did read it all the way through, he realized that it was not what he thought it was. De Palma liked the script and envisioned it as a noir movie. Bregman supervised casting throughout the various stages of pre-production, and carefully selected the creative team who would make the film a reality. This included production designer Richard Sylbert, editor Bill Pankow, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard and director of photography Stephen Burum.

Initially, filming began on March 22, 1993, although the first scheduled shoot, the Grand Central Station climax, had to be changed when Pacino arrived on crutches. Instead, the tension-building pool-hall sequence, where Carlito accompanies his young cousin Guajiro on an ill-fated drug deal, started the production. Because the film was heavily character-based and featured little action, the early pool sequence had to be elaborate and set up right. A huge amount of time was spent setting it up and filming it. After the film studio had viewed a cut of the pool hall sequence, a note was passed onto the crew stating that they felt that the scene was too long. De Palma spent more time adding to the sequence, and made it work with the help of editor Bill Pankow.

Apart from the poster sequence, which was shot in Florida, the entire movie was filmed on location in New York. De Palma roamed Manhattan searching for suitable visual locations. A tenement on 115th Street became the site of Carlito&#x27;s homecoming: the barrio scene. The courtroom, in which Carlito thanks the prosecutor, was shot in Judge Torres&#x27;s workplace, the State Supreme Court Building at 60 Centre Street. The Club Paradise was initially in a West Side brownstone as the model for the book&#x27;s premises. However, this was considered too cramped for filming. A multi-level bistro club designed by De Palma took shape at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Long Island City, in a style of 1970s art-deco disco.

Tony Taglialucci&#x27;s escape from Rikers Island, a night shoot mid-river, was considered impossible. Instead, the production used a Brooklyn shipyard where Kleinfeld&#x27;s boat was lowered into an empty lock into which river water was pumped. Smoke machines and towers of space lights were installed.

For a climactic finale, De Palma staged a chase from the platform of the Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North) station to the escalators of Grand Central Terminal. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed for Pacino and his pursuers to dart from car to hurtling car. The length of the escalator scene during the climactic gunfight at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow. He had to piece together the sequences so that the audience would be so tied up in the action that they would not be thinking about how long the escalator was running.
==Reception==
&quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; wrapped on July 20, 1993, and was released on November 3, 1993. Critical response to the theatrical release was somewhat lukewarm. The film was criticized for re-treading old ground, mainly De Palma&#x27;s own &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; stated in his review that the film is one of De Palma&#x27;s finest, with some of the best set-pieces he has done. Patrick Doyle was praised for his scoring of the film soundtrack, which was described as &quot;elegiac&quot; and &quot;hauntingly beautiful&quot;, which &quot;displays Doyle as one of the major talents of modern film scoring&quot;.

The film has an approval rating of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; reunites De Palma and Pacino for a more wistful take on the crime epic, delivering a stylish thriller with a beating heart beneath its pyrotechnic performances and set pieces.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the film for Pacino&#x27;s &quot;Rican&quot; accent that slips into his &quot;Southern drawl from &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;&quot;, &quot;De Palma&#x27;s erratic pacing and derivative shootouts&quot; and &quot;what might have been if &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; had forged new ground and not gone down smokin&#x27; in the shadow of &quot;Scarface&quot;&quot;.

On the syndicated &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; television show, Ebert gave the film a thumbs up, while Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it a thumbs down.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film as &quot;a competent and solidly unsurprising urban-underworld thriller&quot;, and as &quot;okay entertainment&quot;, but went on to say that the plot would have worked better &quot;as a lean-and-mean &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode&quot;.

Bregman was surprised by some of the negative reviews, but stated that some of the same reviewers have since &quot;retracted&quot; their views on further discussions of the film. A few weeks before the film&#x27;s premiere, De Palma told the crew not to get their hopes up about the film&#x27;s reception. He correctly predicted that Pacino, having just won an Oscar, would be criticized; Koepp, having just done &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, would &quot;suck&quot;; Penn would be &quot;brilliant&quot; because he had not done anything for a while; and De Palma, having not been forgiven for &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, would not quite be embraced.

&quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; premiered with an opening weekend box office, taking in over $9 million. At the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed more than $37 million in the United States and Canada, and $27 million overseas, for a $64 million total. Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller both received Golden Globe nominations for their respective roles as Kleinfeld and Gail. More recent appreciation of the film was highlighted when the French publication &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; named it as one of the three best films of the 1990s, along with &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; and &quot;Goodbye South, Goodbye&quot;.

The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in fullscreen and widescreen versions. It was eventually released on DVD in 2004, with an Ultimate Edition in 2005. The Ultimate Edition DVD includes deleted scenes, an interview with De Palma, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary, and more. In 2007, an HD DVD version was released that features the same bonus material as the Ultimate Edition. The film was released on Blu-ray on May 18, 2010.

==Prequel==

A prequel based on Edwin Torres&#x27;s first novel was released direct-to-video in 2005, with the title &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;. Critically panned, the film nevertheless received Torres&#x27;s blessing as an accurate adaptation of the first novel.

<doc id="692665" wikidata="Q529443" url="?curid=692665" title="Jimmy Hart">
<text>James Ray Hart (born January 1, 1944) is an American professional wrestling manager, executive, composer, and musician. He is signed to WWE in a Legends deal. He is best known for his work in WWE when it was still known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; renamed WWE in 2002) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and used the nickname &quot;the Mouth of the South&quot; (one that was also given to Ted Turner).

Regarded by many to be one of the greatest managers in professional wrestling history, Hart has managed the likes of  Andy Kaufman, The Honky Tonk Man, Bret Hart (no relation) and Jim Neidhart (The Hart Foundation), Greg &quot;the Hammer&quot; Valentine, Jerry &quot;the King&quot; Lawler, &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase, Irwin R. Schyster, The Mountie, The Natural Disasters, Dino Bravo, the Nasty Boys, The Giant, and Hulk Hogan. He was briefly the AWA Southern Heavyweight Champion in 1981.

Before becoming involved with professional wrestling, Hart was a member of rock band The Gentrys, best known for their 1965 top five &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit, &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot;.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Memphis Wrestling (1978–1985) ===

Jimmy Hart was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He was brought into wrestling by Jerry &quot;the King&quot; Lawler, who knew of Hart because both had attended Memphis Treadwell High School. Having been asked to sing back-up with Lawler, Hart later became Lawler&#x27;s manager. After splitting from Lawler, Hart created a stable known as the First Family of Wrestling to attack Lawler, which among others included Hulk Hogan, King Kong Bundy, &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude, &quot;Leaping&quot; Lanny Poffo, Jim &quot;the Anvil&quot; Neidhart, Ox Baker, Kamala, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; Eddie Gilbert, The Iron Sheik and Kevin Sullivan.

In 1982, Hart earned national headlines doing a program with comedian and television star Andy Kaufman. Hart, Lawler and Kaufman would continue this feud for over a year. Around this time, Hart became known as &quot;the Wimp&quot;, a nickname given to him by Lawler and chanted by fans, and was the subject of the song &quot;Wimpbusters,&quot; which was sung by Lawler to the tune of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Ray Parker Jr.; a music video was also made featuring Lawler, announcer Lance Russell, and wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Jimmy Valiant, Dutch Mantel, Tommy Rich, and Rufus R. Jones, along with footage of Lawler beating Hart and his &quot;First Family&quot;. In 1981 through 1984, Hart led Austin Idol, Masao Ito, and Gilbert to NWA/AWA International titles.

===World Wrestling Federation (1985–1993)===
In 1985, Hart&#x27;s friend Hillbilly Jim recommended him to WWF owner Vince McMahon, who hired him. He was nicknamed &quot;the Mouth of the South&quot; due to his loose-lipped style, often augmented by his trademark megaphone, which he used to instruct and encourage his protégés, to discourage and annoy opponents and announcers (especially Gorilla Monsoon) and also as a weapon. Hart&#x27;s first acquisition in the WWF was Greg &quot;the Hammer&quot; Valentine, then the Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, whom Hart managed at WrestleMania. After Valentine lost the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title to Tito Santana, Hart briefly co-managed the Dream Team (Valentine and Beefcake), until he was phased out and gave full control to &quot;Luscious Johnny&quot; Valiant. At WrestleMania, Hart also managed King Kong Bundy as he defeated S.D. Jones. Hart later traded Bundy&#x27;s contract to Bobby &quot;the Brain&quot; Heenan for The Missing Link and Adrian Adonis. He helped the latter to establish his &quot;Adorable Adrian&quot; gimmick. Hart also managed Jim &quot;the Anvil&quot; Neidhart. 1985 also marked the appearance of the legendary Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart. Jimmy Hart teamed him up with Jim &quot;the Anvil&quot; Neidhart to form the Hart Foundation. On January 26, 1987, Hart guided the Hart Foundation to the WWF World Tag Team Title, which they won from the British Bulldogs. Disgraced-referee-turned-wrestler Danny Davis also was managed by Jimmy Hart.

In 1985, Hart took the Funk Family under his wing. The Funks included Terry and Hoss Funk, as well as their kayfabe brother Jimmy Jack Funk. Hart wrestled on house shows with the Funks. On July 12, 1986, Hart won a battle royal to receive $50,000 at Madison Square Garden. When The Honky Tonk Man turned heel, Hart became his manager. In this position, Hart was nicknamed &quot;the Colonel&quot; in a reference to Colonel Tom Parker, the manager of Elvis Presley. With Hart in his corner, the Honky Tonk Man captured the Intercontinental Heavyweight Title from Ricky &quot;the Dragon&quot; Steamboat on June 2, 1987, and held it until August 1988. During that time, the Honky Tonk Man feuded with Randy Savage and his manager Miss Elizabeth. &quot;The Colonel&quot; moniker stuck with him for years, even after the Honky Tonk Man departed the company in early 1991. At WrestleMania III, Hart was involved in three matches and took some incredible bumps during the show. His first appearance was with &quot;Adorable&quot; Adrian Adonis who fought Rowdy Roddy Piper. Then came the six-man tag match, pitting the Hart Foundation and Danny Davis against the Bulldogs and Tito Santana. Jimmy Hart&#x27;s third appearance on the show was when The Honky Tonk Man fought Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Roberts who had rock legend Alice Cooper in his corner. Following that match, Hart was left alone in the ring where Roberts and Cooper teamed up to terrorise him with Roberts&#x27; pet snake Damien. Also in 1987, Hart managed the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team champions Judy Martin and Leilani Kai, known as The Glamour Girls. Martin and Kai mostly feuded with Japanese team the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki).

Hart was named &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Manager of the Year in 1987, an award he won again in 1994. At WrestleMania IV, Hart received a haircut from Brutus &quot;the Barber&quot; Beefcake, after interfering in the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between Beefcake and the Honky Tonk Man, helping Honky Tonk Man retain the title by getting disqualified. When the Hart Foundation fired Hart as manager (and turned face) in 1988, Hart managed The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers to feud with his former team; the angle was that Hart still retained the managerial rights to his former team and gave a portion of it to the Rougeaus, giving them the right to appear at ringside whenever the Hart Foundation wrestled. At SummerSlam 1988, Hart accompanied Demolition and Mr. Fuji to help retain their WWF Tag Team title against the Hart Foundation. Ax used Hart&#x27;s megaphone as a foreign object to strike Bret in the head and secure the victory. In 1989, Hart brought Dino Bravo into his stable after the departure of Frenchy Martin. Then at a push-up contest between the Ultimate Warrior and Bravo, Hart and Bravo invited a large 460-pound man from the audience – later known as Earthquake – into the ring to sit on the contestants&#x27; backs. Predictably the large man was planted in the audience by Hart and Bravo and they eventually teamed up against the Warrior. In 1990, Hart groomed Earthquake to be the man to beat Hulk Hogan. Hart continued his war with his former tag team, the Hart Foundation. In 1990, he combined his protégés Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine into the short-lived team of Rhythm and Blues, though they had teamed previously as themselves when facing the Hart Foundation at WrestleMania V. In 1991, he managed The Nasty Boys to defeat the Hart Foundation for the WWF World Tag Team title at WrestleMania VII, this time using a motorbike helmet as a weapon.

When the Nasty Boys lost the title to the Legion of Doom at SummerSlam 1991, Hart sent The Natural Disasters, a team formed out of Earthquake and his former opponent Typhoon (formerly known as Tugboat), to depose the new champions. When the Disasters failed, Hart formed a new team in early 1992: Money Inc., composed of Hart&#x27;s protégé I.R.S. and &quot;the Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase. Money, Inc. defeated the L.O.D. Their title win led to the split between Hart and the Natural Disasters, who as faces feuded with Money Inc. and exchanged the tag team titles twice in 1992. Their biggest match came at WrestleMania VIII when Money Inc. retained their titles by leaving the ring and forcing a count-out. In 1991, Hart had also brought in The Mountie, who had a short reign as Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion in early 1992 after defeating Bret Hart on January 17, then losing it just two days later to Rowdy Roddy Piper at the Royal Rumble. A few months earlier, The Mountie feuded with the Big Boss Man over who was the &quot;law and order&quot; in the WWF. Their feud culminated in a match at SummerSlam where the loser (in this case The Mountie) had to spend the night in a New York jail. Late in 1992, Money Inc. regaining the tag team titles from the Natural Disasters led to the Nasty Boys turning on their manager, as he had repeatedly substituted them for Money Inc. in title matches.

Hart broke with Money Inc. early in 1993 and turned face when the team attacked Brutus &quot;the Barber&quot; Beefcake. In the storyline, Hart, conscious of Beefcake&#x27;s extensive facial injuries from a real-life parasailing accident three years prior which required extensive re-constructive surgery to Beefcake&#x27;s face and all but ended his full-time career, felt that his team went too far, and tried to stop them. Hart even went so far as to cover an unconscious Beefcake with his own body to stop them from doing more harm. Beefcake&#x27;s long time friend Hulk Hogan came out the following week and expressed gratitude to Hart for his uncharacteristically heroic actions. He managed both Beefcake and Hogan who at WrestleMania IX lost to Money Inc by disqualification. Later in the show, Hart for the first time would be the manager of the WWF World Heavyweight Champion when Hogan accepted an impromptu challenge by Mr. Fuji, the manager of the new champion Yokozuna who had just defeated Bret Hart for the belt. Hogan would defeat the new champion in a short match. At King of the Ring, Hart was in Hogan&#x27;s corner as he lost the WWF World Heavyweight Title back to Yokozuna. This appearance was Hart&#x27;s last in the WWF, as he, Beefcake and Hogan all departed the company.

===World Championship Wrestling (1994–2001)===

Following their departure from the WWF, Hogan and Hart briefly toured Mexico. After their return, Hart wrote music and occasionally appeared on Hogan&#x27;s television show, &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;. Hogan then had Hart manage him when they went to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). At Bash at the Beach in 1994, Hart managed Hogan to win his first WCW World Heavyweight Title by defeating &quot;the Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair.

At Halloween Havoc in 1995, Hart turned on Hogan to help The Giant. Hart also became the manager of the evil faction, the Dungeon of Doom, created by Kevin Sullivan. During that era, he managed Ric Flair to a 12th world title victory over Macho Man Randy Savage at Starrcade &#x27;95. After the demise of the Dungeon of Doom in July 1997, Hart was written off television for a few months and then Hart returned in November 1997 to only manage The Faces of Fear, then in 1998, Hart recreated The First Family. After the demise of the First Family, Hart was placed in charge of booking TBS&#x27;s &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; show prior to the program&#x27;s cancellation. Hart wrestled on April 18, 1999, to defeat Bubba the Love Sponge by disqualification at a house show. On November 15, he wrestled WCW Monday Nitro losing to Norman Smiley in a Hardcore match. Jimmy Hart was also the first Strapmaster for the Yapapi Indian strap match in which Hulk Hogan defeated Ric Flair on March 19, 2000, at the Uncensored PPV. At Spring Stampede in 2000, Hart faced radio personality Mancow. The two had a rematch later in the year at Mayhem. In February 2001, Hart joined WCW&#x27;s booking committee.

===Independent circuit; Wrestlicious (2002–present)===

After the sale of WCW to the then rival WWF, Hart and a close consortium of wrestlers and investors decided to create a wrestling organization—the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF)—that would replace WCW as well as take wrestling back to early 1990s style of fun, family-oriented entertainment with minimal story lines and more solid wrestling. In 2002, Hart restarted his feud with Jerry Lawler by buying, for the XWF, part of the upstart Memphis Wrestling promotion. Hart would wrestle for Memphis Wrestling from 2003 to 2005. He lost to Jimmy Valiant in a Loser Eats Dog Food match on August 2, 2003. In 2007, Hart appeared at the PMG Clash of Legends. On November 7, 2008, Hart appeared at the Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler 35th anniversary event. He also made a few appearances with Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE&#x27;s developmental territory, as a color commentator in 2008. He made multiple appearances for WrestleMania Axxess during the week leading up to The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania.

In May 2006, Hart traveled to The Funking Conservatory, owned by Dory Funk Jr and Marti Funk, to shoot promos with the students. His most notable ones being with Studio Sar Ah when he discusses his move from World Wrestling Entertainment to TNA Wrestling and as well as Wrestlicious. Both promos can be found on the Studio Sar Ah fan page on Facebook and as well as YouTube. Hart continues to work at the school and shoot promos. On January 19, 2010, Hart announced that his all-female wrestling promotion Wrestlicious would be premiering on MavTV and BiteTV on March 1, 2010. He wrestled at Pro Wrestling Guerrilla&#x27;s Kurt RussellReunion II: The Reunioning in a battle royal won by Roddy Piper. On January 12, 2012, he wrestled at PWS WrestleReunion VI in battle royal won by The Godfather. Hart currently appears at various professional wrestling conventions and autograph signings around the United States. He is a staple at all of the Wrestlereunion shows, and also does various appearances as part of the VOC Nation wrestling radio program in Philadelphia on 1360 WNJC. Hart is a regular guest on the VOC Wrestling Nation radio program on WNJC.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2011)===
In October 2003 Hart made his debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), hyping a match between Hulk Hogan and Jeff Jarrett, which was eventually scrapped as Hogan decided to return to WWE instead. On June 19, 2005, at Slammiversary pay-per-view, The Naturals were assisted in a title defense against Team Canada by Hart, who ran to ringside and threw his megaphone to Chase Stevens, who hit Petey Williams with it and pinned him. Hart acted as the manager of The Naturals until October 3, 2005. On February 14, 2010, at Against All Odds, Hart made his return to TNA as a heel by helping The Nasty Boys defeat Team 3D in a tag team match. The alliance, however, was short-lived, as on March 29, 2010, news broke that the Nasty Boys had been released by TNA following an incident at a TNA function with Spike executives present. Hart stayed with the company following the incident, but his role was unknown. Hart was seen on the January 20, 2011, edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when Kurt Angle yelled at him to play his entrance music upon entering the Impact! Zone.

===Return to WWE (2011–present)===

On March 1, 2011, it was reported that Jimmy Hart had left Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and re-signed with WWE to work on WrestleMania-related projects. Hart has since hosted various house shows. On August 14, 2011, Hart made an appearance at SummerSlam, teasing a managerial position with R-Truth during a backstage segment. On April 10, 2012, Hart made an appearance on SmackDown: Blast from the Past, where he managed the team of Heath Slater and Tyson Kidd, but ended up getting the mandible claw from Mick Foley.

As of April 30, 2014, Hart was part-owner of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Beach&quot;, a wrestling-themed tiki-bar in Tampa, Florida. As of April 2014, Hart was a regular cast member on the WWE Network original reality show Legends&#x27; House.
Hart appeared on the August 11 edition of Raw for Hogan&#x27;s birthday celebration.
In April 2017, Hart purchased a beachfront property in Daytona Beach, Florida, and opened “Jimmy Hart’s Hall of Fame Bar and Tiki Deck“, which is a beach bar featuring an abundance of autographed pictures, wrestling paraphernalia, and at times an intercontinental championship belt.
On January 4, 2021, he made an appearance on the RAW Legends Night where he was involved in a segment with Hulk Hogan, Drew McIntyre and Sheamus.

On January 23, 2023, Hart appeared on WWE Raw is XXX, the 30th anniversary edition of Monday Night Raw, accompanying Hulk Hogan to open the show. On January 6, 2025, Hart once again accompanied Hogan during the Raw debut on Netflix.

===Music===

Before wrestling, Hart, as a teenager, was a vocalist in the 60s band The Gentrys, who had a million selling record with 1965&#x27;s &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot;. Before becoming The Gentrys, they were known as just &quot;The Gents.&quot; Their production manager told them that if they did not change their name, then they would not succeed in the music industry. Later, after the leader of the group Larry Raspberry left, Hart took over and they had a few minor hits, most notably &quot;Why Should I Cry&quot; and a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, but were never able to match the success of &quot;Keep on Dancing.&quot; Hart and the band were successful in the Memphis area nightclub circuit. The group was under contract to Stax Records at the time of its bankruptcy, and Stax could not properly promote them.

During his years in the professional wrestling business, Hart composed many theme songs for wrestlers in the WWF and WCW. Some of the wrestlers for whom he composed music were Honky Tonk Man, Jimmy Snuka, Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake, The Rockers, The Hart Foundation, Crush, the Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, Dusty Rhodes, the Legion of Doom, the Nasty Boys, Ted DiBiase, the Mountie, Hulk Hogan, Sting, the nWo Wolfpac, and 3 Count. He also composed the themes for &quot;SummerSlam &#x27;88&quot; (which was later reused as the theme for many early &quot;Royal Rumble&quot; events) and &quot;WrestleMania VI&quot; (which was later used for the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth events). One of Hart&#x27;s most notable compositions is Shawn Michaels&#x27;s entrance theme, &quot;Sexy Boy.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Hart released a music album (also available on cassette tape) titled &quot;Outrageous Conduct&quot;. The release consisted of comical songs done in character, such as &quot;Barbra Streisand&#x27;s Nose&quot; and &quot;Eat Your Heart Out Rick Springfield&quot; (the latter of which would become Hart&#x27;s solo theme song in WWE). In 1995, Hulk Hogan released the album &quot;Hulk Rules, on Select Records.&quot; Hart, as well as Hogan&#x27;s wife Brian Knobbs, were a part of the band The Wrestling Boot Band and helped write and sing many of the album&#x27;s songs.

===Television appearances===
In September 2007, Hart appeared on an episode of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; as a witness for a defendant. Hart is a close friend of Hulk Hogan and is featured on many episodes of Hogan&#x27;s VH1 reality series, &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. Hart was also a judge on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;. Hart also appears in hair restoration advertisements for Medical Hair Restoration, as a client. He also does a comedic women&#x27;s wrestling show called Wrestlicious, which can be viewed at Wrestlicious.com. Hart appeared on the WWE Legends&#x27; House. Hart has appeared a few times in Hulk Hogan&#x27;s TV-show Thunder in Paradise. He also sang the intro music for the episode &quot;Deadly Lessons, Pt. 1&quot;.

<text>Louis Étienne Ernest Reyer (1 December 1823 – 15 January 1909) was a French opera composer and music critic.

== Biography ==
Ernest Reyer was born in Marseille. His father, a notary, did not want his son to take up a career in music. However, he did not actively block his son&#x27;s ambitions and allowed him to attend classes at the Conservatoire from age six to sixteen. In 1839, when he was 16 years old, Ernest traveled to north Africa to work under his brother-in-law, head of accounting for the Treasury Department in Algeria. The job was not a good fit with Reyer&#x27;s nonchalant and undisciplined temperament. From administrative documents, it is apparent that Reyer wrote innumerable youthful essays and stories, and original dance pieces. Some of his early compositions achieved local notoriety and received favorable comments in the Algerian press, including a Mass performed at the cathedral that was performed for the arrival of the Duke of Aumale in 1847.

Reyer returned to Paris during the events 1848. During this period, he was introduced to various eminent artists, including Gustave Flaubert and Théophile Gautier. Southern France and Provence held its allure, and Reyer returned there to socialize with local people with whom he loved to play dominoes while smoking a pipe. He said that his pipe was his best source of inspiration.

His aunt, Louise Farrenc, professor of piano at the Conservatoire and a talented composer in her own right, directed Reyer&#x27;s early musical studies. In 1850, he composed a symphonic ode entitled &quot;Le Sélam&quot; for soloists and chorus to words by Gautier. Four years later, in 1854, he composed music for an opera in one act, &quot;Maître Wolfram&quot; (&quot;Master Wolfram&quot;), whose libretto was by Joseph Méry. Hearing a performance of this work at the Opéra Comique, Berlioz recognized Reyer&#x27;s talent. He said that Reyer&#x27;s output had &quot;nothing in common with the somewhat affected, somewhat dilapidated approach the Paris muse [...]. His melodies are natural [...]. There&#x27;s heart and imagination there.&quot;

Gradually, some fame came Reyer&#x27;s way. In 1857, the critic Charles Monselet wrote: &quot;Is this a musician who writes, or a writer who makes music? I do not know, but I am hopeful that this spirited boy will make his way to singing and writing.&quot; Admittedly, Reyer was not (yet) unanimously praised and some critics pointed-out that his orchestration had not achieved a level of musical genius.

The following year he composed a ballet, &quot;Sacountalâ&quot;, with a story, once again, by Gautier, the plot of which was based on Kālidāsa&#x27;s &quot;Shakuntala&quot;. The ballet was given twenty-four performances through to 1860.

In 1861, Reyer composed an &quot;opéra-comique&quot; in three acts and six scenes, &quot;La statue&quot; (&quot;The Statue&quot;), whose plot was inspired by &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (also knowns as: &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) with a libretto by Michel Carré and Jules Barbier. It was premiered in Théâtre Lyrique in Paris on April 11, 1861. In less than two years, &quot;La statue&quot; achieved sixty performances, an impressive figure for the period.

Reyer&#x27;s work was finally universally recognized in 1862, and the composer from Marseilles became a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. The same year, he composed &quot;Érostrate&quot;, an opera in two acts, which was played in August 1862 in Baden-Baden, under the auspices of great families in Europe, which earned him the distinction of receiving the Red Eagle from the hands of the Queen of Prussia.

Little by little, however, his reputation began to decline. The same &quot;Érostate&quot; failed completely in Paris and was staged for only three performances, which deprived the work of a possible production at the Opéra.
The best-known of his five operas is &quot;Sigurd&quot; (1884); it was quite popular in France during its initial production there (it had its premiere in Brussels at the Théâtre de La Monnaie in January 1884), and is sometimes (although rarely) revived. &quot;Sigurd&quot; is based on the Scandinavian legends of the Edda Völsunga saga (&quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;), the same source which Richard Wagner drew upon for the libretto for his Ring cycle. The music of &quot;Sigurd&quot;, however, is quite unlike the music of Wagner. While Reyer admired Wagner, he developed his music more along the lines of his mentor, Hector Berlioz. Listening to &quot;Sigurd&quot;, one cannot help but hear echoes of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; or &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, imbued with the same heroic musical posture.

Reyer&#x27;s last opera was &quot;Salammbô&quot; (1890), based on the novel by Gustave Flaubert, which achieved 46 performances from May to December 1892. The work had been composed several years earlier but had been met with initial resistance by administrators, as had &quot;Sigurd&quot;. It was first performed at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1890, and at the Théâtre des Arts in Rouen.

Unable to live on the proceeds from his operas, Reyer succeeded Berlioz as music critic at the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;. He also worked as the librarian at the Académie de musique.

Reyer died in Le Lavandou, in the south of France, ~80 km east of Marseilles.

<text>Dead Presidents is a 1995 American crime film co-written, produced and directed by the Hughes Brothers. The film chronicles the life of Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), focusing on his teenage years as a high school graduate and his experiences during the Vietnam War as a Recon Marine. As he returns to his hometown in The Bronx, Curtis finds himself struggling to support himself and his family, eventually turning to a life of crime.

&quot;Dead Presidents&quot; is based partly on the real-life experiences of Haywood T. Kirkland (aka Ari S. Merretazon), whose true story was detailed in the book &quot;Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans &quot; by Wallace Terry. Certain characters from the film are based on real acquaintances of Kirkland, who served time in prison after committing robbery in facepaint. The film also is loosely based on several incidents involving the Black Liberation Army, notably the Brink&#x27;s armored truck robbery.

== Plot ==
In 1968, Anthony Curtis, a soon-to-be high school graduate in The Bronx, chooses to enlist in the United States Marine Corps rather than go to college. He deploys to Vietnam, leaving behind his middle-class family, his girlfriend Juanita, and small-time crook Kirby, who is like a second father. Anthony&#x27;s close friend, Skip, later joins Curtis&#x27; Recon squad after dropping out of Hunter College. His other friend, Jose, is drafted into the United States Army. Once in Vietnam, Curtis and his squad lose several fellow Marines during combat, and commit several atrocities of their own, such as executing enemy prisoners and beheading Viet Cong corpses for war trophies.

When Anthony returns to the Bronx in 1973, he finds returning to &quot;normal&quot; life impossible. Skip is now an Agent Orange victim and heroin addict; Jose, forced to wear a prosthetic hand, is a pyromaniac who works as a postman at the James A. Farley Building, and Cleon, the squad&#x27;s religious but homicidal staff sergeant, is now a devoted minister in Mount Vernon.

After being laid off from his job at a butcher shop, on the verge of alcoholism, and suffering from heavily induced PTSD nightmares, Anthony finds himself unable to support Juanita (who is having an affair with a pimp) or his infant daughter. After an argument with Juanita, Anthony meets her sister, Delilah, who is now a member of the &quot;Nat Turner Cadre&quot;, a militant Black power Marxist group. Anthony, Kirby, Skip, Jose, Delilah and Cleon devise a plan to rob an armored car making a stop at the Noble Street Federal Reserve Bank.

The next day, the group strategically position themselves around the street, armed with weapons and disguised with face paint, ready to ambush the truck. The plan goes awry when Cleon is approached by a New York Police Department (NYPD) officer who unknowingly stumbles upon the robbery, leading to Kirby being shot in the arm and Skip killing the officer. At the same time, Anthony and Jose are spotted by the truck&#x27;s driver, causing a shootout with the security guards.

Jose plants an explosive device on the escaping truck to blow off the door, but instead it destroys the entire vehicle. Delilah saves Anthony&#x27;s life by killing one of the guards. A second guard appears and shoots Delilah multiple times, killing her. As the group collects what cash they can from the burning wreckage, they flee and split up to escape the police. Jose gets cornered in an alley by an approaching police car. When he shoots the officer, he is hit by the car and killed as the car crashes into a wall.

Not long after the heist, Kirby hears that Cleon has been giving out $100 bills and purchased a new Cadillac. Anthony drives over to Cleon&#x27;s church to speak to him, only to find him being led out the front door in handcuffs by two detectives. Cleon gives up the other robbers as part of a remorseful plea bargain. NYPD officers storm Skip&#x27;s apartment to arrest him, only to find that he has died of a heroin overdose. As Kirby and Anthony prepare to flee to Mexico, police raid the bar. Kirby tries to distract the officers to allow Anthony to flee, but it is to no avail, as multiple officers corner Anthony and arrest him.

In court, Anthony&#x27;s lawyer pleads for a fair sentence, noting that he served his country in the Marines and earned a Silver Star. Anthony also pleas for leniency, expressing remorse for the deaths of those involved, and that he did what he did out of desperation and hardship. However the judge, a Marine and Battle of Guadalcanal veteran, proclaims that Anthony has forgotten his values and shouldn&#x27;t use the Vietnam War as an excuse for his actions, sentencing him to fifteen years to life. Anthony, furious at his sentence, throws a chair at the judge before being escorted away by bailiffs. The final scene shows Anthony looking out the window of his prison bus.

== Cast ==
== Themes ==
The film depicts the struggle of returning war veterans of color who are neglected by the US government and the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans. Many black and Latino veterans of the Vietnam War were denied benefits, compensation, and recognition for their efforts in serving their country.

== Production ==
Principal photography commenced on October 31, 1994. The production filmed through the remainder of the year and into early February across a variety of locations, including location shoots Brooklyn and Mount Vernon, New York. Sound stages in Queens and Los Angeles served as interior locations. All Vietnam scenes were shot in Florida, with former celery farm Lee Ranch serving as the outdoor sets.

== Reception ==
&quot;Dead Presidents&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 35 reviews with an average score of 5.8/10.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review stating, &quot;In all respects an extremely ambitious follow-up to their crackling debut, &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, the Hughes Brothers&#x27; mordant &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; may eventually box itself into a narrative dead end, but its muscular engagement of weighty themes and explosive situations makes it a powerful drama.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;both expected and surprising, familiar and yet somehow different. Made with fluid skill and a passion for storytelling, its tale of how the Vietnam War and American society affect a black Marine remains accessible while confounding expectations.&quot;

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the film &quot;takes on much more than it can handle.&quot; Comparing the film with the Hughes Brother&#x27;s previous film James said, &quot;The Hugheses obviously knew the world and generation of &quot;Menace II Society&quot; better than the past of &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, but that is only part of the problem. In &quot;Menace&quot; they trusted the audience more, immersing them in a violent world the film explained without condoning.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a mixed 2.5 star review, and explained that the directing duo &quot;have a sure sense of the camera, of actors, of the life within a scene. But they are not as sure when it comes to story and meaning, and here is a film that feels incomplete, as if its last step is into thin air. Scene by scene you feel its skill, but you leave the theater wondering about the meaning of it all.&quot; The early scenes were the best, according to Ebert, and the film &quot;goes off the rails&quot; in the final act.

Mark Kermode placed it at number two in his countdown of top five underrated films of all time.

<doc id="692672" wikidata="Q7547340" url="?curid=692672" title="Snapple">
<text>Snapple is a brand of tea and juice drinks which is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, based in Plano, Texas, United States. The original producer of Snapple, a company that was known as Unadulterated Food Products, was founded in 1972. The brand achieved some fame due to various pop-culture references, including television shows.

==History==
Snapple was founded by Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden, and Arnold Greenberg in 1972 in Valley Stream, Long Island, New York. Their company, which was originally known as Unadulterated Food Products, was first conceived as a part-time venture to supply fruit juices to health food stores. Unsure if the business would succeed, Greenberg continued to run his health food store in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village, while Leonard Marsh and his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, operated a window washing business. In a 1989 interview with &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business&quot;, Marsh admitted that when they launched the small business he knew &quot;as much about juice as about making an atom bomb.&quot;

An early apple juice product led to the company&#x27;s name, Snapple. Golden, Greenberg and Marsh had created a carbonated apple juice. One of the batches of apple juice fermented in the bottle, causing the bottle caps to fly off. The original name of that particular apple juice product, &quot;Snapple&quot;, a portmanteau derived from the words &quot;snappy&quot; and &quot;apple&quot;, became the new name for their beverage company. Thus the Snapple Beverage Corporation was born, beginning in the early 1980s. Snapple would not manufacture their first tea, lemon tea, until 1987.

, there are many different types of Snapple: tea (multiple flavors, such as lemon, raspberry, and peach, all of which come in original and diet), juice drinks, lemonade, and bottled water. Snapple also comes in aluminum cans.

Snapple&#x27;s brand slogan is &quot;Made from the Best Stuff on Earth&quot;.

Snapple was known for a popular series of TV advertisements in the early 1990s featuring Wendy Kaufman (the &quot;Snapple Lady&quot;) answering letters from Snapple fans. In an effort to counteract the Coke and Pepsi challenge commercials, Snapple began running a new line of advertisements in May 1992, which featured its trademark &quot;Made from the best stuff on Earth&quot; line in ads that spoofed earlier beer and sports drinks promotions; the ads received low marks from advertising industry observers. In addition, the company used its $15-million-a-year advertising budget to pay for a long-lived series of live radio commercials featuring controversial radio hosts Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. At the end of the summer of 1992, Snapple conducted a five-week search for a new advertising agency that could better convey its corporate identity in preparation for a wider national push. Later that year, Snapple also signed tennis player Jennifer Capriati to endorse its products. By August 1992, Snapple had expanded its distribution to every major city in the United States and it signed new contracts with beverage distributors. The company owned no manufacturing facilities, but instead made agreements with more than 30 bottlers across the country. In this way, Snapple was able to keep its overhead low and its payroll short. The company administration consisted of just 80 employees, 50 of whom worked out of a modest office building on Long Island.

Thomas H. Lee, an American businessperson, financier and investor of Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL), acquired Snapple Beverages in 1992 on undisclosed terms. The three founders of Snapple, Leonard Marsh, Hyman Golden and Arnold Greenberg, said they would own about one-third of the new company and be involved in its management. Hellen Berry, vice president of the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a consultant in New York, estimated that Snapple, which had been for sale for more than a year and had $100 million in sales in 1991, sold for $140 million. Only eight months after buying the company, Lee took Snapple Beverages public and in 1994, only two years after the original acquisition, Lee sold the company to the Quaker Oats Company for $1.7 billion. Lee was estimated to have made $900 million for himself and his investors from the sale. Quaker Oats ran into problems and sold Snapple to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. Snapple was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners.
== Controversies ==

===Lawsuits===
In 2009, a consumer lawsuit was brought against Snapple in California. The suit alleged the drinks contained unhealthy ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup and deceptive names on labels that led consumers to believe that certain healthy elements are in the drinks that are not really present.

In 2010, in a lawsuit against Snapple in the federal District of New Jersey, the court certified to the FDA for an administrative determination the question whether high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) qualifies as a &quot;natural&quot; ingredient. In 2010, the FDA responded by letter and declined to provide the court with the requested guidance. Stating that it would take two to three years to engage in a transparent proceeding to elicit the proper public participation, the FDA again cited its limited resources and more pressing food-safety concerns.

In 2011, a New York federal court dismissed a different lawsuit accusing Snapple of misleading consumers by labeling drinks sweetened with high fructose corn syrup as &quot;all natural&quot; when the drink contained no natural juice. The court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they were injured as a result of Snapple&#x27;s labeling.

After the lawsuit in May 2009, Snapple was made with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. In certain areas the older formula is still sold in stores, but this is becoming increasingly rare.

=== Snapple and New York City schools ===
In October 2003, Snapple began its sponsorship of the New York City public school system (and other parcels in the area), as part of the deal to make Snapple New York City&#x27;s official beverage. The company promised an $8 million per year profit for city schools if it were allowed to sell its drinks, including juice and bottled water, in school vending machines.

Snapple was able to acquire the contract in part because New York City officials did not want to encourage the consumption of sodas, which have been linked to childhood obesity and diabetes and are generally considered unhealthy. The Snapple juice drinks, specifically created to meet rules banning soda and other sugary snacks from city schools, are marketed under the &quot;Snapple 100% Juiced!&quot; label. The flavors available under this brand include Green Apple, Fruit Punch, Melon Berry, Grape, Orange Mango, and Strawberry Lime. Although the juice drinks are fortified with vitamins and minerals, a 16-ounce bottle contains more sugar (41 grams) than a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola (39 grams).

Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, called the drinks &quot;little better than vitamin-fortified sugar water.&quot; In addition, the concentrates used in the drinks, apple, grape and pear, are the least expensive and nutritious. Dr. Toni Liquori, associate professor at the Columbia Teachers College, questioned the sale of bottled water in schools, saying &quot;If anything, we should have cold water in our schools.&quot;

The deal also gave Snapple exclusive rights to sell its tea and juice-based drinks in vending machines on all New York City properties starting in January 2004. Snapple paid the City $106 million for the rights and agreed to spend $60 million more to marketing and promotion over the length of the five-year contract.

=== K symbol ===
In the early 1990s, the original label graphic on the Iced Tea flavor, a depiction of the United States historical event the Boston Tea Party, was replaced due to misinformation espoused by protest groups claiming the ships on the packaging were slave trading vessels in New York Harbor. Snapple also fell victim to a rumor that the small &quot;K&quot; was either a representation of the Klan, or of an imagined Jewish Tax (augmented by the fact that all three founders were Jewish). The &quot;K&quot; on the products actually meant that they were certified kosher. There were also rumors that the company donated to the controversial pro-life organization Operation Rescue.

Snapple initially tried to quell these rumors quietly, but ultimately had to launch a media campaign to squash them, pointing out it would be bad for business to support controversial issues in such a way as the rumors implied. Through a media campaign with the NAACP, Snapple successfully fought back these rumors, although occasionally they are still brought up as fact.

==Real Facts==
Snapple is well known for printing an interesting numbered list of Snapple &quot;Real Fact&quot; facts on the inside of their bottle caps. A list of these &quot;Real Facts&quot; is available on the company website; however, the most comprehensive list of &quot;Real Facts&quot; is available at https://www.snapplecaps.com/real-facts/. The &quot;Real Facts&quot; currently go from #1 to at least #1953, although many numbers in this range have never had facts written for them and have never been put into circulation.

Several of the facts on Snapple caps have been found to be outdated, incorrect or exaggerated.

==Popular culture==

Snapple was the official beverage sponsor of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; from season 7 to season 9 of the NBC show (Howard Stern, one of the judges on the show, was a spokesperson for Snapple in the 1980s). It was replaced by Dunkin&#x27; for season 10.

==Snapple Theater Center==
In 2007, Snapple opened the Snapple Theater Center on 50th Street and Broadway in the heart of New York City&#x27;s Theater District. It has two theaters, one of which is a traditional theater, the other a thrust stage which can house plays. The center also includes a 40×50 ft rehearsal space which is available for rent. The theaters are considered off-Broadway because of their low seating capacities. The theater has since dropped the Snapple name and sponsorship and is simply known as &quot;The Theater Center&quot;.

==Kosher certification==
Most Snapple drinks do have a Kosher certification from the OK Kosher Agency. Exceptions include:
* Fruit Punch
* Grape
* Kiwi Lemon-lime
