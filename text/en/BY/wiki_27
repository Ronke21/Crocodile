<text>&quot;Blue Monday&quot; is a song by the English rock band New Order. It was released as a 12-inch single on 7 March 1983 through Factory Records. It appears on certain cassette and CD versions of New Order&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; (1983). The track was written and produced by Gillian Gilbert, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner.

&quot;Blue Monday&quot; is a eurodisco, synth-pop and alternative dance song that drew inspirations from many works of other artists. The 12-inch single was backed with a primarily instrumental version of the song entitled &quot;The Beach&quot; on the B-side. The single&#x27;s unique packaging was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens. It features a die-cut sleeve designed to resemble a -inch floppy disk. The cover features no words, but instead has code, invented by Saville, in the form of coloured blocks that contains the artist, song and label information.

The original single made the top 10 in many countries. It reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and spent 38 weeks in the top 75. It spent 186 weeks on the UK Independent Singles Chart, effectively selling for four years until the release of the &quot;Substance 1987&quot; compilation on which it featured. The UK Indie Chart run was second only to &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division, which clocked 195 weeks (their runs overlapped). In New Zealand, it peaked at number 2 and spent 74 weeks (spread across three calendar years) in the top 50. The 1988 remix reached number 3 on the British chart and number 4 on the Australian chart, and it topped the dance chart in the United States.

&quot;Blue Monday&quot; is the best-selling 12-inch single of all time. In the United Kingdom, it has sold 1.16 million copies in all formats, including the 1988 and 1995 re-releases. Sales of the original 1983 12-inch release account for the bulk of the total, at over 700,000 copies. It was remixed by the band twice, in 1988 and 1995. The 1988 remix reached number 1 in New Zealand and the top 10 in other countries. The song has been covered by bands including Orgy, Flunk, 808 State, the Enemy and Health. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 235 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.
== Background and writing ==
New Order was formed in 1980 by the former members of Joy Division, which split after the death of their singer, Ian Curtis. They later recruited Gillian Gilbert as keyboardist and second guitarist, and began to explore new musical technology such as synthesisers.

New Order wrote &quot;Blue Monday&quot; in their rehearsal room in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. It started as a response to their audience&#x27;s disappointment that they never played encores. It would allow the band to return to the stage, press a button and the track would play by itself as an encore while the band was off stage. The band however found it difficult to synchronize all the elements properly and improvising on the drafts it evolved into a song.

The synth bassline was performed on a Moog Source and sequenced on a sequencer built by the singer, Bernard Sumner. An Oberheim DMX drum machine was used for rhythm. The kick drum was recorded playing through a studio monitor to capture the room&#x27;s natural reverb. New Order bought an early sampler, the Emulator 1, and sampled choir sounds from Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot;. Sumner and the drummer, Stephen Morris, learnt how to use the sampler by spending hours recording their flatulence.

New Order worked before the advent of MIDI, and so enlisted the engineer Martin Usher to design a circuit to synchronise the synthesisers and drum machine. Usher introduced them to the DMX drum machine, which had outputs that could be sent to the other instruments. The sequence was programmed using binary code. Gilbert wrote the sequence out by hand on a long roll of paper, and accidentally added an extra rest, throwing the sequence slightly out of time; the band liked the effect and kept it in the song. New Order also reused some elements from their 1982 composition &quot;Video 5 8 6&quot;.

The bassist, Peter Hook, cited Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Sparks as influences, and said the song was &quot;stolen&quot; from the Donna Summer song &quot;Our Love&quot;. Sumner said parts were taken from &quot;Dirty Talk&quot; by Klein + MBO and &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; by Sylvester. Gilbert said Hook&#x27;s bassline came from a film soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, a theme from &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965).

==Composition==

&quot;Blue Monday&quot; has been labelled a &quot;synth-pop classic&quot; and described as cementing the group&#x27;s movement from post-punk to alternative dance. It has been noted as an example of the hi-NRG style of club music, and the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; called it &quot;the ultimate in flawlessly programmed, LSD-driven, push-button dance-pop&quot;.

The song begins with a semiquaver kick drum, followed by a sequenced melody. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; does not feature a standard verse-chorus structure. After a lengthy introduction, the first and second verses are contiguous and are separated from the third verse only by a brief series of sound effects. A short breakdown follows the third verse, which leads to an extended outro.

&quot;Blue Monday&quot; was described by the BBC Radio 2 &quot;Sold on Song&quot; feature as &quot;a crucial link between Seventies disco and the dance/house boom that took off at the end of the Eighties.&quot; Synth-pop had been a major force in British popular music for several years, but &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, with encouragement by the band&#x27;s manager Rob Gretton, was a dance record that also exhibited influences from the New York club scene.

==Packaging==
The 1983 edition artwork is designed to resemble a inch floppy disk. The sleeve does not display either the group name or song title in plain English anywhere; the only text on the sleeve is &quot;FAC SEVENTY THREE&quot; on the spine. Instead the legend &quot;FAC 73 BLUE MONDAY AND THE BEACH NEW ORDER&quot; is represented in code by a series of coloured blocks. The key enabling this to be deciphered was printed on the back sleeve of the album, &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; are two of four Factory releases from this time period to employ the colour code, the others being &quot;Confusion&quot; by New Order and &quot;From the Hip&quot; by Section 25.

The single&#x27;s original sleeve, created by Factory designer Peter Saville and Brett Wickens, was die-cut with a silver inner sleeve. It cost so much to produce that Factory Records actually lost money on each copy sold. Matthew Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot; notes that &quot;[d]ue to the use of die-cutting and specified colours, the production cost of this sleeve was so high that the single sold at a loss.&quot; Tony Wilson noted that it lost 5p per sleeve &quot;due to our strange accounting system&quot;; Saville noted that nobody expected &quot;Blue Monday&quot; to be a commercially successful record at all, so nobody expected the cost to be an issue.&quot; In &quot;Shadowplayers: The Rise and Fall of Factory Records&quot;, Saville states &quot;I am so bored with this story. We didn&#x27;t even know how many of these expensive covers were ever made anyway.&quot;

Robertson also noted that &quot;later reissues had subtle changes to limit the cost&quot; (the diecut areas being replaced with printed silver ink). Saville commented in 2013 that the printers &quot;banged out a cheaper version. I don&#x27;t know how many thousands were sold [the original] way, or whether Factory were charged the full price for something they didn&#x27;t get, which would be very Factory.&quot; Peter Saville Associates charged Factory £538.20 for the sleeve design. The artwork was so late that Saville sent it straight to the printer, unreviewed by either the band or the label. The 1988 and 1995 versions were packaged in conventional sleeves.

==Music videos==
A music video for a shortened version of the original was created in 1983, featuring military clips with false colour, simple computer-generated graphics such as colour blocks and geometric lines, digitised video of band members at very low resolution and framerate, a brief amount of footage taken from the 1977 film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, and a short appearance of the 1982 video game &quot;Zaxxon&quot;. The colour blocks were created using Peter Saville&#x27;s colour-coded alphabet.

The music video for &quot;Blue Monday &#x27;88&quot; appears on the &quot;Substance&quot; video collection (released as a companion to the album of the same name). The video features sketches by photographer William Wegman and his Weimaraner dog named Fay Ray doing balancing acts intercut with hand-drawn animation by Robert Breer. The band members are shown standing around doing various tasks, such as walking a wooden plank over a floor that is painted blue, holding wire-mesh constructed art and milk crates over their faces, being hit by tennis balls, and standing still while they flip through various flip books (tying into the hand-drawn animation sequences).

In September 2012, New Order headlined a festival at Portmeirion in North Wales and festival organisers recruited the support of the local Brythoniaid Male Voice Choir to produce a cover version and accompanying video.

==Legacy and influence==
In the decades since its release, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; has been commonly cited as one of the greatest songs of all time. In 2022, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was included in the list &quot;The story of &quot;NME&quot; in 70 (mostly) seminal songs&quot;, at number 21. Mark Beaumont wrote that with this song, &quot;Britain&#x27;s formative alternative dance culture found its way&quot; in the mainstream and &quot;stayed there until the acid house explosion obliterated clubland&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 235 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

Following its release, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; influenced hi-NRG-producer Bobby Orlando, the Detroit techno scene and the synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys. In 2002 Kylie Minogue performed a mashup of &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and her hit single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; entitled &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Blue Monday Out of My Head&quot; at the Brit Awards. In 2007, the main riff in Rihanna&#x27;s song &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot; was so obviously based on &quot;Blue Monday&quot; that the four members of New Order got a co-writing credit for the song.

==Releases==
&quot;Blue Monday&quot; has been a hit several times in the UK. In 1983, it charted twice, initially reaching number 12 on the UK singles chart, then re-entering the chart later in the year and climbing to number 9, helped by the fact that neither side of the single (the B-side &quot;The Beach&quot; was an instrumental re-working of &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, whose lyrics include the line &quot;I thought I told you to leave me when I walked down to the beach&quot;) was featured on the UK version of the group&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;. Despite selling well it was not eligible for an official gold disc because Factory Records was not a member of the British Phonographic Industry association. According to the Official Charts Company, its total sales stand at 1.16 million in the United Kingdom alone, and &quot;Blue Monday&quot; came 69th in the all-time UK best-selling singles chart published in November 2012. As of March 2023 total consumed units across all formats have reached 2 million units sold in United Kingdom.

New Order appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, on 31 March 1983, to promote the song. New Order insisted on performing &quot;Blue Monday&quot; live. The performance was dogged by technical problems, and was unrepresentative of the recording. In the words of Morris, &quot;Blue Monday was never the easiest song to perform, anyway, and everything went wrong. The synthesisers went awry. It sounded awful.&quot;

In 1985, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; were released in Poland as a 7&quot; single in a different sleeve by Tonpress under license from Factory Records and sold over 50,000 copies and reached number 5 on the year-end single chart.

=== Alternative versions ===
In the mid-80s, New Order accepted to use &quot;Blue Monday&quot; in a commercial for the soft drink Sunkist, with new lyrics: &quot;How does it feel / When a new day has begun? / When you&#x27;re drinking in the sunshine/ Sunkist is the one&quot;.

In 1988, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was remixed by Quincy Jones and John Potoker as &quot;Blue Monday 1988&quot;. Jones was the owner of Qwest Records, New Order&#x27;s record label in the United States. The single reached number 3 on the British chart, number 4 on the Australian chart, and topped the dance chart in the United States.

A 1995 reissue, with a mix by Hardfloor as the lead track, also made the UK top 20. The song has sold 1.21 million copies in the UK as of October 2015.

=== Compilations ===
The single was not originally on &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;, but was included on the Gap Records Australia/New Zealand cassette version (though listed only on the cassette itself, not on the card), and the 1983 Qwest Records US CD version.

In 2008, Collector&#x27;s Editions of all New Order&#x27;s 1980s albums were released, with remastered versions of the original 12&quot; &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and its B-side &quot;The Beach&quot; appearing on the Collector&#x27;s Edition of &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;.

==Cover versions==
===Orgy versions===
&quot;Blue Monday&quot; was covered by American alternative metal band Orgy. It was released on 14 December 1998. Internationally, the song was a hit, appearing on music charts worldwide. It has been attributed with providing industrial and metal music with a fresh connection.

====Background====
In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; guitarist Amir Derakh said that upon working on the song they &quot;wanted to do the original &#x27;Blue Monday&#x27; justice&quot; and had expected more criticism. He went on to say that they felt lucky to have covered it and that they felt it could have been something that they had written. The fact that their first major hit was a cover of the 1980s electronica/dance song did not bother the band.

Their first official single release featured various versions of &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and upon the success of the song the band decided to include their previous single &quot;Stitches&quot; on the second release. With the label&#x27;s support this release was an enhanced CD that featured the music video for &quot;Blue Monday&quot; on 9 February 1999, which was in QuickTime format. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; has been made into several dance remixes, some which were produced to appeal to the underground dance club scene, and was even advertised under &quot;Club Mix&quot; 2000, a popular dance compilation series.

The music video for &quot;Blue Monday&quot; also appeared on several music television stations, and the song was also released on vinyl.

====Success====
The song appeared on modern rock radio stations, and was a hit on MTV; it appeared on MTV&#x27;s alternative music program &quot;120 Minutes&quot; and &quot;TRL&quot;, in which it debuted at number eight on 22 February 1999. The song was perceived as the band&#x27;s gateway to success, allowing them to tour in Ozzfest. and in the Family Values Tour and led to the rerelease of the song &quot;Stitches&quot;. The song appeared in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hits of the Year&quot; for 1999. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; is also said to have helped pave the way for the cyberpunk trend, as best exemplified in the popularity of the 1999 science fiction film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which appeared soon afterwards. In an interview of Joel Gallen in &quot;Los Angeles&quot; magazine, the music supervisors were discussing the use of Orgy&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; for a football scene in the film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), among others. Stating that the song &quot;had energy&quot;, they eventually selected it for the movie, and it appeared in the soundtrack as well.

&quot;Blue Monday&quot; charted internationally, some of which included &quot;CMJ&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Commercial Alternative Cuts&quot; and &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Alternative, Pop, and Dance song charts as well as others. It also appeared in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2000 as featured song clips.

====Reception====

Orgy&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; has been called the &quot;aggro-fied-for-the-1990s&quot; version of New Order&#x27;s song, and it is considered to be part of a resurgence of new wave covers by hard rock bands, along with Dope&#x27;s cover of Dead or Alive&#x27;s &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;. Many critics attribute the success of the album &quot;Candyass&quot; to &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, and some anticipated that Orgy would become a one-hit wonder, believing that it would be difficult for the band to follow up with another hit song. Many critics believed it to be their best song. Porter W. Richards of &quot;Sputnik&quot; felt that even though many of the songs off of &quot;Candyass&quot; sounded similar, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was a great song that should not be overlooked. While the New Order song is viewed positively by the author of the comic book series &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, Chynna Clugston, in an interview she expresses dislike for the misconception that she borrowed the title for her book from Orgy&#x27;s cover version rather than the original.

In a January 2000 &quot;Spin&quot; interview, Buckcherry&#x27;s vocalist Josh Todd and guitarist Keith Nelson did not speak highly of the song, likening its sound to a Nine Inch Nails rip-off and calling the sound &quot;mechanical&quot;.

===Flunk version===

Flunk covered the song and released it as a single in 2002. In this version, Flunk slows down &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, making it a popular hit for Flunk, based in part on the song&#x27;s wide recognition. The lyrics become the focus for this version rather than the danceable beat (which was emphasized in the original version). The single received generally positive reviews by electronic music critics, but Mallory O&#x27;Donnell of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; commented that Flunk &quot;only showed the paucity of melody&quot; of the original New Order song. The song was subsequently remixed, with at least 7 remixes along with the original version available. The original release was on the 2002 EP titled &quot;Blue Monday&quot;.

<doc id="699790" wikidata="Q1429071" url="?curid=699790" title="New York-New York Hotel and Casino">
<text>New York-New York Hotel and Casino is a casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International, and is designed to evoke New York City in its architecture and other aspects. The design features downsized replicas of numerous city landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty. The hotel tower represents various skyscrapers. Its tallest structure is a replica of the Empire State Building, standing at 47 stories and . This made New York-New York the tallest building in Nevada until the completion of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005. The property includes the Big Apple Coaster, which travels around the hotel tower. The casino is , and the hotel contains 2,024 rooms.

Construction began in March 1995, and the resort was built at a cost of $460 million. It opened on January 3, 1997, as a joint venture between MGM and Primadonna Resorts. MGM bought out the latter&#x27;s ownership stake in 1999. After the September 11 attacks, a spontaneous memorial site emerged in front of the resort&#x27;s Statue of Liberty. An official memorial was added in 2003, but was demolished 10 years later when the resort&#x27;s façade was remodeled. A Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate World was added in 2014, as part of the remodel. The resort has hosted various entertainers and shows, including comedian Rita Rudner, who performed there from 2001 to 2006; and the show &quot;Zumanity&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2020.

==History==

The 18-acre site at the northwest corner of the Tropicana – Las Vegas Boulevard intersection had been considered a prime spot for development due to its proximity to the MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Tropicana. Japanese firm Universal Distributing owned the property, and had discussed a joint venture with the Promus Companies to build a hotel-casino, but could not reach an agreement. In 1992, Kirk Kerkorian&#x27;s Tracinda Corporation bought the site for $31.5 million and offered MGM Grand Inc., of which Kerkorian owned 76%, a free two-year option to buy it.

The idea of a casino modeled after the New York skyline was conceived by Sig Rogich (a former White House staffer and United States Ambassador to Iceland) and Mark Advent. Rogich brought the idea to his friend, Gary Primm, head of Primadonna Resorts. Primm approached MGM president Bob Maxey in 1994 with the idea for MGM&#x27;s prime Strip location, and a joint venture was formed between the two companies. Construction began on March 30, 1995. The site had been partially occupied by the Lone Palm Motel and a Rodeway Inn.

The resort was scheduled to open on December 15, 1996, but this was pushed back nearly three weeks. Requests for pre-opening tours, made by media outlets and financial analysts, were rejected to maintain secrecy up until the resort&#x27;s debut. Completed at a cost of $460 million, New York-New York opened on January 3, 1997, at 12:30 a.m. A pre-opening celebration occurred the night before, with a fireworks show and 3,000 invited guests that included rival casino executives and celebrities.

The resort&#x27;s restaurants and room service were overseen by subcontractor ARK Restaurants Corporation, which employed non-union workers. In 1997, employees pushed for unionization with the Culinary Workers Union. ARK was against unionization and fought against allegations for the next six years that it had violated the National Labor Relations Act, ultimately losing in court.

In 1998, the Frank Sinatra album &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot; was put on sale exclusively at New York-New York, before receiving a wider release later that year. It includes the song &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot;.

Since the initiation of New York-New York, analysts had speculated that MGM Grand or Primadonna would buy out the other&#x27;s interest in the project. Instead of making such a cash-intensive purchase, however, MGM agreed to buy Primadonna outright for $276 million in stock plus $336 million in assumed debt. The merger closed in March 1999, giving MGM full control of New York-New York.

The 2001 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; was to include a scene of New York-New York being imploded, but this was removed following the September 11 attacks, and was replaced by a fictional hotel called the Xanadu. After the attacks, people spontaneously sent various tributes to New York-New York, especially T-shirts from police, fire and rescue departments around the country. These were displayed along the fence in front of the &quot;Lady Liberty&quot; replica. Other items included flowers and candles. Within a few days of the attacks, the spontaneous memorial site contained thousands of items. The twin towers of the original World Trade Center have never been included in the hotel&#x27;s skyscraper façade, which is meant to represent New York City in the 1940s; the World Trade Center was built in the 1970s. The towers were also considered too tall to be included.

An official September 11 memorial was unveiled at the site in 2003, featuring display boxes for various items. Some items, including approximately 4,000 T-shirts, were archived at Lied Library, part of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). New York-New York planned to rotate items from the collection to be displayed at the resort. Future items left at the resort would be donated to UNLV for archiving. The memorial site was created by Marnell Corrao Associates, which took inspiration from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The memorial was demolished in 2013, as MGM began a remodel of the property&#x27;s façade along Las Vegas Boulevard. A commemorative plaque was built at the former memorial site, while the items remain in storage at UNLV as of 2021. The collection contains nearly 6,000 items, most of them T-shirts.

Ownership of New York-New York, along with many other MGM properties, was transferred to MGM Growth Properties in 2016, while MGM Resorts continued to operate it under a lease agreement. Vici Properties acquired MGM Growth, including New York-New York, in 2022.

In August 2022, New York-New York announced plans to spend $63 million completely renovating 1,830 rooms and 155 of its suites by mid-2023.

===Shooting===
On July 6, 2007, gunman Steven Zegrean opened fire inside the casino shortly after midnight, wounding four people before bystanders subdued him. Zegrean had been depressed over two failed marriages and financial problems, and intended to commit suicide by cop. He faced 52 charges, although 16 would eventually be dismissed. In 2009, he was found guilty and sentenced to 26 to 90 years in prison. He died of a heart attack the following year. One of the victims filed a lawsuit against the resort and MGM, alleging inadequate security.

===Stamp error===
The Statue of Liberty Forever stamp, issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 2010, was intended to show the actual Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, but instead shows the replica at New York-New York. This is due to an error by the stamp designers, who incorrectly chose a stock photo of the replica instead of the original and did not recognize the difference. Even after the error was recognized, the Postal Service continued producing the stamp. A Postal Service spokesman said the service “would have selected this photograph anyway&quot;, citing its popularity and the service&#x27;s desire to produce a stamp that appeared different from previous stamps depicting the Statue of Liberty.

Robert Davidson, the sculptor of the Las Vegas statue, sued the Postal Service in 2013 for copyright infringement. His lawyers pointed out that the replica is a distinct piece of art, with intentional variations from the original Statue of Liberty. In July 2018, a judge ordered the Postal Service to pay Davidson $3.5 million.
==Design==
===Exterior===

The resort&#x27;s exterior was designed by Neal Gaskin and Ilia Bezansky, who closely studied travel books and architectural drawings rather than visit New York City. However, the design firm Yates-Silverman Inc. did send a team to the city to study its skyline for eight weeks.

The hotel is contained in a single building, although its exterior is designed to represent various New York skyscrapers joined together. The buildings are roughly one-third the size of their real-life counterparts. The tallest building is a 47-story, replica of the Empire State Building. This made New York-New York the tallest building in Nevada until the completion of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005; by comparison, the real Empire State Building is 102 stories tall.

Other buildings depicted in the hotel&#x27;s skyline include the Chrysler Building, the Manhattan Municipal Building, the New Yorker Hotel, and The Century. The interior differs throughout the hotel to reflect the design of four skyscrapers: the Empire State, Chrysler, Century, and New Yorker Hotel buildings. The other skyscrapers depicted in the skyline are not represented within the interior. Although the skyline is meant to represent New York City during the 1940s, it does include several buildings completed after that period, such as Lever House (1952), the Seagram Building (1958), the CBS Building (1965), 55 Water Street (1972), and 550 Madison Avenue (1984).

The exterior features a replica of the Statue of Liberty, situated at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue. A lagoon of fireboats sits at the base of the statue. The exterior also features an enlarged replica of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; the Main Immigration Building on Ellis Island; and Grand Central Terminal. A replica of the Brooklyn Bridge runs along the property&#x27;s façade on Las Vegas Boulevard.

New York-New York had been the only Strip resort without a roadside sign. Resort president Felix Rappaport said &quot;the building has always been its own marquee&quot;. A $10 million sign, rising , was eventually added in 2003. A 30-foot-long neon sign, located above the resort&#x27;s Strip entrance, was dismantled in 2014, amid renovations. It was donated to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum.

===Interior===

The interior was designed by Yates-Silverman Inc. The casino is meant to resemble various areas of New York, including Broadway, Central Park, Greenwich Village, Times Square, and Wall Street.

The central area of the casino floor was named Central Park and featured lamps, fake trees, and a large façade depicting the New York Stock Exchange Building. A high roller gaming area was designed to resemble the Rockefeller Center promenade. Cobblestone pathways lead past various eateries and retail shops with mock building façades. A food court, designed with architect Hugh Hardy as a consultant, was created to resemble Little Italy, Manhattan.

===Reception===
In the late 1990s, New York-New York won various accolades from the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; in its annual &quot;Best of Las Vegas&quot; awards. These included best Strip hotel and best hotel architecture (1997), best Las Vegas Architecture (1998), and coolest building in Las Vegas and best hotel theme (1999). It also won a Thea award in 1998 for Outstanding Achievement.

Architecture critic Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;On one level, this is the most ridiculous building imaginable, a cynical slap in the face at the notion that time and history carry some weight in the experience of place. On another level, it is an earnest, eager celebration of a world far away from Las Vegas, and it couldn&#x27;t be more entertaining&quot;. Another critic, Benjamin Forgey of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote that the skyscraper replicas &quot;are made, literally, out of Styrofoam (on a steel backing) -- they don&#x27;t exactly have the feel of bricks and mortar. More important, the scale is so out of whack that, despite its immense size, the building has the look and feel of a giant toy.&quot; Critic Nicolai Ouroussoff, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, called New York-New York a &quot;freakish apparition&quot;.

===Lawsuits===
The property&#x27;s design led to several lawsuits. In 1996, the architecture firm Domingo Cambeiro sued Rogich, Advent and others affiliated with the project, claiming to have drawn up design plans for a mall project in 1993, known as New York CityCenter. The firm alleged similarities between the initial project and the final design of the resort, and said it was never compensated for its work. In 1998, a federal judge ruled against the firm, which subsequently filed a state lawsuit against Advent, alleging breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. Domingo Cambeiro filed a third lawsuit later in 1998, to which Advent said, &quot;Cambeiro has harassed me for several years with civil actions in an attempt to win a case that has no merit. Desperate people do desperate things&quot;.

After the resort&#x27;s opening, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed a lawsuit over the use of the stylized interior façade depicting its NYSE Building. The NYSE also objected to the name of the casino&#x27;s slot club, &quot;New York $lot Exchange&quot;, as well as signs reading &quot;NY$E&quot; and &quot;New York, New York Stock Exchange&quot;. The NYSE was concerned that its reputation would be damaged by the resort, stating that the NYSE façade and $lot Exchange &quot;have the likelihood of deceiving or confusing the public ... and bastardizing the NYSE marks by making them subject to ridicule&quot;. A lawyer for the resort responded that, &quot;New York-New York is full of parody and parody is protected speech&quot;. A court ruled in the resort&#x27;s favor, although the NYSE appealed the decision. New York-New York eventually retired the &quot;$lot Exchange&quot; name.

Shortly after the opening, the United States Department of Justice found various areas of the resort – including the entrance, hotel rooms, and pedestrian bridges – to be non-compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. MGM subsequently sued 14 contractors and subcontractors over the faulty work.

==Features==

New York-New York includes a casino. At its opening, the casino measured , and had 2,400 slot machines and 71 table games. The hotel contains 2,024 rooms. When the resort opened, it featured a second-floor, video game arcade which also included bumper cars and laser tag.

The property also included a cigar lounge known as Hamilton&#x27;s, named after actor George Hamilton, majority owner of the lounge. Hamilton&#x27;s provided a view overlooking the casino floor, and included a retail shop and a private back room known as the Club Car, resembling an upscale rail car. Hamilton&#x27;s had capacity for 175 people, while the Club Car could hold an additional 30. The lounge closed in January 2000, amid poor business. The trend of cigar bars had died off, and the closure of the resort&#x27;s wedding chapel was also cited, as Hamilton&#x27;s typically hosted wedding receptions.

A renovation in 1999 added more meeting space and a restaurant, as well as upgrades for more than 300 rooms. A computerized valet parking system was implemented in 2001, to reduce wait times.
New York-New York opened with four restaurants and a food court. Several of the same dining establishments were still in operation as of 2016. Among the original restaurants is Il Fornaio, an Italian eatery; and Chin Chin, an Asian restaurant. Both are part of California-based restaurant chains. Another original restaurant is Gallagher&#x27;s Steak House. Unlike most casinos of the pre-Covid-19 era, New York-New York never had a buffet.

The Motown Cafe and Nightclub opened along with the resort, before closing in 2000. It was replaced a year later by an ESPN Zone. The casino also opened a Coyote Ugly Saloon later in 2001. Both were added to reinvigorate the resort, which had lost some business to newer properties such as Mandalay Bay and Paris Las Vegas. An Irish pub and restaurant, Nine Fine Irishman, opened in July 2003. It was the only Irish pub on the Strip.

A nightclub, known as Rok Vegas, opened in August 2008. It consisted of an oval-shaped space with an overhead television screen which wrapped around the room for 360-degree views. It could be used to show a variety of footage, such as concerts. The club played various types of music to attract a broad demographic. It had seating for 880 people. It featured a stage for performers, and also included an outdoor patio along the Las Vegas Strip, where DJ parties would take place. The club closed in 2012.

The ESPN Zone closed in 2010, and was replaced later that year by the Sporting House Bar and Grill. Like its predecessor, it was also focused on sports. The two-floor Sporting House included more than 130 televisions for sports viewing. It also had an arcade with 60 games. It closed in 2014. Shake Shack opened its first Las Vegas location at New York-New York later that year. A Tom&#x27;s Urban restaurant with three bars was added in 2015. Both restaurants took the space formerly occupied by the Sporting House.

The 2013-14 façade renovation included the addition of a two-story Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate World, which serves as the flagship store.

===Big Apple Coaster===
The Big Apple Coaster (formerly Manhattan Express and The Roller Coaster) travels through the property&#x27;s interior and exterior along a track. The coaster is high, has a maximum drop of , and reaches speeds up to . The ride has undergone a variety of enhancements including the introduction of a magnetic braking system and new trains. The roller coaster has trains that resemble a traditional Checker Cab.

The roller coaster opened along with the resort, as the Manhattan Express. Built by TOGO, it was one of only two roller coasters in the world to feature a heartline roll and dive.

==Shows and entertainers==
&quot;MADhattan&quot;, a $7.5 million show featuring street performers from New York City, was launched in June 1997. The show was produced by Kenneth Feld, who conceived it three years earlier. The show was reworked from a prior, short-lived revue in New York known as &quot;Street Songs&quot;. Singers and dancers were among the performers in &quot;MADhattan&quot;, and the sets were designed to portray areas of New York City. Initial ticket sales were poor, which prompted a fine-tuning of the show and a new advertising campaign. The show closed in May 1998, due to poor box-office results. It was replaced by &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, an Irish stepdancing show. It opened in July 1998, and ran for four years and 2,000 performances.

Comedian Rita Rudner began performing at the resort in April 2001, in a new venue dubbed the Cabaret Theatre. It was renovated in 2004, adding raked movie theater-style seating. Rudner concluded her show in 2006, selling out more than 600,000 tickets and grossing $35 million over the course of her run.

&quot;Zumanity&quot;, an adult-themed show by Cirque du Soleil, debuted at New York-New York in 2003, replacing &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;. &quot;Zumanity&quot; was the third show from Cirque du Soleil to take up permanent residence in the Las Vegas Valley. It was the first Cirque show to be directed primarily toward adult audiences. It was the only permanent Cirque show to allow admission only to those over 18 years of age. The theater was arranged as a cabaret, with sofas and bar stools complementing the standard theater seats. &quot;Zumanity&quot; became a long-running success, hosting more than 7,700 performances. The final performance took place on March 14, 2020, with the show closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Later that year, Cirque du Soleil announced that the closure would be permanent.

In 2012, producer David King leased the former space of Rok Vegas and opened it as the Broadway Theater, a 200-seat venue for several shows produced by him. Among them was &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, which featured songs by ABBA. The show closed in July 2013, along with the Broadway Theater, which was demolished as part of the resort&#x27;s façade renovation.

For a brief period in 2021, ventriloquist Terry Fator entertained in the former &quot;Zumanity&quot; theater. Later that year, he relocated his show to the resort&#x27;s Liberty Loft, an event space overlooking the sportsbook.

&quot;Mad Apple&quot;, a new show by Cirque du Soleil, opened on May 26, 2022. It features a variety of performers, including singers and comedians. It is hosted in the former &quot;Zumanity&quot; theater, which seats 1,200 people.

[[Geography]] is the study of the world and of the distribution of life on the earth, including human life and the effects of human activity. Geography research addresses both the questions of &quot;where&quot;, as well as &quot;why&quot;, geographical phenomena occur. Geography is a diverse field that seeks to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but how they came to be, and how they have changed since then.

<doc id="699826" wikidata="Q7232785" url="?curid=699826" title="Personal pronouns in Portuguese">
<text>The Portuguese personal pronouns and possessives display a higher degree of inflection than other parts of speech. Personal pronouns have distinct forms according to whether they stand for a subject (nominative), a direct object (accusative), an indirect object (dative), or a reflexive object. Several pronouns further have special forms used after prepositions.

The possessive pronouns are the same as the possessive adjectives, but each is inflected to express the grammatical person of the possessor and the grammatical gender of the possessed.

Pronoun use displays considerable variation with register and dialect, with particularly pronounced differences between the most colloquial varieties of European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.

==Subject, object, and complement==

===Basic forms===
The personal pronouns of Portuguese have three basic forms: subject, object (object of a verb), and prepositional (object of a preposition).
:1 direct object (masculine and feminine)
:2 indirect object
:3 reflexive or reciprocal, direct or indirect object

===Subject pronouns===

====Forms of address====
Like most European languages, Portuguese has different words for &quot;you&quot;, according to the degree of formality that the speaker wishes to show towards the addressee (T-V distinction). In very broad terms, &quot;tu&quot;, &quot;você&quot; (both meaning singular &quot;you&quot;) and &quot;vocês&quot; (plural &quot;you&quot;) are used in informal situations, while in formal contexts &quot;o senhor&quot;, &quot;a senhora&quot;, &quot;os senhores&quot; and &quot;as senhoras&quot; (masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural &quot;you&quot;, respectively) are preferred. However, there is considerable regional variation in the use of these terms, and more specific forms of address are sometimes employed.

Generally speaking, &quot;tu&quot; is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. &quot;Você&quot; indicates distance without deference, and tends to be used between people who are, roughly, social equals. &quot;O senhor&quot; / &quot;a senhora&quot; (literally &quot;the sir / the madam&quot;) are the most ceremonious forms of address. English speakers may find the latter construction akin to the parliamentary convention of referring to fellow legislators in the third person (as &quot;my colleague&quot;, &quot;the gentleman&quot;, &quot;the member&quot;, etc.), although the level of formality conveyed by &quot;o senhor&quot; is not as great. In fact, variants of &quot;o senhor&quot; and &quot;a senhora&quot; with more nuanced meanings such as titles as &quot;o professor&quot; (&quot;the professor&quot;), &quot;o doutor&quot; (&quot;the doctor&quot;), &quot;o colega&quot; (&quot;the colleague&quot;) and &quot;o pai&quot; (&quot;the father&quot;) are also employed as personal pronouns. In the plural, there are two main levels of politeness, the informal &quot;vocês&quot; or &quot;vós&quot; and the formal &quot;os senhores&quot; / &quot;as senhoras&quot;.

This threefold scheme is, however, complicated by regional and social variation. For example, in many communities of Brazilian Portuguese speakers, the traditional &quot;tu&quot;/&quot;você&quot; distinction has been lost, and the previously formal &quot;você&quot; tends to replace the familiar &quot;tu&quot; in most cases (the distinction remains, however, in most parts of the country). On the other hand, in Portugal it is common to use a person&#x27;s own name as a pronoun more or less equivalent to &quot;você&quot;, e.g., &quot;o José&quot;, &quot;o senhor Silva&quot;, which is rare in Brazil (though it is found in parts of the Northeast region, for example). The explicit use of &quot;você&quot; may be discouraged in Portugal because it may sound too informal for many situations.
In Mozambique, however, the use of the imperative neutralizes the forms of the 2nd person singular (tu) and (você/senhor). Thus, forms of the imperative with features [+ informal] associated with the pronoun [- informal] (você/senhor) are observable. Also if find shapes with features [+ formal] associated with the pronoun [- formal] (tu)

When addressing older people or hierarchical superiors, modern BP speakers often replace &quot;você&quot;/&quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vocês&quot; with the expressions &quot;o(s) senhor(es)&quot; and &quot;a(s) senhora(s)&quot;, which also require third-person verb forms and third-person reflexive/possessive pronouns (or, for the possessive, the expressions &quot;de vocês&quot;, &quot;do senhor&quot;, etc.). The expressions &quot;o(s) senhor(es)&quot; and &quot;a(s) senhora(s)&quot; are also used in formal contexts in modern EP, in addition to a large number of similar pronominalized nouns that vary according to the person who is being addressed, e.g. &quot;a menina&quot;, &quot;o pai&quot;, &quot;a mãe&quot;, &quot;o engenheiro&quot;, &quot;o doutor&quot;, etc.

Historically, &quot;você&quot; derives from &quot;vossa mercê&quot; (&quot;your mercy&quot; or &quot;your grace&quot;) via the intermediate forms &quot;vossemecê&quot; and &quot;vosmecê&quot;.

====&quot;Nós&quot; vs. &quot;a gente&quot;====
A common colloquial alternative to the first-person-plural pronoun &quot;nós&quot; &quot;we&quot; is the noun phrase &quot;a gente&quot; (literally meaning &quot;the people&quot;), which formally takes verbs and possessives of the third person singular (or the expression &quot;da gente&quot;). Although avoided in the most formal registers, it is not considered incorrect, unless it is accompanied by verbs conjugated in the first person plural, as in &quot;*A gente moramos na cidade&quot;, instead of the normative &quot;A gente mora na cidade&quot; &quot;We live in the city&quot;.

====&quot;Vós&quot;====
In nearly all Portuguese dialects and registers, the second-person plural subject pronoun &quot;vós&quot; is usually replaced by &quot;vocês&quot; and in many cases it is no longer in use, as is the case with its corresponding verb forms. Currently, &quot;vós&quot; (with its verb forms) is frequently employed only in the following contexts:
* In some dialects of northern Portugal (i.e., in the colloquial spoken language).
* In some forms of address (e.g. Vossa Senhoria, Vossa Santidade...)
* In religious texts and services.
* In old texts.
* In formal registers being used as a singular second-person pronoun, for archaism.
* In historical fiction.

For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality, not knowing that &quot;vós&quot; is used for plural in the same context as &quot;tu&quot; is used for singular.

Instead, the word &quot;vocês&quot; is used, or equivalent forms of address which take verbs and possessives of the third-person plural. In European Portuguese, however, object &quot;vos&quot; as well as &quot;convosco&quot; (but &quot;not&quot; prepositional &quot;vós&quot;) and &quot;vosso&quot; have survived, even in formal situations; see the &quot;Forms of address&quot; section, above, and also the notes on colloquial usage, at the bottom of the page.

===Object pronouns===

====Proclisis, enclisis, and mesoclisis====
As in other Romance languages, object pronouns are clitics, which must come next to a verb, and are pronounced together with it as a unit. They may appear before the verb (proclisis, &quot;lhe dizer&quot;), after the verb, linked to it with a hyphen (enclisis, &quot;dizer-lhe&quot;), or, more rarely, within the verb, between its stem and its desinence (mesoclisis, &quot;dir-lhe-ei&quot;).

Enclisis and mesoclisis may entail some historically motivated changes of verb endings and/or pronouns, e.g. &quot;cantar&quot; + &quot;o&quot; (originally &quot;*lo&quot;, from Latin &quot;illum&quot;) = &quot;cantá-lo&quot; &quot;to sing it&quot;. The direct and indirect object pronouns can be contracted, as in &quot;dar&quot; + &quot;lhe&quot; + &quot;os&quot; = &quot;dar-lhos&quot; &quot;to give them to him&quot;; cf. Spanish &quot;dar&quot; + &quot;le&quot; + &quot;los&quot; = &quot;dárselos&quot;.

:&quot;comprá-lo-ei&quot; = &quot;comprarei&quot; (Late Latin &quot;comparāre habeō&quot;, two words) + &quot;o&quot; &quot;I will buy it&quot;.
:&quot;dar-to-ia&quot; = &quot;daria&quot; (&quot;dare habēbam&quot;) + &quot;te&quot; + &quot;o&quot; &quot;I would give it to you&quot;.
:&quot;dar-lho-ia&quot; = &quot;daria&quot; + &quot;lhe&quot; + &quot;o&quot; &quot;I would give it to him&quot;.

When a verb conjugated in the 1st person plural, ending in &quot;-s&quot;, is followed by the enclitic pronoun &quot;nos&quot; or &quot;vos&quot;, the &quot;s&quot; is dropped: &quot;Vamo-nos&quot; [&quot;vamos&quot; + &quot;nos&quot;] &quot;embora amanhã&quot; (&quot;We are leaving tomorrow&quot;), &quot;Respeitemo-nos&quot; [&quot;respeitemos&quot; + &quot;nos&quot;] &quot;mutuamente&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s respect each other&quot;), &quot;Vemo-vos&quot; [&quot;vemos&quot; + &quot;vos&quot;] (&quot;We see you&quot;), etc.

====Allomorphs====
Third person direct object clitic pronouns have several forms, depending on their position with relation to the verb and on the verb&#x27;s ending. If the pronoun is enclitic and the verb ends with a consonant, or if the pronoun is mesoclitic and the root of the verb ends with a consonant, then that consonant is elided, and an &quot;l&quot; is added to the beginning of the pronoun. If the pronoun is enclitic and the verb ends with a nasal diphthong (spelled &quot;-ão&quot;, &quot;-am&quot;, &quot;-em&quot;, &quot;-ém&quot;, &quot;-êm&quot;, &quot;-õe&quot;, or &quot;-õem&quot;), an &quot;n&quot; is added to the beginning of the pronoun. The same happens after other clitic pronouns, and after the adverbial particle &quot;eis&quot;.
The third person forms &quot;o&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;os&quot;, and &quot;as&quot; may present the variants &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, &quot;las&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;na&quot;, &quot;nos&quot;, and &quot;nas&quot;:
* The variants &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;los&quot;, and &quot;las&quot; are used after verbal forms ending with a consonant, which is elided. Examples: &quot;seduz&quot; + &quot;a&quot; = &quot;sedu-la&quot;, &quot;faz&quot; + &quot;o&quot; = &quot;fá-lo&quot;, &quot;diz&quot; + &quot;o&quot; = &quot;di-lo&quot;, &quot;destróis&quot; + &quot;os&quot; = &quot;destrói-los&quot; (different from &quot;destrói-os&quot;, in which the verb is conjugated in the imperative mood), &quot;comes&quot; + &quot;a&quot; = &quot;come-la&quot; (different from &quot;come-a&quot; = &quot;come&quot; + &quot;a&quot;), &quot;apanha-las&quot; (&quot;apanhas&quot; + &quot;as&quot;), &quot;amá-lo&quot; (&quot;amar&quot; +&quot;o&quot;), &quot;fazê-lo&quot; (&quot;fazer&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;partire-lo&quot; (&quot;partires&quot; +&quot;o&quot;), &quot;tem-la&quot; (&quot;tens&quot; + &quot;a&quot;—the &quot;n&quot; changes to &quot;m&quot;). Exceptionally, &quot;quer&quot; + &quot;o&quot; gives &quot;quere-o&quot;, rather than *&quot;qué-lo&quot; (&quot;qué-lo&quot; is still permitted, but uncommon).
** This also occurs when the pronoun is in mesoclitic position: &quot;matá-lo-ás&quot; (&quot;matarás&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;fá-lo-ias&quot; (&quot;farias&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;feri-lo-ias&quot; (&quot;feririas&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;comê-lo-ias&quot; (&quot;comerias&quot; + &quot;o&quot;).
* The variants &quot;no&quot;, &quot;na&quot;, &quot;nos&quot; and &quot;nas&quot; are used after a verbal form ending with a nasal diphthong. Examples: &quot;põe-no&quot; (&quot;põe&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;tem-na&quot; (&quot;tem&quot; + &quot;a&quot;), &quot;comeram-nos&quot; (ambiguous, can mean &quot;comeram&quot; + &quot;os&quot; &quot;they ate them&quot;, or &quot;comeram&quot; + &quot;nos&quot; &quot;they ate us&quot;).
* The pronouns &quot;o&quot;, etc. present the same forms as above when they follow other clitic pronouns, such as &quot;nos&quot; and &quot;vos&quot;, or the adverbial particle &quot;eis&quot;. Examples: &quot;ei-lo aqui&quot; (&quot;eis&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;deram-no-lo&quot; (&quot;deram&quot; + &quot;nos&quot; + &quot;o&quot;), &quot;&quot;Não vo-lo&quot; [&quot;vos + o&quot;] &quot;quero dar a entender&quot;.&quot;

====Contractions between clitic pronouns====
The contraction for &quot;lhes&quot; + &quot;o&quot; is &quot;lho&quot;, not *&quot;lhe-lo&quot; or *&quot;lhos&quot;. This occurs because &quot;lhe&quot; used to be employed indistinctly for the singular and the plural and, while the agglutinated form suffered no alteration, &quot;lhe&quot; evolved into &quot;lhes&quot; for the plural number.

These contracted forms are rarely encountered in modern Brazilian usage.

====Syntax====
Apart from the pronouns that act as subjects of a sentence, and from the stressed object pronouns which are employed after prepositions, Portuguese has several clitic object pronouns used with nonprepositional verbs, or as indirect objects. These can appear before the verb as separate words, as in &quot;ela me ama&quot; (&quot;she loves me&quot;), or appended to the verb after the tense/person inflection, as in &quot;ele amou-a&quot; (&quot;he loved her&quot;) or &quot;ele deu-lhe o livro&quot; (&quot;he gave her/him the book&quot;). Note that Portuguese spelling rules (like those of French) require a hyphen between the verb and the enclitic pronoun.

In West Iberian-Romance, the position of clitic object pronouns with respect to the verbs which govern them was flexible, but all Romance languages have since adopted a more strict syntax. The usual pattern is for clitics to precede the verb; e.g. Sp. &quot;Yo te amo&quot;, Fr. &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot; &quot;I love you&quot;; Fr. &quot;Tu m&#x27;avais dit&quot; &quot;You had told me&quot; (proclisis). The opposite order occurs only with the imperative: Sp. &quot;Dime&quot;, Fr. &quot;Dis-moi&quot; &quot;Tell me&quot; (enclisis). Spoken Brazilian Portuguese has taken more or less the same route, except that clitics usually appear between the auxiliary verb and the main verb in compound tenses, and proclisis is even more generalized: &quot;Eu te amo&quot; &quot;I love you&quot;, but &quot;Me diz&quot; &quot;Tell me&quot;, and &quot;Você tinha me dito&quot; &quot;You had told me&quot;.

In European Portuguese, by contrast, enclisis is the default position for clitic pronouns in simple affirmative clauses: &quot;Eu amo-te&quot; &quot;I love you&quot;, &quot;Diz-me&quot; &quot;Tell me&quot;. In compound tenses, the clitic normally follows the auxiliary verb, &quot;Você tinha-me dito&quot; &quot;You had told me&quot; (like in Brazilian Portuguese, but conventionally spelled with a hyphen), though other positions are sometimes possible: &quot;Você vai dizer-me&quot; &quot;You are going to tell me&quot; (Spanish allows this syntax as well, for example &quot;Vas a decirme&quot;), &quot;Você não me vai dizer&quot; &quot;You are not going to tell me&quot;. Still, in formal Portuguese the clitic pronouns always follow the verb in the infinitive. The Brazilian proclisis is usually &quot;correct&quot; in European Portuguese (often found in medieval literature), though nowadays uncommon and emphatic. Only sentences that begin with a clitic pronoun, such as &quot;Te amo&quot; or &quot;Me diz&quot;, are considered unacceptable in European Portuguese.

With verbs in the future indicative tense or the conditional tense, enclitic pronouns are not placed after the verb, but rather incorporated into it: &quot;eu canto-te uma balada&quot; &quot;I sing you a ballad&quot; becomes &quot;eu cantar-te-ei uma balada&quot; &quot;I will sing you a ballad&quot; in the future, and &quot;eu cantar-te-ia uma balada&quot; &quot;I would sing you a ballad&quot; in the conditional (mesoclisis).

This is because these verb forms were originally compounds of the infinitive and &quot;haver&quot;: &quot;cantarei&quot; = &quot;cantar hei&quot;, &quot;cantarás&quot; = &quot;cantar hás&quot;. In spoken Brazilian Portuguese, where proclisis is nearly universal, mesoclisis never occurs. Although the mesoclisis is often cited as a distinctive feature of Portuguese, it is becoming rare in spoken European Portuguese, since there is a growing tendency to replace the future indicative and the conditional with other tenses.

Although enclisis (or mesoclisis) is the default position for clitic pronouns in European Portuguese, there are several instances in which proclisis will be used due to certain elements or words that &quot;attract&quot; the pronoun to appear before, rather than after, the verb. For example, a simple affirmative sentence or command will be enclitic (mesoclitic in the future or conditional). However, the following elements attract the pronoun and cause proclisis even in European Portuguese: (1) negative words, (2) interrogative words, (3) conjunctions/dependent clauses, (4) certain common adverbs such as &quot;ainda&quot;, &quot;já&quot;, &quot;sempre&quot;, etc., and (5) indefinite pronouns such as &quot;todos&quot;. Since proclisis is already the normal default position for clitic pronouns in Brazilian Portuguese, this marking between enclisis and proclisis does not exist.

===Prepositional pronouns===

====Governance====
The personal pronouns labelled &quot;object of preposition&quot; above are always employed after a preposition, and most prepositions govern those pronouns, but a few of them require subject pronouns. For example, prepositions denoting exception, such as &quot;afora&quot;, &quot;fora&quot;, &quot;excepto&quot;, &quot;menos&quot;, &quot;salvo&quot;, and &quot;tirante&quot;. In those cases, the subject pronouns &quot;eu&quot;, &quot;tu&quot;, &quot;ele&quot;, &quot;ela&quot;, &quot;eles&quot; and &quot;elas&quot; are used. Examples: &quot;Todos foram ao cinema excepto eu&quot;, &quot;Ele referiu toda a gente excepto ele mesmo&quot; (not *&quot;Ele referiu toda a gente excepto si&quot;), but &quot;Ele referiu-se a toda a gente excepto a si&quot;, &quot;Falaste a todos menos a mim&quot;, &quot;Falaste com todos menos comigo&quot; (not *&quot;com eu&quot;).

====Contractions with the prepositions &quot;de&quot; and &quot;em&quot;====
The following 3rd person pronouns contract with the prepositions &quot;de&quot; &quot;of/from&quot; and &quot;em&quot; &quot;in/on/at&quot;.
====Contractions with the preposition &quot;com&quot;====
The following prepositional pronouns contract with the preposition &quot;com&quot; &quot;with&quot; (circumstantial complement).
The form &quot;connosco&quot; is used in European Portuguese, while &quot;conosco&quot; is used in Brazilian Portuguese.

These contractions are derived from the Latin practice of suffixing the preposition &quot;cum&quot; &quot;with&quot; to the end of the ablative form of personal pronouns, as in &quot;mecum&quot; or &quot;tecum&quot;. In Vulgar Latin, enclitic &quot;cum&quot; (later shifted to &quot;-go&quot;) became fossilized and was reanalysed as part of the pronoun itself. Then, a second &quot;cum&quot; began to be used before those words, and finally &quot;cum mecum&quot;, &quot;cum tecum&quot;, etc. contracted, producing &quot;comigo&quot;, &quot;contigo&quot;, and so on.

===Reflexive pronouns===
Reflexive pronouns are used when one wants to express the action is exercised upon the same person that exercises it or refers to such person. Examples:
*EP: &quot;Eu vi-me ao espelho.&quot; BP: &quot;Eu me vi no espelho.&quot;
*&quot;Não te levas muito a sério.&quot;
*EP: &quot;De repente, vimo-nos perdidos na floresta.&quot; BP: &quot;De repente, nos vimos perdidos na floresta.&quot;
In the third person, the reflexive pronoun has a form of its own, &quot;se&quot;, or &quot;si&quot; if preceded by a preposition. Examples:
*EP: &quot;Hoje ele levantou-se cedo.&quot; BP: &quot;Hoje ele se levantou cedo.&quot;
*EP: &quot;Eles lavam-se sempre muito bem.&quot; BP: &quot;Eles se lavam sempre muito bem.&quot;
*&quot;O gato sabe cuidar bem de si.&quot;
*&quot;Os ladrões levaram consigo tudo o que puderam.&quot; (see above for compounds with &quot;com&quot;)
The reflexive pronoun forms, when used in the plural (&quot;me&quot; and &quot;te&quot; are therefore excluded), may indicate reciprocity. In those cases, they do not have reflexive character – for instance, &quot;as pessoas cumprimentaram-se&quot; does not mean that each person complimented him-/herself, rather they complimented each other. In some situations, this may create ambiguity; therefore, if one means &quot;they love each other&quot;, one might want to say &quot;eles amam-se mutuamente or &quot;eles amam-se um ao outro (although &quot;eles amam-se&quot; will probably be interpreted this way anyhow); if one means &quot;each one of them loves him-/herself&quot;, one should say &quot;eles amam-se a si mesmos ou &quot;eles amam-se a si próprios.

Sometimes, especially in the spoken Portuguese, &quot;ele mesmo&quot;, &quot;ela mesma&quot;, &quot;com ele mesmo&quot;, &quot;com eles mesmos&quot;, etc. may be used instead of &quot;si&quot; and &quot;consigo&quot;. Example: &quot;Eles têm de ter confiança neles &quot;[&quot;em &quot;+&quot; eles&quot;]&quot; mesmos&quot; or &quot;Eles têm de ter confiança em si (mesmos)&quot;.

==Possessive pronouns and adjectives==
The forms of the possessives depends on the gender and number of the possessed object or being.
The possessive pronouns are identical to possessive adjectives, except that they must be preceded by the definite article (&quot;o meu&quot;, &quot;a minha&quot;, &quot;os meus&quot;, &quot;as minhas&quot;, etc.) For the possessive adjectives, the article is optional, and its use varies with dialect and degree of formality.

===Clearing ambiguity in the 3rd person===
Due to the use of &quot;seu(s)&quot;, &quot;sua(s)&quot; as 2nd-person possessive pronouns, &quot;dele(s)&quot; and &quot;dela(s)&quot; are normally used as 3rd-person possessive markers in lieu of &quot;seu(s)&quot;/&quot;sua(s)&quot; to eliminate ambiguity, e.g. &quot;Onde está o seu carro&quot; (&quot;Where is your car?&quot;) vs. &quot;Onde está o carro dele?&quot; (&quot;Where is his car?&quot;). &quot;Seu&quot;/&quot;Sua&quot; used as 3rd-person possessive pronouns are still frequent, especially when referring to the subject of the clause or when the gender is unknown and ambiguity can be solved in context, e.g. &quot;O Candidato Geraldo Alckmin apresentou ontem a sua proposta para aumentar a geração de empregos no Brasil&quot; (&quot;The candidate Geraldo Alckmin presented yesterday his proposal to increase job creation in Brazil&quot;).

==Colloquial usage==

===In European Portuguese===
In European Portuguese, &quot;si&quot; and &quot;consigo&quot; can also be used to refer to the person to whom the message is directed in the formal treatment by &quot;o senhor&quot;, etc. or in the treatment by &quot;você&quot;. They are employed in the same circumstances &quot;ti&quot; and &quot;contigo&quot; would be used in the treatment by &quot;tu&quot;. Actually, in those circumstances &quot;você&quot; and &quot;com você&quot; is uncommonly used and considered incorrect.

Examples:

*&quot;Se você não se importar, eu vou consigo.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll go with you, if you don&#x27;t mind.&quot; (&quot;Se você não se importar, eu vou com você&quot; would sound strange in some regions and is generally considered a wrong construction.)
*&quot;Quando estava a passar pela Praça do Chile, lembrei-me de si&quot;. &quot;When I was going through the Praça do Chile (the Chile park), it reminded me of you.&quot;

Thus, in modern colloquial European Portuguese, the classical paradigm above is modified to (differences emphasized):

&quot;Se&quot;, &quot;si&quot;, and &quot;consigo&quot; are used in standard written BP exclusively as reflexive pronouns, e.g. &quot;Os manifestantes trouxeram consigo paus e pedras para se defenderem da violência policial&quot; (&quot;Protesters brought (wood) sticks and stones with them to protect themselves against police brutality&quot;), or &quot;Os políticos discutiam entre si o que fazer diante da decisão do Supremo Tribunal&quot; (&quot;Politicians discussed among themselves what to do in face of the Supreme Court decision&quot;). In colloquial language, those reflexive forms may be replaced however by subject pronouns (e.g. &quot;Discutam entre vocês em que data preferem fazer o exame&quot; vs standard &quot;Discutam entre si em que data preferem fazer o exame&quot;, Eng. &quot;Discuss among yourselves when you prefer to take the exam&quot;). Note also that in both standard and colloquial BP, it is considered &quot;wrong&quot; to use &quot;se&quot;, &quot;si&quot;, &quot;consigo&quot; in non-reflexive contexts. Therefore, unlike in modern colloquial EP, &quot;para si&quot; for example cannot ordinarily replace &quot;para você&quot;, nor can &quot;consigo&quot; ordinarily replace &quot;com você&quot;.

===In Brazilian Portuguese===

For modern Brazilian Portuguese, one could propose the following chart (departures from the norm are in italics):

====&quot;Tu&quot; vs. &quot;você&quot;====
Although the 3rd person pronoun &quot;você&quot; tended to replace the classical 2nd-person pronoun &quot;tu&quot; in several Brazilian dialects and, especially, in the media communication, the use of &quot;tu&quot; is still frequent in several Brazilian Portuguese dialects. Most of the dialects that retain &quot;tu&quot; also use accordingly &quot;te&quot; (accusative pronoun), &quot;ti&quot; (dative postprepositional pronoun), &quot;contigo&quot;, and the possessive &quot;teu, tua, teus, and tuas&quot;. The use of &quot;tu&quot; is dominant in the South (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and parts of Paraná) and Northeast (with the exception of most of Bahia and some other areas, mostly in the coast), and it is also very frequent in the Northern region and Rio de Janeiro.

However, even in some of the regions where &quot;você&quot; is the prevailing pronoun, the object pronoun &quot;te&quot; and &quot;ti&quot; and the possessive pronoun &quot;teu&quot;/&quot;tua&quot; are quite common, although not in most of São Paulo, Brazil&#x27;s most populous state. In fact, in the city of São Paulo the pronoun &quot;tu&quot; is almost nonexistent.

That distinction, object and possessive pronouns pattern likewise, is still maintained in the South and in the area around the city of Santos (in State of São Paulo) and in the Northeast. In Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, for instance, &quot;você&quot; is rarely used in spoken language—in most occasions, &quot;o senhor&quot;/&quot;a senhora&quot; is employed whenever &quot;tu&quot; may sound too informal.

In most of the Northeast, &quot;você&quot; is frequently used only in semi-formal and formal conversations, mostly with people whom one does not know well or when a more polite or serious style is required. As for Rio de Janeiro and the North of Brazil, both &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;você&quot; (and associated object and possessive pronouns) are used with no clear distinction in their use.

However, when one talks to older people or people of higher status (a boss, for example), most Brazilians prefer to use &quot;o senhor&quot; and &quot;a senhora&quot;.

In standard Portuguese (both in Brazil and in Portugal), &quot;você&quot; and &quot;vocês&quot; are always accompanied by 3rd-person verb forms (e.g. &quot;você é&quot;, &quot;vocês são&quot;), whereas &quot;tu&quot; requires 2nd-person verb forms (e.g. &quot;tu és&quot;). However, in &quot;tuteante&quot; BP dialects like gaúcho, &quot;tu&quot; is almost always accompanied by 3rd-person verb forms, e.g. &quot;tu é&quot;, &quot;tu bebeu&quot; vs. standard &quot;tu és&quot;, &quot;tu bebeste&quot;. That particular usage is considered ungrammatical by most Brazilian speakers whose dialects do not include &quot;tu&quot; (e.g. &quot;paulistanos&quot;).

The &quot;você&quot; (subj.) / &quot;te&quot; (obj.) combination, e.g. &quot;Você sabe que eu te amo&quot;, is a well-known peculiarity of modern General Brazilian Portuguese and is similar in nature to the &quot;vocês&quot; (subj.) / &quot;vos&quot; (obj.) / &quot;vosso&quot; (poss.) combination found in modern colloquial European Portuguese. Both combinations would be condemned, though, by prescriptive school grammars based on the classical language.

When Brazilians use &quot;tu&quot;, it is mostly accompanied by the 3rd-person verb conjugation: &quot;Tu vai ao banco?&quot; — &quot;Will you go to the bank?&quot; (&quot;Tu vai&quot; is wrong according to the standard grammar, yet is still used by many Brazilians). The pronoun &quot;tu&quot; accompanied by the second-person verb can still be found in Maranhão, Piauí, Pernambuco (mostly in more formal speech) and Santa Catarina, for instance, and in a few cities in Rio Grande do Sul near the border with Uruguay, with a slightly different pronunciation in some conjugations (&quot;tu vieste&quot; — &quot;you came&quot; — is pronounced as if it were &quot;tu viesse&quot;), which also is present in Santa Catarina and Pernambuco (especially in Recife, where it is by far the predominant way to pronounce the past tense particle &quot;-ste&quot;).

====&quot;O(s)&quot; and &quot;a(s)&quot;====
In Brazil, the weak clitic pronouns &quot;-o(s)&quot; and &quot;-a(s)&quot; are used &quot;almost exclusively&quot; in writing or in formal speech (e.g. TV newscasts). In colloquial speech, &quot;ele(s)&quot; and &quot;ela(s)&quot; replace the clitics as direct objects (e.g. &quot;Vi eles na praia ontem&quot; versus &quot;Vi-os na praia ontem&quot;; in English, &quot;I saw them on the beach yesterday&quot;). The standard written variants &quot;-lo(s)&quot; and &quot;-la(s)&quot; (used after an infinitive ending in &quot;r&quot;) are more frequent though in the speech of polite speakers, but seem to be losing ground as well. Note, however, that &quot;ele(s)&quot; or &quot;ela(s)&quot; are never used as direct objects in formal writing, such as newspaper articles, academic papers, or legal documents. The use of &quot;-lo&quot;, &quot;-la&quot;, etc. replacing &quot;você&quot; as direct object is restricted mostly to the written language (in particular, movie subtitles) although it occurs frequently in a few fixed expressions like &quot;Prazer em conhecê-lo&quot; (&quot;Pleased to meet you&quot;) or &quot;Posso ajudá-lo?&quot; (&quot;May I help you?&quot;).

====&quot;Lhe(s)&quot;====
The use of &quot;lhe&quot; and &quot;lhes&quot; as indirect object forms of &quot;você&quot; and &quot;vocês&quot; (&quot;[to] you&quot;, plural and singular) is currently rare in General BP, where &quot;lhe&quot; is often replaced as noted above by &quot;te&quot; or, alternatively, by &quot;para você&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;lheísmo&quot;, i.e. the use of &quot;lhe&quot; not only as an indirect object (e.g. &quot;Eu lhe dou meu endereço&quot;, &quot;I will give you my address&quot;), but also as a &quot;direct object&quot; (e.g. &quot;Eu lhe vi na praia ontem&quot;, Eng. &quot;I saw you at the beach yesterday&quot;) is frequent in Northeastern Brazilian dialects, especially in Bahia.

In standard written BP, it is common to use &quot;lhe(s)&quot; as indirect object forms of &quot;ele(s)/ela(s)&quot; (&quot;[to] him / her / it / them&quot;), e.g. &quot;O presidente pediu que lhe dessem notícias da crise na Bolívia&quot;. In the colloquial language, &#x27;lhe&#x27; in that context is frequently replaced by &quot;para ele&quot;, etc., although educated speakers might use &quot;lhe&quot; in speech as well.

====Replacement of object pronouns with subject pronouns====
In nonstandard BP, especially in regional dialects like caipira, object pronouns may be avoided altogether, even in the first person. For example: &quot;Ele levou nós no baile&quot; (standard BP &quot;Ele nos levou ao baile&quot;) or &quot;Ela viu eu na escola&quot; (standard BP &quot;Ela me viu na escola&quot;). These examples, although common in rural areas and in working-class speech, would sound ungrammatical to most urban middle-class BP speakers in formal situations.

<text>Flash Comics is a comics anthology published by All-American Publications and later by National Periodical Publications (DC Comics). The title had 104 issues published from January 1940 to February 1949. Despite the title, the anthology featured the adventures of multiple superheroes in addition to Jay Garrick, the original Flash. Characters introduced in the series include the Flash, Hawkman (Carter Hall), Hawkgirl and Black Canary.

==Publication history==
The series debuted with a January 1940 cover date, while initially published on November 20, 1939. The first issue featured the first appearances of the Golden Age versions of the Flash, Hawkman, and Johnny Thunder. The Flash was later given a solo comic book series, &quot;All-Flash&quot; which ran for 32 issues between Summer 1941 to January 1948.

Artist Joe Kubert&#x27;s long association with the Hawkman character began with the story &quot;The Painter and the $100,000&quot; in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #62 (Feb. 1945). The Monocle was introduced in #64 as a new foe for Hawkman.

Carmine Infantino&#x27;s first published work for DC was &quot;The Black Canary&quot;, a six-page Johnny Thunder story in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #86 (August 1947) that introduced the superheroine the Black Canary. Writer Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert created the Thorn in issue #89 (November 1947).

&quot;Flash Comics&quot; was cancelled in 1949 with issue #104. The series&#x27; numbering would be continued by the first volume of &quot;The Flash&quot; series, which debuted during the Silver Age in 1959 and featured Barry Allen as the new Flash.

<text>Mandalay Resort Group (formerly Circus Circus Enterprises) was an American hotel and casino operator based in Paradise, Nevada. Its major properties included Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and Circus Circus, as well as half of the Monte Carlo. In terms of market capitalization, it was one of the largest casino operators in the world. Its stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol &quot;CIR&quot; and &quot;MBG&quot;.

==History==
The company&#x27;s longtime name originated with the Circus Circus casino, opened by Jay Sarno in 1968. The company was incorporated in 1974, as Circo Resorts Inc., owned by casino executives William Bennett and William Pennington. Circo was formed to take over management of Circus Circus, and the company would take ownership nearly a decade later. In 1978, Circo Resorts was renamed Circus Circus Hotels Inc., after the opening of Circus Circus Reno.

The company purchased the Silver City Casino and Slots-A-Fun Casino in 1979 for $30 million, then refurbished both the interior and exterior.

The company went public in 1983, as Circus Circus Enterprises, and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company&#x27;s properties found success in the 1980s offering a Las Vegas experience to families subsequently experimented upon by its competitors. Its converted Circus Circus (originally developed for the upmarket) and later Excalibur properties offered gaming opportunities for adults and separate non-gambling games and theme-park-style experiences for underage visitors under the same roof.

In 1983, Circus Circus purchased the Edgewater Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada for $17 million. The next year, the company bought the neighboring Colorado Belle casino from Advanced Patent Technology and John Fulton for $4 million. The company planned to move the unprofitable Colorado Belle to make room for an expansion of the Edgewater.

The group subsequently developed the Excalibur in 1990, the Luxor in 1993 and the Mandalay Bay in 1999 for which the group was renamed.

The group entered into a joint venture in 1993 with Don Carano of Eldorado in Reno to develop and build Reno&#x27;s largest and tallest megaresort titled Silver Legacy. The $350 million hotel opened on July 28, 1995. Circus Circus Enterprises held a majority stake in that Reno resort.

Circus Circus Tunica opened on August 29, 1994. It was rebranded in 1997 as Gold Strike Tunica and given a more upscale theme. The total cost for the remodel was estimated to be $125 million.

On March 20, 1995, Circus Circus Enterprises announced that it had agreed to acquire Gold Strike Resorts, a closely held budget casino owner and operator based in Jean, Nevada, in a deal valued at more than $600 million. At the time of the acquisition, Gold Strike Resorts owned the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall, Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino, Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino and 50% of the under-construction Monte Carlo Resort and Casino. The acquisition did not include the original Gold Strike near Boulder City, because the owners wanted to pass it on to their children.

In 1995, Circus Circus purchased the Hacienda from Archon Corporation. By this time, the Hacienda was dwarfed by the many new megaresorts that were being built, in particular the Luxor, which had just been recently completed. On December 10, 1996, the Hacienda was closed to the public after 40 years, and imploded later that month. This implosion was broadcast on the Fox Network as a part of their New Year&#x27;s Eve 1996 telecast. Despite the implosion, parts of the old resort still stood, due to the building not falling into its footprint, but toppling into its parking lot. The next day a wrecking crew was brought in to bring down the remaining parts. In March 1999, it was replaced by the Mandalay Bay.

The group was also a partner with Mirage Resorts on the 1996 opening of the nearby Monte Carlo Resort and Casino.

Circus Circus Enterprises closed the Silver City Casino on October 31, 1999.

Following the completion of Mandalay Bay in 1999, the name of the company was changed to Mandalay Resorts Group.

On December 14, 1999, MotorCity Casino Hotel opened.

On May 23, 2002, the Mandalay Resort Group announced a second 1,122-room hotel tower at their Mandalay Bay property, with a cost of at least $200 million. Construction began on the tower in September 2002. The name of the tower, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, was chosen in September 2003. The tower opened on December 17, 2003.

On June 4, 2004, one of Mandalay&#x27;s largest competitors, MGM Mirage, announced a bid to acquire it for $68 per share plus assumption of debt. Although the proposal was announced after the stock market closed, the volume of trading in Mandalay stock on that day was quadruple the normal, with the stock closing at $60.27 per share. The ensuing negotiations between the two companies included at one point an announcement that the Mandalay board was rejecting the offer because of antitrust concerns. On June 15, 2004, however, both companies&#x27; boards approved a revised offer of $71 per share. The agreement called for MGM Mirage to pay $4.8 billion and to assume $2.5 billion in debt. The transaction was completed on April 25, 2005 for $7.9 billion.

MGM executives were confident that antitrust regulators would not require the sale of any of the two companies&#x27; properties. Michigan law, however, forbade one company from owning multiple casinos, requiring the sale of either the MGM Grand Detroit or Mandalay&#x27;s 54% stake in the MotorCity Casino. After some vacillation about which property to sell, Mandalay accepted a $525-million offer for its interest in MotorCity from Marian Ilitch, the casino&#x27;s second largest shareholder.

<text>The Columbia River drainage basin is the drainage basin of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It covers . In common usage, the term often refers to a smaller area, generally the portion of the drainage basin that lies within eastern Washington.

Usage of the term &quot;Columbia Basin&quot; in British Columbia generally refers only to the immediate basins of the Columbia and Kootenay Rivers and excludes that of the Okanagan, Kettle and Similkameen Rivers.

== Description ==
The Columbia Basin includes the southeastern portion of the Canadian province of British Columbia, most of the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, the western part of Montana, and very small portions of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. The south and southeastern drainage divide borders the interior drainage of the northern Great Basin. To the northeast the region borders the basins of the Saskatchewan River (Hudson Bay) and the Mackenzie River (Beaufort Sea), and to the northwest the basin of the Fraser River. The Columbia Basin extends from the Rocky Mountains in the east through the Cascade Range to the Columbia River&#x27;s outflow at the Pacific Ocean in the west.

The Columbia River pours more water into the Pacific Ocean than any other river in North or South America. In its course to the Pacific Ocean, the Columbia flows through four mountain ranges—the Rockies, Selkirks, Cascades, and coastal mountains—and drains . The mainstem of the Columbia rises in Columbia Lake on the west slope of the Rocky Mountain Range in Canada. Its largest tributary, the Snake, travels from its source in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming before joining the Columbia. 

=== Washington region ===
Residents of the area surrounding the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers—a region centering on the Tri-Cities, Washington metropolitan area—use the term &quot;Columbia Basin&quot; to refer to their own, much smaller region. This usage is roughly synonymous with the Columbia Plateau or roughly equivalent to the relatively unforested area bounded by the Cascades, Blue, Wallowa, and Rocky mountain ranges and the Okanagan Highland. This sense of the term Columbia Basin has expanded from its early focus on the land irrigated by Grand Coulee Dam and the Columbia Basin Project to include other irrigation districts such as the Yakima and Walla Walla valleys. The area includes valuable farmland that has excellent soil profile and underlying silty loess. At its center is the Pasco Basin, an area roughly double the size of, and fully containing, the Hanford Site.

==History==
When Lewis and Clark explored the region in the early 19th century, huge numbers of fish (salmon) returned to spawn every year. &quot;The multitudes of this fish are almost inconceivable,&quot; Clark wrote in the autumn of 1805. At that time, the Columbia and its tributaries provided of pristine river habitat. In the early 20th century, the government and private interests began constructing dams on the tributaries of the Columbia River to provide water for irrigation or flood control. The federal dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers devastated salmon runs, inundated Columbia River Basin Tribes villages and burial grounds, and deprived tribal members of the ability to exercise traditional ways of life.

<doc id="699849" wikidata="Q977275" url="?curid=699849" title="Gens du pays">
<text>&quot;Gens du pays&quot; is a Quebecois song that has been called the unofficial national anthem of Quebec. Written by poet and singer-songwriter Gilles Vigneault, and with music co-written by Gaston Rochon, it was first performed by Vigneault on June 24, 1975 during a concert on Montreal&#x27;s Mount Royal at that year&#x27;s Fête nationale du Québec ceremony. It quickly became a folk classic, and it has been played frequently at Fête nationale ceremonies since then. The chorus is by far the most famous part of the song: &quot;Gens du pays, c&#x27;est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d&#x27;amour&quot;, which, translated, says, &quot;Folks of the land, it is your turn to let yourselves speak of love.&quot;

The song is also associated with the Quebec sovereignty movement and the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, which use it as a sort of anthem. A famous instance of this took place at René Lévesque&#x27;s concession speech after the citizens of the province rejected independence in the 1980 Quebec referendum. At the end of Lévesque&#x27;s speech, the crowd assembled to hear him speak stood up and sang &quot;Gens du pays&quot;, which Lévesque called &quot;the most beautiful Québécois song in the minds of all Quebecers.&quot;

== Birthday adaptation ==
In Quebec, a modified version of the chorus is often sung to celebrate a person, for example on a birthday (in the specific case of the birthday, the idea was explicitly introduced by Vigneault, Yvon Deschamps and Louise Forestier at the song&#x27;s 1975 introduction):

:&quot;Mon cher ami&quot; (or &quot;Ma chère amie&quot;)&quot;, c&#x27;est à ton tour&quot;
:&quot;De te laisser parler d&#x27;amour.&quot;

(&quot;My dear friend, it&#x27;s your turn / To let yourself be lovingly spoken to.&quot;)

Alternatively, &quot;ami(e)&quot; (friend) is replaced with the name of the person being celebrated.

For instance, at René Lévesque&#x27;s funeral, mourners outside the church broke out singing &quot;Mon cher René, c&#x27;est à ton tour de te laisser parler d&#x27;amour.&quot;

The birthday adaptation uses the familiar, informal and singular &quot;tu&quot; form of French personal pronouns, in contrast with the original which uses &quot;vous&quot; pronouns, which are either singular but formal, or plural (as with other Romance languages such as Spanish).

<text>Framheim was the name of explorer Roald Amundsen&#x27;s base at the Bay of Whales on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica during his successful quest for the South Pole. It was used between January 1911 and February 1912.

== Cabin and tents ==

The hut was constructed in sections by a master carpenter, Jørgen Stubberud and erected at Amundsen&#x27;s home in Norway, then dismantled for shipment to Antarctica on the &quot;Fram&quot;. Framheim literally means &quot;home of the Fram&quot;. During its construction in Norway, Amundsen maintained that the hut was for &quot;observation&quot;, which would fit in nicely with his supposed intent to head to the North Pole. To the more than casual student of exploration, it was obvious that the hut was intended as living quarters. Amundsen was headed to the South Pole.

The cabin was an early example of a pre-fabricated structure, and employed a custom dining table which could retract to the ceiling for cleaning beneath. It measured eight by four meters, and the walls were made up of four layers of three one inch wood lumber with cardboard between for insulation.
During the long Antarctic winter, Amundsen and the members of his expedition constructed a network of workshops and storage rooms, including a steam-bath room, carved out of the ice surrounding the main hut. In this complex the men busied themselves in preparing for the upcoming journey to the South Pole.

Amundsen spurned the traditional white tent, and instead dyed his tent material black. He stated that this was to serve three purposes: First, black would absorb what little solar radiation would fall upon the tent. Second, a black tent would provide the best possible contrast against the endless snow and ice if one became lost. And finally, the black provided a rest for the eyes. In addition, the square, pyramid-style tent was equipped with a single central pole that was lashed to one of the sledges in its full length during travel, avoiding the need to assemble tent-poles and making the job of pitching the tent very simple and quick. The tent also featured a sewn-in floor, which was an innovation several years ahead of its time.

== Equipment ==
At Framheim, Amundsen continually upgraded his equipment, since he was largely dissatisfied with standard polar gear. The sledges were refined by shaving down portions of their frames and runners, achieving a 60% weight reduction without compromising their overall strength.
Amundsen designed special sledge-cases for food and equipment that remained permanently lashed to the sledges, with access through a lid that could easily be pried off without the need to remove mitts. This saved the time of unloading and re-loading packing boxes when making and breaking camp while on the march, and also eliminated the risk of frostbite when unpacking the sledges. The sledge-cases were also refined during the winter by planing down the wood to reduce their weight. Further, food selection and packing had been refined for both efficiency and maximum space usage. Amundsen brought only four foods: pemmican (made according to his own recipe), chocolate, milk powder and biscuits, although this diet was supplemented by seal and penguin meat stored in the supply depots on the Barrier, and by fresh dog-meat from the dogs that they culled during the journey. This fresh, vitamin-rich meat in their diet prevented the onset of scurvy.

To prepare for the trip to the pole, the ski bindings were fitted with hooks so they could be removed during sleeping hours and hung inside the tent. Since the bindings were made of leather, the ravenous sledge dogs would often gnaw at them when the men were asleep. Footwear and the risk of frostbite was a major concern for Amundsen, especially after some negative experiences during the autumn depot-laying trips and the abortive first attempt to reach the Pole. He and his men re-constructed and refined their ski-boots several times before the final polar journey, to obtain maximum insulation against the cold and to provide the necessary flexibility for skiing. Each man brought spare boots in case of breakage or malfunction, with the risk of debilitating frostbite outweighing the issue of weight. None of Amundsen&#x27;s men experienced frostbitten feet during the polar journey, despite the extreme temperatures.

== Fate of the base ==
The Polar Party returned to Framheim on 25 January 1912 and left in the Fram on 30 January after &quot;two days of bustle in getting on board the things we were (to) take with us&quot;. They left behind the buried hut &quot;that strong little house that now lay entirely hidden beneath the snow behind Mount Nelson&quot; and doubtless many artefacts. The site on the eastern flank of the Bay of Whales was used extensively in the 1930s by a series of American expeditions led by Richard E. Byrd. They established bases somewhat to the north of Framheim - Little America I to III. There is, however, apparently no definite evidence that the original Framheim hut was rediscovered, possibly because it was deeply buried. Sometime between 1957 and 1962 calving of the Ross Ice Shelf resulted in the block on which Framheim and the Little America bases were sited being detached from the barrier ice. The floe then probably drifted west and progressively broke up along the edge of the Ross Barrier.

<text>Hawkworld is a comic book series published by American company DC Comics from 1989 to 1993. The initial storyline was published as a three-issue mini-series and then, based on the high sales and interest level generated by this limited series, launched as an ongoing monthly book. Katar Hol and Shayera Thal were rebooted in the prestige format limited series.

==Publication history==
The three-issue limited series written and drawn by Timothy Truman and inked by Enrique Alcatena was published in 1989. The ongoing series lasted for four years (1990–1993) and included 32 issues, along with 3 annuals. Timothy Truman contributed to the plotting of the first six issues, which were scripted by John Ostrander. Ostrander was the sole credited writer for the remainder of the series. After the &quot;Hawkworld&quot; ongoing series ended in 1993, a new series simply named &quot;Hawkman&quot; (vol. 3) picked up the story line and ran from 1993 to 1996. Ostrander wrote the first six issues of this new series, tying up some dangling plot threads from &quot;Hawkworld&quot;.

==Plot==
Katar Hol was a young police officer on the planet Thanagar, and a child of a privileged family. But his homeworld had the policy to conquer and mine other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realized that this was wrong. He rebelled against the system, and was sent into exile. 10 years later, he escaped and got the help of Shayera Thal, a young officer from a lower class of society, to uncover and defeat the renegade police captain Byth. As a result, Hol was reinstated in the Wingmen Force and given a new partner, Thal.

==Themes==

The primary themes Timothy Truman focused on in the limited series were social inequality and class. When John Ostrander took over the writing duties with the monthly series he continued to develop and expand upon Truman&#x27;s original ideas. After relocating the setting of the series from Thanagar to the city of Chicago, Katar and Shayera were exposed to the founding documents of the United States as part of their education on America&#x27;s criminal justice system. Neither characters were familiar with the concept of natural rights and found the contrasts between America&#x27;s founding principles and the reality of pragmatic governance perplexing. Their different ways of coming to terms with these ideas and the possibility of spreading them back to their home world drove the story lines of the series. Katar was inspired by the possibilities he found in this new way of thinking while Shayera initially rejected them as unrealistic and unworkable. During the series both characters eventually concluded that, much like Thanagar, the United States was also a &quot;Hawkworld&quot;, a predatory society in which the powerful oppress the weak; despite this, they came to see American society as offering more long-term hope for social justice through its embrace of natural rights, even if these values were only embraced on a rhetorical level by most.

==Continuity==
Along with its contemporaries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Aquaman Special&quot; #1, and &quot;Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn&quot;, &quot;Hawkworld&quot; was intended to revise DC Universe continuity for the post-Crisis continuity that explored the origins of the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman. However, DC editors decided that it was not just an origin story; rather, it was occurring in the present, concurrently with the rest of DC&#x27;s output (similar to &quot;Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals&quot; and &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot;). This meant that the Hawks&#x27; entire history from the Silver Age onward had to be disregarded, including their memberships in the Justice League (including his brief membership in Justice League International). This began a series of retcons to the Hawkman characters that ended with a new Hawkman returning in the pages of &quot;JSA&quot;.

During the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline (2010), Hath-Set has collected the bones from all of Carter&#x27;s and Shiera&#x27;s past bodies and created from them a portal to Hawkworld. He was followed, however, by Carter and Shiera. While there, it is revealed that Hawkworld is now under the rulership of Shiera&#x27;s mother, Queen Khea. There is also a tribe of creatures that resemble Lion-Mane living on Hawkworld.

<text>A Kitchen Cabinet is a group of unofficial or private advisers to a political leader. The term was originally used by political opponents of President of the United States Andrew Jackson to describe his ginger group, the collection of unofficial advisors he consulted in parallel to the United States Cabinet (the &quot;parlor cabinet&quot;) following his purge of the cabinet at the end of the Eaton affair and his break with Vice President John C. Calhoun in 1831. 

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says that the term is &quot;In early use depreciative, with the implication that the group wields undue influence&quot;. Its illustrative quotations show the term in use in American sources from 1832, in a British source referring to American politics in 1952, in relation to British politics in 1969, and in an American source discussing Israeli politics in 2006. 

==Background==
Secretary of State Martin Van Buren was a widower, and since he had no wife to become involved in the Eaton controversy, he managed to avoid becoming entangled himself. In 1831 he resigned his cabinet post, as did Secretary of War John Eaton, in order to give Jackson a reason to re-order his cabinet and dismiss Calhoun allies. Jackson then dismissed Calhounites Samuel D. Ingham, John Branch, and John M. Berrien. Van Buren, whom Jackson had already indicated he wanted to run for vice president in 1832, remained in Washington as a member of the Kitchen Cabinet until he was appointed as Minister to Great Britain. Eaton was subsequently appointed Governor of Florida Territory.

Jackson&#x27;s Kitchen Cabinet included his longtime political allies Martin Van Buren, Francis Preston Blair, Amos Kendall, William B. Lewis, Andrew Jackson Donelson, John Overton, Isaac Hill, and Roger B. Taney. As newspapermen, Blair and Kendall were given particular notice by rival papers.

Blair was Kendall&#x27;s successor as editor of the Jacksonian &quot;Argus of Western America&quot;, the prominent pro-New Court newspaper of Kentucky. Jackson brought Blair to Washington, D.C. to counter Calhounite Duff Green, editor of &quot;The United States Telegraph&quot;, with a new paper, the &quot;Globe&quot;. Lewis had been quartermaster under Jackson during the War of 1812; Andrew Donelson was Jackson&#x27;s adoptive son and private secretary; and Overton was Andrew Jackson&#x27;s friend and business partner since the 1790s.

== Coinage ==
The first known appearance of the term is in correspondence by Bank of the United States head Nicholas Biddle, who wrote of the presidential advisors that &quot;the kitchen ... predominate[s] over the Parlor.&quot;

U.S. Senator George Poindexter, who had previously been cordial with Jackson, began criticizing his choice of advisors in August 1831, writing that Jackson &quot;lends his ear too readily to individuals near his person, who are incompetent to advise him, and unworthy of public confidence.&quot; The first appearance of &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; in publication was by Poindexter in an article in the Calhounite &quot;Telegraph&quot; of March 13, 1832, defending his vote against Van Buren as minister to Great Britain:

The President&#x27;s press, edited under his own eye, by a &#x27;pair of deserters from the Clay party&#x27; [Kendall and Blair] and a few others, familiarly known by the appellation of the &#x27;Kitchen Cabinet,&#x27; is made the common reservoir of all the petty slanders which find a place in the most degraded prints of the Union.Jackson&#x27;s originally kitchen cabinet was not a team of rivals or a loosely organized brain trust but a cohort of loyalists and &quot;patronage dispensers&quot; who, according to historian Daniel Walker Howe, &quot;performed only such functions as the president directed...an informal, flexible group of advisors with no power base other than his favor suited his executive style, allowing him to keep power in his own hands, and, as historian Richard Latner has pointed out, &#x27;to dominate his surroundings.&#x27;&quot; According to historian Louis Harlan, Jackson did not trust &quot;professional, compromising politicians, and always surrounded himself with amateur politicians of the subservient, personally loyal variety.&quot; The domestic implication of the name &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; may be related to the fact that many of his advisors, for instance William B. Lewis and John H. Eaton, had either long-standing personal ties to Jackson.

==Uses in government==

===Australia===
Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s reliance on a kitchen cabinet (Treasurer Wayne Swan, Rudd&#x27;s successor Julia Gillard and Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner) was a factor in his removal as PM.

Starting February 2012, &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; is a TV entertainment series hosted by political commentator Annabel Crabb, in which she interviews notable Australian politicians while preparing and sharing meals with them.

===Canada===
During the negotiations preceding the 1982 patriation of the Constitution of Canada, the crucial agreement to create the notwithstanding clause was reached during a meeting between one federal and two provincial justice ministers in the actual kitchen of the Government Conference Centre in Ottawa. That agreement became known as the Kitchen Accord and its authors, Jean Chrétien from the federal government, Roy Romanow from Saskatchewan, and Roy McMurtry from Ontario, became known as the Kitchen Cabinet.

===India===
In India, the quasi-governmental body formerly headed by Sonia Gandhi, called the National Advisory Council, was often referred to as a &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; by the media and general public, although the government at that time was headed by Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister.

===Israel===
In Israel, the term &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; is commonly used to translate the Hebrew term (&quot;HaMitbahon&quot; or &quot;HaMitbachon&quot;), which more literally translates to &quot;the kitchenette&quot;. The term refers to a subset of the Security Cabinet of Israel comprising the Prime Minister&#x27;s most trusted advisors and derives from former Prime Minister Golda Meir&#x27;s habit of hosting meetings of her inner circle of ministers at home over cake she had baked personally. While subsequent Prime Ministers have not generally maintained the tradition of literally cooking for their ministers, the sense of an intimate group of trusted advisors has remained current since Meir&#x27;s premiership.

===United Kingdom===
The term was introduced to British politics to describe British Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s inner circle during his terms of office (1964-1970 and 1974–1976); prior to Tony Blair, Wilson was the longest-serving Labour Party Prime Minister. Members included Marcia Williams, George Wigg, Joe Haines, and Bernard Donoughue. The term has been used subsequently, especially under Tony Blair, for the sidelining of traditional democratic cabinet structures to rely far more on a close group of non-elected advisors and allies. Examples of this practice include Blair&#x27;s reliance on advisor Andrew Adonis before his appointment to the cabinet.

===United States===
In colloquial U.S. usage, &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; refers to any group of trusted friends and associates, particularly in reference to a president&#x27;s or presidential candidate&#x27;s closest unofficial advisers.

* Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s variant was called the &quot;tennis cabinet&quot;. These group of friends, diplomats and informal advisors would actually accompany the president and play tennis regularly on the lawn outside the White House.
* Clark Clifford was considered a member of the kitchen cabinet for John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson before he was appointed Secretary of Defense. Robert F. Kennedy was uniquely considered to be a kitchen cabinet member as well as a Cabinet member while he was his brother&#x27;s Attorney General.
* Gerald Ford had a kitchen cabinet while vice president, which he continued to seek advice from after he assumed the presidency in August 1974. The group included Melvin Laird, Bryce Harlow, William Scranton, Robert Griffin, and Donald Rumsfeld.
* Ronald Reagan had a kitchen cabinet of allies and friends from California who advised him during his terms. This group of ten to twelve businessmen were all strong proponents of the free enterprise system. His California backers included Karl Bendetsen, Alfred Bloomingdale, Earl Brian, Justin Whitlock Dart, William French Smith, Charles Wick, oilman William A. Wilson, auto dealer Holmes Tuttle, beer baron Joseph Coors, steel magnate and philanthropist Earle Jorgensen, and about three to five others including Samuel Stuart Bretzfield. Coors was the major funder and most active participant. He also funded many think tanks and policy institutes at about this time, including The Heritage Foundation.

==Uses in business==

Lisa Yoon extends use of the term &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot; to &quot;a network of trusted advisers&quot; who influence the decisions of corporate presidents and potentates.

<text>Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Rudolph Wills (18 September 1928 – 1992) was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guyana from 1975 to 1978. He was a renowned statesman, lawyer, cricket expert and intellectual. Wills is cited for his intellectual and academic genius by oral stories from his fellow-Guyanese and globally.

== Education and career in England ==
Fred Wills studied law at King&#x27;s College London, where he was awarded the Jelf Medal for his outstanding academic success as a law graduate. He was also named to Queen&#x27;s Counsel, the highest level of judges in England. However, he never practised as a judge in England, instead returning to Guyana.

== Return to Guyana ==
When he returned to Guyana, he became famous for being one of the top legal minds in Guyana, while also contributing to developing the law and constitution in Guyana. When the Guyanese president Forbes Burnham came into power he appointed Wills as Justice Minister and later Foreign Affairs Minister. In that capacity Wills briefly presided over the United Nations Security Council and twice addressed the General Assembly, once on independence for East Timor and once on 27 September 1976, to promote a Third World debt moratorium.

== Move to the United States ==
Wills&#x27;s government service ended in 1978 and he moved to the United States. There, he became a professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey and an associate of Lyndon LaRouche, although he later distanced himself from LaRouche and from LaRouche&#x27;s wife, Helga Zepp-LaRouche. He was a founding board member of the Schiller Institute in 1984.

== Personal life ==
Fred Wills was married to Doris Harper-Wills, whom he divorced and later remarried. He served as club captain for the Demerara Cricket Club (DCC) in Georgetown, Guyana, and was a popular radio announcer at cricket games and for the programme &quot;Fred Wills on Sport&quot; transmitted in the Caribbean region. In the U.S., Guyanese cricket fans have proposed renaming the DCC Pavilion as &quot;Fred Wills Pavilion&quot;.

Wills died in New Jersey in 1992.

<text>Olav Bjaaland (5 March 1873 – 8 June 1961) was a Norwegian ski champion and polar explorer. In 1911, he was one of the first five men to reach the South Pole as part of Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition.

== Biography ==
Olav Olavsen Bjaaland was born on the Søndre Bjaaland farm at Morgedal in Telemark, Norway. At the turn of the century, Bjaaland, together with the Hemmestveit brothers were among the best skiers in Norway. In 1902, he won the nordic combined at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival, to this day the classic event in nordic skiing. In 1909 Bjaaland, together with five others were invited to France to compete with the best skiers of Europe.

On this trip, Bjaaland by chance met Roald Amundsen. The already successful explorer invited Bjaaland to join his forthcoming expedition to the North Pole. Bjaaland was thrilled, and still believing that they were heading to the North Pole. However, they left Oslo, Norway on 7 June 1910 heading south to race for the Antarctic pole against Robert Falcon Scott.
Bjaaland was a skilled carpenter, and on the trip he managed to reduce the prefabricated sledges bought in Oslo (Scott had bought the same type of sledges for his expedition, although never modified them) from 88 kg to 22 kg, without reducing their strength notably. On the actual sledge journey from the Bay of Whales to the pole and return, Bjaaland was often used as a forerunner so that the dogs had something to run after. He was known for being able to ski such that the traces he made formed almost perfect straight lines in the terrain. After returning from the successful conquest of the pole, Amundsen asked Bjaaland to go north with him to explore the Northeast Passage, but he turned down the offer.

In later years Bjaaland went back to Telemark and set up a successful ski manufacturing workshop with money lent from Amundsen. In 1961, Bjaaland died peacefully at age 88; of the five to reach the South Pole, he lived the longest, and was the only one to witness the advances made by the IGY in Antarctica, including the construction of the permanent South Pole base named Amundsen–Scott in honor of his expedition leader.

The Bjaaland Museum in Telemark, Norway has a small collection of photographs and other memorabilia from the South Pole expedition.

==Awards==
*In 1912, he was awarded the South Pole Medal (&quot;Sydpolsmedaljen&quot;), a Royal Norwegian award instituted by King Haakon VII in 1912 to reward participants in Roald Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition.
*In 1912, Bjaaland was awarded the Holmenkollen medal (&quot;Holmenkollmedaljen&quot;), the Norwegian highest competitive award for skiing.
*In 1952, at Morgedal, Bjaaland lit the torch for the 1952 Winter Olympics.
*In 2021, Håkon Anton Fagerås created a statue in bronze of Bjaaland commissioned by the Fram museum in Oslo in honor of Bjaaland.

<doc id="699883" wikidata="Q833053" url="?curid=699883" title="Subject (music)">
<text>In music, a subject is the material, usually a recognizable melody, upon which part or all of a composition is based. In forms other than the fugue, this may be known as the theme.

==Characteristics==
A subject may be perceivable as a complete musical expression in itself, separate from the work in which it is found. In contrast to an idea or motif, a subject is usually a complete phrase or period. The &quot;Encyclopédie Fasquelle&quot; defines a theme (subject) as &quot;[a]ny element, motif, or small musical piece that has given rise to some variation becomes thereby a theme&quot;.

Thematic changes and processes are often structurally important, and theorists such as Rudolph Reti have created analysis from a purely thematic perspective. Fred Lerdahl describes thematic relations as &quot;associational&quot; and thus outside his cognitive-based generative theory&#x27;s scope of analysis.

==In different types of music==

Music based on a single theme is called monothematic, while music based on several themes is called polythematic. Most fugues are monothematic and most pieces in sonata form are polythematic. In the exposition of a fugue, the principal theme (usually called the subject) is announced successively in each voice – sometimes in a transposed form.

In some compositions, a principal subject is announced and then a second melody, sometimes called a countersubject or secondary theme, may occur. When one of the sections in the exposition of a sonata-form movement consists of several themes or other material, defined by function and (usually) their tonality, rather than by melodic characteristics alone, the term theme group (or subject group) is sometimes used.

Music without subjects/themes, or without recognizable, repeating, and developing subjects/themes, is called athematic. Examples include the pre-twelve-tone or early atonal works of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, and Alois Hába. Schoenberg once said that, &quot;intoxicated by the enthusiasm of having freed music from the shackles of tonality, I had thought to find further liberty of expression. In fact, I … believed that now music could renounce motivic features and remain coherent and comprehensible nevertheless&quot;. Examples by Schoenberg include &quot;Erwartung&quot;. Examples in the works of later composers include &quot;Polyphonie X&quot; and &quot;Structures I&quot; by Pierre Boulez, Sonata for Two Pianos by Karel Goeyvaerts, and &quot;Punkte&quot; by Karlheinz Stockhausen.

==Countersubject==

In a fugue, when the first voice has completed the subject, and the second voice is playing the answer, the first voice usually continues by playing a new theme that is called the &#x27;countersubject&#x27;. The countersubject usually contrasts with the subject/answer phrase shape.

In a fugue, a countersubject is &quot;the continuation of counterpoint in the voice that began with the subject&quot;, occurring against the answer. It is not usually regarded as an essential feature of fugue, however.

The typical fugue opening resembles the following:
 Soprano voice: Answer 
 Alto voice: Subject Countersubject
Since a countersubject may be used both above and below the answer, countersubjects are usually invertible, all perfect fifths inverting to perfect fourths which required resolution.

<text>The Civic Forum (Czech: &quot;Občanské fórum&quot;, OF) was a political movement in the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, established during the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The corresponding movement in Slovakia was called Public Against Violence (Slovak: &quot;Verejnosť proti násiliu&quot; - VPN).

The Civic Forum&#x27;s purpose was to unify the dissident forces in Czechoslovakia and to overthrow the Communist regime. In this, they succeeded when the Communists gave up power in November 1989 after only 10 days of protests. Playwright Václav Havel, its leader and founder, was elected president on December 29, 1989. Although the Forum did not have a clear political strategy beyond the June 1990 elections, it campaigned successfully in March and April 1990 during the first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1946. Those elections garnered Civic Forum 36 percent of the vote, the highest that a Czechoslovakian party ever obtained in a free election. This netted it 68 seats in the Chamber of Deputies; combined with Public Against Violence&#x27;s 19 seats, it commanded a strong majority.

The Civic Forum had a very loose structure, and most of its (self-appointed) leaders came from Prague-based members of the Charter 77 dissident movement. In December 1989, Jan Urban became the Forum&#x27;s chairman after Havel&#x27;s election as president. Urban served until June 1990, when he resigned, stating he did not want a rift between the organization and the president. On October 16, 1990, Václav Klaus was elected its new chairman. Klaus&#x27;s policies were opposed by other leading figures within the Forum and party unity soon vanished.

At the Civic Forum congress in January 1991, the movement divided. The more right wing members, led by Klaus, declared that they would form an independent party, the Civic Democratic Party (&quot;Občanská demokratická strana&quot;), with a clearer program advocating a free market. The party elected Klaus as its chairman in February 1991. The more centrist members of Civic Forum, led by federal minister of foreign affairs Jiří Dienstbier, formed the Civic Movement (&quot;Občanské hnutí&quot;). Klaus stated that the two parties would rule as a coalition until the 1992 elections. However, by July 1991 Klaus declared the inter-party cooperation over. The Civic Democratic Party was victorious in the elections of 1992 while the Civic Movement failed to reach the 5% threshold to enter parliament and eventually disappeared.

==Ideologic platforms==
*Interparliamentary Club of the Democratic Right - rightist wing in the party. It was led by Václav Klaus. It transformed into the Civic Democratic Party.
*Liberal Club of the Civic Forum - centrist wing of the party. Opposition to Klaus. It transformed into Civic Movement
*Social Democratic Club of Civic Forum - Social democratic wing led by Rudolf Battěk. It became Association of Social Democrats.

<doc id="699908" wikidata="Q1053916" url="?curid=699908" title="Theme (narrative)">
<text>In contemporary literary studies, a theme is a central , subject, or message within a narrative. Themes can be divided into two categories: a work&#x27;s &quot;thematic concept&quot; is what readers &quot;think the work is about&quot; and its &quot;thematic statement&quot; being &quot;what the work says about the subject&quot;. Themes are often distinguished from premises.

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (for example, love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia; and the dangers of unchecked ambition. A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the —the text&#x27;s or author&#x27;s implied worldview.

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one&#x27;s humanity, which is a theme in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Along with plot, character, setting, and style, theme is considered one of the components of fiction.

==Techniques==
Various techniques may be used to express literary themes.

===Leitwortstil===
&quot;Leitwortstil,&quot; which means &quot;leading word style&quot; in German, is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader&#x27;s attention. An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, &quot;So it goes&quot;, in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. Its seeming message is that the world is deterministic: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that &quot;things could have been different&quot;. Its use in Scheherazade&#x27;s &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; demonstrates how the technique can result to the unification of the constituent members of story cycles. In the Bible, various forms of the verb &quot;to see&quot; also recur and underscore the idea of Abraham as a seer. There is also the repeated use of the root &quot;kbd&quot; in Samuel I, to indicate &quot;weightiness, honor, glory&quot;.

In New Testament studies, a leitwortstil is called a verbal thread. David Rhoads, Joanna Dewey, and Donald Michie identify several verbal threads in their seminal narrative-critical study of the Gospel of Mark. For example, Mark ties together two disparate narratives with a verbal thread that forces the reader to search for connections between the narratives. The word for ripping or tearing (Greek: σχίζω, &quot;schizō&quot;) is found at the baptism of Jesus in Mark 1:10 and at the rending of the temple veil in Mark 15:38.

===Thematic patterning===
&quot;Thematic patterning&quot; means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative. For example, various scenes in John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are about loneliness. Thematic patterning is evident in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, an example being the story of &quot;The City of Brass&quot;. According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that &quot;riches and pomp tempt one away from God&quot;. The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur&#x27;s corpse. According to Pinault, &quot;each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative&quot;.

==Examples==
Some common themes in literature are &quot;love,&quot; &quot;war,&quot; &quot;revenge,&quot; &quot;betrayal,&quot; &quot;patriotism,&quot; &quot;grace,&quot; &quot;isolation,&quot; &quot;motherhood,&quot; &quot;forgiveness,&quot; &quot;wartime loss,&quot; &quot;treachery,&quot; &quot;rich versus poor,&quot; &quot;appearance versus reality,&quot; and &quot;help from other-worldly powers.&quot;

<doc id="699916" wikidata="Q7573485" url="?curid=699916" title="Spanish web">
<text>The Spanish web is an aerial circus skill in which a performer climbs and performs various tricks on an apparatus resembling a vertically hanging rope. It is similar in appearance and performance style to the corde lisse, but with the addition of loops on the rope for hands or feet, permitting one to perform a variety of spinning motions. The name refers to both the apparatus and the performance.

==Rope structure==
The apparatus is akin to a larger kernmantle rope. Unbraided cotton or polyster-blend rope is pulled through a soft, round, cotton sleeve two inches in diameter (a &quot;web&quot;). An eye is made in one end of the web, to which a swivel is attached. That is suspended at one end from the overhead rigging. Towards the top of the web, a hand, foot or neck loop is attached to the main rope through which a performer will secure an ankle, wrist or their neck and be able to hang freely while spinning.

==Performance==
In a typical Spanish web performance, there is a climber (or flyer) and a web setter. The web setter typically kneels on one knee, and the climber can climb first on the setter&#x27;s thigh before ascending the web. Once the climber has ascended the web, the web setter can spin the web around the performer, creating enough centrifugal force to push the performer into a near-horizontal position. Web setting is a specialty skill in its own right, with a lot more difficulty than one might expect. While spinning, the climber can hold on to the web in addition to hanging from the loop or can release the rope and spin that way. With the addition of an extra swivel attached between the loop and the web, it is possible for the performer to also spin separately from the rope.

Spanish web skills are often combined with the skills of corde lisse, which does not utilize a loop or a web setter, but is a stationary rope which the performer winds into different knots around the body, performing various drops and locking positions.

One of the rigging challenges with Spanish web is arresting the torquing forces involved. These forces must be arrested within the rigging systems and that usually involves extra guy lines, gusset plates, diagonal bracing and other such techniques.

<doc id="699924" wikidata="Q1471053" url="?curid=699924" title="Man-Bat">
<text>Man-Bat (Dr. Robert Kirkland &quot;Kirk&quot; Langstrom) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #400 (June 1970) as an enemy of the superhero Batman, the character belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. Originally portrayed as a supervillain, later incarnations show the Man-Bat as a sympathetic villain or antihero.

In the original version of the story, Kirk Langstrom was a zoologist who tried to give humans a bat&#x27;s acute sonar sense. He managed to develop an extract that could supposedly do this, but upon testing it on himself, he transformed into an anthropomorphic feral half-bat hybrid, lacking sapience and acting purely on instinct. Batman managed to reverse the effects, but Langstrom would return as the Man-Bat time and time again, albeit not necessarily as a villain, as Langstrom would sometimes retain enough sanity to use his powers for good. Several other characters have since appeared as similar Man-Bat creatures, including Langstrom&#x27;s wife Francine and father Abraham.

Since his debut at the end of the Silver Age of Comic Books, the Man-Bat has been featured in various media adaptations, including television series and video games. In 2017, the Man-Bat was ranked as &quot;IGN&quot;″s 16th-best Batman villain.

==Publication history==
The character made his first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #400 (June 1970) and was created by Frank Robbins and Neal Adams in collaboration with editor Julius Schwartz. The Man-Bat was the star of his own eponymous series in 1975–1976, which proved to be unpopular and was cancelled after only two issues.

==Fictional character biography==

Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a zoologist who specializes in chiropterology, develops an extract intended to give humans a bat&#x27;s acute sonar sense and tests the formula on himself. The extract works, but it has a horrible side effect: it transforms him into a monstrous human/bat hybrid creature. This side effect makes him so distraught that it temporarily affects his sanity. He goes on a mad rampage until Batman finds a way to reverse the effects. Later, Langstrom takes the concoction again and the Man-Bat returns. He also coaxes his wife, Francine Langstrom, into drinking the serum and she goes through the same transformation, becoming the She-Bat. Together, they terrorize Gotham City until Batman once again restores them to normal.

On some occasions, Langstrom takes the serum and retains enough sanity to work for the forces of good. During one of these periods, he works with the detective Jason Bard. On another occasion, in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #600, Jimmy Olsen inadvertently puts Superman into a cave occupied by the Man-Bat to protect him from kryptonite radiation. The Man-Bat calms the maddened Superman and then summons Hawkman, who helps Superman overcome the radiation. Kirk and Francine have a daughter, Rebecca (&quot;Becky&quot;), and a son, Aaron. Because of the effects the serum has on Aaron&#x27;s DNA, he is born with a deadly illness. Francine turns him into a young Man-Bat to save his life. This occurs in issue #3 of the &quot;Man-Bat&quot; (vol. 2) miniseries by Chuck Dixon.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and beyond===

The Man-Bat is sighted in Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains during the events of the 2005–2006 storyline &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

In the aftermath of that storyline, both Kirk and Francine are shown to be alive in the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline. Talia al Ghul binds and gags Francine, and then threatens to poison her if Kirk does not give her the Man-Bat formula. After Langstrom gives her the formula, she releases Francine as promised. Talia utilizes the Man-Bat to turn some generic members of the League of Assassins into Man-Bat Commandos.

In &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, the Man-Bat is apprehended by the Suicide Squad. He is one of the villains seen in &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. Francine appears in &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, serving as the team&#x27;s technical advisor, and her assistant Salah Miandad operates the &quot;blank&quot; OMAC drone known as ReMAC. In issue #10 of that series, Kirk appears, seemingly healthy and also aiding Francine.

In the 2008 miniseries &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, the Man-Bat is turned into a Justifier and is shown attacking Switzerland&#x27;s Checkmate Headquarters. During the 2009 &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; storyline, following Batman&#x27;s apparent death, Kirk is haunted by nightmares of becoming the Man-Bat and killing his wife. When Francine disappears, he takes the serum and tries to follow her. After an altercation with the Outsiders, he returns to his human form and is captured by Doctor Phosphorus, who reveals that the serum is not necessary to trigger the change. Kirk discovers that Phosphorus has also captured Francine and becomes the Man-Bat to save her.

During the 2009–2010 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Francine tracks down Kirk (as the Man-Bat), having created a cure, and revealed that Kirk&#x27;s next transformation would be permanent if he did not drink it. Kirk attempts to take the cure, but his Man-Bat persona will not let him. Just as Kirk is about to drink it, Francine is wounded in the crossfire of the battle between Black Lantern Solomon Grundy and Bizarro (the latter of whom is already at the scene, trying to prevent Kirk from taking the cure). Distraught at Francine&#x27;s injuries, Kirk transforms into the Man-Bat, seemingly permanently. In &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 3) #10-11, the Man-Bat is seen under the control of the Calculator as a techno-zombie. In the &quot;Collision&quot; storyline of &quot;Red Robin&quot;, following Red Robin&#x27;s actions against Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and the League of Assassins, the latter attempts to murder people related to the Bat-Family. The Man-Bat, following Red Robin&#x27;s orders, protects Julie Madison, a former lover of Bruce Wayne, against Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s assassins.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the majority of Kirk Langstrom&#x27;s history is rebooted. The Man-Bat serum first appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #18 (May 2013). Ignatius Ogilvy also comes into possession of the Man-Bat serum, which he uses as an airborne virus to spread throughout Gotham City&#x27;s &quot;900 Block&quot;.

In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #19 (June 2013), Kirk Langstrom first appears where he and his wife Francine are escorted by Batwoman to Batman&#x27;s location. Langstrom reveals that he is the creator of the serum, intending to help deaf people. Taking responsibility as the creator of the serum, he uses a sample of the serum Batman had obtained to inject himself. This creates an anti-virus which also spreads through the air. Langstrom is turned into a Man-Bat (the last remaining Man-Bat) as his anti-virus cures the remaining citizens of Gotham. It was later revealed that Emperor Penguin was the one who released the virus. Emperor Penguin later made use of Langstrom&#x27;s Man-Bat serum when he combined it with the Venom drug and one of Poison Ivy&#x27;s plant concoctions to empower himself.

Langstrom re-appears in &quot;Batman Inc.&quot; (vol. 2) #10 (June 2013) apparently giving Batman the serum. He claims to be working on an aerosol antidote to the serum as well. The back-up feature of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013), focuses on Langstrom and his wife. He changes from the Man-Bat form into his human form and becomes addicted to the Man-Bat serum, taking it every night. He apparently does not remember his actions from the previous night, yet worries that a string of reported killings are his fault.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, the Man-Bat is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America to join the Secret Society of Super-Villains. The Scarecrow and the Man-Bat attempt to steal the frozen Talons (assassins that are associated with the Court of Owls) from Blackgate while the Penguin is having a meeting with Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as the Man-Bat and his fellow Man-Bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving. The final issues of the series &quot;&quot; would establish that Kirk is the son of a corrupt wealthy pharmaceutical businessman named Abraham Langstrom, who considers his son as a failure when compared to Bruce Wayne, the son of his business rival Thomas Wayne. Abraham would steal his son&#x27;s serum, make some of his own improvements and use it to target the homeless (because no one would miss them) before being stopped by Batman, though he is able to plead temporary insanity to avoid going to prison.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, the Man-Bat is featured on the news as an example of the &quot;Superman Theory&quot;, stating that some metahumans were given their powers by the government. He later accompanies Black Adam in his attack on the White House.

In &quot;Harley Quinn Rebirth&quot;, Langstrom&#x27;s wife goes on a rampage against Harley and her friends, turning Harley and her friend Tony into Man-Bats as part of the Penguin&#x27;s plan to break Harley&#x27;s spirit. Their other friends get Langstrom released and he helps them find the antidote before predictably escaping himself.

The Man-Bat later becomes a founding member of the second incarnation of Justice League Dark.

==Powers and abilities==
By taking his bat gland extract, Kirk Langstrom transforms himself into a bat-like creature. When taking an antidote or if the serum wears off, he reverts to human form. As the Man-Bat, his strength, resiliency, speed, and agility are all augmented to inhuman levels. He possesses an extra set of digits in his leathery wings that allows Kirk to fly. With his sonar radar, Kirk can emit high-pitch sound waves and hear those echoes when they bounce off of nearby objects, thus enabling him to navigate perfectly in the darkness. If in the Man-Bat form for long periods of time, he loses control over his bestial side that works purely on instinct, plus making him prone to harm friend or foe alike.

As Kirk Langstrom, he is a highly intelligent scientist in the fields of biochemistry and zoology (particularly chiropterology).

==Other characters named the Man-Bat==
===Francine Langstrom===
===Man-Bat Commandos===
As mentioned above, Talia al Ghul captured Kirk Langstrom and threatened to poison Francine if he did not give her the Man-Bat formula. Kirk gives in to Talia al Ghul&#x27;s demands, and she uses the Man-Bat formula on members of the League of Assassins to turn them into Man-Bats.

During the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; story line, Talia al Ghul sends the Man-Bat Commandos to destroy Jezebel Jet&#x27;s airplane.

In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC Universe. Various Man-Bats have appeared under the control of Talia al Ghul in her plot to destroy Batman. It is later explained that Talia al Ghul had an agent steal the serum from Langstrom&#x27;s laboratory to use on her soldiers to create the Man-Bat Commandos.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, some Man-Bat Commandos were used to help the Crime Syndicate hunt down the Rogues. The Mirror Master managed to trap some of them in the Mirror World. When a Man-Bat snatches up the Weather Wizard, the other Rogues members chase after it until it crashes into an ice wall upon arriving in Mr. Freeze&#x27;s territory.

===Abraham Langstrom===
Back when Thomas and Martha Wayne were still alive, Kirk Langstrom had a father named Abraham whose company, Patriarch Biopharmaceuticals, competed with Wayne Enterprises. Years after the death of Thomas and Martha, Abraham continued his shady deals, which involved exploiting his son&#x27;s Man-Bat serum which he planned to profit from. He soon became addicted to the upgraded serum. When he became a Man-Bat, Abraham targeted the homeless people of Gotham City, draining them of their blood. This caused Batman to team up with Kirk Langstrom to fight Abraham. Because the skin of Abraham&#x27;s Man-Bat form was tough, Batman injected himself with the cure and tricked Abraham into drinking his blood enough to transform back to normal. Batman then handed Abraham over to the police. After evading incarceration by claiming that he had no knowledge on what his Man-Bat form did, Abraham returned to his company, though he was wary of the fact that Batman may catch him if he ever makes a mistake.

<text>The Niagara Falls International Rainbow Bridge, commonly known as the Rainbow Bridge, is a steel arch bridge across the Niagara River, connecting the cities of Niagara Falls, New York, United States, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.

==Construction==
The Rainbow Bridge was built near the site of the earlier Honeymoon Bridge, which collapsed in 1938 due to an ice jam in the Niagara Gorge.

Architect Richard (Su Min) Lee designed the bridge; a design also used for the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, approximately downriver. The bridge&#x27;s Rainbow Tower and Canadian side plaza are the work of another Canadian architect, William Lyon Somerville. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, during their visit to Niagara Falls as part of their 1939 royal tour of Canada, dedicated the future construction site of the Rainbow Bridge; a monument was later erected to commemorate the occasion. Construction began in May 1940. The bridge officially opened on November 1, 1941.

The Niagara Falls Bridge Commission chose the name &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; in March 1939, because rainbows occur frequently near the falls due to water spray and mist in the air.

== Description and specifications ==
The New York State Department of Transportation designates the bridge as , an unsigned reference route. Roads that adjoin the bridge include New York routes 104 and 384, and the Niagara Scenic Parkway. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation designates the bridge as part of Highway 420. The Rainbow Tower, part of the plaza complex on the Canadian side, houses a carillon, which plays several times daily.

The Rainbow Bridge does not permit commercial trucks; the nearest border crossing accessible to trucks is the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge.

For each pedestrian or bicyclist, the toll to cross the bridge is $1.00 USD or CAD. For vehicles, the toll is only collected when leaving the United States and entering Canada. , the cash toll for personal vehicles is $5.00 USD or $6.50 CAD.

==2023 car crash==
On November 22, 2023, a 2022 Bentley Flying Spur traveling at a high rate of speed left the roadway, went airborne, crashed and exploded at the Rainbow Bridge border crossing on the American side. The vehicle&#x27;s two occupants died, and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was injured. The crash and subsequent explosion was at first investigated as a potential terrorist attack, but was later determined to have been an unintentional crash.

<text>The is a suspension bridge crossing northern Tokyo Bay between Shibaura Pier and the Odaiba waterfront development in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

It is named &quot;Tōkyō Kō Renrakukyō&quot; (東京港連絡橋) as the official name in Japanese.

It was built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, with construction starting in 1987 and completed in 1993. The bridge is long with a main span of . Officially called the &quot;Shuto Expressway No. 11 Daiba Route - Port of Tokyo Connector Bridge&quot;, the name &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; was decided by the public.

The towers supporting the bridge are white in color, designed to harmonize with the skyline of central Tokyo seen from Odaiba. There are lamps placed on the wires supporting the bridge, which are illuminated into three different colors, red, white and green every night using solar energy obtained during the day.

The bridge can be accessed by foot from Tamachi Station (JR East) or Shibaura-futō Station (Yurikamome) on the mainland side.

==Usage==
The Rainbow Bridge carries three transportation lines on two decks. The upper deck carries the Shuto Expressway&#x27;s Daiba Route, while the lower deck carries the Yurikamome rapid transit system in the centre, walkways on the outer side, and Tokyo Prefectural Route 482 in-between. Light motorcycles under 50cc are not permitted on either deck or the walkway of the bridge. Motorcycle pillion passengers are also banned.

===Walkway===
The bridge has two separate walkways on the north and south sides of the lower deck; the north side offers views of the inner Tokyo harbour and Tokyo Tower, while the south side offers views of Tokyo Bay and occasionally Mount Fuji. The walkways may only be used during certain hours (9 am to 9 pm in the summer; 10 am to 6 pm in the winter, access to the walkways close 30 minutes before closing time.) Bicycles are permitted on the condition that they are pushed (as opposed to riding them).

<doc id="699944" wikidata="Q551665" url="?curid=699944" title="Miloš Jakeš">
<text>Miloš Jakeš (12 August 1922 – 10 July 2020) was a Czech communist politician. He was General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1987 until 1989. 

He resigned from his position in late November 1989, amid the Velvet Revolution.

==Early life==
Jakeš was born in České Chalupy, now part of Nová Ves near České Budějovice. He grew up in a poor village family in the Bohemian Forest borderlands before working in Bata Shoes factory in Zlín between 1937 and 1950. He joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia soon after World War II, triggering his steady rise within the party ranks. In 1955 he began his studies at Moscow&#x27;s Party&#x27;s Higher College and, after obtaining his degree in 1958, his career continued without interruption, undisturbed even during the 1968 Prague Spring period. After the Soviet invasion, Jakeš became one of the main initiators of the political purges carried out in the name of &quot;normalization&quot;.

==Party leader==
Following the ouster of Gustáv Husák at a dramatic party meeting in December 1987, Jakeš was nominated for the position of General Secretary by the competing factions within the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Following his rise to power, Jakeš began to promote himself as a supporter of glasnost and perestroika. Yet, despite the Communist Party&#x27;s attempt to appease the public&#x27;s demands for reform, Jakeš remained staunchly opposed to any dialogue with the growing opposition movement in the country. Even when the Velvet Revolution broke out, Jakeš refused to consider any serious talks with the opposition. Events soon overtook him, and on 24 November he resigned along with the party&#x27;s entire Presidium. The Communists officially abandoned power four days later.

As General Secretary Jakeš used the first name Miloš. During the trial it was revealed that his actual name is Milouš.

==Speech in Červený Hradek==
Jakeš gained unwanted infamy through his famous speech addressed to local party workers in Červený Hrádek close to Plzeň. When speaking about the necessity of Gorbachev-inspired &quot;perestroika&quot;, he presented himself and the party as a &quot;lonely pole plank&quot; being allegedly left alone to overcome the hardships. Jakeš also mistook the word &quot;broiler&quot; (type of chicken) for &quot;boiler&quot; and spoke in an embarrassingly familiar way about some Czech pop music singers when pointing to their allegedly super-high incomes (&quot;None of us earns so much!&quot;). His speech had been recorded by a journalist from Czech Television who managed to secretly make a copy of the tape. The recording was frequently copied among the people in summer 1989 and afterwards.

==Personal life and death==
Jakeš lived in Prague as an ordinary pensioner and was a frequent guest at Communist rallies after the revolution. He wrote a book entitled &quot;Dva roky generálním tajemníkem&quot; (&quot;Two years as the General Secretary&quot;), in which he compared the forty-year-long Communist rule of Czechoslovakia to the Hussite period in the nation&#x27;s history. Jakeš died between 9 July 2020 and the following day at the age of 97.

<text>Alan White (14 June 1949 – 26 May 2022) was an English drummer, best known for his almost 50-year tenure in the progressive rock band Yes. He joined Yes in 1972 as a replacement for original drummer Bill Bruford. He was the longest-serving member of the band and, alongside founder/bassist Chris Squire, the only member never to leave prior to his death. 

In 1969, White joined John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band, after Lennon invited him to play at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival, followed by a show at the Lyceum Ballroom. He played drums on the singles &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;, as well as most of Lennon&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Imagine&quot; album.

In addition to his work with Yes and John Lennon, White performed on over 50 albums by other musicians, including George Harrison, Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, Terry Reid, Joe Cocker and The Ventures.

White was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes in 2017.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
White was born in the village of Pelton, County Durham, England. His father had different jobs, working as a clerk, shopkeeper, and a lorry and bus driver who also played the piano in local pubs. His grandfather played the piano and his uncle was a drummer in local dance bands. He attended a technical school and, at age seven, moved to the nearby town of Ferryhill, where he spent the rest of his childhood. At age six, White began to take piano lessons, playing the instrument &quot;very percussively&quot;, which his uncle noticed and informed his parents who bought him an Ajax drum kit for Christmas when he was twelve. White named his uncle as a big influence. White felt he was pushed to learn and play like his drum instructor and wished &quot;to be more individual&quot; on the instrument, so he began to develop his own style. His parents went on to buy him a metallic silver Ludwig kit.

=== Early bands and session work ===
Several months into formal drumming lessons, White joined his first band, a local group named the Downbeats, at thirteen. They performed songs by the Beatles, the Searchers, and Gerry and the Pacemakers. The group became well known in the Newcastle area, playing working men&#x27;s clubs and dance halls as much as seven nights a week until late. White&#x27;s school teachers only found out about his activities when the band were featured in the local newspaper. In 1964, the Downbeats changed their name to the Blue Chips and travelled to London to enter an amateur band contest held at the London Palladium by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. They won the contest and were awarded money, new equipment, and a recording contract and recorded several singles which did not chart. They returned home, and disbanded soon after.

White reduced his music commitments in order to pass his school exams, after which he became interested in studying technical drawing at college with the plan to become an architect. At seventeen, he pursued music and toured the cabaret circuit as part of Billy Fury&#x27;s band the Gamblers, which included several gigs in Germany. White went on to play in Happy Magazine, later known as Griffin, with Alan Marshall and Kenny Craddock, and put out several records with Alan Price as their producer. White continued to tour and play with Price in his group, the Alan Price Set, and took up several jobs as a session musician.

In 1969, White received a call from John Lennon who invited him to join his Plastic Ono Band for their live performance at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. Lennon had attended a Griffin performance in a club and wanted White to join the band of Yoko Ono, Eric Clapton, and Klaus Voormann. White disbelieved Lennon&#x27;s call and offer and thought he was a prankster, but accepted the invitation for the show which took place on 13 September 1969, at Varsity Stadium in front of 20,000 people. The set was later released as a live album, &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;. The gig landed White further session jobs, including drum work on &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; for Lennon and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; by George Harrison, as well as the opening track, the epic &quot;Govinda&quot;, for &quot;The Radha Krsna Temple&quot; (produced by Harrison). Around the same time, White worked with Denny Laine in his band Balls for several months, which was followed by a ten-week stint with the fifteen-piece band, Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, and a period with Steve Winwood and Terry Reid.

=== Yes ===

To save time commuting to London from the house he shared with his Griffin bandmates in Sussex, White shared a flat with engineer and producer Eddy Offord who worked with Yes on their albums and tours. In early 1972, White attended their session at Advision Studios to record a promotional film for their arrangement of &quot;America&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Soon after, he turned up to one of their rehearsals of &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, a song for their fifth album, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. Their drummer Bill Bruford had to leave the session early, leaving White to sit in with the band for the rest of it. White then joined Chris Stainton&#x27;s All Stars for a European tour in support of Joe Cocker, which included a show at the Rainbow Theatre in London that Yes bassist Chris Squire attended.

On 19 July 1972, after Yes had finished recording &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, Bruford left to join King Crimson. With their supporting tour less than a week away, the band were desperate for a replacement. White then got a call from Tony Dimitriades, who handled Offord&#x27;s affairs and later became Yes&#x27;s manager, informing White that the band wanted him to join. Anderson and Squire then met White at Offord&#x27;s flat, and he joined. He spent the following three days learning the band&#x27;s repertoire before the Close to the Edge Tour began in Dallas, Texas on 30 July 1972. In the same week, White was offered a place in both Jethro Tull and America. White&#x27;s performance was documented on their first live album &quot;Yessongs&quot;, in 1973; this was followed by his first studio album with them later that year, &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;.

White played drums and percussion on over 40 studio and live Yes albums, additionally adding piano parts and collaborating on the songwriting, notably &quot;The Remembering (High the Memory)&quot; and &quot;Ritual (Nous Sommes du Soleil)&quot; from &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;; all the &quot;Relayer&quot; album; &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; from &quot;Going for the One&quot;; &quot;Future Times&quot; and &quot;Release, Release&quot; from &quot;Tormato&quot;; all of the &quot;Drama&quot; album; &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Our Song&quot;, and &quot;Hearts&quot; from &quot;90125&quot;; &quot;Big Generator&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Running&quot; from &quot;Big Generator&quot;; all of &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;; all of &quot;The Ladder&quot; album; all of the &quot;Magnification&quot; album; &quot;The Gift of Love&quot; from &quot;From a Page&quot;; and &quot;To Ascend&quot; from &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;.

White played over 3,070 live shows during his tenure with Yes. Due to various health problems, White missed a 28-date tour with Yes in 2016, with Jay Schellen substituting for him, after which White returned to the live touring band, accompanied by Schellen in 2017, Dylan Howe (son of guitarist Steve Howe) in mid 2017, and Schellen again from early 2018, contributing to some double drumming not seen onstage since Yes&#x27;s Union tours in 1991–2.

In 2018 White toured with Yes celebrating their 50th anniversary, with founding member Tony Kaye a guest on all US and Japan shows.

In 2019, during &quot;The Royal Affair&quot; tour, Yes acknowledged White&#x27;s career pre-Yes by performing &quot;Imagine&quot; as the first encore, with the Moody Blues&#x27; John Lodge sharing lead vocals towards the end of the tour. The video wall backdrop to &quot;Imagine&quot; featured unseen footage of the &quot;Imagine&quot; album sessions featuring Lennon, Ono, Harrison, Voormann, White and other contributors to the album and sessions.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw the postponement of US dates around &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot;, plus a 35-date European tour which was postponed to 2021 and then to 2022 and then 2023 and later to 2024; White died before he could participate in the rescheduled performances. His last work with Yes to be heard was the studio album &quot;The Quest&quot; (2021).

=== Other projects ===
White released his only solo album, &quot;Ramshackled&quot;, in 1976.

White had guested with local Seattle band MerKaBa on a number of occasions and White and MerKaBa also had links with another local band, Treason. In 2003, White joined sessions for a new MerKaBa album, but these evolved into a new band, called White, and an album&#x27;s worth of demo recordings under the name &quot;Loyal&quot;. As well as White, the band consisted of Kevin Currie (from MerKaBa; lead vocals), Karl Haug (from Treason; electric and acoustic guitars, lap steel), Steve Boyce (from MerKaBa; bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Ted Stockwell (from Treason and MerKaBa; keys, guitar). Stockwell left the band and, in April 2005, was replaced by White&#x27;s former colleague in Yes, keyboardist Geoff Downes. A new album, &quot;White&quot;, was recorded, partly based on the &quot;Loyal&quot; demos. The album was released in 2006, with a cover by Roger Dean.

The band played live (with various keyboardists) in the Seattle area. They were due to join the abortive More Drama Tour, scheduled to begin in North America in August 2005, with three acts: White, The Syn, and Steve Howe, with Yes members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Geoff Downes playing Yes material at the end of the evening (with Currie handling lead vocals). The tour was cancelled shortly before it was due to begin. White later joined The Syn touring band for dates in the first half of 2006. Subsequently, White worked with Yes alumni Kaye and Billy Sherwood in the initial line-up of Circa.

In 2010, the band White re-emerged after a hiatus with a new line-up of White, Haug and Boyce joined by two musicians from Yes tribute band Parallels, who had previously worked with White: vocalist Robyn Dawn and keyboardist Jonathan Sindelman.

On 28 October 2017, to celebrate his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, White played in a halftime performance with the University of Washington Husky Marching Band.

== Personal life and death ==
White was married for over 40 years to his wife Gigi; they lived in Newcastle, Washington. They had two children, Jesse (also a musician) and Cassi. In 1997, he served as the best man at Jon Anderson&#x27;s wedding.

White died at his home in Newcastle, Washington, on 26 May 2022, aged 72, following a brief illness. It had been announced four days earlier that he would be absent from the &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; 50th anniversary tour due to health issues.

Two months before his death, many personal items and valuable musical instruments were stolen from White&#x27;s home and from a nearby storage facility. Stolen or damaged items included platinum record awards and a drum kit that White had used on the Plastic Ono Band sessions.

A tribute concert for White was held on 2 October 2022 featuring members of Yes and White along with other special guests including former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin.

<text>&quot;Ave maris stella&quot; (Latin for &#x27;Hail, star of the sea&#x27;) is a medieval Marian hymn, usually sung at Vespers. It was especially popular in the Middle Ages and has been used by many composers, as the basis of other compositions.

==Background== 
Authorship of the original hymn has been attributed to several people, including Bernard of Clairvaux (12th century), Venantius Fortunatus (6th century) and Hermannus Contractus (11th century). Probably originating in the 9th century, it appears as a 10th century addition in two 9th-century manuscripts, one from Salzburg now in Vienna and the other still at the Abbey of Saint Gall. Its frequent occurrence in the Divine Office made it popular in the Middle Ages, many other hymns being founded upon it. The &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; was highly influential in presenting Mary as a merciful and loving Mother. &quot;Much of its charm is due to its simplicity&quot;. The title &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; is one of the oldest and most widespread titles applied to Mary. The hymn is frequently used as a prayer for safe-conduct for travelers.

The melody is found in the Irish plainsong &quot;Gabhaim Molta Bríde&quot;, a piece in praise of St. Brigid of Kildaire. The popular modern hymn &quot;Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star&quot;, is loosely based on this plainsong original.

== Latin lyrics ==

The Latin text of the hymn as authorized for use in the Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Rite (Ordinary Form) is the following:

==Musical settings==

The plainchant hymn has been developed by many composers from pre-baroque to the present day. The Roman Rite employs four different plainchant tunes for the Ave maris stella; the first three are designated for solemnities, feasts, and memorials of the Blessed Virgin Mary; a fourth is given in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary as an alternative to the memorial tone. The tunes have been used as the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; for some polyphonic settings of the mass, including those by Josquin and Victoria.

Renaissance settings include those by Hans Leo Hassler, Felice Anerio, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Guillaume Dufay and William Byrd. Baroque settings include Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610&quot;, one by Emperor Leopold I, one by Louis Couperin in 1658, four settings by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (H.60, H.63, H.65, H.67 1670–1680s), and Sébastien de Brossard. Romantic settings include those by Dvorak, Grieg, and Liszt. Modern composers who have either set the text or used the hymn as an inspiration include Marcel Dupré, Flor Peeters, Abel Decaux, Peter Maxwell Davies, Grace Williams, James MacMillan, Jean Langlais, and others.

==Acadian National Anthem==
In 1884, the second Acadian national convention adopted &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; as the anthem of Acadia.

<doc id="699964" wikidata="Q92824" url="?curid=699964" title="Judea Pearl">
<text>Judea Pearl (born September 4, 1936) is an Israeli-American computer scientist and philosopher, best known for championing the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence and the development of Bayesian networks (see the article on belief propagation). He is also credited for developing a theory of causal and counterfactual inference based on structural models (see article on causality). In 2011, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) awarded Pearl with the Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science, &quot;for fundamental contributions to artificial intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic and causal reasoning&quot;. He is the author of several books, including the technical &quot;Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Why&quot;, a book on causality aimed at the general public.

Judea Pearl is the father of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in Pakistan connected with Al-Qaeda and the International Islamic Front in 2002 for his American and Jewish heritage.

==Biography==
Judea Pearl was born in Tel Aviv, British Mandate for Palestine, in 1936 to Eliezer and Tova Pearl, who were Polish Jewish immigrants, grew up in Bnei Brak. His grandfather Chaim Pearl was one of Bnei Brak&#x27;s founders. He is a descendant of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk on his mother&#x27;s side. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces and joining a kibbutz, Pearl decided to study engineering in 1956. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the Technion 1960. That same year, he emigrated to the United States and pursued graduate studies. He received an M.S. in electrical engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1961, and went on to receive an M.S. in physics from Rutgers University and a PhD in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now the New York University Tandon School of Engineering) in 1965. He worked at RCA Research Laboratories (now SRI International) in Princeton, New Jersey on superconductive parametric amplifiers and storage devices and at Electronic Memories, Inc., on advanced memory systems. When semiconductors &quot;wiped out&quot; Pearl&#x27;s work, as he later expressed it, he joined UCLA&#x27;s School of Engineering in 1970 and started work on probabilistic artificial intelligence. He is one of the founding editors of the &quot;Journal of Causal Inference&quot;.

Pearl is currently a professor of computer science and statistics and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at UCLA. He and his wife, Ruth, had three children. In addition, , he is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.

Former Israeli Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, partnered with Judea Pearl in the documentary &quot;With My Whole Broken Heart&quot;.

==Murder of Daniel Pearl==
In 2002, his son, Daniel Pearl, a journalist working for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan, leading Judea and the other members of the family and friends to create the Daniel Pearl Foundation. On the seventh anniversary of Daniel&#x27;s death, Judea wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; titled &quot;Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil: When will our luminaries stop making excuses for terror?&quot;.

Emeritus Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks quoted Judea Pearl&#x27;s beliefs in a lesson on Judaism: &quot;I asked Judea Pearl, father of the murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, why he was working for reconciliation between Jews and Muslims...he replied with heartbreaking lucidity, &#x27;Hate killed my son. Therefore I am determined to fight hate.&#x27;&quot;

==Views==
On his religious views, Pearl states that he is a &quot;practicing disbeliever.&quot; He is very connected to Jewish traditions such as holidays and kiddush on Friday night.

==Research==
Judea Pearl is credited for &quot;laying the foundations of modern artificial intelligence, so computer systems can process uncertainty and relate causes to effects.&quot;

He is one of the pioneers of Bayesian networks and the probabilistic approach to artificial intelligence, and one of the first to mathematize causal modeling in the empirical sciences. His work is also intended as a high-level cognitive model. He is interested in the philosophy of science, knowledge representation, nonstandard logics, and learning. Pearl is described as &quot;one of the giants in the field of artificial intelligence&quot; by UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf. His work on causality has &quot;revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine and the social sciences&quot; according to the Association for Computing Machinery.

<text>In projective geometry, Pascal&#x27;s theorem (also known as the hexagrammum mysticum theorem, Latin for mystical hexagram) states that if six arbitrary points are chosen on a conic (which may be an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola in an appropriate affine plane) and joined by line segments in any order to form a hexagon, then the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon (extended if necessary) meet at three points which lie on a straight line, called the Pascal line of the hexagon. It is named after Blaise Pascal.

The theorem is also valid in the Euclidean plane, but the statement needs to be adjusted to deal with the special cases when opposite sides are parallel.

This theorem is a generalization of Pappus&#x27;s (hexagon) theorem, which is the special case of a degenerate conic of two lines with three points on each line.

== Euclidean variants ==

The most natural setting for Pascal&#x27;s theorem is in a projective plane since any two lines meet and no exceptions need to be made for parallel lines. However, the theorem remains valid in the Euclidean plane, with the correct interpretation of what happens when some opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel.

If exactly one pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, then the conclusion of the theorem is that the &quot;Pascal line&quot; determined by the two points of intersection is parallel to the parallel sides of the hexagon. If two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, then all three pairs of opposite sides form pairs of parallel lines and there is no Pascal line in the Euclidean plane (in this case, the line at infinity of the extended Euclidean plane is the Pascal line of the hexagon).

== Related results ==

Pascal&#x27;s theorem is the polar reciprocal and projective dual of Brianchon&#x27;s theorem. It was formulated by Blaise Pascal in a note written in 1639 when he was 16 years old and published the following year as a broadside titled &quot;Essay pour les coniques. Par B. P.&quot;

Pascal&#x27;s theorem is a special case of the Cayley–Bacharach theorem.

A degenerate case of Pascal&#x27;s theorem (four points) is interesting; given points on a conic , the intersection of alternate sides, , , together with the intersection of tangents at opposite vertices and are collinear in four points; the tangents being degenerate &#x27;sides&#x27;, taken at two possible positions on the &#x27;hexagon&#x27; and the corresponding Pascal line sharing either degenerate intersection. This can be proven independently using a property of pole-polar. If the conic is a circle, then another degenerate case says that for a triangle, the three points that appear as the intersection of a side line with the corresponding side line of the Gergonne triangle, are collinear.

Six is the minimum number of points on a conic about which special statements can be made, as five points determine a conic.

The converse is the Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem, named for 18th-century British mathematicians William Braikenridge and Colin Maclaurin , which states that if the three intersection points of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic; the conic may be degenerate, as in Pappus&#x27;s theorem. The Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem may be applied in the Braikenridge–Maclaurin construction, which is a synthetic construction of the conic defined by five points, by varying the sixth point.

The theorem was generalized by August Ferdinand Möbius in 1847, as follows: suppose a polygon with sides is inscribed in a conic section, and opposite pairs of sides are extended until they meet in points. Then if of those points lie on a common line, the last point will be on that line, too.

==&quot;Hexagrammum Mysticum&quot;==
If six unordered points are given on a conic section, they can be connected into a hexagon in 60 different ways, resulting in 60 different instances of Pascal&#x27;s theorem and 60 different Pascal lines. This configuration of 60 lines is called the &quot;Hexagrammum Mysticum&quot;.

As Thomas Kirkman proved in 1849, these 60 lines can be associated with 60 points in such a way that each point is on three lines and each line contains three points. The 60 points formed in this way are now known as the Kirkman points. The Pascal lines also pass, three at a time, through 20 Steiner points. There are 20 Cayley lines which consist of a Steiner point and three Kirkman points. The Steiner points also lie, four at a time, on 15 Plücker lines. Furthermore, the 20 Cayley lines pass four at a time through 15 points known as the Salmon points.

==Proofs==

Pascal&#x27;s original note has no proof, but there are various modern proofs of the theorem.

It is sufficient to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic can be reduced to a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that what is true in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate conic).

A short elementary proof of Pascal&#x27;s theorem in the case of a circle was found by , based on the proof in . This proof proves the theorem for circle and then generalizes it to conics.

A short elementary computational proof in the case of the real projective plane was found by .

We can infer the proof from existence of isogonal conjugate too. If we are to show that , , are collinear for concyclic , then notice that and are similar, and that and will correspond to the isogonal conjugate if we overlap the similar triangles. This means that , hence making collinear.

A short proof can be constructed using cross-ratio preservation. Projecting tetrad from onto line , we obtain tetrad , and projecting tetrad from onto line , we obtain tetrad . This therefore means that , where one of the points in the two tetrads overlap, hence meaning that other lines connecting the other three pairs must coincide to preserve cross ratio. Therefore, are collinear.

Another proof for Pascal&#x27;s theorem for a circle uses Menelaus&#x27; theorem repeatedly.

Dandelin, the geometer who discovered the celebrated Dandelin spheres, came up with a beautiful proof using &quot;3D lifting&quot; technique that is analogous to the 3D proof of Desargues&#x27; theorem. The proof makes use of the property that for every conic section we can find a one-sheet hyperboloid which passes through the conic.

There also exists a simple proof for Pascal&#x27;s theorem for a circle using the law of sines and similarity.

==Proof using cubic curves==
Pascal&#x27;s theorem has a short proof using the Cayley–Bacharach theorem that given any 8 points in general position, there is a unique ninth point such that all cubics through the first 8 also pass through the ninth point. In particular, if 2 general cubics intersect in 8 points then any other cubic through the same 8 points meets the ninth point of intersection of the first two cubics. Pascal&#x27;s theorem follows by taking the 8 points as the 6 points on the hexagon and two of the points (say, and in the figure) on the would-be Pascal line, and the ninth point as the third point ( in the figure). The first two cubics are two sets of 3 lines through the 6 points on the hexagon (for instance, the set , and the set ), and the third cubic is the union of the conic and the line . Here the &quot;ninth intersection&quot; cannot lie on the conic by genericity, and hence it lies on .

The Cayley–Bacharach theorem is also used to prove that the group operation on cubic elliptic curves is associative. The same group operation can be applied on a conic if we choose a point on the conic and a line in the plane. The sum of and is obtained by first finding the intersection point of line with , which is . Next and add up to the second intersection point of the conic with line , which is . Thus if is the second intersection point of the conic with line , then

:formula_1

Thus the group operation is associative. On the other hand, Pascal&#x27;s theorem follows from the above associativity formula, and thus from the associativity of the group operation of elliptic curves by way of continuity.

==Proof using Bézout&#x27;s theorem==

Suppose is the cubic polynomial vanishing on the three lines through and is the cubic vanishing on the other three lines . Pick a generic point on the conic and choose so that the cubic vanishes on . Then is a cubic that has 7 points in common with the conic. But by Bézout&#x27;s theorem a cubic and a conic have at most 3 × 2 = 6 points in common, unless they have a common component. So the cubic has a component in common with the conic which must be the conic itself, so is the union of the conic and a line. It is now easy to check that this line is the Pascal line.

== A property of Pascal&#x27;s hexagon ==

Again given the hexagon on a conic of Pascal&#x27;s theorem with the above notation for points (in the first figure), we have
:formula_2

== Degenerations of Pascal&#x27;s theorem ==

There exist 5-point, 4-point and 3-point degenerate cases of Pascal&#x27;s theorem. In a degenerate case, two previously connected points of the figure will formally coincide and the connecting line becomes the tangent at the coalesced point. See the degenerate cases given in the added scheme and the external link on &quot;circle geometries&quot;. If one chooses suitable lines of the Pascal-figures as lines at infinity one gets many interesting figures on parabolas and hyperbolas.

<text>Maximilian Hell () (born Rudolf Maximilian Höll; May 15, 1720 – April 14, 1792) was an astronomer and an ordained Jesuit priest from the Kingdom of Hungary. The lunar crater Hell is named after him.

== Biography ==

Born as Rudolf Maximilian Höll in Selmecbánya, Hont County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia), but later changed his surname to Hell. He was the third son from the second marriage of his father Matthias Cornelius Hell (Matthäus Kornelius Hell) and his mother Julianna Staindl. The couple had a total of 22 children. Registry entries indicate that the family was of German descent, while Maximilian Hell later in life (ca. 1750) is known to declare himself as Hungarian. but his mother tongue was German. Even so, Hell considered himself a Hungarian.

The place of birth of Maximilian&#x27;s father is unknown; the settlements Körmöcbánya (today Kremnica), Schlagenwald, (today Horní Slavkov) or Schlackenwerth (today Ostrov nad Ohří) are most frequently given. Born in a mixed German, Hungarian and Slovak town, he presumably knew Slovak to a certain extent and he probably understood Hungarian, but his mother tongue was German. Even so, Hell considered himself a Hungarian. Hell with another Jesuit priest, János Sajnovics tried to explore the already widely discussed but insufficiently documented affinity between the language of the Sami, Finns and the Hungarians during and after their residency in Vardø. (&quot;Demonstratio idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse&quot;, 1770 Copenhagen)

Hell became the director of the Vienna Observatory in 1756. He published the astronomical tables &quot;Ephemerides astronomicae ad meridianum Vindobonemsem&quot; (&quot;Ephemerides for the Meridian of Vienna&quot;). He and his assistant János Sajnovics went to Vardø in the far north of Norway (then part of Denmark-Norway) to observe the 1769 transit of Venus. He was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters on October 13, 1769. This society also funded the publication of his 1770 account of the Venus passage &quot;Observatio transitus Veneris ante discum Solis die 3. Junii anno 1769&quot; (Copenhagen, 1770).

There was some controversy about Hell&#x27;s observations of the transit of Venus because he stayed in Norway for eight months, collecting non-astronomical scientific data about the arctic regions for a planned encyclopedia (which never appeared, in part due to the suppression of the Jesuit order). The publication of his results was delayed, and some (notably Joseph Johann Littrow) accused Hell posthumously of falsifying his results. However, Simon Newcomb carefully studied Hell&#x27;s notebooks and exonerated him a century after his death in Vienna.

Besides astronomy, Hell also had an interest in magnet therapy (the alleged healing power of magnets), although it was Franz Anton Mesmer who went further with this and received most of the credit.

In 1771, Hell was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The crater Hell on the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="699978" wikidata="Q526836" url="?curid=699978" title="Mudchute DLR station">
<text>Mudchute is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station on the Isle of Dogs, next to Mudchute in London, England. The station is situated in the Millwall area and is in Travelcard Zone 2. The name of the area refers to the engineering overspill when Millwall Dock was being created in the 1840s. Spoil from the excavation of the Dock and silt from its channels and waterways were dumped on nearby land, creating &quot;The Mudchute&quot;, which quickly established itself as a wildlife habitat and adventuring location for local children.

==History==
The station was originally intended to be named Millwall Park but around the time the DLR was being constructed Millwall F.C. had experienced some particularly nasty incidents of hooliganism, and a minority of its fans were considered to be amongst the most riotous in the country. Apart from any negative association the name may have given, local people were concerned that visiting fans in particular would travel to the station in error – not realising that the club&#x27;s ground is some distance away on the other side of the river. Consequently, the name Mudchute was suggested and subsequently agreed upon.
The original station was on the route of the Millwall Extension Railway which was an old Victorian railway line that had been disused for many years. The original elevated station opened on 31 August 1987 and it was the last station before the terminus at Island Gardens. When the line was extended under the River Thames to Lewisham the station was rebuilt in a shallow cutting close to the tunnel entrance. The rebuilt station opened on 20 November 1999. In April 2008 work started on replacing the siding formed by the old route into a third platform for reversing trains and adding a canopy over the station. By October 2009 these works were complete.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Mudchute is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 135, 277 and night route N277 serve the station.

<text>Joseph Johann von Littrow (13 March 1781, Horšovský Týn () – 30 November 1840, Vienna) was an Austrian astronomer. In 1837, he was ennobled with the title Joseph Johann Edler von Littrow. He was the father of Karl Ludwig Edler von Littrow and the mentor of the mathematician Nikolai Brashman. His work took him to Russia for a time, which is where his son who succeeded him was born.

He became director of the Vienna Observatory in 1819. He served in this position until his death in 1840. He created the only conformal retroazimuthal map projection, which is known as the Littrow projection. Littrow authored the widely read &quot;Wunder des Himmels&quot; (&quot;Miracles of the Sky&quot;), which was reprinted eight times by 1897.

Von Littrow is often associated with a proposal to dig a large circular canal in the Sahara desert and fill it with burning kerosene, thus communicating the fact of human intelligence to aliens who may be observing Earth. However, Von Littrow&#x27;s connection with this scheme may be apocryphal.

The crater Littrow on the Moon is named in his honor.

He is the great-great-great-grandfather of Roman Catholic Cardinal Christoph Schönborn.

== Timeline ==
* 1799 Entered Charles University
* 1802 Graduated in jurisprudence and theology

<doc id="700007" wikidata="Q2014237" url="?curid=700007" title="Ode to Newfoundland">
<text>&quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot; is the official provincial anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 

Originally composed by Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle in 1902 as a four-verse poem titled &quot;Newfoundland&quot;; it was sung by Frances Daisy Foster at the Casino Theatre of St. John&#x27;s during the closing of the play &quot;Mamzelle&quot; on December 22, 1902. The original score was set to the music of E. R. Krippner, a German bandmaster living in St. John&#x27;s but Boyle desired a more dignified score. It was then set to the music of British composer Sir Hubert Parry, a personal friend of Boyle, who composed two settings. 

On May 20, 1904, the Ode was chosen as Newfoundland&#x27;s official national anthem. This distinction was dropped when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. Three decades later, in 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem, the first province to do so. The Ode is still sung at public events to this day as a tradition. Typically, only the first and last verses are sung.

<doc id="700016" wikidata="Q784100" url="?curid=700016" title="Warlord (DC Comics)">
<text>The Warlord is a sword and sorcery character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer-artist Mike Grell, he debuted in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #8 (November 1975). The titular character, Travis Morgan, obtains the name &quot;Warlord&quot; as he fights for the freedom of the people of Skartaris.

==Development==
Grell described the Warlord&#x27;s genesis &quot;as a comic strip called &quot;Savage Empire&quot;... &quot;Savage Empire&quot; was born of my admiration for Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and Burne Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot;, combined with my fascination with archaeology and lost civilizations&quot;. Grell described pitching his idea to DC Comics: &quot;I completely revised the concept from &quot;Savage Empire&quot; into &quot;The Warlord&quot;. The story of an archeologist who stumbles through a time portal and winds up in Atlantis became the story of US spy pilot whose SR-71 is damaged while on a mission over Russia and plunges through an opening at the North pole into the world at the center on the earth, where creatures of from mythology and Earth&#x27;s ancient past co-exist amid fantastic cities and leftovers of the civilization of Atlantis... drawing on many sources, including my own US Air Force experiences to lend a note of authenticity to the characters background. Choosing the new setting was easy, as a kid one of my favorite books was Jules Verne&#x27;s 1864 classic &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, I [also] drew on...&quot;The Smoky God, The Hollow Earth&quot;, and Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Pellucidar&quot; series&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character the Warlord debuted in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #8 (cover-dated November 1975). where the character Travis Morgan, a U.S. Air Force pilot, discovers a passage into a world called Skartaris through the Earth&#x27;s North Pole. Subsequent to that first issue, the &quot;Warlord&quot; series tells of Morgan&#x27;s adventures in Skartaris. The decision to give the Warlord his own series had already been made by the time his &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; debut went into production. 

He starred in &quot;The Warlord&quot; #1 (February 1976), followed by an eight-month hiatus after issue #2, picking up again with #3 (November 1976). The title lasted 133 issues until Winter 1988. Creator Mike Grell wrote and drew the comic for six years, handing over the art chores after issue #59 (July 1982). Issues #53 through #71 were ghost-written by Grell&#x27;s then-wife Sharon Wright.

Skartaris debuted in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #8 (November 1975), 

===Backup features===
A continuation of Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;OMAC&quot; series, by Jim Starlin, was featured as a backup for several issues (#37–39 and #42–47). &quot;Arak, Son of Thunder&quot;, created by Roy Thomas and Ernie Colón, first appeared in a special insert in &quot;The Warlord&quot; #48 (August 1981). Claw the Unconquered appeared in a two–part backup feature in issues #48–49 by Jack C. Harris and Thomas Yeates. &quot;Dragonsword&quot; was a backup feature by Paul Levitz and Yeates which appeared in #51–54 (November 1981–February 1982). &quot;Arion&quot;, a sword and sorcery title by writer Paul Kupperberg and artist Jan Duursema, began as a six–page backup feature in &quot;The Warlord&quot; #55 (March 1982). Another backup feature was &quot;The Barren Earth&quot; by writer Gary Cohn and artist Ron Randall, which was concluded in a four–issue limited series. A Bonus Book in issue #131 (September 1988) featured artist Rob Liefeld&#x27;s first work for DC.

===Volume 2===
A six-issue miniseries ran cover-dated January to June 1992. It was written by Mike Grell and penciled by Dameon Willich, with inks by Rick Hoberg (#1-3) and Tim Burgard (#4-6).

===Volume 3===
DC attempted to update &quot;The Warlord&quot; in 2006 with Bruce Jones writing and Bart Sears providing the art. This series restarted the concept, beginning with Travis Morgan arriving in Skartaris. The series left a number of story points unanswered as issue #9 finished on a cliffhanger, while the tenth and final issue had a standalone story set sometime in the future.

===Volume 4===
&quot;The Warlord&quot; returned in an ongoing series written by Mike Grell in time for the original series&#x27; 35th anniversary. The series started in April 2009, featuring art by Joe Prado and Chad Hardin. It ran for 16 issues.

==Fictional character biography==
Vietnam War veteran SR-71 pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth&#x27;s crust while flying over the north pole in 1969 and landed in the underground world of Skartaris, a place strongly reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s Pellucidar. There, Travis, wielding his .44 AutoMag pistol and joined by Shamballah&#x27;s Princess (later Queen) Tara, became The Warlord and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings. He gained various sidekicks such as Machiste, Shakira, Russian scientist Mariah Romanova, and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc, Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future.

Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to the DC character Oliver Queen, he is based more upon his creator Mike Grell, who was a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in The Warlord&#x27;s first appearance, &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #8, sporting The Warlord&#x27;s signature shaggy goatee. Grell and editor Jack C. Harris made a metafictional appearance in the story &quot;Gambit&quot; in &quot;The Warlord&quot; #35 (July 1980).

Volume 4 of the series begins with an explorer finding preserved dinosaur remains in the Himalayas. She takes the head of one to a doctor and an expedition is set up to retrieve more samples. The team is spotted by the Chinese government and flee into the caves after losing several members. They discover a portal and after walking through find themselves in Skartaris, where they encounter Travis Morgan. Morgan is attacked by a giant bird and kills it with the help of Shakira. Refugees enter Shamballah and Morgan discovers that a new god has taken over the Shadow Kingdom and has overrun Kiro, Machiste&#x27;s homeland. One of the refugees is injured and carries a gunshot wound.

Travis later battles his son Joshua, also known as Tinder, who kills him and assumes the Warlord title.

==Plot==
===&quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;===
Tsubasa Oozora is an 11-year-old elementary school student who is deeply in love with football and dreams of one day winning the FIFA World Cup for Japan. He lives together with his mother in Japan, while his father is a seafaring captain who travels around the world. Tsubasa is known as the &quot;Soccer no Moshigo&quot; which translates as &quot;heaven-sent child of football&quot;. When he was almost a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a ball. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa&#x27;s motto of &quot;The ball is my friend&quot;. Ever since he was little, he always went out with a ball. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shooting power – he astounded anyone who saw him play.

At the beginning of the story, Tsubasa and his mom both move to the city of Nankatsu, a fictional town in Shizuoka Prefecture well known for their talented elementary school football teams and where Tsubasa meets Ryo Ishizaki, a football-loving young student who often sneaks out from his mother&#x27;s public bath houses and chores to play football. He meets Sanae Nakazawa (also known as Anego) an enthusiastic girl who also loves football and helps cheer the Nankatsu high school team on and Genzo Wakabayashi, a highly talented young goalkeeper whom he soon challenges to a game in Nankatsu&#x27;s annual sports festival. He also meets Roberto Hongo, one of the best Brazilian footballers in the world who is a friend of Tsubasa&#x27;s father and who starts living with Tsubasa and his mother in order to train Tsubasa. Roberto becomes a mentor to Tsubasa and helps him to harness his football skills, convincing him to join Nankatsu Elementary School and its fledgling elementary school football team, which Roberto later coaches as he passes his techniques onto Tsubasa.

Tsubasa meets Taro Misaki, who has travelled around Japan due to his father&#x27;s job and soon joins Nankatsu. The two become the best of friends on the pitch and real life, forming a partnership soon to be renowned as the &quot;Golden Duo&quot; or &quot;dynamic duo&quot; of Nankatsu. Soon Tsubasa and his Nankatsu team start taking on the best of elementary school football, meeting such talented players as Kojiro Hyuga, Ken Wakashimazu, Jun Misugi, Hikaru Matsuyama and many others. Tsubasa&#x27;s Nankatsu squad wins numerous youth national championships and he wins the U-17 World Championships for Japan by defeating Italy 2–1, Argentina 5–4 in the group stages, France 4–4 in the semifinals and eventually defeat West Germany 3–2 in the finals before leaving the country to play in Brazil.

===&quot;World Youth&quot;===
Tsubasa leaves Japan for Brazil and starts playing, with his mentor Roberto as the manager, for São Paulo (F.C. Brancos in the anime), in Brazil&#x27;s premier professional league, Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, winning the final against Flamengo (F.C. Domingos in the anime) 4–3. While in Brazil, Tsubasa gets to meet several talented Brazilian players, such as his teammate and roommate Pepe, who comes from a humble background, as well Flamengo star striker Carlos Santana, a prodigious yet emotionless talent.

Enthusiastic football-loving youngster Shingo Aoi, whom Tsubasa once played against while in the high school national championships, leaves Japan to play football in Italy, where he hopes to play for a major Italian professional team. After arriving in Italy, however, Shingo gets tricked by a man who gives him fraudulent promises of getting him selected for an Italian team. After Shingo is taken to a badly furnished field, the man runs away, stealing all his money. Shingo realizes that he is swindled and tries hard to get his money back, doing such jobs as shoe-shining, until his enthusiastic attitude catches the eye of one of the coaches of Inter Milan (Intina in the anime), who sign him to play for their squad as an attacking midfielder.

The Japan&#x27;s youth side plays the first phase of AFC Youth Championship without Taro Misaki, Makoto Soda, Hiroshi Jito, Shun Nitta, the Tachibana brothers Masao and Kazuo and Kojiro Hyuga. After Tsubasa, Wakabayashi and Shingo join the team, it defeats Thailand 5–4 after being 4–1 down at one stage. In the second phase, Japan beats Uzbekistan 8–1, China 6–3 and Saudi Arabia 4–1. In the semifinals, Japan beats Iraq 3–0. The Japanese win the Asia Youth title beating South Korea 2–0 and qualifying for the FIFA World Youth Championship.

In the first phase, Japan defeats Mexico 2–1, Uruguay 6–5 and Italy 4–0. In the quarterfinals, they beat Sweden 1–0 and Netherlands 1–0 in the semifinal. The Japanese win in the &quot;Great Final&quot; the World Youth Championship, defeating Brazil 3–2 after extra time with Tsubasa scoring a hat-trick and the golden goal despite the fact that Brazil used a new player at the extra time called Natureza, who became the third person to score a goal on Wakabayashi from outside the goal area – the first being Karl Heinz Schneider of Germany and second being Sho Shunko of China.

Tsubasa moves from São Paulo to FC Barcelona (FC Catalunya in the anime), in the Spanish Liga, after the end of the FIFA World Youth Championship final, taking his childhood friend and now wife, Sanae. He asked her out before moving to Brazil and the couple maintained a long-distance relationship before he proposed to her after the World Youth Championship.

===&quot;Road to 2002&quot;===
While Tsubasa moves from São Paulo (Brancos in the anime) to Barcelona (Catalunya in the anime), Kojiro Hyuga is bought by Juventus FC (F.C. Piemonte in the anime). Tsubasa plays very well in training, displaying all his skills, but the Dutch coach Van Saal (Edward in the anime, inspired by Louis van Gaal, who coached Barcelona at the time) demotes him to FC Barcelona B, the reserve team that plays in the second division, because Tsubasa and Rivaul (inspired by Rivaldo) cannot play together whilst Rivaul holds a key position for playmaking.

Meanwhile, Kojiro Hyuga plays for his first game for Juventus (Piemonte in the anime) against Parma in the Italian Serie A, but does not score because his physical imbalance is exposed by Parma defender Thoram (inspired by Lilian Thuram). Juventus coach Carlo Monetti replaces him with David Trezeguet (David Tresaga in the anime), who scores the winning goal as Juventus beat Parma 1–0.

In Germany, Genzo Wakabayashi and his Bundesliga team, Hamburger SV (Grunwald in the anime version), play against FC Bayern Munich (Routburg in the anime version), led by Karl Heinz Schneider. Wakabayashi makes many great saves, impressing players and coaches from both teams, but in an attempt to win at the final moment despite the coach&#x27;s decision to aim for a draw, Wakabayashi left the goal area to take a free kick shot that was stopped at the last second, which gave Bayern a chance to counterattack on an undefended goal, allowing them to win 2–1.

In Spain, the Liga begins and the match between Barcelona (led by Rivaul) and Valencia CF (San Jose in the anime) (who have just bought Tsubasa&#x27;s old rival Carlos Santana) ends 2–2. Tsubasa watches the match from the tribune (in the anime version, Tsubasa plays as a substitute in the match and scores a goal).

In the second stage of the Japanese J.League, Júbilo Iwata, led by Misaki, Gon Nakayama (inspired by real player Masashi Nakayama), Ishizaki and Urabe, defeat the Urawa Red Diamonds led by Hayato Igawa and Sawada, 2–1. In other J.League matches, FC Tokyo, led by Misugi, draws 1–1 with Consadole Sapporo, led by Matsuyama. In Italy, Hyuga and Aoi are bought respectively by A.C. Reggiana and A.S.D. Albese.

In Spain, Tsubasa plays three matches with FC Barcelona B and he records 12 goals and 11 assists in three matches. Tsubasa is inserted in the Barcelona lineup because of an injury of his rival Rivaul as well as the disastrous results of the Barcelona (one point in four matches) and plays the &quot;Súper Clásico&quot; against Real Madrid C.F., who have just bought his old rival Natureza. Tsubasa ends the match with three goals and three assists and Barcelona wins 6–5.

====&quot;Go for 2006&quot;====
This is the epilogue of &quot;Captain Tsubasa Road to 2002&quot; and it is composed of five chapters. This manga follows Kojiro Hyuga and Shingo Aoi in Italy. In this manga, Kojiro Hyuga was loaned out to Reggiana while Shingo Aoi was loaned out to Albese. Kojiro Hyuga makes a hard training and he makes his debut scoring a hat-trick.

===&quot;Golden-23&quot;===
While Tsubasa plays for Barcelona against Real Valladolid, recording a goal and an assist in a 2–0 win, the 23 players of Japan&#x27;s U-22 national team (&quot;The Golden-23&quot;) are convoked to play two friendly matches against Denmark and Nigeria in preparation for Summer Olympics. Two futsal players, Kazami and Furukawa, who previously played for Japan national futsal team, join the national U-22 football team and display great skills, scoring two goals in a training match. Meanwhile, the Japan U-20 side led by Takeshi Sawada win the AFC Youth Championship, defeating South Korea 6–5 on penalty kicks in the final. In Brazil, Minato Gamo, the former coach of the U-20 national team, tries unsuccessfully to convince Soga, a Japanese player who plays in CR Vasco da Gama, to join the national team. Meanwhile, Tsubasa&#x27;s wife Sanae informs him that she is pregnant. In Japan, the match with Denmark ends 4–2 with the following scorers: Misaki (J), Haas (D), Nitta (J), Nitta (J), Matsuyama (J) and Haas (D). In Germany, Hamburger SV plays a Bundesliga match and Genzo Wakabayashi is not in the line up because of the bad relationship with the coach Zeeman, starting rumors that Wakabayashi would leave Hamburger SV. A lot of teams were interested in signing Wakabayashi such as ACF Fiorentina, A.S. Roma, Bayern Munich and SV Werder Bremen.

Meanwhile, Minato Gamo wants to convince Igawa, a player who can play in all the roles (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder and forward), to join the national team. Also in Spain, Barcelona plays a league match against Real Betis and Tsubasa scores two goals and makes an assist for Rikaar. In Japan, Wakabayashi joins the national team.

The match between Japan and Nigeria begins and Nigeria plays very well, as it has two champions Ochado (who plays in Paris SG, based on Jay-Jay Okocha) and Bobang (who plays with Shingo Aoi in Albese). After some minutes from the beginning of the match, Nigeria has the first great opportunity to score the first goal in the match with a penalty kick, but the Japanese goalkeeper Genzo Wakabayashi saves in corner kick. Wakabayashi saves another shot and makes an assist for Ken Wakashimazu, who scores a goal with an overhead kick. However, Nigeria scores two goals with Bobang and Ochado. At the end of the first half, Nigeria is winning 2–1. Meanwhile, Minato Gamo convinces Gakuto Igawa to join the national team. The second half begins, the Japan attacks during the injury time Misaki scores the equalizing goal. The match ends 2–2.

In Spain, Barcelona wins 3–2 the match against Valencia led by Carlos Santana. In Japan, the match between Japan and Paraguay ends 3–0 with the following scorers: Gakuto, Wakashimazu and Nitta. In Spain, Barcelona plays against Atlético Madrid and Fersio Torres (inspired by Fernando Torres) quickly scores a goal. However, Barcelona replies quickly and Tsubasa scores two goals.

The Asia qualifications begins and Japan beats Malaysia (6–0 for the first match and 5–0 for the return match), Thailand (2–0 for the first match, 3–0 for the return match) and Bahrain (3–0 for the first match and 5–0 for the return match) and qualifies to the third round. In the third round, Japan beats Vietnam 5–0, draws against Saudi Arabia 1–1 and loses against Australia 3–1. Standings after day 3 (of 6): Australia 9, Japan and Saudi Arabia 4 and Vietnam 0. Only the first classified is admitted to Olympic Games. In the day 4, Japan defeats Saudi Arabia 2–0 while Australia defeats Vietnam 5–0. In day 5, Japan defeats Vietnam 4–0 and Australia draws against Saudi Arabia 1–1. Standings after day 5 (of 6): Australia 13, Japan 10, Saudi Arabia 5 and Vietnam 0. In the last day, Japan plays against Australia (had Japan defeated Australia 3–0, 4–1, 5–2 and 6–3 or more, it would have qualified to Olympic Games, while had Japan won 3–1, 4–2, 5–3 or such, it would have played a playoff against Australia). Japan scores the first goal of the match against Australia, thanks to Tachibana brothers. However, the Tachibana brothers get injured and are substituted by Wakashimazu and Nitta, who scores another goal. Japan tries to score the third goal, but all their shots hit the bar or are saved by the goalkeeper. In the second half, Australia scores the goal of 2–1, but Japan reacts and scores two goals (scorers: Igawa and Misaki). Japan ultimately wins 4–1 and qualifies to Olympic Games.

====Italy====
One-shot released in Japan in 2009, which comprises 24 chapters. This one-shot tells the Serie C1 final season match between Reggiana and Albese, with both teams directly vying for promotion. This match is the challenge between Kojiro Hyuga (Reggiana) and Shingo Aoi (Albese). Hyuga scores two goals in the first half, showing to be strongly improved in physical game. However, in the second half, Albese reacts and scores two goals. Hyuga eventually scores the victory goal in the last minute, allowing his team to be promoted into Serie B. Albese is disappointed for its defeat because they wrongly think that U.C. AlbinoLeffe won against Ravenna F.C and overtook them in standings. However, Albinoleffe lost 2–1 to Ravenna, tying both teams in third place, and this means that both Reggiana (1st) and Albese (2nd) are promoted. Both teams celebrate their promotion.

====Spain====

Tsubasa scores the draw goal with a flying drive shot in the added time and the match ends 2–2.

==Production==

Yoichi Takahashi was delighted by association football after seeing the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The matches, players, and fans&#x27; love towards the sport inspired him to write a manga about football. Another relevant aspect on this decision was the fact that Takahashi liked football more than baseball because he considered the players to have more freedom during matches. Despite football not being popular in Japan, Takahashi aimed to depict it through his manga and to reach the general public. Because of the non-popularity of the subject, getting the approval to write the manga by its publisher, Shueisha, took between 2 and 3 years, which was also difficult since it was his first manga. Rather than using professional players, the manga author instead used children as protagonists, hoping readers would identify themselves with the cast. Nevertheless, Takahashi already had in mind that through the series the main characters would grow up and become professionals.

In the making of the cast, Takahashi designed multiple characters with different traits in order to deliver multiple traits that would serve as obstacles for Tsubasa to surpass. The large number of characters made Takahashi careful with their designs and he wanted to give each of them recognizable features. One of Tsubasa&#x27;s early rivals, Jun Misugi, was given skills that surpassed the protagonist&#x27;s. As a result, he gave Misugi a heart condition that would balance the match between their teams. When asked why Tsubasa&#x27;s teams always win, Takahashi stated it was because he aims the manga to be long and thus a defeat would reduce its length. While the series was initially aimed at children, Takahashi was surprised at how, across the years, it has also attracted adults, as well as at the impact it had on Japan&#x27;s football. When talking about its themes, Takahashi stated the main one is honor, which is meant to be superior than money, something which people value more.

As Takahashi liked European football due to its competitive level, he decided to make Tsubasa leave São Paulo and join Spain&#x27;s F.C. Barcelona at the age of 21. In 1998, Takahashi traveled to Barcelona and enjoyed the Camp Nou stadium so much that he was inspired by it to make the Barcelona team Tsubasa&#x27;s future team. Nevertheless, Takahashi asserted it was a decision taken at random and joked that Tsubasa would have joined the Real Madrid if he had visited Santiago Bernabéu. For this part, Takahashi started using professional players inspired by real-life football stars, most notably Rivaul (inspired by Rivaldo) who would mentor Tsubasa in Barcelona. Due to Tsubasa&#x27;s inexperience in his debut as an adult, Rivaul becomes his mentor.

By 2010, the manga had been translated into French, Italian, German, and Spanish; at the time, no official English version existed. By 2017, several volumes were available in an official Arabic translation and a third of the first print run of these were donated to Syrian refugee children by the publisher, Kinokuniya. A bilingual Japanese-English version was released by Shueisha in 2020. It was to be released for a digital reading device.

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Yōichi Takahashi, the first &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; started in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on March 31, 1981, and finished in the May 9, 1988, issue, with its chapters collected in 37 volumes, released from January 9, 1982, to March 10, 1989. The series has spawned various one-shots and sequels. In January 2024, Takahashi announced that he would retire from serializing manga, and the series&#x27; final part, &quot;Captain Tsubasa: Rising Sun – The Final&quot;, ended on April 4, 2024. In April 2024, it was announced that &quot;Captain Tsubasa: Rising Sun&quot; would continue with a new story arc in the form of storyboards on the &quot;Captain Tsubasa World&quot; website under the title &quot;Captain Tsubasa: Rising Sun Finals&quot;; the first 27-page chapter was previewed on April 4 of the same year during the teaser site era, and the site opened on July 23 of the same year, releasing the first four chapters at once. The series is updated every Tuesday.

An official translation into Arabic was written by a Syrian man named Obada Kassoumah, who studied at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies beginning in 2012, and had enjoyed the anime as a child. Kinokuniya publishes the Arabic version and had selected Obada as the translator. Sale of the volumes began in the United Arab Emirates in 2017. To deal with differences in varieties of Arabic, Obada consulted people who spoke other varieties of Arabic and tried to make the language in the comic accessible to speakers of all varieties while avoiding stilted formality in Modern Standard Arabic. Additionally, he made instances of alcoholic beverages ambiguous as explicit depictions of alcohol would not be published in various majority Muslim countries.

==Reception and legacy==
The manga series had a circulation of volumes within Japan by 2008, 82 million copies worldwide by 2018, and had over 90 million copies in circulation worldwide by 2023. In 2001, the anime series was ranked 49th in &quot;Animage&quot;″s &quot;Top 100&quot; anime productions list. The anime adaptation has also been very popular in Japan. In 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a &quot;Top 100&quot; online web poll and nationwide survey: &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; placed 41st in the online poll and thirtieth in the survey. In 2006, TV Asahi conducted another online poll for the top one hundred anime and &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; placed 16th on &quot;The Celebrity List&quot;. The third television series was also highly popular in 2002, earning high ratings.

&quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; has inspired prominent footballers such as Hidetoshi Nakata, Alessandro Del Piero, Fernando Torres, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi, Alexis Sánchez and Andrés Iniesta to play football and choose it as a career. It also influenced Stephen Chow&#x27;s film &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; (2001) and a line of Adidas running shoes. Manga group Clamp have also produced dōjinshi works related with the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; characters.

In 2004, when the JSDF provided humanitarian assistance in Samawah, Iraq, stickers of characters from the manga were posted on &quot;twenty-six water wagons&quot; which became known by the children. The news was reported as an example of how Japanese pop culture could have positive results for &quot;cultural diplomacy and regional promotion.&quot;

A bronze statue of Tsubasa Oozora was erected in the neighborhood of the anime&#x27;s creator in Katsushika, Tokyo in spring 2013. Tsubasa and Misaki appeared in the video for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics at the closing ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Tsubasa and Misaki performed their twin shot in one scene and Tsubasa appeared on his own later with his signature overhead kick. In a match from Japan for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Japanese fans held a tifo featuring an illustration from the manga with multiple messages that supported the team.

Nippon.com (of the Nippon Communications Foundation) also made an article where they noted how Tsubasa became one of the most likeable fictional characters due to his dream and career in the series which at the same time influenced others. Espin Of noted one of the series&#x27; most notable features was how Tsubasa&#x27;s skills allowed him to perform goals while his training with his teammates also generated appeal to the viewers. His passion for the football and initial relationship with goalkeeper Genzo Wakabayashi was also noted to be worthy notes. THEM Anime Reviews noted that Tsubasa obtained a highly international reputation but found the animation from the 1980s dated in the modern times. Additionally, he found Kojiro Hyuga&#x27;s actions and his trainer&#x27;s drinking problems might leave negative impressions on viewers. Nevertheless, they found the story appealing and wished it was licensed for an English release. PublishersWeekly.com highly praised the series, stating that its surprising length proves the success of the series. Additionally, the manga was noted not for only bringing style to football, but also likeable characters which were rightfully adapted in the anime series. In &quot;The Imperial Sportive: Sporting Lives in the Service of Modern Japan&quot;, Sandra Collins acknowledges &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; and Takehiko Inoue&#x27;s &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; as manga that helped to popularize football and basketball, respectively, in Japan during their serializations. Similarly, Miho Koishihara referred to these two manga as responsible for increasing the popularity of their respective sports with the writer noting that &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; focused on realistic growth in comparison to previous works. In &quot;Sport, literature, society : cultural historical studies&quot; noted the appeal of both the manga and its title character as one of the main reasons for becoming one of Japan&#x27;s most popular soccer series referencing its popularity throughout its serialization.

A series on which &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; exerted a great influence was Masaya Tsunamoto&#x27;s &quot;Giant Killing&quot;.

During the US occupation of Iraq, the Japan Self-Defense Force put Captain Tsubasa stickers on their water trucks. At the same time, the Japan Foundation provided an Arabic-dubbed season of Captain Tsubasa to the largest television station for free.

In late 2018, the Katsushika City organized the &quot;Captain Tsubasa Cup, Gotta Win!&quot; campaign during the yearly Junior Soccer Tournament to help bring tourists to the city and keep young men active, and gave Takahashi the &quot;Honorary Citizen Award&quot; for the manga&#x27;s positive impact on the city.

<text>Northeast Texas is a cultural and geographic region in the northeast corner of the U.S. state of Texas. Geographically centered on two metropolitan areas strung along Interstate 20—Tyler in the west and Kilgore, Longview, Marshall to the east, the areas of Greenville, Mount Pleasant, Sulphur Springs, Paris, and Texarkana in the north primarily along Interstate 30, and Jacksonville and Palestine to the south are also major cities within the region. Most of Northeast Texas is included in the interstate region of the Ark-La-Tex. 

The region is unique in that it is the only portion of East Texas that is not within the direct sphere of influence of either Dallas/Fort Worth or Houston. This generally weakens the area&#x27;s visibility as areas in the far south ally themselves with Houston and areas to the west ally themselves with Dallas. These areas are on the fringe of those cities&#x27; spheres of influence, so are not as visible as smaller cities such as Grapevine or Deer Park, which are closer to the respective centers of power.

In the mid-19th century, Marshall and Jefferson constituted a sphere of influence that led the entire state into the Confederate States of America, and during the Mexican and Republic periods, Nacogdoches and San Augustine were the most developed and influential cities in Northeast Texas. Nacogdoches rebelled against Mexican rule in the Fredonian Rebellion and had one of the first newspapers to run the phrase &quot;Remember the Alamo!;&quot; while none of these three cities is a major population center in its own right on the state level any longer, all four are still major cultural centers, with Nacogdoches and Tyler being well-established centers of higher learning. Many of the largest cities in Northeast Texas still follow a rural Southern way of life, especially in dialect, mannerisms, religion, and cuisine.

==Geography==
The geography of Northeast Texas is composed mainly of the Piney Woods, a mixed forest of deciduous and conifer flora. The Piney Woods cover of gently rolling or hilly forested land. These woods are part of a much larger region of pine-hardwood forest that extends into Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Northeast Texas lies within the Gulf Coastal Plain and receives more rainfall, 35 to 50 in (890 to 1270 mm), than the rest of Texas.

The Sabine River is the major river in Northeast Texas, and flows through Longview and several other cities. The Red River also flows through the region and forms the northern border with Oklahoma and a portion of Arkansas. In Northeast Texas and the rest of South, small rivers and creeks collect into swamps called &quot;bayous&quot; and merge with the surrounding forest. Bald cypress and Spanish moss are the dominant plants in bayous. The most famous of these bayous in Northeast Texas is the Cypress Bayou surrounding the Big, Little, and Black Cypress Rivers around Jefferson. They flow east into Caddo Lake and the adjoining wetlands cover the rim and islands of the lake.

Some of the major lakes in the area include: Jim Chapman Lake, Lake Tawakoni, Lake Fork, Cedar Creek Reservoir, Pat Mayse Lake, Lake Palestine, Caddo Lake, Lake O&#x27; the Pines, and Wright Patman Lake.

The climate of the region is warmer and wetter than most of Texas and its geography is more hilly and forested. Its culture is similar to that of Southeast Texas, but does not have as much of a Cajun influence.

=== Largest cities ===
==Culture==
Culturally, Northeast Texas is more closely akin to Arkansas, Louisiana, and even Mississippi than it is to West Texas. Northeast Texas is in the Bible Belt creating a strong Fundamentalist Christian sentiment. During the Civil Rights movement several communities clashed over integration. In presidential elections since 1950, both Smith County (county seat Tyler) and Gregg County (county seat Longview) have been reliably Republican.

Much of modern Northeast Texas culture has its roots in traditions that go back for generations. First Monday Trade Days is a monthly flea market held in Canton, Texas. The market is actually held on the Thursday through Sunday &quot;preceding&quot; the first Monday of each month. It purports to be the largest and oldest continually operated flea market in the United States, and is a popular event in the area.

The East Texas Oil Museum, located on the campus of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Texas, houses the authentic recreation of oil discovery and production in the early 1930s from the largest oil field inside U.S. boundaries.

Tyler has a rich culture and has been nicknamed the &quot;Rose Capital of America&quot; because of its large role in the rose-growing industry; about 20% of commercial rose bushes produced in the U.S. are grown in Tyler and Smith counties and more than half of the rose bushes are packaged and shipped from the area. It boasts the nation&#x27;s largest municipal rose garden and hosts the Texas Rose Festival each October, which draws more than 100,000 spectators annually and has garnered nationwide attention.

The Northeast Texas Children&#x27;s Museum is located in Commerce. The museum provides playful and creative learning experiences for children in the Northeast Texas area. Many school districts from the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and the Northeast Texas area take field trips to the museum.

== Economy ==
The economy of Northeast Texas is primarily centered within the Tyler and Longview metropolitan statistical areas, the latter within the Ark-La-Tex region alongside the Texarkana metropolitan area. Within the Tyler and Longview conurbation, Brookshire Grocery Company operates as a multistate conglomerate owning Brookshire&#x27;s and Super1Foods; other major corporations with a presence in the area include Synthesizers.com, Eastman Chemical, AAON Coil Products, AT&amp;T, and Walmart.

==Higher education==

Northeast Texas has a number of higher-education institutions, including The University of Texas at Tyler, Texas A&amp;M University at Commerce, Texas A&amp;M University at Texarkana, Stephen F. Austin State University located in Nacogdoches, East Texas Baptist University, LeTourneau University, eight public and two private community colleges, a branch of the Texas State Technical College at Marshall, three historically black colleges, and a number of church-affiliated private institutions. The public colleges and universities of the region also collaboratively provide degree and course opportunities through the Northeast Texas Consortium of Colleges and Universities.

The community colleges of Northeast Texas share a history of emerging from the &quot;junior college&quot; movement of schools focused on providing the first two years of the college degree. Although most added technical programs with associate of applied science degrees following the community college movement of the 1960s, the schools still place a strong emphasis on liberal arts and the academic associate of arts and associate of science degree programs. They often include the full range of college sports, including football, and host dormitories, and are known for their &quot;high kicking&quot; drill teams. Community colleges in the region include Kilgore College, Paris Junior College, Northeast Texas Community College near Mt. Pleasant, Texarkana College, Panola College in Carthage, Tyler Junior College, Trinity Valley Community College in Athens and with campuses in Terrell and Palestine, and Angelina College in Lufkin. Jacksonville hosts the two smaller private two-year colleges of the region, Jacksonville College (Baptist) and Lon Morris College.

<doc id="700040" wikidata="Q3072812" url="?curid=700040" title="Firearms (video game)">
<text>Firearms is a first-person shooter mod for &quot;Half-Life&quot; which originated from a &quot;Quake&quot; modification. Initially developed in 1998, &quot;Firearms&quot; was created as a quasi-realistic team-based FPS. The mod&#x27;s main feature is the large amount of usable weapons in the game.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Firearms&quot;, players are divided into red and blue teams and are tasked with completing objectives. Objectives can vary from controlling areas to destroying objects. The main objective in all maps is to reduce the number of the opponent team&#x27;s reinforcements to zero. Reinforcements determine the number of times players on a team can respawn. A team loses reinforcements when killed players respawn. The loss of reinforcements on a team can be stifled by completing map objectives and the direct and indirect actions of medics on the team. As long as a team has more than 0 reinforcements, players can respawn instantly. Firearms was the first FPS game to feature player-deployed parachutes.

Unlike other games, players are free to choose what weapons they want to use. There are no classes (although players can choose predefined and editable weapon configurations) or a money system used to buy weapons. Instead, Firearms uses a credit system where every player can spend 30 credits on weapons. Every player receives a free knife regardless of the weapons configuration they choose. Players can spend their credits on weapons and equipment, ammunition is free and can be obtained from ammunition boxes available throughout most maps for when a player runs out.

Players can buy skills by spending skill points. Every player starts out with 1 skill point and can earn another skill point for every 10 points they have. No more than 7 skill points can be obtained this way. The skill points can be used to buy skills which help the player. There are seven different skills to choose from, three of which have a follow-up skill.

===Map objectives===

There are five map objectives:
* CTI (Capture The Intelligence) – Known in other games as Capture The Flag. Players have to pick up an object (usually a suitcase) and bring it to their designated capture area. The opposing team can shoot down the player carrying the object after which it will drop to the ground to be picked up by another player or left to respawn when it is not picked up for a certain amount of time. Once brought inside the team&#x27;s capture area, the team receives reinforcements and/or point depending on the map.
* PS (Push) – Players have to control a series of areas (marked with flags) in a particular order to complete the map objective. On most maps, the areas are situated near both teams&#x27; spawn area and closer to the center on the map, usually counting between 3 and 5 control areas. Depending on the map, teams are rewarded with reinforcements for capturing an area which was neutral or controlled by the opposite team. Teams can also receive reinforcement penalties when the team does not control more than half of the control areas. When one team controls all the areas in the map, that team is rewarded with reinforcements and/or points.
* SD (Search &amp; Destroy) – The map objective in SD maps is to destroy certain objects which are usually located near the opposing team&#x27;s spawning area. Objects range from crates with ammunition and guns to trucks. Some objects can be destroyed by simply doing damage to it, while others have to be destroyed with a claymore mine.
* TC (Territorial Control) Teams are rewarded with points and/or reinforcements when they control certain areas. Unlike the Push mode, players can capture any area regardless of which team controls the other areas. On some maps, players are awarded with points for every 30 seconds they control an area while on other maps, teams are rewarded with reinforcements every 30 seconds when every single area is controlled by that team.
* OBJ (Objective) – The last type of objective is a collective of objectives that do not fall under the other four types, or is a combination of different types of objectives. On most obj maps, players have to plant bombs in order to destroy certain map areas. The bombs can be defused within 30 seconds by the opposing team to prevent this.

==Development==
Though development of the Quake version began in 1998, the Half-Life version of the mod was first publicly released in April, 2000. Version 2.1 was released on July 7, 2000. The final build is Release Candidate (RC) 3.0 which was released on April 18, 2005. FA was originally created by Caspar Milan Nielsen, Christian Øelund, and Brian Fuller. Versions 2.0 through (RC) 2.5 were developed under the leadership and lead programming of Eric Smith (Zerk). Firearms 2.4 was included in the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; retail package and was later awarded &quot;PC Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Mod of the Year award and &quot;PC Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Best Multiplayer Game of the Year Runner-up in the year 2000. Firearms was at one time the #3 most popular mod based on the Half-Life engine, after &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;. Later versions, (RC) 2.6 through (RC) 3.0, were developed under the direction of Ben Irwin and Alex Jordan.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Firearms&quot; the best mod of 2000. ModDB named it a runner up for Most Improved Mod of 2002.

<doc id="700044" wikidata="Q7685823" url="?curid=700044" title="Targa Newfoundland">
<text>Targa Newfoundland, the ultimate tarmac-based car rally in North America, began in 2002 in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and races over scenic coastal roads and through towns and outports. The event covers about in September of each year on eastern and central parts of the island of Newfoundland. The next Targa Newfoundland rally will be held September 11-18, 2025.

The rally gives the owners of historic, classic and modern performance vehicles the opportunity to drive them the way they were designed to be driven in a rally competition. In the event, each team of driver and co-driver competes against itself on a handicap basis as well as against other vehicles. 

Timed stages are run on public roads, which are closed to other traffic during this time. Some stages, such as Gander and Brigus, race through towns and outports. 

Targa Newfoundland is divided into four divisions: 

* Targa Tour, a non-competitive event which allows the owners of classic and exotic cars to drive them the way they were meant to be driven, within the limits prescribed by the event, without the stress of competition;
* Grand Touring, a time-speed-distance rally (TSD Rally) emphasizing precision in maintaining the average speed set by the organizers;
* Targa 1 and 2, competitive events where the objective is to meet or slightly better the stage times set by the organizers for the age, displacement and modification level of the vehicle. Targa 1 is for cars without roll cages while Targa 2 is for cars with roll cages. Every competitor who completes all stages within the established trophy times wins a Targa plate.

Trophies are awarded for overall placing in the Touring and Targa events, and for placing within the various categories within the Targa event. There are also trophies for national and marque teams, and for the best-placed novice team.

Targa Newfoundland is made possible though the efforts of dozens of volunteers and residents of 70+ Newfoundland communities.

==Event format==

Targa Newfoundland begins and ends in the city of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. This is the tentative format for the 2025 event (subject to changes):

== Event History ==
After competing in the Targa Tasmania in Australia in 2001, Canadian automotive journalist Jim Kenzie and public relations executive Doug Mepham were inspired to bring the excitement of that rally event closer to home. As Jim wrote in Toronto Star Wheels, “We got talking and thought: Island; welcoming population; needs tourism dollars. How about Targa Newfoundland?”  

Kenzie wrote about the idea and Mepham sent the article to Robert Giannou, a businessman and racing enthusiast who had promoted Formula Atlantic races in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 1970s. Giannou got the support of the provincial government and put the organization in place. A year-and-a-half later, Targa Newfoundland was born. Targa ran for the first time in 2002 and there have been 23 runnings of the famous road rally since then.   

Robert Giannou was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame Class of 2022 as a competitor, builder and significant contributor. Robert joined an elite group of more than 290 members who have been recognized for their contributions to motorsports in Canada.  

Giannou joined the St. John’s Motor Club in 1958, where he began organizing rally, solo and hillclimb events in 1962. Giannou also raced himself, winning titles in club karting and rallying, hillclimb and B Sedan. He brought the club into the Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs (CASC) ranks and negotiated with the U.S. Embassy in Newfoundland to use two of their properties for events, including runways at Naval Station Argentia, where he eventually brought the Molyslip Endurance Series. 

Giannou has held various roles with CASC over the years, including Race Director Atlantic Region and Assistant National Race Director, most notably starting Targa Newfoundland in 2002. 

Without Robert’s vision and guidance, we wouldn’t have such an exceptional event today that challenges drivers, cars, and teams, and brings communities across the island of Newfoundland together for the love of motorsport. In 2010, he worked with Janet Brake to create a safety protocol that made Targa Newfoundland the safest of the three main Targa events, with incident rates reduced from 17% to 1.5%.

<doc id="700051" wikidata="Q105291974" url="?curid=700051" title="Complex question">
<text>A complex question, [[trick question]], multiple question, fallacy of presupposition, or (Latin, &#x27;of many questions&#x27;) is a question that has a complex presupposition. The presupposition is a proposition that is presumed to be acceptable to the respondent when the question is asked. The respondent becomes committed to this proposition when they give any direct answer. When a presupposition includes an admission of wrongdoing, it is called a &quot;loaded question&quot; and is a form of entrapment in legal trials or debates. The presupposition is called &quot;complex&quot; if it is a conjunctive proposition, a disjunctive proposition, or a conditional proposition. It could also be another type of proposition that contains some logical connective in a way that makes it have several parts that are component propositions.

Complex questions can but do not have to be fallacious, as in being an informal fallacy.

==Complex question fallacy==

The complex question fallacy, or &quot;many questions fallacy&quot;, is context dependent; a presupposition by itself does not have to be a fallacy. It is committed when someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. For example, &quot;Is Mary wearing a blue or a red dress?&quot; might be fallacious because it artificially restricts the possible responses to a blue or red dress, when in fact Mary might be wearing a different coloured dress, or trousers, or a skirt. If the person being questioned would not necessarily consent to those constraints, the question is fallacious.

Hence we can distinguish between:
* legitimately complex question (not a fallacy): a question that assumes something that the hearer would readily agree to. For example, &quot;Who is the monarch of the United Kingdom?&quot; assumes that there is a place called the United Kingdom and that it has a monarch, both true.
* illegitimately complex question: &quot;Who is the King of France?&quot; would commit the complex question fallacy because while it assumes there is a place called France (true), it also assumes France currently has a king (false). But since answering this question does not seem to incriminate or otherwise embarrass the speaker, it is complex but not really a loaded question.

When a complex question contains &quot;controversial&quot; presuppositions (often with loaded language—having an unspoken and often emotive implication), it is known as a loaded question. For example, a classic loaded question, containing incriminating assumptions that the questioned persons seem to admit to if they answer the questions instead of challenging them, is &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; Whether the person questioned answers &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, they imply that they have previously beaten their wife. A loaded question may be asked to trick the respondent into admitting something that the questioner believes to be true, and which may in fact be true. So the previous question is &quot;loaded&quot;, whether or not the respondent has actually beaten their wife–and if the respondent answers anything other than &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in an attempt to deny having beaten their wife, the questioner can accuse them of &quot;trying to dodge the question&quot;. The very same question may be loaded in one context, but not in the other. For example, the previous question would not be loaded were it asked during a trial in which the defendant has already admitted having beaten one&#x27;s wife.

===Similar questions and fallacies===
A similar fallacy is the double-barreled question. It is committed when someone asks a question that touches upon more than one issue, yet allows only for one answer.

This fallacy can be also confused with (begging the question), which offers a premise no more plausible than, and often just a restatement of, the conclusion.

<doc id="700057" wikidata="Q7895219" url="?curid=700057" title="University of Cambridge Philharmonic Orchestra">
<text>The University of Cambridge Philharmonic Orchestra (UCPO) is a British amateur orchestra and a student-run orchestra in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom.

UCPO is a non-audition orchestra. Membership is aimed primarily at members of the University of Cambridge, although the orchestra usually counts among its members a significant number of other residents of Cambridge. Only conductors and soloists are auditioned.

The orchestra usually performs five concerts in each year. Three of these feature the full orchestra. A further two are performed by a smaller group officially known as the &#x27;University of Cambridge Philharmonia&#x27;, informally known as &#x27;Baby&#x27;.

2015/16 repertoire included selections from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Nutcracker Suite danced by representatives of Cambridge University Ballet Club (as part of UCPO&#x27;s inaugural &#x27;Gala Concert&#x27;), Strauss&#x27; Fledermaus Overture, Elgar&#x27;s &#x27;Cello Concerto in E minor, Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and Dvorak&#x27;s Violin Concerto. Previous repertoire is just as varied, and has included Brahms, Sibelius, Bizet, Shostakovich and Haydn.

==History==
UCPO was founded in the early 1990s as the West Cambridge Symphony Orchestra, WCSO.

The orchestra was started as an offshoot of Fitzwilliam College Music Society (FCMS), which provided grants to help fund the early years. Members were taken principally from Fitzwilliam, Churchill and New Hall colleges. In 1995, the orchestra broke its ties with Fitz and expanded, rehearsing in Peterhouse and taking musicians from any college. The original role of WCSO is now filled by The Orchestra on the Hill.

In the early years following the split from Fitz, WCSO was organised in a relatively informal way, regularly making a loss that was recouped each year by combining the Easter concert with a garden party and &#x27;giving away&#x27; drinks to those guests who &#x27;bought raffle tickets&#x27;. Each treasurer had to cover losses personally. This situation started to resolve from 1998 onwards, with the creation of a specific orchestral bank account and a greater emphasis on publicity.

After this, WCSO started to grow and change in character, with an increasingly formal committee structure, more ambitious programmes, and an increasing sense of professionalism. Rehearsals outgrew most college rehearsal rooms, and the Wesley Methodist Church was chosen as a venue from 1999. Throughout, the orchestra remained committed to the principle of having no auditions, and accepting anyone for whom there was a musical part.

An increasingly large membership brought new musical opportunities, but also new limits in which pieces could be attempted. Sectional pieces were introduced in an attempt to give everyone a chance to play, before the decision was made to start a chamber orchestra to increase the possible range. The West Cambridge Sinfonia, or &#x27;Baby&#x27; as it quickly became known, has grown rapidly since its introduction.

In 2001, the orchestra moved to a new home at Selwyn College, rehearsing in the Selwyn Diamond.

At the start of 2002, and after a lively debate at the AGM, the decision was made to change the name of the orchestra to UCPO. The principal argument was that the orchestra was no longer tied to West Cambridge physically.

UCPO&#x27;s ties with Cambridge colleges ended in 2007, apart from the current rehearsal space for the Philharmonia, Queens&#x27; College, and some concert venues. Since October 2007, the main orchestra has rehearsed at St Giles&#x27; Church.

<doc id="700059" wikidata="Q720584" url="?curid=700059" title="Charles Foster (Ohio politician)">
<text>Charles William Foster Jr. (April 12, 1828January 9, 1904) was a U.S. Republican politician from Ohio. Foster was the 35th governor of Ohio, and later went on to serve as Secretary of the Treasury under Benjamin Harrison. From 1871 to 1879, he served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Biography==

Foster was born outside of Tiffin, Ohio, and grew up in the western Seneca County boomtown of Rome. This town would merge in 1854 with the nearby town of Risdon to form one city, named Fostoria in honor of Charles W. Foster Sr., his father.

=== Congress ===
He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1870, serving from 1871 to 1879. He was defeated for re-election in 1878.

=== Governor ===
He was elected to the governorship a year later, serving two two-year terms between 1880 and 1884.

=== Treasury Secretary ===
Foster was unsuccessful in a bid to return to the House in 1890, but was appointed by Benjamin Harrison a year later to become Secretary of the Treasury upon the death of William Windom. Foster served out the remainder of Harrison&#x27;s term before retiring. From 1891 to 1893, future Postmaster General Robert Wynne served as his personal secretary.

During the transition, after Grover Cleveland won the presidential election, Harrison intimidated to the United States Congress that there was a pending economic crisis. He also ignored the urging of individuals such as J.P. Morgan to take steps to reassure investors. One of the first clear signs of financial crisis came on February 20, 1893, twelve days prior to Cleveland&#x27;s inauguration, when receivers were appointed for the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which had greatly overextended itself. Harrison and Foster did not take action, instead leaving the financial crisis at Cleveland&#x27;s feet. Instead of addressing the economic crisis, Foster spent his final days as secretary posing for his official portrait. Republicans would ultimately go on to subsequently blame Cleveland for causing the economic downturn that he had, in actuality, inherited from the Republican Harrison.

=== Family ===
Charles Foster was married November 7, 1853 to Ann M. Olmstead of Fremont, Ohio. They had two daughters, Jessie and Anna.

==Death==
On January 8, 1904, aged 75, Foster planned to attend the inauguration of Governor Myron T. Herrick. He stopped overnight at the home of his old friend, General J. Warren Keifer, in Springfield, Ohio. He died at Keifer&#x27;s home the next day.

<text>The [[FIA]] Junior WRC Championship, is an international rallying series restricted to drivers under 29 years old, running within the framework of the World Rally Championship. The series is governed by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) and promoted by M-Sport Ltd.

Run annually since 2013, the championship is the latest in the FIA&#x27;s junior driver category which began in 2001 with the Super 1600 Championship, the Junior World Rally Championship in 2002, and the WRC Academy in 2011. This category has been a stepping stone in the careers of WRC champions Sebastien Loeb and Sébastien Ogier; plus leading drivers Dani Sordo, Elfyn Evans, Craig Breen and Thierry Neuville.

Junior WRC differs from the WRC support championships, WRC2 and WRC3, as the competition is managed and promoted by M-Sport under contract to the FIA. All cars are identical, provided and serviced by M-Sport on the entrants&#x27; behalf. The car used since 2022 is the company&#x27;s Ford Fiesta Rally3. The championship currently consists of five select rallies of the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) calendar. FIA Championship titles are awarded to the winning Driver and Co-Driver.

The FIA did not award Junior WRC champion titles in the 2022 season. Instead, the titles of FIA WRC3 Junior were awarded to the winners of the Junior WRC competition run by M-Sport.

==History==
The championship&#x27;s origins began in 2001 as the FIA Super 1600 Drivers&#x27; Championship, and included six events in Europe. Sébastien Loeb was the series&#x27; champion, driving a Super 1600 Citroën Saxo. The series became the Junior World Rally Championship the following year, with an upper age limit of 29 introduced in 2003.

In 2007, the championship did not include events outside Europe. Following introduction of an FIA rule in 2006 surrounding use of the word &#x27;world&#x27; in championship names, the championship was known as the FIA Junior Rally Championship (JRC) for one season only. The 2010 season was the last Junior World Rally Championship.

In 2011, the FIA replaced the championship with the WRC Academy Cup. This was the first year the championship was managed under contract. M-Sport provided identical Ford Fiesta R2 cars for entrants to use. In 2013 the series was renamed to FIA Junior WRC.

In 2014, Citroën were awarded the contract to run Junior WRC providing Citroën DS3 R3T cars. M-Sport repurposed the old Ford Fiesta R2 units for the Drive DMACK Fiesta Trophy. 

In 2017, M-Sport regained the running rights continuing to use the Ford Fiesta R2. Following the introduction of the Rally Pyramid in 2019, the latest evolution Ford Fiesta Rally4 was introduced for the second round of the 2020 season.

At the 2018 season the number of rallies were reduced to 5, while the last rally gives double points.

In March 2021 the FIA announced there will not be any two-wheel drive championships in WRC from 2022. It was later announced Rally3 cars would be used for Junior WRC from then on. The FIA title for 2022 was called WRC3 Junior, however from 2023, FIA Junior WRC was restored.

==Rules==
The Junior WRC is open to drivers under the age of 29 who have not competed as a Priority 1 (P1) driver in an FIA World Rally Championship event. Competitors drive identical Ford Fiesta Rally4 cars using Pirelli tyres. There is no obligation to enter a minimum number of rounds and all rounds contribute to the championship points tally.

The point-scoring system based on classification is the same as in the WRC, WRC2 and WRC3 championships, with points allocated to the top ten classified finishers as follows:

The last rally in the season awards double classification points to competitors who have started at least 3 previous rounds. Power Stage points are not awarded in Junior WRC as in the other WRC championships, however JWRC competitors can score one championship bonus point for each stage win during the season.

The Nations Trophy sums points of the best performing driver from each nation each round, not including stage points.

<text>The California State University Maritime Academy (Cal Maritime or CSU Maritime Academy) is a public university in Vallejo, California, United States. It is part of the California State University system and the only maritime academy on the contiguous West Coast. The university offers six bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and one master&#x27;s degree program.

Cal Maritime will merge with Cal Poly and become a subsidiary of Cal Poly on July 1, 2025. It will be known under two names: Cal Poly, Solano Campus and Cal Poly Maritime Academy.

==History==

The California Nautical School was established in 1929, when California State Assembly Bill No. 253 was signed into law by Governor C. C. Young. The bill authorized the creation of the school, the appointment of a board of governors to manage the school and the acquisition of a training vessel. The school&#x27;s mission was &quot;to give practical and theoretical instruction in navigation, seamanship, steam engines, gas engines, and electricity in order to prepare young men to serve as officers in the American Merchant Marine.&quot; By 1930, a training vessel and a school site was acquired; the original site was in Tiburon in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Due to the Great Depression, the early days of the school were full of financial uncertainty. As early as 1933, some state legislators were calling for the school&#x27;s abolition. To save money, cadets and instructors alike lived and held classes aboard the training vessel, the T.S. &quot;California State&quot;. Only after the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 did the funding for the school stabilize.

In 1939 the California Nautical School adopted the name, the California Maritime Academy. By 1940, the academy was granting Bachelor of Science degrees and Naval Reserve commissions to its graduates; this step marked the beginning of the transition from the status of trade school to college. In 1943, the academy moved to its present location in Vallejo, California.

In the 1970s, after surviving another round of budget cuts and calls for the academy&#x27;s abolition, California Maritime Academy became a four-year institution. The 1970s also marked the time when the first minority and female cadets graduated from California Maritime Academy.

In 1995, California Maritime Academy became the twenty-second campus of the California State University system. The new affiliation improved the academy&#x27;s funding prospects considerably. The current training vessel is the T.S. &quot;Golden Bear III&quot;; it is the third training ship to carry that name.

In September 2015, the California State University Board of Trustees approved a new name, the California State University Maritime Academy.

In 2024, the California State University system voted to integrate the university with California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, citing significant financial challenges and a 31% decline in enrollment over the past seven years at Cal Maritime. The integration will take place in 2025 academic year, and the land-based part of the school will be renamed &quot;Cal Poly, Solano Campus&quot; and the sea-based school will be renamed &quot;Cal Poly Maritime Academy&quot;.

===Superintendents and presidents===

Since the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1970, the position of President of the Cal Maritime is commissioned as a Rear Admiral (Upper Half) in the United States Maritime Service. Two past presidents are alumni of the academy.
#Dwyer replaced by Nichols due to Navy requirements for regular Navy officers to be in charge of Navy-owned ships
#During WWII, Superintendent and Master became separate positions
#Edwin C. Miller appointed Interim Superintendent October 1971 – July 1972
#On February 27, 1975, the title of &quot;Superintendent&quot; was changed to &quot;President&quot;

==Academics==



===Degree programs===
Cal Maritime offers one graduate and six undergraduate degrees, all of which are tied to a nautical curriculum. An additional Oceanography major was added in fall 2020. As of fall 2018 CSU Maritime had the largest enrollment percentage of Pacific Islander Americans and Multiracial Americans.

===Rankings===

&quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Cal Maritime 15th in the country for value out of 623 schools it evaluated for its 2022 Best Colleges in America ranking.

In 2019 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Cal Maritime as the 309th top college in the nation and 64th in the West.

The 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings lists Cal Maritime as the No. 1 &quot;Top Public College&quot; and tied for 2nd out of 102 schools in the category &quot;Regional Colleges (West)&quot;.

According to a study by the Equality of Opportunity Project, the Cal Maritime had the best results of any California college in helping transform students whose parents were relatively poor (bottom 20 percent of the income bracket) into adults who are relatively wealthy (top 20 percent income) within a decade after graduation. 85% of poor students eventually became relatively wealthy. However, only 6% of the students came from poor families.

==Corps of Cadets==

Cal Maritime is the United States&#x27; only maritime academy on the West Coast and requires all undergraduate students to participate in the Corps of Cadets. The only similar program in the Western United States is at the junior college New Mexico Military Institute. Since Maritime Academies comply with Title 46 Part 310 of the Code of Federal Regulations students are referred to as Cadets, required to wear uniforms, and utilize a demerit-based disciplinary system. Participation in Navy Reserve Merchant Marine training program is no longer required, but Cadets still utilize Merchant Marine Navy-style uniforms, customs, and traditions. Based on academic majors cadets are organized into Squads, Sections, Divisions and Companies which regularly muster in Morning Formations several times a week, as well as stand watches on campus and aboard the training ship.

===Military options===
There is no armed service obligation attached to graduation from the Cal Maritime. However, financial aid and additional career opportunities exist for those students who choose to participate in any of the several military programs available on the Cal Maritime campus:

*Coast Guard – Auxiliary University Program, Maritime Academy Graduate Program
*Navy – Strategic Sealift Officer Program
*Navy – Reserve Officer Training Corps
*Marine Corps – Reserve Officer Training Corps
*Air Force – Reserve Officer Training Corps

==Athletics==
The Cal Maritime athletics teams are called the Keelhaulers (formerly known as the &quot;Seawolves&quot;). The academy is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (Cal Pac) since the 1996–97 academic year.

Cal Maritime competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, crew, cross country, golf, rugby, soccer and water polo; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, crew, cross country, golf, soccer and water polo; and co-ed sports include sailing.

===History===
Cal Maritime has a long history of athletic activities. Before it joined regular intercollegiate athletics, sports teams from Cal Maritime usually played military teams from local bases. In the 1970s, Cal Maritime began to organize its sports under intercollegiate guidelines, and the student body chose the &quot;Keelhauler&quot; as the academy&#x27;s mascot. Until then, the Academy&#x27;s teams were known as the Seawolves.

===Mascot/nickname===
The Keelhauler mascot was chosen as Cal Maritime&#x27;s athletic mascot by cadets in 1974, the name taken from a form of corporal punishment that was formerly used in the Dutch and English navies. Keelhauling involved tying the hands of a crewmember to a rope and hauling him under the keel of the ship. While the practice of keelhauling was formally abolished in 1853, the Keelhauler lives on as the official mascot of Cal Maritime athletics.

===Accomplishments===
Cal Maritime&#x27;s rugby program was started in 1998 and gained varsity status in 2001. Rugby was at one time the school&#x27;s most successful sport, going undefeated against Division II opponents in home matches from 2007 to 2010. Cal Maritime&#x27;s rugby team has been nationally ranked in college rugby, won the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Western Division Championship in 2009 and 2010, and was the runner up in the 2012 championship of the National Small College Rugby Organization. During the 2004–2005 academic year, the women&#x27;s basketball team was formed and now also competes in the CalPac.

The academy&#x27;s sailing team captured their first Kennedy Cup – the National Collegiate Sailing Championship – in the fall of 2009. That victory earned it the right to serve as the U.S. representative in the annual Student World Yachting Cup championships in October 2010 in La Rochelle, France, where it placed 5th of 14.

The sailing team won the Kennedy Cup again in 2013, 2015, 2021 and 2022.

In 2012, the Varsity 4+ of the men&#x27;s crew team took first place in its event at the Head of the American Regatta. It beat teams from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, CSU Sacramento, CSU Long Beach, Humboldt State University, Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California, Sonoma State University, and the University of the Pacific. At the 2013 WIRA championships, the men&#x27;s pair placed 2nd out of 16, while the men&#x27;s novice 4+ placed 6th out of 19. Also in 2012, Cal Maritime added a men&#x27;s cross country running team that finished 5th out of 8 teams in the Cal Pac Conference.

In 2014, Cal Maritime added a women&#x27;s water polo team, followed by a women&#x27;s soccer team in 2018.

=== Spirit ===
In the fall of 2022, Cal Maritime Athletics formed a student run spirit group dubbed &quot;The Watch&quot;, playing homage to &quot;watch standing&quot;, the main duty of deck and engine officers on ships.

<text>Richard Bishop (November 4, 1812 – March 2, 1893), also known as Richard M. Bishop and Papa Richard, was an American politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. Bishop served as the 34th governor of Ohio.

==Biography==

Richard Moore Bishop was born in Fleming County, Kentucky, and received business training in his home state. He came to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1848, and had a wholesale grocery business on the Public Landing as &quot;Bishop and Wells&quot; and later &quot;R. M. Bishop and Company&quot;. In 1857 he became councilman, and 1858, president of the Council. He was Mayor from 1859 to 1861, and declined re-nomination.

While Bishop was mayor, the Prince of Wales accepted his invitation to visit the city, and, despite being a Democrat, Bishop made the address of welcome to President Lincoln as he passed through on the way to his inauguration. He presided over the great Union meeting held the first year of the war.

From 1859 to 1869, Bishop was President of the Ohio Missionary State Society, and he also served as President of the General Christian Missionary Convention. He was also a member of the Ohio Constitutional Convention of 1873. He was a mover in promoting the Cincinnati Southern Railway.

In 1877, the Democrats nominated Bishop for governor, and he defeated Republican William H. West and three other candidates with a plurality, but not majority of the votes. Bishop served a single two-year term as governor, and was not re-nominated by his party. A Democratic writer summed up his administration thus: 

Bishop died at Jacksonville, Florida, March 2, 1893.

Bishop was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery.

The university is primarily a commuter campus serving the city of Bakersfield. CSU Bakersfield&#x27;s petroleum geology program is the only one offered by a public university west of the Rockies. The university is a Hispanic-serving institution. Alumni include local, state, and federal politicians, including one former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

==History==

CSUB owes its founding to the Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960, which formalized the creation of the CSU system, initially as the &quot;California State Colleges&quot; system. The areas in the southern San Joaquin Valley had been demanding a four-year university since the 1950s. After considering several locations, including nearby Delano and parts of Kings and Tulare County, a steering committee decided on Bakersfield because it was the largest isolated metropolitan area in the United States without a four-year university at that time. Their decision was turned into a bill by Bakersfield&#x27;s State Senator Walter W. Stiern, ratified by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Pat Brown.

Under these rules, the school was authorized as Kern State College, in 1965, and founded as California State College, Bakersfield in 1968. First classes were held on October 1, 1970. In 1982, the California State College system became the California State University system. The school changed to its present name in 1988, when it was granted university status.

==Athletics==

CSU Bakersfield is currently an NCAA Division I school. The Roadrunners began the transition process in 2006 and became a full Division I member in July 2010. Following a period as one of a small number of Division I independents, CSU Bakersfield joined the Western Athletic Conference in July 2013 for most sports. For wrestling, CSUB competes in the Pac-12 conference. CSUB wrestling is the institution&#x27;s original Division-I sport and has placed 3rd (1996) and 8th (1999) in the NCAA D-I Wrestling Championships. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams compete on campus at the Icardo Center.

On June 1, 2006, CSU Bakersfield president, Dr. Horace Mitchell, formally announced that CSUB would raise $6 million over a five-year period for the additional costs for the athletics program. Part of the additional costs were to start a baseball program and a women&#x27;s golf program. In September 2011, CSUB accepted an invitation to join the Western Athletic Conference for baseball.

Rudy Carvajal was CSUB&#x27;s athletic director from 1972 until his retirement on December 31, 2010. In 2005, Carvajal received the prestigious CSU Wang Family Award. Under Carvajal&#x27;s leadership, CSUB has 30 national championships and received the Sears Directors Cup in 1998. Nearly 60,000 people attend NCAA sporting events at CSU Bakersfield.

On May 17, 2007, CSUB announced that Bill Kernen would be the school&#x27;s first baseball coach, with the school&#x27;s first official season beginning in spring of 2009.

On January 8, 2011, Jeff Konya assumed the position of athletic director.

==Student life==
===Admissions===
Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment

In fall of 2013, CSUB enrolled its largest freshman class of over 1,300 students. As of fall 2018 CSU Bakersfield has the largest enrollment percentage of unknown Americans and along with CSU Chico the second largest enrollment percentage of Native Americans in the Cal State system.

===Clubs and organizations===
CSU Bakersfield has 120 recognized student clubs and organizations (including seven Greek Organizations: Phi Sigma Sigma, Gamma Phi Beta, Nu Phi Chi, Theta Sigma Chi, Kappa Delta Nu, Delta Zeta Tau, and Kappa Sigma) as of spring 2018. Each year, the top juniors, seniors, and graduate students receive membership invitations to join Alpha Chi through the California Iota chapter of the national honor society. The Associated Students Inc. (ASI) is the recognized student government and is known for having an active role on campus. The Bakersfield campus has a Student Union and a Recreation Center.

===Enrollment and dormitories===
CSUB is predominantly a commuter school, drawing its student body from a mix of recent high school graduates in the local area and working people returning to school or pursuing a degree part-time. While the majority of students live off-campus, the campus dorms can accommodate up to 324 students, or under 5% of the 2002 enrollment figure of 7,700. Space in the dorms has historically been plentiful, with single-occupancy rooms often available and one entire dorm devoted to faculty offices through the mid-1990s. However, space is now impacted and usually fills up quickly. New dorms opened in 2015.

The six buildings comprising the original (West) dorm complex are each named after locations in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novel: Rivendell, Rohan, Entwood, Numenor, Dobry, and Lorien. Dorm facilities include a first floor lounge in each building, a dining commons, a swimming pool, a sand volleyball court, a pond, and a parking lot. CSUB has added a new dorm complex called &quot;Student Housing East&quot; on the northeast end of campus. The original dormitories have been partially repurposed for use as offices.

==Tradition==
The CSUB Fight Song and Alma Mater were selected through a structured contest initiated by the student government, Associated Students Inc. (ASI). The winner of the Fight Song Contest was a current music student, Gwendolyn Wilcox, and the winner of the Alma Mater Contest was a CSUB alumnus and current high school music instructor, Bill Ingram.

Gracin was born on October 18, 1980, to Mario and Brenda Gracin, and was raised in Westland, Michigan. He has four sisters: Stacy, April, Melissa and Kristen. He grew up listening to Elvis, the Beatles and to vintage rock and pop on a favorite local station. When he was 11 the station changed its format to country, and he was introduced to artists such as Garth Brooks, Joe Diffie, George Strait and Randy Travis. These artists&#x27; songs immediately caught his interest. &quot;There&#x27;s not another genre that better reflects situations in my life,&quot; Gracin said.
 His vocal debut was in an Easter musical presented by his local church. His first public appearance was at an eighth grade talent competition where he sang Brooks&#x27; 1993 hit &quot;Standing Outside the Fire&quot; and easily won over an audience full of more traditional dance music-loving cohorts.

Later, Gracin auditioned, as the only male, for a national pop orchestra and vocal competition, known as the Fairlane Youth Pops Orchestra, and won as a sophomore in high school. During his high school career Gracin performed at state festivals, fairs, and pageants throughout the State of Michigan. At 16, he performed on stage at the Grand Ole Opry in a national talent show and recorded a demo CD in Nashville, Tennessee.

Upon graduation from John Glenn High School in Westland, he attended Western Michigan University before he joined the United States Marine Corps. After basic training, he returned to marry his wife and was assigned to Camp Pendleton as a supply clerk.

== Career ==

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Josh Gracin&quot; ===
In 2003, Gracin auditioned for the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. He made it to the finals and eventually came in fourth place on the show. However, because of his earlier commitment to the Marine Corps, Gracin was not able to participate in the lucrative American Idol Finalists tour of American venues. Gracin was instead sent on a year-long tour as a recruiter, making appearances at special events around the United States to promote the United States Marine Corps. After completing his fourth year of service, he was honorably discharged in September 2004.

Gracin&#x27;s true transition from reality show finalist to recording star began when he sang Rascal Flatts&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot; on one episode of &quot;American Idol&quot;. As Rascal Flatts watched that episode on their tour bus, bass player Jay DeMarcus was impressed with Gracin&#x27;s talent and reached out to him. He connected Gracin with Marty Williams, who had co-produced both of Rascal Flatts&#x27; breakthrough album and its successful follow-up. That set in motion a series of events (with a short one-year break to finish his Marine stint) that led to a record deal with Lyric Street Records in 2004. His debut album &quot;Josh Gracin&quot; was released on June 15, 2004, and was certified gold. The album&#x27;s first three singles (&quot;I Want to Live,&quot; &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose,&quot; and &quot;Stay with Me [Brass Bed]&quot;), all reached the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart, with &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose,&quot; the second of those three, reaching Number One.

In 2005, Gracin also contributed the song &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot; to the &quot;&quot; soundtrack, and he also sang on &quot;When I See an Elephant Fly&quot; on the Jim Brickman album &quot;The Disney Songbook&quot;. At a performance in 2006, Gracin filled in, with good reviews, for Lonestar&#x27;s lead vocalist Richie McDonald in concert when McDonald was recovering from a back injury.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;We Weren&#x27;t Crazy&quot; ===

In March 2006, Gracin released his fourth single, &quot;Favorite State of Mind.&quot; Although it was a Top 20 hit on the country chart, Gracin&#x27;s second album was delayed. Originally slated to be titled &quot;All About Y&#x27;all&quot;, the second album was later re-titled &quot;I Keep Coming Back&quot; and then finally &quot;We Weren&#x27;t Crazy&quot;, after the title of its third single. &quot;We Weren&#x27;t Crazy,&quot; the third release from the album, entered the country music charts in October 2007, and for the chart week dated August 2, 2008 (40 weeks after it debuted on the charts), it reached a peak of number 10. The album was finally released on April 1, 2008. A fourth single, &quot;Unbelievable (Ann Marie)&quot;, was released to country radio on August 25, 2008. Gracin wrote the song about his wife. &quot;Telluride,&quot; a song originally recorded by Tim McGraw on his 2001 album &quot;Set This Circus Down&quot;, was released as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single. Gracin was dropped from Lyric Street Records following the release of &quot;Telluride.&quot;

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Redemption&quot; ===
A new song, &quot;Enough&quot;, was posted on his MySpace page on May 1, 2009, and released to radio in June 2009. According to his blog, Gracin wrote the song and enlisted Lonestar&#x27;s Dean Sams to co-produce it. &quot;Enough&quot; is his favorite song in this collection and he said, &quot;writing this song felt like a turning point artistically. I was better able to take what was going on in my head and get it onto paper in a way I feel is relatable to so many.&quot; In the entry, Gracin also said it is his first project since leaving Lyric Street Records. The second single, &quot;She&#x27;s A Different Kind Of Crazy&quot; was released in August 2009.

In January 2010, Gracin signed with Average Joe&#x27;s Entertainment. His first single under Average Joe&#x27;s, &quot;Cover Girl,&quot; was released in August 2010. Gracin&#x27;s third album, &quot;Redemption&quot;, was released on November 8, 2011. The album&#x27;s next single, &quot;Long Way to Go,&quot; became Gracin&#x27;s first single to chart on the adult contemporary chart.

== Personal life ==
Gracin was married to Ann Marie. They have three daughters: Briana Marie Gracin, born March 30, 2002; Gabriella Ann Gracin, born November 15, 2006; and Isabella Sophia Gracin, born November 12, 2008; as well as a son, Landon Joshua Gracin, born August 4, 2005. After his &quot;Idol&quot; stint and his discharge from the Marine Corps, he moved to Tennessee in pursuit of his singing career.

Relations with his wife soured. On August 14, 2014, Gracin left a goodbye note on his Facebook account interpreted by some media as being a suicide note, particularly when it was tipped off to TMZ, and the note went viral. He was placed on a psychiatric hold in a hospital, but was later released after voluntarily checking himself into an inpatient psychiatric facility. Gracin has maintained the note was not meant as a suicide note, rather as he says a &quot;poorly worded&quot; painful separation letter as his wife insisted on divorcing him. Ann Marie, his wife of 13 years, filed for divorce shortly after. Gracin shared new music, apologized and indicated he was on the road to recovery. In October 2015, Gracin became engaged to his new girlfriend Katie Weir. The couple married on May 6, 2017. The single &quot;Nothin&#x27; Like Us&quot; is reference to his new relationship.

On July 10, 2019, Gracin and Weir announced they were expecting their first child together. Their son was born on January 13, 2020.

<doc id="700101" wikidata="Q1026905" url="?curid=700101" title="California State University, Channel Islands">
<text>California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI, CSU Channel Islands) is a public university in Ventura County, California. Located near the city of Camarillo, it opened in 2002 as the 23rd campus in the California State University system. CSUCI is located on the Central Coast of California, at the intersection of the Oxnard Plain and northernmost edge of the Santa Monica Mountains range. The Channel Islands are nearby where the university operates a scientific research station on Santa Rosa Island.

The university is a Hispanic-serving institution. Channel Islands offers 63 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 12 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 4 teaching credentials. In the fall of 2020, the university enrolled 6,943 undergraduate and postgraduate students. In the fall of 2020, the university had 425 faculty, of whom 153 (or 36%) were on the tenure track.

==History==
The first buildings of the campus were built in 1934 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal during the Great Depression, a public works project to house the Camarillo State Mental Hospital and provide work for the unemployed. Construction teams utilized several thousand laborers over the course of three years in their endeavor to create everything from the hospital itself to a power plant, local utilities, and animal husbandry/farm facilities that would eventually support a complex of patients and staff numbering into the thousands during normal weekday operations. The hospital operated between 1936 and 1997.

Planning for the University began in 1965, when State Senator Robert J. Lagomarsino co-authored Senate Bill 288 calling for establishment of a four-year public college in Ventura County, and Governor Pat Brown signed a bill authorizing a study for a state college for the county. In 1974, Dr. Joyce Kennedy established the UC/CSU Ventura Learning Center in Ventura as a partnership between UC Santa Barbara and California State University, Northridge. She went on to serve as director of the CSUN Ventura Campus for more than 15 years. The Ventura Learning Center became the CSUN Ventura Campus in 1988.

In 1996, J. Handel Evans began as planning president charged with beginning development of a public, four-year university in the region. In September 1997, on the recommendation of the chancellor and a community task force appointed by the Governor, CSU&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to accept the former Camarillo State Hospital site for the purpose of transforming it into the CSU&#x27;s 23rd campus. In July 1996, CSU&#x27;s board of trustees formally adopted the name California State University Channel Islands for the new university. In September 1997, Governor Wilson signed into law S.B. 623 (Jack O&#x27;Connell) providing for the financing and support of the transition of the site for use as a university campus. The state legislature and CSU&#x27;s board of trustees provided funds to begin the conversion of the facility from a state hospital into a college campus. In 1997, the hospital closed and the patients were moved into the state-local system. In August 1999, The Ventura Learning Center moved as tenants to the Camarillo site as CSUN-CI, a satellite facility for CSU Northridge.

CSU&#x27;s board of trustees appointed Richard R. Rush the founding president of California State University Channel Islands. He started working on June 18, 2001, however Rush&#x27;s formal inauguration wasn’t held until April 19, 2002. On August 16, 2002, CSUCI opened to upper division transfer students and in the fall of 2003 it accepted its first freshman class. As of January 2006, the first named school of the campus was the Martin V. Smith School of Business &amp; Economics. On May 17, 2007, CSUCI graduated its inaugural freshman class and received its initial accreditation for seven years, the maximum period allowed by the WASC. The campus is under continuing construction to accommodate the projected growth of the university. While there were about 7,000 registered students in 2010, projected enrollment for the year 2025 is 15,000 full-time students. Rush retired in August 2016, after 15 years as the campus&#x27;s second president. He was succeeded by Erika D. Beck who previously served as Provost and Executive Vice President of Nevada State College. In November 2020, the CSU Chancellor named Erika D. Beck president of California State University Northridge (CSUN). She departed CSUCI in January 2021 and CSUCI Vice President for Student Affairs Richard Yao was appointed interim president of the university. In January 2022, Richard Yao was named the fourth permanent president of CSUCI.

=== Hispanic Serving Institution ===
CSUCI is the only four-year public university in Ventura County and in 2010 it received Hispanic Serving Institution status (HSI). The university achieved this status by moving past the threshold of having at least a 25 percent Hispanic student population. Achieving HSI status has enabled the school to compete for funding and other financial support from the U.S. Department of Education. CSUCI received approximately $16.4 million of federal support for HSI Initiatives. The Hispanic/Latino student population is 50% as of the fall of 2017.

==Campus==

The campus is located about south of the city of Camarillo, at the base of Long Grade Canyon. The school is set on rich agricultural land at the edge of the Oxnard Plain bordered by farms and nestled into the base of the Santa Monica Mountains. The flat site is marked by a lone peak called Round Mountain (the Chumash name is Sathwiwa). The state hospital was built in a remote area so roads were improved to provide for the campus traffic. The university developed a bus transit network to serve the campus with VISTA buses providing access to Gold Coast Transit in Oxnard and the Camarillo train station. Gaining official possession of the land in 1998 and then improvements began in 1999, on the existing campus-style facility, primarily one to two-story buildings organized around three primary quads. In 2007, the campus acquired an additional . Many of the buildings are in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architectural styles, although there are a few &quot;modern&quot; buildings. The campus is split into two primary sections: North Quad and South Quad. In 2012, Del Norte and Madera halls were opened in the North Quad; some of the buildings in the North Quad are still uninhabited and unsafe due to age, which became CSU Channel Islands University Park located adjacent to the campus.
===North Quad===
Development on the North Quad includes the 2012 Del Norte classroom building and Madera Hall, which primarily houses faculty. Solano Hall and the Grand and Petit salons received additional renovations in 2012 and 2019, and house offices, classrooms, and a conference center. Manzanita Hall includes classrooms for the nursing program and other various classes. Placer Hall is home to the University&#x27;s Public Safety department and located next to the Business School. Napa Hall, which includes the Mike Curb Studios opened in 2010, has classrooms for art and design students. University Hall houses the President&#x27;s Office, along with various other administrative units.

====Martin V. Smith Center for Integrative Decision-Making====
Martin V. (&quot;Bud&quot;) Smith donated $8 million to finance the construction of the Martin V. Smith Center for IDM and the first college on campus named in his honor. Additionally, his name marks The Martin V. Smith School of Business &amp; Economics, the Martin V. Smith Professorship in Land Use Studies, and the Martin V. Smith Center for Integrative Decision Making. The building opened in the spring of 2009. It features a large lecture hall and adjoining classrooms. This building is one of the few classrooms in the North Quad.

===South Quad===
Most of the campus&#x27;s redeveloped buildings are located within the South Quad area. The Bell Tower houses most of the campus classrooms and professor offices. The Bell Tower can be seen from most areas on campus because of its height and centrality.

In 2006, CSUCI students passed a referendum to fund the design, construction, and operation of the new Student Union. The Student Union includes a large programmable area for student events and live entertainment; a dining center with a coffee shop, pizzeria, sandwich deli and salad bar; lounges for informal gatherings; a game room, pool tables and computer gaming systems; and ASI offices for Student Government, Student Programming Board, The Nautical Yearbook, and the Channel Islands View (CI View) student newspaper. The Student Union also includes a courtyard for outdoor events and gatherings for the entire campus community.

===John Spoor Broome Library===

The John Spoor Broome Library was designed by architect Lord Norman Foster and named after the first major donor to campus, John &quot;Jack&quot; Spoor Broome, an Oxnard rancher and philanthropist. The library opened on April 4, 2008. It is one of the few buildings on the campus that does not represent the Spanish mission style. This complex, which is twelve times larger than the previous library, is home to 75,000 books, 180,000 electronic books, and 32,000 images of art. It also complements the campus sustainability plan by using recyclable carpeting, natural lighting and combining the new structure with the existing buildings surrounding it.

In the summer of 2002, former Congressman Robert J. Lagomarsino and his wife, Norma, established the Robert J. and Norma M. Lagomarsino Department of Archives and Special Collections, which is housed within the library. Lagomarsino, a native of Ventura County, served as mayor of Ojai in 1958, as a state senator from 1961 to 1974, and as a United States congressman from 1974 to 1992.

<text>California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH, CSU Dominguez Hills, or Cal State Dominguez Hills) is a public university in Carson, California. It was founded in 1960 and is part of the California State University (CSU) system.

In 2020, the university had an enrollment of 17,763 students, comprising 15,873 undergraduates (89.4%) and 1,890 post baccalaureates (10.6%). About half of all students identify as the first in their families to go to college. CSUDH is one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the western United States. It enrolls the largest number and percentage of African American students of any CSU campus.

CSUDH offers 53 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 26 Masters programs, a variety of single, multi-subject and specialized teaching credentials, and undergraduate, graduate, and post-baccalaureate certificate programs within its six colleges: College of Arts and Humanities, College of Business Administration and Public Policy, College of Education, College of Extended and International Education, College of Health, Human Services and Nursing, and College of Natural and Behavioral Sciences. The university is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). It is designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution.

The campus sits on the historic Rancho San Pedro, the oldest land grant in the Los Angeles area. The land was in the continuous possession of the Dominguez family through seven generations – from its concession to Juan Jose Domínguez in 1784 to its acquisition by the state of California for the university. The campus mascot is the Toro.

==History==

The foundation for what would become CSU Dominguez Hills was built in 1960 when then Governor of California Pat Brown provided state funds to begin development of the campus. It was originally to be located in Palos Verdes, California, and known as South Bay State College. The tentative name was changed to California State College at Palos Verdes in 1962. In 1964, architect A. Quincy Jones designed a master plan for construction. As the permanent campus had not yet been constructed, the first classes were held in 1965 at the California Federal Savings Bank in Rolling Hills Estates, California. The college began with an enrollment of approximately 40 students.

In 1965 the designated location for the campus was moved to the Dominguez Hills in Carson. The Palos Verdes site was abandoned due to high land prices in Palos Verdes, and the Watts Riots exposing a need for a campus to serve the populations of South Los Angeles.

The university was established, in large part, as a response to the African American outcry for higher education standards and opportunities. In October and November 1969, demonstrations regarding the Vietnam War were held on the campus. In 1977 the California Postsecondary Education Commission endorsed the college trustees&#x27; desire to change the name of the school from California State College, Dominguez Hills to California State University, Dominguez Hills.

CSUDH was selected as the host venue for 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics cycling competition. Between 1981 and 1982, the Olympic Velodrome was constructed on the campus. The US cycling team won nine gold medals on the track during the Olympics. The 333.3-meter-long track was demolished in 2003 and replaced by the ADT Event Center (now known as the VELO Sports Center) in 2004. It remains the only Olympic-standard velodrome in the United States.

In 1992, the university opened the Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Student Union. A major expansion was completed in 2007, adding the 800-seat Dominguez Ballroom. The CSUDH Extended Education Building was opened in 2000, followed by the completion of James L. Welch Hall in 2002. It was named after a long-time CSUDH faculty member.

In 2021, CSUDH opened three major new on-campus buildings, designed to expand the campus&#x27; academic capabilities and help transform the campus from a commuter school to a destination institution. The new Student Resident Housing complex can accommodate over 500 students. The complex includes double, triple, and quadruple bedrooms, a laundry room, study rooms, several lounges, and other amenities. It features eight 47-foot-high murals by Los Angeles artist iris yirei hu. The Science and Innovation Building houses the university&#x27;s chemistry, biology, and physics programs. It is also the home of the Toyota Center for Innovation in STEM Education, which includes a fabrication lab, SMART classrooms, and labs for K-12 teacher demonstrations. The campus&#x27; Innovation and Instruction Building is the home of the university&#x27;s College of Business Administration and Public Policy. The building includes a 250-seat auditorium, collaborative learning classrooms, distance learning spaces, event spaces, and faculty offices.

Within contemporary history, in the year 2022 Cal State Dominguez Hills had the distinction of having five of its graduates simultaneously serving as mayors of cities in LA County.

The San Diego State Aztecs football team used the stadium as their home venue for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. The Los Angeles Wildcats of the XFL also played at the stadium during their one season of existence.

Dignity Health Sports Park was the site of the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final. The United States men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national soccer teams often use the facility for training camps and some home matches. During the 2028 Summer Olympics, the venue will host rugby, modern pentathlon, tennis, and field hockey.

<text>Thomas Lowry Young (December 14, 1832July 20, 1888) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. Young, a Republican, served as the 33rd governor of Ohio from March 2, 1877, to January 14, 1878.

==Early life==
Young was born in Killyleagh, County Down, in Ulster, a northern province of Ireland. At that time, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. While living in Ireland, his father was a gardener for The 2nd Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. He immigrated with his parents to the United States as a child and spent his childhood in New York.

He worked for a Democratic Party newspaper in Sidney, Ohio in 1862 between military service, and afterward, and spoke out against the Lincoln Administration, believing them to be too soft in the war effort thus far. After military service, he returned to Cincinnati and graduated from the Cincinnati Law School in 1865.

==Military service==
Young enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1848, originally joining as a musician. He advanced through the ranks of the artillery to become a First Sergeant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, serving under Brevet Major John F. Reynolds. After his service ended in January 1858, Young moved to Pennsylvania, then to Cincinnati a year later, where he served as the Assistant Superintendent for the House of Refuge Reform School for Youth.

In March 1861 Young, believing a civil war to be imminent, wrote to General Winfield Scott volunteering his services. He officially joined the American Civil War effort a month later. Between August and December, he served under John C. Frémont as a captain while stationed in Missouri. The unit disbanded at the beginning of 1862, and Young left the service.

Young re-enlisted and received a commission as major in the 118th Ohio Infantry in September 1862, where he remained for the duration of his service. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in February 1863 and the rank of colonel in April 1864. At the Battle of Resaca in May, Young led a charge against the enemy that was quickly defeated; the charge caused him to lose 116 of his 270 men in the span of a few minutes. He contracted an illness during the Atlanta Campaign and resigned from the Army in September. President Abraham Lincoln brevetted him Brigadier-General of volunteers for his service on March 13, 1865.

==Career==
Shortly afterward, he began his political career with an appointment as Assistant City Auditor, a position he held for the rest of the year. He was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives afterward and served a single two-year term from 1866 to 1868. Young became Hamilton County Recorder in October 1867, and held the position until President Andrew Johnson named him Internal Revenue Supervisor of Southern Ohio in late 1868, a position he held through 1869.

After resigning from that position, Young worked in real estate until 1871 when he was elected to the Ohio State Senate. At that point he was considered highly regarded in the Republican Party, and when elected to the State Senate, he had more votes than most other Republicans on the statewide ballot.

Young was elected the 12th lieutenant governor of Ohio in 1875, defeating Samuel Cary, taking office in 1876. He then filled out the term of Rutherford B. Hayes when the latter was elected to the presidency, serving from 1877 to 1878.

Young was then elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1878 and served two terms before losing a battle for renomination in 1882.

== Personal life ==
He died in 1888 while holding a position on the Cincinnati Board of Public Affairs. Young was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.

CSUMB offers housing in many areas around campus. On the main campus there are eight residence halls each renovated Army barracks. Willet, Cypress, Manzanita, Asilomar, Yarrow, Avocet, Tortuga, and Sanderling Halls surround the main quad on campus. Pinnacles and Vineyard Suites as well as Strawberry Apartments make up North Quad on the north end of campus. In fall of 2015, the university opened three new residence halls, called Promontory, all of which offering apartment size dormitories.

===Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library===
The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library has of floor space. It is located at Divarty and Fifth streets, and diagonally across from the Chapman Science Center. A roundabout sits between the library and the science building. The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library is certified LEED Silver and has been cited for a range of sustainable design strategies from daylighting and low-energy use to healthy carpets, water conservation, and high-recycled content materials.

Aside from being the largest building on the CSUMB campus, it is the greenest in terms of energy usage. Up to 30% less electricity is needed, for example, because of floor-to-ceiling glass walls that let in natural light. Additionally, ventilation techniques operate through the floor instead of the ceiling, allowing cooler air to travel a lesser distance. The light let in from the atrium is indirect rather than direct sunlight.

===Other locations===
CSUMB has other locations within Monterey County, including CSUMB at Ryan Ranch (in Monterey), CSUMB at North Salinas, and CSUMB at Salinas City Center. The National Steinbeck Center is located at CSUMB at Salinas City Center.

CSUMB relies on Monterey–Salinas Transit for transportation among its various locations.

<text>Terrance Quinn (born July 15, 1952), known professionally as Terry O&#x27;Quinn, is an American actor. He is best known for his Primetime Emmy Award-winning performance of John Locke on the TV series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010). In film, he is also known for playing the title role in &quot;The Stepfather&quot; (1987) and Howard Hughes in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991) with roles in other films such as &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; (1985), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), &quot;Blind Fury&quot; (1989), &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993) and &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996).

Other prominent television roles include Peter Watts in &quot;Millennium&quot; (1996–1999), FBI Asst. Director Kendall in &quot;Alias&quot; (2002–2004), Commander Joe White in &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2011–2018) and Tom Tavner in &quot;Patriot&quot; (2015–2018).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Quinn was born at War Memorial Hospital in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, one of 11 siblings, and grew up in nearby Newberry, Michigan. He is of Irish descent, and was raised Catholic. He attended Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, and the University of Iowa in Iowa City. He changed his surname from Quinn to O&#x27;Quinn as another registered actor already had the name Terrance Quinn.

In the 1970s, he went to Baltimore to act in the Center Stage production of &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. He remained at Center Stage for some years and often appeared with the late Tana Hicken, most notably as Benedick to her Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. His first movie role was in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

==Career==
O&#x27;Quinn began acting in the 1970s during his time at Central Michigan University. He not only was an actor but also playwright/director. He wrote and directed the musical &quot;Orchestrina&quot;. This musical featured five main characters: The Man (played by Jeff Daniels), The Boy (Harold Downs), The Woman (Ann O&#x27;Donnell), The Girl (Debbie Penwarden), and The Drunk (James Hilliker), plus a female and a male chorus. He was roommates at CMU with actor Brad Slaight.

Starting in 1980, O&#x27;Quinn has appeared in various feature films such as &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Young Guns&quot;, &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;, alongside Rutger Hauer in &quot;Blind Fury&quot;, and as Howard Hughes in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;.

O&#x27;Quinn also appeared in the Canadian horror movie, &quot;Pin&quot; (1988) alongside British-born Canadian actor, David Hewlett.

His early television roles include guest appearances on &quot; Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (episode &quot;In the Bag&quot;), &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (episode &quot;Give a Little, Take a Little&quot;), &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (episode &quot;The Pegasus&quot;), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (1985 revival; episode &quot;Chameleon&quot;), &quot;&quot; (episode &quot;Hate Crimes&quot;), a recurring role on &quot;Earth 2&quot;, another recurring role as Captain (later Rear Admiral) Thomas Boone on &quot;JAG&quot;, as well as Colonel Will Ryan in episode 15 of season 1 on the &quot;JAG&quot; spin-off series &quot;NCIS&quot; (episode &quot;Enigma&quot;).

Around 1995, O&#x27;Quinn made guest appearances in &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Harsh Realm&quot;, produced by Chris Carter, who also cast him in the film &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot; and then once again in the final season. In 1996, O&#x27;Quinn started acting in the television series &quot;Millennium&quot; as Peter Watts, also produced by Chris Carter. O&#x27;Quinn held this role for all three seasons of the series. O&#x27;Quinn holds the distinction of having played four different characters within the extended &quot;X-Files&quot;/&quot;Millennium&quot; continuum (the two shows being classed together since both Lance Henriksen&#x27;s character of Frank Black and Charles Nelson Reilly&#x27;s character of Jose Chung have appeared in both shows).

===&quot;The Stepfather&quot; films===

O&#x27;Quinn made his breakthrough by starring as the title character in &quot;The Stepfather&quot;, a deranged serial killer going by the name &quot;Jerry Blake&quot; (his character&#x27;s real name and identity are never revealed), who is obsessed with having an ideal family. When a widowed mother and daughter don&#x27;t comply with his expectations, he spirals into a spell of madness and attempts to brutally murder them. O&#x27;Quinn was praised by critics, including Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who commented, &quot;&quot;The Stepfather&quot; has one wonderful element: Terry O&#x27;Quinn&#x27;s performance.&quot; Ebert wrote, &quot;He is a journeyman actor from TV and many movies, usually in supporting roles and you may or may not recognize him. What&#x27;s clear at once is that he is a strong actor and given this leading role he brings all kinds of creepy dimensions to it. He has the thankless assignment of showing us a completely hateful, repellent character – and he approaches the task as an exercise in cloying middle-class good manners.&quot; O&#x27;Quinn was nominated for both a Saturn Award and an Independent Spirit Award for his performance. A sequel, &quot;Stepfather II&quot;, was released two years later, in which his character escapes from an insane asylum. It grossed almost a million dollars less at the box office. Not impressed with the second movie, O&#x27;Quinn declined to appear in its third installment, in which the stepfather character was portrayed by Robert Wightman.

O&#x27;Quinn was approached by the director of the 2009 reboot of &quot;The Stepfather&quot;, Nelson McCormick, to make a cameo appearance in the film but according to the producers O&#x27;Quinn turned down the offer.

===&quot;Lost&quot;===
After a string of recurring appearances on &quot;Alias&quot; (2002–2003), as the FBI Director Kendall, O&#x27;Quinn became a favorite of television producer J. J. Abrams. Following a seven-episode guest run on &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2003–2004, O&#x27;Quinn received a call from Abrams indicating that the producer wanted to cast him in his new television drama &quot;Lost&quot; without any audition. In 2005, O&#x27;Quinn received an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama for his work as John Locke on the series &quot;Lost&quot;. O&#x27;Quinn admitted on the TV Guide Channel that he did not have much faith in &quot;Lost&quot; at first, calling it &quot;The Mysterious Gilligan&#x27;s Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;. The show, however, became one of the most popular on television, and on September 16, 2007, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his role, and was nominated again for an Emmy for the role in 2010, which he did not win. In a &quot;TV.com&quot; interview O&#x27;Quinn commented that the reason he felt comfortable playing this character is because he&#x27;s a bit like him.

=== 2010–present ===
O&#x27;Quinn has made a number of television appearances since &quot;Lost&quot;. From 2012 to 2013, O&#x27;Quinn starred in the short-lived series &quot;666 Park Avenue&quot; as Gavin Doran. In 2012, he appeared in the second season of &quot;Falling Skies&quot;. Additionally, O’Quinn starred for two seasons in Amazon Studios&#x27; &quot;Patriot&quot;.

In 2016, it was announced that O&#x27;Quinn would be joining the second season of &quot;Secret and Lies&quot;. In 2019, O&#x27;Quinn starred in the only season of &quot;Perpetual Grace, LTD&quot; on Epix.

In February 2021, it was announced that O&#x27;Quinn was cast as Martin Queller in the Netflix thriller series &quot;Pieces of Her&quot;, which is adapted from the Karin Slaughter novel of the same name.

In October 2023, during New York Comic Con, he was announced, to play the antagonist Major General Beale in &quot;The Walking Dead The Ones Who Live&quot;, created by Scott M. Gimple.

Terry joined the Cameo platform shortly after its launch in 2017. He has since been creating videos for fans and donating all of the proceeds to the Virginia Beach SPCA. Terry has raised thousands of dollars on Cameo, and continues to create videos weekly.

<text>California State University, Stanislaus (Stanislaus State, Stan State) is a public university in Turlock, California, United States. It is part of the California State University system. It was established in 1957 and offers 45 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and 38 graduate programs, which include 22 master&#x27;s degree programs, one doctoral degree (Doctor of Education), 10 certificate programs, and 5 teaching credentials. Stanislaus State is a Hispanic-serving institution.

==History==
In 1957, the California State Legislature established what was then called Stanislaus State College as the 15th campus of the CSU system. Because Turlock was better known at the time for its turkeys than its aspirations towards higher education, Clark Kerr highlighted this event in his memoirs as an example of how the state colleges had become vulnerable to pork barrel politics in the state legislature. This was one of several reasons behind the creation of the California Master Plan for Higher Education of 1960.

Classes began on the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds in September, 1960, and the college moved to its current location five years later. The college was first accredited in 1964. It gained university status and its current name in 1986.

In 1974, the university established an extension program at the campus of San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton in neighboring San Joaquin County. In 1998 the Stanislaus State-Stockton Center expanded and moved to its own permanent campus in downtown Stockton.

Sarah Palin&#x27;s selection as the keynote speaker at Stanislaus State&#x27;s main fundraising event in 2010. Sponsored by a school foundation, the event resulted in the most successful fundraiser in the campus&#x27;s history. It provoked speculation and debate when the university refused to disclose her speaking fee. A resulting investigation by the Attorney General of California Jerry Brown found no violation of law, but recommended accounting and oversight improvements in the foundation&#x27;s practices.

==Academics==
Fall freshman statistics

California State University, Stanislaus offers 45 undergraduate programs, 17 master&#x27;s degree programs and 2 graduate certificate programs, 6 school credential programs and a doctoral degree program in Educational Leadership. Its academic disciplines are clustered within four colleges:

In fall 2012, Stanislaus State launched an online Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree program, the first fully online AACSB-accredited MBA program offered in the state of California.
The university library building was originally named for founding president Dr. J. Burton Vasché. The library currently holds over 370,000 volumes, 841 print journal subscriptions, access to 141 electronic databases, and a growing number of electronic journals, video recordings, and compact discs. The University Library also contains a Children&#x27;s collection, which has more than 5,900 titles of children&#x27;s literature. The library offers access to more than 70 electronic databases and also contains federal, state, and local documents.

As of fall 2017, the five most popular bachelor&#x27;s degrees Programs are BS Business Administration, BA Psychology, BA Liberal Studies, BA/BS Biological Sciences, and BA Criminal Justice.

The university has several resources available for students. The Tutoring/Writing Center is located in the Vasche Library and offers individual and group tutoring. Some of the services available include essay planning, organization, development and revision, writing across the curriculum, ESL, and WPST test preparation. The university also has a bookstore that features marble herms by sculptor Andrew Wilson alongside other artwork, as well as a university police department and financial aid office.

<text>In physics, a one-loop Feynman diagram is a connected Feynman diagram with only one cycle (unicyclic). Such a diagram can be obtained from a connected tree diagram by taking two external lines of the same type and joining them together into an edge.

Diagrams with loops (in graph theory, these kinds of loops are called cycles, while the word loop is an edge connecting a vertex with itself) correspond to the quantum corrections to the classical field theory. Because one-loop diagrams only contain one cycle, they express the next-to-classical contributions called the &quot;semiclassical contributions&quot;.

One-loop diagrams are usually computed as the integral over one independent momentum that can &quot;run in the cycle&quot;. The Casimir effect, Hawking radiation and Lamb shift are examples of phenomena whose existence can be implied using one-loop Feynman diagrams, especially the well-known &quot;triangle diagram&quot;:

The evaluation of one-loop Feynman diagrams usually leads to divergent expressions, which are either due to:

* zero-mass particles in the cycle of the diagram (infrared divergence) or 
* insufficient falloff of the integrand for high momenta (ultraviolet divergence).

Infrared divergences are usually dealt with by assigning the zero mass particles a small mass &quot;λ&quot;, evaluating the corresponding expression and then taking the limit formula_1. Ultraviolet divergences are dealt with by renormalization.

<doc id="700132" wikidata="Q332708" url="?curid=700132" title="Overloading (chess)">
<text>Overloading (also overworking) is a chess tactic in which a defensive piece is given an additional defensive assignment which it cannot complete without abandoning its original defensive assignment.
==Examples==

Krasenkow–Karpov, in the first round of the 2003 Corus chess tournament, reached the diagrammed position with Black to play. As the white rook on f1 is preventing the black queen from giving checkmate by capturing the pawn on f3, Black won immediately with 
:29... Re1

further pinning the white rook against the king and overloading the rook. White now cannot prevent the black queen from taking the f-pawn: if White tries to protect the rook with 30.Rxe1 or 30.Qc4, then 30...Qxf3. If White sacrifices the rook by playing 30.Kg2, then 30...Rxf1 31.Kxf1 Qxf3+ and loses the other rook with 32...Qxd5.

In Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu–Anish Giri (see diagram), Giri (Black) played 
:30... Bxh3 

overloading the g2-pawn, as 31.gxh3 is met with 31...f3 32.Re3 Qg5+. After 31.Qc3 Bg4, Nisipeanu resigned.
An overload was also used in Rotlewi versus Rubinstein.

<text>Maria Minna (born March 14, 1948) is a former Canadian politician who represented the Toronto riding of Beaches—East York in the House of Commons as a member of the Liberal Party from 1993 to 2011.

==Background==
Minna was born in Pofi, Italy, and moved to Canada with her family at the age of 9. They settled in Toronto, Ontario, in the Christie Pits area. Her father worked in the construction industry and her mother laboured as a factory worker. She is the third eldest of five children, having three sisters and a brother. She attended a vocational high school earning a diploma and started working as a secretary. At age 24 she attended the University of Toronto where she graduated with an Honours B.A. in Sociology. At age 34, she married Robert MacBain, a public relations consultant.

From 1981 to 1992, she served as the volunteer president of COSTI-IIAS (formerly Centro Organizzativo Scuole Tecniche Italiane and the IIAS Italian Immigrant Aid Society), Canada&#x27;s largest immigrant services organization. She also served as president of the National Congress of Italian-Canadians.

Due in part to her high profile, Minna was appointed to serve on two task forces with the Workers Compensation Board. In 1986 she co-chaired the Task Force on Vocational Rehabilitation and in 1991 she chaired a Task Force on Service Delivery. Both led to significant improvements in the operation of the WCB.

==Politics==
Minna sought the Liberal nomination for the riding of York West in 1984. She lost to Sergio Marchi. She also tried to get nominated in the riding of York North in 1988 but lost to Maurizio Bevilacqua. The York North nomination fight turned ugly amidst claims of delegate stacking and improper procedures. Minna later appealed the nomination but withdrew the complaint claiming that the appeal process was tainted.

===In government===
She was elected to parliament in the 1993 election in which the Liberal party won all but one of the 99 Ontario seats. Although the former Liberal candidate ran against her as an independent, she defeated New Democratic Party (NDP) incumbent Neil Young by a margin of two-to-one, thus becoming the first Liberal in history to represent the Beaches area south of the Danforth. As of 2008 she has been re-elected five times easily defeating high-profile candidates such as Peter Tabuns (2004 election, by 7,738 votes) and Marilyn Churley (2006 election, by 2,778 votes; 2008 election, by 4,092 votes).

On August 3, 1999, Minna was appointed to Cabinet as the Minister of International Cooperation. She held the post until the beginning of 2002. On December 11, 2001, Minna was accused of improperly voting in a municipal by-election. She voted for friend and colleague Gail Nyberg who was running to replace Michael Prue who had been elected to the Provincial government in a September by-election. On advice from municipal officials, Minna cast a ballot even though she didn&#x27;t live within the ward which occupies the northern half of her riding. According to municipal election rules, anyone who owns or rents a business is allowed to vote. Minna&#x27;s constituency office was in the ward so that allowed her to cast a ballot. Soon after, Minna was dropped from Cabinet during a ministerial shuffle.

Minna was bitter about the demotion and complained to the Liberal Party&#x27;s women&#x27;s caucus that she was told to keep quiet about the issue. She claimed she was &quot;hung out to dry by ambitious individuals...&quot; Later she conceded that the PMO&#x27;s office had told her that it would be better to wait for the results of the ethics investigation. Initially the ethics counsellor terminated the allegations probe since she was dropped from Cabinet but Minna insisted that it be reopened. She said, &quot;It&#x27;s my personal credibility that&#x27;s at stake. It&#x27;s not the cabinet post.&quot; Fellow Liberal MP Sheila Copps who sympathized with Minna&#x27;s situation was quoted as saying, &quot;The one thing you have in politics is your reputation.&quot; The probe was reopened and she was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.

During her time in government, Minna has held several leadership roles that have focused on immigration and international relations. In 1994 she was appointed Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration from 1996 to 1998. In October 2004, Minna was appointed special adviser to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on issues of women, peace and security. In March 2005, Minna led a five-person Parliamentary delegation to assist with the peace process in Sri Lanka.

===In opposition===
From 2006 to January 2009, Minna was the Official Opposition Critic for the Status of Women. Minna was the Official Opposition Critic for Labour. On May 2, 2011, during the 41st federal election, Minna lost her seat to NDP candidate Matthew Kellway.

==Awards==
Minna has received several awards recognizing her involvement with the immigrant community. These include the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce President&#x27;s Award (2001), the Permio Italia nel Mondo award for individuals of Italian origin (2001), Results Canada&#x27;s Outstanding Leadership Award (2002), and the Canada-Sri Lanka Business Council&#x27;s President&#x27;s Award (2006).

<text>Devon Island (, ) is an island in Canada and the largest uninhabited island (no permanent residents) in the world. It is located in Baffin Bay, Qikiqtaaluk Region, Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the largest members of the Arctic Archipelago, the second-largest of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canada&#x27;s sixth-largest island, and the 27th-largest island in the world. It has an area of (slightly smaller than Croatia). The bedrock is Precambrian gneiss and Paleozoic siltstones and shales. The highest point is the Devon Ice Cap at which is part of the Arctic Cordillera. Devon Island contains several small mountain ranges, such as the Treuter Mountains, Haddington Range and the Cunningham Mountains. The notable similarity of its surface to that of Mars has attracted interest from scientists.

==History and settlement==

Robert Bylot and William Baffin were the first Europeans to sight Devon Island in 1616. William Edward Parry charted its south coast in 1819–20, and named it North Devon, after Devon in England, a name which was changed to Devon Island by the end of the 1800s.
In 1850, Edwin De Haven sailed up Wellington Channel and sighted the Grinnell Peninsula.

An outpost was established at Dundas Harbour in 1924, and it was leased to Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company nine years later. The collapse of fur prices led to the dispersal of 52 Baffin Island Inuit families on the island in 1934. It was considered a disaster due to wind conditions and the much colder climate, and the Inuit chose to leave in 1936. Dundas Harbour was populated again in the late 1940s, but it was closed again in 1951. Only the ruins of a few buildings remain today.

==Geography==
Devon Island is located between Ellesmere Island in the north, Cornwallis Island in the west, and Baffin Island in the south, separated by Lancaster Sound.

Because of its relatively high elevation and its extreme northern latitude, Devon Island supports only a meagre population of muskox and small birds and mammals; the island does support hypolith communities. Animal life is concentrated in the Truelove Lowland area of the island, which has a favourable microclimate and supports relatively lush Arctic vegetation. Temperatures during the brief (40 to 55 days) growing season seldom exceed , and in winter can plunge to as low as . With a polar desert ecology, Devon Island receives very little precipitation.

Cape Liddon is an Important Bird Area (IBA) notable for its black guillemot and northern fulmar populations. Cape Vera, another IBA site, is also noted for its northern fulmar population.

Devon Island is also notable for the presence of the Haughton impact crater, created some 39 million years ago when a meteorite about in diameter crashed into what were then forests. The impact left a crater about in diameter, which was a lake for several million years.

==Scientific research==
===Devon Island Research Station===
The Devon Island Research Station was established in 1960 and it is maintained by the Arctic Institute of North America. It is located in Truelove Lowland, on the northeast coast of Devon Island ().

===Flashline Mars===
The Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station project entered its third season in 2004. In July 2004, Devon Island became the temporary home for five scientists and two journalists, who were to use the Mars-like environment to simulate living and working on that planet. April 2007 through 21 August 2007 was the longest simulation period and included 20 scientific studies.

The Haughton crater is now considered one of the world&#x27;s best Mars analog sites. It is the summer home to NASA&#x27;s complementary scientific program, the Haughton–Mars Project. The Island&#x27;s freezing temperatures, isolation, and remoteness offer scientists matchless research opportunities. Devon Island’s harsh climate and barren terrain endeared it to NASA as the Arctic day and night cycle and restricted communications capabilities offer challenges similar to those presented by long-duration space flights.

HMP has conducted geological, hydrological, botanical, and microbiological studies in this harsh environment since 1997. HMP-2008 was the twelfth field season at Devon Island.

In 2007, fossils of the seal ancestor &quot;Puijila darwini&quot; were found on the island.

On July 16, 2013, the Canadian Space Agency assigned Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen to a secondment with the Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration of the University of Western Ontario at Haughton Crater in preparation for a potential future crewed exploration of Mars, the Moon or the asteroids.

<doc id="700141" wikidata="Q17080006" url="?curid=700141" title="Semiclassical physics">
<text>In physics, semiclassical refers to a theory in which one part of a system is described quantum mechanically, whereas the other is treated classically. For example, external fields will be constant, or when changing will be classically described. In general, it incorporates a development in powers of the Planck constant, resulting in the classical physics of power 0, and the first nontrivial approximation to the power of (−1). In this case, there is a clear link between the quantum-mechanical system and the associated semi-classical and classical approximations, as it is similar in appearance to the transition from physical optics to geometric optics.

== History ==
Max Planck was the first to introduce the idea of quanta of energy in 1900 while studying black-body radiation. In 1906, he was also the first to write that quantum theory should replicate classical mechanics at some limit, particularly if the Planck constant &quot;h&quot; were infinitesimal. With this idea he showed that Planck&#x27;s law for thermal radiation leads to the Rayleigh–Jeans law, the classical prediction (valid for large wavelength).

== Instances ==

Some examples of a semiclassical approximation include:
* WKB approximation: electrons in classical external electromagnetic fields.
* semiclassical gravity: quantum field theory within a classical curved gravitational background (see general relativity).
* quantum chaos; quantization of classical chaotic systems.
* magnetic properties of materials and astrophysical bodies under the effect of large magnetic fields (see for example De Haas–Van Alphen effect)
* quantum field theory, only Feynman diagrams with at most a single closed loop (see for example one-loop Feynman diagram) are considered, which corresponds to the powers of the Planck constant.

<text>PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk or Bank Mandiri, headquartered in Jakarta, is the largest bank in Indonesia in terms of assets, loans and deposits. Total assets as of 2022, were 1.992 Trillion rupiah (around US$133 Billion). As of 2022, Bank Mandiri is the largest bank in Indonesia by total assets.

As of December 2022, the bank had 2,364 branches spread across three different time zones in Indonesia and 7 branches abroad, about 13,027 automatic teller machines (ATMs), and 11 subsidiaries, such as: Mandiri Sekuritas, Mandiri Tunas Finance, AXA Mandiri Financial Services, Bank Mandiri Taspen, and Mandiri AXA General Insurance.

==History==
===Pre-merger===

Bank Mandiri is the result of the merger made by Indonesian government from four older government-owned banks that failed in 1998. Those four banks were Bank Bumi Daya, Bank Dagang Negara, Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia, and Bank Pembangunan Indonesia. During the amalgamation and reorganisation, the government reduced the number of branches by 194 and the number of personnel from 26,600 to 17,620.

Bank Bumi Daya and Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia was previously merged in 1965 by the Indonesian government under Guided Democracy into Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) umbrella, 1968: The Indonesian government then reorganized the banks in 1968 as the New Order government took place.

* Bank Bumi Daya (BBD) started in 1959, when the government nationalized Nationale Handelsbank&#x27;s operations in Indonesia as a part of boycott on Dutch companies amid both nation&#x27;s dispute over Western New Guinea, and from them the government created Bank Umum Negara (&quot;State General Bank&quot;). In 1964, during Konfrontasi, the government nationalized Chartered Bank&#x27;s operations in Indonesia and merged them into Bank Umum Negara; the British overseas bank had first entered Indonesia in 1863 when it opened an agency in Batavia (now Jakarta). In 1965 the government brought Bank Umum Negara into BNI, renaming it Bank Negara Indonesia Unit IV (BNI IV), but in 1968 BNI IV became an independent bank again with the name Bank Bumi Daya.
* Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia (BankExim, &quot;Export Import Bank of Indonesia&quot;) was created in 1960 as the Indonesian government nationalized the Indonesian operations of Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij. The bank then merged into BNI by the government in 1965 and became Bank Negara Indonesia Unit II (BNI II). In 1968, the government split BNI II into two parts, with the BNI Unit II Export-Import Division becoming BankExim, which specialised in trade finance.
* Bank Dagang Negara (BDN, &quot;State Trading Bank&quot;) was established in 1960 from the nationalization of Escomptobank. Escomptobank NV, previously Nederlandsch Indische Escompto Maatschappij until 1949, was established in Batavia in 1857.
* Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo, &quot;Development Bank of Indonesia&quot;) had its root from Bank Industri Negara (BIN, &quot;State Industrial Bank&quot;), which was established in 1951. The bank was aimed to finance priority sectors, such as plantations, industry and mining. In 1960, the Indonesian government established Bapindo and merged BIN into it. Bapindo specialised in medium and long-term financing of manufacturing, tourism and transportation. In 1986, Bapindo expanded into general commercial banking.

===Merger and later history===
In 1998, the government merged BBD, BDN, BankExim and Bapindo to create Bank Mandiri to restructurize some state-owned banks to manage impacts of financial crisis at the time. Bank Mandiri was established on 2 October 1998, and the merged banks operated effectively as a single bank starting on 31 July 1999. The name &quot;Mandiri&quot; (Indonesian for &quot;self-reliant&quot; or &quot;independent&quot;) was coined by President B. J. Habibie during his presidency, with the hope that the bank could become a self-reliant bank and encourage the people, especially who need microfinancing, to also become self-reliant.

In 2004, the bank opened a branch in Dili, East Timor and a representative office in Shanghai, China.

<text>Edward Follansbee Noyes (October 3, 1832September 4, 1890) was a Republican politician from Ohio. Noyes served as the 30th governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Noyes was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He was orphaned at the age of three and was raised in New Hampshire by his grandfather and a guardian. At the age of thirteen, he was apprenticed to the printer of &quot;The Morning Star&quot;, a religious newspaper published in Dover, New Hampshire. He remained an apprentice for over four years until he left to enter an academy in Kingston, New Hampshire. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1857 (4th in a class of 57 students), then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended the Cincinnati Law School.

Noyes served in the Union Army during the Civil War. He helped organize the 39th Ohio Infantry, and was rewarded with a commission as its first major on July 27, 1861. Within a few months, he had become the regiment&#x27;s colonel.

Noyes married Margaret W. Proctor at Kingston, New Hampshire in February, 1863, while on leave from the army.
He was severely wounded in his ankle in a skirmish at Ruff&#x27;s Mill on July 4, 1864, during the Atlanta Campaign and, as a result, had his left leg amputated. Three months later, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker assigned Noyes, who was still recuperating and using crutches, to the command of Camp Dennison near Cincinnati, breveted him as a brigadier general. Noyes commanded the post until April 22, 1865, when he resigned to become city solicitor.

He was elected in October 1866 as the probate judge of Hamilton County.

He was elected to the governorship in 1871, besting another former Union Army officer, Col. George W. McCook, by more than twenty thousand votes. He served one two-year term between 1872–74, pushing for stricter coal mine inspection laws and promoting fish conservation. He lost re-election in 1873 by 817 votes, 50.1% - 49.9%.

In 1874, he was appointed an Ohio Commissioner of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia

He later served as Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s Minister to France from 1877 to 1881, a patronage reward for his strong support of his fellow Buckeye soldier during Hayes&#x27; presidential campaign.

He died on September 4, 1890, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<text>The West Humboldt Range is a short mountain range in the western Great Basin in northwestern Nevada in the United States.

==Geography==
The mountain range runs for approximately southwest to northeast in northern Churchill County and southern Pershing County. The southwest end of the range is approximately ENE of Reno.

The range separates the lower course and terminus-(Humboldt Lake) of the Humboldt River and the Humboldt Sink on the northwest side from the expansive Carson Sink on the south and southeast side. Interstate 80 follows the course of the Humboldt along the northwest side of the range. During the last ice age, the range stood along the shore of Lake Lahontan, the prehistoric shorelines and beaches of which are visible along the sides of the range.

Few peaks in the range are named; one of the few with an official name is Topog Peak in northern Churchill County, near the southwestern end of the range.

==History==
In 1905 the Saurian Expedition, led by John C. Merriam and financed by Annie Alexander, explored the Triassic limestones of the range, discovering 25 specimens of Ichthyosaur.

<doc id="700148" wikidata="Q734043" url="?curid=700148" title="Richard Conte">
<text>Nicholas Peter Conte (March 24, 1910 – April 15, 1975), known professionally as Richard Conte, was an American actor. He was known for his starring roles in films noir and crime dramas during the 1940s and 1950s, including &quot;Call Northside 777&quot;, &quot;Cry of the City&quot;, &quot;House of Strangers&quot;, &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot;, and &quot;The Big Combo&quot;.

He also co-starred in three films opposite Frank Sinatra: the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, &quot;Tony Rome&quot;, and &quot;Lady in Cement&quot;. Later in his career, he achieved recognition for his portrayal of Emilio Barzini, the mob boss rival to Vito Corleone and the principal antagonist of &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972).

==Early life and education==
Richard Conte was born Nicholas Peter Conte on March 24, 1910 in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of Italian-Americans Julia (nee Fina), a seamstress, and Pasquale Conte, a barber. He graduated from William L. Dickinson High School in Jersey City.

Conte worked as a truck driver, messenger, shoe salesman, and singing waiter before starting his acting career. He was discovered by film director Elia Kazan and actor John Garfield during his job at a Connecticut resort, which led to Conte finding stage work. He eventually earned a scholarship to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where he became a standout actor.

==Career==
===Stage===
He made his film debut under the name Nicholas Conte in &quot;Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence&quot; (1939) at 20th Century Fox. He played Tony, a hobo who meets up with Joe (Glenn Ford who was also making his film debut) and Anita (Jean Rogers). The three of them make their way west hopping trains. They are later joined by Professor B (Raymond Walburn).

He made his Broadway debut in &quot;My Heart&#x27;s in the Highlands&quot; (1939) for the Group Theatre. Also for the Group, he was in Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;Night Music&quot; (1940). He performed in the road company of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;.

On Broadway, he was in &quot;Heavenly Express&quot; (1941) and &quot;Walk Into My Parlor&quot; (1941). He was a hit in &quot;Jason&quot; (1942) then was &quot;he Family&quot; (1943).

During World War II, Conte served in the United States Army, but he was discharged because of eye trouble.

===20th Century Fox===
In May 1943, Conte signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox, changing his name to Richard Conte. His first Fox film was &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot; (1943), where he was billed fourth.

He followed it with another war drama, &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944), directed by Lewis Milestone; he was billed second, beneath Dana Andrews.

Conte had a smaller part in &quot;Captain Eddie&quot; (1945), a biopic about Eddie Rickenbacker, and played an Italian POW in &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; (1945).

Conte had the star role in &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945), another war film for Milestone, and he was teamed again with Andrews.

===Success===
Fox promoted Conte to top billing with the film noir &quot;The Spider&quot; (1945). Although a B film for the studio, it was successful enough to establish Conte in film noir.

He had supporting roles in &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; (1946), directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, and the spy film &quot;13 Rue Madeleine&quot; (1946), directed by Henry Hathaway.

Conte was borrowed by Enterprise Productions for &quot;The Other Love&quot; (1947) with Barbara Stanwyck and David Niven. Back at Fox, he was in Hathaway&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Call Northside 777&quot; (1948) as the prisoner whose innocence is proved by James Stewart.

Conte was teamed with Victor Mature in &quot;Cry of the City&quot; (1948). MGM borrowed him for &quot;Big Jack&quot; (1949), then he did &quot;House of Strangers&quot; (1949) with Edward G. Robinson, playing Max Monetti, a lawyer who defends his father (Robinson) against government charges of banking irregularities and goes to prison for jury tampering.

Conte was top billed in &quot;Thieves&#x27; Highway&quot; (1949), directed by Jules Dassin, and co-starred with Gene Tierney in Otto Preminger&#x27;s film noir &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1950).

===Universal===
Conte signed a contract with Universal Pictures, and he starred in some crime films: &quot;The Sleeping City&quot; (1950); &quot;Hollywood Story&quot; (1951), directed by William Castle; and &quot;The Raging Tide&quot; (1951).

After doing &quot;The Fighter&quot; (1952) for United Artists, he returned to Universal for &quot;The Raiders&quot; (1952).

Conte went to Warner Bros to co-star with Anne Baxter and Ann Sothern in &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953) directed by Fritz Lang. Back at Universal, Conte was in &quot;Desert Legion&quot; (1953). He made &quot;Slaves of Babylon&quot; (1953) for Sam Katzman at Columbia. Conte started guest starring on TV shows such as &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot;, &quot;Ford Television Theatre&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;.

===Bill Broidy===
In 1953, Conte signed a contract with Bill Broidy to make six films over three years, and he would be paid 25% of the profits. The first was the crime drama &quot;Highway Dragnet&quot; (1954), based on a story by Roger Corman, and he then went to England to make &quot;Mask of Dust&quot; (1954) for Hammer Films director Terence Fisher. He was going to direct &quot;The Wolf Pack&quot; for Broidy, but it was not made.

Back in the U.S., Conte did &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955) for Cornel Wilde&#x27;s company; &quot;New York Confidential&quot; (1955) for producer Edward Small; and &quot;The Big Tip Off&quot; (1955) for Broidy.

Conte went to England for &quot;Little Red Monkey&quot; (1955), RKO for &quot;Bengazi&quot; (1955), and Warners for a Korean War movie &quot;Target Zero&quot; (1955).

Conte broke out of B movies with the second lead in &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; (1955), an MGM biopic about Lillian Roth starring Susan Hayward. Conte and director Daniel Mann announced they would make &quot;Play by Play&quot;, but it was not made.

Conte made a series of films for Columbia. He co-starred with Judy Holliday in &quot;Full of Life&quot; (1956), played the lead in &quot;The Brothers Rico&quot; (1957), and had supporting roles in &quot;This Angry Age&quot; (1957) and &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959).

===Television===
He continued to guest on TV shows like &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;) and played the lead in a TV adaptation of &quot;The Gambler, the Nun and the Radio&quot; (1960). He had his first regular TV role in &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1959–1960).

Conte supported Frank Sinatra in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960) but then focused on TV: &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;Frontier Circus&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; and &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;.

He had a supporting role in &quot;Who&#x27;s Been Sleeping in My Bed?&quot; (1963), &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) (playing Barabbas) and the lead in &quot;The Eyes of Annie Jones&quot; (1964) for Robert L. Lippert. After &quot;Synanon&quot; (1965), he had the lead in &quot;Stay Tuned for Terror&quot; (1965), shot in Argentina.

Conte had a supporting role in &quot;Assault on a Queen&quot; (1966), and he was one of several stars in &quot;Hotel&quot; (1967). In 1966, Conte landed a supporting role in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot;.

He appeared as Lieutenant Dave Santini in two crime films with Frank Sinatra: &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967) and &quot;Lady in Cement&quot; (1968). He also did &quot;Sentenza di morte&quot; (1968).

In 1968, he released his only film as a director, &quot;Operation Cross Eagles&quot;, in which he also starred.

Conte&#x27;s later performances include &quot;The Bold Ones: The Lawyers&quot;, &quot;The Challengers&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1970).

=== &quot;The Godfather&quot; and later career ===

Conte had one of his memorable performances in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) as Don Emilio Barzini. He was at one time also considered for the title role, Don Vito Corleone, a role performed by Marlon Brando.

The success of the film led to Conte being cast in a series of &quot;mob&quot; roles, mainly in Italian-produced &quot;poliziotteschi&quot; films. These included &quot;Anna, quel particolare piacere&quot; (1972), &quot;The Violent Professionals&quot; (1973), &quot;Il Boss&quot; (1973), &quot;My Brother Anastasia&quot; (1973) with Alberto Sordi, &quot;Tony Arzenta&quot; (1973) with Alain Delon, &quot;Shoot First, Die Later&quot; (1974) and &quot;Violent Rome&quot; (1975). He did the horror films &quot;Evil Eye&quot; (1975), &quot;A Diary of a Murderess&quot; (1975) and &quot;Naked Exorcism&quot; (1975).

==Personal life and family==
Conte was a Republican who campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential election. Nonetheless, he was staunchly opposed to the Hollywood Blacklist, and was a member of the Committee for the First Amendment. He was Roman Catholic.

Conte was married to actress Ruth Storey, with whom he adopted a son, film editor Mark Conte. In 1950, Conte and Storey were living at 1366 San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills. They divorced in 1963. He married his second wife, Shirlee Colleen Garner (1935-2014), in 1973. His grandson is National Football League free safety Chris Conte. Chris is the son of Mark Conte.

==Death==
On April 3, 1975, Conte suffered a massive heart attack and a stroke. He was taken to UCLA Medical Center where the staff worked for eight hours to keep him alive. He was put in intensive care and died on April 15. He is buried in Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

<text>In mathematical physics, the WKB approximation or WKB method is a method for finding approximate solutions to linear differential equations with spatially varying coefficients. It is typically used for a semiclassical calculation in quantum mechanics in which the wavefunction is recast as an exponential function, semiclassically expanded, and then either the amplitude or the phase is taken to be changing slowly.

The name is an initialism for Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin. It is also known as the LG or Liouville–Green method. Other often-used letter combinations include JWKB and WKBJ, where the &quot;J&quot; stands for Jeffreys.

== Brief history ==
This method is named after physicists Gregor Wentzel, Hendrik Anthony Kramers, and Léon Brillouin, who all developed it in 1926. In 1923, mathematician Harold Jeffreys had developed a general method of approximating solutions to linear, second-order differential equations, a class that includes the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation itself was not developed until two years later, and Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were apparently unaware of this earlier work, so Jeffreys is often neglected credit. Early texts in quantum mechanics contain any number of combinations of their initials, including WBK, BWK, WKBJ, JWKB and BWKJ. An authoritative discussion and critical survey has been given by Robert B. Dingle.

Earlier appearances of essentially equivalent methods are: Francesco Carlini in 1817, Joseph Liouville in 1837, George Green in 1837, Lord Rayleigh in 1912 and Richard Gans in 1915. Liouville and Green may be said to have founded the method in 1837, and it is also commonly referred to as the Liouville–Green or LG method.

The important contribution of Jeffreys, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin to the method was the inclusion of the treatment of turning points, connecting the evanescent and oscillatory solutions at either side of the turning point. For example, this may occur in the Schrödinger equation, due to a potential energy hill.

==Formulation==

Generally, WKB theory is a method for approximating the solution of a differential equation whose &quot;highest derivative is multiplied by a small parameter&quot; . The method of approximation is as follows.

For a differential equation
formula_1
assume a solution of the form of an asymptotic series expansion
formula_2
in the limit . The asymptotic scaling of in terms of will be determined by the equation – see the example below.

Substituting the above ansatz into the differential equation and cancelling out the exponential terms allows one to solve for an arbitrary number of terms in the expansion.

WKB theory is a special case of multiple scale analysis.

==An example==
This example comes from the text of Carl M. Bender and Steven Orszag. Consider the second-order homogeneous linear differential equation
formula_3
where formula_4. Substituting
formula_5
results in the equation
formula_6

To leading order in &quot;ϵ&quot; (assuming, for the moment, the series will be asymptotically consistent), the above can be approximated as
formula_7

In the limit , the dominant balance is given by
formula_8

So is proportional to &quot;ϵ&quot;. Setting them equal and comparing powers yields
formula_9
which can be recognized as the eikonal equation, with solution
formula_10

Considering first-order powers of fixes
formula_11
This has the solution
formula_12
where is an arbitrary constant.

We now have a pair of approximations to the system (a pair, because can take two signs); the first-order WKB-approximation will be a linear combination of the two:
formula_13

Higher-order terms can be obtained by looking at equations for higher powers of . Explicitly,
formula_14
for .

=== Precision of the asymptotic series ===
The asymptotic series for is usually a divergent series, whose general term starts to increase after a certain value . Therefore, the smallest error achieved by the WKB method is at best of the order of the last included term.

For the equation
formula_3
with an analytic function, the value formula_16 and the magnitude of the last term can be estimated as follows:
formula_17
formula_18
where formula_19 is the point at which formula_20 needs to be evaluated and formula_21 is the (complex) turning point where formula_22, closest to formula_23.

The number can be interpreted as the number of oscillations between formula_19 and the closest turning point.

If formula_25 is a slowly changing function,
formula_26
the number will be large, and the minimum error of the asymptotic series will be exponentially small.

== Application in non relativistic quantum mechanics ==
The above example may be applied specifically to the one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger equation,
formula_27
which can be rewritten as
formula_28

===Approximation away from the turning points===
The wavefunction can be rewritten as the exponential of another function (closely related to the action), which could be complex,
formula_29
so that its substitution in Schrödinger&#x27;s equation gives:

formula_30

Next, the semiclassical approximation is used. This means that each function is expanded as a power series in .
formula_31
Substituting in the equation, and only retaining terms up to first order in , we get:
formula_32
which gives the following two relations:
formula_33
which can be solved for 1D systems, first equation resulting in:formula_34and the second equation computed for the possible values of the above, is generally expressed as:formula_35

where the wavefunction in the classically forbidden region is the WKB approximation but neglecting the growing exponential. This is a fair assumption for wide potential barriers through which the wavefunction is not expected to grow to high magnitudes. 
By the requirement of continuity of wavefunction and its derivatives, the following relation can be shown:formula_36

where formula_37 and formula_38.
Using formula_39 we express the values without signs as:

formula_40

formula_41

formula_42
Thus, the transmission coefficient is found to be:

formula_43

where formula_44, formula_37 and formula_38. The result can be stated as formula_47 where formula_48.

<text>A remaster is a change in the sound or image quality of previously created forms of media, whether audiophonic, cinematic, or videographic. The resulting product is said to be remastered. The terms digital remastering and digitally remastered are also used.

In a wider sense, remastering a product may involve other, typically smaller inclusions or changes to the content itself. They tend to be distinguished from remakes, based on the original.

== Mastering ==

A master recording is the definitive recording version that will be replicated for the end user, commonly into other formats (e.g. LP records, tapes, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays).

A batch of copies is often made from a single original master recording, which might itself be based on previous recordings. For example, sound effects (e.g. a door opening, punching sounds, falling down the stairs, a bell ringing) might have been added from copies of sound effect tapes similar to modern sampling to make a radio play for broadcast.

Problematically, several different levels of masters often exist for any one audio release. As an example, examine the way a typical music album from the 1960s was created. Musicians and vocalists were recorded on multi-track tape. This tape was mixed to create a stereo or mono master. A further master tape would likely be created from this original master recording consisting of equalization and other adjustments and improvements to the audio to make it sound better on record players for example.

More master recordings would be duplicated from the equalized master for regional copying purposes (for example to send to several pressing plants). Pressing masters for vinyl recordings would be created. Often these interim recordings were referred to as &quot;mother tapes&quot;. All vinyl records would derive from one of the master recordings.

Thus, &quot;mastering&quot; refers to the process of creating a master. This might be as simple as copying a tape for further duplication purposes or might include the actual equalization and processing steps used to fine-tune material for release. The latter example usually requires the work of mastering engineers.

With the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, many mastering ideas changed. Previously, creating new masters meant incurring an analog generational loss; in other words, copying a tape to a tape meant reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. This means how much of the original intended &quot;good&quot; information is recorded against faults added to the recording as a result of the technical limitations of the equipment used (noise, e.g. tape hiss, static, etc.). Although noise reduction techniques exist, they also increase other audio distortions such as azimuth shift, wow and flutter, print-through and stereo image shift.

With digital recording, masters could be created and duplicated without incurring the usual generational loss. As CDs were a digital format, digital masters created from original analog recordings became a necessity.

== Remastering ==

Remastering is the process of making a new master for an album, film, or any other creation. It tends to refer to the process of porting a recording from an analog medium to a digital one, but this is not always the case.

For example, a vinyl LP – originally pressed from a worn-out pressing master many tape generations removed from the &quot;original&quot; master recording – could be remastered and re-pressed from a better-condition tape. All CDs created from analog sources are technically digitally remastered.

The process of creating a digital transfer of an analog tape remasters the material in the digital domain, even if no equalization, compression, or other processing is done to the material. Ideally, because of their higher resolution, a CD or DVD (or even higher quality like high-resolution audio or hi-def video) release should come from the best source possible, with the most care taken during its transfer.

Additionally, the earliest days of the CD era found digital technology in its infancy, which sometimes resulted in poor-sounding digital transfers. The early DVD era was not much different, with copies of films frequently being produced from worn prints, with low bitrates and muffled audio. When the first CD remasters turned out to be bestsellers, companies soon realized that new editions of back-catalog items could compete with new releases as a source of revenue. Back-catalog values skyrocketed, and today it is not unusual to see expanded and remastered editions of relatively modern albums.

Master tapes, or something close to them, can be used to make CD releases. Better processing choices can be used. Better prints can be utilized, with sound elements remixed to 5.1 surround sound and obvious print flaws digitally corrected. The modern era gives publishers almost unlimited ways to touch up, doctor, and &quot;improve&quot; their media, and as each release promises improved sound, video, extras and others, producers hope these upgrades will entice people into making a purchase.

=== Music ===
Remastering music for CD or even digital distribution starts from locating the original analog version.&lt;ref name=&quot;How Stuff Works CD/DVD remaster&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The next step involves digitizing the track or tracks so it can be edited using a computer. Then the track order is chosen. This is something engineers often worry about because if the track order is not right, it may seem sonically unbalanced.

When the remastering starts, engineers use software tools such as a limiter, an equalizer, and a compressor. The compressor and limiters are ways of controlling the loudness of a track. This is not to be confused with the volume of a track, which is controlled by the listener during playback.

The dynamic range of an audio track is measured by calculating the variation between the loudest and the quietest part of a track. In recording studios the loudness is measured with negative decibels, zero designating the loudest recordable sound. A limiter works by having a certain cap on the loudest parts and if that cap is exceeded, it is automatically lowered by a ratio preset by the engineer.

==== Criticism ====
Remastered audio has been the subject of criticism. Many remastered CDs from the late 1990s onwards have been affected by the &quot;loudness war&quot;, where the average volume of the recording is increased and dynamic range is compressed at the expense of clarity, making the remastered version sound louder at regular listening volume and more distorted than an uncompressed version. Some have also criticized the overuse of noise reduction in the remastering process, as it affects not only the noise, but the signal too, and can leave audible artifacts.
Equalisation can change the character of a recording noticeably. As EQ decisions are a matter of taste to some degree, they are often the subject of criticism. Mastering engineers such as Steve Hoffman have noted that using flat EQ on a mastering allows listeners to adjust the EQ on their equipment to their own preference, but mastering a release with a certain EQ means that it may not be possible to get a recording to sound right on high-end equipment.
Additionally, from an artistic point of view, original mastering involved the original artist, but remastering often does not. Therefore, a remastered record may not sound how the artist originally intended.

=== Film and television ===

To remaster a movie digitally for DVD and Blu-ray, digital restoration operators must scan in the film frame by frame at a resolution of at least 2,048 pixels across (referred to as 2K resolution). Some films are scanned at 4K, 6K, or even 8K resolution to be ready for higher resolution devices. Scanning a film at 4K—a resolution of 4096 × 3092 for a full frame of film—generates at least 12 terabytes of data before any editing is done.

Digital restoration operators then use specialist software such as MTI&#x27;s Digital Restoration System (DRS) to remove scratches and dust from damaged film. Restoring the film to its original color is also included in this process.

As well as remastering the video aspect, the audio is also remastered using such software as Pro Tools to remove background noise and boost dialogue volumes so when actors are speaking they are easier to understand and hear. Audio effects are also added or enhanced, as well as surround sound, which allows the soundtrack elements to be spread among multiple speakers for a more immersive experience.

An example of a restored film is the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The color portions of &quot;Oz&quot; were shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, which in the 1930s yielded three black and white negatives created from red, green and blue light filters which were used to print the cyan, magenta and yellow portions of the final printed color film answer print. These three negatives were scanned individually into a computer system, where the digital images were tinted and combined using proprietary software.

The cyan, magenta, and yellow records had suffered from shrinkage over the decades, and the software used in the restoration morphed all three records into the correct alignment. The software was also used to remove dust and scratches from the film by copying data, for example, from the cyan and yellow records to fix a blemish in the magenta record. Restoring the movie made it possible to see precise visual details not visible on earlier home releases: for example, when the Scarecrow says &quot;I have a brain&quot;, burlap is noticeable on his cheeks. It was also not possible to see a rivet between the Tin Man&#x27;s eyes prior to the restoration.

Shows that were shot and edited entirely on film, such as &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, are able to be re-released in HD through re-scanning the original film negatives; the remastering process for the show additionally enabled Paramount to digitally update certain special effects. Shows that were made between the early 1980s and the early 2000s were generally shot on film, then transferred to and edited on standard-definition videotape, making high-definition transfers impossible without re-editing the product from scratch, such as with the HD release of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which cost Paramount over $12 million to produce. Because of this release&#x27;s commercial failure, Paramount chose not to give &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; or &quot;Voyager&quot; the same treatment. In 2014, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; was digitally remastered from the original film and audio tracks.

==== Criticism ====
Remastered movies have been the subject of criticism. When the Arnold Schwarzenegger film &quot;Predator&quot; was remastered, it was felt by some critics that the process was overdone, resulting in Schwarzenegger&#x27;s skin looking waxy. As well as complaints about the way the picture looks, there have been other complaints about digital fixing. One notable complaint is from the 2002 remastered version of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), where director Steven Spielberg replaced guns in the hands of police and federal agents with walkie-talkies. A later 30th-anniversary edition released in 2012 saw the return of the original scene.

=== Animation ===
With regard to animation—both for television and film—&quot;remastering&quot; can take on a different context, including altering original images to extremes.

For traditionally animated projects, completed on cels and printed to film, remastering can be as simple as touching up a film negative. There have been times where these revisions have been controversial: boxed DVD sets of animated properties like &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; from the early 2000s saw extensive criticism from fans and historians due to the aggressive use of digital video noise reduction (DVNR). The process was designed to automatically remove dust or specks from the image, but would mistake stray ink lines or smudges on the cel for damage, as well as removing natural imperfections. Disney went a step farther with its remastering of its canon catalog in the early 21st century: for its cel-animated films, teams meticulously reconstructed scenes from original cel setups and background paintings to create new images free of film artifacts (jitter, grain, etc.). While complex and revolutionary, this process was criticized by some for essentially removing the films from their era and medium, making them indistinguishable in age. Later remasters, including a 4K restoration of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 2023, prioritized a filmic look, with period-appropriate grain and weave.

Remastering other animated projects can vary in scope based on their art style. In the case of natively digital images, including computer-animated films, remastering can be a simple matter of going back to the original files and re-rendering them at a desired resolution. Some modern software, like Toon Boom Harmony, utilize lossless vector shapes, allowing an artist to re-render work at different resolutions with ease. This can prove tricky at times when files have become corrupted or unreadable; a 3D reissue of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first CG film, was fraught with difficulties due to the unreadability of the file format on modern systems. In television, &quot;South Park&quot; is an example of a program that was natively digital from its start—its construction paper style was made up of digital images manipulated in software like Maya. This allowed its creative team to completely re-render episodes in a higher resolution than its original broadcast; in some instances shots were re-framed to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Another issue in terms of remastering is upscaling projects completed in the early days of digital ink and paint. Animation industries across the globe gradually switched from cels to digital coloring around the turn of the millennium, and projects that pre-date the advent of higher-resolution formats have proved challenging to remaster. Remasters of films that used early digipaint processes are typically struck from filmout 35mm prints, as the computer files were never properly archived. Projects that were composited on lower resolution formats like videotape have made going back to the original elements impractical due to their inferior size. Some studios have utilized artificial intelligence to professionally upscale the material; boutique label Discotek has released seasons of the anime &quot;Digimon&quot; using a specialized tool called AstroRes.

=== Video games ===

Remastering a video game is more difficult than remastering a film or music recording because the video game&#x27;s graphics show their age. This can be due to a number of factors, notably lower resolutions and less complicated rendering engines at the time of release. A video game remaster typically has ambience and design updated to the capabilities of a more powerful console, while a video game remake is also updated but with recreated models.

Modern computer monitors and high-definition televisions tend to have higher display resolutions and different aspect ratios than the monitors/televisions available when the video game was released. Because of this, classic games that are remastered typically have their graphics re-rendered at higher resolutions. An example of a game that has had its original graphics re-rendered at higher resolutions is &quot;Hitman HD Trilogy&quot;, which contains two games with high-resolution graphics: &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Both were originally released on PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The original resolution was 480p on Xbox, while the remastered resolution is displayed at 720p on Xbox 360. There is some debate regarding whether graphics of an older game at higher resolutions make a video game look better or worse than the original artwork, with comparisons made to colorizing black-and-white-movies.

More significant than low resolution is the age of the original game engine and simplicity of the original 3D models. Older computers and video game consoles had limited 3D rendering speed, which required simple 3D object geometry such as human hands being modeled as mittens rather than with individual fingers, while maps having a distinctly chunky appearance with no smoothly curving surfaces. Older computers also had less texture memory for 3D environments, requiring low-resolution bitmap images that look visibly pixelated or blurry when viewed at high resolution. (Some early 3D games such as the 1993 version of DOOM also just used an animated two-dimensional image that is rotated to always face the player character, rather than attempt to render highly complex scenery objects or enemies in full 3D.) As a result, depending on the age of the original game, if the original assets are not compatible with the new technology for a remaster, it is often considered necessary to remake or remodel the graphical assets. An example of a game that has had its graphics redesigned is &quot;&quot;, while the core character and level information is exactly the same as in &quot;&quot;.

<text>Hari Kostov (; born 13 November 1959) is a Macedonian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Macedonia from May 2004 until his resignation in November 2004.

He was appointed to the position of Prime Minister by the parliament on May 31, 2004, two weeks after being nominated by President Branko Crvenkovski. Kostov was an economic advisor to the Macedonian government and the World Bank during the 1980s and 1990s. He was the interior minister in the previous government, which was led by Crvenkovski and lasted from 2002 until 2004, and ended when Crvenkovski was elected president. Kostov retained most officials from the Crvenkovski government.
Kostov announced his resignation on November 15, 2004, following disputes within the coalition government, particularly between ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian ministers. He left office on November 18, 2004, when his resignation was accepted, and was succeeded by the defence minister, Vlado Bučkovski.

Currently, he is chief executive of the Komercijalna Bank Skopje (Комерцијална Банка Скопје), a position which he also had before entering the Macedonian government.

<doc id="700164" wikidata="Q1390451" url="?curid=700164" title="John Hodiak">
<text>John Hodiak ( ; April 16, 1914 – October 19, 1955) was an American actor who worked in radio, stage and film.

== Early life ==
Hodiak was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Anna (Pogorzelec) and Walter Hodiak. He was of Ukrainian and Polish descent. Hodiak grew up in Hamtramck, Michigan.

== Acting career ==
=== Radio ===
When Hodiak first tried out for a radio acting job, he was turned down because of his accent. He became a caddie at a Detroit golf course, then worked at a Chevrolet automobile factory – and practised his diction. When he conquered the diction hurdle, he became a radio actor and moved to Chicago. There Hodiak created the role of the comic strip character Li&#x27;l Abner on radio.

Hodiak also had the role of McCullough in the radio soap opera &quot;Girl Alone&quot;.

=== Hollywood ===
Hodiak was cast in a few small parts at MGM, including &quot;A Stranger in Town&quot; (1943), &quot;I Dood It&quot; (1943) and &quot;Maisie Goes to Reno&quot; (1944).

=== Stardom ===
Hodiak then caught the eye of director Alfred Hitchcock, and on loan to 20th Century Fox, he was featured in &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944) opposite Tallulah Bankhead.

MGM cast him in the third lead in &quot;Song of Russia&quot; (1944), supporting Robert Taylor and Susan Peters. He was Ann Sothern&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Maisie Goes to Reno&quot; (1944) and had a role in &quot;Marriage Is a Private Affair&quot; (1944).

20th Century Fox borrowed Hodiak again to play the title role in &quot;Sunday Dinner for a Soldier&quot; (1944), with Anne Baxter, whom he married in real life. Fox kept him on to play Maj. Joppolo in &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; (1945) with Gene Tierney.

At MGM, Hodiak had a role as Judy Garland&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946).

Fox gave him a starring role in &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; (1946), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Hodiak acted with Lucille Ball in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Two Smart People&quot; (1946), which lost money, as did the film noir &quot;The Arnelo Affair&quot; (1947).

=== Supporting actor ===
Hodiak went to Paramount for &quot;Desert Fury&quot; (1947), playing the lead with Lizabeth Scott and Burt Lancaster. He starred in &quot;Love from a Stranger&quot; (1947) for Eagle Lion, then supported Lana Turner and Clark Gable in &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1948). He supported Gable again in &quot;Command Decision&quot; (1948). The two Gable films were hits but Hodiak was voted &quot;box office poison&quot; by exhibitors at the end of 1948.

Hodiak was down the cast list for &quot;The Bribe&quot; (1949). He was second billed in MGM&#x27;s war film &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949), a huge success. Also popular was &quot;Malaya&quot; (1949) where Hodiak supported James Stewart and Spencer Tracy.

Hodiak was a love rival for Robert Taylor in &quot;Ambush&quot; (1950), a popular Western. MGM gave him another lead role, co-starring with Hedy Lamarr in &quot;A Lady Without Passport&quot; (1950), but it lost money. He was third billed in &quot;The Miniver Story&quot; (1950), the flop sequel to &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, and fourth lead in &quot;Night into Morning&quot; (1951), an unsuccessful drama.

Hodiak supported Spencer Tracy in &quot;The People Against O&#x27;Hara&quot; (1951) and Clark Gable in &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; (1952). He was second billed to Walter Pidgeon in &quot;The Sellout&quot; (1953).

=== Broadway and B movies ===
In 1952, Hodiak went to New York City and made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Chase&quot; by Horton Foote and directed by José Ferrer. The play was a failure, but its star received positive notices.

Hodiak went to Allied Artists to star in the movie &quot;Battle Zone&quot; (1952). He starred in two Westerns, &quot;Ambush at Tomahawk Gap&quot; (1953) and &quot;Conquest of Cochise&quot; (1953), and then the war movies &quot;Mission Over Korea&quot; (1953) and &quot;Dragonfly Squadron&quot; (1954).

He originated the role of Lieutenant Maryk in Paul Gregory&#x27;s production of the play &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court Martial&quot; (1954–1955) by Herman Wouk adapted from his novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;. The play, starring Henry Fonda and Lloyd Nolan, ran for two years, and Hodiak&#x27;s portrayal brought him acclaim.

When the show closed after its U.S. tour, Hodiak began work on &quot;Trial&quot; (1955) at MGM, billed fourth as the prosecuting attorney. When it wrapped, he played Major Ward Thomas in &quot;On the Threshold of Space&quot; (1956) at 20th Century Fox.

== Personal life ==
Hodiak and actress Anne Baxter (whom he met while they were starring in &quot;Sunday Dinner for a Soldier&quot;) married on July 7, 1946, and divorced on January 27, 1953. They had one daughter, Katrina Hodiak, who became an actress.

== Death ==
Hodiak suffered a fatal heart attack in October 1955 at his parents&#x27; home in Tarzana, California. He was acting in &quot;On the Threshold of Space&quot;; it was decided that his performance was sufficient to release the movie. He is interred in Block 303, Crypt D-1 of the main mausoleum at Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.
He left an estate of $25,000.

== Legacy ==
Hodiak has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Boulevard, for his work in radio.

<text>Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (often abbreviated and referred to as D.R.I.) is an American crossover thrash band that formed in Houston, Texas in 1982 and would later relocate to San Francisco, California. The band is currently composed of two of its founding members, lead vocalist Kurt Brecht and guitarist Spike Cassidy, as well as bassist Greg Orr and drummer Rob Rampy.

D.R.I. never gained a mainstream audience, but the integration of their hardcore punk roots with thrash metal influences was a stylistic catalyst for their contemporariesmost notably Suicidal Tendencies, Corrosion of Conformity, Stormtroopers of Death, the Cro-Mags, Nuclear Assault, Adrenalin O.D., and Cryptic Slaughteralongside whom they are considered to be one of the major pioneers of what would later be called &quot;crossover thrash&quot;. These bands had a heavy influence on modern thrash metal.

To date, D.R.I. has released seven full-length studio albums. Other than three new songs on the 2016 EP &quot;But Wait... There&#x27;s More!&quot;, they have not released a full-length studio album since &quot;Full Speed Ahead&quot; in 1995. Despite this, the band has continued to tour almost every year, and gone on hiatus intermittently, notably between 2004 and 2009, when Cassidy was diagnosed with colon cancer. Since the late 1990s, D.R.I. has been working on their eighth full-length studio album, which remains unreleased.

==History==
=== Early days (1982–1986) ===
Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (then-called US D.R.I.) was formed in Houston in May 1982 by former members of the hardcore punk band Suburbanites. The original line-up consisted of Spike Cassidy on guitar, Kurt Brecht on lead vocals, Eric Brecht on drums and Dennis Johnson on bass, which was basically the Suburbanites with Cassidy on guitar. Cassidy&#x27;s roommate played guitar in the Suburbanites.

The group started practicing at Kurt and Eric&#x27;s parents&#x27; home. The noise made by the band allegedly drew regular complaints from Kurt and Eric&#x27;s father. This led to the band gaining their name when they were described as a &quot;bunch of dirty rotten imbeciles.&quot; This was also an inspiration for the song &quot;Madman,&quot; which featured a clip of Kurt and Eric&#x27;s father interrupting a band practice to complain about the noise. They initially went under the name US D.R.I for a brief period before shortening it to D.R.I. Presumably, the &quot;US&quot; stood for the band, as mentioned in interviews off of the extended version of the &quot;Dirty Rotten CD.&quot; Photos of the band can be found with the original US D.R.I logo. The &quot;Skanker Man&quot; logo was designed by original drummer Eric Brecht as a high school art assignment to create a &quot;corporate&quot; logo. He received an &quot;A&quot; on it.

Two months later, on July 2, 1982, the band played their first show at Joe Star&#x27;s OMNI, in Houston.

On November 6 and 7, 1982, D.R.I. recorded their first release, the &quot;Dirty Rotten EP&quot;, fitting 22 songs into 18 minutes on a 7-inch EP. Not long before its release, US D.R.I. had changed their name to just D.R.I., and only 1000 copies of the EP version were pressed, making it now a collector&#x27;s item. Demand caused this EP to be pressed into a 12-inch LP version, also released in 1983, aptly titled &quot;Dirty Rotten LP&quot;.

In 1983, D.R.I. relocated to from Texas to San Francisco, where they lived in their van and ate at soup kitchens between gigs. Dennis Johnson quit the band and returned home to Texas. He was replaced with Sebastion Amok, and within a few months D.R.I. embarked on their first tour, appearing on the &quot;Rock Against Reagan&quot; tour with MDC and the Dead Kennedys. After the tour, Josh Pappe was brought in to replace Sebastian Amok who would eventually join The Dicks, another Texas band.

Their next release was the four-song 7-inch EP &quot;Violent Pacification&quot; in 1984. After touring in the summer of 1984, Eric Brecht got married and left the band. He was replaced with a 17-year-old Felix Griffin. Also in 1984, one of their songs, &quot;Snap&quot; appeared on the anti-war benefit compilation &quot;P.E.A.C.E.&quot; along with other famous hardcore and punk bands such as Crass, D.O.A., Dead Kennedys and MDC.

D.R.I.&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Dealing with It!&quot;, was released in March 1985 on Metal Blade Records. The group toured extensively in support of the album. During the recording of the album, Josh Pappe took a leave from the band. Mikey Offender (Mikey Donaldson bass player of The Offenders) was asked to play for the album, although Spike played bass on the songs that Donaldson did not have time to learn. The songs on &quot;Dealing with It!&quot; leaned slightly towards a metal direction, but still kept the band&#x27;s thrashcore sound. As a result, D.R.I. toured relentlessly throughout 1985 and 1986 in support of &quot;Dealing with It!&quot;, and it was on this tour that the band gained a wide audience by performing with thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Overkill and Hirax, while continuing to perform with their hardcore punk peers, including Discharge, Corrosion of Conformity, Bad Brains, T.S.O.L., JFA, Descendents, Verbal Abuse, Gang Green and Cryptic Slaughter. Also on this tour, they recorded their show at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles on April 26, 1986, and released it on video, which was entitled &quot;Live at the Olympic&quot;.

===Crossover thrash period (1987–1996)===
When Felix joined D.R.I. in 1984, he brought a new audience to the shows. The next three years the band toured and started developing a new genre, (along with other pioneers) crossover. Their third album, &quot;Crossover&quot;, released in 1987, was aptly named, as the songs on this album had a strong metal sound to them. As the band began to cross over to thrash, their songs became longer, slower, and more complex. The press has called D.R.I. the major band of the &quot;crossover&quot; movement, a style that combined hardcore punk and thrash metal. This music invited a mixed audience of punks, skinheads, and metal fans to their shows. Thanks to this movement, &quot;Crossover&quot; helped expand D.R.I.&#x27;s popularity worldwide, including touring Europe and Australia for the first time, and opening for a variety of bands such as The Exploited and Anthrax.

The &quot;Live At The Ritz&quot; video was recorded next, on June 27, 1987, at The Ritz in New York, during the band&#x27;s worldwide Crossover tour.

In February 1988, the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles returned to the studio to record &quot;4 of a Kind&quot;. The songs on this album continued in the band&#x27;s metal style. They released a music video for the song &quot;Suit and Tie Guy&quot;, and the &quot;Dirty Rotten LP&quot; was remixed to include the songs from the &quot;Violent Pacification EP&quot;, and was re-released. The band toured worldwide again to support the &quot;4 of a Kind&quot; album, first in North America with Kreator and Holy Terror, and Europe with The Exploited and Gang Green. Just before they started working on their next album, Josh Pappe left D.R.I. because of an offer to play for Gang Green. He was replaced by John Menor.

In October 1989, D.R.I. released their fifth album &quot;Thrash Zone&quot;. Continuing in the same vein as &quot;4 of a Kind&quot;, the album was another success for D.R.I. and two music videos were released to accompany it, &quot;Beneath the Wheel&quot; and &quot;Abduction&quot;. The band toured for almost two years in support of &quot;Thrash Zone&quot;, mainly in Europe and North America, performing with numerous bands such as Nasty Savage, Sick of It All, Corrosion of Conformity, Mordred, Excel, Uncle Slam, Cryptic Slaughter, Dead Horse, Atrophy and Bitter End.

In 1990, Felix Griffin left the group and was replaced by Rob Rampy. Around the same time, D.R.I. had severed ties with Metal Blade Records and it took over two years and a search for a new label, until the band&#x27;s own imprint Rotten Records released the band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Definition&quot; in October 1992. A music video was released for the song, &quot;Acid Rain&quot;. The video would later be featured in an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

D.R.I. toured throughout 1992 and 1993 in support of &quot;Definition&quot;, including opening for Testament, as well as headlining their own shows. During this tour, they recorded their gig at the Hollywood Palladium on November 27, 1992, and it was released in 1994 as their first live album, appropriately entitled &quot;Live&quot;. It was, more or less, &quot;released as a stepping stone between &quot;Definition&quot; and &quot;Full Speed Ahead&quot;&quot;. Soon after recording the show, John Menor left D.R.I. and was replaced by the band&#x27;s long time friend and roadie, Chumly Porter.

The group took part in headlining the Lolitabazooka Tour in the fall of 1994. However, the band was less active during this period and focused on extracurricular activities.

In November 1995, D.R.I. released &quot;Full Speed Ahead&quot;. They also made another music video, this time for a song called &quot;Syringes In The Sandbox&quot;.

In January 1996, they started touring North America with Acid Bath opening for them. But in April, two band members ran into trouble trying to enter Canada, because they had both been previously charged with driving under the influence in the U.S. This resulted in the cancellation of all their Canadian tour dates.

=== Touring (1997–2005) ===

During 1997 and 1998, D.R.I. continued to tour the world extensively, including European and South American dates. Also in 1998, D.R.I. announced that they were writing songs for the follow-up to &quot;Full Speed Ahead&quot;, including &quot;Against Me&quot;, &quot;As Seen on TV&quot;, &quot;Bad News&quot;, &quot;Brick Wall View&quot;, &quot;Destructive Power&quot;, &quot;Insanity Plea&quot;, &quot;Saddam Insane&quot;, &quot;Sweaty Deli Tray&quot; and &quot;Wrong as Usual&quot;; the former of the two would be released 18 years later on &quot;But Wait... There&#x27;s More!&quot;. Steady touring, as well as the band&#x27;s slow writing and recording pace and the search for a record label, resulted in putting the album on hold for over half a decade; eventually they were signed to Beer City Records. By the spring of 2004, D.R.I. had demoed at least four new songs for a potential eighth studio album, including &quot;Against Me&quot;, which was available downloading at the &quot;record news&quot; page from their official web site for several years.

During 1999, D.R.I. appeared as one of the headlining bands on the &quot;Social Chaos&quot; in North America Tour. One of their songs, &quot;I&#x27;m The Liar&quot;, is used for a Social Chaos Tour CD compilation. During August 1999, in the middle of the tour, Chumly left the band after tiring of touring. He was replaced by Harald Oimoen. Oimoen had been working on and off with the band for years, doing everything from photography and merchandise to bass tech. The band resumed the tour missing only two shows.

The turn of the millennium saw the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles headline the &quot;Millennium 2000 Tour&quot;. The constant cycle of touring continued into 2001 with D.R.I. extensively touring the United States on the &quot;Old School Tour&quot; culminating in a headlining appearance at the Milwaukee Metal Fest, and other tours of the United States, Japan, Europe and South America into 2003. In 2003, Beer City reissued &quot;Dirty Rotten CD,&quot; which featured the original full length &quot;Dirty Rotten LP&quot; and the &quot;Violent Pacification&quot; 7-inch EP as well as a number of never-before-released bonus tracks and interviews. Included within the bonus tracks were live recordings of D.R.I.&#x27;s first show ever and footage from the band&#x27;s only performance at New York&#x27;s famous CBGB&#x27;s from the 1984 &quot;Violent Pacification&quot; tour. In 2003, Beer City also reissued &quot;Dealing with It!&quot;; the CD contained the original album plus never-before-heard bonus tracks as well as live video footage including a mid-80s interview from a San Francisco Public-access television cable TV show.

After another tour in 2004, the band released &quot;Live At CBGB&#x27;s&quot; CD and DVD, and the reissue of the &quot;Crossover&quot; album, all on Beer City. The reissue of &quot;Crossover&quot; was delayed due to Cassidy&#x27;s illness.

=== Hiatus, recovery of Cassidy, and continued touring (2006–2010) ===

In March 2006, Cassidy was diagnosed with colon cancer, which put the band&#x27;s performances and recording on hiatus until his recovery. In December 2006, Cassidy had completed all radiation and chemotherapy; a one-foot section of the large intestine (colon) was removed through an eight-inch incision in his stomach. An announcement on the band&#x27;s website declared Cassidy cancer free as of August 2008.

Cassidy commented on his return to the stage: &quot;I am very happy D.R.I. will be playing again, it has been far too long. We are currently setting up weekends to test the water and rebuild the stamina that we were known for. We all look forward to restarting up exactly where we left off.&quot;

On April 13, 2010, Beer City Records reissued &quot;Crossover – Millennium Edition&quot; on LP and CD. Finally after many years &quot;Crossover&quot; was once again available. This reissue was remastered by the original co-producer/engineer Bill Metoyer. The CD version contains eleven bonus tracks including five songs from their performance at NYC&#x27;s The Ritz. That same year, the label reissued &quot;The Dirty Rotten EP&quot;, &quot;The Dirty Rotten LP&quot;, &quot;Violent Pacification&quot; 7-inch and &quot;Dealing with It!&quot; on vinyl.

=== &quot;But Wait... There&#x27;s More!&quot;, lineup changes and possible new album (2011–present) ===

From 2011 through 2019, the band regularly trekked the United States, as well as tours of the United Kingdom, Europe, and South America. The COVID-19 pandemic canceled or postponed dates in 2020 but the band returned to the road in 2021 and planned for a 40th-anniversary tour in 2022 across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Central America.

D.R.I. entered a Southern California studio in October 2014 to begin recording an EP containing new material. It was produced by Bill Metoyer, who produced the band&#x27;s later studio albums. The EP, titled &quot;But Wait... There&#x27;s More!&quot;, was released on June 10, 2016. Vocalist Kurt Brecht has described the EP as &quot;more punk rock than metal&quot;.

Although no longer working with D.R.I., one of the band&#x27;s old record labels, Rotten Records, in 2015, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in a suit against a Comcast user who allegedly downloaded and shared the band&#x27;s sixth album. According to the lawsuit, Rotten Records hired Rightscorp to monitor BitTorrent networks for infringement. The company claims it connected to the defendants&#x27; BitTorrent clients and downloaded a full copy of the album, later verifying that they were identical to the original copyright works.

On September 17, 2014, it was announced that Rob Rampy had departed from the band, citing serious injury as the reason. He was then replaced by Brandon Karns, who subsequently left the band shortly thereafter. Karns was then replaced by Walter &quot;Monsta&quot; Ryan. However, Rampy re-joined D.R.I in 2018. In 2017, the band parted ways with their longtime bassist Harald Oimoen, who was replaced by Greg Orr (ex-Attitude Adjustment).

In January 2019, Metal Addicts reported that D.R.I. had been working on their first full-length studio album since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Full Speed Ahead&quot;, though no new material has been released as of 2025.

== Musical style and legacy ==

D.R.I.&#x27;s music has combined elements of punk rock, thrash metal, speed metal, and heavy metal, while their early material has been described as hardcore punk. They are often cited as one of the key bands that helped create the crossover thrash genre, along with S.O.D., Suicidal Tendencies and Corrosion of Conformity. Allmusic.com has claimed that, &quot;Starting off as a speedy, straight-ahead punk band, they gradually mixed more elements of heavy metal into their sound; as they did so, their songs got longer and featured more sections and more variety in tempo. D.R.I. managed the then-rare feat of crossing over to metal audiences while retaining their skate-punk and hardcore fan bases they had something for all those audiences to love (or hate).&quot;

Many bands and artists have cited D.R.I. as an influence or inspiration, including Anthrax, Cryptic Slaughter, Dark Angel, Death Angel, Kreator, Municipal Waste, Nuclear Assault, Slayer and Vio-Lence.

<text>Jacob Dolson Cox, Jr. (October 27, 1828August 4, 1900), was a statesman, lawyer, Union Army general during the American Civil War, Republican politician from Ohio, Liberal Republican Party founder, educator, author, and recognized microbiologist. He served as president of the University of Cincinnati, the 28th governor of Ohio and as United States Secretary of the Interior. As Governor of Ohio, Cox sided for a time with President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction plan and was against African American suffrage in the South, though he supported it in Ohio. However, Cox increasingly expressed racist and segregationist viewpoints, advocating a separate colony for blacks to &quot;work out their own salvation.&quot; Seeing himself caught between Johnson and the Radical Republicans, Cox decided not to run for reelection. He stayed out of politics for a year, though both Sherman and Grant advocated that Cox replace Stanton as Secretary of War as a means of stemming the demands for Johnson&#x27;s impeachment. But Johnson declined. When Ulysses S. Grant became president, he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior, and Cox immediately accepted.

Secretary of Interior Cox implemented the first civil service reform in a federal government department, including examinations for most clerks. Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform, creating America&#x27;s first Civil Service Commission. However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers, who ultimately convinced Grant to cease civil service reforms in the Interior, a large department coveted for its vast Congressional patronage. President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty. Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre. Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant&#x27;s support over civil service reform. Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as president. In 1871 Cox helped found the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant&#x27;s renomination. In 1876, Cox returned to politics and served one term as a United States Congressman from Ohio. Congressman Cox supported President Hayes&#x27;s reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform.

Cox was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1870.

Cox was elected U.S. Representative (Ohio) and served in Congress from 1877 to 1879. Afterward, Cox never returned to active politics. Cox served as president and receiver of a railroad, Dean of Cincinnati Law School, and as president of the University of Cincinnati. Cox also studied microscopy and made hundreds of photo-micrographs, and in 1881 he was elected fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society. In 1882, Cox started a series of books he authored on Civil War campaigns, which remain today respected histories and memoirs. After Cox retired in 1897, he died in Massachusetts in 1900. Throughout the 20th century, Cox&#x27;s life was mostly forgotten by historians, however, there has been renewed interest during the 21st century in Cox&#x27;s military career as Union general during the Civil War, and his implementation of civil service while Secretary of Interior under President Grant, the first cabinet officer to do so in U.S. history.

==Early years and education==
Jacob Dolson Cox was born in Montreal (then located in the British colonial Province of Lower Canada) on October 27, 1828. His father and mother respectively were Jacob Dolson Cox and Thedia Redelia (Kenyon) Cox, both Americans and residents of New York. His father Jacob was of Dutch origin, descended from Hanoverian emigrant Michael Cox (Koch) who arrived in New York in 1702. His mother Thedia was descended from Revolutionary War Connecticut soldier Payne Kenyon who was there when British General John Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga in 1777. Thedia also was descended from Revolutionary War Connecticut soldier Freeman Allyn, who fought against Benedict Arnold at Groton. The Allyns were the early settlers of Salem and Manchester, Massachusetts. Thedia was additionally descended from the Elder William Brewster who emigrated to the Plymouth Colony on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620.

The elder Jacob was a New York building contractor and superintended the roof construction of the Church of Notre Dame in Montreal. Cox returned with his parents to New York City a year later. His early education included private readings with a Columbia College student. His family suffered a financial setback during the Panic of 1837, and Cox was unable to afford a college education and obtain a law degree. New York State law mandated that an alternative to college would be to work as an apprentice in the legal firm for seven years before entering the bar. In 1842, Cox entered into an apprenticeship for a legal firm and worked for two years. Having changed his mind on becoming a lawyer, Cox worked as a bookkeeper in a brokerage firm and studied mathematics and classical languages in his off hours. In 1846 he enrolled at Oberlin College in the preparatory school having been influenced by the Reverends Samuel D. Cochran and Charles Grandison Finney, leaders of Oberlin College to study theology and become a minister. Oberlin College was a progressive educational facility that was coeducational and admitted students of different races. He graduated from Oberlin with a degree in theology in 1850 or 1851. After a disagreement with his father-in-law over theology, Cox left his ministerial studies and became superintendent of the Warren, Ohio, school system. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1853.

==Marriage and family==
While attending Oberlin, Cox married the eldest daughter of college president Finney in 1849; at age 19, Helen Clarissa Finney was already a widow with a small son. The couple lived with the president, but Cox and his father-in-law became estranged due to theological disputes. Cox was the father of the painter Kenyon Cox; his grandson, Allyn Cox, was a noted muralist.

==Political and military career==
Cox was a Whig and had voted for Winfield Scott in 1852, having strong family abolitionist ties. As the Whig party dissolved, in 1855 Cox helped to organize the Republican Party in Ohio and stumped for its candidates in counties surrounding Warren. Cox was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1859 and formed a political alliance with Senator and future President James A. Garfield, and with Governor Salmon P. Chase. While in the legislature, he accepted a commission with the Ohio Militia as a brigadier general and spent much of the winter of 1860–61 studying military science.

==Civil War==
At the start of the war, Cox was the father of six children (of the eight he and Helen eventually had), but he chose to enter Federal service as an Ohio volunteer. Cox had remained a member of the Ohio state Senate when the Civil War broke out at the Battle of Fort Sumter. Cox joined the Union Army to fulfill Ohio&#x27;s Union quota of troops. On April 3, 1861, Cox was appointed Brigadier General of Ohio Volunteers by Ohio Governor William Dennision.

His first assignment was to command a recruiting camp near Columbus, and then the Kanawha Brigade of the Department of the Ohio. His brigade joined the Department of Western Virginia and fought successfully in the early Kanawha Valley campaign under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. In 1862 the brigade moved to Washington, D.C., and was attached to John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia, but was delayed by McClellan and so did not see action at the Second Battle of Bull Run with the rest of the army. At the beginning of the Maryland Campaign, Cox&#x27;s brigade became the Kanawha Division of the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the Maryland campaign, Cox&#x27;s men took the important city of Frederick, Maryland, and Cox led the assault on the Confederates on September 14, 1862, at the Battle of South Mountain. When corps commander Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno was killed at South Mountain, Cox assumed command of the IX Corps. He suggested to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, formally the commander of IX Corps, but who was commanding a two-corps &quot;wing&quot; of the Army, that he be allowed to return to division command, which was more in keeping with his level of military experience. Burnside refused the suggestion but kept Cox under his supervision at the Battle of Antietam. Burnside allowed Cox to execute all orders from McClellan at the battle, while he remained behind the lines. Cox&#x27;s advancing IX Corps came within minutes of overwhelming the Confederate right wing at Antietam, when they were hit by A.P. Hill&#x27;s division, which forced Cox to withdraw closer to Union lines.

After Antietam, Cox was appointed major general to rank from October 6, 1862, but this appointment expired the following March when the United States Senate felt that there were too many generals of this rank already serving. He was later renominated and confirmed on December 7, 1864. Most of 1863 was quiet for Cox, who was assigned to command the District of Ohio, and later the District of Michigan, in the Department of Ohio.

During the Atlanta, Franklin-Nashville, and Carolinas campaigns of 1864–65, Cox commanded the 3rd Division of the XXIII Corps of the Army of the Ohio, under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield. His 3rd Division provided the main effort in the assault at the Battle of Utoy Creek, August 6, 1864. Cox&#x27;s men broke the Confederate supply line on the Macon and Western Railroad on August 31, leading Confederate General John Bell Hood to abandon Atlanta. During Hood&#x27;s Tennessee Campaign, Cox and his troops narrowly escaped being surrounded by Hood at Spring Hill, Tennessee, and he is credited with saving the center of the Union battle line at the Battle of Franklin in November 1864. Cox led the 3rd Division at the Battle of Wilmington in North Carolina, then took command of the District of Beaufort and a Provisional Corps, which he led at the Battle of Wyse Fork, before it was officially designated the XXIII Corps.

==Governor of Ohio==
Before mustering out of the Army on January 1, 1866, Cox was elected governor of Ohio in October 1865. He served from 1866 to 1868, and post-war issues were dealt with during his tenure. However, his regressive views on African-American suffrage and his earlier endorsement of President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction policy caused him to decide not to run for reelection, having lacked the ability to resolve the division between Ohio Radical Republicans and President Johnson. Cox viewed opposition towards black suffrage and advocacy of segregation as a winning formula for the Ohio GOP, telling Radical Republican colleague James Garfield regarding racial equality: &quot;On that issue, if made, you will be beaten.&quot;

Cox then moved to Cincinnati to practice law.

==Secretary of the Interior (1869–1870)==

Cox was appointed Secretary of the Interior by President Ulysses S. Grant upon his March 4, 1869 Inauguration. Cox served from March 5 to October 31, 1870, a total of 575 days in office. Cox was an effective advocate of civil service reform and introduced a merit system and testing for appointees. His nomination was accepted by reformers and he was immediately confirmed by the Senate. Grant initially gave Cox the freedom to run his department as he saw fit &quot;focused on public service as an advocation, not a career.&quot; However, after Grant failed to back him up against Republican politicians who thrived on the patronage system then rampant in the Interior Department, Cox resigned. As Secretary of Interior Cox was considered an independent thinker. This countered Grant&#x27;s instincts as a military general believing Cox was acting insubordinate to his presidency. Grant&#x27;s own view on Cox&#x27;s resignation, possibly unfairly, was that, &quot;The trouble was that General Cox thought the Interior Department was the whole government, and that Cox was the Interior Department.&quot;

===Implemented civil service reform===
After the Mexican–American War the United States acquired more territories and the Interior Department expanded enormously. Cox&#x27;s responsibilities varied widely, and he administered the Patent, Land, Pensions, and Indian Affairs Offices, the Census, marshalls, and officials of federal court, and was in charge of transcontinental railroads. The growth of the Interior Department had also expanded a spoils system of patronage that many reformers believed was corrupt. The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress. Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president. This gave Cox the authority and opportunity to reform the Interior Department&#x27;s personnel system.

Secretary Cox was an enthusiastic advocate of civil service reform and upon assuming office he was the first federal department head to implement a civil service merit system in a federal department. Cox&#x27;s reforms were to limit the spoils system and check the expansion of the federal government&#x27;s power and influence. Cox fired a third of the clerks unqualified to hold office, and he instituted examinations in the Patent and Census Offices for most applicants, while he requested clerks working in the Patent Office to take the examinations to prove they were worthy to hold office. Many clerks resigned on their own rather than take the examinations. Cox even declined to give his brother a job in the Interior, saying he did not want to be charged with nepotism. Cox&#x27;s moralistic approach to civil service reform would eventually clash with President Grant&#x27;s practical use of patronage appointment powers.

By mid-May 1870, Cox&#x27;s reforms clashed with the patronage driven political system and its leaders. Congressional Republican committee leaders demanded that Cox give departmental employees the &quot;opportunity&quot; to give political assessments. Cox responded that &quot;no subscriptions to political funds or show of political zeal will secure their retention.&quot; Cox made contributions voluntary, but the ability to pass civil service examinations would remain mandatory, to keep their jobs. Cox said that mandatory contributions would be distressful to the employees families financially.

The breaking point came between Cox and Congressional patronage powers, when Cox implemented a 30-day paid leave policy on federal employees at the Interior Department, in part used for the fall campaign. Workers would not be paid for extra days off after the 30-day limit. Prior to electric air conditioning, the hot Summer of 1870 caused employees to use up most of their 30-day vacation time, leaving only a few days of paid campaigning. Many clerks complained to party leaders Senator Zachariah Chandler and Senator Simon Cameron, saying they could not campaign, putting the blame on Cox&#x27;s 30 vacation policy. Cameron was reported to have said, &quot;Damn Secretary Cox ! We&#x27;ll see the President about this fool business.&quot; The pressure from party leaders worked, and on October 3, 1870, Grant overturned Cox&#x27;s 30 day vacation rule.

===Dominican Republic annexation treaty===
Even before Grant became president, an annexationist faction in American politics desired control over the Caribbean islands. William H. Seward, Secretary of State under Lincoln and Johnson, having purchased Alaska from the Russians and attempted to buy the Danish West Indies from the Danes, began negotiations to purchase the Dominican Republic, then referred to as Santo Domingo. These negotiations continued under Grant, led by Orville E. Babcock, a confidant who had served on Grant&#x27;s staff during the Civil War. Grant was initially skeptical, but at the urging of Admiral Porter, who wanted a naval base at Samaná Bay, and Joseph W. Fabens, a New England businessman employed by the Dominican government, Grant examined the matter and became convinced of its wisdom. Grant believed in peaceful expansion of the nation&#x27;s borders and thought the majority-black island would allow new economic opportunities for freedmen. The acquisition, according to Grant, would ease race relations in the South, clear slavery from Brazil and Cuba, and increase American naval power in the Caribbean.

Grant sent Babcock to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president, to see if the proposal was practical; Babcock returned with a draft treaty of annexation in December 1869. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish told Cox in a private meeting that Babcock had no authorization to make such a treaty. Going against his normal protocol of listening to each Cabinet member, Grant revealed Babcock&#x27;s unauthorized treaty to his cabinet without discussion. Grant casually told his Cabinet he knew Babcock had no authority to make the treaty but he could remedy this by having the treaty authorized by the United States Dominican Republic Consul. All of the Cabinet kept quiet until Secretary Cox spoke up and asked Grant, &quot;But Mr. President, has it been settled, then, that we want to annex Santo Domingo?&quot; Grant blushed and was embarrassed by Cox&#x27;s direct questioning. Grant then turned to his left looking at Secretary Fish and then turned to his right looking at Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell, puffing hard on his cigar. The uncomfortable silence continued until President Grant ordered another item of business. The assembled Cabinet never again spoke on Santo Domingo. Grant personally lobbied Senators to pass the treaty, going so far as to visit Charles Sumner at his home. Fish out of loyalty to Grant authorized and submitted the treaty. The Senate, led by the opposition of Sumner, refused to pass the treaty.

===Indian affairs===
After the Piegan Indian massacre in January 1870, Secretary Cox in March 1870 demanded that Congress implement definitive and lasting legislation on Indian Policy. President Grant, who desired that Indians become &quot;civilized,&quot; had created the Board of Indian Commissioners in 1869 under his Peace policy. Cox defended the integrity of the Commissioners appointed by President Grant. The massacre indirectly helped keep the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of Interior, rather than be transferred to the Department of War. Cox believed that industrial progress such as railroads and telegraph lines were no excuse to break treaties with the Indians. Cox believed that Native Americans derived no benefits from frontier towns that took away pasture lands from the buffalo herds, an Indian food staple. Cox believed that keeping promises to the Indians, rather than breaking treaties, was essential for peace. Cox, however, viewed Indians had low intelligence, were conceited, and made poor diplomats. In 1871, after Cox had resigned from office, Congress and President Grant created a comprehensive law that ended the Indian treaty system; the law treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government, rather than dealing with the tribes as sovereign entities.

In early 1870, Sioux Indians in Wyoming, under the leadership of Chief Red Cloud and Chief Spotted Tail, were upset as white settlers encroached on Indian land. To avoid war, Red Cloud asked to see President Grant, who along with Spotted Tail, were allowed to journey East to Washington. Cox looked forward to their visit, hoping to convince the Sioux chiefs of the federal government&#x27;s commitment to Indian treaties, and also to impress them with the power and grandeur of the nation, so they would be fearful of making war. Arriving in Washington, the chiefs had conversations with Cox, Ely Parker, and President Grant. On June 1, the chiefs were given a tour of Washington, but failed to be awed into submission. On June 2, Cox was scolded by Spotted Tail for not keeping the Treaty of 1868. In response, Cox lectured Spotted Tail that complaining was not manly, and that the Grant administration&#x27;s Indian policies had positive results. Spotted Tail jested to Cox, that Cox would have slit his throat if he had to live through the troubles Spotted Tail was forced to endure. On June 3, Red Cloud took a similar tack as Spotted Tail, emphasizing he would not give up the old ways. Red Cloud asked Cox for food and ammunition so his people could hunt and not starve, railed against broken treaties, and forcing Indians into starvation. Cox put the chiefs off and told them they would speak with President Grant.

On June 7, Cox attempted to placate the Indian chiefs that President Grant, the &quot;Great White Father&quot;, acted not out of fear, but had the desire to do the right thing. Cox told the Indians they would get all they asked for, except for guns, and Cox personally promised to see the treaties were kept to the letter. Meeting the Indians, President Grant was warm and welcome and emphasized the same sentiments as Cox. Grant gave the chiefs a formal State Dinner at the White House, that proved to emphasize a clash of two cultures. The chiefs were given fine foods and wine but were especially fond of strawberry ice cream. Spotted Tail was reported to have commented that his white hosts ate far better foods than the rations sent to the Indians. At their final meeting, Cox offered several more concessions, and allowed the Indians to give names of agents they would prefer to act as interlocutors with the government. Cox also promised to give the chiefs seventeen horses. Red Cloud apologized to Cox for his rudeness, while Cox promised to promote Indian interest. Before returning to Wyoming the Indians visited New York City, and the philanthropist eastern papers demanded a more generous Sioux policy. Cox sent the Indians the promised seventeen horses and arranged for a group of reformers to accompany the promised goods. The arrival of the aid package did much to calm the situation and war was averted. One historian noted that the Washington visit was a success, while Red Cloud adopted a policy of diplomacy rather than war. 

===McGarrahan claims and resignation===
In August 1870, Secretary Cox came into conflict with President Grant over the fraudulent McGarrahan claims. Grant wanted the McGarrahan claims either settled by Congress or if Congress failed to do so then his administration. Although Grant believed there was fraud in the matter he wanted the McGarrahan claims settled. Cox, however, in a letter to the President, told Grant that he wanted nothing to do with the McGarrahan claims, believing that McGarrahan was entirely fraudulent in asking for a patent on land claims in California. Cox stated that one of McGarrahan&#x27;s attorneys was instructed to bribe Cox $20,000 for him to approve that patent. McGarrahan had applied for a patent on California agriculture land to be bought up at a low price. However, the land was actually used for gold mining purposes. Cox appealed to Grant not to have Cox appear before a District Court in regards to the McGarrahan claims and to hold a Cabinet meeting over the matter. Cox believed that the District Court had no jurisdiction over that matter and that the Department of Interior had sole jurisdiction. When Grant gave no support to Cox over not appearing before the court, Cox saw this as an additional reason for not continuing in office—though civil service reform was the proximate cause of his resignation.

==Liberal Republican revolt (1870–1872)==
Dissatisfaction over the Grant administration, his appointments of family and friends, corruption at the New York Customs House, and his attempt to annex Santo Domingo, led many reformers to seek new leadership. Grant&#x27;s prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan alienated a fraction of former Republican allies, who believed civil service reform should have priority over civil rights of blacks. In 1870, Senator Carl Schurz of Missouri, a German immigrant, bolted from the regular Republican Party. After Cox resigned office the same year, many reformers believed that Grant was incapable of reforming civil service. Grant, however, had yet not given up on civil service reform and he created the Civil Service Commission, authorized and funded by Congress, whose rules would be effective January 1, 1872. Grant appointed reformer and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; editor George William Curtis to head the commission. Grant appointee Columbus Delano, Grant&#x27;s third cousin and replacement of Cox, however, exempted the Interior Department from the commission&#x27;s rules, later saying the department was too large for compliance.

In March 1871, a disgruntled Cox organized a breakaway nucleus of reforming Republicans in Cincinnati, when 100 Republicans signed a pact, separating themselves from the regular Republican Party, calling themselves Liberal Republicans. Schurz, now considered a Liberal Republican ringleader, advocated full amnesty for former Confederates. The new party demanded &quot;civil service reform, sound money, low tariffs, and state&#x27;s rights.&quot; Meeting on May 1, 1872, at their convention held in Cincinnati, the Liberal Republicans nominated &quot;New York Tribune&quot; editor Horace Greeley for President of the United States. Cox had been mentioned for the presidency, but he was not put on the ballot. Reformers had favored Charles Francis Adams for president and he was put on the ballot, but he could not obtain enough votes to capture the nomination. Cox was against Greeley&#x27;s nomination and withdrew his support for the Liberal Republican revolt. Greeley, in effect, took the campaign from reformers, attacking Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policy, rather than making reform the primary goal. Grant, who was renominated by the regular Republican Party, easily won reelection over Greeley, having captured 56% of the popular vote.

Cox was considered as a U.S. Senate candidate in the 1872 election, but the Ohio legislature selected a more pro-civil rights Republican. At this time U.S. Senators were chosen by state legislatures rather than by popular vote.

==Later years==
===Railroad president and receiver (1873–78)===
In October 1873, Cox was made President and Receiver of the Toledo and Wabash Railroad. Cox moved to Toledo, Ohio, to take charge of the property. He served from 1873 to 1878. 

===U.S. Representative (1877–79) ===
Republican Party candidate Cox was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Toledo in 1876. Cox served a single term in the Forty-Fifth Congress from 1877 to 1879. Cox defeated Democratic Party candidate Frank H. Hurd. Cox received 17,276 votes against Hurd who received 15,361 votes. Cox represented the Sixth District of Ohio that included Fulton, Henry, Lucas, Ottawa, Williams, and Wood counties. Cox declined to run for a second term. 

===Cincinnati Law School dean (1881–97)===
He then returned to Cincinnati, serving as Dean of the Cincinnati Law School from 1881 to 1897. After retiring from his position as dean, he was urged by President William McKinley to accept the position of U.S. ambassador to Spain, but declined, having strong anti-imperialist views

===University of Cincinnati president (1885–89)===
Cox was President of the University of Cincinnati from 1885 to 1889.

===Military historian and author===
During his later years, Cox was a prolific author. His works include &quot;Atlanta&quot; (published in 1882); &quot;The March to the Sea: Franklin and Nashville&quot; (1882); &quot;The Second Battle of Bull Run&quot; (1882); &quot;The Battle of Franklin, Tennessee&quot; (1897); and &quot;Military Reminiscences of the Civil War&quot; (1900). His books are still cited by scholars, and his memoirs contain incisive analyses of military practice and events.

==Death and burial==
Cox died on summer vacation at Gloucester, Massachusetts. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati.

==Historical reputation==
With the exception of dissertations and a few biographical articles, there were no 20th-century book biographies of Cox&#x27;s entire life. In 1901, historian William Cox Cochran authored a 35-page book titled &quot;General Jacob Dolson Cox: Early Life and Military Services&quot; published by Bibliotheca Sacra Company in Oberlin, Ohio. &quot;The Biographical Dictionary of America&quot; published in 1906 by the American Biographical Society, edited by Rossiter Johnson, had a biographical article on Cox, that included a sketch portrait of Cox. Volume 4 of &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot;, edited by Dumas Malone, published in 1930 by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, has a biographical article on Cox, authored by Homer Carey Hockett (H.C.H.). In 2014, historian Eugene D. Schmiel authored &quot;Citizen-General: Jacob Dolson Cox and the Civil War Era&quot; book biography on Cox&#x27;s entire life.

According to historian Donald K. Pickens, Cox &quot;was a fascinating figure, very much part of his time, yet his various interests and achievements set him apart from his contemporaries.&quot; Pickens said Cox was an effective Secretary of Interior, &quot;following Grant&#x27;s policy of eventual assimilation of American Indians.&quot; Cox&#x27;s endorsement of civil service reform was in opposition to powerful Republican Senators. Historian Ron Chernow said Cox was a conservative on Grant&#x27;s cabinet, preaching against black suffrage and favored racial segregation, but &quot;he enjoyed a reputation of an efficient administrator and an energetic ally of civil service reform.&quot; Historian Eugene D. Schmiel said Cox, as Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Interior, &quot;implemented one of the most far-reaching attempts to reform Indian Policy and instituted the federal government&#x27;s first extensive civil service reform.&quot; Schmiel said &quot;knowledge of Cox the citizen-general is limited, and he remains a relative unknown except to specialists and buffs.&quot; Concerning Cox&#x27;s published military works, historian H.C.H. said that Cox, in general, was &quot;recognized as an elegant and forceful writer, of fine critical ability and impartial judgement, one of the foremost military historians of the country.&quot; 

Built in 1880, Cox&#x27;s home in Cincinnati is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cox Administration Building (designed by Cass Gilbert) at Oberlin College is named in his honor.

==Microscopy studies (1873–1895)==
Around 1873, Cox became interested the study of microscopy and took it up as a recreational hobby. Cox&#x27;s first studies were on fresh water forms, including rotatoria and diatomaceae. Cox displayed painstaking thoroughness and logical analysis in his microscopical studies, keeping notes of his work and observations. In 1874, Cox took up the study of photo-micrography, and in 1875 he began making a series of photo-micrographs of diatomaceae, that totaled several hundred in number. 
 In 1881, Cox was elected fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society. Cox gave up microscopical study in 1895, believing it damaged his eyes, but his interest in microscopy remained lifelong.

==Early life==
Richter was born on January 29, 1980, in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; Montgomery, an actress, and Gregory Lynn Richter, who was in the U.S. Navy. At the age of 3, he and his family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where a Japanese casting agency discovered him and signed him up for three TV spots. In 1989, his family moved back to the mainland, settling in San Diego, California.

<doc id="700186" wikidata="Q880693" url="?curid=700186" title="Charles Anderson (governor)">
<text>Charles Anderson (June 1, 1814 – September 2, 1895) was first a Whig and later a Republican politician from Ohio. He served briefly as the 27th governor of Ohio.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Retreat,&quot; Louisville, Kentucky, son of Richard Clough Anderson and Elizabeth (Clark) Anderson, sister of George Rogers Clark and William Clark the famous explorer. Anderson graduated from Miami University in 1833, studied law and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1843. He moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he began a law practice and was later elected county prosecutor.

==Career==
In 1844, Anderson was elected to the Ohio Senate and made a name for himself as an advocate for black rights. He then moved to Texas for health reasons. He gave an impassioned speech in San Antonio in December 1860, strongly opposing secession and calling for the &quot;perpetuity of the national Union.&quot; Angry local pro-Confederates threatened Anderson and arrested him without charge, but Anderson escaped and returned with his family to Dayton.

President Abraham Lincoln sent Anderson on a pro-Union speaking tour of Europe, after which Anderson accepted command of the 93rd Ohio Infantry and was commissioned in the Union Army as a colonel. Badly wounded in battle in Tennessee at the Battle of Stones River, Anderson resigned his commission and returned to Ohio to recuperate.

Anderson was elected the seventh lieutenant governor of Ohio in late 1863 and took office the following year. On August 29, 1865, he became governor upon the death of Governor John Brough.

Anderson served less than five months, until January 8, 1866. Ohio historian Dwight L. Smith wrote that his brief term in office was &quot;uneventful... [and] the services he performed were merely routine.&quot;

==Death==
After leaving the governorship, Anderson resumed his legal practice and moved back to Kentucky, where he died at the age of 81.

Anderson is interred at Kuttawa Cemetery in Kuttawa, Kentucky.

==Family life==
Anderson was born to a prominent family, his father, Richard Clough Anderson Sr., was an aide to the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolution. 

Charles Anderson&#x27;s brother, Major General Robert Anderson, was also a United States Army officer, notable for his defense of Fort Sumter at the outset of the American Civil War. Another brother, William Marshall Anderson, was a noted explorer, politician, and briefly a member of the New Virginia Colony of ex-Confederates in Mexico during the reign of Emperor Maximilian. (Note: Rev. William C. Anderson, who served as president of Miami University from 1849 to 1854, is sometimes erroneously cited as an Anderson brother.)

<text>A briquette (; also spelled briquet) is a compressed block of coal dust or other combustible biomass material (e.g. charcoal, sawdust, wood chips, peat, or paper) used for fuel and kindling to start a fire. The term is a diminutive derived from the French word &quot;brique&quot;, meaning brick.

== Coal briquettes ==

Coal briquettes have long been produced as a means of using up &#x27;small coal&#x27;, the finely broken coal inevitably produced during the mining process. Otherwise this is difficult to burn as it is hard to arrange adequate airflow through a fire of these small pieces; also such fuel tends to be drawn up and out of the chimney by the draught, giving visible black smoke.

The first briquettes were known as culm bombs and were hand-moulded with a little wet clay as a binder. These could be difficult to burn efficiently, as the unburned clay produced a large ash content, blocking airflow through a grate.

With Victorian developments in engineering, particularly the hydraulic press, it became possible to produce machine-made briquettes with minimal binder content. A tar or pitch binder was used, obtained first from gas making and later from petrochemical sources. These binders burned away completely, making it a low-ash fuel. A proprietary brand of briquettes from the South Wales coalfield was Phurnacite, developed by Idris Jones for Powell Duffryn. These were intended to emulate a high-quality anthracite coal, such as that from the Cynheidre measures. This involved blending a mixture of coals from different grades and colliery sources. Phurnacite used the following mix:
* Bituminous coal, 25%
* Steam coal, 45%
* Dry steam coal, 22%
* Pitch, 8%

Early briquettes were large and brick-shaped. Phurnacite briquettes later adopted a squared oval shape. This regular shape packed well as a good firebed, with plentiful airflow. They are also easy to mechanically feed, allowing the development of automatically controlled heating boilers that could run for days without human intervention.
== Charcoal briquettes ==

Charcoal briquettes sold for cooking food can include:
* Wood charcoal (fuel)
* Lignite coal (fuel) 
* Anthracite coal (fuel)
* Limestone (ash colourant)
* Starch (binder)
* Borax (release agent)
* Sodium nitrate (accelerant)
* Sawdust
* Wax (some brands: binder, accelerant, ignition facilitator).
* Chaff (rice chaff and peanut chaff)

As a rule of thumb, a charcoal briquette will heat a camping Dutch oven by approximately , so 20 charcoal briquettes will heat it by .

== East-Asian briquettes ==

Home made charcoal briquettes (called &#x27;) were found after charcoal production in Japanese history. In the Edo period, polysaccharide extracted from red algae was widely used as a binder. After the imports of steam engines in the Meiji period, coal and clay became major ingredients of Japanese briquettes. These briquettes, &#x27; and &#x27;, were exported to China and Korea. Today, coal briquettes are avoided for their sulfur oxide emission. Charcoal briquettes are still used for traditional or outdoor cooking. Woody flakes such as sawdust or coffee dust are major ingredients of modern mass-consumed briquettes (e.g., &#x27;).

===Use in China===

Throughout China, cylindrical briquettes, called &quot;fēng wō méi&quot; (beehive coal 蜂窩煤 / 蜂窝煤) or &quot;Mei&quot; (coal 煤) or &quot;liàn tàn&quot; (kneaded coal 練炭 / 练炭), are used in purpose-built cookers.

The origin of &quot;Mei&quot; is &quot;Rentan&quot; (kneaded coal 練炭) of Japan. &quot;Rentan&quot; was invented in Japan in the 19th century, and spread to Manchukuo, Korea and China in the first half of the 20th century. There were many &quot;Rentan&quot; factories in Manchukuo and Pyongyang. Although &quot;Rentan&quot; went out of use in Japan after the 1970s, it is still popular in China and Vietnam (&quot;than tổ ong&quot; coal).

The cookers are simple, ceramic vessels with metal exteriors. Two types are made: the single, or triple briquette type, the latter holding the briquettes together side by side. These cookers can accommodate a double stack of cylinders. A small fire of tinder is started, upon which the cylinder(s) is placed. When a cylinder is spent, another cylinder is placed on top using special tongs, with the one below igniting it. The fire can be maintained by swapping spent cylinders for fresh ones, and retaining a still-glowing spent cylinder.

Each cylinder lasts for over an hour. These cookers are used to cook, or simmer, pots of tea, eggs, soups, stews, etc.
The cylinders are delivered, usually by cart, to businesses, and are very inexpensive.

==Peat briquettes==

In Ireland, briquettes made from peat, the product of the decomposition of marsh plants in a low-oxygen environment, are a common type of solid fuel, largely replacing sods of raw peat as a domestic fuel. These briquettes consist of shredded peat, compressed to form a virtually smokeless, slow-burning, easily stored and transported fuel. Although often used as the sole fuel for a fire, they are also used to light a coal fire quickly and easily. Peat briquettes are also sometimes used for grilling meats and vegetables as they bring a unique aroma to the food. Bord na Móna is the Irish state owned company in charge of peat, which also handles production of peat briquettes.

==Biomass briquettes==

Biomass briquettes are made from agricultural waste and are a replacement for fossil fuels such as oil or coal, and can be used to heat boilers in manufacturing plants, and also have applications in developing countries. Biomass briquettes are a technically renewable source of energy and their emissions do not constitute an anthropogenic greenhouse gas, unlike emissions from traditional coal briquettes, as any carbon released was taken directly from the atmosphere in recent history, not sequestered deep in the earth during the carboniferous period as with coal.

Although briquetting is an appropriate technology for the production of renewable energy, its widespreadness is limited. Especially due to the high initial investments and energy consumption of a high-pressure briquetting press. However, manual low-pressure briquetting presses (operating pressure &lt;5 MPa) can represent a relevant alternative, regarding to their ease of use and modest energy consumption for the developing countries.

A number of companies in India have switched from furnace oil to biomass briquettes to save costs on boiler fuels. The use of biomass briquettes is predominant in the southern parts of India, where coal and furnace oil are being replaced by biomass briquettes. A number of units in Maharashtra (India) are also using biomass briquettes as boiler fuel. Use of biomass briquettes can earn Carbon Credits for reducing emissions in the atmosphere. Lanxess India and a few other large companies are supposedly using biomass briquettes for earning Carbon Credits by switching their boiler fuel. Biomass briquettes also provide more calorific value/kg and save around 30–40 percent of boiler fuel costs.

A popular biomass briquette emerging in developed countries takes a waste produce such as sawdust, compresses it and then extrudes it to make a reconstituted log that can replace firewood. It is a similar process to forming a wood pellet but on a larger scale. There are no binders involved in this process. The natural lignin in the wood binds the particles of wood together to form a solid. Burning a wood briquette is far more efficient than burning firewood. Moisture content of a briquette can be as low as 4%, whereas green firewood may be as high as 65%.

For example, parameters of fuel briquettes made by extrusion from sawdust in Ukraine:


The extrusion production technology of briquettes is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from . As shown in the table above the quality of such briquets, especially heat content, is much higher comparing with other methods like using piston presses.

Sawdust briquettes have developed over time with two distinct types: those with holes through the centre, and those that are solid. Both types are classified as briquettes but are formed using different techniques. A solid briquette is manufactured using a piston press that compresses sandwiched layers of sawdust together. Briquettes with a hole are produced with a screw press. The hole is from the screw thread passing through the centre, but it also increases the surface area of the log and aids efficient combustion.

==Paper briquettes==
Paper briquettes are the byproduct of a briquettor, which compresses shredded paper material into a small cylindrical form. Briquettors are often sold as add-on systems to existing disintegrator or rotary knife mill shredding systems. The NSA has a maximum particle size regulation for shredded paper material that is passed through a disintegrator or rotary knife mill, which typically does not exceed square. This means that material exiting a disintegrator is the appropriate size for compression into paper briquettes, as opposed to strip-cut shredders which produce long sheets of paper.

After being processed through the disintegrator, paper particles are typically passed through an air system to remove dust and unwanted magnetic materials before being sent into the briquettor. The air system may also be responsible for regulating moisture content in the waste particles, as briquetting works optimally within a certain range of moisture. Studies have shown that the optimal moisture percentage for shredded particles is 18% for paper and 22% for wheat straw.

=== Environmental impact ===
Briquetted paper has many notable benefits, many of which minimize the impact of the paper waste generated by a shredding system. Several manufactures claim up to 90% volume reduction of briquetted paper waste versus traditional shredding. Decreasing the volume of shredded waste allows it to be transported and stored more efficiently, reducing the cost and fuel required in the disposal process.

In addition to the cost savings associated with reducing the volume of waste, paper briquettes are more useful in paper mills to create recycled paper than uncompressed shredded material. Compressed briquettes can also be used as a fuel for starting fires or as an insulating material.

==Safety==
Experts generally warn that charcoal burners are not to be used in enclosed environments to heat homes, due to the obvious danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.

<doc id="700195" wikidata="Q7775585" url="?curid=700195" title="The Women's College, University of Sydney">
<text>The Women&#x27;s College is a residential college within the University of Sydney, in the suburb of Camperdown, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was opened in 1892.

The Women&#x27;s College is one of two all-female residential colleges at The University of Sydney. It accommodates approximately 280 students accepting both under- and post-graduate students. It also has approximately 30 non-resident students (affiliates). The principal, vice-principal and dean of students live on the premises.

The college&#x27;s buildings were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005.

==History==

In 1889 a college for women within the University of Sydney was established and endowed by an Act of the NSW Parliament. This was the culmination of a process that began in 1887 when, six years after the formal admission of women to the University of Sydney &quot;in complete equality with men&quot;, a public meeting was held to discuss the desirability of establishing a residential college for women. Over the course of the next five years, funds were raised enabling the college to open in March 1892 in temporary accommodation in &quot;Strathmore&quot;, a rented house in Glebe. It had four resident and four non-resident (or affiliate) students.
Granted land by the University on the southern edge of campus, the college moved to its own building in May 1894. Designed by the architectural firm of Sulman &amp; Power, the College&#x27;s first permanent home still forms the heart of the present building complex and is heritage listed.

The 1887 meeting resolved that the college not be attached to a religious denomination, and that the Colleges&#x27; Endowment Act of 1854, which provided for the establishment of the denominational men&#x27;s colleges, should be subject to the provision that &quot;no religious catechism or formulary distinctive of any particular denomination&quot; should be taught, nor would any attempt be made to attach students to any particular denomination. The College was to be &quot;undenominational&quot;. The other elements of the college&#x27;s role, envisaged in 1887, were to provide &quot;domestic supervision&quot; and &quot;efficient assistance in preparing for university lectures and examinations&quot;.

These ideals continue to guide the College in the 21st century. The Women&#x27;s College now accommodates 260 women undergraduates and 20 postgraduates. It maintains its tradition of being at the forefront of women&#x27;s education and social theory and championing women&#x27;s rights, academic thought and leadership.

In the 127 years since its foundation in 1892 more than 7,000 students have been members of the College.

== Buildings and campus ==
In 1894 the Main Building opened with accommodation for 26 students. Designed by Sulman &amp; Power it cost £10,056, a substantial amount of money for the time. In 1916 the College expanded, building &quot;The Cottage&quot; for an extra 6 students. To meet the demand for places after the First World War, &quot;The Maples&quot;, a house at the rear of the property was rented and then, in 1919 purchased. Additional student rooms were added in 1924, the back balconies of Main Building closed in, and the Louisa Macdonald Commemoration Dining Hall built.

The next major expansion of College began in 1936, with the construction of the new Williams wing. Named in honour of Susie Jane Williams, the immediate past Principal (1919–1934), it was officially opened by Lady Wakehurst on 6 July 1937, and provided accommodation to 85 students. Further growth in demand after the Second World War led to the building in 1958 of the Reid wing, and further additions to Williams. Designed by Ellice Nosworthy, and supported by a donation given by Mary Reid, it originally provided accommodation for approximately 40 students.

The third major expansion of College took place between 1965 and 1969, with the building of the Langley wing and Menzies Common Room, as well as extensions to the Dining Hall, bringing capacity of College to 280 students. The project was designed by Fowell Mansfield &amp; Maclurcan and funded partially by grants from the Australian Universities Commission. In the mid-1990s the Vere Hole Research Centre and Library was added under the Reid wing, funded by two bequests and a fundraising drive.

In 1999–2000 the Main Building was restored with a grant from the Centenary of Federation Fund.

In 2018 the Sibyl Centre, a purpose-built meeting and conference centre designed by m3architecture, was opened.

== Academic and support programmes ==
Women&#x27;s College operates a range of programmes designed to encourage students to maximise their academic potential.

=== College Tutorials ===
Throughout both semesters the College runs tutorials in more than thirty subjects, spanning the full range of academic disciplines. Most tutors are senior students, postgraduates or University staff with expertise in their fields and proven teaching skills.

=== Academic assistants ===
Academic Assistants are postgraduates and senior undergraduates who mentor first-year students and facilitate a smooth transition from secondary school to tertiary studies.

=== Resident assistants ===
In addition to academic support, the College appoints a dynamic team of Resident Assistants (RAs) each year, who provide pastoral care to all students. RAs are students in their senior years of university and having already negotiated the transition to uni and living away from home, they are well-equipped to help out others. The RAs help staff and House Committee with many events and College initiatives and are a point of contact for all students. They also assist with the safety and security of the College and are on call for emergencies after hours. They work with the Dean of Students to ensure that everyone at College feels at home.

== Admissions ==
The College admits between 70 and 100 students annually, in a competitive admissions process which involves a formal application and interview. The process is rolling throughout the year, and applications are accepted for students wishing to enter first year at the University of Sydney, as well as those in subsequent years of study and at post-graduate level.

In addition to residential places, the College offers affiliate membership to enable students to access its academic and social programmes, but maintain independent living elsewhere. Affiliate applications are accepted throughout the year from women at all stages of their tertiary studies.

The Women&#x27;s College offers a number of scholarships for resident students on the basis of merit and financial need. Scholarships are available to students from government schools, rural areas, Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, post graduate medical students and students aiming to study at the Conservatorium of Music.

The Grace Frazer Award (est. 1892) is an academic entrance prize given to the student or students who enter the College in their first year of tertiary study with the highest ATAR in their College fresher cohort. It was endowed by Marie Florence (Mrs Charles Burton) Fairfax, who was a member of the Ladies&#x27; Committee that raised funds to establish the College and was a member of the College Council from 1891–1893. The scholarship was established in honour of her sister Grace Frazer.

== Philanthropy ==
The College has a strong record of philanthropy. The funds to erect the original Sulman &amp; Power building and to bring the college into being, were raised largely by The Ladies&#x27; Committee, formed immediately following the original 1887 meeting. Its President was Lady Carrington (wife of the Governor) and its Honorary Secretary was Miss Mary Fairfax, and it included many other prominent members of Sydney society. This committee was successful in gathering large and small contributions from 496 subscribers sufficient to meet the conditions of the Endowment Act.

Since that time, philanthropy has been a major source of financial support for every new building and capital works programme. As it receives no funding from government or the University, the College continues to look to its community for support in maintaining and expanding its mission.

The Students&#x27; Club also runs its own philanthropic activities, with a Charity Committee that raises money and supports a variety of causes. Students and alumnae are encouraged to give back to the College through a variety of financial and service activities.

==Student life==
=== House Committee ===
All students living at the Women&#x27;s College are members of the Students&#x27; Club, which gives access to all College activities. The House Committee, a group of nine students, is the organising arm of the Students&#x27; Club, and it is elected by popular vote of the student body.

=== Leadership ===
The House Committee is led by the Senior Student. She occupies the highest-ranking student position in the College. Usually a student in her third or fourth year, is a member of the Women&#x27;s College Council and reports on student activities to Council at its meetings throughout the year. The College values the contribution of its Senior Student very highly. Each year her name is placed on the honour roll in the dining hall. Former Senior Students include the Governor of NSW, Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir A.C., Dr Meg Mulvey, Ms Jane Diplock and Ms Katrina Dawson.

A wide range of other leadership opportunities are available with an extensive range of student committees, as well as structured in-house leadership programmes designed to enhance individual strengths and build on confidence.

Each year Women&#x27;s College students in third year and above are invited to participate in a mentoring program which matches students with mentors from a range of industries sourced from both the Women&#x27;s College Alumnae and contacts external to College. Based on establishing personal contact between the mentor and the mentee, students and mentors are encouraged to meet face to face throughout the year.

=== Senior Common Room ===
The Senior Common Room (SCR) is the group of senior students at College. Membership is extended to all students in fourth year of university and above, and all members have access to the SCR: a secure air-conditioned room with comfortable seating and study facilities, where members often work.

Each year the SCR selects a Senior Representative, who, together with a small social committee and the Senior Research Fellow, co-ordinates the activities of the group and organises a programme of social and academic events.

=== Traditions ===
The College song is &quot;Home of Joy and Knowledge&quot; sung to the tune of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. It continues to be sung regularly by students at sporting, cultural and other occasions.

The Motto &quot;Together&quot; is a quotation from Tennyson&#x27;s The Princess which tells the story of an heroic princess who forswears the world of men and founds a women&#x27;s university where men are forbidden to enter.

The College has a calendar of regular events, including: 
* Orientation Week – to welcome the new students.
* Chancellor&#x27;s Dinner – to award academic prizes.
* Formal Dinner – a weekly gathering of the whole College in academic attire with a speaker.

<text>John Brough (; rhymes with &quot;huff&quot;) (September 17, 1811 – August 29, 1865) was a War Democrat politician from Ohio. He served as the 26th governor of Ohio during the final years of the American Civil War, dying in office of gangrene shortly after the war concluded.

==Early life and career==

Born in Marietta, Ohio, to an English immigrant and a Pennsylvania-born mother, Brough was orphaned at the age of 11. To support himself, he became a printer&#x27;s apprentice, and later received three years of part-time education at Ohio University, where he worked part-time as a reporter for the &quot;Athens Mirror&quot;. He rose to become a newspaper publisher in Marietta and then in Lancaster, where he and his brother Charles purchased the &quot;Ohio Eagle&quot;, a paper that espoused the views of the Democratic Party.

Brough served two years as Clerk of the Ohio Senate (where he also served as the capital correspondent for his newspaper, as well as the &quot;Ohio Statesman&quot;). He was elected as a Democrat to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1837, representing the Fairfield-Hocking district, and served from 1838 to 1839, chairing the Committee on Banks and Currency. He then took office as State Auditor, serving until 1845, when the Whigs swept most of the state&#x27;s Democrats out of office in the Election of 1844.

He was a trustee of Ohio University from 1840 to 1843.

In 1841, he and his brother bought the &quot;Cincinnati Advertiser&quot; and renamed it the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. Brough then moved to Indiana, where he entered the railroad business and became President of the Madison and Indianapolis Railway in 1848. He later presided over the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railway.

In Madison, Indiana, he was remembered for leading the railroad through a period in which it made Madison the leading pork packing city in the nation, but the line then fell prey to competition. His attempt to combat competing lines was the construction of two tunnels as part of an effort to avoid a steep incline at Madison. The company spent more than $300,000 (~$ in ) on construction during two years, before the effort was stopped in 1855. The project was known locally as &quot;Brough&#x27;s Folly&quot; and he left in 1853 when the Madison line underwent a short-lived merger with another railroad company.

Brough was a very large and corpulent man, as well as being a hard worker. The railroad company named one of its engines &quot;John Brough&quot; in his honor When it arrived in Madison on May 10, 1850, the &quot;Madison Courier&quot; of May 11 made the following comment that was printed in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; of June 1, 1850. &quot;We are told this engine is called the John Brough on account of its great weight and for the great amount of business it is capable of doing.&quot;

==Governor of Ohio==

Ohio Republicans and War Democrats dissatisfied with the leadership of Ohio Gov. David Tod turned to Brough after he made a strongly pro-Union speech in his hometown of Marietta on June 10, 1863. He was elected to the governorship that fall on a pro-Union ticket, partly due to his stronger support than Tod of the anti-slavery direction that the Northern war effort was taking. Having been elected as a representative of the Union Party, Brough is the last Ohio governor to date who was neither a Democrat nor a Republican. Brough also defeated Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham. This prompted President Abraham Lincoln to wire Brough, &quot;Glory to God in the Highest. Ohio has saved the Nation.&quot;

Brough took office in January 1864. Ohio historian Walter Havighurst described Brough as being &quot;a big bull of a man with driving energy,&quot; and Richard H. Abbott wrote that he &quot;had a reputation for rough and ready politics with a temperament to match... [he was] a blunt, outspoken, rude man who loved to chew tobacco [and thus] presented quite a contrast with his two handsome and dignified predecessors, William Dennison and David Tod.&quot;

As governor, Brough strongly supported the Lincoln Administration&#x27;s war efforts and was key to persuading other Midwestern governors to raise 100-day regiments in early 1864 to release more seasoned troops for duty in Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s spring campaign. Ohio contributed more than 34,000 troops, and was the only one of the five participating states (the others were Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin) to exceed its quota. Brough supported Lincoln&#x27;s reelection in 1864, despite the machinations of Ohio&#x27;s favorite son Salmon P. Chase, and worked tirelessly to support the state&#x27;s soldiers in the field. When Chase resigned as Secretary of the Treasury, Brough was offered the position but declined it to remain as governor.

With the conclusion of the war in 1865, the pro-Union alliance between Ohio&#x27;s Republicans and War Democrats dissolved, and the now-dominant Republicans looked elsewhere for a candidate. On June 15, Brough announced that he would not seek the gubernatorial nomination again but would not decline it if offered; it was not. Later that summer, Brough stumbled in the State House yard, bruising his hand and badly spraining his ankle. Using a cane caused inflammation over time and gangrene eventually set in.
Abbott wrote that Brough &quot;had given his full efforts to serving his state... [and did so] with energy and ability.&quot; Historian Richard C. Knopf wrote, &quot;Whatever may be said of Brough&#x27;s partisanship and his lack of personal dignity, one must assess in his favor the qualities of integrity, perseverance, and public spiritedness.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Brough was twice married and had seven children. In 1832, Brough married Achsah P. Pruden of Athens. She had two children. She died September 8, 1838 at Lancaster. Brough married Caroline A. Nelson, of Columbus, at Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1843. She had five children. 

John Brough died in office on August 29, 1865, 19 days short of his 54th birthday. He was buried at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland.

Brough is honored with a full-size bronze depiction inside the Cuyahoga County Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Cleveland, Ohio for his service as governor during the Civil War.
