<text>Marcel Dadi (; 20 August 1951 – 17 July 1996) was a Tunisian-born French virtuoso guitarist known for his finger-picking style which faithfully recreated the instrumental styles of American guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Merle Travis and Jerry Reed. He became a friend of country star Chet Atkins.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Marcel Dadi was born in Sousse, Tunisia on 20 August 1951. Dadi, along with his immediate family, moved to Paris, France in 1954. In 1961, he started playing guitar at age 10. He had joined Andre Assouline, Joseph Illouz, and Maurice Levy to form a rock instrumental band by 1964. He was inspired by the music of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, He continued to expand his musical horizons with the influence of a guitarist, Bernard Photzer, who introduced him to the music of Elvis Presley and other 1950&#x27;s rockers. Photzer also taught him the rudiments of flatpicking. As a soloist with French singer-songwriter and guitarist, Hugues Aufray, Dadi began to develop his own approach to flatpicking. From 1972, he wrote instructional articles for Folk Music Review, wherein he introduced his rigorous training method, which utilizes a fingering chart, in the March 1972 issue.

===Career===
Dadi released several LPs and some instructional videos before his early death. His recordings featured a mix of compositions by his American heroes and original compositions of his own in a similar style. A feature of his early LPs was that they included a tablature booklet, allowing guitarists to learn the tunes for themselves. Dadi often recorded tunes dedicated to his friends, such as &quot;Roger Chesterfield,&quot; dedicated to Roger C. Field with whom he first went to Nashville in 1975 to visit Chet Atkins.

Marcel Dadi immigrated to Eilat (Israel) on the Red Sea, in 1983, and lived there with his wife and young son for several years before moving back to France. In 1988, Eric Clapton, his longtime family friend, came to Eilat to visit Marcel Dadi.

==Death==
On 17 July 1996, en route from New York City to Paris with his band and his long time friend Serge Sloimovits, Marcel Dadi died when the Boeing 747-131 operating TWA Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island. He was returning from the United States to France after being honored at Nashville&#x27;s Country Music Hall of Fame.

Marcel Dadi&#x27;s body was recovered, as were those of all of the other victims. He is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Israel.

== Certified Guitar Player ==
Marcel Dadi was honoured as one of the five &quot;Certified Guitar Players&quot; by Chet Atkins.

<text>Berlin German, or Berlinese (, , or ; derogative: , ), is the regiolect spoken in the city of Berlin as well as its surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgisch dialect. However, several phrases in Berlin German are typical of and unique to the city, indicating the manifold origins of immigrants, such as the Huguenots from France.

==Overview==
The area of Berlin was one of the first to abandon East Low German as a written language, which occurred in the 16th century, and later also as a spoken language. That was the first regiolect of Standard German with definite High German roots but a Low German substratum apparently formed (&quot;Berlinerisch&quot; may therefore be considered an early form of &quot;Missingsch&quot;). Only recently has the new dialect expanded into the surroundings, which had used East Low German.

Since the 20th century, the Berlin dialect has been a colloquial standard in the surrounding Brandenburg region. However, in Berlin proper, especially in the former West Berlin, the dialect is now seen more as a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak Standard German in everyday life.

Occasionally, the regiolect is found on advertising.
== History ==
The area now known as Berlin was originally settled by Germanic tribes, who may have given their name to the Havel River in West Berlin. The area was later inhabited by immigrant Slavs, as evidenced by place and field names such as Kladow, Buckow and Köpenick, and by the Berlin word Kietz, ‘city neighborhood.’

The city of Berlin lies south of the Benrath Line and has been influenced by Low and Central German since its first documented mention in 1237. From 1300-1500, immigration from the Flemish areas of the Holy Roman Empire the East Low German spoken in Berlin underwent a number of changes but was eventually abandoned as a colloquial language. This resulted in a separate variety of Standard High German with a clear Middle German basis but a strong Low German substrate. Only recently has this new dialect spread to the surrounding area, which had previously remained East Low German. Berlin German has parallels to Colognian (&quot;Kölsch&quot;), which also has strong features of a regiolect and has been shaped by immigration over the centuries. Both exhibit the characteristic softening of initial sounds, such as in &quot;jut&quot; (&quot;gut,&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;) and &quot;jehen&quot; (&quot;gehen,&quot; &#x27;to go&#x27;).

In the late 18th century, the common colloquial Brandenburg (or Markish) dialect, was replaced by a Central German koiné based on Upper Saxon. This is similar to developments in other Low German regions, which first developed Missingsch dialects as a mixed language with the law firm language and changed their use to colloquial language. The newly created koiné dialect, which was very similar to modern Berlin German, adopted individual words (&quot;ick, det, wat, doof&quot;) from the neighboring Low German-speaking areas.

Berlin was a destination for ever increasing immigration starting in 1871. Large numbers of immigrants from Saxony and Siliesia pushed back against some of the Low German elements of the Berlin dialect. The 1900s saw large waves of emigration out of Berlin and into West Germany, the first starting in1945 and the second in 1961.  

=== Dialect ===
Due to the extensive commonalities with High German, Berlin German is classified as a dialect of German. Berlinish has long been looked down upon as a dialect of &quot;the common people,&quot; and the educated class has historically distanced themselves through use of the High German dialect, which is considered the standard.

Berliners use written conventions of High German, but there does exist a Brandenburg-Berlin dictionary which includes vocabulary specific to the Berlin dialect. When recording Berlinish speech in writing, there is no consensus on transcription. Pronunciation varies among speakers and individual speakers may alter their pronunciation depending on communicative context. For published texts, each publisher determines its own transcription system for embedded passages of Berlin German within texts. The majority use High German orthography, only changing letters or words to mark prominent differences in pronunciation.

=== Present Day ===
Berlin German is the central language variety of a regiolect area extending across Berlin, Brandenburg, and parts of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt. In Brandenburg, Berlin German has been considered the colloquial variety since the 20th century, but In Berlin itself, especially in West Berlin, an influx of people with educated middle-class dialects has resulted in Berlin German becoming one of many dialects in the region, no longer a regiolect but a sociolect.

==Phonology==
Berliner pronunciation is similar to that of other High German varieties. Nevertheless, it maintains unique characteristics, which set it apart from other variants. The most notable are the strong contraction trends over several words and the rather irreverent adaptation of foreign words and anglicisms that are difficult to understand for many speakers of Upper German. Also, some words contain the letter j (representing IPA: [j]) instead of g, as is exemplified in the word for &quot;good&quot;, in which &quot;gut&quot; becomes &quot;jut&quot;.

=== &#x27;j&#x27; in place of &#x27;g&#x27; ===
Word initially and after front vowels and approximants, &#x27;g&#x27; is realized as the voiced palatal approximant [j]. After back vowels, the sound is pronounced as a voiced velar fricative [ɣ], the same sound as High German &#x27;r.&#x27;

=== Monophthongs ===
Many diphthongs are realized as long monophthongs in Berlin German: au [au] to oo [o:], ei [aɪ] to ee [e:]. However, this pattern holds only for words with a historic au/oo or ei/ee split between the Middle High German and Low German dialects. For example, &quot;ein/een&quot; (&quot;a/an&quot;) and &quot;Rauch/Rooch&quot; (&quot;smoke&quot;) conform to the split, but &quot;Eis&quot; (&quot;ice&quot;) and &quot;Haus&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) do not.

=== High German Consonant Shift ===
As a Central German dialect bordering Low German regions, Berlin German does not exhibit all features of the High German consonant shift, retaining some older features, such as geminate &#x27;p&#x27; [pp], as in &quot;Appel&quot; and &quot;Kopp&quot; for High German &quot;Apfel&quot; and &quot;Kopf&quot;, as well as &quot;det/dit&quot;, &quot;wat,&quot; and &quot;et&quot; for &quot;das,&quot; &quot;was,&quot; and &quot;es,&quot; respectively.

=== Reductions and Contractions ===
Berlin dialect speakers often reduce and contract words that are separated in High German. For example, High German &quot;auf dem&quot; becomes Berlin German &quot;uffm&quot;.

==Grammar==
Berlinese grammar contains some notable differences from that of Standard German. For instance, the accusative case and dative case are not distinguished. Similarly, conjunctions that are distinguished in standard German are not in Berlinese. For example, in Standard German, &quot;wenn&quot; (when, if) is used for conditional, theoretical or consistent events, and &quot;wann&quot; (when) is used for events that are currently occurring or for questions. There is no difference between the two in Berlinese.

Genitive forms are also replaced by prepositional accusative forms, some still with an inserted pronoun: &quot;dem sein Haus&quot; (this one his house) rather than the standard &quot;sein Haus&quot; (his house). Plural forms often have an additional -s, regardless of the standard plural ending.

Words ending in &quot;-ken&quot; are often written colloquially and pronounced as &quot;-sken&quot;.

===Pronouns===

==== Personal Pronouns ====
The accusative and dative case pronouns are almost identical in Berlin German. While in High German the first-person singular accusative is &quot;mich&quot;, and the first-person singular dative is &quot;mir&quot;, Berlin German uses &quot;mir&quot; for both cases. A popular saying is &quot;Der Berlina sacht imma mir, ooch wenn et richtich is&quot; (&quot;The Berliner always says &quot;mir&quot;, even if it is right.&quot;). In contrast, speakers in southern Brandenburg, use the pronoun &quot;mich&quot; in both cases, as in &quot;Bringt mich mal die Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Bring me the newspaper.&quot;).

The lack of distinction between these pronouns may be attributed to the influence of Brandenburg Low German, in which both &quot;mir&quot; and &quot;mich&quot; sound like &quot;mi&quot; [mi] or &quot;mai&quot; [maɪ]&quot;.&quot; Second-person singular familiar pronouns &quot;dir&quot; (dative) and &quot;dich&quot; (accusative) follow the same pattern, sounding like &quot;di&quot; [di] or &quot;dai&quot; [daɪ].

Berlin German uses &quot;ick&quot; or &quot;icke&quot; for first-person singular subject pronoun &quot;ich&quot;, as shown in the old Berlin saying, &quot;Icke, dette, kieke mal, Oogn, Fleesch und Beene, wenn de mir nich lieben tust, lieb ick mir alleene&quot;. The high German equivalent is &quot;Ich, das, schau mal, Augen, Fleisch und Beine, wenn du mich nicht liebst, liebe ich mich alleine&quot;. (&quot;I, that, just look, eyes, flesh, and legs, if you don&#x27;t love me, I love me alone.&quot;)

Personal pronouns:
Interrogative pronoun:


&quot;Er/Wir&quot; for Direct Address

&quot;Er&quot; (&#x27;he&#x27;) as a form of direct address was previously widespread among German speakers when speaking to subordinates and those of lower social rank. In modern Berlin German, &quot;er&quot; may be used for direct address, as in &quot;Hatter denn ooch’n jült’jen Fahrausweis?&quot; (&quot;Hat er denn auch einen gültigen Fahrausweis?&quot;or &quot;Does he [=do you] also have a valid ticket?&quot; ). This can also be see with the feminine &quot;sie&quot; (she), as in &quot;Hattse denn die fümf&quot; &quot;Euro nich’n bisken kleena?&quot; (&quot;Hat sie denn die fünf Euro nicht ein bisschen kleiner? or “Doesn&#x27;t she [=don&#x27;t you] have something smaller than five Euros?&quot;) .

The third-person plural nominative &quot;wir&quot; is also sometimes used for second-person address in Berlin German. &quot;&quot;Na, hamwa nu det richt’je Bier jewählt?&quot; (&quot;Na, haben wir nun das richtige Bier gewählt?&quot; or &quot;Well, have we now selected the right beer?&quot;)

== Idioms ==
The Berlin regiolect has a number of distinctive idioms, including the following:

* JWD &quot;(janz weit draußen)&quot; = Really far out there
* Na Mann, du hast heut’ aba wieda ’ne Kodderschnauze (Literally: &quot;Well, man, you have a bit of a dirty snout today.&quot;) This expression means the addressee has a loose tongue, giving their unsolicited comments.
* bis in die Puppen (Literally: &quot;until in the dolls&quot;) This expression, meaning &quot;until the wee hours&quot; originated in the 18th century. The Berlin park Großer Tiergarten had a square decorated with statues called “The Dolls.” If you strolled particularly far on Sundays, you walked “until you were in the dolls.”
* Da kamma nich meckan. &quot;You can&#x27;t complain about that.&quot; This is supposedly the highest praise a Berliner can offer.

<text>Bei Dao (, born August 2, 1949) is the pen name of the Chinese-American writer Zhao Zhenkai (). Among the most acclaimed Chinese-language poets of his generation, he is often regarded as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. In addition to poetry, he is the author of short fiction, essays, and a memoir. Known as a dissident, he is a prominent representative of a school of poetry known variously in the West as &quot;Misty&quot; or &quot;Obscure&quot; Poetry.

Born in Beijing before the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Bei Dao served as a member of the Red Guards in his youth. However, disillusioned by the Cultural Revolution, he participated in the 1976 Tiananmen Incident and co-founded an influential literary journal, called &quot;Jintian&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;), that came to be officially banned in China. After his poetry and activism were an inspiration to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Bei Dao was banned from China and entered a period of exile in the West, living and teaching in numerous countries before settling in the United States. He has been allowed to return to mainland China since 2006, but has not done so except for brief visits. In 2007, he joined the faculty of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2009, he became an American citizen.

Bei Dao has been described as having played a significant role in creating a new form of poetry in Chinese literature, one that is often viewed as a reaction to the artistic strictures of the Mao era. In particular, his poetry is known for linguistic experimentation and an embrace of complexity, even paradox, in its exploration of individuality.

Currently, Bei Dao resides in Hong Kong, where he is an Honorary Professor of Humanities at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

==Biography==

=== Family and early life ===
Bei Dao was born in Beijing, China, on August 2, 1949. He is the eldest of three children of Zhao Jinian (d. 2003), an insurance executive, and Zhao Mei Li (née Sun), a medical doctor.

Bei Dao was born into a notable family. On his father&#x27;s side, he traces his lineage to the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, when his ancestor, Zhao Bingyan, was the provincial governor of Hunan and deputy minister of justice. During the Taiping Rebellion, his great-great grandfather, Zhao Jingxian, gained fame for defending the city of Huzhou against a rebel siege for more than two years. When the Xianfeng Emperor was informed of his death, he issued an imperial decree of praise, ordered reparations paid to the family, established an ancestral hall for the family in Huzhou, and recorded Zhao Jingxian&#x27;s life in the Official Archive of National History. Bei Dao&#x27;s great-grandfather was director of the Guangdong Manufacturing Bureau and retired as director of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. However, due to war and internal strife in China, the family&#x27;s fortune declined, and his paternal grandfather earned a modest living selling paintings and scrolls before dying when Bei Dao&#x27;s father was still a child.

While his father&#x27;s side of the family had been defenders and beneficiaries of the Qing Dynasty, Bei Dao&#x27;s maternal side of the family played a role in overthrowing the empire. His maternal grandfather, Sun Haixia, was a member of the Tongmenghui society founded by Sun Yat-sen, who eventually became provisional president of post-imperial China. During the Wuchang Uprising, Sun Haixia was hailed as a hero for seizing a key telegraph station. In addition to founding a secondary school in Hubei, he later served as director of the telecommunications bureau of Chengdu and then directed the telecommunications bureau of Shanghai. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, one of Bei Dao&#x27;s maternal aunts was personal nurse to Mao Zedong&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing. Among his uncles, one was a deputy mayor of Wuhan, and another was vice chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, one of eight political parties officially permitted in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Bei Dao&#x27;s father was self-educated and passed a test to gain employment at a bank. He was later a co-founder of the People&#x27;s Insurance Company of China and a deputy secretary for propaganda for the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), a political party. Bei Dao&#x27;s parents married in Shanghai and settled in Beijing the year before the poet&#x27;s birth. They lived in the city&#x27;s Xicheng District, which borders the Forbidden City and has been known as a home to the middle and upper classes. Bei Dao grew up on Sanbulao (&quot;Three Never Old&quot;) Hutong, a street named for its most famous resident, Admiral Zheng He.

Despite his parents&#x27; professional status, Bei Dao did not have a carefree upbringing. Due to the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; policies of Mao Zedong, which shifted resources toward securing a socialist society, Bei Dao&#x27;s father was assigned to manage academic affairs for the newly established Central Institute of Socialism and the family experienced the hardships of the Great Chinese Famine. Writing in his memoir, &quot;City Gate, Open Up&quot;, Bei Dao describes his memory of that period:Hunger gradually devoured our lives. Dropsy became commonplace. Everyone&#x27;s usual greeting to each other changed from &quot;Have you eaten yet&quot; to &quot;Have you gotten dropsy yet,&quot; then the pant legs were pulled up and each used their fingers to test the other&#x27;s degree of illness.Like many Chinese youth, Bei Dao joined the Young Pioneers of China. He attended Beijing Middle School No. 13, where his teachers praised his writing. He then tested into the elite Beijing No. 4 High School. However, he was unable to graduate: in 1966, when Bei Dao was sixteen, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, which closed the school. (In 2011, upon receiving an honorary doctorate from Brown University, Bei Dao remarked that it was the first degree he had ever received.)

=== Cultural Revolution ===

Having not been selected for induction into the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, Bei Dao spent the first two years of the Cultural Revolution immersed in political activities as a member of a Red Guard faction based at his high school. Initially, he created posters denouncing his former teachers. He led a group of teenagers in publicly shaming a neighbor, forcibly shaving the man&#x27;s head in the street and briefly imprisoning him. He moved into a dormitory at his high school, which became a hub for revolutionary activity, hosting various committees and &quot;struggle sessions&quot;. The students there formed a commune composed of two Red Guard factions dedicated to promoting the ideals of the revolution, for which Bei Dao assisted in disseminating propaganda. On a regional tour in 1966, he and his fellow Red Guard members helped bring an end to a siege of the Anting train station by anti-Maoist protestors, an incident that gave rise to the Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune. Later, during the &quot;Down to the Countryside&quot; movement, he joined delegations to observe education efforts outside Beijing.

In 1967, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officially disavowed the Red Guards due to their frequently violent tactics and disruptive effect on the national economy, and by the following year had largely succeeded in dismantling the movement. Bei Dao, like many former Red Guard members, was assigned to &quot;re-education through labor&quot;. Beginning in 1969, he spent the remainder of the Cultural Revolution as a member of a construction crew outside of Beijing. As a result of this experience, during which he lived among the poor, he came to reject Maoist policies and communist propaganda.

By the early 1970s, Bei Dao began to focus on writing. His early poems drew praise from the acclaimed poet Bing Xin, to whom Bei Dao&#x27;s father reported at the CAPD. During visits to Beijing, his home became a gathering place for friends and aspiring artists. These meetings were monitored by the neighborhood political committee, and on one occasion police raided the home of one member of the group. To avoid drawing attention, Bei Dao wrote alone in his kitchen late at night. In 1974, he composed the first draft of his novella, &quot;Waves,&quot; in a darkroom under the guise that he was developing photographs.

Overall, the Cultural Revolution was a tumultuous period for Bei Dao and his family. Like him, his siblings were sent away on &quot;re-education through labor&quot; assignments. His parents were sent to May Seventh Cadre School to undergo &quot;ideological thought reform&quot;; accused of living a bourgeois lifestyle (for, among other things, employing a nanny) they faced isolation, interrogation, and hard labor. The family was thus separated for much of the decade that Cultural Revolution policies were in force. In 1968, Bei Dao&#x27;s aunt committed suicide after she became the focus of a government investigation. In July 1976, his sister died while attempting to rescue a drowning person. In his memoir, Bei Dao writes, &quot;At this pivotal point in my life, I tried to reassess the past and peer into the future, but everything seemed fuzzy, indiscernible, my heart empty, vacuous&quot;.

=== 1976 Tiananmen Incident and aftermath ===

A watershed event occurred in April 1976, when the government&#x27;s attempt to minimize public mourning for the death of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai led to protests in Tiananmen Square—the first significant anti-government protests since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Bei Dao participated in the demonstrations, which were violently suppressed. Inspired by his experience, he wrote what became his most famous poem, &quot;The Answer,&quot; which has been compared to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; for its impact on a generation of Chinese. Written with defiant language, and extolling human agency, the poem has been described as a refusal of restrictions like those adopted during the Cultural Revolution.

After the death of Mao and the arrest of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; in the latter half of 1976, the Cultural Revolution came to an end, ushering in a relaxation of government control of speech. Bei Dao and his friend, the poet Mang Ke, assembled the literary journal &quot;Jintian (Today)&quot;, working with mimeographs. The first issue appeared in 1978 and was distributed by hand or posted, as broadsides, on what came to be known as Beijing&#x27;s &quot;Democracy Wall&quot;. It featured Bei Dao&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Answer,&quot; as well as a short story he wrote. To avoid governmental scrutiny, he published under a pseudonym, Bei Dao, &quot;Northern Island,&quot; chosen by his friend Mang Ke because Bei Dao hailed from the north of China and preferred solitude. The journal was notable for its literary quality: in its pages, readers were introduced to a group of poets—including Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, Yang Lian, and Shu Ting, among others—whom Chinese critics dubbed &quot;menglong&quot;, which has been translated in English as &quot;misty&quot; or &quot;obscure&quot;, in reference to their embrace of complexity and rejection of the Maoist principles of socialist realism. &quot;The Answer,&quot; in particular, spread through the Chinese underground and vaulted Bei Dao to national fame.

Bei Dao continued to publish poetry and short fiction in &quot;Jintian&quot;, which appeared irregularly until Chinese authorities banned it in 1980. In the same year, he married the artist Shao Fei and moved out of his childhood home. He also transitioned away from employment in construction after eleven years—five years as a concrete mixer and six as an ironworker. He found work as a journalist, writing for the magazine &quot;China Report&quot;. He also translated Western poets into Chinese.

Bei Dao&#x27;s poetry appeared in the officially approved Chinese journal &quot;Shi Kan&quot; (&quot;Poetry Monthly&quot;) during the &quot;Democracy Wall&quot; era of 1978-1980. His poems first appeared in English translation in 1983, when they were featured in the journal &quot;Renditions&quot;, published by the Chinese University Press. In the same year, a collection of his poems was published as &quot;Notes from the City of the Sun&quot; by the Cornell University East Asia Program as part of its &quot;East Asia Papers&quot; series. The following year, his poems appeared in English in the &quot;Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars&quot;. During the years 1983-84, his work was banned in China due to a government campaign to combat &quot;spiritual pollution&quot;. When that campaign ended, his work appeared again in Chinese in a Communist Party publication called &quot;An Anthology of New Trends in Poetry&quot;, which Bei Dao has credited with having &quot;a profound and wide-reaching influence&quot; in China. In 1985, a selection of his work was included in an English-language anthology called &quot;Contemporary Chinese Literature&quot;, while his story collection, &quot;Waves&quot;, was published in Chinese by the Chinese University Press. Collectively, these publications introduced Bei Dao to scholars in the West, and he received an invitation to visit Europe in 1985. In the same year, his daughter, whom he nicknamed Tiantian, was born. In 1986, his collected poems appeared in Chinese. By the spring of 1987, he had taken up a post as a visiting lecturer at Durham University in England.

=== 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre ===

In the fall of 1988, Bei Dao and his wife and daughter returned to Beijing. In his home, he and his colleagues drafted a petition calling for the release of pro-democracy activists like Wei Jingsheng. Bei Dao and over thirty colleagues signed and publicly released the document in February 1989. When the government denounced the petition, Bei Dao and fellow activists held a press conference to announce an organized effort to promote democracy and human rights in China.

In April 1989, when student-led protests erupted in Tiananmen Square, Bei Dao was in San Francisco, taking part in a conference. &quot;Every day,&quot; he has written, &quot;my eyes were fixed on the developments of the situation at home&quot;. Protestors recited or displayed lines of Bei Dao&#x27;s poetry—particularly from his poems &quot;The Answer&quot; and &quot;Declaration&quot;—on posters and banners. The next month, he was in the Netherlands for a meeting of PEN International, where his presence on stage caused the Chinese delegation to leave in protest. On June 4, 1989, when the Chinese military forcibly ended the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, resulting in a mass number of casualties, Bei Dao was in West Berlin as a writer-in-residence at the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program. He has described that day as &quot;a nightmare&quot; that left him &quot;utterly dejected&quot;.

Citing Bei Dao&#x27;s influence via his advocacy and writing, the Chinese government banned him from returning to China. His wife and daughter remained in Beijing and were prevented from joining him. Several other Misty Poets were also exiled: Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, and Yang Lian. Speaking to foreign television outlets upon her escape from China, the student protest leader Chai Ling demonstrated the influence of Bei Dao&#x27;s work when she quoted from his poem, &quot;Declaration&quot;: &quot;I will not kneel on the ground / allowing the executioners to look tall / the better to obscure the wind of freedom&quot;.

=== Exile ===

Stranded in Europe, Bei Dao moved from one country to another. After his term as a visiting writer in West Berlin, he spent much of 1990 in Scandinavia, where, in Oslo, he and fellow exiles decided to revive &quot;Jintian&quot; as an émigré journal. His forced exile garnered global media attention as well as increased interest in his work. For example, in addition to invitations to speak at international literary conferences, two collections of his work appeared in the United States simultaneously: a poetry collection, &quot;The August Sleepwalker&quot;, and a fiction collection, &quot;Waves&quot;. Writing in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, the sinologist Jonathan Spence praised the books as &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;astonishing and beautiful&quot;. In 1991, Bei Dao relocated to Paris, where he lived on Rue de Venise, across from the Pompidou Center. Another poetry collection, &quot;Old Snow&quot;, appeared in English that year.

For the 1992-93 academic year, Bei Dao was a writer-in-residence at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Back in Paris in the summer of 1993, he co-founded the International Parliament of Writers, an organization dedicated to assisting authors in need of refuge or asylum. In the fall of 1993, he was appointed the McCandless Chair in the Humanities at Eastern Michigan University. The following year, he was a visiting faculty member at the University of Michigan. His third poetry collection to appear in English, &quot;Forms of Distance&quot;, was then published. While he received support from numerous institutions and individuals, his separation from family weighed heavily; he has spoken of the emotional distress he experienced during this period. In 1994, he attempted to return to China, but was detained on his arrival at Beijing Capital International Airport and then deported.

In 1995, he accepted a one-year faculty position at the University of California at Davis. That year, he was reunited with his wife and daughter, who were permitted to leave China, and he was able to see his parents during a visit to Paris. His fourth poetry collection to be published in English, &quot;Landscape Over Zero&quot;, also appeared in 1995. In all, buoyed by a Guggenheim Fellowship, he remained in Davis, California, for five years. He and his wife ultimately divorced and his daughter returned to Beijing to continue her education.

For the 2000-01 academic year, Bei Dao took up an appointment as the Lois and Willard Mackey Chair in Creative Writing at Beloit College. During that year, an essay collection, &quot;Blue House&quot;, and a poetry collection, &quot;Unlock&quot;, were published in English. In 2001, after his father became seriously ill, Bei Dao was granted permission to visit him in Beijing; his visit in December of that year marked his first time in China since 1989. The experience prompted him to begin work on a memoir about his youth.

In 2002, Bei Dao joined a delegation from the International Parliament of Writers—including Russell Banks, José Saramago, Wole Soyinka, Breyten Breytenbach, Vincenzo Consolo, Juan Goytisolo, and Christian Salmon—for a visit to the poet Mahmoud Darwish in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. The visit caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Portugal after Israel objected to José Saramago&#x27;s public characterization of Israeli policy toward Palestinians. The visit garnered further attention when the delegation met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Bei Dao described the trip in an essay, &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which became the title of a collection of essays that appeared in English in 2005.

Between 2002 and 2005, Bei Dao was based primarily in New York City. He taught at Stony Brook University, and spent a semester as a visiting writer at the University of Alabama. During this period, he remarried and had a son. From 2005 to 2007, he was a writer-in-residence at the University of Notre Dame.

=== Hong Kong and latest work ===

In 2006, the Chinese government allowed Bei Dao to return permanently to China. In 2007 he moved to Hong Kong, where he was offered a permanent faculty position at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. His visits to the mainland have been rare. For example, in 2011 he made a surprise visit to the Qinghai Lake International Poetry Festival, where he was swarmed by admirers. In 2009, he became a naturalized American citizen. In 2010, his memoir, &quot;City Gate, Open Up&quot;, appeared in Chinese (it appeared in English in 2017), and in the same year a retrospective of his poetry, &quot;The Rose of Time: New and Selected Poems&quot;, was published in English.

Beginning in 2014, Bei Dao served as editor for a series of books for children, an initiative he undertook after he was disappointed by the quality of poetry his son was taught in school.

In addition to his teaching, Bei Dao has organized two poetry initiatives in Hong Kong: in 2009, he launched International Poetry Nights in Hong Kong, which, since 2017, has been under the auspices of the Hong Kong Poetry Festival Foundation; he also launched a visiting writer series in cooperation with the Lee Hysan Foundation, which brings two foreign authors to Hong Kong each year and publishes their work in Chinese through Oxford University Press.

== Personal life ==
Bei Dao has one daughter from his first marriage to the artist Shao Fei. He lives with his current wife and their son in Hong Kong. In addition to writing and teaching, he pursues photography, and has exhibited his photographs at the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Museum in Beijing. He also paints, and has exhibited his paintings at the Galerie Paris Horizon in Paris. He turned to painting after suffering a stroke in 2012.

In his essay collections, Bei Dao has written about the many friendships he has made during his travels, including with notable literary figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Susan Sontag, Breyten Breytenbach, Tomas Tranströmer, Gary Snyder, and others.

== Honors ==
Bei Dao has won numerous awards for his writing. Honors bestowed for his body of work include:

Since his exile from China, Bei Dao has been mentioned in the press as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, with various sources claiming that he has been nominated for the prize numerous times. On at least one occasion, rumors drew reporters to his home in anticipation that he would win.

In 1996, he was a finalist for the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and in 2008 he was named a Puterbaugh Fellow at the University of Oklahoma.

Bei Dao has been, and continues to be, a featured speaker at institutions and cultural events around the world, including the Poetry International Festival Rotterdam, the Prague Writers&#x27; Festival, the PEN World Voices Festival, and many others. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages, and his poems have been widely anthologized.

== Work ==
Due largely to his personal story, Bei Dao&#x27;s writing has frequently been viewed through the lens of politics, a practice the poet has positioned himself against, arguing that &quot;true resistance lies in allowing poetry to separate itself from politics, leaving behind the language of states and thus freeing itself from the vicious circle of history&quot;. Elsewhere, he has bemoaned that journalists and critics have written about him as a political figure. Yet the prominent scholar of Bei Dao&#x27;s work, Bonnie S. McDougall, has noted the nuanced relationship of his work to politics: &quot;The central force of Bei Dao&#x27;s poetry has been his complex reaction to the pressures of a brutalized, conformist, and corrupt society…asserting his individuality in an apolitical mode that was ultimately subversive&quot;. As the poet and historian Julian Gewirtz put it, Bei Dao is &quot;a poet of political consequence, if not always quite a political poet&quot;.

=== Form ===
The foremost of Bei Dao&#x27;s methods of subverting literary norms in his native China has been through form. In China, expectations for art and artists were set forth at the 1942 Yan&#x27;an Forum on Literature and Art, where Mao Zedong described his view that all art is political and art in China should be connected to, and ultimately uplift, the masses. For poetry, this meant a reliance on classical and folk models with clearly comprehensible verses meant to inspire social morality as well as faith in communism.

By contrast, Bei Dao rarely makes use of conventional poetic forms. As McDougall notes, he has &quot;sought to find new formal devices within the general category of &#x27;free verse&#x27;…Conventional but dispensable grammatical forms and punctuation disappear between intensely compressed images; subject, tense, and number are elusive; transitions are unclear; order and logic are supplied by the reader&quot;. By using such an experimental approach, Bei Dao has achieved what the poet and critic Michael Palmer has called &quot;a poetry of complex enfoldings and crossings, of sudden juxtapositions and fractures, of pattern in a dance with randomness&quot;.

This approach to poetic form earned Bei Dao his moniker as a &quot;misty&quot; poet, which was originally leveled pejoratively by Chinese critics who disliked his work for its lack of clarity. Some critics in the West have similarly found his work to be incomprehensible. In response, McDougall places Bei Dao&#x27;s approach in context: &quot;The so-called obscurity or bizarreness of his writing is…not simply adopted for reasons of expedience but is an emotional necessity&quot; given the milieu in which he began to write. She elaborates that &quot;his verse is not obscure just because of fear of censorship but because the pain caused by all forms of oppression is so intense that conventional epithets are too shallow to express it&quot;.

=== Themes ===
Bei Dao&#x27;s approach to form has been said to reflect his major thematic concerns. Primary among these is his exploration of individuality, often embodied in a presentation of complexity and paradox. Palmer has described the work of Bei Dao—and of all of the Misty Poets—as &quot;a complex interweaving of inner and outer worlds, the private and the public, the personal and the official, the oneiric and the quotidian, the classical and the contemporary&quot;. Similarly, the scholar Dian Li argues that Bei Dao&#x27;s embrace of paradox is rooted in both Western tradition—e.g., Plato&#x27;s &quot;Parmenides&quot;—and Eastern tradition—e.g., popular folk tales like one about a blacksmith who creates both an invincible sword and an impenetrable shield—and by placing opposites together, one can arrive at a truth that is &quot;multiple, undifferentiated, and indeterminate&quot;. Or, as Bei Dao has said, &quot;There are many principles in the world, and many of these principles contradict each other. Tolerance for the existence of another&#x27;s principle is the basis for your own existence&quot;. By embracing the complexity of the world, in other words, one arrives at individuality. McDougall argues that this preoccupation in Bei Dao&#x27;s work is &quot;not a pretended or temporary escape from society&quot; but rather &quot;a commitment to non-political communication between people and the realization of the self&quot;.

Another of Bei Dao&#x27;s recurrent themes is language and its recovery from the political realm. According to the scholar Vera Schwarcz, the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s use of manifestos, slogans, and propaganda, with their underlying threat of oppression and violence, turned even innocent imagery (the sun and sky, for example) into ominous symbols. Bei Dao&#x27;s project has thus been to reclaim language for the imagination, to create, as the scholar Claudia Pozzana has termed it, &quot;an independent space for poetry&quot;. He has done this by expressly rejecting the political co-opting of certain words, as he does in his famous &quot;I don&#x27;t believe&quot; declarations from &quot;The Answer&quot;. In addition, an attempt to reclaim language can be seen in what Schwarcz calls &quot;the stammering quality of Bei Dao&#x27;s vernacular&quot;, through which the short, elusive nature of his verse attempts to mirror his personal experience and challenges political descriptions of the world.

=== Influences ===
Bei Dao has written of the influence on his early work of the Chinese poet Guo Lusheng (also known as &quot;Shi Zhi&quot;), whom he counts as an important precursor to the Misty Poets. In his youth, due to government restrictions and an abbreviated education, his exposure to Western literature was limited. In interviews, he has pointed to the influence of the Spanish modernist poets Federico García Lorca, Rafael Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre, and Antonio Machado, the Russian poets Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam, and in particular the German-language poet Paul Celan.

<text>Webb Institute is a private college focused on engineering and located in Glen Cove, New York. Each graduate of Webb Institute earns a Bachelor of Science degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. The school is noted in the marine industry for its unique emphasis on ship design, systems engineering, practical work experience, and free tuition for domestic students.

== History ==
Webb Institute was founded in 1889 by industrialist and philanthropist William Henry Webb, who had established his career as a preeminent shipbuilder in the 19th century. He recognized the increasing role of science and engineering in the field of ship design, which had long been seen as more of an art form. Webb felt that the ship designers of the future would need to be skilled in structural and mechanical engineering and other scientific disciplines. The institute graduated its first class in 1893 and continues to educate students in naval architecture and marine engineering.

===Founding and early history===
On April 2, 1889, the state of New York incorporated Webb&#x27;s Academy and Home for Shipbuilders as a non-profit institution. Webb had provided the academy with an endowment presumed to be sufficient to allow the institution to be self-supporting in perpetuity. It was intended to serve not only as an educational institution for future naval architects but also as a retirement home for aged shipbuilders.

Webb commissioned New York architect Arthur P. Jennings to design a building for the institution to be built on of land on a bluff overlooking the Harlem and Hudson rivers in the Bronx. Construction commenced in 1890 and was completed in 1893. The building was designed in the Romanesque Revival style and was built of New York brownstone. It was intended to be &quot;a romantic version of a medieval castle&quot;, with turrets, fanciful carving, and other flourishes. This facility was used for 50 years.

During World War II, the institute was closely associated with the U.S. Navy as a training center for naval officers.

===Move and expansion===
By 1945, the Board of Trustees determined that the Bronx campus was no longer suitable, lacking certain laboratory facilities, and ultimately sold it for a considerable sum. The site was redeveloped as the Fordham Hill Apartment complex.

In November 1945, the institute purchased its current home: The Braes, the former country estate of Herbert L. Pratt, in Glen Cove on the North Shore of Long Island. Designed by James Brite and constructed between 1912 and 1914, the main house had a distinct H-shaped layout and Jacobean, Tudor, and Renaissance-influenced design elements that made it distinct among Long Island estates of the era. It was the largest of the six Pratt estates in Glen Cove. Conversion work began in 1946.

In April 1947, classes began at the new campus in Glen Cove. The main building had been renovated to include classrooms, dormitories, and offices. A model basin and gymnasium were constructed elsewhere on the campus. The main building was renamed Stevenson Taylor Hall in honor of the charter member and president of the Board of Trustees (1900–1926) of the institute. Through the conversion, the ground floor of Stevenson Taylor Hall retained much of the original 1915-era decor.

A modern library and auditorium were added to the campus in 1971. Webb first admitted women as students in 1974.

Webb Institute was used for the exterior shots of Wayne Manor in the 1995 film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, again in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, and for interior and exterior shots for the 2014 TV series &quot;Gotham&quot;. The Webb Institute reprised its earlier film role as Wayne Manor for the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;. It was also featured in the 1998 film &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. Interior and exterior shots appeared in the 2015 TV series &quot;Limitless&quot; in Season 1, Episode 14.

===Administrators===
There have been 18 administrators of the institute:

==Academics==
The student body of Webb Institute typically numbers around 90, with 20% being female. Webb currently has 12 full-time faculty members and no teaching assistants. Students have high access to professors, who routinely make themselves available at most hours. Adjunct faculty from local colleges teach some humanities courses at Webb such as Political Philosophy and Japanese.

There are four classrooms, one for each class. The school is atypical as the professors, rather than students, rotate to each classroom because of its small size. The front portion of the classroom is dedicated to lecture hours, while the rear has rows of drafting tables, one for each student, along with bookshelves and couches for 24-7 personalized study space.

The centerpiece of Webb&#x27;s academic facilities is the -long model ship model basin, which is frequently used by students and faculty alike for experiments and research. Webb Institute has its own physics and chemistry laboratories, an extensive library, an engineering lab for mechanical and electrical experiments, a carpentry shop, and a machine shop. Students have limited around-the-clock access to these facilities. There is an emphasis throughout Webb&#x27;s academic program on hands-on experience, and several classes require conducting experiments or building and testing models.

Webb Institute&#x27;s coursework is intense. Students spend up to 5 hours per day in lecture and can spend several hours per day working outside of class. During the mandatory internship period from January through February each year, students seek positions in the maritime industry, including shipyards, design offices, and aboard merchant vessels. All seniors are required to complete a senior thesis. Seniors are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, in which they usually perform exceptionally well.

85% of incoming students make it to graduation. Many graduates establish careers in the maritime industry, with 100% job placement. Graduates also forge careers in other engineering fields or find success in finance or law. About a third of each graduating class goes on to pursue an advanced degree. Webb has an active alumni association which supports graduates, fosters a thriving social network, and maintains an alumni fund. The alumni giving rate is over 70%, one of the highest rates in the United States.

Because of the founder&#x27;s endowment and the high alumni giving rate, students who are U.S. citizens are not charged tuition at Webb. Students pay for room and board, books, and various fees. The Bachelor of Science degree is awarded after four years of &quot;total immersion&quot; study, which includes several months of job experience through internship periods.

The institute maintains close relationships with the nearby United States Merchant Marine Academy and State University of New York Maritime College, along with Cooper Union.

===Winter Work===
Winter Work is Webb Institute&#x27;s term for its unique internship periods. Webb students are required to work in certain areas of the marine industry for 8 weeks during the months of January and February. Freshmen act as apprentices/mechanics in shipyards or boatyards, and sophomores as cadets/observers at sea. Juniors and seniors perform internships in various engineering firms and design offices. By the time students graduate, they have 8 months of work experience. Recently, Winter Work has become increasingly more global, with several students traveling overseas to China, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, and the United Arab Emirates.

===Accreditation===
Webb Institute is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.

==Culture==

===Residential life===
Students generally live on campus for all four years. Webb Institute has no fraternities or sororities. There is a student-run Social Committee at Webb that holds several parties throughout the year. The Social Committee also organizes off-campus trips throughout the year.

===Honor Code===
The student body adheres to an Honor Code, which prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. The Student Organization administers the Honor Code, operates the student treasury, oversees social activities, and serves as liaison between students and the school administration.

===Extracurricular activities===
Webb has five intercollegiate athletic teams: sailing year-round, soccer and basketball in the fall, and volleyball and tennis in the spring.

Students have many options for recreation during their studies. The school has its own yacht club, automotive workshop, and English pub. Intercollegiate sports include sailing, tennis, soccer, volleyball, ultimate, and basketball. New York City is an hour away by the Long Island Rail Road. There are many student-led activity clubs on campus as well, both sporting and intellectual.

Webb won the 2018 HVIAC men&#x27;s tennis championship. This is the first championship Webb sports has won in recent history.

== Athletics ==
The Webb athletic teams are called the Webbies. The institute is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) as an Independent, for most of its sports since the 2023–24 academic year; while its sailing team competes in the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (MAISA). The Webbies previously competed in the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (HVIAC) for most of its sports from 2004–05 to 2023–23.

Webb competes in five intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, sailing, soccer, tennis and volleyball.

<doc id="718403" wikidata="Q25686487" url="?curid=718403" title="Abu Luqman">
<text>Ali Moussa Al-Shawakh, (; 1973 –17 April 2018) known by his kunya Abu Luqman (), Abu Ayyub al-Ansari () or Ali al-Hamoud (), was a Syrian man and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant governor of Raqqa, Syria as of July 2015. He used to be governor of Aleppo province.

==History==
Abu Luqman was born in as-Sahl village in Raqqa province. He studied law at the University of Aleppo. He is from the Ajeel clan of Raqqa. It is claimed he used to have a Sufi orientation because he followed Mahmud al-Aghasi (known as Abu Qaqa) who was the leader of Ghuraba al-Sham.

He was freed from Sednaya Prison, Damascus in the summer of 2011 by President Bashar al-Assad, at the outset of the uprising against the Syrian government.

==ISIL activity==

According to Ibrahim Muslem, a human-rights activist quoted by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Abu Luqman decides who gets the oil&quot;. At Mr. Luqman&#x27;s discretion, smugglers paid for fuel and loaded it into tanker trucks. Refined products from the Akrish refinery were driven more than 200 miles to Syrian villages near the Turkish border, according to Mr. Muslem.

Mohammed al-Saleh, a spokesman for the advocacy group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, quoted in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, said Abu Luqman replaced several foreign generals with locals after the loss of the town of Tell Abyad.

He was also responsible for the execution of Abu Saad al-Hadram, Jabhat al-Nusra&#x27;s commander for Raqqa province.

===2014===
In early 2014, he was ISIL&#x27;s chief interrogator in Raqqa province. As of April 2014, he was the IS emir of Raqqa province. In this role, he was the primary official responsible for appointing other ISIL leaders, distributing fighters among the various IS fighting fronts, and publicizing ISIL military operations. In mid-2014, he ordered the beheading of two hostages held by ISIL.

As of late 2014, he was a member of ISIL&#x27;s eight-member governing council. His responsibilities for ISIL included frequently traveling across Syria to transfer ISIL prisoners. Also in late 2014, he changed his name when he was reported dead in the press as a security measure. 

===2015===

In early 2015, he was a member of an ISIL governance council chaired by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As of early 2015, he was the senior figure in charge of ISIL detention of Western hostages.

In June 2015, he was the governor of Aleppo and the security emir for Syria responsible for foreign fighters. Previously as governor of Raqqa, he was responsible for executions. In July 2015, he was reappointed governor of Raqqa and was the de facto chief in Raqqa, overseeing security affairs. As of mid-2015, he was ISIL&#x27;s overall security amir at a Raqqa detention facility holding more than 1,000 ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight.

===US and UN sanctions===

On 29 September 2015 he was added to the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals List.

The US Department of Treasury further describes his role, saying &quot;Al-Shawakh is being designated for acting for or on behalf of ISIL, an entity designated pursuant to E.O. 13224. As of mid-2015, Syrian national al-Shawakh served as ISIL’s governor for Raqqa, Syria, after having served as ISIL’s senior security official for Syria and as governor in Aleppo, roles in which he directed combat assignments for foreign fighters. Al-Shawakh was in charge of ISIL’s detention of foreign hostages, and oversaw the appointment of other ISIL leaders. Al-Shawakh supervised security matters, including executions, interrogations, and transfers of ISIL prisoners, at an Raqqa detention facility used to hold foreign hostages and ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight. In mid-2014, al-Shawakh ordered the beheadings of two ISIL hostages. Al-Shawakh also served on a governance council chaired by ISIL leader and U.S. and UN-designated SDGT Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (AKA Dr. Ibrahim al-Badri)&quot;.

He is also sanctioned by the United Nations who said, &quot;Ali Musa al-Shawakh was listed on 29 February 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 2161 (2014) as being associated with Al-Qaida for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of” the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115)&quot;.

==Death==
Abu Luqman was reportedly killed by an Iraqi airstrike on 17 April 2018.

<text>Vulcan is a pumice cone in Papua New Guinea. It is a sub-vent of the Rabaul caldera and lies on its western rim. Its most recent eruption was in 1994, when it and another vent, Tavurvur, forced the city of Rabaul to be temporarily abandoned and the local administrative centres of East New Britain Province to be moved to a new capital, Kokopo. Today, the slopes of Vulcan are now forested, as a result of dormancy since 1994.

Vulcan did not exist during the German colonial times, although the agronomist for the New Guinea Company, Richard Parkinson, noticed that a small island in the harbour in 1880 had grown noticeably larger by 1900. During the 1920s the island offered enough new land for Australian colonials to open a sporting club there, with tennis courts. By 1937 Vulcan was its current size and erupted that year, filling the harbour with a thick layer of pumice. An Australian Navy sailor walked out from the wharf some hundred meters before he broke through the crust and drowned.

<text>Tavurvur is an active stratovolcano near Rabaul, on the island of New Britain, in Papua New Guinea. It is a sub-vent of the Rabaul caldera and lies on the eastern rim of the larger feature. An eruption of the volcano largely destroyed the nearby town of Rabaul in 1994.

Mount Tavurvur is the most active volcano in Rabaul caldera, and erupted most recently on 29 August 2014.

The correct pronunciation of the volcano&#x27;s name is tah-VOOR-voor, according to the Rabaul Volcanological Observatory.

<doc id="718442" wikidata="Q7885568" url="?curid=718442" title="Union Commonwealth University">
<text>Union Commonwealth University (formerly Union College) is a private university in Barbourville, Kentucky. The university was founded in 1879 and is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Union&#x27;s approximately 825 undergraduate students represent 27 states and nine countries.

Union&#x27;s campus is in southeastern Kentucky. Approximately 44 percent of the students live in three residence halls and apartments on campus.

==Academics==
Union Commonwealth University offers the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science degrees. The college also offers Master of Arts in Psychology and Education. Additionally, new programs at the Master&#x27;s level include Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Administration, and Master of Science in Athletic Administration.

The college operates on a two-semester calendar, with a May interim session and two summer terms. Students must successfully complete a total of 120 semester hours to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree, including 35 hours of required core classes from the four major divisions of study.

===Study abroad===
Union Commonwealth University is a cooperating member of the Kentucky Institute for International Studies (KIIS). The college joins with a number of other Kentucky colleges and universities to provide summer study opportunities in ten different locations. The programs in Argentina, France, Spain, Mexico, Germany, Austria, Italy and Ecuador are open to all Union College students, who may earn credits toward their degree at Union.

=== Rankings ===
Union Commonwealth University&#x27;s ranking in the 2022-2023 edition of U.S. &quot;News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s Best Colleges was #103-135 among &quot;Regional Universities South&quot;.

==Campus==
The campus includes more than 100 gently rolling acres covered in overhanging elms, mountain laurel, and Georgian architecture. The Wilderness Road spans the east side of the campus, and Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is approximately away. The campus is in the city of Barbourville, approximately east of Interstate 75 and surrounded by four state parks filled with falls, lakes, and streams.

===Academic facilities===
The Weeks-Townsend Memorial Library contains more than 160,000 books, periodicals, government documents, media materials and online reference and full-text databases. Library functions, including the public catalog access (OPAC), circulation and reserves are fully automated through the Sirsi Unicorn Collection Management System. The 20-seat computer lab is the center of campus access to the Internet, including email and the World Wide Web. The college also has a variety of computers accessible to students. The library and Centennial computer labs each contain 20 workstations and a laser printer connected to the campus network. A third lab, the Hensley lab, provides the same type of access with 17 computers. The labs are open a variety of hours each week to support the academic programs and provide student access to the campus network.

The Academic Resource Center (ARC) provides free services to Union Commonwealth University students in several academic support areas. Individual tutoring is available in a variety of subject areas in both upper and lower division classes. Students may work with a tutor to review for classes, refresh study skills, or prepare for professional examinations such as GMAT, LSAT, MCAT, GRE, and NTE. Each semester, courses that have been deemed academically challenging are selected for Supplemental Instruction (SI). Students attend group study sessions, which are held a minimum of three times a week with a student leader who has already excelled in that particular course. The SI leaders model good study strategies and encourage collaborative learning.

The Sharp Academic Center is one of the primary classroom facilities on campus. Named for alumnus and Nobel Laureate Phillip Allen Sharp, the Sharp Academic Center was added to a remodeled dormitory, providing classroom and office space. Currently, the offices include the Office of the President, the Office of the Academic Vice President, Student Support Services, the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the Department of History.

The Ramsey Center is an additional classroom and laboratory space on campus. Named for Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey, the center was remodeled from the former Knox County Hospital. This building houses the Department of Natural Sciences, the Psychology Department, and the Edna Jenkins Mann School of Nursing.

==Athletics==
Union Commonwealth University&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) for most of its sports since the 2002–03 academic year; while its men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s bowling and archery teams compete in the Mid-South Conference (MSC), which they previously competed as a full member from 1995–96 to 2001–02.

<text>A result set is the set of results returned by a query, usually in the same format as the database the query is called on. For example, in SQL, which is used in conjunction with relational databases, it is the result of a codice_1 query on a table or view and is itself a non-permanent table of rows, and could include metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. In an object database, the result set is usually a collection of objects from the database.

Depending on the database, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on the fly. A cursor can be used by client applications to fetch a few rows of the result set at a time.

== Sorting ==
In SQL, there is no guarantee that the rows of a result set returned by a codice_2 query are in any particular order unless the codice_3 clause is used in the query, which sorts the rows of the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

<doc id="718460" wikidata="Q7885570" url="?curid=718460" title="Union Adventist University">
<text>Union Adventist University (formerly Union College) is a private Seventh-day Adventist college in Lincoln, Nebraska. Known as Union College from 1891 to May5, 2024, it is owned and operated by the Mid-America Union Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is accredited by the Adventist Accrediting Association (AAA) and the Higher Learning Commission. It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world&#x27;s second largest Christian school system.

==History==
L. A. Hoopes and a committee of church leaders, including influential Adventist scholar and administrator W. W. Prescott, came to Lincoln, Nebraska in search of land to establish a college in the Midwest. In September 1891, Union College opened its doors to students with Prescott serving as its first president. The present-day community of College View grew around the college campus. During the 1920s, the college experienced a difficult period due to the shrinking enrollment and budget deficits. In 1939, former mayor of Lincoln Don Lathrop Love donated money for the college to build an industrial building and established a life annuity with the college a year later.

The 1970s saw major expansion of the college, including the construction of the iconic 100-foot clock tower, Everett Dick Administration Building, the college&#x27;s lab school George Stone School and College View Church. The radio station KUCV was also operated by the college from its 1974 sign-on until it was sold in 1989.

In 1981, Union held its first annual service day, cancelling classes to allow students and staff to volunteer at local service projects. This collegiate service day, initially named Project Brush and later Project Impact, is the longest-running event of its kind in the United states.

In 2004, Union began offering the unique International Rescue and Relief program, a bachelor&#x27;s degree training students in disaster response, emergency management, and international development. Teams from this program respond to regional and international disasters.

In 2024, due to the increasing number of graduate programs offered and confusion with other institutions named &quot;Union College&quot;, the name of the institution was changed to Union Adventist University.

== Campus ==
The 50 acre campus is located in southeastern Lincoln, surrounded by residential areas and small businesses. Major campus buildings include the Clocktower, Everett Dick Administration Building; the Don Love Building housing library and auditorium, Ortner Center with cafeteria and conference facilities; Krueger Center for science and mathematics, AdventHealth Center with exercise facilities and nursing, Engel Hall with music and fine arts, the Thunderdome gymnasium, Prescott Hall men&#x27;s residence, and Rees Hall women&#x27;s residence. The campus is also the location of the Joshua C. Turner Arboretum, a site of the Nebraska Statewide Arboretum, hosting over 100 species of plants.

==Academics==
The college is organized into eight divisions:
* Business and Computer Science
* Emergency Management and Exercise Science
* Fine Arts
* Human Development
* Humanities
* Nursing
* Religion
* Science &amp; Math

In addition to undergraduate degrees, the college offers Masters programs in Leadership, Occupational Therapy, Public Health, and Physician Assistant Studies.

== Athletics ==
In athletics, Union plays as the Warriors and fields a limited number of sports, but is not a member of a major college sports association but rather the Association of Christian College Athletics (ACCA). As such, their teams tend to play against bible colleges, community colleges, and JV teams. The university also hosts three tournaments each year (one for basketball, soccer, and volleyball) for Seventh-day Adventist high school teams.

<text>Union University is a private Baptist university in Jackson, Tennessee, with additional campuses in Germantown and Hendersonville. The university is affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention (Southern Baptist Convention). It was established in 1875 as &quot;Southwestern Baptist University&quot; on the campus of the former West Tennessee College. It absorbed the Hall-Moody Junior College of Martin, Tennessee.

==History==

===Predecessors===
&quot;Jackson Male Academy&quot; was founded in Jackson, Tennessee in 1823 as a preparatory school for wealthy students. The Tennessee General Assembly chartered the academy in 1825. In 1844, the academy reorganized and rechartered as &quot;West Tennessee College&quot;. During the Civil War, the college was used as a military hospital by Confederate and Union troops. West Tennessee College reopened after the war. In 1874, the Tennessee Baptists acquired the college.

&quot;Union University&quot; was established at Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1849. It went inactive due to the Civil War in 1859 but operated again between 1868 and 1873.

=== Early history ===
The East Tennessee Baptist General Association, the General Association of Baptists in Middle Tennessee, and the West Tennessee Baptist Convention met in Humbolt, Tennessee on March 15, 1873, adopting a resolution to establish a &quot;first-class college&quot;. This resulted in an Educational Convention that met on April 10, 187,4 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee at the former campus of Union University. The convention explored potential locations for a new campus, eventually recommending Jackson. Their recommendation included taking over the endowment and campus of West Tennessee College.

The Tennessee General Assembly issued a charter for a new school, Southwestern Baptist University, in June 1875. Southwestern Baptist University opened in October 1875 in Jackson. It was a preparatory school the first year, adding college courses for its second year. Many of Southwestern&#x27;s early faculty and trustees were alumni or former faculty of Union University.

In 1907, Southwestern trustee T. T. Eaton left his 6,000-volume library to the college. Eaton was a former professor of Union University, where his father, Joseph H. Eaton, was a former president. On September 17, 1907, Southwestern changed its name to Union University to honor the Eatons and others from Union at Murfreesboro who had impacted Southwestern as faculty, administrators, trustees, and contributors.

In 1925 the Tennessee Baptist Convention secured a charter that vested the rights, authority, and property of Union University in the Tennessee Convention. This charter included the election of the university&#x27;s trustees. Two years later, the Convention consolidated &quot;Hall-Moody Junior College&quot; at Martin (1900–1927) with Union University; the former Hall-Moody campus subsequently became the location of the University of Tennessee Junior College, now the University of Tennessee at Martin.

The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Union University accreditation in 1948. From the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Union operated an Extension Center in the Memphis area.

===Craig and Barefoot administrations===
During President Robert Craig (1967–85) and President Hyran Barefoot&#x27;s (1987–1996) administrations:
*Enrollment increased from fewer than 1,000 students to more than 2,000
*Penick Academic Complex was enlarged several times
*Additional housing units were erected
*Blasingame Academic Complex (1986) and the Hyran E. Barefoot Student Union Building (1994) were constructed

In 1962 Union developed a nursing program with the assistance of Jackson-Madison County General Hospital at the request of local physicians. In 1975 Union moved from downtown Jackson, Tennessee, to a new campus located near the Highway 45-Bypass in north Jackson. From 1987 to 1995, Union offered the degree-completion program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN to BSN track) in Memphis. At that time there were over 300 graduates of this program.

===David S. Dockery&#x27;s administration===

David S. Dockery was elected as the fifteenth president of Union University in December 1995. Dockery brought a desire to take Union to a more rigorous, conservative path. During his administration, which lasted until 2014, the university:
*increased enrollment from 2200 (in 1996) to more than 5300 (in 2012);
*constructed two residence halls, Miller Tower, Jennings Hall, Hammons Hall, Fesmire Field House, and the new White Hall science building;
*completed the $60 million comprehensive &quot;Building a Future&quot; campaign (1998–2005) (now at $69 million);
*renewed commitment to scholarship and research among Union faculty-part of Union&#x27;s new Center for Faculty Development;
*created new undergraduate majors in political science, physics, theology, digital media studies, church history, ethics, sports management, sports medicine, and engineering; and graduate programs in education (M.Ed., Ed.S., and Ed.D.), nursing (MSN with tracks in education, administration, and nurse anesthesia), and intercultural studies (MAIS);
*achieved SACS Level V accreditation;
*established an extension campus in Germantown, Tennessee;
*established the Carl F.H. Henry Center for Christian Leadership;
*Established the Charles Colson Chair for Faith and Culture;
*implemented the $110 million &quot;Union 2010&quot; plan that includes the future addition of new tennis courts, new intramural fields, and an amphitheater, which has already included the completion of a second soccer field, the Fesmire Fieldhouse, and the state-of-the-art science building, White Hall.
* launched a Doctor of Pharmacy program.

===2008 tornado===


On February 5, 2008, at 7:02 p.m., the university was struck by an EF4 tornado, with winds between . The tornado destroyed 18 dormitory buildings and caused over $40 million worth of damage to the campus, which suffered a direct hit, rendering almost 80% of the dormitory space either destroyed or unlivable. None of the approximately 1,800 students on campus at the time were killed.

Fifty-one students were taken to Jackson-Madison General Hospital. While most students were released after being treated, nine were kept overnight. Some students were trapped for hours while emergency crews worked to rescue them. A total of 31 buildings received damage of varying degrees. The devastation captured nationwide attention and was featured by CNN, Fox News, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and numerous regional news outlets. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, FEMA Director R. David Paulison and Governor of Tennessee Phil Bredesen all visited the campus after the disaster.

&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; reported that due to extensive damage, the campus would not reopen until February 18. Lambuth University, a rival area university, reportedly offered to open its dormitories to displaced Union students. The congregation of Englewood Baptist Church, which owned the Old English Inn in Jackson, voted unanimously to open the inn to Union students. The church&#x27;s move accommodated almost 300 students until December 2008. The university also expected that around 200 students would be housed in the private homes of Union faculty, staff, and friends.

The February 5, 2008, event was the second time in just over five years that the campus was hit by a tornado. On the evening of November 10, 2002, during the Veterans Day Weekend tornado outbreak, the university was struck by an F1 tornado, with winds of approximately 100 miles per hour, which did approximately 2 million dollars worth of damage to the university. There were no serious injuries. Union president David Dockery stated that the February 5, 2008 tornado was about 15 times as bad at the 2002 tornado. The damage caused by the February 5th tornado was estimated at $40 million.

===Presidents===
Presidents of the university have included:
==Academics==
Union University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Its business program is also accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

===Hendersonville facilities===
Union&#x27;s newest location is in Hendersonville, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville. This campus offers graduate degrees in education and Christian studies.

===Housing===
In Jackson, Union has apartment-style living. Each student has a separate private bedroom that shares a common living space with three roommates. All apartments feature a high-speed Internet connection, as well as a kitchen unit. Some apartments feature private phone lines or a washer and dryer. All private living spaces have a window and the common areas have cable TV access. There is no student housing at the Germantown campus. Temporary off-campus housing was at The Jett (the former Old English Inn) for the majority of the spring 2008 semester.

==Athletics==
Union (Tenn.) athletic teams are the Bulldogs. The university is a member of the NCAA Division II level, primarily competing in the Gulf South Conference (GSC) since the 2012–13 academic year. They were also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Mid-East Region of the Division I level. The Bulldogs previously competed in the defunct TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1996–97 to 2011–12. Union began the three-year transition to full NCAA Division II membership in 2011.

Union (Tenn.) competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball,l and volleyball. Former sports included cheerleading.

===Accomplishments===
In the NAIA, Union captured five women&#x27;s basketball national titles (1998, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010). Union also has won national titles in the NCCAA in volleyball (2003), men&#x27;s soccer (2004), softball (2001, 2002, 2004, 2013) and women&#x27;s basketball (2014).

==Student life==

=== Greek life ===
There are six social fraternities and sororities on campus, two music fraternities, and numerous academic fraternities.

Each of these groups is relatively large relative to the size of the institution and consistently contributes to philanthropies, both regionally and globally. The number of members in the social fraternities can range between 20 and 80 members per chapter.

The fraternities and sororities are an active presence on campus through philanthropy, intramural sports, and Greek Olympics.

The fraternities represented on campus are:

The sororities represented on campus are:
The academic fraternities are:
=== LGBT students ===
Union University is an affiliate of the Southern Baptist Convention, and as such strictly follows a Baptist interpretation of Christian scripture. This has led to some controversies with regard to intolerance of LGBT ideologies. The school has a code of conduct that prohibits among other things, homosexual behavior and advocacy, as well as premarital sex and alcohol. However, former students have said that the anti-gay policies are enforced much more strictly than others. While heterosexual students received small fines for violations, homosexual students were given the choice of conversion therapy or expulsion.

In 2008, Union denied access to the Soulforce Equality Ride, an effort to fight discrimination against gay people. Students were warned to have no contact with the group and one student who approached them was subsequently investigated. Soulforce participants were arrested for trespassing.

In 2015, Union withdrew from the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities after two council colleges changed their policies to allow hiring faculty members in same-sex marriages. Four members of the university faculty signed the 2017 Nashville Statement, an evangelical Christian statement of faith relating to human sexuality and gender roles that was perceived by some as expressing homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny.

In 2020, the school rescinded an admissions offer to a gay graduate-level nursing student, Alex Duron, after investigating his sexual orientation. Duron subsequently joined an unsuccessful lawsuit, &quot;Elizabeth Hunter, et al. v. U.S. Department of Education&quot;, seeking to end discrimination against LGBTQ+ students at publicly funded religious colleges and universities. Union University president Dub Oliver defended the school&#x27;s actions by pointing to the college&#x27;s religious exemption from the prohibitions on discrimination in Title IX, which it had applied for and received from the U.S. Department of Education, and to the college&#x27;s statement of principles, which all students agree to follow.

<doc id="718504" wikidata="Q651942" url="?curid=718504" title="Buick Century">
<text>Buick Century is the model name that was used by Buick for a line of upscale full-size cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958, as well as from 1973 to 2005 for mid-size cars.

The first Buick Century debuted as the Series 60 then renamed in 1936 as a shorter and lighter model featuring the same engine as the bigger Roadmaster and Limited series giving it more performance while using the shorter wheelbase body of the Buick Special. During the 1930s and 1940s it was Buick&#x27;s companion to the top level Roadmaster and was offered as a 2-door and 4-door sedan and convertible. The Century name was used on six generations of cars of varying sizes as well as performance and trim levels. In 1969, Buick developed a concept car known as the Century Cruiser. In the 1970s, the Century Regal became a separate model and market positioning between the two products changed from year to year depending on sales. The Century was updated to front wheel drive in 1982 and was Buick&#x27;s 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan and station wagon, with regular updates and feature upgrades as customer preferences changed over time.

==Series 60 (1930–1935)==

Originally, the Series 60 had the OHV Buick Straight-6 engine from the Series 70, developing at 2,800 rpm. It had, at the beginning of the generation, a full-length running board denoting the top model for Buick at the time, shared with the short wheelbase, entry level Series 40. In 1930, GM built 38,180 cars. The bodystyles available were torpedo, sedan, coupe, and roadster convertible, using GM&#x27;s &quot;B-body&quot; platform. Starting with this generation, all GM cars shared a corporate appearance as a result of the &quot;Art and Colour Section&quot; headed by Harley J. Earl and modest yearly changes were introduced to freshen the appearance.

In 1931, the running board was reduced and the OHV Buick Straight-8 engine was introduced that developed . Aesthetically, the Series 60 remained almost unchanged, and the same fact occurred also in the following year. In 1931 and 1932, a total of 55,135 were produced.

In 1933, the length of the body increased and the radiator was now concealed behind a façade with a grille. The engine power increased to , and 1933 was the first year all GM vehicles were installed with optional vent windows which were initially called “No Draft Individually Controlled Ventilation” later renamed &quot;Ventiplanes&quot;. In 1934, the appearance was changed to a more rounded appearance, with a new OHV eight-cylinder engine and 100 hp. In 1935, the model remained almost unchanged while the body style selections were similar to larger Buicks but more affordably priced. Six choices were available to include both 2- and 4-door convertibles using the term &quot;phaeton&quot; for the 4-door convertible with a listed price of US$1,675 ($ in dollars ). Total production from 1933 to 1935 was 31,385. In 1936, the model changed its name to &quot;Century&quot;.


==First generation (1936–1942)==
Buick renamed its entire model lineup for the 1936 model year to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models, introducing a &quot;streamlined&quot; appearance. Buick&#x27;s Series 40 model range became the Special, the Series 60 became the Century, the Series 80 became the Roadmaster, and the Series 90, Buick&#x27;s longest and most luxurious vehicles, became the Limited. The terminology &quot;Series 60&quot; and &quot;Series 70&quot; were shared with Cadillac, while &quot;Series 60&quot;, &quot;Series 70&quot;, &quot;Series 80&quot; and &quot;Series 90&quot; were shared with Oldsmobile.

The basic formula for the 1936 to 1942 Century was established by mating the shorter wheelbase Special bodies to the Roadmaster&#x27;s larger displacement straight-eight engine. The Century offered four different types of 2-door body styles to include convertibles and only one 4-door Sedan, with the ratio remaining coupes over sedans until 1938 when there were three coupe and three sedan choices. The 1940 Series 50 Super combined the longer Roadmaster body with the smaller displacement Special engine.

While the Special was powered by Buick&#x27;s OHV straight-8 engine, rated at 3200 rpm, Centurys produced between 1936 and 1942 were powered by the OHV straight-8 producing , making them the fastest Buicks of the era and capable of sustained speeds of , hence the name Century (100), earning the Century the nickname &quot;the banker&#x27;s hot rod&quot;. Prices listed for the 2-door Victoria Coupe started at US$1,055 ($ in dollars ) to US$1,135 ($ in dollars ) for the 2-door Convertible. By 1940 prices rose to US$1,175 ($ in dollars ) for the Sport Coupe to US$1,620 ($ in dollars ) for the 4-door Convertible Phaeton.

The Century was discontinued at the end of the abbreviated 1942 model year due to World War II, when production of passenger vehicles stopped on February 4, 1942, during which total model production only accounted for about 10% of Buick&#x27;s total output.

==Second generation (1954–1958)==
Buick reintroduced the Century using the same formula of mating the smaller, lighter Buick Special body to its largest and most powerful &quot;Fireball&quot; OHV V8 engine mated with a Dynaflow automatic transmission, with the intent of giving Buick a performance vehicle. Included in the model lineup during this period was a station wagon model, a body style that had been unavailable during the Century&#x27;s first production period of 1936 until 1942. In 1953 &quot;The Buick-Berle Show&quot; introduced product placement commercials on TV, and later in 1955 &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was one of the sponsors.

Introduced in the middle of the 1955 model year, the four-door Buick Century Riviera along with the four-door Special Riviera, the four-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, and four-door 88 Holiday, were the first four-door hardtops ever produced. For the first time, the Century was repositioned below the C-body Buick Super and priced lower. It continued to feature four &quot;VentiPorts&quot; on the front fenders like the larger Buick Roadmaster indicating its status equal to the Super, denoting it was a junior level Buick using the shorter B-body. It also introduced the &quot;Panoramic&quot; one-piece wrap around windshield on all GM cars for 1955.

In 1955, the California Highway Patrol placed a large fleet order for 270 Century two-door sedans, a body style unavailable to the general public. It combined the Special two-door sedan body shell with Century powertrain, of which 135 were Dynaflow automatics and 135 were manual transmissions. Broderick Crawford was shown driving a two-door Century sedan during the first season of his popular syndicated TV series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;. These Century two-door sedans were actual police vehicles owned by the California Highway Patrol and were loaned to the TV production company, the CHP door emblems were changed to a generic highway patrol emblem. (In later seasons, he drove a four-door Century but these were not California Highway Patrol owned vehicles.) Power brakes were optional. Tubeless tires were new.

The Century remained Buick&#x27;s performance line, with engine power rising from (SAE gross) in 1954, to in 1955, to in 1956, and topping out at from a bored-out engine in 1957 and 1958, the last model years for the full-sized Century line.

In 1956, the Century&#x27;s base price was US$2,963 ($ in dollars ). Power windows were standard in the convertible. A padded safety dash became optional.

For 1957, Buick styling was notable for its three-piece rear window design. This was a feature in all series fixed-roof body-styles, (excluding wagons and convertibles). Oldsmobile also used this 3-piece rear window design that year, marketed as the “Twin-Strutted Rear Window.”

Because the Century was considered the senior &quot;small Buick&quot;, the model received a version of GM&#x27;s hardtop station wagon, the Century Caballero Estate for the 1957 and 1958 model years and was not continued for 1959.

For 1959, Buick renamed the Century the Invicta.

==Third generation (1973–1977)==
The Buick Century nameplate was revived for the 1973 model year on the rear-wheel drive intermediate A-body platform, which was redesigned for this year. The name replaced Skylark for Buick&#x27;s mid-sized cars. The Century Regal coupe was added at the top of the model range and later became a separate series, dropping the Century name for 1976. It was available with two- and four-barrel versions of the Buick 350, putting out , respectively. The 455 was also an option. The base Century and Century 350 coupes had a fastback roof with large rear quarter glass, while the Century Luxus featured a more formal notchback roofline with narrow opera windows. The Century Estate replaced the Buick Sport Wagon.

By replacing the Skylark, the Century inherited the Gran Sport performance option. The package was available with any engine and included upgraded suspension, additional instrumentation, and unique appearance treatment. Dual exhaust increased output of the four-barrel 350 to . While the Stage I 455 was somewhat diminished from its performance heyday due to emission controls, output was competitive for the era at and . A Saginaw three-speed manual was standard with either 350 engine. A Muncie M-21 four-speed was available with either 350 or with the regular 455, while the Stage I required a Turbo-Hydramatic 400.

The 1974 Buick Century and Regal were introduced with HEI (High-Energy Ignition systems) instead of points and ignition coil. The 1974 Buick Century Gran Sport was still, &quot;Available only as a Hardtop Colonnade Coupe, it carries the Rallye ride and handling suspension with stabilizer bars, front and rear. Plus a specialized blacked-out grille and head lamp doors, an accent stripe on the rear deck, special tail lamps and Gran Sport grille ornamentation. And if you go for the Gran Sport, you can add the Stage 1, the high performance engine.&quot;

For 1975, the Luxus was renamed Century Custom. The new 231 V6 was installed as standard equipment along with a three-speed manual transmission on coupes and sedans, and the big-block 455 was no longer available. The four-barrel 350 V8 became standard on station wagons. A new landau top became available for fastback coupes that partially covered the rear quarter glass, giving an appearance similar to the formal-roof Century Custom. A Century Special coupe was added to the lineup, using the fastback roofline. The Special was marketed as an economy variant of the Century and was only available with the V6 engine.

In 1975, the US government legalized rectangular headlights and Buick added them to the Century for the 1976 model year, positioned side-by-side on coupes, and stacked vertically on sedans. Sedans received a taller, more-formal grille, while coupes got an angled, body-colored front end along with new bodyside sheet metal that lacked the traditional &quot;sweepspear&quot;. The Gran Sport option was discontinued with the 455 engines and only 231 V6 or 350 V8 were available on the last 1,288 made vehicles merely with appearance and suspension option package.
Buick Centuries were used in the 1975 and 1976 Indianapolis Motor Speedway as pace cars. Buick introduced a 1975 Buick Century &quot;Free Spirit&quot; edition replica based on the Indy Pace Car for the public with patriotic graphic decals and the Buick Hawk on the hood. This 1975 vehicle had a transmission shifter on the floor with bucket seats and &quot;Hurst Hatch&quot; T-tops installed. The white exterior and blue/white interior were based on the 1975 two-door sheet metal. The engine was a 350 V8, as opposed to the 455 V8 used on the actual Indy 500 Pace Car. Alternatively, in 1976, Buick introduced the &quot;Free Spirit&quot; edition of the Indy Pace Car; it was downsized to the 1976 Special facelift sheet metal with a 231 V6. The original Indy Pace Car had the turbocharged 231 V6. The replica featured a silver, black, and red paint with a black interior. The vehicle included a positive-traction differential.

To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States, the standard colors available on all Buicks were Judicial Black, Liberty White, Pewter Gray, Potomac Blue, Continental Blue, Concord Green, Constitution Green, Mount Vernon Cream, Buckskin Tan, Musket Brown, Boston Red and Independence Red, with specially available colors on select models Congressional Cream, Revere Red, Colonial Yellow and Firecracker Orange.

In 1977, the V6 engine was revised to be even-firing, and a Oldsmobile V8 was added as an option for station wagons.

==Fourth generation (1978–1981)==

GM downsized its intermediate line, reducing wheelbase by and curb weight by nearly half a ton. The Century was initially offered as an &quot;aeroback&quot; fastback two-door coupe and a fastback four-door sedan along with a station wagon model (sharing bodies with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon). The car was over a foot shorter, several inches narrower, and several hundred pounds lighter than its predecessor. Big-block engines were discontinued and the new base powerplant was Buick&#x27;s new V6 introduced specifically for the Century and Regal. The V6 and the Chevrolet 305 V8 were options. The Pontiac and replaced the Chevrolet engine for 1979.

One of the more rare models of this time was the 1979 to 1980 Century Turbo Coupe, powered by a turbocharged version of the 3.8 L V6, which offered V8-like performance with more reasonable fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The Turbo Coupe was not nearly as popular as the similar Regal Turbo Sport Coupe of the time, and total production is estimated to be less than 2,500.

The two fastback models (along with the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon) proved unpopular. For 1980, the fastback four-door sedan was dropped in favor of a conventional notchback four-door sedan. After 1980, the Century fastback coupe was discontinued. With the introduction of the new front-wheel drive Century in 1982, the existing notchback sedan and wagon models were transferred to the Regal line.

== Fifth generation (1982–1996)==

In January 1982, GM debuted the downsized fifth generation Century, using the front-wheel drive A platform, in coupe and sedan forms.

The fifth generation Century shared the front-wheel drive A platform with the Cutlass Ciera, Pontiac 6000 and Chevrolet Celebrity, and together the A-bodies became enormously popular — as well as synonymous with GM&#x27;s most transparent examples of badge engineering, highlighted almost indistinguishably on the August 22, 1983 cover of Fortune magazine as examples of genericized uniformity, embarrassing the company and ultimately prompting GM to recommit to design leadership.

In October 1983, a station wagon was added to the lineup to replace the discontinued Regal wagon. The 1984 model year also had an Olympic version of the Buick Century, commemorating the 1984 games in Los Angeles, California. In 1985, all 1986 versions were &quot;freshened&quot; with a new, more angular front fascia. Wheelbase was , with overall length. Both four-cylinder gasoline units and diesel V6 engines were offered in this generation, although neither became popular. Performance versions of several Buick models, including the Century coupe, were marketed in the mid-1980s under the T-Type name. With Buick&#x27;s 181 cu in (3.0 L) V6 producing , the Century T-Type&#x27;s performance was modest, but the Buick 3.8 V6 SFI engine, producing , offered performance in this comparatively lightweight vehicle.

For 1985 and 1986, Hess &amp; Eisenhardt/Car Craft of Lima, Ohio converted 124 finished Buick Century coupes into coachbuilt convertibles. Although these convertibles were sold as new cars through Buick dealerships, these conversions were not factory authorized. In 1986, the engine distributor was replaced by a coil-pack ignition system that proved to be far more reliable than the system that it replaced. The &quot;Chevrolet Century&quot; were sold in South America and the Caribbean. In Mexico, it was sold as the Century Limited (with no brand, although it wears the Buick logos). Introduced for 1984, it was the top model for General Motors Mexico, and it survived the import car wave from 1991 (previously new car importations were forbidden in Mexico) and continued in production until the 1996 model year. In Japan it was sold as the Buick Regal because of the Toyota Century limousine.

The Century received a facelift in late 1988 for the 1989 model year, gaining a new more-rounded roofline, but continuing on the A-body platform. Black plastic inserts with the Buick tri-shield emblem replaced the rear quarter windows. The front end received flush headlamps and a rounded grille, and the stand-up hood ornament was now standard. All sedan models were easily distinguished by their full-width taillights that followed a Buick tradition of big taillights. The 3300 was introduced in 1989 as a replacement for the 3800 cc engine, offering an increase of 10 horsepower, but a loss of 15 lb-ft of torque. The smaller engine featured multiport fuel injection, waste spark distributor-less ignition controlled by the ECM after startup, but had no balance shaft. An interior refresh came in 1989 for 1990 models.

The 1989 model had seatbelts mounted on the b-pillar, for 1990-1996 the seatbelts were mounted on the door. From 1989 to 1992, the Century had a black bumper and side trim, and from 1993 to 1996 the Century had a bodycolored trim.

Originally for 1990, the Century, as with the rest of the A-body range, was intended to be phased out in favor of the more modern W-body line of midsized cars. However, the Century, as well as its sister the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, continued to remain popular nearing the end of their initial runs. Thus, it was decided that the older Century and Cutlass Ciera would instead continue production alongside their proposed replacements, the Regal and Cutlass Supreme respectively, as lower priced alternatives.

===1991 facelift===
For the 1991 model year, the Century received another slight facelift featuring a bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. The interior featured new door panels with the window switches and door lock switches relocated to a more convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. This feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the driver&#x27;s door window. The Century windows switches were not backlit, but illuminated by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A-pillar into the door, functioning as &quot;automatic&quot; seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and the door opened and closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.

For 1993, the 2.5 L I4 was replaced with a new 115 hp 2.2 I4. For 1994, the slow-selling coupe model was dropped (603 sold for 1993, or 0.5% of overall Century sales), and all models received a standard driver&#x27;s-side airbag. Also in 1993, the 3.3 L Buick V6 was replaced with a 3.1 L V6 with the same power rating, and power on the 2.2 L I4 was up to with the introduction of MFI. Midway through the 1994 model year, a round speedometer replaced the wide rectangular one, but the car still carried on with the original dash.

Despite its dated design, the Century and its sibling the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera still sold well during the 1990s and proved both reliable and profitable to GM since their tooling costs had been monetized.

==Sixth generation (1997–2005)==


For the 1997 model year, Buick released the sixth-generation Century (in December 1996, nearly 15 years after its last redesign). Joining the newly redesigned Regal on the W-body chassis, the Century continued its image of traditional entry-level luxury. While sharing a chassis and nearly identical bodywork with its counterpart (with the exception of its standard steel wheels, the Century was styled with a more upright grille than the Regal), the Century featured less powerful engines and softer suspension tuning. In further contrast to the Regal, the Century was fitted with a full-width bench seat and a column shifter (bucket seats and a console were optional); in place of full instrumentation, the dashboard lacked a tachometer. 

Offered solely as a four-door sedan (the Century Estate station wagon was discontinued), the Century carried over the standard &quot;Custom&quot; and upgraded &quot;Limited&quot; trims from the previous generation. Following the retirement of the Skylark, the Century became the entry-level line for the entire Buick brand for 1999. 

For 2003, the Century underwent some revision, as both trim lines were consolidated into an unnamed model. A slight de-contenting of the model line began, with many Limited-trim features (antilock brakes, OnStar, side airbags, rear window antenna, cassette player) became optional, with the &quot;Century&quot; nameplate on the doors deleted (remaining only on the taillamps). 

For 2005, a Special Edition option package included dual-zone automatic climate control, 16-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels, touring tires, anti-lock brakes, a chrome grille with revised tri-shield and a rear Special Edition emblem. Only four exterior colors were offered with the Special Edition option package, Sterling Silver Metallic, Cashmere Metallic, Cardinal Red Metallic and Glacier Blue Metallic.

For 2005, the Buick LaCrosse was introduced to replace both the Century and the Regal on the W-body platform. After outliving the Regal by a model year, the final Buick Century was assembled at Oshawa Car Assembly on October 25, 2004.

=== China ===

The Buick Century was produced in China as the New Century from 1998 to 2000. The engine was the 3.0 liter &quot;LW9&quot; V6 engine which was also used in the first-generation Buick GL8. A four-cylinder model was also available paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. The Century was replaced by the Buick Regal due to poor sales.

After the discontinuation of the model in 2000, the New Century name was used as a trim level of the Buick Regal, sold until at least 2005.

<text>Antitranspirants are compounds applied to the leaves of plants to reduce transpiration. They are used on Christmas trees, on cut flowers, on newly transplanted shrubs, and in other applications to preserve and protect plants from drying out too quickly. They have also been used to protect leaves from salt burn and fungal diseases .

They block the active excretion of hydrogen cation from the guard cells. Due to presence of carbon dioxide, a rapid acidification of cytoplasm takes place leading to stomatal closure. Milbarrow (1974) has described the formation of these chemicals in the chloroplast. It moves to the stomata, where it is responsible for checking the intake of Potassium ion or induces loss of potassium ion from the guard cells.

Antitranspirants are of two types: metabolic inhibitors and film-forming antitranspirants.

Metabolic inhibitors reduce the stomatal opening and increase the leaf resistance to water vapour diffusion without affecting carbon dioxide uptake. Examples include phenylmercury acetate, abscisic acid (ABA), and aspirin.

Film-forming antitranspirants form a colorless film on the leaf surface that allows diffusion of gases but not of water vapour. Examples include silicone oil, waxes.

<text>Patterns of Global Terrorism was a report published each year on or before April 30 by the United States Department of State. It has since been renamed Country Reports on Terrorism. The Secretary of State is required by Congress to produce detailed assessments about 
*each foreign country in which acts of international terrorism occurred;
*the extent to which foreign countries are cooperating with the U.S. in the apprehension, conviction, and punishment of terrorists;
*the extent to which foreign countries are cooperating with the U.S. in the prevention of further acts of terrorism; and
*activities of any terrorist group known to be responsible for the kidnapping or death of an American citizen.

The exact definition of the requirements are in Title 22, Section 2656f of the United States Code.

The only complete print edition—indexed, updated, and supplemented with maps and tables, 1985-2005—was published by Berkshire Publishing Group in 2005.

==Summaries==

Each report includes a short numerical summary. The table at right summarizes the number of international terrorism acts reported each year since 1995. The numbers of those killed or wounded from those acts are also included in the table.

The following list consists of the report excerpts from which the table is based. Note that some of the numbers are revised after initial publication of the report, which causes some of the numbers used in excerpted comparisons to differ from what was originally reported.
* 2004: The report is no longer published to the public after its methodology was challenged by the Bush-Cheney administration, amid claims that it showed the highest amount of terror activity in its nineteen-year history. A new report was created, called the Country Reports on Terrorism, which detailed terrorism by region but offered no statistics or chronology. In a press conference, the State Department said 1,907 people had been killed and 9,300 wounded in terrorist attacks, the highest ever. A chronology of terror events was released by the National Counterterrorism Center (which can be read here)
* 2003: There were 208 acts of international terrorism in 2003, a slight increase from the most recently published figure of 198 attacks in 2002, and a 42% drop from the level in 2001 of 355 attacks. 625 persons were killed in the attacks of 2003, fewer than the 725 killed during 2002. 3646 persons were wounded in the attacks that occurred in 2003, a sharp increase from 2013 persons wounded the year before. This increase reflects the numerous indiscriminate attacks during 2003 on “soft targets,” such as places of worship, hotels, and commercial districts, intended to produce mass casualties.
* 2002: International terrorists conducted 199 attacks in 2002, a significant drop (44%) from the 355 attacks recorded during 2001. 725 persons were killed in last year’s attacks, far fewer than the 3,295 persons killed the previous year, which included the thousands of fatalities resulting from the September 11 attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. 2,013 persons were wounded by terrorists in 2002, down from the 2,283 persons wounded the year before.
* 2001: Despite the events of September 11, the number of international terrorist attacks in 2001 declined to 346, down from 426 the previous year. One hundred seventy-eight of the attacks were bombings against a multinational oil pipeline in Colombia — constituting 51% of the year’s total number of attacks. In 2000, there were 152 pipeline bombings in Colombia, which accounted for 40% of the total. 3,547 persons were killed in international terrorist attacks in 2001, the highest annual death toll from terrorism ever recorded. Ninety percent of the fatalities occurred in the September 11 attacks. The number of persons wounded in terrorist attacks in 2001 was 1080, up from 796 wounded the previous year. Violence in the Middle East and South Asia also accounted for the increase in casualty totals for 2001.
* 2000: There were 423 international terrorist attacks in 2000, an increase of 8% from the 392 attacks recorded during 1999. The main reason for the increase was an upsurge in the number of bombings of a multinational oil pipeline in Colombia by two terrorist groups there. The pipeline was bombed 152 times, producing in the Latin American region the largest increase in terrorist attacks from the previous year, from 121 to 193. The number of casualties caused by terrorists also increased in 2000. During the year, 405 persons were killed and 791 were wounded, up from the 1999 totals of 233 dead and 706 wounded.
* 1999: The number of persons killed or wounded in international terrorist attacks during 1999 fell sharply because of the absence of any attack causing mass casualties. In 1999, 233 persons were killed and 706 were wounded, as compared with 741 persons killed and 5,952 wounded in 1998. The number of terrorist attacks rose, however. During 1999, 392 international terrorist attacks occurred, up 43% from the 274 attacks recorded the previous year. The number of attacks increased in every region of the world except in the Middle East, where six fewer attacks occurred.
* 1998: There were 273 international terrorist attacks during 1998, a drop from the 304 attacks we recorded the previous year and the lowest annual total since 1971. The total number of persons killed or wounded in terrorist attacks, however, was the highest on record: 741 persons died, and 5,952 persons suffered injuries.
* 1997: During 1997 there were 304 acts of international terrorism, eight more than occurred during 1996, but one of the lowest annual totals recorded since 1971. The number of casualties remained large but did not approach the high levels recorded during 1996. In 1997, 221 persons died and 693 were wounded in international terrorist attacks as compared to 314 dead and 2,912 wounded in 1996. Seven US citizens died and 21 were wounded in 1997, as compared with 23 dead and 510 wounded the previous year.
* 1996: During 1996 there were 296 acts of international terrorism, the lowest annual total in 25 years and 144 fewer than in 1995. In contrast, the total number of casualties was one of the highest ever recorded: 311 persons killed and 2,652 wounded. A single bombing in Sri Lanka killed 90 persons and wounded more than 1,400 others.
* 1995: In most countries, the level of international terrorism in 1995 continued the downward trend of recent years, and there were fewer terrorist acts that caused deaths last year than in the previous year. However, the total number of international terrorist acts rose in 1995 from 322 to 440, largely because of a major increase in nonlethal terrorist attacks against property in Germany and in Turkey by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The total number of fatalities from international terrorism worldwide declined from 314 in 1994 to 165 in 1995, but the number of persons wounded increased by a factor of ten to 6,291 persons; 5,500 were injured in a gas attack in the Tokyo subway system in March.

==Problems with 2003 report==
The 2003 report was released twice, in April and June 2004. The release of the April 29th version led Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage to say 
:Terrorism continues to destroy the lives of people all over the world; and this report we are releasing today, &quot;Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2003,&quot; documents the sad toll that such attacks took last year. This report also details the steps the United States and some 92 other nations took in 19 — or 2003 to fight back and to protect our peoples. Indeed, you will find in these pages clear evidence that we are prevailing in the fight.

On June 10, 2004, a few weeks after challenges from two professors (Alan Krueger of Princeton University and David Laitin of Stanford University) and Congressman Henry Waxman, the State Department announced that the report previously issued for 2003 was incomplete and incorrect in part. The revisions issued twelve days later included significant changes, including a doubling of the number of killed and wounded mentioned in the April 2004 version. Here are examples from the section &quot;The Year in Review&quot;:

In November 2004, news leaked to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about an internal report from the State Department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General. The report found more errors in the 2003 report, and concluded that even the June version &quot;cannot be viewed as reliable&quot; because of questionable statistics on terrorist attacks and casualties, as well as other issues. The inspectors cited some short-term problems from the transition to the government&#x27;s new interagency Terrorist Threat Integration Center. These included gaps in data entry, inadequate oversight, and personnel issues. They also cited a long-standing failure by the State Department, CIA, and other agencies to use consistent standards for the identification and classification of terrorism-related events.

<doc id="718521" wikidata="Q693442" url="?curid=718521" title="Subarachnoid hemorrhage">
<text>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid space—the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, weakness, numbness, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.
SAH may occur as a result of a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases include high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours of symptom onset. Occasionally, a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.
Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or endovascular coiling. Medications such as labetalol may be required to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. The routine use of medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. Between ten and fifteen percent die before reaching a hospital.
Spontaneous SAH occurs in about one per 10,000 people per year. Females are more commonly affected than males. While it becomes more common with age, about 50% of people present under 55 years old. It is a form of stroke and comprises about 5 percent of all strokes. Surgery for aneurysms was introduced in the 1930s. Since the 1990s many aneurysms are treated by a less invasive procedure called endovascular coiling, which is carried out through a large blood vessel.

A true subarachnoid hemorrhage may be confused with a pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage, an apparent increased attenuation on CT scans within the basal cisterns that mimics a true subarachnoid hemorrhage. This occurs in cases of severe cerebral edema, such as by cerebral hypoxia. It may also occur due to intrathecally administered contrast material, leakage of high-dose intravenous contrast material into the subarachnoid spaces, or in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, severe meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, intracranial hypotension, cerebellar infarctions, or bilateral subdural hematomas.

==Signs and symptoms==
The classic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage is thunderclap headache (a headache described as &quot;like being kicked in the head&quot;, or the &quot;worst ever&quot;, developing over seconds to minutes). This headache often pulsates towards the occiput (the back of the head). About one-third of people have no symptoms apart from the characteristic headache, and about one in ten people who seek medical care with this symptom are later diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vomiting may be present, and 1 in 14 have seizures. Confusion, decreased level of consciousness or coma may be present, as may neck stiffness and other signs of meningism.

Neck stiffness usually presents six hours after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil and loss of the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result of rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.

Oculomotor nerve abnormalities (affected eye looking downward and outward and inability to lift the eyelid on the same side) or palsy (loss of movement) may indicate bleeding from the posterior communicating artery. Seizures are more common if the hemorrhage is from an aneurysm; it is otherwise difficult to predict the site and origin of the hemorrhage from the symptoms. SAH in a person known to have seizures is often diagnostic of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation.

The combination of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure (if present) leads to a &quot;sympathetic surge&quot;, i.e. over-activation of the sympathetic system. This is thought to occur through two mechanisms, a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the peripheral circulation where they activate the sympathetic system. As a consequence of the sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure; mediated by increased contractility of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance. The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden, severe, and are frequently life-threatening. The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm), electrocardiographic changes (in 27 percent of cases) and cardiac arrest (in 3 percent of cases) may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage. A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema, where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces, the alveoli, of the lung.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage may also occur in people who have had a head injury. Symptoms may include headache, decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body). SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.

While thunderclap headache is the characteristic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage, less than 10% of those with concerning symptoms have SAH on investigations. A number of other causes may need to be considered.

==Causes==

Most cases of SAH are due to trauma such as a blow to the head. Traumatic SAH usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It often happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury. In these cases prognosis is poorer; however, it is unclear if this is a direct result of the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of a more severe head injury.

In 85 percent of spontaneous cases the cause is a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall of one of the arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.

In 15–20 percent of cases of spontaneous SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood is limited to the subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors.

Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.

==Pathophysiology==
Cerebral vasospasm is one of the complications caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. It usually happens from the third day after the aneurysm event, and reaches its peak on 5th to 7th day. There are several mechanisms proposed for this complication. Blood products released from subarachnoid hemorrhage stimulates the tyrosine kinase pathway causing the release of calcium ions from intracellular storage, resulting in smooth muscle contraction of cerebral arteries. Oxyhaemoglobin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causes vasoconstriction by increasing free radicals, endothelin-1, prostaglandin and reducing the level of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Besides, the disturbances of autonomic nervous system innervating cerebral arteries is also thought to cause vasospasm.

==Diagnosis==

As only 10 percent of people admitted to the emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an SAH, other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously, such as meningitis, migraine, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage, in which bleeding occurs within the brain itself, is twice as common as SAH and is often misdiagnosed as the latter. It is not unusual for SAH to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or tension headache, which can lead to a delay in obtaining a CT scan. In a 2004 study, this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status. The delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome. In some people, the headache resolves by itself, and no other symptoms are present. This type of headache is referred to as &quot;sentinel headache&quot;, because it is presumed to result from a small leak (a &quot;warning leak&quot;) from an aneurysm. A sentinel headache still warrants investigations with CT scan and lumbar puncture, as further bleeding may occur in the subsequent three weeks.

The initial steps for evaluating a person with a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot be made on clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.

===Imaging===
The modality of choice is computed tomography (CT scan), without contrast, of the brain. This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify 98.7% of cases within six hours of the onset of symptoms. A CT scan can rule out the diagnosis in someone with a normal neurological exam if done within six hours. Its efficacy declines thereafter, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT after several days.

====Angiography====
After a subarachnoid hemorrhage is confirmed, its origin needs to be determined. If the bleeding is likely to have originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).

In emergency department patients complaining of acute-onset headache without significant risk factors for SAH, evidence suggests that CT scanning of the head followed by CT angiography can reliably exclude SAH without the need for a lumbar puncture. The risk of missing an aneurysmal bleed as the cause of SAH with this approach is less than 1%.

===Lumbar puncture===

Lumbar puncture, in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed from the subarachnoid space of the spinal canal using a hypodermic needle, shows evidence of bleeding in three percent of people in whom a non-contrast CT was found normal. A lumbar puncture or CT scan with contrast is therefore regarded as mandatory in people with suspected SAH when imaging is delayed to after six hours from the onset of symptoms and is negative. At least three tubes of CSF are collected. If an elevated number of red blood cells is present equally in all bottles, this indicates a subarachnoid hemorrhage. If the number of cells decreases per bottle, it is more likely that it is due to damage to a small blood vessel during the procedure (known as a &quot;traumatic tap&quot;). While there is no official cutoff for red blood cells in the CSF no documented cases have occurred at less than &quot;a few hundred cells&quot; per high-powered field.

The CSF sample is also examined for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid. This can be determined by spectrophotometry (measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light) or visual examination. It is unclear which method is superior. Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12 hours between the onset of the headache and lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.

===ECG===
Electrocardiographic changes are relatively common in subarachnoid hemorrhage, occurring in 40–70 percent of cases. They may include QT prolongation, Q waves, cardiac dysrhythmias, and ST elevation that mimics a heart attack. 

Also one of the characteristic ECG changes that could be found in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, is the J waves or Osborn waves, which are positive deflections that occur at the junction between QRS complexes and ST segments, where the S point, also known as the J point, has a myocardial infarction-like elevation. J waves or Osborn waves, which represent an early repolarization and delayed depolarization of the heart ventricles, are thought to be caused by the high catecholamines surge released in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or brain damage, the issue that might lead to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest in unmanaged patients.

===Classification===
There are several grading scales available for SAH. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is ubiquitously used for assessing consciousness. Its three specialized scores are used to evaluate SAH; in each, a higher number is associated with a worse outcome. These scales have been derived by retrospectively matching characteristics of people with their outcomes.

The first widely used scale for neurological condition following SAH was published by Botterell and Cannell in 1956 and referred to as the Botterell Grading Scale. This was modified by Hunt and Hess in 1968:

The Fisher Grade classifies the appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan.

This scale has been modified by Claassen and coworkers, reflecting the additive risk from SAH size and accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage (0 – none; 1 – minimal SAH w/o IVH; 2 – minimal SAH with IVH; 3 – thick SAH w/o IVH; 4 – thick SAH with IVH);.

The World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) classification uses Glasgow coma score and focal neurological deficit to gauge severity of symptoms.
A comprehensive classification scheme has been suggested by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy. The system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for the presence or absence of each of five factors: age greater than 50; Hunt and Hess grade 4 or 5; Fisher scale 3 or 4; aneurysm size greater than 10 mm; and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more.

==Screening and prevention==
Screening for aneurysms is not performed on a population level; because they are relatively rare, it would not be cost-effective. However, if someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, is known to be associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.

An aneurysm may be detected incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated with potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH were more likely to bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10 mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. Moreover, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.

==Treatment==
Management involves general measures to stabilize the person while also using specific investigations and treatments. These include the prevention of rebleeding by obliterating the bleeding source, prevention of a phenomenon known as vasospasm, and prevention and treatment of complications.

Stabilizing the person is the first priority. Those with a depressed level of consciousness may need to be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.

People with poor clinical grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for the placement of an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.

===Preventing rebleeding===

Efforts to keep a person&#x27;s systolic blood pressure somewhere between 140 and 160 mmHg is generally recommended. Medications to achieve this may include labetalol or nicardipine.

People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, depressed level of consciousness, or focal neurologic signs may benefit from urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen at any time and carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24 hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent four weeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm &gt;10 mm in size.

If a cerebral aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures are available to reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.

In general, the decision between clipping and coiling is made on the basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10 mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the &quot;anterior circulation&quot;), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the &quot;International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial&quot; (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.

===Vasospasm===
Vasospasm, in which the blood vessels constrict and thus restrict blood flow, is a serious complication of SAH. It can cause ischemic brain injury (referred to as &quot;delayed ischemia&quot;) and permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen in parts of the brain. It can be fatal if severe. Delayed ischemia is characterized by new neurological symptoms, and can be confirmed by transcranial doppler or cerebral angiography. About one third of people admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will have delayed ischemia, and half of those have permanent damage as a result. It is possible to screen for the development of vasospasm with transcranial Doppler every 24–48 hours. A blood flow velocity of more than 120 centimeters per second is suggestive of vasospasm.

The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage is attributed to the higher levels of endothelin 1, a potent vasoconstrictor, and the lower levels of endothelial NOS (eNOS), a potent vasodilator. Both of which are produced from a series of events that begin from the inflammatory reaction caused by the products released from erythrocytes&#x27; degradation. Following subarachnoid hemorrhage, different clotting factors and blood products are released into the surrounding perivascular spaces known as (Virchow-Robin spaces). The released clotting factors like; fibrinopeptides, thromboxane A2 and others lead to microthrombosis around near vessels that leads to extrinsic vasoconstriction of these vessels. Besides that extrinsic vasoconstriction, the erythrocytes&#x27; degradation products like; bilirubin and oxyhemoglobin lead to neuroinflammation that in turn increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which increases and decreases the production of endothelin 1 and endothelial NOS, respectively, the issue that yields in intrinsic vasoconstriction of the neighboring blood vessels and results in cerebral ischemia if left untreated.

The use of calcium channel blockers, thought to be able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by preventing calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. It is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for treating cerebral vasospasm. In &quot;traumatic&quot; subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.

Nimodipine is readily authorized in the form of tablets and solution for infusion for the prevention and treatment of complications due to vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Another sustained formulation of nimodipine administered via an external ventricular drain (EVD), called EG-1962, is also available. In contrast to the tablets and solution formulations of Nimodipine which require an administration every 4hrs for a total of 21 days, the sustained formulation, EG-1962, needs to be administered once directly into the ventricles. The CSF concentrations from EG-1962, however, were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those with oral nimodipine. These results supported a phase 3 study that demonstrated a favorable safety profile for EG-1962 but yielded inconclusive efficacy results due to notable differences in clinical outcome based on baseline disease severity. 

Some older studies have suggested that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a subsequent meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity may help prevent vasospasm their use does not appear to change outcomes.
A protocol referred to as &quot;triple H&quot; is often used as a measure to treat vasospasm when it causes symptoms; this is the use of intravenous fluids to achieve a state of hypertension (high blood pressure), hypervolemia (excess fluid in the circulation), and hemodilution (mild dilution of the blood). Evidence for this approach is inconclusive; no randomized controlled trials have been undertaken to demonstrate its effect.

If the symptoms of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) directly into the artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.

===Other complications===
Hydrocephalus (obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person&#x27;s condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.

People have often been treated with preventative antiepileptic medications. This is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications was associated with a worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.

==Prognosis==

===Short-term outcomes===
SAH is often associated with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighth day of admission.

So-called &quot;angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, SAH that does not show an aneurysm with four-vessel angiography, carries a better prognosis than SAH with aneurysm, but it is still associated with a risk of ischemia, rebleeding, and hydrocephalus. Perimesencephalic SAH (bleeding around the mesencephalon in the brain), however, has a very low rate of rebleeding or delayed ischemia, and the prognosis of this subtype is excellent.

The prognosis of head trauma is thought to be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. More than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.

There is also modest evidence that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH. For example, having two copies of ApoE4 (a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also plays a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome. The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.

===Long-term outcomes===

Neurocognitive symptoms, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and other related symptoms, are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 percent of people who have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that play a central role in hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic–pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone). SAH is also associated with SIADH and cerebral salt wasting, and is the most common cause of the latter.

==Epidemiology==

According to a review of 51 studies from 21 countries, the average incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9.1 per 100,000 annually. Studies from Japan and Finland show higher rates in those countries (22.7 and 19.7, respectively), for reasons that are not entirely understood. South and Central America, in contrast, have a rate of 4.2 per 100,000 on average.

Although the group of people at risk for SAH is younger than the population usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.

Genetics may play a role in a person&#x27;s disposition to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. But lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.

Overall, about 1 percent of all people have one or more cerebral aneurysms. Most of these are small and unlikely to rupture.

==History==
While the clinical picture of subarachnoid hemorrhage may have been recognized by Hippocrates, the existence of cerebral aneurysms and the fact that they could rupture was not established until the 18th century. The associated symptoms were described in more detail in 1886 by Edinburgh physician Dr Byrom Bramwell. In 1924, London neurologist Sir Charles P. Symonds (1890–1978) gave a complete account of all major symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and he coined the term &quot;spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;. Symonds also described the use of lumbar puncture and xanthochromia in diagnosis.

The first surgical intervention was performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer in the use of angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.

<doc id="718522" wikidata="Q286468" url="?curid=718522" title="Al-Ahram">
<text>Al-Ahram (; ), founded on 5 August 1876, is the most widely circulating Egyptian daily newspaper, and the second-oldest after &quot;Al-Waqa&#x27;i&#x27; al-Misriyya&quot; (&quot;The Egyptian Events&quot;, founded 1828). It is majority owned by the Egyptian government, and is considered a newspaper of record for Egypt.

Given the many varieties of Arabic language, &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; is widely considered an influential source of writing style in Arabic. In 1950, the Middle East Institute described &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; as being to the Arabic-reading public within its area of distribution, &quot;What &quot;The Times&quot; is to Englishmen and &quot;The New York Times&quot; to Americans&quot;; however, it has often been accused of heavy influence and censorship by the Egyptian government.

In addition to the main edition published in Egypt, the paper publishes two other Arabic-language editions, one geared to the Arab world and the other aimed at an international audience, as well as editions in English and French.

==History==
&quot;Al-Ahram&quot; was founded in Alexandria in 1876 by two Ottoman Melkite Christian brothers, and Saleem Takla. It began as a weekly newspaper published every Saturday. Its first issue appeared on 5 August 1876. The paper was relaunched as a daily newspaper in January 1881.

Its headquarters was in Alexandria until November 1899 when it was moved to Cairo. Initially the Cairo and Alexandria editions remained separate but later there became only one out of the new headquarters. The newspaper was distributed in Egypt and the Levant. The religious innovators Muhammad Abduh and Jamal al-Din al-Afghani were early writers of the newspaper. Upon the death of Beshara Takla, Daud Barakat, a Lebanese journalist, was named editor of the daily in 1901. In the early 1920s Muhib Al Din Al Khatib, a Syrian journalist, served as the editor of the paper.

=== Under Heikal ===
President Gamal Abdel Nasser made his friend Mohamed Hassanein Heikal editor-in-chief of &quot;al-Ahram&quot; in 1957, and the paper gained semi-official status. On 24 May 1960, it was nationalized when Nasser passed a law eliminating the ownership of private newspapers. Under Nasser, &quot;al-Ahram&quot; became an internationally respected paper. It moved to a new headquarters in Bulaq in the 1960s.

Heikal was known for high standard of production quality and contacted Linotype in 1965 seeking to acquire state-of-the-art Elektron linecastes.

The circulation of the paper was between 45,000 and 50,000 copies in 1937 whereas it was 90,000 copies in 1947. In 1976 the paper had a circulation of 520,000 copies, making it the second-most read daily in Egypt after &quot;Al Akhbar&quot;. &quot;Al Ahram&quot;&#x27;s circulation in 2000 was 1.2 million copies.

==Profile and editions==
&quot;Al-Ahram&quot; daily is the flagship of what is now the Al-Ahram publishing house, the largest in Egypt. &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;&#x27;s headquarters is in Boulaq, Cairo. Its content was controlled by the Egyptian Ministry of Information.

The pan-Arab Arabic-language edition of the paper, called &quot;Al Ahram Al Arabiya&quot;, is destined for readers in the Arab World and the Egyptian expatriates in Arab countries. It is published daily in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE and distributed in Egypt and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Arabic weekly, &quot;Al Ahram Al Arabi&quot;, which was launched in 1997 is another publication of the publishing house.

An international Arabic-language edition called &quot;Al Ahram al Duwali&quot; has been published daily in London since 1984. It is printed in both London and Paris and is distributed throughout Europe, USA, Canada and Egypt.

Two foreign-language weekly versions are also produced: the English &quot;Al-Ahram Weekly&quot; (founded in 1991) and the French &quot;Al-Ahram Hebdo&quot;.

&quot;Al-Ahram&quot; produces a continually updated news website in the English language at english.ahram.org.e.g., called Ahram Online. It also has an Arabic news website which was the 20th mostly visited website for 2010 in the MENA region. It was named as the most popular news portal in the Arab world in the period from 31 August 2011 to 31 August 2012 by &quot;Forbes Middle East&quot;.

==Ownership and government influence==
&quot;Al-Ahram&quot; is owned by the Al-Ahram Foundation which is managed by the Egyptian government&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Council of Press&quot;. &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; is one of the largest circulating newspapers in the world. Long-term editor of the daily Mohammad Hassanein Haykal was the confidant of Nasser and also, the semi-official voice of the Egyptian government when he was in office.

The Egyptian government owns a controlling share of the stocks of the paper and appoints the editors. As appointees of the state, little censorship is exercised over them; it is understood that they are loyal to the state. Under President Hosni Mubarak, &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; largely ignored, and trivialised the opposition parties to Mubarak&#x27;s ruling National Democratic Party, and did not publish much direct criticism of the government.

The Anti-Defamation League, in a review of Arab newspapers in 2005, stated that &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; &quot;is given substantial leeway&quot; by the government so long as they avoid &quot;certain &#x27;taboos&#x27;.&quot; Reporters Without Borders, in their 2005 report on press freedom in Egypt, reported that editorials in many newspapers, including &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;, had become increasingly critical of the National Democratic Party&#x27;s control of the government, and the corruption of the Mubarak regime. In an interview with Reporters Without Borders, Abdel Halim Qandil, editor of the weekly magazine &quot;Al-Arabi&quot;, said that the government interfered with independent operation of &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; by controlling the printing presses and appointing the editors.

&quot;Al-Ahram&quot; generated controversy in September 2010 when an Egyptian blogger, Wael Khalil, revealed that the newspaper had altered a photo of Middle East leaders walking with United States president Barack Obama so that instead of Obama leading the group, Egyptian president Mubarak was placed in the front when he was actually walking in the rearmost position. Osama Saraya, &quot;Al-Ahram&#x27;s&quot; editor-in-chief, defended the altered photo, stating that it was meant to underscore Egypt&#x27;s leading role in the peace process: &quot;The expressionist photo is... a brief, live and true expression of the prominent stance of President Mubarak in the Palestinian issue, his unique role in leading it before Washington or any other.&quot;

==Notable writers and editors==
Mohamed Hassanein Heikal was the long-term editor-in-chief of &quot;Al Ahram&quot;. He served in the post between August 1957 and 1974. Ali Amin served as editor-in-chief between 1974 and 1976. From 1978 to July 2006 Ibrahim Nafie was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Al Ahram&quot;. He also served as the chairman of the daily until 2005. Nafie was replaced by Osama Saraya as editor-in-chief in July 2005. In August 2012, Abdel Nasser Salama was appointed editor-in-chief of the paper by the Egyptian Shura Council. in May 2017 Alaa Thabet became the editor-in-chief of the paper.

<doc id="718530" wikidata="Q2737559" url="?curid=718530" title="Terra (character)">
<text>Terra is the name used by three fictional superheroines published by DC Comics. The first Terra, Tara Markov, is an antiheroine eventually revealed to actually be a supervillainess working as a double agent. She was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, and debuted in &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #26 (December 1982).

The second Terra, a doppelgänger of Tara Markov, debuted in &quot;New Titans&quot; #79 (September 1991) and was created by Marv Wolfman and Tom Grummett.

The third Terra, Atlee, debuted in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #12 (January 2007) and was created by Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray, and Amanda Conner.

==Publication history==
The character was created with an intended finite life span. Co-creator Pérez stated that he and Marv Wolfman knew, &quot;from the very start, that this girl was going to be a traitor and that we were going to kill this character off.&quot; When creating the look of the character, Pérez noted that:

A new Terra appeared in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #12 while a &quot;Terra&quot; limited series was being developed, written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, with illustrations by Amanda Conner. Gray commented about the series, &quot;Terra as a character has never had a definitive origin. That includes Terra 1 and 2. This mini will address that fact in some surprising ways and open the door to a new corner of the DCU. Aside from that the emphasis will be on heroism, true blue hero stuff.&quot; Palmiotti later stated, &quot;Terra is an enigma for obvious reasons. Every hero in the DCU is in the dark about who she is and why she&#x27;s doing what she&#x27;s doing, which is running around the planet saving and helping people. We&#x27;ve been working with Terra for months and months trying to find and develop what&#x27;s special about her. In the end, it was a very simple angle, make Terra a super&quot;hero&quot; with plenty of emphasis on heroism. Everything she does is to help other people and in the service of life.&quot; The 4-issue miniseries was temporarily shelved for a number of reasons, until its biweekly publication spanning November and December 2008. The new Terra previously appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 3 #52–54 as part of &quot;The Titans of Tomorrow...Today!&quot; storyline and in the first issue of the &quot;Terror Titans&quot; limited series. Following this, she briefly appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 3 #69 in the climax of the recruitment drive storyline, and became a supporting character in the ongoing &quot;Power Girl&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Tara Markov===
Tara Markov is the half-sister of Brion Markov (Geo-Force) and the illegitimate daughter of Markovian king Viktor. Helga Jace, a scientist who works for Markovia&#x27;s royal family, gives Tara and Brion powers to help them combat a rebellion in the country. Unlike Brion, Terra has deep-rooted psychological issues and believes that they should rule Earth rather than help the weaker masses.

In &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; storyline, Terra infiltrates the Teen Titans as a double agent on Deathstroke&#x27;s behalf before being killed in battle with the former. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Terra is temporarily resurrected as a Black Lantern before Geo-Force and Halo kill her.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Terra is permanently resurrected and joins Caitlin Fairchild&#x27;s Ravagers. She and Beast Boy meet after being kidnapped and held in the Colony and eventually enter a relationship.

===Tara Markov doppelgänger===
The second Terra is a girl from the underground world of Strata who was transformed into a clone of Tara Markov and joined the Team Titans. After the group&#x27;s native timeline is destroyed during &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, the Time Trapper rescues Terra and Mirage and transports them to the main universe. Following this, Terra joins the Outsiders and assists the Teen Titans in battling Superboy-Prime during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. In &quot;World War III&quot;, Terra is killed by Black Adam.

An alternate timeline variant of Terra appears in &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; as a member of Titans East. 

===Atlee===

A third Terra, Atlee, is introduced in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #12 (January 2007). She is an alien from the underground world Strata, similar to the second Terra.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Terra is among the metahumans who are kidnapped, controlled by the Anti-Life Equation, and forced to battle at the Dark Side Club. After being freed, Terra moves to Manhattan and becomes Power Girl&#x27;s sidekick.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of Terra can manipulate earth and rock. This enables them to generate earthquakes, create shields, and levitate rocks for fast transportation.

===Television===

* The Tara Markov incarnation of Terra appears in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (2003), voiced by Ashley Johnson. This version is more sympathetic and tragic than her comics counterpart and initially displays little control over her powers, the latter trait being a source of shame for her. While on the run due to her powers, she encounters the Teen Titans, during which she confides in Beast Boy her fear of losing control and he develops a crush on her, and Slade, who claims to know everything about her and offers to help her. Agreeing with Slade, she temporarily leaves the Titans to study under him before returning to serve as a double agent and dates Beast Boy until he breaks up with her when she reveals her true allegiance. She helps Slade take over Jump City and seemingly kills the Titans, but develops second thoughts. After Slade betrays her, she overcomes his control, kills him, and sacrifices herself to save Jump City, turning to stone in the process. Sometime later, Beast Boy discovers Terra disappeared and encounters a girl resembling her with no powers or recollection of what happened.
* The Tara Markov incarnation of Terra appears in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; (2013), voiced again by Ashley Johnson. This version is friends with Raven and Starfire.
* Tara Markov appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Tara Strong.

Following this, she was recruited into the League of Shadows under Deathstroke and worked for them as an assassin for two years before allowing the Outsiders to rescue her and serve as a double agent within their ranks. After Artemis appeals to her better nature, Tara defects to the Outsiders.

On the one-year anniversary of her joining them, she and Deathstroke capture most of the Titans and bring them to Brother Blood. After Deathstroke betrays her, Nightwing rescues her and the Titans before she attacks and seemingly kills Deathstroke. Ashamed by her actions, she brings Blood&#x27;s fortress down on herself and dies in Beast Boy&#x27;s arms.

<doc id="718533" wikidata="Q5150189" url="?curid=718533" title="Column 88">
<text>Column 88 was a neo-Nazi paramilitary organisation based in the United Kingdom. It was formed in the early 1970s, and disbanded in the early 1980s. The members of Column 88 undertook military training under the supervision of a former Royal Marine Commando, and also held regular gatherings attended by neo-Nazis from all over Europe. The name is code: the eighth letter of the alphabet &#x27;HH&#x27; represents the Nazi greeting &#x27;Heil Hitler&#x27;. Journalist Martin Walker described Column 88 as a &quot;shadow paramilitary Nazi group&quot;.

==Formation==
A secret Nazi underground group, the origins of Column 88 have been given as early as 1945. Indeed, Gerry Gable has claimed that Colin Jordan was sworn in as a member of this secret society as a nineteen-year-old. According to historian Richard Thurlow, Column 88 took their name from a group of Austrians who set up an underground group of this name in 1934 when the Austrian government banned the Nazi Party.

Open activity, however, did not start until 1970 when it took charge of elements of the National Socialist Group, a secret paramilitary grouping associated with the British Movement. The founders of this more organised group had been followers of Colin Jordan, who had become disillusioned with their former leader after he began to moderate his public utterances in the wake of the 1965 and 1968 Race Relations Acts. One of their major critiques of Jordan was his decision two years earlier to disband the National Socialist Movement in order to establish the British Movement, an action which they interpreted as a retreat from Nazism.

According to one report, &quot;Column 88, was connected with the Gladio networks. These networks were set up after the Second World War, with the support of the US Central Intelligence Agency, by a number of powers, both within and outside NATO as anti-communist resistance bodies&quot;. According to another report, Major Ian Souter Clarence, a former Special Forces Officer, &quot;helped set up Column 88 in the 1960s as the British section of Gladio&quot;.

==Leadership==
The group&#x27;s military commander was Major Ian Souter Clarence, who had served in the Black Watch during the Second World War before becoming active as a supporter of Arnold Leese. Stories about him stockpiling weapons had been known to MI5 from as early as 1946. He organised a number of camps to provide combat training to Column 88 members. One such camp, held in November 1975 in conjunction with the League of St George, was reported in the well known UK anti-fascist &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine where those in attendance included Brian Baldwin, a prison officer from Manchester, and Peter Marriner, the head of the British Movement in Birmingham.
The overall leader however was Leslie Eric Lutz Vaughan, a veteran of the British National Party and its paramilitary wing Spearhead. Vaughan was, according to Ray Hill, close to Anthony Reed Herbert in a professional capacity (Herbert being a lawyer and Vaughan a private investigator) and the work Vaughan put Herbert&#x27;s way ensured that Column 88 played a leading role in Herbert&#x27;s British Democratic Party. Indeed, following a &quot;World in Action&quot; report in 1981 detailing British Democratic Party attempts at gun-running, Vaughan and Column 88 temporarily went into abeyance for fear of becoming implicated. Other leading members included Joe Short, who had been involved in David Myatt&#x27;s National Democratic Freedom Movement, Graham Gillmore, a mercenary and NF member, and David Myatt.

==Activities==
Members of other more open far-right movements were recruited into Column 88&#x27;s ranks, with membership limited to those seen as the most extreme. Indeed, A.K. Chesterton, who had established the National Front, wrote in one of his final letters to John Tyndall expressing his concerns that NF members were becoming involved in Column 88.

In the late 1970s, the organisation allegedly carried out several bomb attacks on left-wing British organisations, including the Socialist Workers Party, the Anti-Nazi League and the left-wing Housmans bookshop, where the pacifist and anti-racist magazine &quot;Peace News&quot; was published. Many suspected that this group were behind the arson attack that destroyed the Albany Empire in Deptford, south London in July 1978 during the Rock Against Racism campaign. Other bomb attacks that it was reported to have carried out included those against targets as diverse as the homes of Conservative Party members and transmission towers whilst the group also claimed a series of arson attacks on Jewish-owned businesses.

Column 88 first came to public attention in 1975, when the regional British newspaper, the Western Daily Press, published accounts of Column 88 members training, in Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, with elements of the Territorial Army. This led to a question being asked, by a Member of Parliament, in the House of Commons, and to other reports in British newspapers, such as The Guardian. The British anti-fascist magazine, &quot;Searchlight&quot;, also published articles about Column 88 in May 1975, and May 1976.

Infiltration of the Army Cadet Force was also organised by Column 88. Column 88 was also said to have been involved in the establishment of a number of other far-right groups, including the exclusive League of St. George and the National Party. National Party leader John Kingsley Read claimed that he received funds from Column 88 both for his own party and during his time as chairman of the National Front. In 1983 Column 88 hit the headlines again when the press reported that Clarence had been &quot;safe-housing&quot; three German neo-Nazis terrorists Odfried Hepp, Ulrich Tillmann and Walter Kexel, who were wanted for bomb attacks on US Army bases in Germany.

<doc id="718543" wikidata="Q103965" url="?curid=718543" title="Padre Burgos, Quezon">
<text>Padre Burgos, officially the Municipality of Padre Burgos (), is a municipality in the province of Quezon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 23,488 people.

The town is notable for its unspoiled beaches and the &quot;Tulay Buhangin&quot; (Tagalog for &quot;sand bridge&quot;). All the population are of Tagalog descent. The economy is primarily based on coconut husking and farming. Local tourism is also on the rise.

==History==

Padre Burgos was formerly known as &quot;Laguimanoc&quot; due to the shape of the coastline which resembles the bill of a chicken, which translates to “manok” in Tagalog. Another version is that chickens were so abundant in the town that hawks (Tagalog: “lawin”) swept down on the place to snatch chicks from their mothers. When hawks flew overhead, as warning to their neighborhood, people shouted “Hawk Manok” or “Lawin-Manok”.

On January 1, 1917, the village of Laguimanoc, which was formerly a barrio of Atimonan, became a municipality. On December 3, 1927, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Padre Burgos by virtue of Act No. 3389, in honor of one of the country&#x27;s martyrs, Fr. Jose Burgos. The streets were named after local leaders who rendered valuable services to the community. Because of the physical and topographic conditions of the town, four sitios where clusters of houses were became the main district of the town, namely: Campo, Burgos, Basiao and Bundok-Punta. The community converged to be in this particular spot because of its sea which made this town as port of Laguimanoc. In the early days this port offered a good wharf for vessels plying between Manila and southern Luzon. This was also a port of call for ships exporting lumber to Europe during the Spanish regime. In this town was the residence of the “Alcalde Mar” or Port Officer.

Business and other industries prospered, and people conglomerated in this spot. Spots of the historical interest are the wharf symbol of commercial progress, the old church with the old-fashioned “canyon” markers of the people&#x27;s religious faith, the Bag Cement Slabs and Stone quarries mute testimonies of the effervescent power and grandeur of the early foreign settlers, the hills near the railroad station where the Japanese tortured and massacred civilians in the barrios of Marao and Polo where the Hunter&#x27;s guerillas built their camps.

==Geography==
Padre Burgos is located on the Bondoc Peninsula just east of Lucena, the provincial capital, and named after José Burgos. It is bounded on the north by Atimonan, on the west and north-west by Pagbilao, on the east by Agdangan, and on the south by the Tayabas Bay. It is from Lucena and from Manila.

<doc id="718545" wikidata="Q5591036" url="?curid=718545" title="Grace Choi">
<text>Grace Choi is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Judd Winick and artist Tom Raney, first appearing in &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) #1 (August 2003) in the Modern Age of Comic Books. Choi is introduced as a young Asian American woman using her powers of superhuman strength, healing, and enhanced durability to make a living as a nightclub bouncer, who is reluctantly recruited by her superhero acquaintance Roy Harper to join his new crew of heroes, the Outsiders.

In the course of their adventures, Grace comes to take pride in her work as a vigilante, and discovers that she is descended from a tribe of Amazons, explaining her better-than-human abilities. While working with the Outsiders, she enters into a relationship with her teammate Thunder, the daughter of superhero and Outsider-founding member Black Lightning.

Outside of comics, Choi appears in the Arrowverse television series &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, portrayed by Chantal Thuy.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Grace Choi is a 7 foot tall Asian-American woman with metahuman strength who sports tattoos styled along Pacific First Nations lines on both of her arms and a circular sun design around her navel.

Grace&#x27;s history was explored in detail in the &quot;Outsiders: Most Wanted&quot; arc, in which it was revealed that she was one of the surviving victims of a prostitution ring that exploited abducted and runaway children as its &quot;merchandise&quot;. Upon reaching puberty, Grace used her then-nascent metahuman powers to escape, and spent the next several years living independently, until her recruitment into the Outsiders.

Though initially the source of Grace&#x27;s powers was not revealed, when the team was captured by the Brain and Monsieur Mallah in &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) #39, they noted that Grace has been enhanced more than &quot;her kind&quot; usually is. The Outsiders were confused by that remark, leading Mallah to laugh and comment: &quot;You mean they don&#x27;t know what you are?&quot; Later, Grace&#x27;s Amazon lineage was revealed.

===Joining the Outsiders===
In her first appearance in &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) #1, she was the bouncer for the metahuman nightclub Chaney&#x27;s in Metropolis; Arsenal recruited her for the newly formed Outsiders. She and Arsenal were old friends but she was not very keen on joining until he told her the Outsiders job would pay her three times more than her bouncer job.

===One Year Later===

Grace Choi remains a member of the Outsiders, and assisted in toppling the regime of Mali. She gets along quite well with the team&#x27;s newest member, Captain Boomerang II, and the two have been involved in the somewhat questionable interrogation of some soldiers, involving torture. It has been revealed that Grace has been secretly involved in a relationship with Thunder (Anissa Pierce). After an unsuccessful mission in North Korea involving Checkmate, Nightwing hands over the Outsiders to Batman, who elects to decide on his own roster culminating in DC Comics&#x27; relaunch of the &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; title.

Grace features in the &quot;Amazons Attack&quot; limited series where during an attack on the United States by the Amazons, she encounters the Bana Amazons. One of its members tells her that she is actually part of their tribe, the explanation for earlier allusions by others to &quot;her kind.&quot; This did not entirely explain Grace&#x27;s metahuman powers, however, both the Bana and Themysciran Amazons possess true metahuman strength, speed, and durability. In the aftermath of the war, Batman assigns Wonder Woman and Grace to a cleanup mission which serves as an audition for his new Outsiders roster. Grace identifies herself as half-Amazonian and displays a deep knowledge of Bana-Mighdall history. Batman and Wonder Woman accept that she is a Bana, and it is confirmed when Grace successfully handles a bomb engineered so that only women with Bana DNA might control it. Diana and Grace end their joint mission describing each other as cousins.

Grace was briefly shown working alongside the Birds of Prey when they attempted to stop a group of villains from killing the Secret Six and taking Neron&#x27;s &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card from them.

Pleased with her performance, Batman welcomes Grace as the final member of his Outsiders. Despite being angry that Thunder &quot;washed out&quot; during Batman&#x27;s try-outs and has been excluded from the team, she accepts. She then invites Thunder back onto the team without Batman&#x27;s permission. Following the apparent death of Bruce Wayne, the Outsiders fall into a trap set by Simon Hurt, and most of the team members are severely injured. The group is disbanded shortly thereafter, and is replaced by a new team of Outsiders.

Some time later, Grace shows up in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #600 as a member of Wonder Woman&#x27;s all-female team of heroes.

Many months after her departure from the Outsiders, Grace is shown in a live-in relationship with Anissa, with both women now in a state of semi-retirement following Anissa&#x27;s recovery. When Black Lightning arrives at Grace and Anissa&#x27;s apartment with his small band of fugitive heroes, Grace comes to his aid and helps fight off the attacking members of the Justice Society of America. In the ensuing battle, Grace renders Stargirl and Mister America unconscious, telling them not to threaten her &quot;in-law&quot;. After the battle with the JSA, both Grace and Thunder agree to join up with Black Lightning&#x27;s small team of Outsiders, who are tasked by Amanda Waller with travelling to Markovia and capturing Geo-Force and his rogue faction of the team. Following a massive battle in Markovia, both teams of Outsiders are disbanded by Batman, and the individual heroes return home.

==Powers and abilities==
Grace Choi possesses metahuman levels of strength, heightened durability and endurance, as well as regeneration and increased healing.

<doc id="718548" wikidata="Q17145452" url="?curid=718548" title="Trainmaster Command Control">
<text>Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel&#x27;s electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry&#x27;s open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains. It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives. The latter require a dedicated remote controller. MTH Corporation&#x27;s DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously. Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts). TMCC/Legacy &quot;broadcasts&quot; its signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features. DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive&#x27;s electrical pickup contacts. While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control. This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly &quot;narrowcast&quot; to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions. In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains.

TMCC permits operation of multiple trains on the same track without complex wiring, and also gives locomotives realistic digitized sounds.

Its development was backed financially by rock and roller Neil Young as part of a partnership between Young and one-time Lionel owner Richard Kughn known as Liontech. Liontech, roughly headquartered on Young&#x27;s northern California ranch, consisted of a loose confederation of technology developers whom Young had assembled to help develop individual components of the TrainMaster Command system.

Chief among these contributors was Applied Design Laboratories of Grass Valley, California, headed by Atari 2600 co-patent holder Ron Milner. Young had been referred to Milner by his neighbor and friend, Nolan Bushnell, co-founder of Atari. Milner&#x27;s team (consisting of numerous members, including Robert Johnson and Bryan Scott) developed the main elements of the Command system, including the innovation of using the Lionel steel tubular track system as a broadcast antenna for digital signals overlaying the electrical power being delivered through the track to locomotives, rolling stock and connected accessories. In larger layout practical application, the use of the track as an antenna has fallen somewhat short of success, however and a separate antenna wire stapled along the right-of-way has proven to solve the problem.

Also included in the TrainMaster Command system is RailSounds, which provides digital sound effects to complement the digital control features of the system. RailSounds was developed by a separate team of technologists in the Bay Area. An early, distinguishing feature of RailSounds was the fact that each individual locomotive system (e.g. a &quot;Hudson&quot; 4-6-4 steam locomotive) was based on a real-life counterpart, not a generic &quot;steam&quot; sound. The Lionel RailSounds Hudson sound system was captured by the Liontech team on location in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, using the former Canadian Pacific &quot;Royal Hudson&quot; as the sound model.

During the 90&#x27;s Lionel Boom Years, TMCC became one of the most popular O Scale remote systems to use. Introduced in 1994, from the years 1996 to 2002, it had its biggest boom but sales for the TMCC declined since technology had soon caught up with the TMCC system but is still available and many Legacy engines and MTH DCS engines do allow the operation of the older TMCC remote system. By 2006, TMCC was replaced by the Cab-2 and the LEGACY system. TMCC today is used in Lionel products mainly in motorized units, switches, and some accessories.

Lionel has since licensed TMCC to some of its competitors, including K-Line, and aftermarket circuit boards are available to add TMCC to O scale and S scale trains that lack the capability.

Neil Young&#x27;s involvement in Liontech was the direct reason for his becoming aware of Kughn&#x27;s putting Lionel Trains, Inc. up for sale in early 1995. Young saw an opportunity to become at least part owner in the company he revered, and working with Liontech team member Jim Bunte, assembled a marketing plan to attract investors to help underwrite the purchase price. After several meetings with potential lead equity partners, a deal was struck with Martin Davis, former chairman of Paramount / Gulf+Western, who had recently divested his ownership in that company to Sumner Redstone of Viacom. With his proceeds, Davis founded Wellspring Associates, a New York-based investment firm. The acquisition of Lionel Trains, Inc. and its September 1995 transformation into Lionel LLC was Wellspring&#x27;s first investment.

The competitor MTH uses a similar system, called DCS.

==TMCCII Legacy==
In their 2006 Volume 2 catalog, Lionel officially unveiled the new TMCCII &quot;Legacy&quot; system. TMCCII promises to revolutionize the way people control and play with their model trains, by adding more features that mimic prototypical operations of a real railroad, and subsequently, a real locomotive. TMCCII is backwards-compatible with existing TMCC modules, and can work simultaneously with CAB-1 controller.

Like TMCCI, the core of the &quot;Legacy&quot; system is the handheld remote. The CAB-2 remote features, among other new functions, a back-lit LCD screen, back-lit LCD touchscreen keypad (which can toggle between numbers and control icons), a Feedback mode (the controller rumbles reflecting the struggling engine), and rechargeable batteries.

The first locomotive to feature TMCCII is the Union Pacific Big Boy. At the moment, only the CAB-2 remote and command base are available, with additional modules being released in due course. The second locomotive that was released was the American Flyer New York Central which arrived back in April 2007.

<doc id="718559" wikidata="Q1750359" url="?curid=718559" title="Sebastian Faust">
<text>Sebastian Faust, commonly known as Faust, is a fictional character in DC Comics. Created by Mike Barr and Paul Pelletier, he first appeared in the 1993 &quot;Outsiders&quot; comic series. The character draws inspiration from the German legend of a man who sold his soul to the Devil. Faust is the son of the supervillain Felix Faust and is depicted as both a superhero and an anti-villain.

In his backstory, Sebastian&#x27;s soul was sold in a Faustian bargain by his father to regain his own mystical abilities. However, the demon Neibiros tricked Felix by granting the powers to Sebastian instead. Sebastian received training in the mystic arts from his father but eventually ran away due to his father&#x27;s abusive behavior. As an adult, he became a mystic superhero and paranormal investigator. His reputation within the DC Universe&#x27;s superhero community is often controversial due to his parentage, his callous methods, and his expertise in black magic. In the DC Rebirth continuity, Faust is reintroduced with a similar origin but portrayed as an anti-villain. He is a highly-regarded agent of the United States government and serves as the director of A.R.G.U.S&#x27;s mystic branch. However, he later betrays the organization in order to save his terminally ill wife. This puts him in conflict with Amanda Waller and her team of mystically-oriented operatives, the Suicide Squad Black.

== Publication history ==

Sebastian Faust was first introduced in the &quot;Outsiders&quot; (Vol. 2) No. 1 &quot;Alpha&quot; in November 1993. Serving as the mystical member of the Outsiders team, he also guest starred alongside his teammates in &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Deathstroke the Terminator&quot; series. After the series&#x27; end in 1995, Sebastian made occasional appearances in other comics such as &quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; but later had a larger role in the 1999 &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; crossover; he would initially appear with a revised history and detailing involving the Enchantress in the &quot;DCU Villains Secret File and Origins&quot; comic released ahead of the event depicting him as a villain. In the actual crossover event, however, much of the details was changed though he still held a significance with Enchantress and was among the characters within the Sentinels of Magic team.

Faust would later star in the 2001 &quot;JLA: Black Baptism&quot; storyline as one of the main characters, his origin from the Outsiders run revised as well as the nature of his powers. Although the character was unused for a few years afterward, he would reappear in the 2006 &quot;Checkmate&quot; series, depicting under the new designated name of &quot;Rook Gamma&quot; as an elite operative &amp; mystic consultant of the fictional intelligence agency, Checkmate. Sebastian would also have a supporting role in other crossovers, including the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; crossover, appearing in the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; series though seemingly no longer a member of Checkmate.

In 2016, the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; event relaunched DC Comics&#x27; entire line of comic book titles. A rebooted version of Sebastian Faust debuted in the backdrop story of &quot;Suicide Squad: Black Files&quot; with a new origin, connections to the fictional agency, A.R.G.U.S, and characterization as an eco-terrorist and anti-villain.

==Characterization==
=== Lack of soul ===
During the 2001 &quot;Black Baptism&quot; storyline, details were added to Sebastian&#x27;s backstory concerning his lack of a soul and the effects of his father&#x27;s act of bartering it away; the lack of a soul caused Sebastian to lose his pupils, making his eyes completely black. To cover this, Faust uses aviators in order to prevent others from being disturbed by the sight. Faust cannot properly process emotions although he does not completely lack them, able to feel romantic love and familial friendships with those such as June Moone/Halo (former) and Blue Devil (the latter). In return, Sebastian was given the power to natural ability to initiate magical (the very power his father desperately craved to re-obtained) and could use soul-magic.

In &quot;Mystik U&quot;, the alternative universe&#x27;s incarnation of Sebastian Faust follows some of the original comic&#x27;s cue of; while lacking the ability to not process emotions, Faust&#x27;s powers are demonic in nature and is difficult to control. He is unable to initiate any sort of intimate contact with individuals nor look directly at others without his aviators in fear of sucking their soul or draining them of their magic. Only powerful magicians like Zatanna could bypass his powers and abilities. His lack of a soul also causes him to possess a demonic form revealed when distressed.

===Reputation===
Prior to the New 52 reboot of the DC Universe, Sebastian started his superhero career in the Outsiders and has since garnered a poor reputation within the superhero community, being once considered a mystical threat in part due to being the son of infamous villain, Felix Faust. While considered a world-renowned soul mage, members of the Justice League (notably Superman and Batman) expressed hesitance &amp; distrust in working with Faust. Only Wonder Woman &amp; Blue Devil has shown unconditional trust in Faust among the Justice League. Faust himself attributes this to his powers affecting other&#x27;s perception of him. Another contributing factor includes his attempt of sacrificing the Enchantress during the events of the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; to reignite the flames of hell through an act of evil, an act that he holds immense remorse for despite his poor capability in processing emotions.

In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, his reputation is portrayed to being far more positive, considered a top notched governmental agent and a known hero among the superhero and mystic community. His turn from hero to villainy and eco-terrorism symbolizes the desperation he faced wanting to save both his unborn child and wife. Despite this direction in his life, the Justice League are portrayed to being sympathetic to Faust&#x27;s circumstances and both expressed interest in helping him rehabilitate for his crimes and were unwilling to allow punishment at the hands of Suicide Squad handler, Amanda Waller, who was speculated to have planned to bring Faust into her magical division of the Suicide Squad.

=== Family relationships ===
Sebastian&#x27;s struggle into proving himself a hero stems from his own, dysfunctional family. He inherited an evil legacy, which he rejects:

* Felix Faust: As an infant, Felix regarded him as a bargaining tool. He was abusive to Sebastian growing up, as he taught him the mystic arts. In turn, Sebastian holds him in low regard and maintains a turbulent relationship with him. He disallowing Felix referring to him by his first name. Despite his father&#x27; evil, however, he respects him as a capable warlock.
* Fauna Faust: She was subjected to the same abuse as Sebastian and he also feels sympathy for her. Unlike Sebastian, Fauna followed a darker path compared to him. She worked with the Kobra Cult&#x27;s elite team, Strike Force Kobra, and their father Felix. Despite their diverging paths, the two share a sibling rivalry when it comes to comparing their sorcerous skills.
* Sebastian and Fauna&#x27;s unnamed mother: Sebastian&#x27;s favored parent, he was confident that she would not have fallen into the sway of dark magic implored by her husband, Felix. Sebastian also told his father that only she is allowed to call him by his first name.

=== Romances ===
Faust first formulated a romantic relationship with fellow Outsider member, Halo, whom Faust initially was portrayed as having feelings for and Halo skeptical and rejecting of his advances due to the mistrust the Outsiders team had for him initially. Eventually the two would pursue a romantic relationship, having first shared a kiss during a New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration. He was also flirtatious with teammate Looker before his relationship with Halo solidified, both characters expressing finding one another attractive on several occasions.

In the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; crossover, it was initially revealed that Sebastian and June Moone were slated to become lovers in a character entry in the &quot;DCU Villains Secret Files and Origins&quot; issue made for both characters ahead of the event. The actual crossover dealt with the two first meeting one another with Faust having come to be attracted to the June, only to have nearly slain her Enchantress personality to re-ignite the flames of Hell with a truly evil act. The ordeal riddled Faust with guilt, having begun developing feelings for her despite June&#x27;s relationship with Alan Dell but ultimately decided to keep his distance. Their relationship is depicted differently in the later Black Baptism event, with June being an exception to Faust&#x27;s usual inability to forming romantic attachments due to his lack of soul (revealed in the storyline). Still ridden with guilt over the events of &quot;Day of Judgement&quot;, Faust visits June frequently, as she was admitted to a hospital on due to the supposed death of her Enchantress personality slowly killing her and leaving her in a nearly unresponsive state, and repeatedly apologizes with lingering hope the two would reunite and continue a relationship should he find a way to reverse her circumstances. Eventually, Faust helps join June back with her Enchantress persona, birthing a new one known as &quot;Soulsinger&quot; who seemingly is moved by his later &quot;sacrifice&quot; during a battle with a powerful sorcerer.

In his new continuity incarnation in DC Rebirth, Faust mentions having met and fell in love with a dryad woman during his days as a director of A.R.G.U.S, the two having married and bore a son. However, a spell brought from work made his wife terminally ill. His wife&#x27;s terminal sickness and unborn child&#x27;s life at risk becomes the catalyst for him to eventually betray A.R.G.U.S in desperation, becoming an eco-terrorist with aims to rid the world of magic to reverse the effects of the terminal sickness spell passed onto his dyad wife, who is in a comatose state from a poison apple fed to her by Faust to buy himself more time to reverse her illness.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Origin ===
Sebastian&#x27;s original origin, detailed in the 1993 &quot;Outsider&quot; series, revealed him to be the British, elder son of Felix Faust and sister to supervillain, Fauna. As a child, he was taught in the mystic arts by his father, who often used familiars to perform magic. When Sebastian was old enough, Felix told his son he intended to give him an initiation into the mystic rites. During the &quot;initiation&quot;, Sebastian learns that he was instead intended to be a sacrifice to a demon so Felix could regain the ability to initiate magic on his own. Instead, the demon granted Sebastian the ability to perform magic on his own at the cost of his magic. He ran away shortly after, causing Felix to attempt the same of his sister and for it to similarly fail and run away too.

Sebastian&#x27;s origin was later revised, his soul instead having been sold as an infant (his original origin depicted him as a young teenager) by the demon, Nebiros, enemy of Swamp Thing and Blue Devil, and granted him soul-magic as a baby and giving him the power to initiate magic naturally though came with the drawback of an uncontrollable power of negative emotional projection, causing others to become more angry or tense the longer they are around Sebastian, making finding meaningful connections with others more difficult. Growing up, Felix&#x27;s manipulative nature extended not only to Sebastian but his mother, who developed acute myeloid leukemia after birthing Fauna. Both of them were subjected to his attempts of seducing them to dark magic. Although Sebastian resisted his influence, his mother eventually began to slowly embrace it until she was killed in a car accident that only Sebastian and Fauna survived.

=== &quot;Outsiders&quot; vol. 2 (1993–1995) ===
In the second volume of the Outsiders, Faust works with the Outsiders and assists the team when they reform under the threat of a vampire invasion of Markovia. When Technocrat&#x27;s bodyguard Charlie Wylde is attacked by a bear, Faust saves him by fusing the two. However, the bear&#x27;s violent side results in the deaths of innocent Markovian soldiers. Wylde is later transformed into a normal bear by Sebastian&#x27;s sister, Fauna.

The Outsiders are on the run for some time, having been framed by the head vampire, Roderick, for the murder of the traitorous Queen Ilona. It is not known that Ilona is trying to kill the Outsiders. Eventually the team clears their names. Throughout his tenure, Faust is not trusted by many of his teammates. Despite this, he develops a romantic relationship with Halo. Soon, Felix, along with Fauna, attacks the team, drawing them into a different dimension. The team suffers various tortures, and survives only due to the flexible laws of reality in this realm. Faust leads an escape attempt. After the team breaks up, Faust tries to pursue a solo career.

=== &quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; (1996–1998) ===
After the dissolution of the Outsiders team, Faust was a frequent guest at an intergalactic rave known as the &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. When Raver hero Half-Life required new reanimated body parts, Faust agreed to help. While performing an incantation, Klarion the Witch Boy sabotages his incantation and causes his ectoplasm to gain sentience. When knocked out, Hero Cruz used the H-Dial to acquire Faust&#x27;s powers and banishes the entity that taken over his ectoplasm.

=== &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; (1999) ===
During the 1999 DC Comics crossover event, &quot;Day of Judgment&quot;, Faust joins with other magical characters of the DC Universe to form the Sentinels of Magic. The denizens of Hell have invaded Earth, led by Asmodel, an angel with the powers of the Spectre. Faust teams up with a varied group of superheroes, including Atom, Superman, Firestorm and Enchantress. They travel to Hell itself and eventually, to the City of Dis, Hell&#x27;s center of power, to relight its fires. During the trip, the heroes are temporarily trapped under the frozen River Styx. Faust manages to rescue Enchantress first; since he has no soul, he is not tormented by the river&#x27;s waters. Inside the city, the heroes discover the demon Nebiros, who has stayed behind to guard the frozen fires. In battle, Faust releases Blue Devil, whose bones he had apparently bought from a mysterious marketplace. Nebiros is slain due to Firestorm changing the water in his body to cement. Faust regains his soul. When the combined forces of the superheroes are not enough to relight the fires. Faust realizes what must be done and murders Enchantress, losing his soul, restarting the fires, and saving the Earth all at once.

In the aftermath of this event, Faust, having developed romantic feelings for Enchantress, would work to find ways of reviving Enchantress.

=== &quot;JLA: The Black Baptism&quot; (2001) ===
Faust next appears during the &quot;Black Baptism&quot; event. Over the course of the story, he works both with and against the Justice League, before ultimately tapping their souls to stop the mighty sorcerer Hermes Trismegistus. Faust comes to realize his newfound friend, Blue Devil, is only staying with him because of the magical nature of his revival. Not willing to risk Blue Devil&#x27;s safety, he eliminates the magical connection by plunging the last of Blue Devil&#x27;s bones into his back. Following the battles, Faust fakes the death of both himself and his father. Blue Devil soon dies in battle against Hermes but is revived.

=== &quot;Checkmate&quot; (2006–2008) ===
Faust was first mentioned in the 2006 &quot;Checkmate&quot; series as a consultant brought in by the intelligence organization to program magical capacities and defenses into their technological creation, Gideon-II. Later, he is revealed to be a member of the clandestine spy organization as one of their elite teams, &quot;The Rooks&quot;. His callsign designation in Checkmate is &quot;Rook Gamma&quot;. He is called upon to help neutralize a medical facility occupied by the Kobra Cult cultivating mutant, snake-like infants through the use of blood magic to be future soldiers of Kobra.

=== &quot;Justice League of America: The Dark Things&quot; (2010–2011) ===
Faust would make an appearance in the aftermath of the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; as he helps the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America contain the chaos created from the revival of the Starheart, which causes metahumans of magical origin around the world to go wild. Using his expertise in the occult, he helps the Justice League and the JSA defeat the consciousness of the Starheart, who has taken the form of famed hero and Green Lantern Alan Scott and taken control of the newest incarnation of Doctor Fate, Kent V. Nelson. He also helps the superhero Jade come to terms with her resurrection and newfound heighten levels of power resulting from her coming back from the dead.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In the new continuity, Sebastian Faust retained elements of his previous version and more recent origin; he is still the older son of Felix Faust, the brother of Fauna Faust, and was once a member of the Outsiders at some point. Some conditions had changed compared to the previous continuity: Sebastian&#x27;s soul was sold by Felix in an effort to gain immortality instead of magical powers, the newer version of Sebastian having natural abilities in performing magic but was granted soul magic from the attempted bargain much like before. Unlike the previous continuity, he is American and no longer wears sunglasses, having pupils in his eyes despite possessing no soul. Unlike other continuities, he is also the grandson of Majika the Magnificent on his father&#x27;s side.

==== &quot;Suicide Squad: Black Files: Fortune&#x27;s Wheel&quot; (2016) ====
In the &quot;Suicide Squad: Black Files&quot; limited series, Faust betrays America and A.R.G.U.S, stealing all of the magical artifacts A.R.G.U.S held as well as the Russian&#x27;s own stockpile of mystical weaponry while assuming control of former mystical terrorist cell he fought against, Cerebus. In response, Amanda Waller assembled a sorcery team to counter the wizard but is unable to track their movements due to Faust&#x27;s actions and enlists the aid of Klarion, who tells her that she is to assemble a different team of magical users to battle Faust. With a mystical team, the Suicide Squad Black, consisting of El Diablo, Enchantress, Klarion, Gentleman Ghost, Azucar, and Dr. Thaumaturge, they find themselves opposed by Faust and his followers, including his majordomo Tiamat (the former Snargoyle of the previous sorcery team) and acolyte Wither. Faust planned to use multiple powerful mystic artifacts and assemble a weapon known as the Quellzorn, a mystic behemoth capable of feeding all magic to remove magic all together, having become disillusioned with its existence after both his experiences in seeing its capability to make others suffer and its personal effect on him due to having accidentally infected his dryad wife, pregnant with his unborn son, with a fatal mystic illness from a spell he caught in his work. Eventually, the team emerges victorious and Faust is defeated. He is later taken in by the Justice League to be rehabilitated.

=== The Other History of the DC Universe (2021) ===
Faust would make a brief appearance in the &quot;Other History of the DC Universe&quot; within Katana&#x27;s recount taking place during the &quot;Outsiders&quot; series. She recounted Violet&#x27;s soul asserting herself over Gabriella Doe, the being who would take Violet&#x27;s body. Katana would mention Violet&#x27;s indulgence in pleasures included having a sexual relationship with Faust.

==Powers and abilities==
Over time, Faust&#x27;s abilities and skill level have evolved. Initially considered skilled but inferior to his father, Felix Faust, he later emerged as a significant supernatural force, ranking among the most formidable magic users on Earth. While powerful, his abilities were still deemed inferior to those of Doctor Fate. Faust was regarded on par with other mystical menaces such as Wizard (William Zard) and the Enchantress. In the DC Rebirth, he is also described as the top arcane operative in the United States and the most proficient magic user in A.R.G.U.S., having previously led its arcane division. 

He was initially characterized as a warlock considered an adept in black magic, a form of magic known to come at a high cost for its practitioners. Faust&#x27;s expertise also extended to soul magic, a powerful form of magic that grants him control over souls and provides a range of abilities. Chiefly, this include the ability to mimic the special abilities of others by tapping into their soul. When Sebastian utilizes soul magic to drain the abilities of others, it leaves them in a withered and shriveled state, as if their life force has been drained. Sebastian has the unique ability to mimic powers by simply touching individuals who possess those abilities. Through this tactile connection, he can replicate various powers, such as creating constructs like Green Lantern, accessing the Speed Force for enhanced speed and precision like The Flash, and even assuming a humanoid lizard form similar to the Kobra Cult. In DC Rebirth, Faust practices &quot;logomancy,&quot; a form of magic similar to hero sorceress Zatanna. By speaking words backwards, he can invoke desired effects. Additionally, it is implied Faust retains his mastery over soul magic.

In addition to his magical skills, Faust is a proficient occult investigator and possesses extensive knowledge of the supernatural. He surpasses his father in their shared expertise in soul magic and excels as an occult transcriber. Faust is also adept at covering his tracks, espionage, hand-to-hand combat, and leadership. Furthermore, he exhibits a high resistance to mystical corruption and soul erosion due to his lack of a soul and strong willpower. Faust possesses several magical talismans, most notably a belt and magical pouches. His pouches, made of high-grade steel and concealed within a medium-sized cloth bag, have mystical properties that allow them to hold a vast number of artifacts, energies, and surprises.

=== Cost and weaknesses ===
Faust&#x27;s magical powers come with several drawbacks. In the Outsider comic series, his practice of black magic results in a cost known as &quot;feedback.&quot; This feedback causes his spells to overload, affecting his surroundings and causing physical pain to Faust himself. Additionally, his soul magic inadvertently has an impact on those around him. The more time people spend in his presence, the more prone they become to feeling tense and irritated, making it challenging for Faust to form meaningful relationships and difficult for him to process emotions. The effects on others can vary.

==Other versions==

* An alternate universe variant of Sebastian Faust appears in &quot;Mystik U&quot;. This version is a student of the titular school and love interest of Zatanna.
* An alternate universe variant of Sebastian Faust who became the leader of the Sentinels of Magic appears in &quot;Flashpoint Beyond&quot;.

<doc id="718564" wikidata="Q675180" url="?curid=718564" title="Meijin (Go)">
<text>Meijin (名人) means &quot;Expert or Master&quot;. It is the name of the second most prestigious Japanese Go Tournament. It also refers to a traditional Japanese title given to the strongest player of the day during the Edo period.

== The tournament ==
The Meijin tournament is sponsored by the &quot;Asahi&quot; newspaper, and has prize money of ¥30,000,000 for the winner (since the 45th Meijin in 2020).

The tournament is open to Nihon Ki-in and Kansai Ki-in players. A nine-player league decides the challenger each year. Every year, the three worst-ranked players in the league drop out. Entrance into the league is decided by three preliminaries. The first is between 1-4 dans (6 winners: 4 Nihon ki-in and 2 Kansai ki-in). The second is between 5-9 dans and the six winners (18 winners). The third is between these 18 and the 3 people dropped from the league (3 winners, who enter the league). Komi is 6.5. The time limit is 8 hours each in the title matches and 3 hours in the league and prelims. Byo-yomi is 1 minute per move.

== History ==
The title of &quot;Meijin&quot; derives from a game played by the first Hon&#x27;inbō, Sansa. An onlooker (no less than Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga) watched him play a particularly brilliant move and exclaimed &quot;Meijin!&quot; in appreciation of its greatness. The term was thereafter applied to the strongest player of the day. Sansa, besides being Nobunaga&#x27;s Go tutor, also taught Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who, after taking control, established Sansa as Godokoro, roughly meaning &quot;Head of the Government Go Bureau.&quot; The Meijin title came to be greatly prized by all of the most promising Go prodigies of the age, freed from the cares of everyday life by the government stipends coming from the Go Bureau. Most often held by members of the Hon&#x27;inbō school, it was also held by brilliant Yasuis and Inoues. No player from Hayashi house attained Meijin status. The title &quot;Meijin&quot; is also attached to the rank of 9 dan during this period hence there is only one 9-dan/Meijin at a time even if there are many players that are at the strength of a 9 dan. 8-dans in the Edo period are called Jun-Meijin which means half-Meijin which is a rank accorded to sixteen players in the Edo period. After the Meiji Revolution, the four houses fell into disrepair due to the lack of government stipends.

In 1958, the &quot;Yomiuri&quot; newspaper decided to sponsor a &quot;Strongest Player&quot; tournament to decide the strongest player of the current time. In 1961 the tournament&#x27;s name was changed to Meijin.

Since they already sponsored the Shogi Meijin tournament, in 1975 the &quot;Asahi&quot; newspaper offered to buy the rights to the Meijin tournament from the Yomiuri. After months of debating, the title was sold and the Yomiuri began sponsoring a new title, Kisei (Go Saint). The tournament before 1976 thus became called the &quot;Old Meijin&quot;.

<text>The 1939 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were the last ones conducted prior to the Hall&#x27;s opening that year. Needing just one addition to complete the initial goal of 10 inductees from the 20th century, members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting active players. Difficulties in convening the Centennial Commission of the previous two years led to an even smaller Old-Timers Committee selecting inductees from the 19th century – a cause of particular urgency to many who had been anticipating the five promised but unfulfilled selections in that area for over three years.

In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in Cooperstown, New York, on June 12 of that year. After the Hall&#x27;s opening, a special election was also held in December. Because the initial goal for the Hall&#x27;s opening of selecting 10 players from the 20th century had now been met, it was further decided to delay the next election until 1942, even though observers widely believed that electing three players per year (12 had been elected in four regular BBWAA elections) had turned out to be an ideal rate.

==BBWAA regular election==
A total of 274 ballots were cast, with 2,710 individual votes for 108 specific candidates, an average of 9.89 per ballot; 206 votes were required for election. Although three stars of the 1920s did very well, the balloting was otherwise dominated by players of the 1900s and 1910s, who many voters felt should be given priority. Players who had been retired over 20 years received 60% of the votes, and accounted for 14 of the top 20 in the balloting. Due to frustration over the fact that no 19th century players had yet been selected, a number of players from that era whose careers extended into the 20th century only briefly (or not at all) even received some votes, as did some managers. The results were announced in January 1939. The three candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:


==Old-Timers Committee==
As the opening of the Hall approached, criticism mounted that no 19th century figures who were known primarily as players had yet been selected, when basic plans nearly four years earlier had promised five as an ideal initial number. In addition, the six-member Centennial Commission which had selected honorees in the previous two years never had an opportunity to meet. As a result, a smaller &quot;Hall of Fame Committee&quot; (also known as the Old-Timers Committee) of only three members—Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, National League president Ford Frick, and American League president Will Harridge—was formed to choose appropriate honorees; their selections were announced on May 2, less than six weeks before the Hall&#x27;s opening. They chose six inductees, all of whom were deceased; of the 13 committee selections between 1937 and 1939, only Connie Mack was still living at the time of the Hall&#x27;s opening (his Athletics played in the inaugural Hall of Fame game). The committee&#x27;s choices included the two players who had tied for first in the failed 1936 Veterans vote (the third- and fourth-place finishers had by this time been selected by the BBWAA; the sixth-place choice had been selected by an earlier committee):

*Cap Anson, a star first baseman from the 1870s through the late 1890s, and also a successful manager, who is now widely recognized as the first player to collect 3000 hits in the topmost professional leagues.
*Buck Ewing, the game&#x27;s premier catcher in the 1880s and early 1890s.

The remaining inductees were:
*Charles &quot;Old Hoss&quot; Radbourn, who won 309 games in an 11-year career in the 1880s, including a record 60 wins in 1884; he had finished seventh in the 1936 vote.
*Albert Spalding, the game&#x27;s best pitcher in the 1870s (252 wins from 1871 to 1876), who managed Chicago to the first NL pennant and later became not only part owner of the team and the club president, but also the founder of a major sporting goods company.
*Charles Comiskey, a defensive standout at first base in the 1880s who also managed his team to four consecutive pennants and later became owner of the Chicago White Sox, elected more for his overall influence on the game than for his playing days.
*William &quot;Candy&quot; Cummings, who the committee members decided had the strongest claim to having invented the curveball.

==Special election of Lou Gehrig==

At the major league winter meetings in Cincinnati in December 1939, the BBWAA held a special election to act on Lou Gehrig, who had announced his retirement that summer after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The writers elected Gehrig to the Hall of Fame (the results of that election are unknown) and also determined to postpone the next regular election until 1942, as the initial quota of 10 inductees from the 20th century had been met.

<doc id="718584" wikidata="Q5896226" url="?curid=718584" title="Hon'inbō Shūho">
<text>, born as Murase Shūho (村瀬 秀甫), was a professional Japanese Go player who was an important figure in the popularization of the game. He was the first Japanese Go player to have a reputation in the Western world. At a time when he was thought to be the best player in Japan, he taught the game to chemist Oskar Korschelt, a visitor from Germany. Korschelt later was the first person to popularize Go to a notable degree in a non-Asian country. Shūho is also credited with the innovation of time limits being imposed on a game of Go.

==Biography==
Shūho became a student in the Hon&#x27;inbō house at the age of seven, reaching 1-dan rank in 1848 at the age of 10. In 1861 when he was 23 he reached 6-dan. He was the strongest Hon&#x27;inbō disciple after Shūsaku, and Shūwa wanted to make him his heir when Shūsaku died, but Jōwa&#x27;s widow blocked this plan.

In 1879 he founded the Hoensha institution with Nakagawa Kamesaburo. Hoensha would help to create a new revival of go via the publishing of the first magazine focused on Go called &quot;Igo Shinpo&quot; or &quot;Go News&quot;.

Shūho became the 18th Hon&#x27;inbō in 1886, inheriting the title from Hayashi Shuei.

Shūho published the famous book &quot;Hoen Shinpo&quot; in 1882, which outlined the Meiji era fuseki. After a rapprochement between the Hoensha and the Honinbo house in 1886, Shūei promoted Shūho to 8-dan and stepped aside to allow him to become head of the Hon&#x27;inbō house. Shūho died only three months after becoming Hon&#x27;inbō. In the last few years of his life he was the strongest player in Japan.

<doc id="718597" wikidata="Q13557517" url="?curid=718597" title="Phatic expression">
<text>In linguistics, a phatic expression (, ) is a communication which primarily serves to establish or maintain social relationships. In other words, phatic expressions have mostly socio-pragmatic rather than semantic functions. They can be observed in everyday conversational exchanges, as in, for instance, exchanges of social pleasantries that do not seek or offer information of intrinsic value but rather signal willingness to observe conventional local expectations for politeness.

Other uses of the term include the category of &quot;small talk&quot; (conversation for its own sake) in speech communication, where it is also called social grooming. In Roman Jakobson&#x27;s typology of communication functions, the &#x27;phatic&#x27; function of language concerns the channel of communication; for instance, when one says &quot;I can&#x27;t hear you, you&#x27;re breaking up&quot; in the middle of a cell-phone conversation. This usage appears in research on online communities and micro-blogging.

==Purpose==
Phatic communion denotationally breaks Grice&#x27;s conversational maxims, because it gives information that is unnecessary, untrue, or irrelevant. It has important connotational meanings that do not break these maxims and is best understood as an important part of language in its role in establishing, maintaining, and managing bonds of sociality between participants, as well as creating feelings of solidarity and familiarity, and putting participants at ease.

==History==
The term &quot;phatic communion&quot; (&#x27;bonding by language&#x27;) was coined by anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski in his essay &quot;The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages&quot;, which appeared in 1923 as a supplementary contribution to &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot; by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. The term &quot;phatic&quot; means &#x27;linguistic&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;by language&#x27;) and comes from the Greek (&#x27;spoken, that may be spoken&#x27;), from (&#x27;I speak, say&#x27;).

==Importance of context==
Many expressions generally considered to be phatic (&quot;see below&quot;) may be a genuine request for information in certain contexts. For example, in British English, &quot;How are you?&quot; is a phatic expression used when greeting someone one knows, especially when a participant wants to initiate conversation. It can also be asked sincerely, inferrable from context, such as when a friend gives bad news, or tone, such falling intonation to show it as a genuine question (as is with w/h-word questions), or speaking more quietly. Authenticity of the question can also be emphasised by the addition of the word &quot;feeling&quot; (&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;).

==Phatic expressions in various languages==
===Danish===
Danish has several phatic greetings:

* &#x27;how goes it?&#x27;. Possible answers are: &#x27;it goes good/fine&#x27;.
* &#x27;how does it cut?&#x27; Informal greeting between close friends.
* &#x27;what then?&#x27;. Similar to the English greeting &quot;what&#x27;s up?&quot;. More often used in Jutland. A possible answer is &#x27;not that much&#x27;.
* is a common informal greeting and equivalent to the English &quot;hi,&quot; pronounced almost the same&quot;.&quot; Single-word greetings with approximately the same meaning include (from combining with German from French &quot;),&quot; &quot;,&quot; (both reduced forms of meaning &#x27;day&#x27;), , , , (Pun greeting. Made by combining and &#x27;onion sauce&#x27;), &#x27;nice good day&#x27; is a more formal greeting.
* is only used when the speaker is not sure they can be heard. Examples when saying/yelling is appropriate: Trying to find out if someone else is in a seemingly empty room/building; using it as an initial phone greeting; checking if the person you&#x27;re calling can still hear you (when experiencing a bad phone connection); trying to get the attention of a listener that appears to not pay attention.
* &quot;Mojn&quot; is only used in Southern Jutland. It comes from North German from the German word meaning &#x27;morning&#x27;. Despite its original meaning it is used as a greeting throughout the day. 
* or are common ways to say goodbye. &#x27;we will see each other&#x27; is used as a farewell greeting in face-to-face conversations while &#x27;we will speak each other&#x27;/ &#x27;we will speak to each other by&#x27; are used in both face-to-face and phone/text conversations. 
* &#x27;drive safely&#x27; is said to a person leaving the place where the speaker is located and going to drive/bike to another location. &#x27;come well home&#x27; is said in the same situation whatever the method of transportation.
* &#x27;good lust for work&#x27; is said when parting with a person that is either currently at work or leaving to go to work.
* &#x27;thanks for today&#x27; is often said in more formal contexts of prolonged interactions like at the end of a meeting or the end of a class. 
* &#x27;thanks for the last time that we were together&#x27; acknowledging that the people were together somewhere
* &#x27;good recovery&#x27;. Said when leaving a sick person.
* &#x27;have it good&#x27; or &#x27;you (sg./pl.) may have it good&#x27; is a farewell phrase wishing for the other&#x27;s well-being. A joke variant of this is &#x27;have it as you look&#x27; (literally: &#x27;have it as you look out&#x27;). By not saying the expected adjective &#x27;good&#x27;, the speaker is violating the maxim of quantity and thereby inferring that they do not think the listener looks good. This can be understood as an insult and is therefore mainly used informally between friends.

Some phatic greetings are only used in writings such as letters, e-mails and speeches read aloud:

* &#x27;dear&#x27; followed by a name is a formalised way of beginning a letter, speech etc.
* Ways to end a letter or e-mail include &#x27;greeting&#x27;, &#x27;(with) friendly greeting&#x27;, sometimes abbreviated to . Others include &#x27;with loving greeting&#x27; abbreviated &quot;,&quot; &#x27;hug&#x27;.

Some greetings like can be used throughout the day. Some are more specific, and the specific time of when to switch to the next greeting can vary from speaker to speaker. Time-specific greetings include 
 (&#x27;good morning&#x27;), (literally &#x27;good pre-noon&#x27;), (&#x27;good day&#x27;), (&#x27;good afternoon&#x27;), (&#x27;good evening&#x27;), and (&#x27;good night&#x27;).

Ways of saying thanks include &#x27;thanks&#x27;, &#x27;thanks shall you have&#x27;, &#x27;many thanks&#x27;, &#x27;thousand thanks&#x27;, &#x27;thanks for that&#x27; and &#x27;I thank&#x27;. A thanks can be answered with &#x27;self thanks&#x27; or &#x27;it was so little&#x27; (referring to the small amount of work that had to be done).

Other phatic expressions include (&#x27;luck and fortune&#x27;), equivalent to the English &quot;good luck&quot;, and (&#x27;crack and break&#x27;) which has the same meaning as &quot;good luck&quot; similar to the English expression &quot;break a leg&quot;, mostly used by hunters, fishers, and theater crews.

===English===
&quot;You&#x27;re welcome&quot;, in its phatic usage, is not intended to convey the message that the hearer is welcome; it is a phatic response to being thanked, which in turn is a phatic whose function is to acknowledge the receipt of a benefit.

Similarly, the question &quot;how are you?&quot; is usually an automatic component of a social encounter. Although there are times when &quot;how are you?&quot; is asked in a sincere, concerned manner and does in fact anticipate a detailed response regarding the respondent&#x27;s present state, this needs to be pragmatically inferred from context and intonation.

Example: a simple, basic exchange between two acquaintances in a non-formal environment:

:Speaker one: &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot; (US English. In UK English this more commonly means &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot;)
:Speaker two: &quot;Hey, how&#x27;s it going?&quot; (In US English &quot;Hey&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Hi&quot;, or &quot;Hello&quot;. Adding &quot;How&#x27;s it going&quot; returns the initial greeting-query, paraphrased, without offering any information about what is possibly &quot;up&quot;. In short, the first speaker&#x27;s token is replied to with the second speaker&#x27;s equivalent token, not actually answering the first speaker&#x27;s literal query.)

Or:

:Speaker one: &quot;All right?&quot; (UK English. In US English this can only be a tag question, approximately meaning &quot;Do you agree with or accept what I&#x27;ve said?&quot; In the US, the longer question &quot;(Are) you all right?&quot; is possible to mean &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;)
:Speaker two: &quot;Yeah, all right.&quot;

In both dialogues, neither speaker expects an actual answer to the question but rather it is an indication that each has recognized the other&#x27;s presence and has therefore sufficiently performed that particular social duty.

=== Icelandic ===
There are several phatic greetings in Icelandic differing in formality:

* &#x27;What say you (good)?&#x27;. Equal to English &quot;how are you?.&quot; To a foreign speaker it can seem strange that the preferred answer, &#x27;good&#x27;, is embedded in the question. A preferred answer can be &#x27;I say everything good/fine&#x27;
* &#x27;how goes?&#x27;.

Thanking:

* &#x27;thanks for&#x27;.

In Japanese, phatic expressions play a significant role in communication, for instance the backchannel responses referred to as &quot;aizuchi&quot;. Other such expressions include the ubiquitous (&#x27;please treat me well&#x27;, used before starting work with someone), (lit. &#x27;you must be tired&#x27;, closer to &#x27;thank you for your hard work&#x27;—used for leave-taking and sometimes as a greeting) and (&#x27;thank you for your support&#x27;).

=== Mandarin Chinese ===
In China, the phatic expression &#x27;have you eaten?&#x27; is equivalent to English speakers&#x27; &quot;how are you?&quot; Food culture is important in China and thus inquiring if one is well-fed implies the speaker&#x27;s desire to know if the listener has this basic need met. This expression is most often used by older members of society toward younger people.

===Persian===

Taarof is a complex set of expressions and other gestures in Persian society, primarily reflected in the language.

===Welsh===
In Welsh, the general phatic is a regional and colloquial version of (&#x27;how is?&#x27;). The general pronunciation in southern Wales is and in the North, . The usual answer is (&#x27;OK&#x27;) or, (&#x27;OK, thanks&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;or maybe the more traditional (&#x27;quite good&#x27;), (&#x27;quite good, thanks&#x27;). Many native speakers do not answer like this, but simply say, or in response.

The use of phatic has been used as a Welsh language campaigners to encourage Welsh speakers to begin conversations in Welsh, and for non-fluent speakers to &quot;give it a go&quot;. Shwmae Sumae Day was held for the first time in 2013 and is held annually on 13 October.

===In fiction===
Phatic expressions are often created by authors, particularly in science fiction or fantasy, as part of their worldbuilding.

* In &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by George R. R. Martin, the people of Essos use the expression &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot; (&#x27;All men must die&#x27;), answered with &quot;Valar Dohaeris&quot; (&#x27;All men must serve&#x27;).
* In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, &quot;May the Force be with you&quot; is used as a leave-taking phrase.
* In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the expression &quot;live long and prosper&quot; is used phatically, accompanied by a Vulcan salute.
* In &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Margaret Atwood, &quot;Blessed be the Fruit&quot; is a common greeting exchanged between the people of the Republic of Gilead, responded to with &quot;May the Lord open.&quot;

==Non-verbal phatic expressions==
Non-verbal phatic expressions are used in nonverbal communication for emphasis or to add detail to the message that a person conveys or expresses. Common examples of these are smiling, gesturing, waving, etc. According to Dr. Carola Surkamp, professor at University of Cologne, non-verbal phatic communication can be expressed with involuntary physical features such as direction of gaze, blushing, posture, etc. and that these have a vital function in regulating conversation.

==Online phatic expressions==
Phatic expressions are used on different communication platforms on the internet such as social media networks where certain platforms require and prompt certain actions to be made between users to communicate or implicate certain messages between people without direct utterances. Examples for this would be: &#x27;likes&#x27;, comments/replies, shares/reblogs, emoji use, etc. These &quot;phatic posts&quot; as Radovanovic and Ragnedda like to call them, are again used with a social function of social communicative upkeep with the primary function of expressing social connection, relationships between users, and recognition of coparticipants.

<text>The was a tournament used in Japan, by the Nihon Ki-in and Kansai Ki-in, to determine the ranking of its go professionals on the dan scale. It was instituted in the 1920s soon after the Ki-in was set up in 1924. Initially it was run in Spring and Autumn sessions in Tokyo, with the pros brought together to play around eight games in each session (the name means simply &quot;grand meeting&quot;). It has currently ceased to exist after it was replaced by new reforms. 
Professionals in the Nihon Ki-in could claim promotions based on their performance in the Oteai. To qualify for a promotion, players had to win a certain percentage of a certain number of successive games. The proportion, and number of games depended on the player&#x27;s current rank, with qualification obviously becoming more stringent as one progressed.

<text>Starscream is a character in the &quot;Transformers&quot; media franchise produced by the American toy company Hasbro and the Japanese toy company Takara Tomy. He is the second-in-command of the Decepticons, a villainous faction of alien robots that seeks to conquer their home planet of Cybertron and the rest of the known universe. As with all Cybertronians, Starscream can disguise himself by transforming into vehicles, in his case a fighter jet, and he is usually portrayed as a treacherous and cowardly air commander who seeks to overthrow his leader Megatron and assume control of the Decepticons.

The original suggestion for the character&#x27;s name was Ulchtar, which was a factitious name with no meaning. Bob Budiansky convinced Hasbro to name the character as Starscream instead.

== Character biography ==
Starscream has the ambition to overthrow Megatron as the Decepticons&#x27; leader. He has gained the control he craves on several occasions, but he eventually suffers defeat. Starscream is ruthless, cruel, bloodthirsty, and more intelligent than the average Decepticon, but also, unlikely to act directly on these aspirations without first securing conditions favorable to his ascension. He considers himself vastly superior to other Decepticons and finds Megatron contemptible for his antiquated military strategies and tactics.

Starscream believes the Decepticons should employ guile and speed more readily than brute force to defeat the Autobots. However, given the chance to lead, he is often less successful in this than Megatron. While Megatron frequently overlooks him as a threat, authors suggest such reasons for Megatron&#x27;s tolerance of Starscream&#x27;s presence as a grudging respect for his scheming nature and precautionary observation. Others suggest that Starscream&#x27;s treacherous nature is welcomed; that without a threat to his command, Megatron believes he would become soft and overconfident, or that he even found his transgressions amusing. Even so, Starscream often quickly exhausts Megatron&#x27;s patience; violent-yet-brief verbal and/or physical conflicts between the two are not uncommon. As such, there have been times when Megatron has been close to killing Starscream.

Starscream’s first appearance is in the 1983 Diaclone toy catalog, in which he is introduced as one of two colorations for a toy called “JetRobo” that transforms into a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. Later when Hasbro purchased this toy mold, along with several others in 1984, he was introduced and given the name Starscream in the Generation 1 animated series and the adjacent Marvel Comics series. As Decepticon Air Commander, he leads the other Decepticon Seeker jets, many of whom share his physical design. His technical specifications indicate top speed as Mach 2.8 and altitude ceiling as . Launchers mounted on his arm (under his wings in jet mode) can deliver cluster bombs capable of leveling a area and fire his signature null ray, which for brief periods disrupts the flow of electricity in any circuitry it contacts. This action temporarily renders inoperable any electronic device or machine, including Transformers.

== Animated series ==

=== Generation 1 ===
Starscream was formerly a scientist and explorer, working with the future Autobot Skyfire, during the Golden Age of Cybertron, shortly before the Autobot/Decepticon war re-erupted. Following the disappearance of Skyfire when the two were exploring a prehistoric Earth, Starscream returned to Cybertron and soon abandoned his scientific pursuits, becoming a warrior in Megatron&#x27;s Decepticon army as the civil war exploded. Starscream attended the Cybertron War Academy, mentioned in the episode &quot;A Prime Problem&quot;.
Starscream makes use of his old scientific profession in a few episodes. For example, in &quot;A Decepticon Raider in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, when he and several other Decepticons were temporarily displaced in time to medieval England, the weapons of the Transformers ceased functioning; Starscream knew how to use available materials to create gunpowder as a substitute for himself and the other Decepticons.

In &quot;Starscream&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, he attempts—in what was then only his latest in a series of attempts—to overthrow Megatron as the leader of the Decepticons. After being defeated and exiled in Guadalcanal, Starscream finds the remains of some World War II military vehicles, which inspire him to create an army of his own. He travels to Cybertron using the Space Bridge, forcing the guards and eluding Shockwave to do so. He breaks into the Decepticon Detention Center and steals the five personality components of Renegade Decepticons, then installs them into five wrecked military vehicles and they become the Combaticons. The Combaticons (who combine to form Bruticus) and Starscream then capture four Transformers. When Megatron rallies his troops (except the Stunticons) against Starscream and the Combaticons, he deploys Devastator to fight Bruticus, but Devastator is defeated. Megatron attempts to retreat, however Starscream orders Bruticus to capture Megatron and hold him while he gloats and humiliates him. While this is going on, the Stunticons arrive, combine into Menasor and defeat Bruticus. Megatron then orders Astrotrain to exile Starscream and the Combaticons to a distant asteroid. In the next episode, &quot;The Revenge of Bruticus&quot;, the Combaticons blame Starscream for their punishment. They imprison him on Cybertron after he abandons them, and plan a devastating revenge on Megatron by pulling the Earth towards the Sun using Cybertron&#x27;s controls. After proving his worth in helping Megatron and Optimus Prime (who teamed up to prevent the Earth from destruction) stop the deranged Bruticus, Starscream gets restored to Decepticon ranks.

In &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, Starscream and many other Decepticons participate in the battle of Autobot City, leaving several Autobots killed. After the Decepticons&#x27; defeat, they retreat to Astrotrain. In order to reduce Astrotrain&#x27;s mass, the Decepticons were left with no choice but to jettison the heavily damaged Skywarp, Thundercracker, and Insecticons into space, and Starscream tosses a mortally wounded Megatron out of Astrotrain. After that, he nominates himself as the new leader of the Decepticons. However, during a grandiose coronation ceremony, Megatron, who has been reborn as Galvatron alongside Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps, arrives and declares the coronation a &quot;bad comedy&quot;. Starscream realizes that Galvatron was once Megatron, and Galvatron transforms into laser cannon mode, obliterating Starscream with a single shot.

However, while Starscream&#x27;s body has disintegrated, his &quot;spark&quot; remains as a ghost and returns later. In &quot;Starscream&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, he encounters his old friend Octane in the Decepticon Crypt and conspires with him to hand Galvatron over to Rodimus Prime, the new leader of the Autobots. Starscream possesses Cyclonus&#x27;s body and tricks Galvatron into being captured by the Autobots. Galvatron escapes and later shoots Cyclonus when he realizes that Starscream&#x27;s ghost is possessing his second-in-command. The vengeful ghost easily escapes and re-appears in an additional episode, &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;. In the episode, he first appears to possess Scourge and reactivates the head of Unicron. Starscream then makes a deal with Unicron to restore the latter&#x27;s sight and body by stealing the eyes of Metroplex and transformation cog of Trypticon, and wiring Unicron&#x27;s head to Cybertron. Starscream successfully accomplishes most of this, however, when he can no longer possess Scourge, he demands that Unicron restore his own, original body so that he can complete the connections. Unicron complies and again demands that Starscream complete the connections, only to have Starscream double-cross him and tell him to &quot;do it himself&quot;. At this point, the Autobots set off an explosion that blows Unicron&#x27;s head and Starscream out into space. As Starscream tumbles out of control, he encounters the Decepticons who unleash all of their firepowers on him, damaging him and pushing him farther into space. Starscream is not encountered again in G1.

=== &quot;Beast Wars&quot; ===
The G1 incarnation of Starscream returns in &quot;Beast Wars: Transformers&quot;, voiced by Doug Parker. In the episode &quot;Possession&quot;, He takes control of Waspinator&#x27;s body while a lightning storm occurs. The Predacons recognize him as Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticons. Starscream claims that he had been killed in battle defending Galvatron from Unicron, and pledges his allegiance to the Predacon leader Megatron. In reality, he was destroyed by Galvatron, and plots to usurp Megatron and take control of the Predacons. He captures the Maximal base, and later holds Optimus Primal and Dinobot hostage, ordering the Maximals to attack the Predacon base in exchange for their safety. He is defeated by the combined efforts of Optimus Primal and Blackarachnia, freeing Waspinator&#x27;s body, and sending Starscream&#x27;s ghost hurtling back into the depths of space. In &quot;The Agenda&quot;, Starscream makes a cameo appearance aboard the Ark, frozen in a stasis lock.

=== &quot;Beast Wars II&quot; ===
In the Japanese-exclusive animated series, &quot;Beast Wars II&quot;, a character named Starscream was one of Galvatron&#x27;s most loyal minions. Like the Decepticon air commander who came before him, Starscream is both ambitious and deadly. He makes up for his lack of size with unmatched speed and maneuverability. He hopes to one day dethrone Galvatron as the Predacon emperor of destruction and rule the universe himself. He is also slightly effeminate, often laughing and gesturing in a shaky way. When transformed Starscream becomes a stealth fighter capable of soaring at very high speed. In fighter mode, he can use the &quot;Formation Scream&quot; and combine it with his loyal partner BB to become a powerful air fighter, in which Starscream forms the rear of the combination. In robot mode, his attack of choice is his &quot;Screamwinder Missiles&quot; which are strong enough to vaporize most opponents. Starscream tries to undermine his equally treacherous rival Megastorm. Starscream, during an assassination attempt, accidentally turned Megastorm into Gigastorm. Gigastorm paid Starscream and BB back in kind, but exposure to Angalmosis energy turned them into Hellscream and Max B. As Hellscream, he has the beast mode of a cyborg shark, whilst Max B transforms into a cyborg wolf. Hellscream is last seen escaping the exploding Nemesis with Max B and Gigastorm. They do reappear in &quot;Beast Wars Neo&quot;, where they and the rest of the Maximals and Predacons from best series, help rebuild Cybertron after the defeat of Unicron.

=== Unicron Trilogy ===
Starscream appears in &quot;Transformers: Armada&quot; as a young arrogant warrior who desperately wished to gain the approval and respect of his leader Megatron (in contrast to his G1 counterpart), but started to become confused as he began to hate both himself and his commander for the abuse heaped upon him as well as being disgusted with his leader&#x27;s lack of honor and respect over his troops. He originally came to Earth as part of Megatron&#x27;s expedition to gain the power of the Mini-Cons alongside Demolishor and Cyclonus. However, Starscream&#x27;s frustration over having been made the last of the Decepticons to gain his partner Mini-Con led him to be manipulated by Sideways into battling with Megatron, which he lost. His hatred for Megatron eventually led to him siding with the Autobots so he could bring his former leader down once and for all. During his time with the Autobots, he formed a surprisingly close friendship with the human Alexis. However, Thrust eventually manipulated Starscream into rejoining the Decepticons, though Starscream still vowed to destroy Megatron.

During the Unicron Battles, Starscream was one of the five Cybertronians who received a power boost from the Mini-Cons, giving him a new blue color scheme that makes him look like Thundercracker. Despite having the original G1 Thundercracker color scheme, Starscream was never renamed into the fellow seeker but had stated &quot;I look like Thundercracker&quot; when he gained the new body colors. When Thrust was ousted as a servant of Unicron, Starscream reunited with Alexis and gave chase, though he ultimately failed to catch him. When Megatron, now calling himself &quot;Galvatron&quot;, refused to acknowledge the existence of Unicron and the potential threat he carried, Starscream challenged his leader to a duel and allowed him to stab him in the chest with the Star Saber. After a final sendoff with Galvatron, the seeker pulled the Star Saber out of his chest, exposing his spark, and fired on Unicron directly, only for the Chaos Bringer to fire a bolt of lightning that completely disintegrated Starscream, killing him. Starscream&#x27;s death ultimately convinced Galvatron of Unicron&#x27;s existence and he allied the Decepticons with the Autobots to end the threat.

In &quot;Energon&quot;, set ten years later, Alpha Q revives Starscream and wipes all memories of his old life to use him as his personal assassin. However, Megatron eventually gets a hold of Starscream, using his newfound connection with Unicron to brainwash him into his loyal second-in-command. Later in the series, he is exposed to a pool of super energon, making his armor impervious to laser fire as well as recoloring it, making him resemble his original G1 colors. In the final episode, Starscream, along with Mirage, follows Galvatron into an energon sun, Galvatron having done so to break Unicron&#x27;s hold over him.

Starscream returned again in &quot;Cybertron&quot; as a darker, more ruthless character. While he appears to be loyal to Megatron like he was in &quot;Energon&quot;, he secretly prepares a coup against him to become the leader of the Decepticons. This results in a fracturing of the group, with Starscream discovering a group of ancient Decepticons, including two named Thunderblast and Lugnutz; he also recruits neutral Transformers Sideways and Soundwave. After several encounters, Starscream and Galvatron have one final battle which ends with Starscream, Soundwave, and Sideways being transported into another dimension. He is later located by Wing Saber, who teams up with Landmine and Mudflap to go after him.

=== &quot;Transformers: Animated&quot; ===
Starscream appears in the , voiced by Tom Kenny. He transforms into a futuristic harrier jet (sporting a notable similarity to the Variable Fighters of &quot;Macross&quot; fame in his transformation sequence) and resembles his &quot;Generation 1&quot; counterpart in both design, personality, and ambitions. He flies at high speeds in both modes and wields his trademark null-rays, though these function simply as powerful lasers. He&#x27;s unintentionally comical in this incarnation displaying occasional incompetence. However, this incarnation displays a resolute tenacity towards his objective, shown by his flying around in a brutally damaged &quot;Nemesis&quot; to track down the Allspark&#x27;s energy signature for 50 years by himself. Although slightly cowardly, Starscream is an excellent warrior, since he almost single-handedly took down &quot;all&quot; of the Autobots in a battle over the Allspark. He is also more narcissistic than most incarnations of the character, frequently congratulating and praising himself, his plans, and his looks, with absolute glee.

In Season 1, Starscream betrays and tries to kill Megatron in the first episode. Megatron learns about this soon after and kills Starscream in the season finale. In Season 2, a battle between Autobots and Decepticons destroys the Allspark, but Starscream is resurrected by a shard of the Allspark that had been embedded on his forehead. Throughout the season, Starscream continues to try and eliminate Megatron, but his plans fail every time. One attempt includes Starscream&#x27;s creation of a squadron of clones of himself, each one of which embodies a side of his personality. Unfortunately for Starscream, these clones (except Thundercracker and Skywarp, who are sucked into space) eventually betray him and join Megatron. In the season finale, Starscream&#x27;s body is destroyed, reducing him to nothing more than his head. In Season 3, Starscream &quot;teams up&quot; with Megatron to conquer Cybertron and destroy the Autobots, only to betray him again after regaining his body in the season finale. However, he is stopped by Lugnut and dies after the Allspark fragment keeping him alive is removed from his forehead.

=== Aligned series ===

Starscream is part of the main group of Decepticons in the 2010 animated series &quot;&quot;. This version is depicted as a much darker character, constantly plotting his rise to becoming the Decepticon leader and mercilessly killing Autobots, as evidenced when he terminates Cliffjumper in the series premiere. He displays contempt for Decepticons who do not choose a flying alternate mode, such as Knock Out. Although he may look weak, he possesses lethal weapons such as his missiles and sharp claws and has been shown to be a master manipulator.

Throughout the first half of season one, Starscream serves as the Decepticons&#x27; leader after Megatron is critically injured and placed on life support (aided in his injuries by Starscream&#x27;s attempt to assassinate him). However, once Megatron revives, Starscream is beaten and punished, returning to his position as second-in-command. Following Megatron&#x27;s attempt to destroy Starscream, as well as his further humiliation at the hands of the Decepticon Airachnid, Starscream attempts to defect to the Autobots, only to be almost killed by Arcee after she discovers he is the one who murdered Cliffjumper, her former partner. He subsequently decides to go independent, seeking revenge against both the Autobots and Megatron.

In season two, Starscream makes several attempts to get back at the Autobots and Megatron, such as siding with the human terrorist organization M.E.C.H. and creating several clones of himself, but these all end in failure (and even result in him losing his ability to transform for most of the season), and he becomes more comedic in his ineptitude. He eventually gains a powerful Iacon relic known as the Apex Armor and also manages to obtain speed-enhancing red energon, though he loses the former to the Autobot Smokescreen. After learning of the Omega Keys, powerful Cybertronian relics that can be used to revive Cybertron, Starscream decides to steal them from the Autobots and give them to Megatron as a peace offering, wishing to rejoin the Decepticons. He succeeds and soon regains his old position as Megatron&#x27;s first lieutenant after his current second-in-command, Dreadwing, is killed. Starscream is later instrumental in the kidnapping of the Autobots&#x27; human allies, the creation of the Decepticon fortress Darkmount on Earth, and the destruction of the Autobot base.

In season three, Starscream is forced to share his high-ranking position with Shockwave and tries to earn Megatron&#x27;s respect by finding the Autobots before his rival, which results in an outbreak of energon vampires when he foolishly combines Dark Energon with unstable Synthetic Energon, resulting in the loss of over half of the Decepticon forces and the Insecticons Hive. Starscream is also distrustful of Predaking, the Predacon cloned by Shockwave to hunt down the Autobots, a feeling which is proven correct when Predaking shows he is sentient and capable of transforming. It is also he who suggests terminating the Predacon soldiers they have been creating, including Predaking, and blames it on the Autobots, later causing Predaking to turn against them after he learns the truth. In the season finale, &quot;Deadlock&quot;, Starscream helps the other Decepticons fight the Autobots when they board the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, and later witnesses Bumblebee slay Megatron with the Star Saber, before escaping with Shockwave to go into hiding. 

In the TV movie &quot;Predacons Rising&quot;, which functions as the finale to &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;, Starscream and Shockwave are the only remaining Decepticons on Cybertron, as the others have either been taken prisoners or joined the Autobots, forcing the pair to constantly move labs to avoid detection. Starscream helps Shockwave clone two Predacons, Skylynx and Darksteel, as part of their plan to rebuild the Decepticon army, and is later witness with Shockwave to the arrival of Unicron (possessing Megatron&#x27;s upgraded and resurrected body), who plans to destroy his brother Primus, who forms Cybertron&#x27;s core. Believing Unicron cannot be stopped, Starscream frees the captive Decepticons, including Knock Out, and attempts to take command of the &quot;Nemesis&quot; and flee Cybertron, but is stopped after Knock Out betrays him and sides with the Autobots. Starscream is then imprisoned along with the other Decepticons, though he eventually escapes and returns to Megatron after the latter is freed from Unicron&#x27;s control. Starscream is eager to rejoin him, but Megatron rebuffs, saying that he has lost his taste for inflicting oppression and that the Decepticons are no more. Starscream then eagerly attempts to reinstate himself as leader of the Decepticons but is confronted by Predaking, Skylynx, and Darksteel, who are intent on revenge for their cruel treatment at his hands. Starscream is last seen fleeing terrified by Skylynx and Darksteel.

In the sequel series &quot;&quot;, it is revealed that Starscream survived his encounter with the Predacons, having inadvertently killed Skylynx and Darksteel by setting off a room full of weapons. After reformatting his body, he hid until he could regain his full power, tracking seven Minicons Megatron had been experimenting on to give himself greater power than even a Prime. This led the Autobots to believe he was dead and allowed him to operate incognito. Eventually, Starscream was able to find the Minicons on Earth and hired an Insecticon and two mercenaries named Roughedge and Shadelock to retrieve them for him. He also came into possession of Megatron&#x27;s Dark Star Saber and promptly took control of it, though the sword rejected him and he could not access its full power. Nevertheless, he still desired the Minicons&#x27; power as part of his plans for revenge and galactic conquest.

After the Autobots Fixit, Jetstorm and Slipstream are captured during the hunt for the Minicons, Starscream has them brought to him. Upon learning that his old enemy, Bumblebee, is also on Earth, he threatens to terminate the Minicons unless Bumblebee surrenders to him. Bumblebee promptly does so in order to secure their release, and Starscream merges with six of the seven Minicons. Unfortunately for Starscream, Optimus Prime arrives and merges with the seventh Minicon before defeating Starscream with the help of Bumblebee&#x27;s team. After being separated from the Minicons, Starscream falls comatose and is loaded onto Optimus&#x27;s ship for transport back to Cybertron where he will face justice for his crimes.

In the 2022 show &quot;&quot;, Starscream served under Megatron during the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, until Megatron&#x27;s defection to the Autobots sometime after their arrival on Earth. He partook in the Battle of the Spacebridge, unsuccessfully trying to prevent the former Decepticon leader from hurling the AllSpark through the spacebridge back to Cybertron. Optimus Prime&#x27;s destruction of the spacebridge, as well as the loss of the AllSpark, brought the war to a swift end. 

Fifteen years later, Starscream had been captured and imprisoned in a secret G.H.O.S.T. detention facility. Undeterred, he watched with glee as recent inmate Soundwave released Ravage into the facility to perform recon. Decoy While still a prisoner, Starscream glared angrily as he watched Skullcruncher be experimented on by G.H.O.S.T.

Starscream, Nova Storm and Skywarp managed to escape G.H.O.S.T. HQ into an old cave system, where they encountered the Malto kids and were menaced by a Dweller. To his surprise, Starscream found a sympathetic ear in Hashtag, who listened to his stories of abuse at the hands of Megatron, and when the kids came up with a plan to trap the Dweller, Starscream talked the other Seekers into helping. During the attempt, they encountered Megatron, who had come into the caves in search of Starscream, and during the ensuing fight, Starscream and Hashtag were carried off by the beast. Starscream was willing to sacrifice himself to allow Hashtag to escape, but Hashtag managed to defeat the Dweller and save him. In the aftermath, Megatron offered Starscream a safe place to go, but Starscream turned him down, teleporting away with Nova Storm and Skywarp. 

Learning of Mandroid&#x27;s plan to wipe out all Cybertronian life, Starscream, Nova Storm and Skywarp returned to aid efforts to stop the mad scientist. Starscream gleefully took the opportunity for some payback on Megatron, whom Mandroid had mind-controlled to protect the superweapon he&#x27;d created. Ultimately Mandroid activated the weapon, causing Starscream and Megatron to drop lifeless from the sky, however, the pair were brought back online a short time later when Robby and Mo used their cyber-sleeves to reverse the effects.

Starscream appears in the novel &quot;&quot;, and its sequels; &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Here he and the Seekers were the bodyguards of Sentinel Prime, but captured him and pledged their allegiance to Megatron when the war between Autobots and Decepticons broke out. Starscream proved to be a treacherous subordinate as usual, looking for every opportunity to play both sides to his advantage so that his circumstances would be favorable regardless of the outcome. In an attempt to see Megatron destroyed, he released Sentinel Prime so that the deposed leader could eliminate the leader of the Decepticons, only to see Sentinel Prime fall. Starscream attacked Megatron himself but proved unable to defeat the Decepticon leader and was forced to submit to his authority again. He would join the crew of the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, and continue to seek Megatron&#x27;s overthrow through a bargain with the Quintessons.

== Comics ==

=== Marvel Comics ===
Serving as one of Megatron&#x27;s elite troops in the attack on the Ark, the Marvel Comics incarnation of Starscream possessed the desire to take leadership of the Decepticons, but in the early days of the war on Earth, he did not accomplish any notable acts apart from nearly getting scrapped by Megatron after one snide comment. When he participated in an attack on the Ark with several of his fellow Decepticons, Starscream was deactivated by Omega Supreme, and sealed in a stasis pod in the &quot;Ark&quot; for a prolonged period of time. 

At the same time, the U. K. offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines which were interspersed throughout the U.S. material. Simon Furman portrayed the character&#x27;s scheming and ambition with more subtlety than the animated series, making Starscream more intelligent and cunning. He was often the focus of his own stories, including a Christmas special based around Starscream&#x27;s misery at being stranded on Earth. In this story and in many others written by Furman, Starscream often came across as wry and sarcastic. He was one of the most formidable warriors in the Decepticon army and adversaries were often shown to be visibly intimidated by him. 

Starscream made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel &quot;Generation 2&quot; comic series; in a story called &quot;New Dawn&quot; Megatron led his Decepticons against Jhiaxus&#x27; second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron was left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.

=== Fun Publications ===
Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). Megatron survived the crash of the Ark on Earth. He is joined by Starscream, who realized he needed a leader. In Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, &quot;Games of Deception&quot; Megatron detects the arrival of Bugbite&#x27;s ship on Earth and sends Starscream, Skywarp and Ramjet to investigate. The three Seekers are then taken over by Bugbite&#x27;s cerebro shells (with Starscream swearing to painfully dismember Bugbite for it). When the Autobots eventually jam the shells to facilitate their own rescue of Mirage, Starscream is freed and battles Bugbite&#x27;s faction. Whether he survived the battle is unknown. He seems to retain his usual second-in-command status in this story. Starscream reported to Deathsaurus on the success of the Combaticons&#x27; attack on the Autobot Elite Guard.

==== Shattered Glass ====

This Starscream is a morally good version of the &quot;Generation 1&quot; character from the BotCon exclusive &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. This version is loyal to Megatron, as opposed to his normally treacherous portrayal. He longs to return to his life as a scientist. Also, Megatron treats Starscream with far more respect and considers him a genius. 

Starscream appears in the 2008 April Fool&#x27;s comic &quot;Shattered Expectations&quot; by Fun Publications. He and Razorclaw confront his world&#x27;s Goldbug, Grimlock and Jazz. When the Autobots refuse to surrender the Decepticons call in the Mayhem Suppression Squad.

Starscream then appears in the BotCon 2008 Timelines comic &quot;Transformers: Timelines&quot; story &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; as one of the troops of the heroic Decepticon Megatron. Starscream, Divebomb and Whisper drop &quot;glass gas&quot; bombs on the Autobot&#x27;s Ark launch platform to make it vulnerable to attack.

Starscream appears in the fiction &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dinobots&quot;, a text-based story from Fun Publications. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack.

The toy for the heroic Starscream is a redeco of the &quot;Cybertron&quot; Voyager Starscream and was available only in the 2008 BotCon. His color scheme is an homage to the &quot;Generation 1&quot; Autobot Jetfire. 

==== Transtech ====
Another incarnation of Starscream works in civil intelligence on Transtech Cybertron. This Starscream appeared in the Fun Publications story &quot;Transcendent&quot;, where he reported his findings on Skyfall and Landquake to Optimus Prime. Prowl and Starscream had a biographies printed by Fun Publications.

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
In the 21st-century re-imagining of the Generation One universe by the comics company Dreamwave Productions, Starscream remained his treacherous, power-hungry self. In the early days of the war on Cybertron, he devastated Iacon with a terraforming process and went on to form his own faction called the Predacons when Megatron vanished in a space-bridge experiment. 

Dreamwave Productions produced a companion comic for the G1 toyline just as Marvel Comics produced, it was different from the animated continuity. In these comics, the &quot;Armada&quot; incarnation of Starscream had a much smaller role but was written in a fashion much closer to the original treacherous G1 character - a trait that would ultimately lead to his seeming demise when the &quot;Energon&quot; comic book began. He still possessed elements of the animated Armada Starscream, such as an unwillingness to shy away from the battle.

Starscream would appear in many of Megatron&#x27;s subsequent schemes, including capturing Swindle, attempting to capture Mini-Cons for his own use, and launching an attack on the Mini-Con base on the Moon. His next appearance would be 10 years after Unicron&#x27;s defeat. When Starscream gatecrashed a meeting of the Terrorcons – renegade Decepticons who were unhappy with the peace between Autobot and Decepticon that had emerged in the wake of Unicron&#x27;s defeat – at an energon plant, his mistake soon became apparent when he discovered that they had struck a deal with Unicron and gained new &quot;Hyper Mode&quot; powers. When their leader, Scorponok, arrived, Starscream was unable to talk himself out of trouble and was blasted into the plant&#x27;s machinery by Scorponok, seemingly dying. But Starscream survived. The raw energon in the plant reacted in some mysterious way, giving him a ghostly body of pure energon (like the cartoon &quot;Energon&quot; version, this was also a homage to the ghost form of the original Starscream). In this form, he ended up attacking Demolishor and draining him of his energy. Due to the collapse of Dreamwave, the series was stopped.

=== Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing ===
In this crossover from Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra Organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers. 

=== IDW Publishing ===

After Dreamwave&#x27;s closure, the rights to the Transformers comics were taken up by IDW Publishing. Their version of the Generation One universe begins with a miniseries called &quot;The Transformers: Infiltration&quot;. His alternate mode here is that of an F-22 Raptor, foreshadowing the events of the 2007 live-action movie. 

&quot;Beast Wars Second&quot; Starscream had a biography printed in the &quot;Beast Wars Sourcebook&quot; by IDW Publishing. IDW also published a one-shot &quot;Transformers&quot; story as part of their &quot;Deviations&quot; series that heavily featured Starscream: &quot;&#x27;Til All Are One.&quot;

In this story, an alternate version of events from &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, Starscream took over leadership of the Decepticons after Optimus Prime killed Megatron. Thus, it was Starscream who first encountered Unicron and allied the Decepticons to him, after being upgraded by Unicron&#x27;s power into the mighty Megascream. He briefly hunted the Autobots in an effort to destroy the Matrix of Leadership, but later turned against his benefactor when Unicron devoured one of Cybertron&#x27;s moons, which Starscream saw as his own. When Unicron attacked Cybertron itself and Optimus Prime arrived to try and stop him, Megascream demanded that he hand over the Matrix, and combined with Astrotrain, Soundwave, Ramjet, and Dirge into a massive new form. However, Hot Rod soon arrived to rescue Optimus, and unleashed the power of the Matrix, resulting in Unicron&#x27;s demise as well as that of Megascream and himself.

=== Combiner Wars ===
In conjunction with the Combiner Wars (Unite Warriors in Japan) line, Takara Tomy released a comic detailing how the Galvatronus combiner came to be. Following his defeat at the conclusion of &quot;The Headmasters&quot;, Galvatron&#x27;s icy tomb was discovered by Cyclonus, whose body Galvatron modified to accommodate his own head in the chest compartment. Seeking a more fitting form, Galvatron directed Cyclonus to approach the disembodied head of Unicron, who was convinced to help Galvatron attain a combiner form with Cyclonus as its core. To accomplish this, Unicron used his power to open dimensional rifts in order to bring Curse Armada Thrust, Zombie War Breakdown, and Wandering Roller into their world. To Cyclonus&#x27; surprise, Starscream then made an appearance, expressing interest in joining this new alliance. Unicron promptly granted Starscream a new physical form, though half-alive-half-dead to ensure loyalty, and Galvatron&#x27;s head took control of his new minions to take on his new form of Galvatronus.

== Video games ==
Starscream appears as a playable character in Hasbro&#x27;s Net Jet fighting game &quot;Transformers Battle Universe&quot;. Although other playable Transformers have several incarnations featured, the only playable incarnation of Starscream is the Generation 1 version. He is also featured a boss in the 2004 &quot;Transformers&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2.

Starscream appears in Activision&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, based on the 2007 live-action film. He is voiced by Daniel Ross. In the Autobot campaign, Starscream appears as a boss in the second mission of the fourth chapter, where he is defeated by Jazz. In the Decepticon campaign, Starscream acts as Decepticon leader until Megatron&#x27;s resurrection and is playable in the third chapter. A color scheme for Starscream inspired by the Generation 1 version of the character can be unlocked by completing the Decepticon campaign. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, &quot;Transformers: Autobots&quot;, Starscream serves as a boss at the end of the Arctic levels, trying and failing to kill Ironhide. In &quot;Transformers: Decepticons&quot;, Starscream initially serves as leader of the Decepticon forces on Earth and Create-A-Bot&#x27;s mentor but secretly plots to seize the AllSpark for himself. After killing Bumblebee, Starscream takes the AllSpark, kills Megatron loyalist Blackout and Barricade, and battles Megatron and his disillusioned apprentice. He is eventually defeated by Create-A-Bot and then executed by Megatron for his treason. The G1 Starscream color scheme also appears as an unlockable bonus form for Create-A-Bot. 

In the sequel &quot;&quot;, itself based on the film&#x27;s sequel, Starscream acts as leader of the Decepticons following Megatron&#x27;s death, though he returns to his old position as second-in-command once Megatron is resurrected. He is playable in several levels of the Decepticon campaign, and appears as a boss, alongside Megatron, in one of the final levels of the Autobot campaign. In &quot;&quot;, which acts as a prequel to the film of the same name, Starscream (voiced by Steven Blum) is playable in the fifth level, where he intercepts and destroys a weapons transport mid-flight, battling the Aerialbots in the process. He also appears in the Nintendo 3DS and Wii versions of the game, though he is reduced to a minor supporting role.

Starscream appears in &quot;&quot;. He serves as a boss in the third and eleventh levels of the single-player campaign, fighting Bulkhead on both occasions and is playable in the multiplayer mode.

=== Cybertron series ===
Starscream appears in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;, voiced by Sam Riegel. He appears as an enemy in the level &quot;Dark Energon&quot;, as a playable character in the level &quot;Starscream&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, and as a boss in the level &quot;Defend Iacon&quot;. He is also playable in the game&#x27;s escalation mode, and his body type is available to use for the player&#x27;s multiplayer custom Decepticon scientist. Starscream also appears as a level boss in the Nintendo DS version of the game, &quot;&quot;.

Starscream is initially depicted as an Autobot Sky Commander who, following a demotion by the Autobot leader Zeta Prime, was appointed guardian of an ancient space station dedicated to creating Dark Energon. When Megatron and his Decepticons attack the station, hoping to use Dark Energon to gain an advantage over the Autobots, Starscream tries to stop them but fails. Megatron then tempts Starscream with power and, after proving capable of wielding Dark Energon, convinces him to join the Decepticons. Starscream and his fellow Seekers, Thundercracker and Skywarp, are then ordered by Megatron to reactivate an old Energon Bridge to allow the manufacture of more Dark Energon. The trio succeeds, and Starscream is later shown leading the Decepticons&#x27; aerial squadrons during Megatron&#x27;s invasion of Iacon City, the Autobots&#x27; capital. When Megatron orders the deployment of Dark Energon bombers, Starscream refuses, feeling they would be wasted, but Megatron overrides his refusal. Later, when Megatron is presumed dead while fighting Omega Supreme, Starscream wastes no time to declare himself Decepticon leader, only for Megatron to quickly confirm he is still alive and order Starscream to attack Omega Supreme as a distraction tactic. Shortly after, when the battle seems lost, Starscream is ready to sound a retreat, which Megatron overrides by threatening to execute any retreating Decepticon. In the Autobot Campaign, which directly follows the Decepticon Campaign, Starscream battles his former allies Jetfire and Silverbolt, and attacks Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Ratchet in the Decagon Plaza. However, he is forced to retreat after being injured by Optimus&#x27;s axe.

Starscream returns in the 2012 sequel &quot;&quot;, where, after Megatron is killed by Metroplex, he assumes command of the Decepticons. However, Starscream proves to be a poor leader, using most of the Decepticons&#x27; energy supplies to further his own ego, resulting in many Decepticons becoming distrustful of him. After the Autobots harvest the Energon from a destroyed Space Bridge, Starscream plans to ambush the Autobot transport carrying it and steal it for himself, but rebuffs Onslaught&#x27; warnings about the transport&#x27;s anti-aircraft cannons, resulting in most of the Decepticon aerial squadron being destroyed. Starscream orders a retreat, but the rebellious Combaticons disobey him and manage to capture the transport, albeit losing half of the Energon supply. Starscream promptly has them arrested for treachery, along with all those who defied his reign. Later, as Starscream decides to have a coronation to celebrate him becoming leader of the Decepticons (in an homage to the 1986 film), he is confronted by a revived Megatron. Megatron assumes leadership once again while Starscream is forced to flee, becoming a wanted fugitive. Starscream is playable in the level &quot;Starscream&#x27;s Betrayal&quot;, where he infiltrates Shockwave&#x27;s lab to sabotage his experiments as part of his revenge plan against Megatron, and encounters a captured Grimlock. He offers the Autobot freedom in exchange for his fealty, but Grimlock instead grabs Starscream and throws him into a control panel, freeing himself and leaving Starscream unconscious.

Starscream also appears in the 2014 game &quot;&quot;, set between the events of &quot;War for Cybertron&quot; and &quot;Fall of Cybertron&quot;. He, Shockwave, and Soundwave are ordered by Megatron to search the abandoned Crystal City for a powerful artifact called the Dark Spark, which could secure the Decepticons&#x27; victory in the war. Although they manage to find it, and even secure the loyalty of a swarm of Insecticons along the way, the Dark Spark is grabbed by the Autobots first, who escape with it. Starscream follows them, trying to recover the Dark Spark, but is attacked by the Insecticons and is unable to prevent the Autobots from boarding a train. Fortunately for the Decepticons, Shockwave rigged the train with explosives, and he and Sharpshot are able to recover the Dark Spark from the Autobots.

== Transformers Cinematic Universe ==

During the production of the live-action film, writer Alex Kurtzman stated that Starscream would not stray from his treacherous roots as he seeks to overthrow Megatron, and frequently engages in arguments with him. In the first film, he is seen vehemently pledging his allegiance to Megatron when the latter breaks free from the Hoover Dam, but unlike the other Decepticons, he is not killed in the final battle and leaves Earth at the end of the movie. Starscream transforms into a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. Starscream is armed with a rotary cannon, rocket launchers, and a saw. When in jet mode, he can simulate the presence of a human pilot, the same holographic model (referred to as &quot;Mustache Man&quot; on-set and in the credits) that &quot;pilots&quot; Blackout and &quot;drives&quot; Barricade. The actor is Air Force Major Brian Reece, a helicopter pilot instructor at Kirtland Air Force Base.
=== Role in the films ===

In 2007’s &quot;Transformers&quot;, Starscream rallies the other Decepticons to battle once Frenzy alerts them to the AllSpark&#x27;s location. Starscream disguises as an F-22 Raptor providing cover for humans in Mission City and severely injures Bumblebee. After flying through the city, Starscream attempts to take the AllSpark from Sam but is later attacked by both Ironhide and Ratchet. Ironhide takes the most damage, while Ratchet was able to hold his ground against Starscream&#x27;s attacks. He transforms back into jet mode and flies away, leaving Ironhide and Ratchet damaged. He then assists Megatron in going after the AllSpark by shooting down the helicopter that was going to extract the Cube from Sam. Later, he attacks several F-22 Raptors flying through Mission City. Due to him transforming into a Raptor himself, Starscream was able to escape the jets as they were firing back at him. After Megatron was killed by Sam, Starscream retreats into deep space.

In 2009’s &quot;&quot;, Starscream is first seen aboard the &quot;Nemesis&quot; shipwreck and is confronted by a returning Megatron, angry that Starscream left him to die. Starscream explains that he and the Fallen engineered a new army of Decepticons, but reveals to Megatron that without sufficient energon levels to feed them, the hatchlings destined to become the new army will keep dying. Later in a factory near Sam&#x27;s college, Starscream watches as Megatron plans to cut out Sam&#x27;s brain and later Optimus Prime and Bumblebee arrive. Starscream joins Megatron and Grindor in a battle against Optimus Prime in the forest, which resulted in Optimus cutting off Starscream&#x27;s right arm and ripping Grindor&#x27;s head in half, however Megatron managed to kill Optimus by stabbing him in the back and shooting his spark out. Megatron and Starscream retreat as the Autobots arrive to save Sam. Megatron berates Starscream again after failing to capture the human. During the battle in Egypt, Starscream informs Megatron about the NEST soldiers and the Autobots planning to resurrect Optimus with the Matrix of Leadership. Starscream then leads the Decepticons on the hunt for Sam and Mikaela, sends Rampage after them, and leads the assault against the Autobots and NEST. After the Fallen was killed by super-mode Optimus Prime and Megatron was badly damaged, Starscream advises his leader to escape.

In 2011’s &quot;&quot;, Starscream first appears alongside Megatron, Soundwave, and Laserbeak in Africa. He gloats about Megatron&#x27;s weakened state, which angers his master. In Washington DC, after Sentinel Prime betrayed the Autobots, Megatron and Starscream both witnessed Sentinel Prime bring an army of Decepticons to Earth from the Moon. He later shoots down the Autobot spaceship, the Xantium, after they have been exiled by the U.S. government. After the Autobots are thought to be dead, Megatron, Starscream, and Sentinel witness the city of Chicago is being invaded and attacked by a massive Decepticon army. During the battle in Chicago, he meets Sam again and mocked him. Sam uses a grappling glove that was given to him by Que/Wheeljack to take out Starscream&#x27;s right eye. Starscream then panics and sends Sam flying through the air than through a window of a nearby building. NEST soldiers led by Lennox arrive and they attack Starscream. Sam finally kills him using a boomstick given by Que/Wheeljack and stabs him in the other eye, blinding him and eventually blowing his head up.

In 2014’s &quot;&quot;, a photo of Starscream appears with a red X indicating his death.

In 2017’s &quot;&quot;, Starscream&#x27;s rebuilt head is brought by Daytrader to Cade Yeager with Daytrader puppeting Starscream&#x27;s mouth. Unamused, Cade knocks Starscream&#x27;s head aside. It is later found by Megatron who briefly laments to it before abandoning the head in Cade&#x27;s junkyard.

In 2018’s &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, Starscream appears during the battle on Cybertron in a non-speaking cameo and is commanded by Soundwave to attack the Autobots. Due to the film being a reboot and ignoring the events of the previous films, Starscream was redesigned based on his G1 incarnation and does not share any traits with the previous live-action character.

In 2024’s &quot;Transformers One&quot;, where he is voiced by Steve Buscemi, Starscream was a High Guard leader who was hiding on the surface of Cybertron after Sentinel Prime&#x27;s betrayal. Starscream’s forces captured miners Orion Pax, D-16, B-127, and Elita-1 after they escaped an ambush by Sentinel Prime. Starscream interrogated the miners until D-16 attacked and eventually subdued him, causing the High Guard to follow D-16. Shortly after, they were found and attacked by the forces of Sentinel Prime, where Starscream was captured after attempting to flee. After D-16 became Megatron, Starscream and the other High Guard immediately pledged loyalty to him. In a post-credit scene of Transformers One, it is revealed that Starscream became a Decepticon, standing by Megatron as a powerful transformer. Like in &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, Starscream&#x27;s appearance was based on his original Generation 1 counterpart and doesn&#x27;t share any traits with the previous incarnation from the Michael Bay films.

===Other media===
==== Books ====
In the prequel novel &quot;&quot;, it is revealed that Starscream is the leader of the Decepticons following Megatron&#x27;s disappearance during his search for the Allspark. He and a crew of Decepticons travel aboard the &quot;Nemesis&quot; to search for the Allspark and Megatron, although Starscream is more focused on finding the cube then his lost master. Blackout opposes him at every turn (rightly not trusting Starscream and thinking that he would prefer that they never find Megatron), while Barricade tolerates it only as a means of finding Megatron. Encountering &quot;Ghost-1&quot;, a human craft of Cybertronian design, Starscream manipulates them into revealing that Megatron and the Allspark are on Earth, then betrays them. After winning a fierce duel with Blackout for leadership, he launches a full-scale assault on the Autobots. Just as he and Bonecrusher almost kill Optimus Prime, Starscream is severely injured by &quot;Ghost-1&quot;. In retaliation, he destroys the human craft before retreating.

Starscream returns in &quot;Transformers: The Veiled Threat&quot;. With Megatron dead, Starscream eventually returns to Earth around Zambia, where he gains control over local rebel groups by using his internal synthesizers to create gold coins.

In this story, Starscream returns to Cybertron after encountering an enemy scout ship in the Eshems Nebula. After being repaired for minor damage by Ratchet, Starscream and Ironhide report to Optimus Prime and Megatron. Later, the planet is invaded by aliens from the Eshems Nebula and Starscream is among the defenders in the city of Metrotitan, near the temple at Simfur. In issue #2, he sides with Megatron in his decision to counterattack Cybertron&#x27;s invaders and is among the fleet that attacks their ships.

Starscream also appears at the end of issue #3 of &quot;&quot;, where he, Blackout and Barricade destroy the Mars &quot;Beagle&quot; probe. In issue 4, he travels to Earth, gaining his F-22 alternate mode by scanning an experimental Raptor before shooting it down.

He appears in the official movie sequel comic called &quot;The Reign of Starscream&quot;.

In &quot;Transformers: Rising Storm&quot;, it is shown that Starscream has broken away from Megatron&#x27;s rule, and formed his own army - Club Starscream - with Barricade and some others under his command. However, after blasting his way past Ruination and Deadlift, Shockwave tells Starscream that Megatron requires his services. Shockwave then sends Starscream to recover the drone called Brains.

==== Titan Magazine ====
In &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Greaming&quot; part 3, Starscream and Scorponok attack the Autobots Arcee, Armorhide, Elita One, Longarm, Skyblast and Strongarm on the moon. Starscream would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called &quot;The Decepticon who Haunted Himself&quot;. 

==== Video games ====
In the Nintendo DS &quot;Transformers: Decepticons&quot; game voiced by Daniel Ross, Starscream would kill Barricade and Blackout (and perhaps Brawl, who disappears after killing Ironhide), steal the Allspark, and betray Megatron. Starscream is fought by Megatron as the final boss after he is heavily damaged and loses the AllSpark to Create-A-Con. After being defeated, Megatron kills Starscream for being a traitor, as well as Create-A-Con for being weak. In Transformers Autobots, he is a simple boss who ambushes Ironhide and the Autobot Create-A-Bot in the Arctic but retreats after a long battle and does not reappear or heard of again. 

Starscream is among the playable characters in the 2009 &quot;&quot; video game by Activision. 

In the Nintendo DS game, &quot;&quot;, Starscream was the temporary leader of the Decepticons until The Fallen forces him to revive Megatron. 

Starscream appears in the 2011 &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; video game. As a Hunter, he can be played on Xbox Campaigne and multiplayer

Starscream is among the characters who appear in the &quot;TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game&quot;.
== Toys ==

The original Starscream toy was originally part of the Japanese Diaclone toy line and was designed by Kohjin Ohno in the early eighties. It was imported to become part of the &quot;Transformers&quot; toy line by Hasbro in 1984. The toy was later re-issued in Japan in 2001, with black-and-gold and translucent &quot;ghost&quot; variants, and again in 2003, redecorated into a more cartoon-accurate color scheme. He was also reissued in the west in 2003, with extended missiles to comply with safety regulations. Japan re-released Starscream once again in 2007 for their &quot;Encore Series&quot;. A highly prized collectable, the original Starscream toy has sold over $2000 on eBay. The original Starscream toy was altered somewhat and an electronic sound maker was added for the &quot;Generation 2&quot; toy line.

&quot;Beast Wars Second&quot; Starscream had two toys produced exclusively in Japan. In 1997 he was released as a black redeco of &quot;Generation 2&quot; Smokescreen. This same toy was recolored into &quot;Robot Masters&quot; Smokesniper. In 1998 he was released as &quot;Hellscream&quot;, a remold of &quot;Beast Wars&quot; Cybershark. This second toy was eventually released with a slight color change in the US as &quot;Universe&quot; Overbite. Hellscream was voted the ninth strangest Transformers Beast Wars figure by Topless Robots.

The &quot;Armada&quot; toy was the first new-mould Starscream figure since 1990, and it clung to tradition with a jet alternate mode and a robot form featuring many callbacks to the original Starscream figure, such as shoulder-wings, air intakes on the shoulders, a cockpit in the chest, and a head-sculpt designed to look like the original animated character. When the Mini-Con port on his backpack is pulled back and held, an electronic jet-take off noise is made. Attaching his Mini-Con partner Swindle to this port, however, unlocks his shoulder-mounted null laser cannons, and changes the sound to a repeating laser blast. Swindle can also mount under the jet-mode nosecone – by pressing the cockpit, Swindle is dropped to the ground with an accompanying electronic noise, while a press without Swindle attached yields more noises. In robot mode, Starscream&#x27;s left wing can detach and unfold into a sword for him to wield.

Starscream for the 2007 and 2009 movie had numerous toys released. He was one of two promotional figures released long before the 2007 movie as a &quot;protoform&quot;. During the 2007 film release he was sold in various size classes as a licensed F-22 Raptor replica. These toys were recolored and released as fellow Decepticons Ramjet, Skywarp, and Thundercracker. During the 2009 film, he was released as both redecos of the 2007 film toys as well as new molds. All toys of this character are officially licensed from Lockheed Martin.

&quot;Animated&quot; Starscream also received numerous toys in many size classes during the run of the &quot;Animated&quot; toy line. Many of the Starscream toys were recolored as his clones Skywarp, Thundercracker, Ramjet, Dirge and Sunstorm. In 2008 a McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal was produced with a simple transforming Starscream toy inside to promote the series. This Starscream was also released in the &quot;Universe&quot; toy as a small Legends figure, shipping with a whole wave of tiny &quot;Animated&quot; characters. In Japan the Starscream figures were released in metallic finish by Takara.

<doc id="718603" wikidata="Q5643311" url="?curid=718603" title="Halo (DC Comics)">
<text>Halo (Gabrielle Doe) is a superheroine appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. She first appeared in a special insert in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #200 (July 1983) and was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo.

The character&#x27;s origin involves spirit possession, with an alien being resurrected and possessing the body of a recently murdered woman and resurrected her. Halo initially suffers from amnesia, having no access to the memories of either the alien or the human host.

Halo has made limited appearances in other media, primarily in association with the Outsiders. She is voiced by Zehra Fazal in &quot;Young Justice&quot;.

==Creation==
Barr spoke on the genesis for the character stating,

&quot;Feeling that an attractive ingénue as a team member never hurt sales with what in those days was presumed to be a largely male audience I reached back to my fan days, and more specifically Batman #134 recalling the cover story &quot;The Rainbow Creature!&quot;, about a being whose different auras each had a different power. Combining these ideas gave us Halo&quot;

==Publication history==
Halo first appeared in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #200 (July 1983), and was created by writer Mike W. Barr and artist Jim Aparo. 

==Fictional character biography==
Halo is a gestalt of a human woman named Violet Harper and an Aurakle, an ancient energy being who originates from the Source. After Violet is murdered by Syonide, an operative of the 100 and Tobias Whale, the Aurakle resurrects, possesses, and empowers her.

Following this, Violet joins the Outsiders as Halo. She participates in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, &quot;World War III&quot;, and &quot;Blackest Night&quot; events, with the latter revealing her abilities to be effective against Black Lanterns.

In &quot;Batman Inc.,&quot; Halo joins a new team of Outsiders led by Red Robin. Following an explosion, the Outsiders are declared legally dead and use their status to perform covert missions.

==Powers and abilities==
Halo can fly and create auras of the seven rainbow colors, called halos, which have different effects. She can heal and resurrect herself and generate light, fire, holograms, and stasis beams.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Halo appears in &quot;&quot;.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Halo appears in the teaser for the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!&quot; as a member of the Outsiders.
* Halo appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Zehra Fazal. This version is the product of a Mother Box&#x27;s spirit reviving the body of Gabrielle Daou, a Quraci refugee who was kidnapped and experimented on by metahuman traffickers and euthanized by Helga Jace after testing negative for a meta-gene. Initially a blank slate with traces of Daou&#x27;s personality and memories and fleeting access to the Mother Box&#x27;s knowledge and powers, Halo is soon after rescued by Tigress, whom they live with before joining Nightwing&#x27;s team. They also name themselves Violet Harper, seeing themselves as a new individual; enter a relationship with Brion Markov; and befriend Harper Row. However, they are kidnapped by Granny Goodness, who harnesses their access to the Source to access the Anti-Life Equation before Victor Stone rescues them. In the aftermath, Halo breaks up with Markov after Zviad Baazovi secretly manipulates him into killing his uncle Baron Bedlam. In the fourth season, &quot;Young Justice: Phantoms&quot;, Halo considers converting to Islam, starts identifying as non-binary, and reconsiders their feelings towards Markov and Row. As of the fourth season finale, Halo and Row have entered a relationship.

===Film===
An alternate universe version of Halo named Aurora appears in &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot; as a minor member of the Crime Syndicate of America with powers similar to those of a Green Lantern.

=== Video games ===
Halo appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="718629" wikidata="Q733938" url="?curid=718629" title="The Real Ghostbusters">
<text>The Real Ghostbusters is an American animated television series, a spin-off and sequel of the 1984 comedy film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The series ran on ABC between September 13, 1986 and October 5, 1991, and was a joint production of DIC Enterprises in association with Columbia Pictures Television and distributed by Coca-Cola Telecommunications.

The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer.

&quot;The Real&quot; was added to the title after a dispute with Filmation and its &quot;Ghost Busters&quot; properties.

There also were two ongoing &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; comics, one published monthly by NOW Comics in the United States and the other published weekly (originally biweekly) by Marvel Comics in the United Kingdom. Kenner produced a line of action figures and playsets based on the cartoon. In 2023, events from the series would be adapted for the canon video game &quot;&quot;, in particular the character of Samhain.

== Plot ==
The series follows the continuing adventures of the four Ghostbusters, their secretary Janine, their accountant Louis, and their mascot Slimer, as they chase and capture rogue spooks, specters, spirits and ghosts around New York City and various other areas of the world.

=== &quot;Slimer!&quot; ===
At the start of the fourth season in 1988, the show was retitled to &quot;Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters&quot;. It aired in a one-hour time slot, which the show had begun doing under its original name earlier that same year on January 30, 1988. In addition to the regular 30-minute &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; episode, a half-hour &quot;Slimer!&quot; sub-series was added that included two to three short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. Animation for the &quot;Slimer!&quot; cartoons was handled by Wang Film Productions. At the end of its seven-season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of &quot;Slimer!&quot;, with multiple episodes airing out of production order.

== Voice cast ==
* Lorenzo Music – Peter Venkman (seasons 1–2)
* Dave Coulier – Peter Venkman (seasons 3–7)
* Maurice LaMarche – Egon Spengler

== Episodes ==

== Production ==
At the same time &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; was being created, Filmation was making a cartoon revamp (&quot;Ghostbusters&quot;) of their 1975 live action series &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot;, due to disagreements with Columbia over animation rights.

A short pilot episode was produced, but never aired in full. The full 4-minute promo was released on Time Life&#x27;s DVD set in 2008. Scenes of the pilot can be seen in TV promos that aired prior to the beginning of the series. Among differences seen in the promo pilot, the Ghostbusters wore beige jumpsuits as in the film and the character design for Peter Venkman bore more of a resemblance to actor Bill Murray. The character designs by Jim McDermott were dramatically different, with color-coded jumpsuits for each character. When he auditioned for the voice of Egon Spengler, Maurice LaMarche noted that while he was asked not to impersonate Harold Ramis, he did so anyway and eventually got the part. LaMarche also noted that Bill Murray had remarked off-handedly to producers that Lorenzo Music&#x27;s voice for Peter Venkman sounded more like Garfield (who was also voiced by Music at the time). Murray went on to voice Garfield in &quot;&quot; and in the 2000s after Music died in 2001. Dave Coulier took over the role of Venkman from Music starting in the third season. Coulier explained that Joe Medjuck, a producer on both the original 1984 film and the animated series, wanted the character to sound more like Murray. Ernie Hudson was the only actor from the films who auditioned to play his character in the series; however, the role was given to Arsenio Hall and later Buster Jones.

Although the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; concept was tinkered with, the finalized show does feature many tie-ins from the films. In the season 1 episode &quot;Take Two&quot;, the Ghostbusters fly to Hollywood to visit the set of a movie based on their adventures, which is revealed to be the 1984 movie at the end of the episode. The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man makes numerous appearances. During the third season, Walter Peck, the Environmental Protection Agency antagonist from the original film, reappears. The uniforms and containment unit are redesigned, and Slimer is changed from a bad ghost to a resident and friend, events which are explained in the episode &quot;Citizen Ghost&quot; that flashes back to what happened to the Ghostbusters right after the film&#x27;s events. Gozer is mentioned repeatedly throughout the series, usually in comparison to a ghost they are currently battling (e.g. &quot;Cthulhu makes Gozer look like Little Mary Sunshine&quot;).

In the third season, some of the character designs were modified. Ray&#x27;s character design was slimmed down to give the character a less overweight appearance and Slimer was given a tail instead of the formerly rounded bottom (he reverted to a stub in Season 6). The biggest change was to the character of Janine, whose hair was completely changed from being short and spiky to long and straight.Her short skirts became longer, and her small pointy eyeglasses were changed to big round eyeglasses. Her overall design was softened, as was her personality. Her voice was also softened with Kath Soucie taking over the voice role from Laura Summer. ABC also went back, and redubbed Peter&#x27;s and Janine&#x27;s dialogue in several episodes of the show with Dave Coulier and Kath Soucie, respectively. Changes to Janine&#x27;s character were eventually addressed in the season 6 episode (#118) entitled, &quot;Janine, You&#x27;ve Changed&quot;. 

Most of these changes were the result of ABC hiring a consulting firm called Q5, in an attempt for guidance on improving the network&#x27;s low ratings for their Saturday Morning lineup, a move strongly criticized by show writers J. Michael Straczynski, who was a story editor on the series and wrote episodes for every season except 4 and 7, and Michael Reaves. Many of the changes brought on by Q5 were even criticized by Straczynski as being racist and sexist, such as having each Ghostbuster have a specific role (such as a body, Peter being the mouth, Ray the heart, and Egon the brain) but making Winston (the only main African American character) the driver saying he is &quot;the hands&quot;. Another example would be stating how the character of Janine needed to be &quot;more nurturing&quot;, put her in more &quot;dress-like outfits&quot; and &quot;making her less harsh and slutty&quot;.

At the start of the series&#x27; fourth season in 1988, the opening was completely redone to center around Slimer. Eventually the episodes were expanded from their original half-hour format to last an hour, and the overall feel of the show was changed to be more youthful, with episodes having a lighter tone to be less frightening.

By season 5, Louis Tully was added to the show following the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;.

=== Voice acting and animation ===
Recording for the show took place in Los Angeles, California. The cast always recorded together, instead of separately as is custom. After recording of the dialogue was completed, sound tapes, storyboards, backgrounds, and character designs were then shipped to Japanese animation studios for animation and filming. South Korean studios were also used during the final two seasons.

== Broadcast ==
The show originally aired on ABC for its full run, except for the second season, which ran in syndication at the same time as the third season ran on ABC. Later, reruns of the show appeared on the USA Network&#x27;s &quot;USA Cartoon Express&quot; from September 16, 1991 to September 11, 1994. Fox Family Channel also reran the series from August 17, 1998 to October 1, 1999. In August 2012, reruns began airing on Fearnet during the weekends, part of their &quot;Funhouse&quot; block, and on April 1, 2017, the show began to stream on Netflix, but was removed two years later. Then the show aired in Spanish on TeleXitos from 2022 to 2023. As of June 25, 2024, the show is currently airing on MeTV Toons. It aired on ITV in the U.K. in February 1988.

To celebrate the upcoming release of &quot;&quot;, both &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; were released onto the official Ghostbusters YouTube channel.

== Media ==
&quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; soundtrack was released in 1986 on CD, records, and cassette by PolyGram Records. All songs were performed by Tahiti (Tyren Perry &amp; Tonya Townsend).

From 1986 to 1989, several episodes were released by Magic Window, the children&#x27;s imprint of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video. The episodes on the cassettes were from the first season of syndication.

In 2004 and again in 2006, Sony released bare bones episode compilations in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively. The DVD release of &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; also included two episodes of the series as bonus features, &quot;Citizen Ghost&quot;, a story focusing on events set immediately after the first movie, and &quot;Partners in Slime&quot; (this episode has the original broadcast version and the original end logos—DiC &quot;kid in bed&quot; and Columbia Pictures Television (1988) logos, respectively), which featured the psycho-active slime from &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; and a brief mention of its villain Vigo the Carpathian.

Time Life acquired the home video rights to the series in May 2008 and released a complete series on DVD in the Fall of 2008. That July they allowed fans the chance to vote between two variations of an outer box for the set—one designed to look like the main characters&#x27; firehouse headquarters and the other all black with different images on each side. Both featured lenticular printing, the firehouse version to show the Ecto-1 and the black version to have oozing &quot;slime&quot;. Released on November 25, 2008, in the &quot;firehouse&quot; casing, the set spans 25 discs containing all 147 episodes of the series. They subsequently began releasing the individual volumes on March 31, 2009, but only the first three were released. Volumes 4 and 5 were not released due to poor sales. The Time Life releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.

Sony began re-releasing the series on DVD in Region 1 in 2016. Volumes 1–5 (each containing 11 or 12 episodes) were released on July 5, while Volumes 6–10 (with 10 or 11 episodes each) were released on September 6. Unlike the previous Time Life edition, the Sony release is incomplete, missing 29 episodes that were inexplicably omitted, as well as the entire &quot;Slimer!&quot; sub-series. Additionally, title cards were removed from all episodes in the first five volumes (title and writer credits were superimposed over the animated opening). All 10 volumes, spanning 10 discs containing 111 episodes, were released in a slim plastic box set in October 2017 (comprising 80% of the series).

The complete first season was released on DVD in Australia on June 3, 2009, and in the U.K. on June 15.

== Spin-off: &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; ==

In 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; was produced by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997, and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8. Set several years after the end of &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, the series opened by saying the team has disbanded due to a lack of supernatural activity. Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system while teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon&#x27;s students, returns to manage the office. The original Ghostbusters return for the two-episode season finale to celebrate Egon&#x27;s 40th birthday, leading to them reluctantly working together with the younger generation to solve one last case.

== Reception ==
The series has received critical acclaim since its premiere. The first season received an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on five reviews. Common Sense Media gave the series a three out of five stars: &quot;Parents need to know that &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; is an animated series spun off the mega-popular 1984 movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (the &quot;Real&quot; was added to avoid confusion with an unrelated cartoon of the same name). The core characters remain the same, though the cartoon is skewed toward younger kids and as such, drops the swearing, the smoking, and the sexual innuendo. While the Ghostbusters do spend their days vanquishing evil, the monsters and phantoms they encounter are often quite silly (some of them even make wisecracks) and not too scary&quot;.

<text>Extreme Ghostbusters is an American animated television series, based on the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise, which initially aired from September 1 to December 8, 1997. A sequel to &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, which aired from 1986 to 1991 on ABC, &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; is set after that series&#x27; finale. The 40-episode series initially aired on the syndicated Bohbot Kids Network&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Block&quot; in 1997, and featured a team of college-aged Ghostbusters led by veteran Ghostbuster Egon Spengler. In some TV listings, the series was called Ghostbusters Dark.

==Plot==
Several years after the end of &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, a lack of supernatural activity has put the Ghostbusters out of business. The members have gone their separate ways except for Egon Spengler, who still lives in the firehouse, monitors the containment unit, takes care of Slimer, furthers his education, and teaches a class on the paranormal at a local college. When ghosts begin to reappear, Egon is forced to recruit four students as the new Ghostbusters: Kylie Griffin, a goth genius and expert on occultism; Eduardo Rivera, a cynical Latino slacker; Garrett Miller, a young wheelchair athlete; and Roland Jackson, a studious African-American machinery whiz. The cast also includes Janine Melnitz (the Ghostbusters&#x27; secretary, who returns to the job) and Slimer, a hungry ghost.

The series follows the next generation of Ghostbusters, who track down and capture ghosts throughout New York and (occasionally) beyond the city. A supernatural comedy, following the trend set by its predecessor, it has an updated, darker feel exemplified by a gritty, punk-inspired variation of Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s song &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as its opening theme. The song, written by Jim Latham, is performed by voice actor Jim Cummings. Throughout the series, the new team learns to work together despite their differences: Janine&#x27;s largely-unrequited affection for Egon, the unresolved love-hate relationship between Kylie and Eduardo, and the Ghostbusters&#x27; frequent clashes with authority figures who are skeptical about their work.

==Characters==
* Slimer (voiced by Billy West) – Slimer, the least-changed of all the characters in terms of personality, has a less-cartoonish look. Well-meaning, he is often pushed around by the Ghostbusters because his constant eating gets in their way. Slimer tries to fix his mistakes, often with unintended consequences. He is heroic, wielding a proton pack in &quot;Bird of Prey&quot;. Slimer is a rival of Eduardo, who (with the other Ghostbusters) cares for him despite his annoying traits. He has lived with Egon for over a decade, and they are closer than in the original series.
* (voiced by Rino Romano) – Lazy, sarcastic and apparently clueless, Eduardo is also determined and reliable; he and Garrett resemble original Ghostbuster Peter Venkman. Eduardo has a love-hate relationship with Kylie, of whom he loves. He has an older brother, Carlos &quot;Carl&quot; Rivera, an NYPD officer who resents Eduardo&#x27;s not being a police officer like the rest of their family and thinks the Ghostbusters are a scam (the reason Eduardo kept his job a secret). Eduardo has a friendly rivalry with Garrett, and his apparent laziness is due to his fear of failure. In an interview and the book &quot;Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Visual History,&quot; Rino Romano said: &quot;Spiritually, and I know this sounds kind of stupid, but I thought I was born to play that role. Eduardo was basically the lovable character. He&#x27;s in love with the girl but he&#x27;s too much of a wuss to admit it. He&#x27;s both the comic relief, the antihero, and the romantic foil. &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; was the best-written show, because it wasn&#x27;t just about the ghostbusting, it was about the characters&quot;.
* Kylie Griffin (voiced by Tara Strong, credited as Tara Charendoff) – Kylie is the only member of the new team with prior paranormal knowledge; her friend, Jack, was a victim of the Grundel. In awe of Egon when the series begins, they shift to a more equal footing. Kylie&#x27;s calm exterior often makes her a foil for Eduardo&#x27;s brashness. Her parents are divorced, and she lives alone with her cat. She was close to her grandmother Rose, who died a year before the series begins; her interest in the paranormal and her goth appearance may be related to her grandmother&#x27;s death. Kylie also appears in the IDW Publishing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; comic books, where she works at Ray Stantz&#x27;s occult book shop before becoming a Ghostbuster in 2013.
* Roland Jackson (voiced by Alfonso Ribeiro) – Roland is the most level-headed and mechanically gifted of the new Ghostbusters, helping Egon repair and improve the proton packs and Ecto-1; he joined Egon&#x27;s class after seeing the Ecto-1 at an auto show. Wanting to become an Ivy League doctor, he is slow to anger. Roland, the oldest child of a lower-middle-class family, has a mischievous younger brother he refuses to believe is a troublemaker.
* Garrett Miller (voiced by Jason Marsden) – Garret has a jock-like attitude and is a fan of extreme sports and mad stunts. Born a paraplegic, he mocks his condition and feigns helplessness to convince two FBI agents to un-cuff him. Garret is studying to be a physical therapist, but secretly dreams of being an NBA star. Bob Higgins said that in a focus group of young children, the creators found that Garrett was the most popular character: &quot;When we asked ... which of these characters would you want to be and they all wanted to be Garrett, they all wanted to be the guy that does the crazy things. They all wanted to be the guy that was the leader, and they all saw him as the leader of this group [even though he was not].&quot;
* Egon Spengler (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – The series&#x27; only original Ghostbuster, Egon mentors the new Ghostbusters team. He still lives in the firehouse with Slimer, enabling the building to become the Ghostbusters headquarters when paranormal activity resumes. Before the first ghost escaped, Egon taught classes on the paranormal at New York City College; four people took his class, double the usual number. He usually leaves field work to the new members (providing audio backup from the firehouse and information on their current adversary), but joins them when he feels that a crisis requires his presence. Egon is also interested in mold, and grows cultures in Eduardo&#x27;s bathtub when they room together. His romantic tension with Janine continues. 
* Janine Melnitz (voiced by Pat Musick) – The Ghostbusters&#x27; original receptionist is reunited with Egon in his Paranormal 101 class at New York City College. Like Egon, she supervises the new team and occasionally contributes to ghostbusting. Egon calls her the team&#x27;s accountant and collector, and her attraction to him remains unrequited: &quot;She&#x27;s spent the last decade flitting from job to job ... trying not to pine for Prof. Spengler&quot;.

==Production==
Showrunner Bob Higgins told &quot;Ability&quot; that the decision to create a new &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was made by the studio, which hoped to reinvigorate a lucrative franchise. Originally announced as &quot;Super Ghostbusters&quot; in 1996, its initial press release had Janine teaching history at a local college and bringing together a team with &quot;a hip new attitude&quot; to face a plague of ghosts; &quot;Short on time and more than a little desperate, Janine turns to four of her teenaged students.&quot; Egon was &quot;huddled in front of a computer screen, battling program bugs instead of spooks.&quot;

The show&#x27;s creators decided &quot;to put together a team of misfits in a way, people that you would not necessarily associate with being superheroes on television&quot;; Eduardo is a slacker, Roland is a &quot;square,&quot; and Kylie is moody and sarcastic. Garrett provides balance, &quot;an adrenaline junkie, who could kind of kick start the team.&quot; Designer Fil Barlow was given rough outlines and originally designed all the characters except Eduardo as girls (Garrett as Lucy and Roland as Julia), with Egon originally bearded and robed. Barlow imagined Egon as &quot;an ambassador to the ghost realm trying to stop an impending war on the other side.&quot;

During production, Lucy/Garrett was bland until producer Jeff Kline suggested putting the character in a wheelchair; Higgins said that this made Garrett more interesting to write, as he was now &quot;one of these guys that takes what he is given and makes the best of it and lives up to any potential that he has.&quot; When the character was Lucy, she was given proton-blasting calipers and crutches. Producer Richard Raynis requested a wheelchair instead; although Barlow attempted to show that a female character could &quot;be fearless and gung ho,&quot; Raynis requested the gender change. The series received an award from the Los Angeles Commission on Disabilities for its depiction of Garrett.

Other elements were changed during production: Egon replaced Janine as the teacher, Slimer lost a goblin sidekick called Gnat, and Garrett was originally Lucas. Roland was originally a clumsy &quot;gentle giant,&quot; and Eduardo dreamed of running in the Olympics. &quot;Lucas&quot; had a hair-trigger temper. The team which helmed &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; consisted of a number of producers and writers who had worked on &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; (including Raynis), and the series was a sequel of the earlier show. It was one of the few sequels of a 1980s cartoon series; &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; opted for series relaunches, but &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; opted for a more realistic passage of time. Maurice LaMarche was brought back to voice Egon Spengler, but Frank Welker and Laura Summer did not return as Slimer and Janine. The series had more explicit tie-ins to &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; as it continued. &quot;Slimer&#x27;s Sacrifice&quot; referenced Egon entering the containment unit in the &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; episode &quot;Xmas Marks the Spot&quot;; &quot;Grundelesque&quot; is a sequel of the &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; episode &quot;The Grundel,&quot; bringing back the villain and revealing that Kylie lost a friend during its first attack. &quot;Back in the Saddle,&quot; the two-part finale, featured the remaining original Ghostbusters joining their successors; Dave Coulier (the second voice of Peter Venkman), Buster Jones (the second voice of Winston Zeddemore), and Frank Welker (the voice of Ray Stantz) reprised their roles.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast==
The series initially aired on the syndicated Bohbot Kids Network (BKN) in 1997, and was aired on ABS-CBN in the Philippines two years later. It aired in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two from 19 February 1998 to 1999. The channel broadcast a short rerun in the summer of 2007. In 2021, for the upcoming release of &quot;&quot;, episodes of &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; were posted on the Ghostbusters YouTube channel.

==Home media==
In 1999, Columbia TriStar Home Video released three VHS volumes of the show. The videotapes were available to purchase separately or as a boxed set of all three volumes. The episodes included in the VHS volumes were:
* &quot;Volume 1&quot;: &quot;Darkness at Noon, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Darkness at Noon, Part 2&quot;
* &quot;Volume 2&quot;: &quot;The Infernal Machine,&quot; &quot;Grundelesque&quot;
* &quot;Volume 3&quot;: &quot;Back in the Saddle, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Back in the Saddle, Part 2&quot;

A two-disc DVD set with the first thirteen episodes of the series was released in Australia on June 2, 2009, and in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands on June 15 of that year. The UK release was edited to remove scenes of horror and threat. The series was re-released in the UK on June 27, 2016, with the first 13 episodes.

In February 2021, the episodes were uploaded weekly to the Ghostbusters YouTube channel in high definition.

On March 19, 2024, Sony released the complete series as a 9-disc DVD set.

==Reception and legacy==
In a series retrospective, &quot;SFX&quot; said that the &quot;consensus that any extension of the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; brand requires a whole new team of newbies to take on the mantle&quot;, and that &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; was its first application. The series&#x27; failure, blamed by its showrunners on poor US scheduling and the decline of non-educational children&#x27;s syndication in favor of networks such as Fox Kids and Kids&#x27; WB and cable channels (although some American stations carried the series in the 3:00–5:00 pm after-school slot), was seen by &quot;SFX&quot; as demonstrating that &quot;the appeal of Ghostbusters was only partially the concept, and that it&#x27;s the characters we love above all must be a sobering thought for anyone charged with rebooting &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; again.&quot; The series was also noted for aiming at &quot;a slightly more adolescent audience with a tougher edge,&quot; &quot;clearly intended to test the boundaries of child-friendly horror.&quot; The Eduardo/Kylie relationship pushed the edge of the ratings.

==Merchandise and other media==
The series generated a line of action figures manufactured by Trendmasters. The line included Roland, Eduardo, Kylie, several ghosts, and updated versions of Egon Spengler and the Ecto-1; Garrett did not have a figure, although collectors have found a prototype figure that went unreleased. Deluxe versions of the four Ghostbusters figures were also released, featuring electronic light and sound. A role-playing proton pack &amp; plasma blaster, standalone plasma blaster, and ghost trap with positron blaster were released alongside the action figures.

===Website===
The original website included a Flash tour of the firehouse, character profiles, descriptions of ghosts fought, and a Flash game. &quot;Spengler&#x27;s Spirit Guide&quot; contained journal entries by &quot;Egon&quot; about haunted areas and the how-to of ghostbusting. Two entries, &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot; and &quot;The Jersey Devil&quot;, appeared in episodes.

===Video games===
Three video games based on the series were created: &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; for the Game Boy Color, &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1&quot; for Game Boy Advance, and &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion&quot; for the PlayStation. There are two PC games: &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters: Zap The Ghosts!&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters Creativity Centre&quot;.

<text>Jonas Alströmer (7 January 1685 – 2 June 1761) was a pioneer of agriculture and industry in Sweden.

Born Jonas Toresson (later changed to Alström) in the town of Alingsås in Västergötland, in 1707 he became a clerk for Stockholm merchant Alberg in London. Alberg&#x27;s business failed after about three years, but Alström became a shipbroker on his own, and did very well.

Eventually he desired to establish industry back home, and in 1724 established a woolen factory in his native village, which became profitable after some initial difficulties. He then established a sugar refinery in Gothenburg, encouraged improvements in potato cultivation, tanning, cutlery, and shipbuilding.

Although Alströmer was pivotal in popularizing the cultivation of potatoes, the popular idea that he was responsible for introducing the potato in Sweden is a myth, as potatoes were grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden (in what is now the Linnaean Garden) by Olaus Rudbeck in 1658, before Alströmer was even born. Nevertheless, Alströmer himself maintained that he had brought the potato to Sweden, and his name has remained closely associated with potatoes.

He was one of the six persons who founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1739. The King made him a knight of the Order of the Polar Star in 1748, and soon after with letters of nobility, changing his name to Alströmer.

Jonas Alströmer had four sons in two marriages, Patrik Alströmer, August Alströmer (father of Anna Margaretha Alströmer), Clas Alströmer and Johan Alströmer. His son Clas Alströmer was a noted naturalist.

==Memorials==
* In 1790 he was honoured with a bust made of marble in the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building
* In 1905 he was honoured with a statue in Gothenburg
* In 1905 he was honoured with a bust in his hometown of Alingsås
* In 1961 a postage stamp marked the 200th anniversary of his passing.

<text>, also known as She, the Ultimate Weapon, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Shin Takahashi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Big Comic Spirits&quot; from December 1999 to October 2001, with its chapters collected in seven volumes.

A 13-episode anime television series adaptation by Gonzo aired from July to September 2002. A two-episode side-story original video animation (OVA) by Studio Fantasia was released in 2005. A live-action film adaptation premiered in January 2006.

Both the manga and the anime series were licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. The anime was later licensed in 2014 by Sentai Filmworks and released under the title &quot;She, the Ultimate Weapon&quot;.

==Plot==
The story begins with Shuji, a high school student in a Hokkaidō coastal city, walking up to an observatory and reminiscing about his girlfriend, Chise; there he finds her exchange diaries that she purposefully left behind. The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through flashbacks while reading Chise&#x27;s diary. Chise, a fellow student in his class, declares her love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each other.

One day, while Shuji is shopping in Sapporo, unknown bombers attack the city in broad daylight. He and his friends run for cover, but notice a fast and small flying object shooting down the enemy bombers. Separated from his friends, Shuji wanders through the wreckage—only to stumble upon Chise; here she has metal wings and weapons—apparently grafted onto her body. She tells him she has become the ultimate weapon, without her knowledge or consent, and that she is seen by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the last hope for defending Japan. In the anime, it is not apparent why Chise was chosen to be the ultimate weapon or why the country is under attack. It was not until the OVA episodes were released that an explanation for Chise being chosen was offered: her body has the highest degree of compatibility with the weapon system.

This story focuses primarily on Chise&#x27;s fading humanity as her condition worsens. The main conflict is within Chise herself; she questions whether or not she is human. Her soul is constantly trying to be a normal girl, while her body succumbs to the devastating effects of the weapon cell within her. Fundamentally important to the plot is the relationship between Shuji and Chise. From this, the resolution of the conflict follows. In the end, she is able to realize who she truly is.

A number of minor characters who do not necessarily know of Chise&#x27;s role in the war have sub-plots that concern everyday people in the context of war: a woman whose husband is constantly away from home, a school boy who joins the army to protect his girlfriend, a girl whose civilian boyfriend is killed in a bombing, and others.

==Characters==
:
:A shy, clumsy girl with very little self-esteem and has poor grades in everything except for World History. She was constantly hospitalized in Tokyo during her elementary years, and thus, has very few friends (except for Akemi). She starts dating Shuji, with Akemi&#x27;s help, and tries to make her relationship work with him despite his apparently aloof personality. However, Chise is very inexperienced and does not know much about relationships to the point she reads &quot;shōjo&quot; manga for advice. She was turned into the ultimate weapon against her will and the series revolves around her and her fading humanity. As Chise&#x27;s weapon-side starts to take over, her heart stops beating, her body lacks warmth and her sense of taste and touch are dulled, but other senses (especially sight) are accentuated. Her condition worsens and her humanity seems to fade away entirely. In the final episodes of the anime, she appears to be nothing more than a cold, ruthless machine that delights in her growing, destructive powers and killing people without mercy. Her love for Shuji is the last of her humanity. Throughout the story, she tries to come to terms with her body while still trying to convince herself that she is still human. She believes that she is nothing more than a weapon designed to kill. Her boyfriend Shuji, however, is able to help her break free by showing her that she is able to protect the ones she loves, and that only a human can experience the feeling of love. This helps Chise destroy the body in which she was trapped, and she realizes that she is indeed human. This brings to question what is meant by the term &quot;ultimate weapon&quot; used throughout the story. Chise&#x27;s soul had been the only thing that was able to destroy her body, which was claimed to be the most powerful thing in the world.
:
:A somewhat antisocial 17-year-old high school student who gets higher than average grades and used to be on his school&#x27;s track team. Shuji is very unsure of his initial feelings for Chise and feels that their relationship is more trouble than its worth, though his feelings deepen as the story progresses. Not long after the two became much closer, they decided to simply become friends again and leave their closer relationship alone. This gives him time to realize his love for Chise and he eventually wishes to give the relationship another try. However, things get complicated when his first love, Fuyumi, reappears in town. He is the only civilian who knows Chise is the ultimate weapon and promises that he will never divulge her secret. Shuji is feeling constantly guilty and useless because his irresponsible actions tend to hurt Chise. Later on in the series, he comes to accept his love for Chise and vows to protect her and be by her side at all costs.
:
:She is a childhood friend and classmate of both Chise and Shuji. Akemi is also Chise&#x27;s best friend, and usually gives her advice on love. A typical tomboy, but she has some insecurities about her appearance, always questioning why any man would fall for her. She always comes to Chise&#x27;s defense whenever Shuji inadvertently hurts Chise verbally.
:
:Shuji&#x27;s best friend. Atsushi is a mature, open, down-to-earth guy who holds a fascination for the military. He decides to join the Japan Self-Defense Forces to protect the girl he loves.
:
:Regiment leader, Fuyumi&#x27;s husband, and the sole survivor of Chise&#x27;s first platoon. He is very much like Shuji in terms of looks and personality and that is why Chise is initially attracted to him. He treats Chise like an ordinary girl, which is why Chise likes him. He is one of the characters to be featured in the OVA, where Mizuki, his former commander, was shown to have a crush on him.
:
:Tetsu&#x27;s wife. She used to train the track team when she was younger and her students called her &quot;Fuyumi-&quot;senpai&quot;&quot; because of the close age difference. She is always feeling lonely as her husband, Tetsu, is never home since he is always away in the army. It is soon revealed that Shuji and Fuyumi were once in love. Shuji explains that his love for her was never true; he simply wanted to become physically closer to her.
:
:Seen only in the OVA, Mizuki was the prototype for the weapon system which would later be used on Chise. She was an officer who was badly wounded in an attack, but returned to the battlefield because of the prototype weapon system. She also had a crush on Tetsu, her former deputy. She was one of the very few people sympathetic (and empathetic since she, too, was a weapon) towards Chise.
;Take
:The most extroverted guy in Shuji&#x27;s circle of friends and Yukari&#x27;s boyfriend. Take is the first one to get a girlfriend in Shuji&#x27;s group. His girlfriend is named Yukari.
;Nori
:The most immature guy in Shuji&#x27;s circle of friends. Nori is a naive high-school student, who believed that the war would never reach their hometown and they should stop worrying about it. He desperately wants to have a girlfriend, and is slightly jealous of Take for having one.
;Yukari
:Take&#x27;s girlfriend. After her boyfriend&#x27;s death, she leaves the school. Soon after that, she gets another boyfriend and on the surface, claims she will never love anyone seriously again.
;Takamura
:Young soldier on Chise&#x27;s former company. He admires Chise very much, telling her that her combat skills saved his life.
;Kawahara
:Head scientist in charge of Chise. He is a nervous man that perpetually wipes his forehead with a dark-blue cloth.

<text>Ray Erskine Parker Jr. (born May 1, 1954) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. As a solo performer, he wrote and performed the theme song for the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and also sounds from the animated series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. Previously, Parker achieved a US top-5 hit in 1982 with &quot;The Other Woman&quot;. Born and raised in Detroit, Parker also performed with his band, Raydio, and with Barry White in the Love Unlimited Orchestra.

== Early life ==
Ray Erskine Parker Jr. was born in Detroit, to Venolia Parker and Ray Parker Sr. Parker attended Angel Elementary School where his music teacher, Alfred T. Kirby, inspired him to be a musician at age six playing the clarinet. Parker attended Cass Technical High School in the 10th grade.

Ray Parker is a 1971 graduate of Detroit&#x27;s Northwestern High School. Parker attended college at Lawrence Institute of Technology.

== Music career ==
Parker gained recognition during the late 1960s as a member of Bohannon&#x27;s house band at the 20 Grand nightclub. This Detroit hotspot often featured Tamla/Motown acts, one of which, the (Detroit) Spinners, was so impressed by the young guitarist&#x27;s skills that they added him to their touring group. Through the Bohannon relationship, he recorded and co-wrote his first songs at age 16 with Marvin Gaye. Parker was also employed as a studio musician as a teenager for the emergent Holland-Dozier-Holland&#x27;s Invictus/Hot Wax stable, and his &quot;choppy&quot; style was especially prominent on &quot;Want Ads&quot;, a number one single for Honey Cone. Parker was later enlisted by Lamont Dozier to appear on his first two albums for ABC Records.

In 1972, Parker was a guest guitarist on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s soul song &quot;Maybe Your Baby&quot;, from Wonder&#x27;s album &quot;Talking Book&quot;, an association which prompted a permanent move to Los Angeles. He also was the lead guitarist for Wonder when Wonder served as the opening act on the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 tour. In 1973, he became a sideman in Barry White&#x27;s Love Unlimited Orchestra. Parker appeared briefly in the 1974 film &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot; as a guitar player in the church picnic scene.

Ray Parker also played guitar for Rhythm Heritage, Wah Wah Watson, Lee Ritenour, Rufus, Chaka Khan, Jaye P. Morgan (1976), Aretha Franklin (1975), Leon Haywood, Herbie Hancock, Deniece Williams, Spinners, the Temptations, and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips.

Parker&#x27;s first bona fide hit as a writer was &quot;You Got the Love&quot;, co-written with Chaka Khan and recorded by Rufus. The single hit No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts and No. 11 on the pop charts in December 1974. Parker has stated that he was the original songwriter of Leo Sayer&#x27;s 1976 hit &quot;You Make Me Feel Like Dancing&quot;, but that when he submitted the tune as a demo, his accreditation as such was missed.

In 1977, Parker created the R&amp;B group Raydio with Vincent Bonham, Jerry Knight, and Arnell Carmichael. Raydio scored their first big hit with &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, from their 1978 self-titled album with Arista Records. The song reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, earning a Gold single and Gold album in the process. Their follow-up hit, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Change That&quot;, was released in 1979 from the &quot;Rock On&quot; album. The song was another Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart during the summer and selling a million copies.

In 1980, the group became known as Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio. The group released two more albums: &quot;Two Places at the Same Time&quot; in 1980 and &quot;A Woman Needs Love&quot; in 1981, both Gold albums. In 1981, Parker produced the hard funk single &quot;Sweat (Till You Get Wet)&quot; by Brick. During the 1980s, Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio had two Top 40 hits: &quot;Two Places at the Same Time&quot; (No. 30 in 1980) and &quot;That Old Song&quot; (No. 21 in 1981). Their last and biggest hit, &quot;A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do)&quot;, released in 1981, went to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and to No. 1 on the R&amp;B Chart for two weeks that year.

Raydio broke up in 1981. Parker continued with his solo career, scoring eight Top 40 hits, including the hit single &quot;The Other Woman&quot; (Pop No. 4) in 1982 and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; in 1984. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; peaked at No. 1 for three weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart, and at No. 1 for two weeks on its Black Singles chart. The song was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1984, but lost to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot; from &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;. Parker&#x27;s song secured him a 1984 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Other hits from this period included &quot;I Still Can&#x27;t Get Over Loving You&quot; (Pop No. 12) and &quot;Jamie&quot; (Pop No. 14).
Parker also played guitar, wrote songs or produced for Cheryl Lynn (&quot;In the Night&quot;, &quot;Shake It Up Tonight&quot;, 1981), Michael Henderson (1980), New Edition (&quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;, 1984), Boz Scaggs (1980), Randy Hall (1984), Deniece Williams, and Diana Ross (1983). He performed guitar on several songs on La Toya Jackson&#x27;s 1980 debut album. He also sang the theme tune on 1984’s television series Pryor&#x27;s Place featuring Richard Pryor. In 1989, Run-D.M.C. performed a rap for the movie &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; that contained elements of Parker&#x27;s 1984 hit. 1989 also saw Parker work with actor Jack Wagner (&quot;General Hospital&quot;) on an album for MCA Records that was eventually shelved and never released. A single from the Wagner sessions, &quot;Wish You Were Mine&quot;, featuring an intro rap by Parker, was released on a 1990 MCA promotional sampler CD.

In 2006, Parker released a new CD titled &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;. In 2014, he was invited by producer Gerry Gallagher to record with Latin rock musicians El Chicano, as well as Alphonse Mouzon, Brian Auger, Alex Ligertwood, Siedah Garrett, Walfredo Reyes Jr., Spencer Davis, Lenny Castro, Vikki Carr, Pete Escovedo, Peter Michael Escovedo, Jessy J, Marcos J. Reyes, Salvador Santana, and David Paich. In July 2016, Parker performed on the ABC network&#x27;s television show &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

Parker is also the founder and owner of the Los Angeles–based recording facility Ameraycan Recording Studios. Parker received a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014.

In 2022, Parker competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Sir Bug a Boo&quot;. After being eliminated on &quot;Fright Night&quot; alongside the forfeiting of Linda Blair as &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, he performed the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme as an encore.

=== &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme song lawsuit ===
In 1984, Huey Lewis sued Columbia Pictures and Parker, stating that the melody to the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme song infringed on the copyright of the Huey Lewis and the News song &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;, which had been released on their album &quot;Sports&quot; the previous year. The three parties reached a settlement in 1995 which forbade them from revealing any information that was not included in a press release they jointly issued at the time. In March 2001, Parker filed a suit against Lewis for breaching the part of the settlement which prohibited either side from speaking about it publicly.

== Music videos ==
Parker was one of the first black artists to venture into the then-fledgling world of music videos. In 1978, Hollywood producer Thom Eubank produced several music videos of songs from Raydio&#x27;s first, eponymous album on Arista Records. The single &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot; was the first released to air on Wolfman Jack&#x27;s Saturday night television show, &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. The music videos were also transferred to film and projected in movie theaters all over Europe. He also made two different videos for his hit &quot;The Other Woman&quot;. The first was Halloween-themed and centered around a haunted castle with dancing corpses and vampires. The second was more performance-oriented, with Parker performing the song against an outer space background with backup singers. Parker&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; video, helmed by the film&#x27;s director, Ivan Reitman, was one of the first movie-themed videos to find success on MTV.

== Acting ==
In addition to &quot;Uptown Saturday Night&quot;, Parker also made acting appearances on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break&quot;, 1984 CBS Saturday morning kids&#x27; show &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot; (for which Parker appeared in the opening title sequence singing the theme song), two episodes of &quot;Berrenger&#x27;s&quot; (1985), &quot;Charlie Barnett&#x27;s Terms of Enrollment&quot; (1986) (V) aka &quot;Terms of Enrollment &quot;(USA: short title), &quot;Disorderlies&quot; (1987), &quot;Enemy Territory&quot; (1987). He was also a production assistant for the film &quot;Fly by Night&quot; (1993). He made guest appearances on &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;. In early 2009, Parker appeared in a television advertisement for 118 118, a British directory enquiries provider. This featured Parker singing a 118-specific version of the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme song.

On April 15, 2009, Parker&#x27;s 118 theme song was made available as a downloadable ringtone from the 118 118 mobile website. In 2014, Parker appeared in the fifth episode of the first season of NBC&#x27;s romantic comedy television series &quot;A to Z&quot;, singing the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme song for a Halloween party. Parker was highlighted on TV One&#x27;s series &quot;Unsung&quot;, in the fifth season.

<doc id="718661" wikidata="Q663258" url="?curid=718661" title="Spanish March">
<text>The Spanish March or Hispanic March was a march or military buffer zone established c. 795 by Charlemagne in the eastern Pyrenees and nearby areas, to protect the new territories of the Christian Carolingian Empire—the Duchy of Gascony, the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Septimania—from the Muslim Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in al-Andalus.

In its broader meaning, the &quot;Spanish March&quot; sometimes refers to a group of early Iberian and trans-Pyrenean lordships or counts coming under Frankish rule. As time passed, these lordships merged or gained independence from Frankish imperial rule.

==Geographical context==
The area of the Spanish March broadly corresponds to the eastern regions between the Pyrenees and the Ebro. The local population of the march was diverse. It included Basques in its northwestern valleys, the Jews of Occitania, and a large Occitano-Romance-speaking population governed by the Visigothic Code, all of them under the influence of al-Andalus since their lords had vowed allegiance to the Umayyad Córdoban rulers in 719, until King Pepin the Short of Francia conquered Septimania in 759. The Pyrenean valleys started to switch loyalties after 785 (Girona, Ribagorza, etc.).

The territory of the Spanish March changed with the fortunes of the empires and the feudal ambitions of those, whether counts or walis, who were appointed to administer the counties. Though owing loyalty to the Carolingian monarch, the counts became largely autonomous. Out of the welter of counties in the march, many would be absorbed by more powerful counties, leading to the predominance of the County of Barcelona, from which, along with its vassal counties, would emerge the Principality of Catalonia centuries later. Other Spanish March counties would later be absorbed into the kingdoms of Aragon or France. Only Andorra, between modern France and Spain, retained its independence. 

Counties that at various times formed part of the Spanish March included Ribagorza (initially including Pallars), Urgell, Cerdanya, Peralada, Empúries, Besalú, Osona, Barcelona, and Girona. The Gothic March included Conflent, Roussillon, Vallespir and Fenouillet. 

The nominal boundaries attributed to the Spanish and Gothic marches vary in time and not without confusion. Also, Navarre and Aragon have sometimes been depicted as being within the Spanish March, but formally they were not. However, they came under Carolingian overlordship between 794 and 806 as part of the Duchy of Vasconia (Gascony).

==History==

With the exception of the Visigothic province of Septimania and some territories in the mountains of northern Hispania, the Umayyad conquest of the Visgothic Kingdom of Hispania was largely complete by 718. In 719, the Umayyad forces of al-Samh ibn Malik bypassed the Pyrenees by marching along the Mediterranean coast to conquer Septimania and established a fortified base at the city of Narbonne. Umayyad control of this frontier province was secured by offering the local population generous terms, intermarriage between ruling families, and treaties. Further Umayyad expansion northward was halted by al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlanis defeat at the Battle of Toulouse in 721. Wālis were installed in Girona and Barcelona.

Umayyad forces based in Septimania then launched raids on their neighbours to the north and east, reaching as far as Autun. Peace was signed in 730 between the victor at Toulouse, the Duke of Aquitaine, and Munuza, a Berber rebel Muslim lord based in Cerdanya (in current-day Catalonia), a region that could act as a buffer zone against Umayyad expansionism. The peace treaty was sealed with the marriage of the Duke’s daughter to Munuza. However, Munuza was defeated by an Umayyad military expedition in 731 during another Umayyad expansion.

The Spanish March was to be the result of the southward expansion of the Frankish realm from its heartland in Neustria and Austrasia starting with Charles Martel in 732 after various decades of fighting between the Franks and Umayyads or &quot;Saracens&quot;.

The Dukes of Aquitaine (including Vasconia) pledged formal allegiance to the kings of the Franks several times, Odo the Great in 732 and Hunald I in 736 after being defeated, but remained independent. In 737, Charles Martel led an expedition to the lower Rhône and Septimania, possibly seeing that the Umayyad thrust was threatening his grip on Burgundy, which had just been subdued in 736, but he failed to keep the region.

Both Aquitaine and Septimania were still out of Frankish control after Charles&#x27;s death, but Pepin the Short was determined to subdue southern Gaul. In 759, after conquering Septimania from the Umayyads, the Carolingian king focused all his might in crushing Aquitanian resistance to central Frankish power. After a ruthless war of eight years, Aquitainian independence came to an end. Toulouse was now under the grip of the new Carolingian king, Charlemagne, and access to al-Andalus was open to him despite sporadic rebellions in Vasconia over the next two decades (Basques subdued in 790 by Charlemagne&#x27;s new loyal strongman in Toulouse, William of Gellone).

The first county to be established by the Franks from the territory taken from the Muslims was Roussillon (with Vallespir) circa 760. In 785 the county of Girona (with Besalú) to the south of the Pyrenees was taken. Ribagorza and Pallars were linked to Toulouse and were added to this county circa 790. Urgell and Cerdanya were added in 798. The first records of the county of Empúries (with Perelada) are from 812 but the county was probably under Frankish control before 800.

Pepin&#x27;s son, Charlemagne, fulfilled the Carolingian goal of extending the defensive boundaries of the empire beyond Septimania, creating a strong barrier between the Umayyad Caliphate and Francia, besides tightening control over the Duchy of Vasconia by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine, ruled by his son Louis the Pious in 781.

After a series of struggles the County of Barcelona (with Ausona) was taken by Frankish forces in 801. A number of castles were established in Aragon between 798 and 802 (appointment by Count Aureolus). After subduing the Basques to the north of the Pyrenees (790), Frankish overlordship expanded to the upper Ebro (794) and Pamplona (798), when Alfonso II of Asturias also came under Charlemagne&#x27;s influence. Sobrarbe was not incorporated into the march, as it appears later in history and was probably within the area of influence of the County of Aragon.

The death of Charlemagne (814) was followed by a scene of open revolt and Carolingian setbacks around the Pyrenees. After being defeated by the Moors in the 816 Battle of Pancorbo, Pamplona, now led by the Basque lord Iñigo Arista broke away from the Spanish March, with the County of Aragon following suit shortly thereafter in 820. The counties to the south, which were used by the Moors to enter and overrun Visigothic Septimania in 719, became, at this point, a natural extension of the March of Gothia ruled by local counts under the Carolingian Empire.

==Structure==

The local population of the Spanish March was diverse. The majority were Hispano-Romans (Goths) and Basques but there were also Muslims, and Jews from Septimania who repopulated the Frankish conquered easternmost territories of present-day northern Spain and a small portion of southern France. The area changed with the fortunes of the empires and the feudal ambitions of the counts appointed to administer the counties. As Frankish imperial power waned, the rulers of the March of Hispania became independent fiefs. Most of the region would later become part of Catalonia.

Charlemagne&#x27;s son Louis the Pious took Barcelona from its Moorish ruler in 801, thus securing Frankish power in the borderland between the Franks and the Moors. The Counts of Barcelona then became the principal representatives of Frankish authority in the Spanish March. The march included various outlying smaller territories, each ruled by a lesser &quot;miles&quot; with his armed retainers and who theoretically owed allegiance through the count to the emperor.

The rulers of the counties were called &quot;counts&quot; and when they governed several counties they often took the title of &quot;duke&quot; (Dux Gothiae). When the county formed the border with the Muslim Kingdom, the Frankish title &quot;marquis&quot; (Marquis de Gothie) was chosen. Besides, certain counts aspired to the Frankish title &quot;Prince of Gothia&quot;. A margrave or &quot;Marcgravi&quot; is a &quot;Graf&quot; (&quot;duke&quot;) of the March. The later &quot;Toulousain&quot; and &quot;Catalan&quot; lords, such as Bernard of Septimania, Humfrid, Bernard of Gothia, Borrell II, and Ramon Borrell, inherited these titles.

In the early 9th century, Charlemagne began issuing a new kind of land grant, the &quot;aprisio&quot;, which reallocated land previously held by the imperial crown fisc in deserted or abandoned areas. This included special rights and immunities that allowed considerable independence from the imperial control. Historians have interpreted the &quot;aprisio&quot; both as an early form of feudalism and in economic and military terms as a mechanism to entice settlers to a depopulated border region. Such self-sufficient landholders would aid the counts in providing armed men to defend the Frankish frontier. &quot;Aprisio&quot; grants (the first ones were in Septimania) were given personally by the Carolingian king, so that they reinforced loyalty to central power, to counterbalance the local power exercised by the march&#x27;s counts.

However poor communications and a distant central power allowed these basic feudal, heavily agrarian entities to be self-sufficient. Each was ruled by a small hereditary military elite. For example, the first Count of Barcelona Bera was appointed by the King in 801, however subsequently strong heirs were able to inherit the title such as Sunifred, fl. 844–848. This gradually became custom until countship became hereditary (for Wifred the Hairy in 897). The County of Barcelona became &quot;de facto&quot; independent under count Borrell II, when he ceased to request royal charters after the kings Lothair and Hugh Capet failed to assist him in the defense of the county against Muslim leader al-Mansur, although the change of dynasty may have played a part in that decision; meanwhile other counties maintained links with the Frankish crown for a longer time. 

The early history of Andorra in the Pyrenees provides a fairly typical example of a lordship of the region, as Andorra is the only part of the Spanish March that was never incorporated into either France or Spain, a feat mentioned in its national anthem, &quot;El Gran Carlemany&quot;.

<text>Sir John Shaw Rennie (12 January 1917 – 12 August 2002) was a British civil servant. He was Commissioner-General for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East from 1971 to 1977.

== Biography ==

John Rennie was born in Glasgow and educated at Hillhead High School, Glasgow University and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1951 Rennie was appointed Britain&#x27;s deputy colonial secretary for Mauritius. He was the British Resident in the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) from 1955 to 1962.

From 1962 to 1968, he was Governor of Mauritius, overseeing Mauritius&#x27;s transition to independence, including initiating discussions with Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the Mauritian premier, over the detachment of the Chagos Islands from Mauritian territory.

From 1968 to 1971, Rennie was UNRWA deputy commissioner-general under Laurence Michelmore, who persuaded the then UN secretary-general U Thant to appoint Rennie as his successor.

Rennie married Winifred McAlpine Robertson on 26 February 1946. The couple had one son.

<doc id="718668" wikidata="Q3759476" url="?curid=718668" title="General Electric Theater">
<text>General Electric Theater is an American anthology series hosted by Ronald Reagan that was broadcast on CBS radio and television. The series was sponsored by General Electric&#x27;s Department of Public Relations.

==Radio==
After an audition show on January 18, 1953, titled &quot;The Token&quot;, with Dana Andrews, the radio series, a summer replacement for &quot;The Bing Crosby Program&quot;, debuted on CBS on July 9, 1953, with Ronald Colman in an episode based on &quot;Random Harvest&quot;. With such guest stars as Cary Grant, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Jane Wyman, William Holden, Alan Young, Dorothy McGuire, John Hodiak, Ann Blyth, James Mason, Joan Fontaine, and Judy Garland the series continued until October 1, 1953. Jaime del Valle produced and directed the show. Ken Carpenter was the host and announcer. Wilbur Hatch supplied the music.

Also known as &quot;G.E. Stereo Theater&quot;, the program &quot;was the first network radio series to be broadcast on FM in stereo.&quot;

==Television==
The television version of the program, produced by MCA-TV/Revue, was broadcast every Sunday evening at 9:00 pm EST, beginning February 1 1953, and ending June 3 1962. Each of the estimated 209 television episodes was an adaptation of a novel, short story, play, film, or magazine fiction. An exception was the 1954 episode &quot;Music for Christmas&quot;, which featured choral director Fred Waring and his group The Pennsylvanians performing Christmas music. Jacques Tourneur directed four episodes, &quot;The Martyr&#x27;&quot; (1955), &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1955), &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1960) and &quot;Star Witness: The Lili Parrish Story&quot; (1961). The April 24, 1960, episode, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Apples&quot;, was the pilot for the situation comedy &quot;Ichabod and Me&quot;, which aired on CBS during the 1961–1962 television season.

On September 26, 1954, Ronald Reagan debuted as the only host of the program. GE added a host to provide continuity in the anthology format. The show&#x27;s Nielsen ratings improved from #27 in the 1953–1954 season to #17 in 1954–1955, followed #11 in 1955–1956, #3 in 1956–1957, #7 in 1957–1958, #26 in 1958–1959, #23 in 1959–1960, and #20 in 1960–1961.

Reagan&#x27;s contract with GE also entailed work as a motivational speaker for the company. After eight years as host, Reagan estimated he had visited 135 GE research and manufacturing facilities, and met over 250,000 people. During that time, he would also speak at other forums such as Rotary clubs and Moose lodges, presenting views on economic progress that in form and content were often similar to what he said in introductions, segues, and closing comments on the show as a spokesman for GE. Reagan, who would later be known as &quot;The Great Communicator&quot; because of his oratorical ability, often credited these engagements as helping him develop his public-speaking abilities.

Kennedy pressured GE to cancel &quot;The General Electric Theater&quot; or at least to fire Reagan as the host if the program were to continue. The series was not dropped because of low ratings but political intervention, the younger Reagan still maintains. Michael claimed that Robert Kennedy told GE officials that the company would receive no federal contracts so long as Reagan was host of the series. Michael noted the irony that his father&#x27;s dismissal propelled Reagan into the political arena, and eighteen years afterwards, Reagan would take the oath of office as U.S. president. Kennedy&#x27;s directive is another example of the &quot;law of unintended consequences&quot;. Had Kennedy stayed out of GE contract matters, likely there would have been no Governor or President Reagan.

From &quot;Reagan: The Life&quot;, H.W. Brands, Anchor Books, New York 2015

Page 124–125: Reagan&#x27;s jeremiads against encroaching government cited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) as a case in point – until he got wind that TVA executives were listening and wondering to General Electric&#x27;s boss, Ralph Cordiner, why they shouldn&#x27;t shift their purchases to a more appreciative company. Cordiner said he wouldn&#x27;t censor Reagan – a move that caused Reagan to censor himself. Reagan recalled saying: “Mr Cordiner, what would you say if I could make my speech just as effectively without mentioning TVA?” [He also recalled the response:] “Well, it would make my job easier.” Reagan concluded the story “Dropping TVA from my speech was no problem.” [This quote is taken directly from Where&#x27;s the Rest of Me?, Ronald Reagan with Richard G. Hublen, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York, 1965, pp. 269–270]

Page 131: In 1961, the Justice Department launched a probe into price-fixing in the electrical equipment industry. General Electric was a prime target. Corporate management decided prudence lay in avoiding anything that raised the company&#x27;s profile needlessly. Reagan&#x27;s attacks on big government did just that. ... The company offered to keep him on pitching commercial products if he would stop talking politics. ...He decided the reduced stage was too small.

From &quot;An American Life&quot;, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1990, page 137: “In 1962, there was a change in management at General Electric that brought an end to my satisfying eight-year relationship with the company. Ralph Cordiner was retiring and the new management asked me, in addition to continuing as host of the &quot;GE Theater&quot;, to go on the road and become a pitchman for General Electric products – in other words, become a salesman. I told them that after developing such a following by speaking out about the issues I believed in, I wasn&#x27;t going to go out and peddle toasters.

From &quot;When Character was King&quot;, Peggy Noonan, Penguin, New York, 2001, page 84:, New management asked him to stay on...but go on the road and pitch GE products. They insisted. He said no. They cancelled.

Don Herbert, a television personality well known as the host of &quot;Watch Mr. Wizard&quot;, appeared as the &quot;General Electric Progress Reporter&quot;, adding a scientific touch to the institutional advertising pitch. The show was produced by Revue Studios, whose successor-in-interest, NBC Universal Television, was co-owned by GE.

Following &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;″s cancellation in 1962, the series was replaced in the same time slot by the short-lived GE-sponsored &quot;GE True&quot;, hosted by Jack Webb.

On March 17, 2010, General Electric presented Reagan&#x27;s widow Nancy Davis Reagan with video copies of 208 episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, to be donated to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

On April 20, 2010, a &quot;lost&quot; live episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; – &quot;The Dark, Dark Hours&quot;, which originally aired on December 12, 1954 – was uncovered by NBC writer Wayne Federman, who was working on a television retrospective for the Reagan Centennial Celebration. The episode was noteworthy because it teamed Ronald Reagan with James Dean. Highlights were broadcast on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

<text>Sir Arthur Leonard Williams (22 January 1904 – 27 December 1972) was a British politician who was General Secretary of the Labour Party during the 1960s.

== Early life ==
Born in Liverpool in 1904, he began working on the steam engines of the railway as a boy, doing the dirty jobs of cleaning out the ashes and the boilers on the engines. He became involved in the union movement after World War I, rising through various positions to attain the position of General Secretary of the British Labour Party. After retiring from that post he was knighted and appointed Governor-General of Mauritius in 1968 and served in that capacity until his death. He was also involved in the Scout movement.

He was married to Margaret Wiggins. There were no children of the marriage.

<text>Sir (William) Henry Garrioch (4 May 1916 – 18 February 2008) was the acting governor-general of Mauritius from 31 October 1977 until 23 March 1978.

== Legal career ==

Garrioch joined the Colonial Service in 1936 and was subsequently appointed a First Grade Clerk in 1946, when he was picked to be a judge&#x27;s secretary. He became the secretary of Justice Georges Espitalier-Noël, who was able to persuade Chief Justice Sir Francis Herchenroder that Garrioch should be encouraged to embrace a legal career.

Garrioch took the advice and won the Colonial Scholarship enabling him to complete his studies in law in the United Kingdom. He was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn and to the Mauritian Bar in 1952.

On his return to Mauritius, Garrioch was immediately appointed to the post of Crown counsel, at a time in the 1950s when it was the chief justice who advised the governor on the appointment of Law Officers and District Magistrates. The established practice at that time was that members of the bar who were to join the public service had to first be appointed district magistrates; only those thought to be of the highest caliber were then transferred to the Attorney-general&#x27;s Office.

Garrioch moved up in the office to become Director of Public Prosecutions, which at the time was higher in the legal hierarchy than solicitor-general. He was made a judge of the Supreme Court in 1967.

== Mauritian constitution and role in independence ==

In 1963, when the colonial secretary dispatched his chief legal adviser, Anthony Rushford Q.C., in order to finalize the draft of what was to become the Mauritian constitution of 1964 (which was to be the basis for their Independence Constitution of 1967), Rushford asked Mauritius to provide the services of its best legislative draftsman to be his counterpart. The Mauritian authorities selected Garrioch, who spent several weeks at Le Réduit to finalize the draft before it went to Her Majesty in Council.

Following Sir Maurice Latour-Adrien&#x27;s retirement Henry Garrioch was appointed Chief Judge of Mauritius on 20 April 1977 at the age of 61. When Sir Raman Osman retired as Governor-General of Mauritius at the end of October 1977, Garrioch was appointed acting governor general, in line with the tradition of making the chief judge serve as chief administrator of the government.

== Honours ==

Garrioch was knighted on 31 December 1977.

<text>Sir Dayendranath Burrenchobay, KBE, CMG, CVO, GCSK (24 March 1919 – 29 March 1999) was born in Plaine Magnien, Mauritius and served as the fourth governor-general of Mauritius.

==Early life and education==
Dayendranath Burrenchobay grew up in Cemetery Road, Plaine Magnien. He travelled to London, England to further his education. Later he graduated from Imperial College, London.

==Career==

After graduating from Imperial College, London he worked for the British Electricity Authority. On his return to Mauritius he joined the Civil Service as a teacher. He eventually became Permanent Secretary at Ministry of Education &amp; Cultural Affairs (1964-1967). This was followed by his appointment at Permanent Secretary at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (1967-1976). He also was Chairman of the Central Electricity Board (Mauritius) (CEB) (1968-1976). He became Head of the Civil Service and in 1976 he was knighted. Over the same period he was Secretary of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute (MGI).

==Legacy==

On 17 May 1984, the Sir Dayendranath Burrenchobay Foundation Act was enacted in Parliament with the objectives of promoting and encouraging research in all fields and to reward and financially assist works of importance to the economic, social and cultural development of Mauritius.

==Appointment as Governor-General==

Dayendranath Burrenchobay was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II to hold the office of Governor-General after Henry Garrioch&#x27;s retirement. Thus Burrenchobay became the third Mauritian to hold the position of Governor-General of Mauritius following previous Mauritians Sir Michel Rivalland (1968), Sir Raman Osman (1973-1977) and Sir Henry Garrioch (1977-1978). During his term as Governor General from 1978 to 1983 he oversaw two governments, first under Prime Minister Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and then when Sir Anerood Jugnauth became prime minister. Burrenchobay was succeeded by Seewoosagur Ramgoolam himself.

<text>Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (18 September 1900 – 15 December 1985), often referred to as Chacha &quot;Uncle&quot; Ramgoolam or SSR, was a Mauritian physician, politician, and . He served as the island&#x27;s only chief minister, first prime minister, and fifth governor-general.

He is widely recognized as the nation&#x27;s founding father. After Guy Rozemont&#x27;s death in 1956, Ramgoolam served as the leader of the Labour Party of Mauritius until his death in 1985 and led the country to independence in 1968.

His son, Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, has served as prime minister of Mauritius in the past and currently occupies the office.

==Early life==
Seewoosagur &quot;Kewal&quot; Ramgoolam, was born on 18 September 1900 at Belle Rive, Mauritius, in the district of Flacq in a Bhojpuri speaking Hindu Indo-Mauritian family. His father, Moheeth Ramgoolam also known as Mohit Mahto was an Indian immigrant labourer belonging to the Koeri(Kushwaha) broader Vaishya community. Moheeth came to Mauritius aged 18 in a ship called &quot;The Hindoostan&quot; in 1896. His elder brother, Ramlochurn, had left the home village of Harigaon in the Bhojpur district of Bihar in search of a better life abroad. Moheeth worked as an indentured labourer and later became a Sirdar (overseer) at Queen Victoria Sugar Estate. When he married Basmati Ramchurn in 1898, he moved to Belle Rive Sugar Estate. Basmati was a young widow born in Mauritius. She already had two sons: Nuckchadee Heeramun and Ramlall Ramchurn.

Ramgoolam had his early grounding in Bhojpuri, Indian culture and philosophy, in the local evening school of the locality (called &quot;Baitka&quot; in Mauritian Hindu term), where children of the Hindu community learnt the vernacular language and glimpses of the Hindu culture. The teacher (guruji) would teach prayers and songs. Sanskrit prayers and perennial values taken from sacred scriptures like the &quot;Vedas&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Upanishads&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; were also taught.

He enrolled in the neighbouring R.C.A. (Roman Catholic Aided) School, run by Madame Siris without his mother&#x27;s knowledge. He learned History, Geography, English and French. After leaving the pre-primary school, he went to Bel Air Government School, travelling by train, until he passed the sixth standard. At the age of seven, Ramgoolam lost his father and at the age of twelve, he suffered a serious accident in a cowshed that cost him his left eye. He continued his scholarship class at the Curepipe Boys’ Government School while taking up boarding with his uncle, Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth, a sworn land surveyor, in Curepipe. He would listen to the political discussions between his uncle and his circle of friends on local politics and on the current struggle for Indian independence under Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rash Behari Bose. These initial conversations were to form the basis of his political beliefs years later. The scholarship classes, which formed the basis of lower secondary schooling, permitted Ramgoolam to go straight for the Junior Cambridge at the Royal College, Curepipe, where he was educated by the likes of Reverend Fowler and Mr Harwood. After secondary school, Ramgoolam worked for 3 months in the Civil Service.

With the financial help of his brother Ramlall, Ramgoolam was able to initiate medical studies in England. In 1921, Ramgoolam set sail on one of the ships of the Messageries maritimes for Marseille, and continued by train to London, his final destination, with a transit of a couple of days in Paris. In the French capital he purchased copies of the books of André Gide and André Malraux with both of whom he struck friendship. He graduated from University College London and attended lectures at the London School of Economics.

==Political career==

=== Pre-independence ===
In 1935, he returned to Mauritius after completing medical studies in London and Seewoosagur worked to improve the living and working conditions of the bulk of the island&#x27;s population which consisted of the descendants of indentured Indian laborers and enslaved Africans. After joining Edgar Laurent&#x27;s party &quot;Union Mauricienne&quot; and Jules Koenig&#x27;s &quot;Groupement des Douze&quot;, it was in 1947 that Ramgoolam joined the Labour Party a short time before the 1948 General Elections. Ramgoolam realised the increasing popularity of the new Labour Party leader Guy Rozemont, who succeeded Emmanuel Anquetil in 1946. Up to that time the Labour Party had been under the leadership of its original founders Emmanuel Anquetil, Maurice Curé, Pandit Sahadeo, Renganaden Seeneevassen and Mamode Hassenjee, Jean Prosper, Barthelemy Ohsan, Samuel Barbe and Godefroy Moutia who initiated the party in 1936. In September 1940 and during the Second World War he became one of the founders of the Labour Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Advance&quot; which advocated universal suffrage, economic reform and social justice. Ramgoolam wrote a series of articles using pseudonym &quot;Thumb Mark II&quot; which challenged the island&#x27;s established conservative sugar oligarchs. He was also appointed as President of the group known as &quot;Indian Cultural Association&quot;. On 5 February 1938 Seewoosagur Ramgoolam was initiated into the masonic fraternity. On 24 November 1975 during a trip to Paris he joined &quot;Loge Mozart&quot; and on 1 April 1976 he was present at the &quot;Chambre Symbolique&quot; of the &quot;Loge de la Triple Espérance&quot; where he was awarded the honorary title of 33rd Degree of Scottish Rites. His involvement assisted in the bi-centenary celebrations of Freemasonry in Mauritius in 1976.

From 1940 to 1953, he was an elected Municipal Councillor in Port Louis and was re-elected to serve from 1956 to 1960. Then he was elected Deputy Mayor of Port-Louis in 1956 and became Lord Mayor of Port Louis in 1958. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam served as Nominated Member of the Legislative Council from 1940 to 1948. At the 1948 General Elections, he was elected Member of Legislative Council for Pamplemousses-Rivière du Rempart as an independent candidate. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 1953, 1959 (Triolet) and 1967 (Pamplemousses-Triolet). In 1948 and 1953 he was also appointed as member of the Executive Council. From 1951 to 1956 he joined the Civil Service to work as Liaison Officer for Education before becoming first MLA for Pamplemousses-Triolet in December 1956. In 1958 the Colonial Government appointed him as Ministerial Secretary to Treasury.

He led the Mauritian Labour Party from 1959 to 1982 following the death of Guy Rozemont in March 1956.

At the 1961 Constitutional Conference in London, the Parti Mauricien was in favour of an integration with Britain rather than independence within the Commonwealth. But Britain, at that time, had already decided that it would give up all its colonies with the exception of Hong-Kong, Gibraltar and the Falklands. In fact, the die had already been cast as early as 1959 when Harold Macmillan had made his famous “Wind of change blowing over Africa” speech. After the general election of 1963, Gaetan Duval, then deputy-leader of the Parti Mauricien, again lobbied for Integration with Britain. But this was once more rejected by the British who did not consider integration as &quot;a practical proposition for Mauritius, even if the majority of parties in Mauritius wanted it&quot;.

Under the supervision of the Colonial Office Ramgoolam served as Chief Minister and Minister of Finance from 1961 to 1965, then as &quot;Premier&quot; from 1965 to 1968, before becoming Prime Minister in 1968. In 1963, the British Conservative government assisted him to form an All-Party Government in Mauritius. His efforts were recognised as he was honoured as knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 12 June 1965.

In 1967 he cooperated with the Independent Forward Bloc (IFB) led by Sookdeo Bissoondoyal (who were advocating complete decolonization and removal of British administration from all Mauritian territories) and the Comité d&#x27;Action Musulman (CAM) led by Abdool Razack Mohamed (which campaigned for constitutional guarantees to protect the Muslim and other minority communities in an effort to prevent a circumstantial Hindu hegemony) to form the Independence Party (Mauritius). This coalition eventually led to 1968 Independence from Great Britain after the 1967 Mauritian general election.

=== Independence ===
In 1969, he contracted an alliance with his party&#x27;s rival Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate (PMSD) which was led by Gaetan Duval. This alliance allowed Ramgoolam to stay in power despite the departure of its former ally IFB from the government. Sookdeo Bissoondoyal&#x27;s IFB members went into opposition whilst some IFB MP&#x27;s defected to the Labour Party to maintain their ministerial portfolios.

In 1973, France elevated Seewoosagur Ramgoolam to the rank of &quot;Grand Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur de la République Française&quot;. At the same time his political ally Gaetan Duval was made &quot;Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;.

Due to the poor performance of his various governments from 1967 to 1982, his party lost the 1982 general elections when none of his candidates was elected to parliament. He lost his parliamentary seat which led to further downfall of the Labour Party. He then assisted the newly formed party named MSM and its ex-MMM leader Anerood Jugnauth to win the 1983 elections. The Labour Party became a minority party in a coalition MSM-Labour government and Ramgoolam was appointed Governor-General, a position which he held until his death in 1985. Ramgoolam was succeeded as leader of the Labour Party by Sir Satcam Boolell in 1984 when the latter returned to the Labour Party after having formed and led a new party Mouvement Patriotique Mauricien (MPM) following his 1982 electoral defeat. Boolell remained president of the Labour Party until 1991.

Ramgoolam was also the Chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity from 1976 to 1977.

==Personal life==
In 1939, Ramgoolam married Sushil Ramjoorawon. They had two children: a daughter, Sunita (now Sunita Joypaul), and a son, Navin Ramgoolam who also served as prime minister.

==Legacy and recognition==

Various streets and public places in Mauritius bear the name of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (SSR), such as the SSR Botanical Garden, a recreational centre for senior citizens, SSR Medical College, Pamplemousses SSR National Hospital (at the site of the defunct Royal Alfred Observatory), the island&#x27;s main airport, previously called Plaisance International Airport, and Kewal Nagar (a small village previously called &quot;Belle Rive&quot;). He also figures on every Mauritian Rupee coin and on the highest note tender of Rs2,000. Monuments to him also stand in the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden, on Caudan Waterfront in Port Louis, and even in the village of SSR&#x27;s ancestor, near Patna, Bihar in India.

<doc id="718693" wikidata="Q608931" url="?curid=718693" title="Saxon XSLT">
<text>Saxon is an XSLT and XQuery processor created by Michael Kay and now developed and maintained by the company he founded, Saxonica. There are open-source and also closed-source commercial versions. Versions exist for Java, JavaScript and .NET.

The current version, as of September 2024, is 12.5.

== Versions ==
The original development line of Saxon ended with the version 6 series. This is a series of XSLT 1.0 processors. The current version, 6.5.5, is not undergoing further development aside from maintenance. The 6 series is only available for the Java programming language.

The current development line, Saxon 12, implements the XSLT 3.0 and XQuery 3.1 specifications. Saxon 12 can process XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 stylesheets. (XSLT 2.0 and 3.0 are highly backwards compatible with XSLT 1.0.) and also includes selective support for the proposed XSLT 4.0 specification.

There are two separate source bases: the Java source, and the JavaScript source. The Java source is used to generate products for three platforms: SaxonJ (for Java and other JVM languages such as Scala), SaxonCS (for C# and other .NET languages such as VB.NET), and SaxonC (with APIs for C, C++, Python, and PHP). The JavaScript source base is used to generate SaxonJS, which runs in Web browsers and under Node.js.

The Java-built versions come in three levels: Home Edition offers the minimal level of standards conformance defined in the specifications, as an open-source product. Professional Edition adds vendor-specific functionality not required by the standards, for example a range of extension functions and serialisation options. Enterprise Edition adds advanced features (defined in the W3C standards as optional) including schema-awareness and streaming, as well as performance-related features such as multi-threaded execution and bytecode generation.

The SaxonCS product is built from the Java source base by means of a custom Java-to-C# transpiler written in XSLT (see ). As of April 2022, only the Enterprise Edition is offered on this platform.

From 2004 until 2009, Saxon was available into two separate forms: Saxon-B and Saxon-SA. Both of these were built on similar codebases. Saxon-B was open-source software released under the Mozilla Public License, while Saxon-SA was a closed-source commercial product.

The difference between Saxon-B and Saxon-SA was that B was &quot;basic&quot; while SA was &quot;schema-aware&quot;. These terms are references to terms in the XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 specification. A processor that is &quot;schema-aware&quot; is able to use a W3C XML Schema to define the data types of the various elements in the source XML document(s). These data types can then be used in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 commands. A &quot;basic&quot; XSLT 2.0 processor is unable to use data typing information.

Saxon offers strict conformance to the XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0 and 3.0, and XQuery 1.0 and 3.0 W3C Recommendations, and also implements XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1. As of 2021 the current version (10.6) conforms with the W3C Recommendations for XSLT 3.0, XPath 3.1, and XQuery 3.1.

The Saxon source code is written in Java. During 2005-6, M. David Peterson and others demonstrated that Saxon could be cross-compiled to run on .NET using the IKVM.NET cross-compiler, launching Saxon.NET as a separate product independent of the original developer. With the release of Saxon 8.7, Saxonica adopted this technology and from that release onwards, all versions have been released simultaneously for Java and .NET. The .NET version of the product omits features that are specific to the Java platform (such as integration with JDOM, Dom4j, and XOM) and instead provides features that integrate with the XML processing capabilities of the .NET platform.

In 2012, following a series of prototypes, Saxonica released Saxon Client Edition (Saxon-CE), a version of the product adapted to run within the browser environment. This is achieved by adapting the Java source code so that it can be cross-compiled to JavaScript using the GWT cross-compiler produced by Google. Saxon-CE provides the first implementation of XSLT 2.0 running on the browser, and also extends the language so that rather than merely generating HTML, it can directly handle user interaction. With the release of Saxon-CE 1.1 in February 2013, the product became open source. In February 2016 Michael Kay announced that Saxonica was working on a replacement for Saxon-CE written in pure JavaScript, and dubbed Saxon-JS.

Michael Kay, the author of Saxon, was the editor of the XSLT 2.0 specification and is also editor of the XSLT 3.0 draft.

== Features ==

The Saxon versions that are available for the Java, C (including PHP and Python), and .NET platforms are built from a single codebase. The latter version is built using a transpiler. All technology platform versions share the same capabilities, and they are made available with three different feature sets under two different licensing conditions. For each of these technology platforms, there is an open-source product, Saxon-HE, that is licensed under MPL-2.0. It provides basic XSLT 3.0, XPath 3.1, and XQuery 3.1 functionality, as defined by the respective specifications. In addition, Saxon-HE implements certain features that the XSLT 3.0 specification declares as optional and that were previously reserved for the commercial versions, such as dynamic XPath 3.1 evaluation and higher-order functions in XSLT 3.0. The commercial versions are called Saxon-PE and Saxon-EE. A detailed and up-to-date feature matrix can be found on the Saxonica web site.

The fourth technology platform is JavaScript. Previously the open-source XSLT processor Saxon-CE was cross-compiled from the common Java source using GWT. SaxonJS is a completely new implementation in JavaScript. The XSLT sources can either be compiled using Saxon-EE or using a built-in XSLT-based XSLT compiler, which creates less optimized code. On the other hand, the XSLT-based XSLT compiler allows dynamic compilation and execution of XSLT. While SaxonJS supports most of the XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 features available in Saxon-HE, SaxonJS does not support XQuery. In contrast to Saxon-HE and the discontinued Saxon-CE, SaxonJS is not open source, but it can be used for free in the browser or in Node.js.

<text>Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo, GCMG, GCSK, QC, (born Vīracāmi Riṅkāṭu; 20 October 1920 – 9 September 2000) was a Mauritian politician, minister, the sixth and last governor-general of Mauritius from 1986 to 1992, and then the first president of Mauritius from March to June 1992.

== Early life ==
Born in 1920 in an Indian Tamil family, Ringadoo was educated at Port Louis Grammar School and completed his LLB at the London School of Economics in 1948. He was also the founder of the League of Tamils in 1937.

==Political career==
At the 1953 general elections he was elected for the first time to the Legislative Council in Moka-Flacq, representing Labour Party alongside Ackbar Gujadhur and Satcam Boolell. At the 1959 and 1963 elections he was elected to the Legislative Council at No. 17 Quartier Militaire after standing as candidate of Labour Party.

In 1967, he was elected to Legislative Council at Constituency No. 8 (Quartier Militaire-Moka) as candidate of the Independence Party coalition alongside Mahess Teeluck and Abdool Razack Mohamed.

In 1976, he was re-elected at No. 8, alongside Mahess Teeluck. He held the portfolio of finance minister of Mauritius during most of these terms. But at the 1982 general elections he was not elected following the landslide victory of MMM-PSM against PTr-PMSD.

He served as governor-general of Mauritius from 17 January 1986 to 12 March 1992, when it became a republic. Ringadoo then served as interim president until later in 1992, when he was replaced by the second president, Cassam Uteem.

==Recognition==
Ringadoo was knighted in the 1975 New Year Honours, and following his appointment as Governor-General, appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in June 1986.

<doc id="718698" wikidata="Q2940838" url="?curid=718698" title="Cascade Mountain (Alberta)">
<text>Cascade Mountain is a mountain located in the Bow River Valley of Banff National Park, adjacent to the town of Banff. The mountain was named in 1858 by James Hector after the waterfall or cascade on the southern flanks of the peak. The mountain has also been called Stoney Chief, which is related to the name of the smaller neighbouring mountain Stoney Squaw, which is still in use. Cascade is the highest mountain adjacent to the townsite.

== Climbing routes ==
The mountain can be climbed starting from the Norquay Ski Area base. The first portion is a fairly moderate hike, up to the Cascade Amphitheatre. Continuing upwards, the route ascends along the ridge edge until it reaches the crest where it dips before it rises to the false summit. While the false summit can be descended at its end, it is much easier to follow a trail around the western side along the exposed foot. Snow typically blocks this route almost until mid July and attempting it while snowy can entail considerable avalanche risk due to the slabby terrain and exposure. A long window of clear weather - full day - should be anticipated before attempting this climb, as many climbers have gotten into trouble and needed rescue (or died) when a storm suddenly blows in. The ascent normally takes 3 to 6 hours, while the descent along the same path takes 2 to 4 hours.

Looking at Cascade Mountain from Banff avenue, the ridge on the right (above the old Buffalo paddock) is the SW ridge. It was first climbed in 1977 by the late Jean Pierre Cadot and René Boisselle. In early 1900, MacCarthy (first ascent of Mt Logan in Yukon) mentioned that Cascade Mt seems to offer good rock on the SW ridge. The route starts between the two obvious buttress and gains the crest of the ridge after a few rope pitches. The upper and very steep buttress is climbed via a chimney on the left side. The entire route is 5.6 or 5.7 grade III.

<text>Yacht people is a slang term for the wealthy residents of Hong Kong who fled the city in the 1980s and 1990s, prior to the city&#x27;s return to Chinese rule in 1997.

<text>Delonix is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae. It contains trees that are native to Madagascar and East Africa. By far the best known species is the Royal Poinciana (&quot;D. regia&quot;).

The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words δηλος (&quot;delos&quot;), meaning &quot;evident,&quot; and ονυξ (&quot;onyx&quot;), meaning &quot;claw,&quot; referring to the petals. The common name, poinciana, comes from a former genus of the same name in which the members of the current genus &quot;Delonix&quot; were classified along with plants now placed in the genus &quot;Caesalpinia&quot;.

==Species==
12 species are accepted:
==Use==
These plants (collectively known as or ) release brown resin lumps that can be dissolved to make glue, or sucked as edible sweets among the Malagasy. Their seeds too are roasted and eaten as a snack in the south.

<text>Tagesthemen () is one of Germany&#x27;s main daily television news magazines, presented by journalists Helge Fuhst, Aline Abboud, Ingo Zamperoni and . Second only to the 20:00 &quot;Tagesschau&quot; (&quot;Review of the Day&quot;) &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; (&quot;Issues of the Day&quot;) is ARD&#x27;s most important newscast. It is different in style and content from &quot;Tagesschau&quot; and is broadcast Mondays to Thursdays at 22:15, Fridays at 23:15, Saturdays at varying times and Sundays at 22:45. On special news occasions, a &quot;Tagesthemen extra&quot; is also broadcast before the main show. Each &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; broadcast has a single host, a single newsreader for the news block, usually from the earlier &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, a weather presenter broadcasting from Frankfurt, and a presenter for the sports block on the weekends. Previously recorded &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; newscasts can also be seen internationally via YouTube on Tagesschau&#x27;s YouTube Channel.

==History==
In January 1978, &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; replaced the late edition of &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, which had been broadcast until then. The broadcast lasts a half hour on weekdays; it is shorter on Fridays (15 minutes) Saturdays (20 minutes) and Sundays (15 minutes).

In contrast to &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, which provides only an overview of the news, &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; is designed to also provide the viewer with more information, context and background. The program usually features four to five segments on the stories and themes of the day.

Previously, the program used a variation of the Tagesschau theme, &quot;Hammond Fantasy&quot;, with the first and last notes in the same keys. From 1997 to 2014, Tagesthemen used the same music as Tagesschau. Currently Tagesthemen uses a different variation of the Hammond Fantasy, similar to the original Tagesthemen theme.

&quot;Tagesschau&quot; editorial staff provide a daily news summary to the program. A weather report was part of the news summary until 2002: since then it has been presented by a meteorologist, in cooperation with Meteomedia AG, a privately owned company. Since 2020, the weather report is presented from the ARD weather center at the studios of Hessischer Rundfunk in Frankfurt.

&quot;Tagesthemen&quot;&#x27;s market share sank with the opening of media competition in Germany; nevertheless, it still lies today at about 12% — this amounts to about 2.5 million viewers per broadcast. &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; is one of the most influential opinion builders in Germany.

==Presenters==
Since 1 October 1985 &quot;Tagesthemen&quot;, like &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, has been presented by various hosts. Since the start, the hosts alternate weekly.

The hosts write their scripts themselves; the presentation generally has a much looser style than &quot;Tagesschau&quot;. Since the &quot;Tagesthemen&quot; hosts are not restricted to simply reading the daily dispatches, they can develop a lively, personal style compared to their colleagues at &quot;Tagesschau&quot;, although they are still required to be neutral and objective.

<doc id="718710" wikidata="Q18690380" url="?curid=718710" title="Oegopsida">
<text>Oegopsida is one of the two orders of squid in the superorder Decapodiformes, in the class Cephalopoda. Together with the Myopsina, it was formerly considered to be a suborder of the order Teuthida, in which case it was known as Oegopsina. This reclassification is due to Oegopsina and Myopsina not being demonstrated to form a clade.

The Oegopsida are an often pelagic squid, with some nerito-oceanic species associated with sea mounts. They consist of 24 families and 69 genera. They have these characters in common: the head is without tentacle pockets, eyes lack a corneal covering, arms and tentacle clubs may have hooks, the buccal supports are without suckers, and oviducts in females are paired.

Two families, the Bathyteuthidae and Chtenopterygidae, which have features characteristic of the Myopsida while retaining others common to the Oegopsina, were formerly placed in the family, but are now placed in their own order Bathyteuthida.

The Oegopsida differ from the coastal Myopsida, characterised by the genus &quot;Loligo&quot;, which have corneal coverings over the eyes and tentacle pockets, but lack hooks, have no suckers on the buccal supports, and a single oviduct.

Oegopsid squid are the only decapods that lack a pocket for the tentacles. Otherwise, they share different characters with different decapod groups. Like the Bathyteuthida and Myopsida, the Oegopsida have a brachial canal, which is absent in other forms. As with the Spirulidae and Idiosepiidae, the Oegopsida lack suckers on the buccal supports, and like the Bathyteuthida, Idiosepiidae, and Spirulidae, they have no circular muscle on the suckers.

== Evolution ==
The earliest fossils of Oegopsida are jaw fragments from the Santonian or early Campanian of the Yezo Group in Hokkaido, Japan. These jaw fragments are extremely large, suggesting that oegopsids could already evolve very large body sizes early on. One of these fossils was described as the genus &quot;Yezoteuthis&quot;, which has been estimated to rival the modern giant squid in size. Another jaw fragment described in 2023 was found to be twice as long as a giant squid&#x27;s jaws.

<text>Dreux () is a commune in the Eure-et-Loir department in northern France.

==Geography==
Dreux lies on the small river Blaise, a tributary of the Eure, about 35 km north of Chartres. Dreux station has rail connections to Argentan, Paris and Granville. The Route nationale 12 (Paris–Rennes) passes north of the town.

==History==
Dreux was known in ancient times as Durocassium, the capital of the Durocasses Celtic tribe. Despite the legend, its name was not related with Druids. The Romans established here a fortified camp known as Castrum Drocas.

In the Middle Ages, Dreux was the centre of the County of Dreux. The first count of Dreux was Robert, the son of King Louis the Fat. The first large battle of the French Wars of Religion occurred at Dreux, on 19 December 1562, resulting in a hard-fought victory for the Catholic forces of the duc de Montmorency.

In October 1983, the Front National won 55% of the vote in the second round of elections for the city council of Dreux, in one of its first significant electoral victories.

==Population==


Dreux has a significant Muslim population, and is estimated to be around 35%. Dreux&#x27;s Muslim population consists mainly of North Africans, Arabs, Turks, and Sub-Saharan Africans. Many Muslims in Dreux experience high levels of poverty and unemployment. One-in-four residents in the town are immigrants.

==Sights==

===Chapelle royale de Dreux===

In 1775, the lands of the &quot;comté de Dreux&quot; had been given to the Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre by his cousin Louis XVI. In 1783, the duke sold his domain of Rambouillet to Louis XVI. On 25 November of that year, in a long religious procession, Penthièvre transferred the nine caskets containing the remains of his parents, the Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse and Marie Victoire de Noailles, comtesse de Toulouse, his wife, Marie Thérèse Félicité d&#x27;Este, Princess of Modène, and six of their seven children, from the small medieval village church next to the castle in Rambouillet, to the chapel of the Collégiale Saint-Étienne de Dreux. The duc de Penthièvre died in March 1793 and his body was laid to rest in the crypt beside his parents. On 21 November of that same year, in the midst of the French Revolution, a mob desecrated the crypt and threw the ten bodies in a mass grave in the &quot;Chanoines&quot; cemetery of the Collégiale Saint-Étienne. In 1816, the duc de Penthièvre&#x27;s daughter, Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, duchesse d&#x27;Orléans, had a new chapel built on the site of the mass grave of the Chanoines cemetery, as the final resting place for her family. In 1830, Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, son of the duchesse d&#x27;Orléans, embellished the chapel which was renamed Chapelle royale de Dreux, now the necropolis of the Orléans royal family.

<text>A whipping boy was a boy educated alongside a prince (or boy monarch) in early modern Europe, who supposedly received corporal punishment for the prince&#x27;s transgressions in his presence. The prince was not punished himself because his royal status exceeded that of his tutor; seeing a friend punished would provide an equivalent motivation not to repeat the offence. An archaic proverb which captures a similar idea is &quot;to beat a dog before a lion&quot;. Whipping was a common punishment administered by tutors at that time. There is little contemporary evidence for the existence of whipping boys, and evidence that some princes were indeed whipped by their tutors, although Nicholas Orme suggests that nobles might have been beaten less often than other pupils. Some historians regard whipping boys as entirely mythical; others suggest they applied only in the case of a boy king, protected by divine right, and not to mere princes.

In Renaissance humanism, Erasmus&#x27; treatises &quot;The Education of a Christian Prince&quot; (1516) and &quot;Declamatio de pueris statim ac liberaliter instituendis&quot; (1530) mention the inappropriateness of physical chastisement of princes, but do not mention proxy punishment. Hartley Coleridge wrote in 1852, &quot;to be flogged by proxy was the exclusive privilege of royal blood. ... It was much coveted for the children of the poorer gentry, as the first step in the ladder of preferment.&quot; John Gough Nichols wrote in 1857, &quot;the whole matter is somewhat legendary, and though certain vicarious or rather minatory punishments may have been occasionally adopted, it does not seem likely that any one individual among the King&#x27;s schoolfellows should have been uniformly selected, whether he were in fault or not, as the victim or scape-goat of the royal misdemeanours&quot;.

In current English, a &quot;whipping boy&quot; is a metaphor which may have a similar meaning to scapegoat, fall guy, or sacrificial lamb; alternatively it may mean a perennial loser, a victim of group bullying or someone who is unfairly blamed for the actions of others.

==Putative historical examples==
Young royals alleged to have had whipping boys include:
* Conrad, King of Jerusalem and later of Italy (1228–1254) had twelve companions beaten in his stead by his tutors, according to the &quot;Cento Novelle Antiche&quot; (c.1300), so that &quot;King Conrad took great heed not to act wrongly, for pity of them&quot;. Alessandro d&#x27;Ancona sees an antecedent of the Conrad &quot;novella&quot; in Phaedrus&#x27; fable &quot;The Bullock and the Old Ox&quot;.
* Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset (1519–1536), whose tutor Richard Croke complained in 1527 that Richmond&#x27;s usher, George Cotton, was undermining Croke&#x27;s authority; among the charges were withdrawing &quot;those boys whose punishment it was necessary to deter his princely pupil from the repetition of his faults&quot;, and claiming it was unseemly for Croke to whip them in Richmond&#x27;s presence.
* Edward VI of England (1537–1553) to whose court Barnaby Fitzpatrick, later 2nd Baron Upper Ossory (c.1535–1581) was sent as a hostage by his father the 1st baron. Thomas Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Church-History of Britain&quot; (1655) calls Fitzpatrick Edward&#x27;s &quot;proxy for correction&quot;. John Guy calls this a myth, since their tutor Richard Cox wrote of beating Edward with his staff. Konrad Heresbach in &quot;De Educandis Erudiendisque Principum Liberis&quot; (1592) recounted that he was told in London in 1547 that, when the young king uttered profanities learnt from an (unnamed) playmate, the friend was whipped in his presence and Edward warned that he deserved similar punishment. 
* The future Frederick IV of Liegnitz (1552–1596), for whom (1552–1616) was described in 1856 as the by Gustav Freytag, popularising the concept in Germany. Freytag&#x27;s claim is not supported by other accounts of Schweinichen.
* The future Charles I of England (1600–1649), to whom William Murray, later 1st Earl of Dysart (c.1600–1655) was &quot;page and whipping–boy&quot; according to Gilbert Burnet&#x27;s &quot;History of my own time&quot; (1723). William&#x27;s uncle Thomas Murray tutored both boys. As king, Charles appointed William Groom of the Bedchamber.
* The young Louis XV of France (1710–1774) was supplied by his governess Madame de Ventadour with playmates of his own age, including a Versailles cobbler&#x27;s son nicknamed (&quot;the hussar&quot;) from a costume he wore. Marie, marquise du Deffand wrote in 1769 that this boy would be punished in the king&#x27;s stead, whence the victim of any bully was colloquially called their &quot;hussard&quot;. in 1825 called the method &quot;strange&quot;, &quot;rather barbarous&quot;, and &quot;iniquitous&quot;, and said Louis continued to neglect his studies regardless.
* According to the 1898 memoirs of François Certain de Canrobert, who served in the French Army in 1842 in Algeria under the Spanish-born Antoine de La Torré (1787–1851), it was rumoured that de La Torré was an illegitimate son of Manuel Godoy and that his irascibility was because as a boy he had received &quot;either slaps or the whip&quot; as proxy for the sons of Charles IV.
*Chinese imperial princes of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) had banner attendants denoted by the Manchu term (Chinese transcription ); at first this meant youths educated alongside the prince, and later his special &quot;reading partner&quot; and bodyguard. These were influential in the Kangxi reign (1661–1722) but subsequently lost status. In 1876, the &quot;North-China Herald&quot; commented on the announcement in the &quot;Peking Gazette&quot; of the start of the education of the five-year-old Guangxu Emperor: &quot;The next appointment to be made (though not gazetted) will probably be that of the child who, according to the Manchu Imperial custom, shares his Majesty&#x27;s studies under the name of &#x27;, in the capacity of a or &quot;whipping-boy.&quot; Whenever the Son of Heaven is naughty or inattentive, the &#x27; is beaten or disgraced&quot;.

An adult example often included in discussions of whipping boys is provided by the French Catholic prelates Arnaud d&#x27;Ossat (1537–1604) and Jacques Davy Duperron (1556–1618), who were symbolically whipped by Pope Clement VIII in 1593 in proxy expiation on behalf of Henry IV of France (1553–1610), who had renounced Protestantism.

==In later literature==
Samuel Rowley&#x27;s 1604 play &quot;When You See Me You Know Me&quot; depicts the childhood of the future Edward VI. When he skips class to play tennis, Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Browne is sent to the chapel to be whipped by the master of children. Cranmer says, &quot;Since he was whipped thus for the prince&#x27;s faults. / His grace hath got more knowledge in a month. / Than he attained in a year before, / For still the fearful boy, to save his breech, / Doth hourly haunt him, wheresoe&#x27;er he goes.&quot; The prince persuades king Henry VIII to knight Ned: &quot;the poor gentleman was pitifully wounded in the back parts, as may appear by the scar, if his knightship would but untruss there&quot;. Ned hopes the tutors will refrain from whipping a knight, to which the fool retorts, &quot;If they do, he shall make thee a lord, and then they dare not.&quot; This work may have helped the idea of a whipping boy to take root.

John Donne alluded to proxy whipping in a sermon he preached in 1628: &quot;Sometimes, when the children of great persons offend at school, another person is whipped for them, and that affects them, and works upon a good nature; but if that person should take physic for them in a sickness, it would do them no good: God&#x27;s corrections upon others may work by way of example upon thee; but because thou art sick for physic, take it thyself.&quot; The earliest attestation of the word &quot;whipping boy&quot; in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from a 1647 Bible commentary by John Trapp on : &quot;Those Presbyters that sin publikely ... and those who were convicted by two or three witnesses ...: Rebuke before all, yet not as if they were whipping boyes&quot;.

In Book V of &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (1715) by Alain-René Lesage, when the Marquis of Leganez forbids his son&#x27;s tutors from beating him, Don Raphael is flogged in his stead: &quot;a most ingenious device, by which to keep this troublesome young lordling in awe, without trenching on his foolish father&#x27;s injunctions&quot;. &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; (1822) by Walter Scott describes Malagrowther, the fictional whipping boy of the young James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England): &quot;Under the stern rule, indeed, of George Buchanan, who did not approve of the vicarious mode of punishment, James bore the penance of his own faults, and Mungo Malagrowther enjoyed a sinecure; but James&#x27;s other pedagogue, Master Patrick Young, went more ceremoniously to work, and appalled the very soul of the youthful King by the floggings which he bestowed on the whipping-boy, when the royal task was not suitably performed.&quot; In Mark Twain&#x27;s 1881 novel, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, the pauper&#x27;s masquerade as Edward VI is aided by information from the prince&#x27;s whipping boy, son and namesake of the late Sir Humphrey Marlow, a &quot;Head Lieutenant&quot; in Henry VIII&#x27;s Household. Twain wrote, &quot;James I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little fellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their lessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my own purposes.&quot;

&quot;The Whipping Boy&quot; by Sid Fleischman, which won the 1987 Newbery Medal for children&#x27;s books, tells of the brattish Prince Horace who learns humility on an adventure with his whipping boy, a rat-catcher named Jemmy. In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, published from 1991, the characters Tommen Baratheon and Joffrey Baratheon have a whipping boy named Pate. In David Belbin&#x27;s 2002 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Boy King&quot;, Barnaby FitzPatrick is whipped by John Cheke for teaching Edward VI swear-words; when Edward protests that nobody has whipping boys any more, Cheke says &quot;the Duke of Richmond had one&quot;. Cheke relents from giving FitzPatrick the whipping owed to Edward. Sarah Ruhl&#x27;s 2016 play &quot;Scenes from Court Life, or The Whipping Boy and His Prince&quot; includes whipping boys in its depictions of Charles I and Charles II of England.

==Modern slavery==
Some accounts of modern slavery include instances of slaves punished for the offences of a master&#x27;s child. In 19th-century southern China, among slave boys as study companions to candidates for the imperial examinations, one example was noted by James L. Watson. In Alex Tizon&#x27;s 2017 nonfiction essay &quot;My Family&#x27;s Slave&quot;, the author&#x27;s mother recounts a 1940s incident in which, caught in a lie, she made Lola, the titular servant, receive the punishment of 12 lashes of her father&#x27;s belt. Biram Dah Abeid has alleged that slaves in Mauritania are used as or whipping boys.

<text>Schenley Park () is a large municipal park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located between the neighborhoods of Oakland, Greenfield, and Squirrel Hill. It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. In 2011, the park was named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Coolest City Parks&quot; by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;.

The park is made up of donated by Mary Schenley in 1889 and another that the city subsequently purchased from her. Another were acquired at a later date, bringing the park&#x27;s total size to , and making it the second largest municipal park in Pittsburgh, behind Frick Park.

The park borders the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, and technically Carnegie Mellon University is actually within Schenley Park.

==Facilities==
Schenley Park features a grand entrance, Schenley Plaza, and several miles of hiking trails and a large pond in Panther Hollow. Across from the Phipps Conservatory is Flagstaff Hill, a popular place to watch outdoor movies in the summer.

In the early days of Schenley Park, the area known as &quot;The Oval&quot; was used for horse racing. Today, it has 13 tennis courts, an all weather running track, and a soccer field. There is also an ice skating rink, public swimming pool, and an 18-hole disc golf course nearby.

Schenley Park also contains the Bob O&#x27;Connor Golf Course. The golf course includes an indoor practice facility where golfers can play a &quot;virtual&quot; round on Pebble Beach and other famous courses.

Cross country running meets are held in the park. It is the home course for the Carnegie Mellon University men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country teams. The 1921 USA Cross Country Championships were held in the park.

==Annual events==
Since 1983, Schenley Park has been home to a vintage motor sports car race, the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, that takes place annually in mid-July. Additionally, since 1993, the park has been home to the Komen Pittsburgh Race for the Cure, an annual fundraising event for breast cancer and Mother&#x27;s Day tradition with more than 35,000 participants. Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s annual Spring Carnival contests its Sweepstakes, a buggy race, on Tech Avenue, Schenley Drive, and Frew Street.

==History==

In 1842, Mary Elizabeth Croghan of Pittsburgh, who was 15 at the time, eloped with 43-year-old Captain Edward Schenley. The couple moved to England. Mary&#x27;s father attempted to terminate her inheritance in a lawsuit, but was unsuccessful. Mary&#x27;s maternal grandfather, General James O&#x27;Hara, bequeathed to her a parcel of land known as the &quot;Mt. Airy Tract.&quot;

Mary&#x27;s wealth attracted the attention of several land developers in the Pittsburgh area as well as Edward Bigelow, the Director of the Department of Public Works in Pittsburgh. In 1889, Bigelow learned that the agent of a land developer planned to travel to London to attempt to purchase the land from Mary. Bigelow sent an East Liberty lawyer by train to New York City where he then boarded a steamer bound for England. The lawyer beat the real estate agent by two days.

After negotiations with Mary, Bigelow&#x27;s lawyer entered into an agreement to give of the Mt. Airy Tract to the city of Pittsburgh with an option to purchase more, under the conditions that the park be named after her and never be sold. The city agreed and immediately purchased the additional land.

Bigelow began to develop the newly renamed Schenley Park for recreational uses. He hired William Falconer to lead the Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens which was built in 1893. In 1895, Andrew Carnegie built the Carnegie Museum and Music Hall, establishing Oakland and Schenley Park as a cultural icon.

Forbes Field, the home field of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was adjacent to Schenley Park during its lifespan (1909–1970).

===Recent developments===
*In 2001, after extensive renovations, the Schenley Park Visitor Center opened in one of the park&#x27;s original buildings. The building had previously served as a tool shed, the home of the Pittsburgh Civic Garden Center, and a nature museum, until closing in the late 1980s.
*In spring 2006, the Schenley Plaza area was converted to its original use as a grand entrance to Schenley Park. Although it was originally designed as a grand entrance, it had been used as a parking lot for many years. The new park area features a carousel and several small food stands.
*In 2022, Judge John McVay approved the removal of the Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park. The bronze and granite statue is 13-feet tall, and has stood in the park since 1958. City of Pittsburgh officials decided to remove the statue in 2020 due to Columbus’ association with racism and colonialism. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America challenged this decision, but McVay’s 2022 ruling stated that the city was free to take down the statue.

The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR; &#x27;, ), commonly known asNorth YemenorYemen(Sanaʽa&quot;&#x27;), was a country that existed from 1962 to 1990 in the northwestern part of what is now Yemen. Its capital was at Sanaa. It united with the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (commonly known as South Yemen) on 22 May 1990 to form the current Republic of Yemen.

== History ==
=== Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ===

Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 after the First World War, northern Yemen became an independent state as the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. 

The first king of the independent country was Yahya Muhammad Hamid ad-Din. Having declared Yemen&#x27;s independence from the Ottomans, he proclaimed himself king and And achieved international recognition for the kingdom in 1926. Hamid ad-Din created the kingdom&#x27;s first regular army. He fought a war with Saudi Arabia and did not recognize his border with the British protectorate of Aden, leading to periodic clashes with British troops. But he focused primarily on consolidating his power and creating a viable central government and appointed his sons to rule various provinces of the kingdom. After almost 30 years of rule (30 October 1918 – 17 February 1948 as a king), he was assassinated in what became known as the Al-Waziri coup. He was succeeded by his son, Ahmad bin Yahya. Like his father, Ahmad was an conservative. Ahmad&#x27;s ruthless, arbitrary, and inconsistent rule made him the target of coup attempts and frequent assassination attempts, which he narrowly escaped. His enemies ranged from ambitious family members to forward-looking pan-Arabists and Republicans. His abrupt temperament and unpredictable behaviour united and set against him a variety of enemies. The monarchy deliberately exploited the kingdom&#x27;s highly fragmented tribal society and exploited frequent tribal wars for remaining in power. In foreign policy, his only constant goal was to expel Britain from Aden in order to annex it to his kingdom. But he was not destined to realize his ambitions: he died suddenly in his sleep on September 19, 1962.

Throughout the existence of the absolute monarchy, Yemen was a very underdeveloped state. The complete conservatism of the kings and the unwillingness of the absolute monarchy to modernize in general brought with them the unfortunate but quite logical consequences of an underdeveloped economy and almost complete absence of roads or motor transport. The kingdom was predominantly an agricultural country. The rule of Hamid ed-Din (Although Hamid ad-Din took some steps towards creating a modern state, they were not enough) and especially Ahmad was always autocratic and conservative; Ahmad never brooked suggestions. Yemen remained a semi-feudal state, where is every detail, no matter how insignificant or trivial, had to be approved by the imam, even for a government truck to move in Taiz or for mules to get fodder.

=== The overthrow of the monarchy and the beginning of a civil war ===

The Yemeni kingdom&#x27;s lack of modernity and development led to revolutionary and anti-monarchist ideas in various layers of society. The army also fell victim to dissent. It had many anti-monarchist soldiers and officers with Republican and Nasserist views. In 1962, at least four plots against the king were planned in Yemen, two of which were prepared by military commanders. In December 1961, the Organization of Free Officers (similar to the Nasserist &quot;Free Officers Movement&quot; in Egypt) was created in the Yemeni Kingdom, the purpose of which was to coordinate an anti-monarchist coup. 
But King Ahmad died suddenly, throwing the plotters into disarray. His son Muhammad al-Badr was crowned in his place on September 19. Badr promised to modernize Yemen so that it could “catch up with the caravan of world progress.” We will probably never know whether he had any intention of implementing the promised reforms in the long term, because the military revolutionaries quickly switched its plot from the king to his son. Just a week after Badr&#x27;s coronation, a coup took place in Sana&#x27;a on September 26: Nasserist officers overthrew the monarchy, seized power, and King Badr and his accomplices fled. The new government declared Yemen a republic, abolished slavery, a curfew was imposed and the Yemeni military police was formed. The coup in the north almost coincided (and inspired) with the beginning of the uprising and emergency in the south (in Aden). The first country to recognize the republic was the USSR. Two days after the coup, Abdullah al-Sallal, one of the main organizers of the coup and the first president of the newborn republic, said: &quot;The corrupt monarchy which ruled for a thousand years was a disgrace to the Arab nation and to all humanity. Anyone who tries to restore it is an enemy of God and man!&quot;.

But Badr not only survived, but was also able to unite a lot of the tribes that supported him in the opposition to Sallal. He received support from other monarchies (such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan), who were afraid of Sallal&#x27;s revolutionary nasserist regime and feared that the coup would spread to their monarchy too (Al-Sallal opened the Arabian Peninsula Office in 1963 and openly called for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and the creation of a unified socialist Arabia). At the same time, Egypt began to support the Sallal&#x27;s government, supplying them weapons, military advisers and even sending Egyptian forces to fight against royalists later. As a result – this coup d&#x27;état marked the beginning of the North Yemen Civil War that pitted republican troops, assisted by the United Arab Republic (Egypt), against Badr&#x27;s royalist forces, supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan. 

The war was very expensive for Egypt. In 1967, most of the Egyptian troops were withdrawn from North Yemen to join the conflict of the Six-day War. In November 1967, the royalists laid siege to the capital Sana&#x27;a, but the Republican resistance was not suppressed and, in February 1968, the siege was lifted. Despite the fact that territorially, most of Yemen remained under the control of al-Badr, most of the big cities remained in the hands of the Republicans and their Egyptian allies. In 1970 Saudi Arabia, the main ally of king Badr, which was a fundamental enemy of the republican regime, suddenly recognized the Yemen Arab Republic, and other countries, such as the United Kingdom, quickly followed its example. For Badr, this was a complete surprise and humiliation, because no one consulted with him, and in fact, at this moment, after 8 years, the Republicans de-facto won a cruel war, which officially ended in December 1, and received recognition of their republic. The civil war further weakened the economy of the newborn republic.
=== Republic after war, 1970s ===
Although the war was over, its consequences remained. The country&#x27;s already small infrastructure was badly damaged by fighting, bombing and shelling, the weak economy collapsed, and people became even poorer. The first decade after the war was marked by political instability (as a several coups of dissident officers).

Rebuilding North Yemen’s infrastructure after the civil war proved extremely problematic. Apart from the devastated economy, there were other problems: the military took up to 50 percent of the national budget, amounting to only about £9 million in total, which was hopelessly inadequate in the circumstances. The army was the main social lift, but it (like the government) was riddled with graft and corruption. Controlled by the government, the military&#x27;s logistics system not only depended on Sana&#x27;a&#x27;s trust in the loyalty of local commanders, but was also susceptible to bribery and corruption. Although various leaders of the Yemen Arab Republic attempted to modernize the state, increase literacy, combat corruption, and rebuild and expand small infrastructure, this did not have the expected impact on the development of the country, which by 1990 remained very underdeveloped, poor, and mired in corruption, largely due to political instability and widespread nepotism.

Back in the 1960s, the Republican government formed the “Ministry of Tribal Affairs” or MTA (arabic: وزارة شؤون القبائل) to deal with tribal issues and resolve tribe conflicts, which spread under the monarchy. The first president of the Yemen Arab Republic, Abdullah al-Sallal, was overthrown even before the civil war ended, in 1967, and was succeeded by Abdul Rahman al-Eryani, the first and last civilian leader in northern Yemen. He opposed the Yemeni monarchy, but made moves to reconcile with royalists at the end of the civil war. In 1970, he reached a national peace accord with many supporters of the royal regime and established formal relations with Saudi Arabia, persuading it to recognize new republic. Under his rule, a unification agreement with southern Yemen was reached in 1972 (which formed the basis for unification in 1990), a permanent constitution was adopted, and the first parliamentary elections were held. But Eryani was overthrown in In what became known as the &quot;June 13 Corrective Movement&quot; in 1974 by Military Command Council (MCC) of 7 officers (de-facto Nasserist military junta) and replaced by Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi, leader of MCC. Hamdi tried to actively implement reforms within the republic and fought corruption, creating a number of committees to implement them. He tried to unite the tribal country and eliminate inter-tribal conflicts that were active under the monarchy and during the civil war (but at the same time he disbanded MTA, considering it &quot;an obstacle to economic and social development&quot;), reorganized the army, initiated a grand infrastructure plan and sought to educate the population (he allocated 31% of the country&#x27;s annual budget to education). But also under Hamdi, the role of the army in the political system and public life expanded: the army&#x27;s intervention in political life returned, and military rule became a feature of the political system. Hamdi also took steps towards rapprochement with the socialist regime in South Yemen and steps towards unity. In February 1977, the &quot;Kataba Agreement&quot; was concluded, which provided for the formation of a Yemeni council of presidents Ibrahim al-Hamdi and Salem Rabi Ali (South Yemeni president) to discuss and resolve all border issues that concern the united Yemeni people and to coordinate efforts in all areas, including foreign policy. In 1977, Hamdi was assassinated, presumably by a Saudi agent (although there is still no exact information). Power was seized by another officer: Ahmad al-Ghashmi (He was also suspected of involvement in Hamdi&#x27;s assassination). Gashmi was a conservative, unlike his predecessor, and advocated rolling back his Hamdi reforms. He also was known for his closeness to Saudi Arabia (he once called for unity with Saudi Arabia) and opposed Hamdi&#x27;s attempts to reduce Saudi influence in Yemen. Not much is known about Ghashmi&#x27;s presidency. However, he did not hold on to power for long: 8 months after coming to power, he was also assassinated in June 24, 1978.

=== Ali Abdullah Saleh&#x27;s takeover ===

Following the assassination of al-Ghashmi on 24 June 1978, Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh was appointed a member of the four-member interim presidential council and deputy commander of the General Staff. On 17 July 1978, Saleh was elected by parliament as President of the Yemen Arab Republic, simultaneously serving as Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, in theory controlling all power in the country. But in reality his power was unstable. Few people inside or outside the North Yemen expected him to survive for long, and most expected him to suffer the same fate as his two predecessors. In 1978–1979, several military coups and assassination attempts followed, and a coalition of North Yemeni opposition groups, the National Democratic Front (NDF), launched a initially successful years-long rebellion against the central government, with support from Libya and South Yemen. But to the surprise of outside observers, Saleh outlived them all. He managed to defeat his opponents, and after 4 years of rebellion, he was able to suppress the NDF forces in 1982 with the support of the United States and Taiwan. He successfully consolidated his personal power, transforming the government of the Yemen Arab Republic from a military junta to an authoritarian military dictatorship. He ultimately reversed the reformist program begun by al-Hamdi, opening the way to the corruption that had kept him in power. Saleh carried out major purges of military commanders to eliminate dissent and prevent further coups, and while these purges had a corresponding impact on the army&#x27;s performance in the second war with southern Yemen, they allowed Saleh to remain in power. His bodyguards numbered hundreds of men, mostly from his own Sanhan tribe.

Saleh describing as being neither from a &quot;sheikhly family&quot; nor a &quot;large or important tribe&quot; either, but instead rising to power through &quot;his own means&quot;, and creating a patronage system with his family at the top. His seven brothers were placed &quot;in key positions&quot;, and later he relied on &quot;sons, daughters, sons-in-law and nephews&quot;. Beneath the positions occupied by his extended family, Saleh &quot;relied heavily on the loyalty&quot; of two tribes, his own Sanhan tribe and the Hamdan San&#x27;a tribe of his mentor, the former president al-Ghashmi. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Middle Eastern correspondent Robert F. Worth described Saleh as reaching an understanding with powerful feudal &quot;big sheikhs&quot; to become &quot;part of a Mafia-style spoils system that substituted for governance&quot;. Robert Worth accused Saleh of exceeding the aggrandisement of other Middle Eastern strongmen by managing to &quot;rake off tens of billions of dollars in public funds for himself and his family&quot; despite the extreme poverty of his country. Saleh&#x27;s estimated current wealth of $62 billion made him the 5th richest person in the world in the 21st century. Saleh managed to reconcile most factions (though he, like the monarchy before him, exploited tribal conflicts and played off those who threatened his power), improved relations with Yemen&#x27;s neighbors, and relaunched various programs of economic and political development and institutionalization. He led Yemen into the oil age. However, citizens felt little benefit from his development programs, since it was mainly the top ranks of the government and the army (including Saleh himself) who got rich. 

As in the south, Saleh had three titles that were invariably repeated after his first and last name were pronounced: the brother president of the republic, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and secretary of the General People’s Congress.

By the mid-1980s, the North Yemeni state, however weak it was, was much stronger than it had been in the 1970s. Saleh was unable to build a strong economy and equality of all citizens, but he was able to bring stability to the YAR. The Saleh regime was able to establish a strong central government, and strengthen and expand the army and security forces: in 1982, the YAR spent 1,810 million Yemeni rials on the army, which was about three times more than it spent on medicine and education combined (580 million rials that same year), in 1985, the North Yemeni army was able to achieve military parity with the South. At the same time, the majority of the North Yemeni population was illiterate and poor.

=== Disputes with South Yemen ===

Unlike the early decades of other partitioned states such as East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, or North Vietnam and South Vietnam, all of which faced very tense relations or sometimes total wars, the relations between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) remained relatively friendly throughout most of their existence, although conflicts did arise. Fighting broke out in 1972, and the short-lived conflict was resolved with negotiations, where it was declared unification would eventually occur.

However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, as the PDRY funded Communist rebels in the YAR, and the war was only stopped by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.

Successor of Abdul Fattah Ismail, Ali Nasir Muhammad, became the general secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party in 1980 and took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman. A Yemeni council, made up of the two presidents and elected ministers, met twice a year. A draft constitution of 136 articles was prepared, but the council&#x27;s meetings did not immediately produce any concrete decisions.

=== Unification ===
Against the background of the perestroika in the Soviet Union, political reforms were started in PDRY in the late 1980s too. Political prisoners were released, political parties were formed, and the system of justice was reckoned to be more equitable than in the North. The weakening of the USSR, the main backer of the PDRY, and the reduction of its economic aid pushed South Yemen into new negotiations with the North. In May 1988, the North and South Yemeni governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions. They agreed to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of a national identification card.

In 1990, the parties reached a full agreement on joint governing of Yemen. Official Yemeni unification took place on 22 May 1990, with a planned, 30-month process, scheduled for completion in November 1992. The first stamp bearing the inscription &quot;Yemen Republic&quot; was issued in October 1990. Saleh and his system of patrons became the president of a united Yemen. While government ministries proceeded to merge, both currencies remained valid until 11 June 1996. Over time, the government of the united Yemen was able to integrate and unite two very different economic and political systems. However, the two Yemeni armies were not united. The 1994 civil war between the central government and southern Yemeni separatists delayed the completion of the final merger. the former YAR dominated the PDRY in a united Yemen, communists of South Yemen were persecuted, and the south became economically marginalized.
== Economy ==
The economies of both North and South Yemen were underdeveloped. However, communist South Yemen was able to provide a basic (and adequate) standard of living for all its citizens: equality, good education, and reduced corruption – all this is about South Yemen. Capitalist North Yemen was able to provide none of these. 

North Yemen’s economy has been devastated by civil war, and corruption and nepotism are widespread. The YAR’s budget deficit is 30 percent of GNP. The military took up to 50 percent of the national budget. Its exports are minimal, accounting for only 1 percent of its imports, and most of the country’s labor force remains rural. Many workers have emigrated from the country: more than a million of Yemen’s 7.5 million people live in other states on the peninsula (mostly Saudi Arabia). YAR remittances, at about $1 billion a year, represent about 40 percent of GNP. Foreign aid amounted to 17 percent of GNP in 1982. Saudi Arabia provides subsidies to northern tribes estimated at $60 million to $80 million a year.
=== Agriculture ===
About 85 percent of the country&#x27;s labor force works in agriculture, but the country is nevertheless dependent on imports for 30 percent of its food supplies. It has received significant aid from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

=== Oil production and export ===
Although oil was an important part of the YAR&#x27;s exports, the country had not been found to have large reserves. North Yemen has received significant aid from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, but is not a candidate for membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of six Arab oil producers on the peninsula established in May 1981. As one senior government official put it: &quot;There are reasons why we won&#x27;t be allowed to join. First, we&#x27;re a republic. Second, we&#x27;re poor. And third, if they let us in, they&#x27;ll have to let the Iraqis in, too.&quot;

== Politics and social life ==

=== Government ===
North Yemen was considered a Nasserist republic with Islam as its official religion. From 1974 to 1978, the country was ruled by a Nasserist military junta (with Hamdi and Ghashmi as presidents), but after Ali Abdullah Saleh came to power, there was a gradual shift from collective rule by a council of military officers to Saleh&#x27;s personal authoritarian dictatorship (and his patron system).

=== Foreign relations ===

Compared to South Yemen (which harbored revolutionary communists from all over the region), the North had better relations with many Arab countries. It criticized the peace initiatives undertaken by Egypt, but did not join the rejectionist camp. It established particularly good relations with Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, supporting it from the beginning in the war with Iran and selling some of its Soviet equipment to the Iraqis. It received economic aid from Kuwait, the Emirates, and was dependent on Saudi Arabia: for economic reasons, but also because of the influence it wields in North Yemen. 

The USSR and YAR never publicly clashed, and the YAR military still relied on Soviet arms (both directly and through intermediaries).

=== Living standards and medicine ===
The standard of living in the Yemen Arab Republic is very low. The country is mired in corruption and incompetence. Unlike the south, the north has failed to create a welfare state. In the republic, most of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of the elite or leaders of large tribes, and is not divided equally among the entire population. Rural health programs are negligible.

=== Education ===
Most North Yemenis have no education. In 1985, adult illiteracy was over 80 percent (compared to 2 percent illiteracy in south Yemen), and most children were not in school.

<text>South Yemen, officially the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen, abbreviated to Democratic Yemen, was a state that existed from 1967 to 1990 as the only communist state in the Middle East and the Arab world. It was made up of the southern and eastern governorates of the present-day Republic of Yemen, including the island of Socotra. It was bordered by North Yemen to the north-west, Saudi Arabia to the north, and Oman to the east.

South Yemen&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British Colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate, which consisted of two-thirds of present-day Yemen. Prior to 1937, what was to become the Colony of Aden had been governed as a part of British India, originally as the Aden Settlement subordinate to the Bombay Presidency and then as a Chief Commissioner&#x27;s province. After the collapse of Aden Protectorate, a state of emergency was declared in 1963, when the National Liberation Front (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) rebelled against the British rule. The Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate of South Arabia were overthrown to become the People&#x27;s Republic of Southern Yemen (PRSY) on 30 November 1967. 

On 22 June 1969, the Marxist–Leninist faction of the NLF led by Abdel Fattah Ismail and Salim Rubai Ali, overthrew the Nasserist President Qahtan al-Shaabi in an internal bloodless coup that was later called the Corrective Move. The Marxist–Leninist takeover later led to the creation of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), and South Yemen&#x27;s transformation into a one-party, socialist state. The official name of the state was changed a year after the reforms to the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), and was able to establish strong relations with Cuba, East Germany, North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region, it was involved in a brief civil war in 1986. The PDRY unified with the Yemen Arab Republic, on 22 May 1990 to form the present-day Republic of Yemen.

==History==
=== British rule and decolonization ===
In 1838, Muhsin Bin Fadl, Sultan of Lahej ceded of Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to occupy the territory and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India making Aden a part of British colonial rule from 1839 until 1937. In the 1920s, the British began expanding and annexing the multiple sheikhdoms surrounding Aden under the claim of protecting them. This was more a precautionary measure to prevent the Yemeni imams from storming Aden than a desire to annex the small sheikhdoms to the empire. In the mid-1950s, the British realized that they would not be able to manage the colonies and needed a stable political unit that would distance Aden from the wave of Arab nationalism that had swept the region and preserve for them influence and the ability to manage Aden from London, so they established the Federation of the Emirates of South Arabia in 1959. The federation did not succeed for several reasons, the first of which was the British insistence that Aden would be part of the entity, which was rejected by the commercial elite of Aden, most of whom were Indians, Persians, and Jews, because they feared for their future from the sheikhdoms. On the other hand, the leaders of the sheikhdoms feared that they would be overthrown later or that their influence would remain limited due to the dominance of the educated Aden elite, which was made up of a large number of non-Arabs and non-Muslims. In addition to all that was the sheikhdoms&#x27; differences over the who should be the president of the federation.

Following the establishment of the Federation of South Arabia on 1965, four sheikhdoms out of twenty-one had joined the union. The Qu&#x27;aiti and Kathiri sultanates of Hadhramaut refused to join either of the federations. Several resistance movements emerged, such as the National Liberation Front (NLF), whom were responsible for the wounding of British High Commissioner Kennedy Trevaskis on 10 December 1963 using a grenade, an event that sparked the 14 October Revolution which was influenced by the 26 September Revolution against the Imams in the North. The British had announced that they would withdraw by 1968 as a result of the revolution. The NLF and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) appeared in the 1960s, supporters of the NLF were from the countryside of Radfan, Yafa, and Ad-Dali, while the supporters of the FLOSY were mainly from Aden; This is because tribal affiliations played a major role in attracting supporters. 

The leaders of the NLF came from within the protected sheikhdoms and were not supported by the Egyptians at first, while the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen ran its operations from Aden and received support from Gamal Abdel Nasser, which made it appear as a follower of the Egyptians promoting Nasser’s agendas inside the country, the operations of these factions against the British were known to them as the Aden Emergency. The British tried to reach a compromise with these groups and found themselves waging a war on two fronts, trying to thwart the Republic in the north and the anti-English factions in the south.By 1965, most of the western protectorates had fallen to the National Liberation Front. As for Hadhramaut, it seemed calm until 1966 because the English presence there was less than its counterpart in the western protectorates. Ali Salem al-Baidh and Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas joined the National Liberation Front in Hadhramaut and prevented the sultans of the Kathiri Sultanate and the Qu&#x27;aiti Sultanate from entering the country, but allowed the Sultan of the Mahra Sultanate due to his old age. The commander of the Hadhrami Bedouin Legion was killed by one of his men in the same year, and Ali Salem Al-Beidh and Muhammad Salem Akash played a major role in gathering supporters in favor of the National Liberation Front, taking advantage of the near absence of the English presence in al-Mahra.

Qahtan Al-Shaabi was the only person the British knew because he was an agricultural engineer in his city of Lahij. When the British tried to negotiate with the National Liberation Front, Qahtan demanded immediate withdrawal and recognition of the legitimacy of his government, and that the British government provide aid double what it proposed to the union, and that all the islands associated with the Aden Protectorate be part of the new state. While the British demands were an orderly handover to the authorities, and that the new state not interfere in the affairs of any country in the Arabian Peninsula. The British were surprised by the presence of people they thought were loyal to them alongside the popular Qahtan. The NLF was invited to the Geneva Talks to sign the independence agreement with the British. During its occupation of Aden, the British had signed several treaties of protection with the local sheikhdoms and emirates of the Federation of South Arabia; however, these parties were excluded from the talks, and thus the agreement stated [...the handover of the territory of South Arabia to the (Yemeni) NLF...]. Southern Yemen became independent as the People&#x27;s Republic of Southern Yemen on 30 November 1967, and the National Liberation Front consolidated its control in the country. On 14 December 1967, the PDRY was admitted into the United Nations as a member state. the British announced that they would withdraw from 1968, which sparked the battles between the National Liberation Front and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen to monopolize the right to self-determination after the British left.

The National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen. Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. The last British soldier left Aden on 30 November 1967, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate in Hadhramaut were annexed to the new country. The lands of South Yemen are rugged and barren, a fact that played a role in the social, cultural and economic development of the south, unlike the northern regions of Yemen. Their population in 1967 did not exceed two million people, while northern Yemen exceeded six million. Most of the population of the south was concentrated in the western regions of Lahj and its environs, and these alone constituted more than 60% of the population, 10% were nomads. Qahtan al-Shaabi assumed the presidency of a state that had never existed before, with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, British support stopped, and the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.

The National Liberation Front had approximately 4,000 members, a small number of university-educated leaders, and all of them, without exception, had no experience in government. The front was divided into two right-wing and left-wing sections. The right-wingers and their popular leader, Qahtan, did not want to make major changes in the prevailing social and economic structure and took a conservative stance toward &quot;liberating all Arab lands from colonialism, supporting the resistance of the Palestinian people, and supporting socialist regimes around the world to resist imperialism and colonial forces in the Third World.&quot; The leftist section of the Liberation Front was also promoting and opposed the establishment of popular forces and proposals to nationalize lands, and they were not preoccupied with the struggle of social classes. Qahtan wanted the continuation of existing institutions and their development. The leftist section &quot;wanted a social and economic transformation that would serve the broad segment of the working people instead of the wealthy minority,&quot; as they put it. on 20 March 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership and was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year. On another level, in the months of July, August and December of 1968, the popular Qahtan faced new rebellions from leftist parties because all Arab countries welcomed the front. The National Liberation Front received a cold reception, as regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen. The leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan, and they wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.

On 11 December 1967, the lands of &quot;feudal symbols and British agents&quot; were confiscated, and the state was divided into six governorates. The aim of the move was to end tribal aspects in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms. On 16 June 1969, Qahtan fired Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham, but the latter withdrew his ties to With the tribes and the army, he was able to ally himself with Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, and they reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan Al-Shaabi. They were able to arrest him and place him under house arrest.

===1969 establishment of a Marxist-Leninist state===

On 22 June 1969, a radical Marxist wing of the NLF formed a presidential committee of five people, Salim Rubaya Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. they gained power in an event known as the Corrective Move. This radical wing reorganised the country into the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) on 30 November 1970. Subsequently, all political parties were amalgamated into the National Liberation Front, renamed the Yemeni Socialist Party, which became the only legal party. This group took an extreme leftist line and declared its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany. The United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalized foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the state to The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist-Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established. The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen established close ties with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Cuba, and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. East Germany&#x27;s constitution of 1968 even served as a kind of blueprint for the PDRY&#x27;s first constitution.

The new government embarked on a programme of nationalisation, introduced central planning, put limits on housing ownership and rent, and implemented land reforms. By 1973, the GDP of South Yemen increased by 25 percent. Despite the conservative environment and resistance, women became legally equal to men, polygamy, child marriage and arranged marriage were all banned by law and equal rights in divorce were sanctioned; all of supported and protected by the state General Union of Yemeni Women. The Republic also secularised education and sharia law was replaced by a state legal code. Slavery in Yemen, which had been abolished in North Yemen by the 1962 revolution, was now abolished also in South Yemen.

The major communist powers assisted in the building of the PDRY&#x27;s armed forces. Strong support from Moscow resulted in Soviet naval forces gaining access to naval facilities in South Yemen. The most significant among them, a Soviet naval and air base on the island of Socotra for operations in the Indian Ocean.

===Disputes with North Yemen===
Unlike the early decades of other partitioned states such as East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, or North Vietnam and South Vietnam, all of which faced tense relations or sometimes total wars, the relations between the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) and the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) remained relatively friendly throughout most of their existence, although conflicts did arise. Fighting broke out in 1972, and the short-lived conflict was resolved with negotiations, where it was declared unification would eventually occur.

However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, as the PDRY funded Red rebels in the YAR, and the war was only prevented by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.

In 1980, PDRY president Abdul Fattah Ismail resigned and went into exile in Moscow, having lost the confidence of his sponsors in the USSR. His successor, Ali Nasir Muhammad, took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman.

=== 1986 Civil War ===

On 13 January 1986, a violent struggle began in Aden between Ali Nasir&#x27;s supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail, who wanted power back. This conflict, known as the South Yemen Civil War, lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties, Ali Nasir&#x27;s ouster, and Ismail&#x27;s disappearance and presumed death. Some 60,000 people, including the deposed Ali Nasir, fled to the YAR. Ali Salim al-Beidh, an ally of Ismail who had succeeded in escaping the attack on pro-Ismail members of the Politburo, then became General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party.

===Reforms and attempts for unification===

Against the background of the perestroika in the USSR, the main backer of the PDRY, political reforms were started in the late 1980s. Political prisoners were released, political parties were formed, and the system of justice was reckoned to be more equitable than in the North. In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions, including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarise the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card. In November 1989, after returning from the Soviet–Afghan War, Osama bin Laden offered to send the newly formed al-Qaeda to overthrow the South Yemeni government on behalf of Saudi Arabia, but Prince Turki bin Faisal found the plan reckless and declined. In 1990, the parties reached a full agreement on joint governing of Yemen, and the countries were effectively merged as Yemen.

==Demographics==

South Yemen&#x27;s ethnic groups were, as of 2000, ethnic Yemeni Arabs (92.8%), Somalis (3.7%), Afro-Arab (1.1%), Indians and Pakistanis (1%), and other (1.4%).
===Religion===
South Yemen had a dual-sided approach to religion. State policy officially promoted Islam as the state religion, and government leaders performed public displays of religious observance to deflect accusations of anti-Islamism. However, the state also worked to diminish the role of religion in everyday life, especially that which it considered to be &#x27;popular&#x27; Islam out of alignment with the official creed. Sharia was replaced with secular law in personal and many other matters. Legal interpretation was often the province of secular officials, and the independence of sheikhs was limited by government control of religious trusts and mosque funds.

==Politics and social life==
South Yemen developed as a Marxist–Leninist, mostly secular society ruled first by the National Liberation Front, which later transformed into the ruling Yemeni Socialist Party. 

===Government===

The legislative body, the Supreme People&#x27;s Council, was elected by the people for a period of five years. The collective head of state, also known as the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council, was elected by the Supreme People&#x27;s Council for a period of five years as well.

The executive body was known as the Council of Ministers, and was formed by the Supreme People&#x27;s Council. Local representative bodies were the people&#x27;s councils, and their decisions were taken into account when the members of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council were governing. Local executive bodies were the executive bureaus of the people&#x27;s councils.

The highest court was the Supreme Court of South Yemen, other courts in the country included courts of appeal and the provincial courts, and the courts of first instance were known as the district courts or magistrate courts.

The only political party was the Yemen Socialist Party.

===Foreign relations===

The only avowedly Marxist–Leninist nation in the Middle East, South Yemen received significant foreign aid and other assistance from the USSR and East Germany, which stationed several hundred officers of the Stasi in the country to train the nation&#x27;s secret police and establish another arms trafficking route to Palestine. The East Germans did not leave until 1990, when the Yemeni government declined to pay their salaries which had been terminated with the dissolution of the Stasi during German reunification. However by the middle 1980s the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev largely shunned South Yemen.

Relations between South Yemen and several nearby states were poor. Saudi Arabia only established diplomatic relations in 1976, initially hosting pro-British exiles and supporting armed clashes in the border regions of South Yemen. Relations with Oman declined through the 1970s as the South Yemeni government supported the insurgent Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman (PFLO). Relations with Ba&#x27;athist Iraq were also low, as South Yemen offered asylum to a number of Iraqi communists.

The United States listed South Yemen as a “state sponsor of terrorism” between 1979 and the Yemeni reunification. Diplomatic relations with the United States had been broken on 24 October 1969 because of disagreements with US policy in the Middle East. They were not restored until shortly before reunification.

===Legislature and judiciary===
The Supreme People&#x27;s Council was appointed by the General Command of the National Liberation Front in 1971.

In Aden, there was a structured judicial system with a supreme court.

===Living standards===
Despite a poor economy, the government ensured a basic level of living standard for all citizens and established a welfare state. Income equality improved, corruption was reduced, and health and educational services expanded. Overall, the population was assured of a basic but adequate living standard for all.

=== Education ===

Democratic Yemen had a &quot;National Science Day&quot; on 10 September.

According to the UNESCO in 1985, education in Democratic Yemen was considered the best in the Arabian Peninsula and that the illiteracy rate was 2% of the population.

===Sports===
In 1976, the South Yemen national football team participated in the AFC Asian Cup, where the team lost to Iraq 1–0 and to Iran 8–0. They entered their only World Cup qualification campaign in 1986 and were knocked out in the first round by Bahrain. On 2 September 1965, South Yemen played their first international match against the United Arab Republic, to whom they lost 14–0. On 5 November 1989, South Yemen played its last international match against Guinea, to whom they lost 1–0. The team stopped playing when the North and South united in 1990 to form the modern state of Yemen.

In 1988, the South Yemen Olympic team made its debut in the Summer Olympics in Seoul. Sending only eight athletes, the country won no medals. This was the only time the country went to the Olympics until unification in 1990.

===Women&#x27;s rights===

Women&#x27;s rights under the socialist government were considered the best in the region. Women became legally equal to men and were encouraged to work in public; polygamy, child marriage, and arranged marriage were all banned; and equal rights in divorce received legal sanction.

==Administrative divisions==

Following independence, South Yemen was divided into six governorates (Arabic: &quot;muhafazat&quot;), with roughly natural boundaries. From 1967 to 1978, each given a name by numeral. The state changed this practice in the mid-1980s but gave the governorates geographical or historical names and ensured that their borders did not coincide with tribal allegiances. Today, this legacy contributes to misunderstanding and confusion when discussing political issues and allegiances in Yemen. The islands of Kamaran (until 1972, when it was seized by North Yemen), Perim, Socotra, Abd-el-Kuri, Samha (inhabited), Darsah and others uninhabited from the Socotra archipelago were districts (&quot;mudiriyat&quot;) of the First/Aden Governorate being under the Prime Minister&#x27;s supervision.

==Economy==
During British rule, economic development in South Yemen was restricted to the city of Aden, focused mainly on the port and on the British military bases. As a result, following the British withdrawal, there here was little to no industrial output or mineral wealth exploitation in the country until the mid-1980s, when significant petroleum reserves in the central regions near Shibam and Mukalla were discovered. Foreign aid was minimal, as the British government did not fulfill promises of aid and the Soviet Union offered only US$152 million from 1969 to 1980.

The main sources of income were agriculture, mostly fruit, cereal crops, cattle and sheep, and fishing. The government guaranteed full employment in agriculture for rural citizens, and established a number of collective farms, however, those set up following the Soviet model produced poorer results than cooperative-run farms.

The national budget was 13.43 million dinars in 1976, and the gross national product was US$650 - 500  million. The total national debt was $52.4 million. 

===Economic policy===
Limited natural resources posed challenges to the economic development of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Despite this constraint, significant, albeit modest, oil reserves were discovered shortly after the country&#x27;s unification in 1990. However, the YSP government did not benefit from oil exports to fund its development initiatives.

Over time, economic policies in the PDRY underwent a transformation, shifting from an initial focus on developing the state sector to promoting cooperative and joint private-public enterprises. By the late 1980s, there was a notable presence of industries in Aden and around Al Mukalla in Hadramawt, producing a range of essential goods such as plastics, batteries, cigarettes, matches, tomato paste, dairy products, and fish canning.

Within the industrial sector, the state implemented welfarist labor laws that were widely enforced. These laws included regulations aimed at safeguarding women in the workforce by prohibiting night shifts and hazardous occupations. Additionally, the legislation ensured that workers received salaries that enabled them to maintain reasonable living standards. Trade unions in the PDRY primarily functioned as state entities rather than as negotiating bodies, playing a significant role in upholding labor regulations and standards.

=== Oil ===
A few months after The Events of &#x27;86, the PDRY had discovered oil after more than 6 decades of unsuccessful exploration, the Soviet Union discovered oil in the Shabwah Governorate in late 1986, marking a turning point for the resource-scarce nation. Decades of unsuccessful exploration efforts, hampered by the harsh desert environment and political instability, had left South Yemen heavily reliant on foreign aid, primarily from the Soviet Union, and remittances from its citizens working abroad, estimated to be around half of government revenue by the mid-1980s. The discovery, made by the Soviet oil company Technoexport, emerged amidst the Cold War, with the Soviet Union playing a crucial role in the exploration and discovery process.

In 1980s, Technoexport contracted with the PDRY to search for oil in a 13,500-square-mile area in Shabwa, and, in 1984, launched a program of exploratory drilling. This Soviet effort yielded only traces of oil over the next two years, a sharp contrast to the discovery and rapid exploitation of oil in the same period by an American company, Hunt Oil, in- the YAR&#x27;s Marib basin, an area just to the west of Shabwa. Then, in late 1986, the Soviets struck very high quality oil in western Shabwa, an occurrence confirmed by authorities in Aden in early 1987.

By late March, Initial estimates placed the oil reserves at around 1 billion barrels, sparking plans for pipeline construction and full-scale production of the oil fields. events moved swiftly, and industry sources reported in mid-1987 that the three fields - &quot;lyad East&quot;, &quot;lyad West&quot;, and &quot;Amal&quot; already had a productive capacity of 10,000 barrels per day (bpd), that between 5,000-10,000 bpd were being trucked to the Aden refinery, and that there were plans to increase the number of trucks on the oil run to bring deliveries up to 25,000 bpd, considerably more than the PDRY&#x27;s total domestic need at the time. The discovery was viewed as a potential pathway to reduce dependence on external sources of income and improve the lives of South Yemen&#x27;s roughly 2.4 million citizens. However, the joy of discovery was accompanied by a multitude of challenges. 

Western Shabwa was not the only exploration area, and the Soviet Union was not the only explorer in the second half of the 1980s. Replying to a claim that the PDRY had put all of its eggs in one basket, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy and Minerals Salih Abu-Bakr ibn Husaynun noted in late 1987 that eight Western and Arab companies were engaged in exploration efforts in several areas in the PDRY. This count seems about right. Although Italy&#x27;s Agip stopped work in late 1985, Brazil&#x27;s Braspetrol, France&#x27;s Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine (Elf) and Compagnie Franqaise des Petroles (Total), Kuwait&#x27;s Independent Petroleum Group, and Canadian Occidental were among the firms actively searching for oil in the years that followed.

The Soviet involvement in the discovery, estimated to have cost over half a billion dollars and add to South Yemen&#x27;s already staggering debt, raised concerns about potential political and economic influence in the region. Additionally, the oil find added a layer of complexity to the already intricate relationship between South and North Yemen, both of which desired unification and saw the resource, estimated to hold the potential for substantial economic benefits, as a potential driver of economic prosperity.

Furthermore, South Yemen grappled with internal political struggles and social unrest at the time of the discovery. The violent leadership struggle within the ruling communist party, culminating in the January 1986 &quot;blood bath&quot; in Aden, further destabilized the nation. This volatile political landscape cast a shadow over the potential benefits of the newfound oil wealth and raised questions about how the resources would be managed and distributed fairly within the nation.

===Airlines===
The following airlines had operated from the PDRY:
*Aden Airways (1949–1967). Ceased operations on 30 June 1967 at the time of British withdrawal from the Federation and the Protectorate of South Arabia.
*Alyemda – Democratic Yemen Airlines (1961–1996). Joined Yemenia, the airline of the former YAR
*The Brothers Air Services was formed by Sayid Zein A. Baharoon who used the &quot;Brothers&quot; nomenclature in his merchant enterprises. Known as BASCO, this fledgling airline lasted only a short time.

<doc id="718750" wikidata="Q193490" url="?curid=718750" title="Queen (Queen album)">
<text>Queen is the debut studio album by the British rock band Queen. Released on 13 July 1973 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records in the US, it was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker, John Anthony and the band members themselves.

The album combines heavy metal and progressive rock with a folk influence. The lyrics are based on a variety of topics, including folklore (&quot;My Fairy King&quot;) and religion (&quot;Jesus&quot;). Lead singer Freddie Mercury wrote five of the ten tracks, lead guitarist Brian May wrote four songs (including &quot;Doing All Right&quot;, which he co-wrote with Tim Staffell while in the band Smile), and drummer Roger Taylor both wrote and sang &quot;Modern Times Rock and Roll&quot;. The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, the full version of which would appear on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Queen II&quot;.

The album was rereleased as a remixed, remastered and expanded box set entitled Queen I Collector&#x27;s Edition on 25 October 2024.

== Background ==
Queen, who played their first gig in the City Hall of Truro on 27 June 1970, had been playing the club and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when they were asked to test out the new recording facilities at De Lane Lea Studios. The band came away with a polished demo tape of five songs: &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, &quot;Great King Rat&quot;, &quot;Jesus&quot;, and &quot;Liar&quot;. The group sent their demo to various record labels, but only received one offer: a low bid from Charisma Records, which they declined as, according to their friend Ken Testi, they feared they &quot;would always play second fiddle to Genesis and those other bands&quot;.

Producers John Anthony and Roy Thomas Baker visited De Lane Lea while the band were recording and were impressed by what they saw. They recommended Queen to Barry and Norman Sheffield, who owned Trident Studios. The Sheffield brothers arranged for Queen to record at Trident; however, because the studio was very popular, Queen mainly recorded during studio downtime but were given free use of everything after the paying artists had left, including the latest technologies and production team. Trident also agreed to oversee the group&#x27;s management, recording and publishing interests while they sought a record deal. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Geoffrey Cable, who was working on a version of &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;. Mercury enlisted May and Taylor on the tracks, which were released on a single under the name Larry Lurex, a parody of Gary Glitter.

== Recording ==
The process of recording only during studio downtime—late evenings or overnight—lasted from April to November 1972. Roger Taylor recalled, &quot;You could see the working girls at night through their laced curtains, so while we were mixing, we would have a little bit of diversion&quot;. The limitations of this arrangement led the band to focus on completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy Thomas Baker had them re-record the songs with better equipment. &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it again, but no mix met their standards. After seven or eight failed attempts, engineer Mike Stone stepped in, and his first try met with Queen&#x27;s approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and eventually co-produce their next five albums. May later commented that &quot;Between Roy [Thomas Baker] and I, we were fighting the whole time to find a place where we had the perfection but also the reality of performance and sound&quot;.

Another track that proved problematic was &quot;Mad the Swine&quot;, which was to be the fourth track on the album between &quot;Great King Rat&quot; and &quot;My Fairy King&quot;. Baker and Queen disagreed over the drum sound and percussion, and it was left off the album. It re-surfaced in 1991, remixed by David Richards, as both the B-side to the &quot;Headlong&quot; CD single in the UK, and on the Hollywood Records re-release of the album.

Other songs known to have been recorded in this period are &quot;Polar Bear&quot; (an old Smile song by May &amp; Staffell) and &quot;Now That I&#x27;m Here&quot; (also by May, later reworked into &quot;Feelings, Feelings&quot; for the &quot;News of the World&quot; sessions). Other unconfirmed songs claimed to have been recorded during these sessions are &quot;Hangman&quot; (alternatively &quot;Waiting for the Hangman&quot; or &quot;Hangman Blues&quot;) by Mercury, and &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Medley&quot; (a medley of covers including &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;) and &quot;Silver Salmon&quot; by Staffell, (now confirmed to have also been recorded during the &quot;News of the World&quot; sessions, at an unknown date in Summer of 1977). It is also likely that songs from Queen&#x27;s next album, &quot;Queen II&quot;, and third album, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;, were also recorded for this album but saved for later projects and subsequently rerecorded.

== Songs ==
=== Overview ===
The music on &quot;Queen&quot; has been described as hard rock, progressive rock and heavy metal. The album showcased the influence of contemporary rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Jethro Tull, while the lyrics were reflective of &quot;mystical sword &#x27;n&#x27; sorcerers themes&quot; with &quot;medieval landscapes.&quot; Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; noted how &quot;mostly &quot;Queen&quot; is a product of its time, bringing together prog, metal and even a little bit of folk music&quot; and felt that the album &quot;did little to separate the group from others exploring similar territory in the early &#x27;70s.&quot; David Chiu of &quot;Medium&quot; opined that Mercury&#x27;s songs were similar in style to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, whereas Brian May&#x27;s songs &quot;were also baroque-sounding at times, albeit more introspective.&quot;

=== Side one ===
==== &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; ====

Brian May wrote &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; after the band had been formed but before John Deacon joined, as confirmed by former bass player Barry Mitchell (on an unofficial question and answer session held on an online forum). According to May in a radio special about their 1977 album, &quot;News of the World&quot;, he had penned the lyrics thinking of them as ironic and tongue-in-cheek, but their sense was completely changed when Mercury sang them. Taylor and May sing the vocal bridge of the song.

==== &quot;Doing All Right&quot; ====
&quot;Doing All Right&quot; was written by Brian May and Tim Staffell while in Smile, but was never released by Smile. This is one of the few Queen songs to feature May on the piano. He also played his old Hallfredh acoustic guitar on this track and on later tracks such as &quot;White Queen (As It Began)&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot;. The band played this song as early as 1970, and it was notable as the band&#x27;s first song Freddie Mercury played live on the piano. Staffell sang it when it was a Smile song, and Mercury tried to sing in the same manner when it became a Queen song. This song was played at nearly every Queen show from mid-1975 through the end of 1976, and was played occasionally during 1977.

==== &quot;Great King Rat&quot; ====
This song, written by Freddie Mercury, is an example of Queen&#x27;s earliest sound, with lengthy, heavy compositions, long guitar solos, and sudden tempo changes.

==== &quot;My Fairy King&quot; ====
&quot;My Fairy King&quot;, written by Freddie Mercury, deals with Rhye, a fantasy world he created with his younger sister and which features in other Queen songs, most notably &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;. Mercury borrowed some lines from Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;. The song was written while the band were in the studio, and contains many vocal overdubbed harmonies, which Mercury was fond of. Roger Taylor also displays his high vocal range, hitting the highest notes in the composition. The vocal overdubs technique would later be used in many Queen songs, most notably &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

Brian May said that after the lyric &quot;Mother Mercury, look what they&#x27;ve done to me&quot; was written, Mercury claimed he was singing about his own mother. Subsequently, Freddie Bulsara took the stage name Freddie Mercury. This was another attempt to separate him from his stage persona. As Mercury once explained, &quot;When I&#x27;m performing I&#x27;m an extrovert, yet inside I&#x27;m a completely different man.&quot;

&quot;My Fairy King&quot; is the first song on the album to feature Mercury&#x27;s piano skills – as the piano on &quot;Doing All Right&quot; was played by May, who was quite impressed by Mercury&#x27;s piano playing on the track. From this point on Mercury handled most of Queen&#x27;s piano parts.

==== &quot;Liar&quot; ====

Originally titled &quot;Lover,&quot; the rudiments of this song were written by Freddie Mercury and guitarist Mike Bersin from Mercury&#x27;s earlier group, Ibex. Queen reworked it, and Mercury took full credit since he had written the lyrics. As mentioned on the transcription on EMI Music Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Off the Record&quot; sheet music, this is one of the band&#x27;s few 1970s tracks to feature a Hammond organ. &quot;Liar&quot; was a staple of early concerts, but its inclusion was intermittent in later years, before returning in a shortened form for The Works Tour. For the Magic Tour, it was shortened to just the opening guitar section as a segue into &quot;Tear It Up&quot;.

==== &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; ====
Brian May wrote this song shortly after the band&#x27;s formation in 1970, following the break-up of Smile. It was first recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in January 1972, when the band were hired to test the studio&#x27;s new equipment in exchange for being allowed to record proper demos for their attempt to find a label.

In 1972, Trident Studios signed Queen to a recording contract, but limited them to work only during studio down-time. They began working with Roy Thomas Baker who, along with owners/management Norman and Barry Sheffield, insisted on re-recording the five De Lane Lea demos. A new version of &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; was recorded, but the band were unsatisfied with the results and the original demo was used on the album. With the release of the original De Lane Lea demos as bonus tracks in 2011, the difference in the mix of &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot; is quite noticeable when compared to the original LP and digital remasters. The demo is roughly the same mix that appeared on the album except for a distinct difference in the drum sound.

The song follows what would become trademark May themes such as coming-of-age, nostalgia over the loss of childhood, and the difficulties of adult life. There is also what could be an ambiguous reference to the Beatles song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, in the lyric: &quot;When I was young it came to me; And I could see the sun breaking; Lucy was high and so was I; Dazzling, holding the world inside.&quot; May is a Beatles fan and has commented in numerous interviews on their impact on him.

==== &quot;Modern Times Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; ====
Roger Taylor wrote and sang the song, which was re-recorded on two occasions for the BBC. The first dates from December 1973 and was broadcast on John Peel&#x27;s show. This version was eventually released on the 1989 Queen album &quot;At The Beeb&quot;, and sounds similar to the album version. The second re-recording dates from April 1974 and was first broadcast on Bob Harris&#x27;s show. The later version, only available on bootleg recordings prior to the release of &quot;On Air&quot;, differs from the original album version in its slower tempo and additional vocals from Mercury.

In the concert versions included in &quot;Live at the Rainbow &#x27;74&quot;, Mercury handled lead vocals.

==== &quot;Son and Daughter&quot; ====
&quot;Son and Daughter&quot; was written by Brian May and was the B-side for the single &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;. The song was played in the very first concert under the name of Queen in 1970. It was a regular feature in Queen&#x27;s live set until well into 1976. The song originally housed his famous guitar solo, but the album version does not feature the solo. The solo would not be properly recorded until 1974, with &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; from &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;. Until this time, and occasionally afterward, the guitar solo would take over the middle of &quot;Son and Daughter&quot; during concerts, allowing the rest of the band a bit of a rest and costume change.

Unlike other songs from Queen&#x27;s early period which crept back into circulation in the live set of their 1984–86 tours, such as &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; and &quot;In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited&quot;, &quot;Son and Daughter&quot; stayed off the setlists after Queen&#x27;s hit singles began to dominate their live show. The song is indicative of their very earliest sound, influenced by blues rock and heavy metal.

==== &quot;Jesus&quot; ====
The lyrics tell part of the story of Jesus of Nazareth. Freddie Mercury, credited with writing the song, was a Parsi Zoroastrian. The track features a two-chord rhythm section during the verses with a long instrumental break toward the end of the song. Because of the effects created by May&#x27;s Red Special guitar, among other things, many early followers of Queen viewed the band as something of a psychedelic rock band.

==== &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; ====

Mercury had only half-written &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; when they were recording the first album. They intended to use it as an outro here and start &quot;Queen II&quot; with the finished version. This idea was later abandoned, but the song would become Queen&#x27;s first hit single.

== Release ==
Though the album was completed and fully mixed by November 1972, Trident Studios spent months trying to get a record company to release it. After eight months of failing that, they took the initiative and released it themselves in a license deal with EMI Records on 13 July 1973. During this time, Queen had begun writing material for their next album, but they were disheartened by the album&#x27;s delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version), was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 and 13 July respectively). The US single was issued in October. By mid-January 1974, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; was getting airplay on U.S. progressive radio stations, according to Radio &amp; Records playlist information printed at the time. All countries had the B-side &quot;Son and Daughter&quot;. The album was released in the US on 4 September.

Elektra Records released a single of &quot;Liar&quot; in a heavily edited form on 14 February 1974, with the B-side &quot;Doing All Right&quot;. Elektra later reissued the edited version of &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; in July 1975, this time with a double B-side of &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Both versions are different from the album versions.

Hollywood Records released a CD single featuring five versions of &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; to promote the forthcoming &quot;Crown Jewels&quot; box set (1998). The versions on the CD are &quot;Long Lost Re-take&quot;, &quot;BBC Session No. 1 Version&quot;, &quot;Live Killers Version&quot;, &quot;Album Version (Unremastered)&quot;, and &quot;Album Version (1998 Remastered Version)&quot;.

== Reception ==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that this funky, energetic English quartet has all the tools they&#x27;ll need to lay claim to the Zep&#x27;s abdicated heavy-metal throne, and beyond that to become a truly influential force in the rock world. Their debut album is superb.&quot; The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; opined that &quot;Queen&quot; borrowed from other artists, but also compared the album favourably to Led Zeppelin, writing, &quot;the band manages to inject such a fresh, energetic touch to most of it that I don&#x27;t mind a bit... With its first album, Queen has produced a driving, high energy set which in time may be looked upon with the same reverence Led Zep 1 now receives.&quot; Illinois&#x27; &quot;Daily Herald&quot; also commended the record, writing &quot;Good listening is guaranteed in songs like &#x27;Keep Yourself Alive,&#x27; &#x27;Great King Rat&#x27; and &#x27;Doing All Right&#x27;.&quot;

In later years, AllMusic awarded the album three out of five stars, calling it a &quot;patchy but promising debut from a classic rock group&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Guitarist Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Queen&quot; the 19th most influential guitar album of all time. The album placed at number 54 in &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Albums You&#x27;ve Never Heard&quot; in 2011. In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; number 31 in the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;an entire album&#x27;s worth of riffs crammed into a single song&quot;. It has also been cited as heavy metal journalist Martin Popoff&#x27;s favorite record of all time. In an article published by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; written by Greg Kot, the album is given a generally positive rating overall as he compliments the band&#x27;s heavy sound combined with baroque arrangements.

Writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked &quot;Queen&quot; as the band&#x27;s second greatest album. He described it as a &quot;glorious hard rock marathon unlike anything else around at the time&quot;, and commented on the &quot;unmistakably unique sound of Brian May&#x27;s home-made guitar&quot;, the &quot;panoramic production of Roy Thomas Baker&quot; and the &quot;soaring voice of Freddie Mercury&quot;, adding &quot;the record was just too powerful, too multi-dimensional and too stunning to sit happily and contentedly in the grooves. The performances were all virtuoso.&quot;

== Track listing ==
===Original release===
All lead vocals by Freddie Mercury unless noted. The band included the comment &quot;and nobody played synthesiser&quot; on the album sleeve, a purist principle of May&#x27;s, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects, produced by guitar and vocals, as synthesisers. John Deacon was credited as &quot;Deacon John&quot;, but after the release of the album, he asked to be referred to by his real name. Roger Taylor was credited as Roger Meddows-Taylor, his full name, but that was discontinued after the next album.

== 2024 box set reissue ==
On 11 September 2024, Queen announced their debut album had been remixed, remastered and expanded in a 6CD+1LP box set titled Queen I Collector&#x27;s Edition, set to be released October 25. This expansion contains 63 tracks with 43 brand new mixes, comprising the album with its intended running order restored, intimate fly-on-the-wall audio of Queen in the studio, alternative takes, demos, rare live tracks, and previously unheard live recordings. This is also the first time a Queen album has received a new stereo mix. A 108-page book containing handwritten lyrics and memorabilia accompanies the release.

The first single of the box set, the 2024 mix of &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, was released in conjunction with the announcement on 11 September, with an official music video premiering on YouTube on 13 September, which had some backlash due to artificial intelligence used to generate the video. On 11 October, the new mix of &quot;Modern Times Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was released as a digital single. A special re-edited and restored edition of the &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; promo video was released in conjunction with the boxset on 25 October.

Sir Brian May wrote in the CD sleeve insert notes:&quot;This is not just a remaster, this is a brand new 2024 rebuild of the entire Queen debut album, which, with the benefit of hindsight, we have retitled QUEEN I. All the performances are exactly as they originally appeared in 1973, but every instrument has been revisited to produce the ‘live’ ambient sounds we would have liked to use originally. The result is “Queen“ as it would have sounded with today’s knowledge and technology – a first. Queen I is the debut album we always dreamed of bringing to you.&quot;Of the original mix, May said:“I remember saying to Roy Thomas Baker, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t really the sound we want.’ And he said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry, we can fix it all in the mix.’ And I think we all knew it ain&#x27;t going to happen. Now in 2024, it has been ‘fixed in the mix’.&quot;The new 2024 mix includes &quot;Mad the Swine&quot;, reinstated as the album&#x27;s fourth song in-between &quot;Great King Rat&quot; and &quot;My Fairy King&quot;. Previously unreleased material includes live versions of the song &quot;Jesus&quot;, the first time a live version of the song has been heard, and a cover of the Bo Diddley written blues standard &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, both from Queen&#x27;s second ever concert in London at Imperial College on 23 August 1970, also bassist Barry Mitchell&#x27;s first performance with the band. The box set also includes the first official release of the song &quot;Hangman&quot; in a live version from Queen&#x27;s concert at the San Diego Sports Arena on 12 March 1976, in one of its final live performances. Queen says a studio version does not exist, but the song was performed live sporadically from 1970 to the Japanese &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; tour in 1976.

<text>Cascade Mountain is in Essex County of New York. It is one of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks (36th) and is located in the Adirondack Park. Its name comes from a series of waterfalls on a brook near the mountain&#x27;s base. The lake it flows into and the pass between Cascade and Pitchoff mountains are also named Cascade.

Cascade Mountain towers over the Van Hoevenberg ski center, the venue for bobsledding at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

Of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks, Cascade is the most accessible and the most frequently climbed. The main trailhead is on Route 73, 6 miles (10 km) east of Lake Placid, at Cascade Pass, overlooking Cascade Lake. The summit is visible from the trailhead, a rare occurrence in the High Peaks.

The well-used trail follows red plastic markers and takes the hiker up 2.2 miles (4.6 km) and almost 2,000 vertical feet (600 vertical m) to the mountain&#x27;s bare-rock summit, which, while it resembles the alpine summits found on many higher peaks, is instead the result of a 1903 fire.

Views are possible in all directions, and on a clear day with good weather one often finds many hikers on the summit.

Porter Mountain, another of the High Peaks, is an easy side-trip. The summit of Porter Mountains is 0.7 miles from Cascade Mountain Trail. The two summits can be reached together on a 6.2-mile hike.
