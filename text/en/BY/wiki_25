<text>Benjamin Todd Roethlisberger Sr. ( ; born March 2, 1982), nicknamed &quot;Big Ben&quot;, is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football for the Miami RedHawks, and was selected by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) of the 2004 NFL draft.

Roethlisberger earned the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2004 and his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007. In 2006, he became the youngest Super Bowl–winning quarterback in NFL history, winning Super Bowl XL 21–10 over the Seattle Seahawks in his second season at the age of 23. Roethlisberger led the Steelers to a second Super Bowl title in four seasons as they defeated the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, 27–23, after completing a game-winning touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left in the game. He appeared in his third Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLV, but the team lost by a score of 31–25 to the Green Bay Packers.

Roethlisberger was one of the most prolific passers in NFL history. Upon retirement, he ranked 5th all-time in NFL career passing yards (64,088), 8th all-time in touchdowns (418), and 5th in completions (5,440) among quarterbacks with a minimum of 1,500 career attempts. He also had the fourth-highest career winning percentage (.710) as a starter in the regular season among quarterbacks with a minimum of 100 starts and was one of six quarterbacks in NFL history to have beaten at least 31 of the current 32 NFL teams.

Known for playing outside the passing pocket in what he calls &quot;backyard football&quot;, Roethlisberger grew up idolizing John Elway and has often been compared to him, wearing number 7 in his honor.

==Early life==
At Findlay High School in Findlay, Ohio, Roethlisberger was captain of the Trojans&#x27; football, basketball, and baseball teams. Roethlisberger did not play quarterback until his senior year, giving way to the coach&#x27;s son, Ryan Hite. Instead, Roethlisberger played wide receiver. &quot;I&#x27;m a nationally known knucklehead in many people&#x27;s eyes,&quot; Hite conceded in a 2004 interview to the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; but insisted his decision had not been an act of nepotism, or miscalculation. &quot;We did a bunch of drills and my son throwing to Ben was a better combination,&quot; he said.

Ken Roethlisberger, a former Georgia Tech quarterback, never publicly criticized Hite for playing Ryan ahead of his son Ben. He has stated, &quot;It was a coach&#x27;s call. You make good ones, you make bad ones. And I&#x27;m not even saying this was a bad one. We can say it was now, but how do we know for sure?&quot; Ryan Hite went on to Denison University where, as a wide receiver, set numerous career and single-season records by the time he graduated from college.

==College career==
===2000–2001===
Roethlisberger played college quarterback at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. After arriving at Miami in 2000, he was redshirted his first season. In the 2001 season, he made his collegiate debut against Michigan, completing 18 of 35 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–13 loss. Against Akron, he broke the school single-game passing record with 399 passing yards, with 70 of those yards coming on a Hail Mary to Eddie Tillitz to win the game by a score of 30–27 as time expired. When Miami played Bowling Green, he had two touchdowns and 305 passing yards and broke the MAC freshman passing yardage record in the 24–21 victory. Against Hawaii, he broke school records for attempts, completions, and yardage, when he went 40 of 53 for 452 yards and three touchdowns in the 52–51 loss. He finished his first year with the Redhawks with 3,105 passing yards, 241 completions, and 25 touchdown completions while leading them to a 7–5 record.

===2002===

Roethlisberger&#x27;s second season as the RedHawks starter was marked with a 7–5 record once again. He broke the MAC single-game record for passing yards in a 48–41 loss against Northern Illinois on October 12 when he threw for 525 yards and four touchdowns. He won the MAC East Special Teams Player of the Week for three punts that landed inside the 20 in the 27–13 victory over Toledo. He established the Miami single-season record with 3,238 passing yards and 271 completions in 2002.

===2003===

After starting the season with a loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes, Roethlisberger led the Miami RedHawks to an unbeaten record in the MAC, 12 consecutive wins, a #10 ranking in the Associated Press poll, and a 49–28 victory over Louisville in the 2003 GMAC Bowl. He finished his 2003 season with a conference-leading 343 completions, 4,486 passing yards, and 37 passing touchdowns, breaking school single-season records in all three categories. He was named as the MAC Offensive Player of the Year for the 2003 season.

His jersey number number 7 was retired by the RedHawks during homecoming on October 13, 2007; the festivities included the RedHawks football game against Bowling Green. Roethlisberger became the third athlete in Miami football history to have his number retired, joining John Pont and Bob Hitchens. Roethlisberger&#x27;s number being retired was the first time in 34 years Miami retired a football jersey number.

==Professional career==


When ESPN began broadcasting MAC games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays—days without other football on television—in 2000, nationwide &quot;MACtion&quot; audiences watched Roethlisberger&#x27;s teams. The success of the 2003 Miami Redhawks led to the expectation that he would be drafted early. At the combine, Roethlisberger scored a 25 on the Wonderlic. During the GMAC Bowl, commentators discussed some of his skills that would translate to success in the NFL. Roethlisberger was one of the players invited to attend the draft along with others in the &quot;Green Room&quot; and was featured on the show &quot;Hey Rookie, Welcome to the NFL&quot;.

During the 2004 NFL draft, Roethlisberger was the second-highest touted quarterback behind Ole Miss&#x27; Eli Manning. He was projected to be taken by the New York Giants as the fourth overall pick, with the San Diego Chargers taking Manning first overall. While the Chargers drafted Manning, the Giants instead selected NC State quarterback Philip Rivers as part of a trade deal that sent Manning to the Giants and Rivers to the Chargers. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Roethlisberger 11th overall, making him the highest-drafted quarterback to play for the team that picked him, and the highest draft pick the Steelers used on a quarterback since selecting Terry Bradshaw first overall in 1970.

The Steelers almost didn&#x27;t select Roethlisberger, as head coach Bill Cowher and director of football operations Kevin Colbert had planned to select Arkansas guard Shawn Andrews. However, Steelers owner Dan Rooney overrode both Cowher and Colbert upon seeing that Roethlisberger was still available and the Steelers not wanting a repeat of passing on a franchise quarterback, as they had done in the 1983 NFL draft when they drafted Gabriel Rivera while local product Dan Marino was still available. Roethlisberger was being interviewed live on ESPN by Suzy Kolber when he received the phone call from Cowher, confirming his selection before it was officially announced by Paul Tagliabue.

Roethlisberger was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Manning and Rivers. All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the aforementioned 1983 Draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Marino. A two-time Super Bowl winner and six-time Pro Bowler, Roethlisberger leads the three in wins, winning percentage, and postseason appearances, and had the longest career among them.

===2004===
On August 4, Roethlisberger signed a six-year contract to the Steelers worth $22.26 million in salaries and bonuses, with an additional $17.73 million available via incentives. He was touted by Steelers head coach Bill Cowher in a press conference as a franchise quarterback.

He started his rookie season as the third quarterback on the depth chart behind veterans Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. When Batch was injured in the preseason, however, Roethlisberger took over the backup quarterback role. Maddox started, and won, the season opener against the Oakland Raiders and started versus the Baltimore Ravens, but after an ineffective outing and third-quarter injury to Maddox, Roethlisberger stepped in for his first NFL action. Despite spurring a mild comeback, the Steelers lost to the Ravens by a score of 30–13. In his regular season debut against the Ravens, Roethlisberger completed 12 of 20 passes for 176-yards and two touchdowns, and two interceptions. During the game, he threw his first career touchdown, on a three-yard pass to Antwaan Randle El and also threw his first career interception to Ravens linebacker Adalius Thomas. Maddox&#x27;s injury changed the Steelers&#x27; original plan for Roethlisberger, which was for him to sit on the bench or play sparingly during the first season or two in order to learn the team&#x27;s system. Instead, he started the third game of the season against the Miami Dolphins, finishing the 13–3 victory with 12 of 22 completions, 163 passing yards, one touchdown, and an interception. In Week 6, in a 24–20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, he was 21 of 25 for 193 passing yards and two touchdowns to earn his first AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.

As a rookie, he went 13–0 in the regular season (14–1 including playoffs) as a starting quarterback, helping the Steelers become the first AFC team to have 15 wins (2–1 under Maddox [first two and last game], 13–0 under Roethlisberger) in a single regular season, surpassing former Steeler Mike Kruczek for the record for the best start by a rookie (6–0) and exceeding the mark for total wins as a rookie, set by Chris Chandler and Joe Ferguson. On January 5, Roethlisberger was unanimously selected as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press, the first quarterback in 34 years to be so honored. In addition, he was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.

On October 31, he had one of his biggest games, leading the Steelers to a 34–20 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion and previously undefeated New England Patriots, ending their NFL-record 21-game winning streak. He completed 18 of 24 pass attempts for 196 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers. The next game, the Steelers defeated the also previously undefeated Philadelphia Eagles 27–3, with Roethlisberger going 11 of 18 for 183 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception.

On December 5, he led the Steelers to a 17–16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was near-perfect on the night, completing 14 of 17 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. Jeff Reed&#x27;s 37-yard field goal in the final minute gave the Steelers and Roethlisberger their tenth straight win.

Two weeks later, Roethlisberger faced off against the New York Giants and the first overall pick of the 2004 draft, Eli Manning. Roethlisberger posted his first career 300-yard passing game, with 18 of 28 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown. He led his fifth game-winning drive of the season, capping a drive with a Jerome Bettis touchdown run for a 33–30 victory.

In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the New York Jets, Roethlisberger threw two interceptions. One interception was returned for a touchdown, and the other was thrown with 2:03 left in the fourth quarter, which set up a potential game-winning field goal by Jets kicker Doug Brien. Brien missed the kick as time expired (his second missed kick in the last two minutes of the game), forcing the game into overtime. In overtime, Roethlisberger led the Steelers down the field and put them in position for the game-winning field goal, a 33-yard attempt that was made by Jeff Reed, sending the Steelers into the AFC Championship for the fourth time in 10 years.

On January 23 in the AFC Championship Game in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger completed 14 of 24 pass attempts for 226 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three costly interceptions, one of which was returned 87 yards for a touchdown by Rodney Harrison. The Steelers lost the game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, by a score of 41–27.

===2005: First Super Bowl championship===
In the 2005 regular season, the Steelers finished with an 11–5 record. After securing an AFC Wild Card spot en route to victory in the Super Bowl, the Steelers pulled off upsets at Indianapolis and Denver in the AFC playoffs in addition to wins over the higher seed Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks.

During the course of the regular 2005 season, Roethlisberger missed four games due to various knee injuries. The Steelers went 9–3 with Roethlisberger at quarterback and 2–2 without him. He led the league in yards per attempt, with an 8.90, and finished third in passer rating behind Peyton Manning and Carson Palmer with a 98.6.
The Super Bowl run began on January 8 as Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to a Divisional Round playoff win over the Cincinnati Bengals—an AFC North rival that had beaten the Steelers by seven points in the regular season to win the division championship. The rematch featured two teams with identical records, having split their regular season series since each team won on the road. Early in the game on Carson Palmer&#x27;s first throw, a tackle by former Bengal Kimo von Oelhoffen resulted in Palmer&#x27;s anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being completely torn. The Bengals&#x27; backup quarterback, Jon Kitna, came in and led the Bengals to leads of 10–0 and 17–7. However, the 17–7 lead midway through the second quarter was the last time in the 2005 postseason that the Steelers trailed an opponent by more than three points. After Kitna failed to produce, the Steelers took advantage by taking the next 24 straight points, and the win, in a 31–17 victory in Cincinnati.

Their second road win came on January 15 when Roethlisberger led the Steelers against the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round, the NFL&#x27;s top team throughout the season and a heavy favorite to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger threw for 197 yards and recorded a game-saving tackle on Colts&#x27; defensive back Nick Harper, who had just recovered a Jerome Bettis fumble with less than two minutes left in the game. Pittsburgh led early but had to survive a Colts comeback to win 21–18, after an errant call that the NFL later admitted was a mistake, which overturned a Troy Polamalu interception that would have secured the game for the Steelers. Roethlisberger&#x27;s tackle on Harper, dubbed by many as The Tackle II or The Immaculate Redemption, was compared by many to &quot;The Immaculate Reception&quot; in 1972, when Franco Harris made a miraculous reception and scored the game-winning touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. The victory marked the first time in playoff history that a sixth-seeded NFL playoff team defeated the top-seeded team.

On January 22, 2006, the Steelers defeated the Denver Broncos by a score of 34–17 in Denver to win the AFC Championship and advance to Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger completed 21 of 29 passes for 275 yards and threw two touchdown passes and scored one touchdown himself on a four-yard play-action bootleg. His run was the last touchdown of the game, sealing the win for the Steelers.

The Steelers won Super Bowl XL 21–10 over the Seattle Seahawks in Detroit on February 5. Roethlisberger had one of the worst passing games of his career, completing just nine of 21 passes for 123 yards and two interceptions; his passer rating of 22.6 was the lowest in Super Bowl history by a winning quarterback. Though he did convert eight third-down situations in the game to help the Steelers win, none of them was bigger than his 37-yard pass to Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward on a third-and-28 that set up the Steelers&#x27; first touchdown (a one-yard quarterback sneak by Roethlisberger on third and goal). With the victory, Roethlisberger, at 23 years old, became the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, a record previously held by Tom Brady of the New England Patriots.

===2006===

After an off-season motorcycle crash in which he was seriously injured, Roethlisberger missed the opening game of the 2006 season after having an emergency appendectomy on September 3. Backup Charlie Batch started and led the Steelers to a victory over the Miami Dolphins. Roethlisberger played the following game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. His return resulted in a sub-par performance as he threw two interceptions with no touchdowns in a 9–0 loss. In Week 3, Roethlisberger completed fewer than half of his passes for three interceptions and no touchdowns in a 28–20 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. The final interception came in the final seconds of the game, in the end zone, ending Pittsburgh&#x27;s comeback attempt.
In Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers, Roethlisberger looked sharp throughout the first half, leading three scoring drives. However, in the second half, he threw two interceptions, both of which shifted momentum away from the Steelers and led to the Chargers&#x27; 23–13 win. In Week 6 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roethlisberger had his first big game of the season, completing 16 of 19 passes for 238 yards with two touchdowns (his first of the year) and no interceptions during a 45–7 rout of the Chiefs. During Week 7 in Atlanta, Roethlisberger continued his success, going 16 of 22 for 237 yards and three touchdowns. However, during the third quarter, Roethlisberger was helped off the field after sustaining a concussion following a controversial hit by Falcons defensive end Patrick Kerney. Roethlisberger was replaced by Charlie Batch, and the Steelers went on to lose 41–38 in overtime.

On October 29 against the Oakland Raiders, Roethlisberger threw four interceptions in a 20–13 upset loss. The loss was his fifth of the season—two more than he had in his first two seasons combined as a starter—and gave him a total of 11 interceptions, versus just six touchdowns, on the season. In a Week 9 rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos, Roethlisberger threw for a career-high 433 yards but had three of the six Steelers turnovers in a 31–20 loss. Roethlisberger and the Steelers got back on a winning track in a home game a week later against the New Orleans Saints. He passed for 265 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–31 win.

In Week 11, Roethlisberger overcame three first-half interceptions by throwing for 224 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, leading the Steelers to score 21 points and come back to beat the Cleveland Browns, 24–20. The following week, Roethlisberger and the Steelers were held scoreless in a 27–0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Roethlisberger finished 21 of 41 for 214 yards and two interceptions. He was sacked nine times, including once by Ravens linebacker Bart Scott, which sent him to the sidelines briefly. He also fumbled once, which the Ravens returned for a touchdown in the second half. Roethlisberger bounced back the following game, throwing for 198 yards and two touchdowns in a 20–3 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Pittsburgh kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 with a 27–7 victory against the Browns. Roethlisberger went 11 of 21 for 225 yards with one touchdown, and rushed for one more. In Week 15, Roethlisberger threw for 140 yards and a touchdown in a 37–3 rout of the Carolina Panthers. The following week, Baltimore eliminated Pittsburgh from the playoffs. In the 31–7 defeat, Roethlisberger was intercepted twice and threw for 156 yards.

Roethlisberger ended the season on a good note by defeating the Cincinnati Bengals by a score of 23–17 in overtime and eliminating them from playoff contention in what was Bill Cowher&#x27;s final game as the Steelers&#x27; head coach. He was 19 for 28 passing with 280 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. In overtime, Roethlisberger completed a slant pass to rookie Santonio Holmes, who went 67 yards for the game-winning touchdown.

===2007===

In Week 1 against the Cleveland Browns, Roethlisberger threw four touchdown passes in a game for the first time in his NFL career as he led the Steelers to a win in the debut of new Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. Against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 4, Roethlisberger looked to get a win over his former offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt, who was then the head coach of the Cardinals. However, Roethlisberger had his first loss of the season as he was intercepted twice; once in the red zone, and then on a desperation pass with six seconds left in the game.
In Week 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger passed for a career-high five touchdown passes, which tied the team record held by Terry Bradshaw and Mark Malone. All five touchdowns were thrown in the first half, making Roethlisberger one of two quarterbacks in the 2007 season (the other being Tom Brady), and only the fifth quarterback since the 1970 merger, to accomplish such a feat. He also posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating. Against the Browns in Week 10, Roethlisberger helped the Steelers erase a 15-point deficit against the rival Browns in a 31–28 victory. He passed for 278 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

In Week 12 against the Miami Dolphins, Roethlisberger set a Steelers record, completing 85.7% of his passes (18 of 21) as the Steelers beat the Miami Dolphins, 3–0—a feat made all the more remarkable given the weather conditions. Pittsburgh was hit with a torrential storm, delaying the Monday night game 30 minutes due to lightning, while turning the new sod on the field, laid earlier that week, into a soggy mess. In many parts of the field, players sunk several inches with each step. After one of the game&#x27;s punts, the ball infamously stood straight up, stuck in the ground upon impact. With the game scoreless in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger led a game-winning field goal drive for the only points of the night.

Roethlisberger threw his 29th touchdown pass of the season in Week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, breaking the team single-season touchdown pass record previously held by Bradshaw. In Week 16 against the St. Louis Rams, Roethlisberger became the first quarterback in NFL history to have two perfect passer rating (158.3) games in the same regular season, completing 16 of 20 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns. It was his third career-perfect passer rating game, tying Peyton Manning for the most such regular-season games in NFL history. He earned his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nod for the 2007 season.

To cap his comeback season, Roethlisberger was selected to his first Pro Bowl, joining five other Steelers teammates on the AFC squad. Roethlisberger&#x27;s 32 touchdown passes ranked third in the NFL, behind Tony Romo and Tom Brady, while his 104.1 passer rating was second only to Brady. Roethlisberger also set a new Steelers single-season record with 32 touchdown passes.

In a rematch of the Week 15 game, the Steelers were defeated by the Jaguars in the AFC Wild Card Round, 31–29. In the loss, Roethlisberger passed for 337 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Roethlisberger finished third in Comeback Player of the Year voting, behind the Patriots&#x27; Randy Moss and the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; Greg Ellis, who won the award. Roethlisberger played in his first Pro Bowl in Hawaii.

===2008: Second Super Bowl championship===
On March 4, 2008, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Roethlisberger agreed to an eight-year, $102 million contract. Roethlisberger had two years left on his original that he signed after the draft. He stated at the time that he wanted to retire as a Steeler.

In Week 1 against the Houston Texans, Roethlisberger completed 13 of 14 passes for a career-high 92.9 completion percentage (minimum 10 attempts), and finished with 137 yards passing and two touchdown passes in the 38–17 win. Byron Leftwich took over in the fourth quarter when Roethlisberger was on the sideline with a shoulder injury. The next week against the Cleveland Browns, he had the first pass reception of his career: a negative-seven-yard completion to himself after a deflected pass in the second quarter. In a 15–6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 3, Roethlisberger was sacked eight times, fumbled twice, threw one interception, and was called for a safety in the fourth quarter. He did not finish the game, as his throwing hand was injured.

In Week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers trailed 13–3 at halftime. Roethlisberger threw a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes in the third quarter to start a comeback. He completed two passes to Mewelde Moore for 31 yards in overtime, setting up Jeff Reed for the winning 46-yard field goal. The next week, Roethlisberger threw for 239 yards in the first half—a career-high for one half—and directed the game-winning drive, passing for an eight-yard touchdown to Hines Ward to defeat the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 26–21. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air Player of the Week for his performance.

Roethlisberger had one of the worst performances of his career in a Week 9 23–6 win over the Washington Redskins, posting career lows in passer rating (15.1), completions (5), passing yards (50), yards per attempt (2.94) and completion percentage (29.4%). In Week 13 at New England, in consistent rain, Roethlisberger completed 17 of 33 passes for 179 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. After falling behind, 10–3, in the second quarter, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to 30 unanswered points in a 33–10 victory.
Against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 14, Roethlisberger had his 49th victory as a starting quarterback, breaking the record for the most wins by a quarterback in their first five NFL seasons. The Steelers clinched the AFC North in Week 15 with a win over the Baltimore Ravens, and with a loss to the Tennessee Titans the following week clinched the No. 2 seed in the playoffs. The Steelers defeated the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship en route to the Super Bowl.
In Super Bowl XLIII against the Arizona Cardinals, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to one of the most dramatic victories in Super Bowl history. On the first two offensive drives, Roethlisberger passed for 122 yards on seven of eight passing attempts, which was one yard shy of his total amount from his first Super Bowl start. The Steelers led, 10–0, and went into halftime up, 17–7. The lead grew to 20–7 before Arizona mounted a comeback. Trailing for the first time in the game, 23–20, with 2:30 remaining in the game, Roethlisberger took the field to start the winning drive. After a holding penalty on the first play, Roethlisberger marched the Steelers 88 yards in eight plays, connecting with the game&#x27;s MVP, Santonio Holmes, four times for 73 yards on the drive, including the six-yard touchdown pass that put the Steelers ahead with 0:35 remaining. After a LaMarr Woodley strip sack and a fumble recovery by Brett Keisel, Roethlisberger and the Steelers offense went back on the field to kneel the ball and run the clock out, ensuring Pittsburgh&#x27;s victory. Overall, Roethlisberger finished 21 of 30 for 256 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He had a passer rating of 93.2.

===2009===
In Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers were dominant in the first half and led, 20–9, in the fourth quarter, but the defense surrendered the lead with 14 seconds left. Roethlisberger got the ball back with two seconds remaining and his Hail Mary attempt was incomplete. It was his first NFL loss in the state of Ohio, snapping an 11–0 record. He improved his record of 10–0 against the Cleveland Browns by throwing for 417 yards and 2 touchdowns in Week 6. In Week 11 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had thrown for 398 yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game in overtime after taking a knee to the helmet on a scramble attempt. He suffered the fourth concussion of his NFL career. After sitting out the overtime loss in Week 12 at Baltimore, Roethlisberger started against the Oakland Raiders in Week 13 and passed for 278 yards and two touchdown passes. He threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Hines Ward with 1:56 remaining, only to have the Raiders answer back with a winning touchdown with nine seconds left. The Steelers could not hold three leads in the fourth quarter. They led 10–6, 17–13 and 24–20. It was the fifth loss of the season in which they surrendered the lead in the final quarter.

On a frigid Thursday night in Cleveland in Week 14, Roethlisberger was sacked 8 times and did not lead a touchdown drive in his first career loss to Cleveland, ending a perfect 10–0 record against the rival Browns. It is the first time he lost four straight starts.

In Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers, Roethlisberger broke several franchise passing records in ending the five-game losing streak for the Steelers with the biggest passing day in franchise history. His first pass of the day was a 60-yard touchdown to Mike Wallace, and his last pass was a game-winning 19-yard touchdown to Wallace on the final play of the game. He passed for 503 yards, three touchdowns, and had no turnovers. He broke Terry Bradshaw&#x27;s single-season record of 3,724 passing yards, and set a new mark for single-season completions (302). After leading a FG drive to take a 30–28 lead, the defense again surrendered the lead and the Steelers trailed, 36–30. Roethlisberger used all 2:01 he had left to drive the team 86 yards for the winning touchdown with no time remaining. Roethlisberger was named AFC Player of the Week for his effort; the fifth time he has won that award in his career.

In Week 16 against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger&#x27;s 259-yard effort helped him become the first quarterback in franchise history to pass for over 4,000 yards in a single season. With the game tied at 20 in the final quarter, he led the Steelers on the game-winning field goal drive as they improved to 8–7.

Roethlisberger finished the season with 4,328 yards and 26 touchdown passes. He was 9–6 as a starter and his 100.5 passer rating was the second time in his career he had a season with a rating over 100. He was sacked 50 times in 2009. Despite the three game win streak to end the season, the Steelers did not make the playoffs after tie-breakers eliminated them. Roethlisberger was voted as team MVP by the Steelers for the first time in his career. He was selected as the first alternate to the Pro Bowl, but declined the invitation to rest his right shoulder which was injured in the Miami game.

===2010: Third Super Bowl appearance===

In Week 6 against the Cleveland Browns, after being suspended for the first four games of the season under the NFL player conduct policy, Roethlisberger returned to the Steelers. In his first game of the season he completed 16 of 27 passes for 258 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception.

In Week 7 against the Miami Dolphins, with the Steelers trailing, 22–20, with 2:37 remaining in the game, Roethlisberger was at the center of controversy when he ran a QB draw and dove for the end zone, appearing to score a touchdown in the process. The play was ruled a touchdown on the field, but reviews showed Roethlisberger had fumbled short of the end zone. However, the review failed to provide conclusive evidence as to who recovered the ball after the fumble. By rule, possession was given to Pittsburgh, resulting in the game-winning field goal. Roethlisberger passed for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns in the game. &quot;Just a bizarre kind of play. You hate to win it that way, but you&#x27;ll take a win,&quot; Roethlisberger said.

In Week 8 against the New Orleans Saints, Roethlisberger, playing in his 90th regular season game, reached the 20,000-yard passing mark, but failed to throw a touchdown pass as the Steelers lost on Halloween night in the Superdome. Roethlisberger improved to 8–2 as a starter on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in Week 9 against the Cincinnati Bengals, and 63–27 over his first 90 regular season starts (tied with Jim McMahon for third-highest win percentage through a player&#x27;s first 90 starts). Roethlisberger passed for a season-high 387 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Week 10, 39–26 loss, to the New England Patriots, but also had an interception returned for a score and was sacked five times as he tried to rally the Steelers from a 23–3 deficit in the second half.

In his first win over the Oakland Raiders in Week 11, Roethlisberger passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns, and rushed for a career-high 55 yards and a touchdown. Celebrating a second-quarter touchdown pass, Roethlisberger was punched in the face by Raiders&#x27; defensive lineman Richard Seymour, who was then ejected. Roethlisberger was questionable to start the Week 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens with a foot injury, but did start the game and suffered a broken nose on the first series after a hit to the face from Haloti Ngata. Trailing 10–6 in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Isaac Redman with 2:51 remaining and the Steelers held on for the 13–10 win as he finished with 253 yards passing.

In Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, the Steelers clinched the AFC North and the #2 seed in the AFC playoffs. In the 41–9 victory, he finished with 280 passing yards and two touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He finished the season with a 9–3 record in 12 starts, passing for 3,200 yards, 17 touchdowns and a career-low five interceptions.

Late in the first quarter of the AFC Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger was sacked and fumbled the ball, and after both teams thought the pass was incomplete, it was eventually picked up by Cory Redding for a Baltimore touchdown. The Steelers trailed, 21–7, in the third quarter before Roethlisberger completed touchdown passes to Heath Miller and Hines Ward to tie the game at 21. With just over two minutes left, the game was tied, 24–24, and the Steelers faced a 3rd and 19. Roethlisberger completed a deep pass to rookie wide receiver Antonio Brown for 58 yards and Rashard Mendenhall&#x27;s rushing touchdown put the Steelers ahead for good, 31–24, with 1:33 left. It was Roethlisberger&#x27;s third game-winning drive in a playoff game. He finished with 19 completions on 32 attempts for 226 yards and 2 touchdown passes.

In the AFC Championship against the New York Jets, Roethlisberger rushed for a touchdown in the first half as the Steelers built a 24–0 lead, before the Jets scored 19 unanswered points. With two minutes remaining in the game, Roethlsiberger faced a 3rd and 6. He scrambled right and completed a 14-yard pass to Antonio Brown to seal the victory for Pittsburgh, sending them to their third Super Bowl appearance in the last six seasons. Roethlisberger completed 10 of 19 passes for a season-low 133 yards and two interceptions in the 28–21 victory.

In Super Bowl XLV against the Green Bay Packers, Roethlisberger was hit as he attempted a pass to Mike Wallace in the first quarter, and it was intercepted for a touchdown by Nick Collins. The Steelers trailed, 21–3, in the second quarter before Roethlisberger completed a touchdown pass to Hines Ward to make it 21–10 at halftime. The Steelers closed to within 21–17 in the third quarter, but were unable to score on their next three drives. After falling behind, 28–17, in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, and then pitched the ball to Antwaan Randle El on an option run for the two-point conversion to make it 28–25. Taking over at his own 13 with 1:59 left and down 31–25, Roethlisberger was unable to lead the game-winning drive against Green Bay this time after his pass fell incomplete to Wallace on 4th and 5 at his own 33-yard line, ensuring the only Super Bowl loss of his career. Roethlisberger finished the 31–25 loss 25 of 40 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. &quot;I feel like I let the city of Pittsburgh down, the fans, my coaches and my teammates,&quot; Roethlisberger said, &quot;and it&#x27;s not a good feeling.&quot; In the off-season, he was ranked 41st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

===2011===
In Week 1 against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger set career-worsts for turnovers (5) and largest margin of defeat (28) in his first loss against the Ravens since 2006. In Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, he became the fourth quarterback to reach 70 wins in his first 100 starts, as he threw for 298 yards and did not turn the ball over. He took a shot to his right knee in the second quarter, but returned after missing two plays to finish the game.

In a 23–20 Week 3 win against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger threw for a career-high 171 yards in the first quarter, turned the ball over three times in the second quarter, then led the Steelers to the 20th fourth quarter comeback of his career, passing Terry Bradshaw for the most in Steelers&#x27; history. In Week 5 against the Tennessee Titans, Roethlisberger threw five touchdown passes for the second time in his career. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for the seventh time in his career. In Week 7 against the Arizona Cardinals, Roethlisberger set the franchise record for longest pass with a 95-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace. He finished with 361 yards and 3 touchdowns in his first regular season win over the Cardinals. Roethlisberger beat the Tom Brady-led Patriots for the first time in seven years in Week 8, completing 36 of 50 passes for 365 yards and 2 touchdowns. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the eighth time in his career. In Week 12 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roethlisberger&#x27;s career-best streak of 18 consecutive games with 200+ yards passing came to an end as he finished with 193. In Week 13 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Roethlisberger moved past Terry Bradshaw in the Steelers&#x27; record books; first for most times sacked, then for most pass completions in team history.

In the second quarter of the Week 14 game against the Cleveland Browns, Roethlisberger&#x27;s leg was injured on a sack and he left the game. He returned for the second half and played the rest of the game, despite limping on his high-ankle sprain. He threw a game-clinching 79-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown late in the fourth quarter as the Steelers won 14–3. Roethlisberger finished with 280 yards passing on just 21 attempts for a career-high 13.33 YPA (min. 15 attempts). On the injury, Roethlisberger said, &quot;It was one of the most painful things I ever felt. It felt like the middle of my leg was just, cracked ... it felt like my foot was outside of my leg.&quot; In Week 15 against the San Francisco 49ers, Roethlisberger started the game while suffering through a high-ankle sprain. During the game, it was clear that Roethlisberger was still showing signs of the injury due to him limping between plays. He finished the game without any touchdowns but had 330 yards passing while throwing three interceptions.

Because of Roethlisberger&#x27;s leg injury from Week 14, the team opted to sit him and start Charlie Batch in the Week 16 game against the St. Louis Rams, giving Roethlisberger more time to recover.

In Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, just three weeks after the Browns injured Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger once again took the field to face the same opponents in their home stadium. The Steelers opted to start Roethlisberger over Batch because of the possibility that Baltimore could drop its final game, and a win by the Steelers would take back the division title. Despite his injury, Mike Tomlin and the coaching staff believed Roethlisberger gave them their best chance at victory. Big Ben completed 23 of 40 passes for 221 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Baltimore went on to win their final game and secured the division title, leaving Steelers with the number 5 seed to face Denver in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.

In the Wild Card Round against the Denver Broncos, Roethlisberger and the Steelers offense battled a tough Denver defense, trailing 20–6 at the half but tying it at 23–23 before the end of regulation. The game-tying touchdown came on a 2nd and 10 with 3:47 remaining in regulation, in which Big Ben made a vintage play eluding pass rushers before connecting with Jerricho Cotchery on a 31-yard pass. Despite the heroic efforts of Roethlisberger and company, Tim Tebow&#x27;s magical season continued with his best single-game performance to date, capped off with an 80-yard completion to Demaryius Thomas to end overtime after one play. Roethlisberger completed 22 of 40 passes for 289 yards, with 1 touchdown and 1 interception in the 29–23 overtime loss to end the 2011 season. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2011 season. He finished ranked 30th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.

===2012===
Roethlisberger threw for 3,265 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions in thirteen games as the Steelers finished the 2012 season with an 8–8 record. One of his best individual games in the 2012 season came against the Oakland Raiders in Week 3. He had 384 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 34–31 loss. He missed three games due to injury, being replaced by Byron Leftwich, who went 0–1, and Charlie Batch, who went 1–1. It was the Steelers first season missing the playoffs since 2009 and their first with a non-winning record since 2006. He finished ranked 61st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.

In 2012, Roethlisberger returned to Miami University to complete his college degree, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Education on May 6, 2012. Roethlisberger walked with the other graduates at the commencement ceremony, with his parents, grandmother, and wife Ashley in attendance. He had planned on finishing his degree sooner, but the Steelers having deep playoff runs earlier in his career prevented him from registering for classes in time for the winter term, only being able to do it after the Steelers were eliminated in the Wild Card round against the Denver Broncos the previous season. Roethlisberger became the second member of the Steelers in less than a year to return to college and complete his degree, with teammate Polamalu doing the same thing the previous off-season during the 2011 NFL lockout.

===2013: Killer B&#x27;s era===
Roethlisberger threw for 4,261 yards and 28 touchdowns in 16 games in 2013 as the Steelers finished the season with an 8–8 record. In Week 11, in a 37–27 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had 367 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. The Steelers would go on to miss the playoffs after the San Diego Chargers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime in Week 17. This would also be the first time they missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons since 1999 and the first time under Mike Tomlin. Roethlisberger was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.

This season was particularly notable for Roethlisberger as it marked the beginning of the Killer B&#x27;s era. Roethlisberger, along with wide receiver Antonio Brown, running back Le&#x27;veon Bell and, later, kicker Chris Boswell all entered their primes. Roethlisberger finished the season seventh in passing yards, eighth in touchdowns, 10th in completion percentage and his 92.0 passer rating ranked 12th in the league for the 2013 season. Roethlisberger targeted Brown in particular 165 times, resulting in 110 receptions for 1,499 yards and 8 touchdowns. This accounted for approximately 28% of Roethlisberger&#x27;s 584 pass attempts that season. Even though he was not a receiver and mainly fulfilled the role of being a &quot;power back&quot; in the Steelers&#x27; offense, Roethlisberger targeted Bell 66 times, resulting in 45 receptions for 399 yards but recording no receiving touchdowns.

===2014===

Roesthilsberger started the 2014 season with a 4–3 record in the first seven games. On October 26, 2014, against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger completed 40 of 49 passes for a career-high 522 yards and six touchdowns as the Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 51–34. With the win, Roethlisberger became just the fourth quarterback in NFL history to get 100 wins in his first 150 starts. He also became the first NFL quarterback to pass for over 500 yards twice in a career. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Colts. In the next game, a 43–23 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, he had 340 passing yards and six passing touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second consecutive week.
In the Steelers Week 15 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Roethlisberger completed 27 of 35 passes for 360 yards in a 27–20 victory. The victory made Roethlisberger only the sixth quarterback in NFL history to have defeated at least 31 different teams, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Kerry Collins, Brett Favre, and Peyton Manning; Roethlisberger has only played with one team and thus has not played against the Steelers. The Steelers lost 41–38 in Roethlisberger&#x27;s only other matchup against Atlanta in 2006, and he was suspended for the Steelers 15–9 overtime victory against the Falcons in 2010.

During 2014, Roethlisberger passed for career highs in yards with 4,952, completion percentage with 67.1, completions with 408, and attempts with 608. Roethlisberger also matched his career high in passing touchdowns with 32, as well as posting a passer rating of 103.3, the second highest of his career. His 4,952 yards were tied for most on the season with Drew Brees, but Roethlisberger reached the mark with fewer completions.

The Steelers had an 11–5 record and finished first in the AFC North. They lost in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 30–17. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl for the 2014 season. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.

===2015===

Roethlisberger went 26 for 38 for 351 yards, one touchdown pass and one interception during a 28–21 loss against the New England Patriots to kick off the 2015 NFL season. However, Roethlisberger and the Steelers won their next two games against the San Francisco 49ers and the St. Louis Rams. In the 43–18 victory over the 49ers, he had 369 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

During the September 27 game against the St. Louis Rams, Roethlisberger suffered a sprained MCL and a bone bruise. Roethlisberger missed the Steelers&#x27; next four games, during which Michael Vick and Landry Jones combined to go 2–2.

Roethlisberger sustained another injury against the Oakland Raiders on November 8, 2015, suffering a left mid-foot sprain. Due to this injury, he did not start the following week against the Cleveland Browns, although he was listed as active for the game. However, early in the first quarter, Landry Jones sprained his left ankle, resulting in Roethlisberger entering the game in relief for only the second time in his career. Roethlisberger threw for 379 yards and three touchdowns on the way to a Steelers win and an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award; his 379 passing yards were the most by a quarterback in relief since Don Strock threw for 403 yards for the Miami Dolphins against the San Diego Chargers in the Epic in Miami playoff game in 1982. On November 29, Roethlisberger threw for 456 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, but he also threw two interceptions, and the Seahawks took a 39–30 win.

The Steelers clinched a playoff spot with a 10–6 record, finishing second in the AFC North behind the Cincinnati Bengals. They defeated the Bengals by a score of 18–16 in the Wild Card Round, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round by a score of 23–16.

===2016===

Roethlisberger started off the 2016 season with a 2–1 record in the first three games. He had back-to-back 300-yard passing performances against the Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets in Weeks 4–5, and combined for nine touchdowns in that span. For his effort against the Chiefs, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week. However, the following week on the road against the Miami Dolphins, Roethlisberger left the game after suffering a knee injury. He underwent surgery on October 17 for a torn meniscus and missed the following week against the New England Patriots. The Steelers made the playoffs, winning the AFC North with an 11–5 record. They defeated the Miami Dolphins by a score of 30–12 in the Wild Card Round and beat the Chiefs 18–16 in the Divisional Round. However, the Steelers lost 36–17 to the Patriots in the AFC Championship. He passed for 314 passing yards, one passing touchdown, and one interception.

Roethlisberger was named to his third consecutive and fifth career Pro Bowl on December 20, 2016, and was ranked 22nd on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017, just one spot below his ranking from the previous year.

===2017===

Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to a 3–1 record to start to the 2017 season. In Week 5 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Roethlisberger threw a career-high five interceptions as the Steelers lost by a score of 30–9. In Week 11 against the Tennessee Titans, he completed 30 of 45 passes for 299 yards and four touchdowns as the Steelers won 40–17.

With the win, the Steelers clinched a playoff berth and the AFC North title. His 44 completions set an NFL record for the most completions in a non-overtime game and were the second most in NFL history behind Drew Bledsoe&#x27;s 45 completions in 1994. His performance in Week 14 earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week.

During Week 15 against the New England Patriots, Roethlisberger finished with 281 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. In the closing seconds of the fourth quarter, two controversial moments occurred; Roethlisberger threw a potential game-winning touchdown to tight end Jesse James, but was overturned after James seemingly lost control when the ball touched the ground. Two plays later, Roethlisberger faked a spike to pass, which was intercepted by Duron Harmon, resulting in the Steelers losing 24–27.

On December 19, 2017, Roethlisberger was named to his fourth consecutive and sixth career Pro Bowl along with his star receiver Antonio Brown and three of his starting offensive lineman among others.

The Steelers finished the 2017 season with a 13–3 record, clinching the AFC North division. In the AFC Divisional Round, the Steelers faced the Jaguars.

In Week 10 against the Carolina Panthers, Roethlisberger had more touchdowns than incompletions on a statline of 22-of-25 for 328 yards and five touchdowns in his NFL-record fourth game with a perfect quarterback rating. His performance in Week 10 earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time in 2018.

Subsequently, the team announced the following day that Roethlisberger would be placed on the season ending injured-reserve list after undergoing surgery on his injured elbow. After the season, it was revealed that Roethlisberger&#x27;s injury was much more serious than originally anticipated, as he tore off three flexor tendons from his throwing arm, and he is believed to be the first quarterback to attempt a comeback from such an injury.

===2020===
Roethlisberger made his return from injury in the Week 1 game against the New York Giants, where he threw for 229 yards and three touchdowns in the 26–16 win. In Week 3 against the Houston Texans, Roethlisberger threw for 237 yards and two touchdowns during the 28–21 win. During the game, Roethlisberger broke Mike Webster&#x27;s record for the most games played with the Steelers with 221 games.

On November 10, 2020, Roethlisberger was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 after being deemed high risk due to Vance McDonald contracting COVID-19 but was activated four days later. In Week 10, against the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 333 passing yards and four passing touchdowns in the 36–10 victory. Roethlisberger was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.

===2021===
Roethlisberger signed a renegotiated contract with the Steelers on March 4, 2021, that saw him take a $5 million pay cut. Roethlisberger began his final season with a Week 1 victory over the Buffalo Bills. He scored his first touchdown of the season with a five yard pass to Diontae Johnson. It would be his only score of the game as he completed 18-of-32 passes for 188 yards and not committing any turnovers. Despite losing 24-10 to division rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals, Roethlisberger threw for a season high 318 yards, completed 38-of-58 pass attempts and threw one touchdown pass against two interceptions. During October 10&#x27;s 27-19 win over the Denver Broncos, Roethlisberger had his first multiple touchdown game of the year, opening the game with a 50 yard touchdown pass to Johnson and an 18 yard pass to Chase Claypool. This kickstarted a four game win streak for the Steelers. Across those four games, Roethlisberger threw for six touchdowns, committed no turnovers and completed 67% (87-of-129) of his passes for 953 yards. The Steelers&#x27; streak was halted when, a day before the Week 10 game against the Detroit Lions, the Steelers placed Roethlisberger on Reserve/COVID-19 list after testing positive for the virus. He returned for November 21&#x27;s 41-37 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in which he threw for 273 yards and three touchdowns.

In his final home game, Roethlisberger threw for 123 yards, a touchdown and an interception, leading the team to a 26-14 victory over the Cleveland Browns and eliminating them from playoff contention. With his helmet still on, in full uniform, Roethlisberger gave an emotional interview after the game and was the last player to leave the field. This win officially cemented Roethlisberger with 164 career wins as a starter, which was the fifth-most in NFL history at the time and ending his record at Heinz Field with a win-loss record of 92-31, the fourth most home victories a quarterback has ever had with a single team in NFL history. 
Roethlisberger finished the 2021 regular season with 3,740 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and ten interceptions, and also had an additional rushing touchdown as the Steelers finished with a 9–7–1 record, earning a spot in the Wild card round as the seven seed.

===Retirement===
On January 27, 2022, Roethlisberger announced his retirement from the NFL.

After Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady unretired in March of that year, some wondered if Roethlisberger would also come back for another season. Roethlisberger was quick to silence those questions when he told WDVE in Pittsburgh, &quot;First off, my coach and GM don&#x27;t want me back. Second off, I&#x27;m pretty content with where I&#x27;m at.&quot; In March 2023, Roethlisberger revealed to Mark Madden however that the San Francisco 49ers did show some interest after suffering injuries with Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo left Brock Purdy as the starting quarterback, but Roethlisberger declined.

====&quot;Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger&quot;====
On September 2, 2022, Roethlisberger began the podcast &quot;Footbahlin with Ben Roethlisberger&quot; on his Channel 7 YouTube channel. Co-hosted by Pittsburgh-based musician and producer Spencer Te&#x27;o, Roethlisberger and Te&#x27;o started the first several episodes mainly discussing Roethlisberger&#x27;s life after retirement, stories from his tenure with the Steelers and beer tasting. The show eventually evolved into having guest interviews with current and former players and coaches such as Kenny Pickett, Jerome Bettis, Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin. During the 2023 season, the show began to incorporate Roethlisberger and Te&#x27;o watching various Steeler games and providing commentary.

The final episode was uploaded on December 25, 2023, with an episode about the Steelers&#x27; victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Christmas Eve. In an interview with WDVE in 2024, Roethlisberger claimed that the podcast would not continue. Despite this announcement, Roethlisberger uploaded a surprise teaser for another season of the podcast on August 29, 2024, to begin the following week.

==Charitable works==
Roethlisberger started a foundation with the following mission statement: &quot;The Ben Roethlisberger Foundation seeks to (a): provide support for police and fire departments throughout the United States with a particular emphasis on service dogs and (b): to enhance the quality of life for residents of Findlay, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&quot;

In 2005, Roethlisberger donated one game check to aid the tsunami relief fund. He has also donated over $100,000 to fund police dogs in Pittsburgh.

In October 2014, Roethlisberger and his wife donated $1 million to his alma mater, Miami University, for an indoor sports center.

==Personal life==

Roethlisberger was born in Lima, Ohio, the son of Ida Jane (née Foust) and Kenneth Todd &quot;Ken&quot; Roethlisberger. His father is a former pitcher and quarterback at Georgia Tech. He is of part Swiss descent; his surname, Roethlisberger (Swiss-German spelling: &quot;Röthlisberger&quot;), is of Swiss origin, with roots in Geissbühl, a farming hamlet in the municipality of Lauperswil, Switzerland. His younger sister, Carlee Roethlisberger, played basketball for the University of Oklahoma.

On July 23, 2011, Roethlisberger married Ashley Harlan, a physician assistant from New Castle, Pennsylvania. He and his wife have three children, Ben Jr., Baylee, and Bodie.

Roethlisberger is a Christian. Roethlisberger grew up as a Christian but recommitted to his faith in 2017. Roethlisberger has said &quot;Go ahead and be the best athlete you can possibly be, and see if you can be a better Christian. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do now. I&#x27;m trying to be a better Christian than I am athlete and football player.&quot;

Roethlisberger is a spokesman for Swiss Roots, a campaign intended to help Americans of Swiss origin reconnect with their Swiss ancestral heritage. In May 2006, Roethlisberger and his family traveled to Switzerland for a week.

He has his own line of barbecue sauce, Big Ben&#x27;s BBQ, and is an investor in tech startups, including neonatal care company, NeoLight.

==Controversy==

===Motorcycle accident===
On June 12, 2006, Roethlisberger was in a motorcycle accident near downtown Pittsburgh, in which he was not wearing his helmet. Roethlisberger did not have a valid Pennsylvania motorcycle license at the time of the accident, only a temporary permit that he had obtained after moving to Pittsburgh that had expired in March.

Roethlisberger was traveling east on Second Avenue when a 1996 Chrysler New Yorker made a left turn in front of the motorcycle on the South Tenth Street Bridge when the accident occurred. According to an eyewitness, Roethlisberger went over the handlebars of his bike, shattering the windshield of the car with his head. Reports from the scene and news media indicated that the accident was serious but &quot;not life- or career-threatening,&quot; though Roethlisberger related in interviews that paramedics on the scene stopped bleeding in his throat just in time to save his life. Roethlisberger was transported to Mercy Hospital and was described as being in &quot;serious but stable&quot; condition in the operating room.

Police sources indicated that Roethlisberger suffered fractures to the jaw and right sinus cavity, as well as a nine-inch laceration to the back of the head, the loss of two teeth, and several chipped teeth.

At Mercy Hospital, he went immediately into surgery to repair the broken bones in his face. A subsequent news conference with the hospital staff was brief but confirmed early reports that the most serious injuries were to the head and face. After surgery on June 13, 2006, Roethlisberger was upgraded to fair condition.

The most serious injuries to Roethlisberger were a broken upper and lower jaw and a broken nose.

Roethlisberger was released from the hospital on June 14, 2006. The next day, he released a statement apologizing for concerning friends, family, all his fans, and the Steelers organization, and in which he also stated, &quot;If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet.&quot; Roethlisberger was subsequently videotaped by KDKA-TV staff riding without a helmet on a Pittsburgh freeway.

On June 19, the Pittsburgh police announced that Roethlisberger was to be cited for failure to wear a helmet and failure to operate in his license class. Wearing a helmet is optional in Pennsylvania only for operators who possess and have had a motorcycle license for at least two years. The driver of the car was cited for failure to yield the right of way.

Roethlisberger gave his first television interview after the accident on July 13, with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Despite the seriousness of the accident, his recovery went so well that he started the first three Steelers preseason games in 2006.

===Sexual assault allegations===

====Lake Tahoe====
In July 2009, Andrea McNulty, 31, filed a civil claim in Washoe County, Nevada District Court accusing Roethlisberger of sexual assault in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in Stateline, Nevada for a celebrity golf tournament. Roethlisberger was one of nine defendants listed in the docket report and Roethlisberger&#x27;s attorney denied the claim.

The Lake Tahoe suit sought damages from the quarterback and additional damages from Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe officials, alleging that they covered up the incident. According to McNulty, she was working as an executive casino host in July 2008 when she said Roethlisberger struck up a friendly conversation at her desk during the tournament. The next night she claimed Roethlisberger telephoned her to tell her that the television sound system in his room was not working and asked her to look at it. McNulty said she determined that the TV was functioning properly, but as she turned to leave, he stood in front of the door and blocked her, then grabbed her and started to kiss her. According to the lawsuit, the woman obtained hospital treatment after the incident. A second lawsuit filed by a Harrah&#x27;s employee related to an incident involving Roethlisberger four days earlier showed that Roethlisberger was friends with a Harrah&#x27;s executive overseeing northern Nevada. McNulty&#x27;s suit alleges that her boss told her &quot;That guy [Roethlisberger] can have anyone he wants.&quot;

In August 2009, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; published details of an affidavit filed as part of a motion by two of the other defendants named in the suit to relocate the case from Washoe County to Douglas County. In the affidavit, Angela Antonetti, McNulty&#x27;s former co-worker, delivered a sworn statement that McNulty had bragged to her about having consensual sex with Roethlisberger. As part of the affidavit, Antonetti said she was &quot;absolutely shocked&quot; upon hearing of the case on the radio on July 21. Antonetti explained, &quot;I knew that [her] lawsuit and false allegations would unfairly and unjustly hurt Mr. Roethlisberger&quot;.

According to the affidavit, defendant Antonetti claimed that McNulty had revealed she was hoping she had gotten pregnant with a &quot;little Roethlisberger&quot;. Antonetti also claimed that she had been asked to travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in August 2008 in an attempt to &quot;run into&quot; the quarterback. In response, Antonetti advised McNulty she &quot;shouldn&#x27;t try to chase Mr. Roethlisberger&quot;.

In December 2011, the suit was ended when the parties settled.

====Milledgeville, Georgia====
On March 5, 2010, it was revealed that police in Milledgeville, Georgia investigated Roethlisberger for assault inside the women&#x27;s restroom of the Capital City nightclub. The accuser, a then-20-year-old student at nearby Georgia College &amp; State University, was seen at several establishments with Roethlisberger leading up to the incident, including posing for a photograph with him. Roethlisberger spoke with police the night of the incident and stated that he did have contact with the woman that was not &quot;consummated&quot; and afterward the accuser slipped and injured herself.

Roethlisberger hired lawyer Ed Garland, who previously defended Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis in his murder trial. Head coach Mike Tomlin stated at the time that he was &quot;highly concerned&quot; for the franchise and Roethlisberger.

The accuser was treated at Oconee Regional Medical Center. An emergency-room doctor and two nurses examined her and noted in their report a &quot;superficial laceration and bruising and slight bleeding in the genital area&quot;, but could not say if trauma or assault was the cause. The remaining examination was &quot;normal&quot;. A rape kit was collected, but no semen was recovered. The doctor&#x27;s report also quoted the alleged victim telling them that, &quot;A boy kind of raped me.&quot;

In interviews with the police on the night of the incident, the woman alleged that Roethlisberger, after inviting her and her friends to the V.I.P. area of the nightclub, encouraged them to take shots of alcohol before Anthony Barravecchio – an off-duty Coraopolis, Pennsylvania policeman, undercover DEA narcotics officer at Pittsburgh International Airport, and one of Roethlisberger&#x27;s bodyguards – claimed he led her down a hallway and left. Witnesses, however, stated that Barravecchio &quot;placed his hand&quot; on the accuser&#x27;s shoulder and applied &quot;a little bit of pressure to guide her&quot; to the restroom where she claims the assault took place, something Barravecchio&#x27;s lawyer denied.

After Barravecchio&#x27;s purported departure, Roethlisberger allegedly approached, exposed himself, and despite the woman&#x27;s protests, followed her into what turned out to be a bathroom when she tried to leave through the first door she saw. The woman claims Roethlisberger raped her and further alleged that friends of the woman attempted to intervene out of worry, but the second of Roethlisberger&#x27;s bodyguards, Edward Joyner—an off-duty Pennsylvania State Trooper—avoided eye contact and said he did not know what they were talking about. The policemen claimed to &quot;have no memory&quot; of meeting the woman.

Milledgeville Police Sergeant Jerry Blash, who had posed for a photograph with Roethlisberger earlier in the evening, was the first officer to respond. Blash later admitted denigrating the accuser and never formally questioning Roethlisberger; he did speak to the NFL player and his off-duty police bodyguards at the Capital City club.

In April 2010, district attorney Fred Bright announced that Roethlisberger would not be charged. Further, the accuser wrote to the D.A. through her lawyer expressing she no longer wanted to pursue criminal charges because the level of media attention would make a criminal trial too &quot;intrusive&quot; of a personal experience but stressed that she was not recanting her accusation.

As a result of the unabridged details revealed in Bright&#x27;s press conference Steelers president Art Rooney II was reported to be &quot;furious&quot;. The owner of Pittsburgh-based PLB Sports, which marketed &quot;Big Ben&#x27;s Beef Jerky&quot;, terminated the company&#x27;s five-year sponsorship of Roethlisberger, the first such action in the company&#x27;s 14-year history. Jerry Blash resigned from the Milledgeville Police on April 15, 2010. Anthony Barravecchio was never disciplined, despite a local investigation where the Coraopolis Solicitor reviewed the 500-page Georgia Bureau of Investigation file on the matter; however, Barravecchio&#x27;s interview with the GBI was not among those released by the agency. Ed Joyner was prohibited by the Pennsylvania State Troopers from continuing to work for Roethlisberger, and lost a grievance case seeking to overturn the decision.

===2010 suspension===
Roethlisberger was suspended for six games during the 2010 NFL season for violating the league&#x27;s personal conduct policy, and was ordered to undergo a league-mandated &quot;professional behavior evaluation&quot; and &quot;must adhere to any counseling or treatment that is recommended by the professional evaluators.&quot; The suspension was subsequently reduced to four games.

==In popular culture==
Roethlisberger is the namesake of multiple sandwiches, which are usually named using a pun on his last name&#x27;s similarity to &quot;burger&quot; or &quot;hamburger&quot;. For instance, the Pittsburgh restaurant chain Peppi&#x27;s sells the &quot;Roethlisburger&quot;, at a price of $7.00, in correlation with his jersey number &quot;7&quot;, and also having ingredients that describe his playing style (scrambled eggs for &quot;scrambler&quot;, beef and sausage for his size and strength). A Findlay, Ohio, restaurant named Tony&#x27;s and an Oxford, Ohio, restaurant named Brick Street also sell &quot;Roethlisburger&quot; sandwiches.

He has appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; after both of his Super Bowl victories. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, one week after Pittsburgh won Super Bowl XL, Roethlisberger introduced Kelly Clarkson. In 2009, he hosted &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. He, along with other Steelers players, made a cameo appearance as a member of the Gotham Rogues football team in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;.

Roethlisberger would also be mentioned or parodied in works in which he had no involvement. This would include an episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot; in which Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller) purchases a Roethlisberger jersey while in a layover at Pittsburgh International Airport, an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; that parodies the aforementioned sexual assault charges, and an infamous scene in the movie &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; (both filmed and set in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monroeville, Pennsylvania) where a drunken Steelers fan asks two characters in the middle of a sex scene and fully nude (oblivious to the situation due to his Yinzer-esque high intoxication) if they watched the game and that Roethlisberger was screaming &quot;huck it, chuck it, football!&quot;.

<text>A comprehensive school is a secondary school for pupils aged 11–16 or 11–18, that does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, in contrast to a selective school system where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria, usually academic performance. The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced as state schools on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965.

About 90% of English secondary school pupils attend such schools (academy schools, community schools, faith schools, foundation schools, free schools, studio schools, university technical colleges, state boarding schools, City Technology Colleges, etc). Specialist schools may however select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in their specialism. A school may have a few specialisms, like arts (media, performing arts, visual arts), business and enterprise, engineering, humanities, languages, mathematics, computing, music, science, sports, and technology. They are not permitted to select on academic ability generally.

They may be part of a local education authority or be a self governing academy or part of a multi-academy trust. Comprehensive schools correspond broadly to the public school in the United States, Canada and Australia.

===Description===
Comprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11–16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and specialist schools programmes have expanded the comprehensive model. City Technology Colleges are independent schools in urban areas that are free to go to. They&#x27;re funded by central government with company contributions and emphasise teaching science and technology.

English secondary schools are mostly comprehensive (i.e. no entry exam), although the intake of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially in urban areas with several local schools. Nearly 90% of state-funded secondary schools are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects (performing arts, business, humanities, art and design, languages, science, mathematics, technology, engineering, sports, etc.) in which the school specialises, which can select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism. In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school&#x27;s specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests.

Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 and 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of Key Stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another. In principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as &quot;neighbourhood&quot; schools for all students in a specified catchment area.

Maths free schools like Exeter Mathematics School are for 16 to 19 year old pupils who have a great aptitude for maths. As set out in the government&#x27;s Industrial Strategy, maths schools help to encourage highly skilled graduates in sectors that depend on science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills. The aim of maths schools is to prepare the most mathematically able pupils to succeed in mathematics-related disciplines at university and pursue mathematically intensive careers. Maths schools can also be centres of excellence in raising attainment, supporting and influencing the teaching of mathematics in their surrounding area, and are central to their associated universities&#x27; widening participation commitments.

Technical and vocational education in comprehensive schools may be introduced during the secondary school years and this may later progress into further and higher education. Further education incorporates a combination of vocational oriented education and general secondary education. Students may also opt to enroll at a sixth form college or further education college to prepare themselves for a wide curriculum or apprenticeships, study, and national vocational awards. Major provider of vocational qualifications in England include the Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC), City and Guilds of London Institute, National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), and Edexcel.

===History===
The first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. In 1946 Walworth School was an &#x27;experimental&#x27; comprehensive school set up by the London County Council, although London&#x27;s first purpose built comprehensive was Kidbrooke School built in 1954. Also in 1946 the Windermere Grammar School though retaining the name became a (boys&#x27;) comprehensive. On the Isle of Man, (a Crown dependency and not part of the United Kingdom) comprehensive education was also introduced in 1946. Mellow Lane School a co-educational comprehensive school was established in 1948 in Hayes then part of the former county of Middlesex. In Wales the first comprehensive school was Holyhead County School in Anglesey in 1949. Coventry opened two comprehensive schools in 1954 by combining grammar schools and secondary modern schools. These were Caludon Castle School and Woodlands School. Mount Grace School, Potters Bar which opened in 1954 was purpose-built as a comprehensive. Another early example was the 1956 Tividale Comprehensive School in Tipton. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was Colne Valley High School near Huddersfield in 1956. These early comprehensives mostly modelled themselves, in terms of ethos, on the grammar school, with gown-wearing teachers conducting lessons in a very formal style. The opening of Risinghill School in Islington in 1960 offered an alternative to this model. Embracing the progressive ideals of 1960s education, such schools typically abandoned corporal punishment and brought in a more liberal attitude to discipline and methods of study.
The largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by Anthony Crosland, Secretary of State for Education in the 1964–1970 Labour government. The policy decision was implemented by Circular 10/65, a request to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern, secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places.

In 1970, Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary of State for Education in the new Conservative government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert. However, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary. By 1975, the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period, many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s, the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. 

In 1976, the future Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the &#x27;great debate&#x27; on the education system. He went on to list the areas he believed needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspections, and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive schools remain the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region.

Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose to which school their child should go, or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of &quot;school choice&quot; introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original &quot;neighbourhood comprehensive&quot; model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting &#x27;specialisation&#x27; whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child&#x27;s interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a quasi-market incentive to encourage better schools. Both Conservative and Labour governments experimented with alternatives to the original neighbourhood comprehensive.

Experiments have included:
* Partnerships where successful schools share knowledge and best practice with nearby schools
* Federations of schools, where a partnership is formalised through joint governance arrangements
* City Technology Colleges, 15 new schools where one fifth of the capital cost is privately funded
* Academy schools, state schools not controlled by the local authority, which are allowed to select up to 10% of admissions by ability
* Free schools, state schools not controlled by the local authority, which are allowed to select up to 10% of admissions by ability
Following the advice of Cyril Taylor, former businessman, Conservative politician, and chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT), in the mid-1990s, all parties have backed the creation of specialist schools, which focus on excellence in a particular subject and are theoretically allowed to select up to 10% of their intake. This policy consensus had brought to an end the notion that all children will go to their local school, and assumes parents will choose a school they feel most meets their child&#x27;s needs.

=== Curriculum ===
All maintained schools in England are required to follow the National Curriculum, which is made up of twelve subjects. Every state school must offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, and prepares pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life. For each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at the relevant Key Stages. Teachers should set high expectations for every pupil. They should plan stretching work for pupils whose attainment is significantly above the expected standard. Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious.

Under the National Curriculum, all pupils undergo National Curriculum assessments at the end of Key Stage 2 in Year 6 in the core subjects of English, mathematics and science. Individual teacher assessments are used for foundation subjects, such as art and design, geography, history, design and technology, and computing. Pupils take GCSE exams at Key Stage 4 in Year 11, but may also choose to work towards the attainment of alternative qualifications, such as the National Vocational Qualifications and Business and Technology Education Council. Pupils take GCSEs examinations in the core English literature, English language, mathematics, science, and entitlement subjects from the arts, humanities, design and technology, and languages. The core subjects English, Mathematics and Science are compulsory for all pupils aged 5 to 16. A range of other subjects, known as foundation subjects, are compulsory in each Key Stage:
* Art and design
* Citizenship
* Design and technology
* Geography
* History
* Computing
* Foreign languages
* Music
* Physical education

In addition to the compulsory subjects, pupils at Key Stage 4 have a statutory entitlement to study at least one subject from the arts (comprising art and design, music, photography, dance, drama and media arts), design and technology (comprising design and technology, electronics, engineering, food preparation and nutrition), the humanities (comprising geography and history), and modern foreign languages. Optional subjects include computer science, business studies, economics, astronomy, classical civilisation, film studies, geology, psychology, sociology, ancient languages, and ancient history.

The Department for Education has drawn up a list of preferred subjects known as the English Baccalaureate on the results in eight GCSEs including English, mathematics, the sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science), history, geography, and an ancient or modern foreign language.

All schools are required to make provision for a daily act of collective worship and must teach religious education to pupils at every key stage and sex and relationships education to pupils in secondary education. Parents can withdraw their children for all or part of the lessons. Local councils are responsible for deciding the RE syllabus, but faith schools and academies can set their own. All schools should make provision for personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE). Schools are also free to include other subjects or topics of their choice in planning and designing their own programme of education.

=== School years ===
Children are normally placed in year groups determined by the age they will attain at their birthday during the school year. In most cases progression from one year group to another is based purely on chronological age, although it is possible in some circumstances for a student to repeat or skip a year. Repetition may be due to a lack of attendance, for example due to a long illness, and especially in Years requiring standard tests. A child significantly more advanced than their classmates may be forwarded one or more years.

State-funded nursery education is available from the age of 3, and may be full-time or part-time, though this is not compulsory. If registered with a state school, attendance is compulsory beginning with the term following the child&#x27;s fifth birthday. Children can be enrolled in the reception year in September of that school year, thus beginning school at age 4 or 4.5. Unless the student chooses to stay within the education system, compulsory school attendance ends on the last Friday in June during the academic year in which a student attains the age of 16.

In the vast majority of cases, pupils progress from primary to secondary levels at age 11; in some areas either or both of the primary and secondary levels are further subdivided. A few areas have three-tier education systems with an intermediate middle level from age 9 to 13. Years 12 and 13 are often referred to as &quot;lower sixth form&quot; and &quot;upper sixth form&quot; respectively, reflecting their distinct, voluntary nature as the A-level years. While most secondary schools enter their pupils for A-levels, some schools offer the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge Pre-U qualifications instead.
== Scotland ==
Scotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The Scottish Government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005.

== Australia ==

When the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the Australian Government started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students&#x27; academic merit based on their performance in public examinations. The state of Western Australia was the first to replace selective school systems, then Queensland, and finally South Australia and Victoria.

The Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12. Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level. The Year-level follows specific sequence content and achievement for each subject, which can be interrelated through cross-curricula. In order for students to complete and graduate each tier-level of schooling, they need to complete the subject sequences of content and achievement. Once students have completed Year 12, they may choose to enter into Tertiary education. The two-tier Tertiary education system in Australia includes both higher education (i.e.: university, college, other institutions) and vocational education and training (VET). Higher education works off of the Australian Qualifications Framework and prepares Australians for an academic route that may take them into the theoretical and philosophical lenses of their career options.

<doc id="699352" wikidata="Q3243690" url="?curid=699352" title="Chief Justice of India">
<text>The chief justice of India (CJI) (ISO: ) is the chief judge of the Supreme Court of India and the highest-ranking officer of the Indian judiciary. The Constitution of India grants power to the President of India to appoint, as recommended by the outgoing chief justice in consultation with other judges, (as envisaged in Article 124 (2) of the Constitution) the next chief justice, who will serve until they reach the age of 65 or are removed by the constitutional process of impeachment.

As per convention, the successor suggested by the incumbent chief justice is most often the next most senior judge of the Supreme Court. However, this convention has been broken twice. In 1973, Justice A. N. Ray was appointed, superseding three senior judges, and in 1977 when Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as Chief Justice, superseding Justice Hans Raj Khanna.

As head of the Supreme Court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation of cases and appointment of constitutional benches that deal with important matters of law. In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India and the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the chief justice has to allocate work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to them (for re-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by another group of experienced judges.

On the administrative side, the chief justice carries out functions of maintenance of the roster, appointment of court officials, and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the supervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. The chief justice is de facto chancellor of National Law School of India University and Visitor of National Law University, Delhi.

The 51st and present chief justice is Sanjiv Khanna. He was sworn in as Chief Justice on 11 November 2024.

==Appointment==
As the incumbent chief justice approaches retirement, the Ministry of Law and Justice seeks a recommendation from the incumbent chief justice. Consultations with other judges might also take place. The recommendation is then presented to the prime minister, who will advice the president in the matter of appointment.

== Removal ==
Article 124(4) of the Constitution of India lays down the procedure for the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court, which is applicable to chief justices as well. Once appointed, the chief justice remains in office until age 65. There is no fixed tenure provided in the constitution. He can be removed only through a process of removal by Parliament as follows:
==Acting president==
The &quot;President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969&quot; specifies the chief justice of India shall act as the president of India in the event of the offices of both the president and the vice president being vacant. When President Zakir Hussain died in office, Vice President V. V. Giri acted as the president. Later, V V Giri resigned as the vice president, the chief justice, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah became the acting president of India. As per the convention, the senior most judge of the Supreme Court become the acting chief justice. When the newly elected president took office a month later, Justice Hidayatullah reverted as the chief justice of India.

==Remuneration==
The Constitution of India gives the power of deciding remuneration as well as other conditions of service of the chief justice to the Parliament of India. Accordingly, such provisions have been laid down in &quot;The Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958&quot;. This remuneration was revised in 2006–2008 after the Sixth Central Pay Commission&#x27;s recommendation. According to the Seventh pay commission, in 2016, the salary was revised.

<doc id="699357" wikidata="Q337036" url="?curid=699357" title="Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton">
<text>Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton (May 160119 March 1643), styled Lord Compton from 1618 to 1630, was an English soldier and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1622. He became a peer by writ of acceleration in 1626 and by inheritance in 1630. He fought in the Royalist army and was killed in action at the Battle of Hopton Heath.

==Life==

Northampton was the son of William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of London. He was created a Knight of the Bath on 3 November 1616. In 1621 he was elected Member of Parliament for Ludlow. Also in 1621, he was appointed Master of the Robes to the Prince of Wales and attended the latter in the adventure to Spain in 1623. He warmly supported the king in the Scottish expeditions, at the same time giving his advice for the summoning of the parliament, which &quot;word of four syllables&quot; he declared was &quot;like the dew of heaven&quot;. In 1626, he became Baron Compton by writ of acceleration. In 1630 he inherited the Earldom on the death of his father in 1630 and assumed his duties as Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire and Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire.

==Military career==

On the outbreak of the English Civil War, Northampton was entrusted with the execution of the Commission of Array in Warwickshire. After varying success and failure in the English Midlands, he fought at the Battle of Edgehill and, after Charles I of England&#x27;s return to Oxford, was given, in November 1642, the military supervision of Banbury and the neighbouring country. He was attacked in Banbury by the parliamentary forces on 22 December, but relieved by Prince Rupert of the Rhine the next day.

In March 1643, he marched from Banbury to relieve Lichfield and, having failed there, proceeded to Stafford, which he occupied. Thence on 19 March, accompanied by three of his sons, he marched out with his troops and engaged Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet and Sir William Brereton at the Battle of Hopton Heath.

He put to flight the enemy&#x27;s cavalry and took eight guns, but in the moment of victory, while charging too far in advance, he was surrounded by the parliamentarian soldiers. To those who offered him a quarter, he answered that he scorned to take a quarter from such base rogues and rebels as they were, whereupon he was slain by a blow on the head. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, describes his loss as a great one to the cause.

==Personal life==
Northampton married Mary, daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont, brother of Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham. Northampton and Mary had two daughters and six sons. The four eldest sons were Cavaliers in the Civil War, often seeing action together.
* James (1622–1681) succeeded his father as 3rd Earl of Northampton
* Charles (c. 1624–1661) MP for Northampton in 1661
* William (c. 1625–1663) one of the original members of the Royalist organisation, The Sealed Knot
* Spencer (c. 1629–1659), knighted in 1643 on the same day as Charles and William; died in Bruges
* Francis (c. 1629–1716) MP for Warwick from 1664 to 1679
* Henry (1632–1713) bishop of London from 1675 to 1713
* Anne married Sir Hugh Cholmeley, 4th Baronet, MP for Northampton and Thirsk
* Penelope married Sir John Nicholas, MP for Ripon from 1661 to 1679

Mary, Countess of Northampton, died on 18 March 1654 at Queen&#x27;s Street in London.

<doc id="699358" wikidata="Q1538236" url="?curid=699358" title="Jon and Vangelis">
<text>Jon and Vangelis was a music collaboration between British rock singer Jon Anderson (lead vocalist of the progressive rock band Yes) and Greek synthesiser musician Vangelis. The duo released four albums between 1980 and 1991.

==History==
In 1974, Vangelis was considered as a replacement for Rick Wakeman as keyboardist in Yes, and although the job went to Patrick Moraz, it led to several collaborations with Anderson, who contributed vocals to Vangelis&#x27; &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975) on the song &quot;So Long Ago, So Clear&quot;, harp to &quot;Opera Sauvage&quot; (1979) on &quot;Flamants Roses&quot; and finally vocals to &quot;See You Later&quot; (1980) on &quot;Suffocation&quot; and &quot;See You Later&quot;.

They recorded their first album together, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, in 1979, producing the major hit &quot;I Hear You Now&quot; as well as &quot;One More Time&quot;. Anderson wrote the lyrics and Vangelis composed the music. In 1980, Anderson left Yes and released his second solo album, &quot;Song of Seven&quot;. Vangelis released his &quot;See You Later&quot; album the same year, with Anderson contributing vocals to two songs. The two reunited to record their second album, &quot;The Friends of Mr Cairo&quot;, in 1981, including the songs &quot;Friends of Mr Cairo&quot; and &quot;State of Independence&quot;. Later pressings of the album included the UK top 10 hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Find My Way Home&quot;. In 1983, Anderson rejoined Yes and they released the album &quot;90125&quot;. Jon and Vangelis released their own album, &quot;Private Collection&quot;, the same year.

In 1986, the duo made a few attempts at writing a new album, but much of this work was never officially released under the Jon and Vangelis name. Twelve tracks were compiled on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Page of Life&quot;, while other songs from these sessions appeared in later works, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;, the last song on the 1989 album &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot;. Anderson ultimately took it upon himself to rework &quot;Page of Life&quot;, which was released in 1998 in the United States only with nine tracks. In 2011, Anderson approached Vangelis for a possible new collaboration but he did not receive a reply.

Vangelis died on 17 May 2022.

<text>Bennie Gordon Thompson (born January 28, 1948) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1993. A member of the Democratic Party, Thompson served as the chair of the Committee on Homeland Security from 2007 to 2011 and from 2019 to 2023. He was both the first Democrat and the first African American to chair the committee. Since 2011, he has been the only Democrat in Mississippi&#x27;s congressional delegation, and since 2018 he has been the dean of the delegation after Thad Cochran left Congress.

Thompson&#x27;s district includes most of Jackson and is the only majority-black district in the state. It is about long, wide, and borders the Mississippi River. The Mississippi Delta comprises the vast majority of the district.

==Early life, education, and career==
Thompson was born in Bolton, Mississippi, the son of Will Thompson and Annie (Lauris) Thompson. He attended Hinds County public schools and graduated from Hinds County Agricultural High School. He then attended Tougaloo College, from which he earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1968. He earned a Master of Science in educational administration from Jackson State University in 1972.

Thompson was a schoolteacher in Madison, Mississippi. He served as an alderman (1969–1973) and then mayor of Bolton (1973–1980) before being elected to the Hinds County Board of Supervisors, on which he served from 1980 to 1993.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Tenure===
When Mike Espy resigned from the United States House of Representatives in to become Secretary of Agriculture in 1993, Thompson ran in the special election to succeed him. With five other Democrats splitting the vote, he finished second, behind Republican Hayes Dent with 28% of the vote in the March 30, 1993, primary election. He then defeated Dent in the April 13 runoff with 55% of the vote. He won the seat again in 1994 and has been reelected 12 times. He has faced serious opposition only twice, when journalist Clinton LeSueur held him to 55% in 2002 and 58% in 2004.
Thompson became an outspoken advocate for the Gulf Coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit in 2005. From his position on the Homeland Security Committee, he pushed for accountability at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a careful review of the role of the Red Cross in the time of disaster. He also pursued waste, fraud, and abuse in hurricane contracting and called for preferences to be given to small and Gulf Coast businesses in the recovery and rebuilding of the affected states. Thompson is the founding member of the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery &amp; Rebuilding Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Thompson&#x27;s voting record has been decidedly liberal; he is by far the most liberal member of the Mississippi delegation and arguably one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent the state. He is a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. His legislative platform focuses mainly on homeland security, civil rights, agriculture and rural issues, equal education, and health care reform. In 1975, he became one of the original plaintiffs in the Ayers Case, which concerned the adequate funding of predominantly black educational institutes in Mississippi. In 2000, Thompson wrote legislation that created the National Center for Minority Health and Health Care Disparities.

During his tenure as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Thompson focused on assuring that state and local officials, as well as first responders (fire, police, EMTs), got the resources they needed to protect their communities. Thompson was particularly concerned about local officials getting adequate resources, having been a volunteer firefighter and a local elected official for 24 years.

Thompson was one of 31 House Democrats to object to the certification of the results of the 2004 presidential election in Ohio. President George W. Bush won Ohio, the state the representatives objected to counting, by 118,457 votes. Democrats claimed the results were tainted by irregularities or fraud. These claims were investigated and rejected by journalists, and Democratic nominee John Kerry, who did not contest the election result. As of 2021, Thompson stands by his vote, claiming it was &quot;based on what the issues are at that time. But again, I didn&#x27;t tear up the place because I cast a vote.&quot;

Along with John Conyers, in April 2006 Thompson brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case, &quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot;, was ultimately dismissed.

On January 5, 2007, Thompson introduced H.R.1, &quot;Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007&quot;, the first bill of the 110th Congress. The bill, cosponsored by more than 100 House Members, provided for the implementation of the 9/11 Commission&#x27;s remaining recommendations. It included provisions requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism. The bill had bipartisan support and passed 299–128 on January 9, 2007. On July 27, 2007, the Conference Report on H.R. 1 passed the House overwhelmingly, 371–40. The previous day, it had passed the Senate 85–8. The President signed H.R. 1 into law on August 3, 2007.

With the passage of H.R. 1, Thompson is the first African-American Chairman of a House Committee to have a House–Senate Conference on the first bill introduced in either the House or the Senate in any given Congress.

On December 27, 2009, commenting on reports that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who had allegedly tried to set off a suicide bomb on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, had subsequently confessed to being trained and equipped in Yemen,
Thompson called for a halt to all current plans with regard to Yemen in light of Abdulmutullab&#x27;s ties there, including plans to repatriate approximately 80 Yemeni captives in Guantanamo.
Thompson is a supporter, and one of the proposers of, a bill to prevent auto insurance companies from using credit scores to set their rates, which supporters claim would lower rates for Americans in financial struggle. The bill proposed that auto insurance rates be based solely on factors related to &quot;skills and responsibility behind the wheel&quot;, excluding factors such as debt or poor credit elsewhere. The bill has not been enacted.

Thompson has also been a supporter of a measure to increase screening and background checks for pilot trainees to reduce chances of terrorist exploitation. The bill, H.R. 6159, would require all applicants to go through a waiting period while they are screened and cleared by the Department of Homeland Security. Currently, only foreign-born trainees are required to go through this screening. The bill has not been enacted.

In July 2014, Thompson joined Senator Ron Wyden in introducing a bill to limit the number of documents that are classified and to overhaul the security clearance system. The bill stalled and was not passed.

On April 1, 2020, Thompson and other Democratic lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee introduced legislation that would create a commission tasked with &quot;producing a full and complete accounting of the nation&#x27;s preparedness and response to the coronavirus&quot;. He compared this to the 9/11 Commission, saying, &quot;while we don&#x27;t yet know the full impact the coronavirus will have on the nation,&quot; already &quot;more Americans have been killed by the virus than died in the September 11, 2001, attacks&quot;. A bipartisan group of House lawmakers would appoint 25 commission members, and 18 months after its initial meeting, a &quot;public report detailing recommendations for the development of a national plan to address public health and the economic and social impacts of future pandemics&quot; would be published.

For his tenure as the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee in the 116th Congress, Thompson earned an &quot;A&quot; grade from the non-partisan Lugar Center&#x27;s Congressional Oversight Hearing Index.

On March 3, 2021, Thompson was the only House Democrat to vote against the For the People Act, a top legislative priority of House Democrats that would reform campaign finance and election laws and expand voting rights. Despite initially cosponsoring the bill, Thompson said his vote &quot;was no accident&quot;, explaining, &quot;My constituents opposed the redistricting portion of the bill as well as the section on public finances. I always listen and vote in the interest of my constituents.&quot;

In April 2024, Thompson introduced (along with eight other Democrats) a bill to strip Secret Service protection from convicted felons (intended to include former President Donald Trump) after Trump was convicted in New York in May 2024.

=== Negotiating the January 6 Commission and chairing the Select Committee ===
On January 7, 2021, Thompson issued a statement about the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In the statement, he wrote, &quot;There must be a thorough Congressional investigation into the clear and massive breakdowns in preparedness and response. My Committee has been examining the threat from domestic terrorism, right-wing extremism, and white nationalism for ten years and this will be at the top of our agenda for the new Congress.&quot;

On February 13, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans for a bicameral commission to investigate the attack on the Capitol, modeled after the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission), an independent panel that investigated the attacks of September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission was created in 2002 by Congress and issued a detailed report on its findings 15 months later. Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tasked Thompson and John Katko, the House Homeland Security Committee&#x27;s highest-ranking members, with negotiating the commission&#x27;s establishment resolution. Despite initial bipartisan support for a commission, by March, disputes between Democrats and Republicans over the proposed investigation&#x27;s scope and whether the commission would have an equal number of members from each party stalled the commission&#x27;s creation.

On May 14, 2021, Thompson and Katko announced H.R. 3233, &quot;The National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex Act&quot;. The resolution introduced to the House on May 19 met all Republican objections; it contained an equal number of members from each party, required approval of both parties to issue subpoenas, and set a firm deadline of December 31, 2021, to complete the report. The bill to form the commission passed the House, 252–175, with 35 Republicans and every Democrat supporting it. On May 28, Senate Republicans used a filibuster to block taking up the bill. Thompson issued a statement denouncing Senate Republicans, calling it appalling that Mitch McConnell allowed the bill to be filibustered even after hearing from Officer Brian Sicknick&#x27;s mother and her support for the bill.

On July 1, 2021, Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose Thompson to chair the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. According to Thompson&#x27;s friends and advisors, his national security expertise qualified him to chair the committee. As chair, Thompson had the sole authority to sign and issue a subpoena. According to a Congressional Research Service survey, this was the only active House committee with this authorization in the 117th Congress, found under Section 5: Procedures in H.Res 503, as most House committees can issue and authorize subpoenas only with a majority vote of the committee/subcommittee or by consulting the ranking minority member. Most House committees can have a member designated by the committee to authorize subpoenas.

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Homeland Security (Ranking Member)
**As Ranking Member of the committee, Rep. Thompson is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in any subcommittee hearing, per the committee&#x27;s rules.

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Black Caucus
* Congressional Gaming Caucus
* Congressional Rural Caucus
* Congressional Sunbelt Caucus
* Renewable Energy &amp; Energy Efficiency Caucus
* Congressional Travel &amp; Tourism Caucus
* Tennessee Valley Authority Caucus
* Congressional Children&#x27;s Working Group
* National Guard &amp; Reserve Components Congressional Members Organization
* Afterschool Caucuses
* United States–China Working Group

===Legislation sponsored===
* Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2013 (H.R. 1204; 113th Congress) – Thompson introduced this bill on March 14, 2013. If it became law, the bill would have directed the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish in the TSA an Aviation Security Advisory Committee and consult with it about matters of aviation security.
* Thompson is also supporting a bill to prevent sleeping in United States Congress offices.

===Electoral history===


==National politics==
Thompson was the Permanent Chair of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

=== Lawsuit against Trump ===
On February 16, 2021, on behalf of Thompson, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a federal lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of inciting violence on January 6 at the U.S. Capitol assault. The suit came three days after Trump was acquitted in the second Senate impeachment trial for inciting the riot. After the acquittal, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said in a speech he voted to acquit Trump because he believes the Senate cannot try a former president, but encouraged litigation against Trump, saying: &quot;We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.&quot; Included in the lawsuit as defendants are Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the two organizations the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. The lawsuit alleges that, by preventing Congress &quot;by the use of force, intimidation, and threat&quot; from carrying out its constitutional duties (the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count) Trump, Giuliani and the two hate groups violated the 1871 Third Enforcement Act (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act).

==Personal life==
Thompson is married to London Johnson of Mound Bayou, Mississippi, and has a daughter, BendaLonne, a granddaughter, Jeanna, and a grandson, Thomas. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity (Gamma Rho – Tougaloo College) and a lifetime member of the Asbury United Methodist Church in Bolton.

==Recognition==

In January 2025, President Joe Biden named Thompson as a recipient of the Presidential Citizens Medal, along with nineteen others.

He was nominated for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for his &quot;defense of freedom and democracy,&quot; along with the other members of the January 6th Committee.

<text>John Harris Harbison (born December 20, 1938) is an American composer and academic.

==Life==
John Harris Harbison was born on December 20, 1938, in Orange, New Jersey, to the historian Elmore Harris Harbison and Janet German Harbison. The Harbisons were a musical family; Elmore had studied composition in his youth and Janet wrote songs. Harbison&#x27;s sisters Helen and Margaret were musicians as well. He won the prestigious BMI Foundation&#x27;s Student Composer Awards for composition at the age of 16 in 1954. He studied music at Harvard University (BA 1960), where he sang with the Harvard Glee Club, and later at the Berlin Musikhochschule and at Princeton (MFA 1963). He is an Institute Professor of music at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a former student of Walter Piston and Roger Sessions. His works include several symphonies, string quartets, and concerti for violin, viola, and double bass.

Harbison won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1987 for &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot;, and in 1989 he received a $305,000 MacArthur Fellowship. In 1998, he received the 4th annual Heinz Award in the Arts and Humanities. He was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal in 2000. In 2006, a recording of his &quot;Mottetti di Montale&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Small Ensemble Performance category.

The Metropolitan Opera commissioned Harbison&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to celebrate James Levine&#x27;s 25th anniversary with the company. The opera premiered on December 20, 1999, conducted by Levine, with Jerry Hadley, Dawn Upshaw, Susan Graham, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, Mark Baker, Dwayne Croft, and Richard Paul Fink among the cast.

In 1991, Harbison was the music director of the Ojai Music Festival in conjunction with Peter Maxwell Davies. He has served as principal guest conductor for Emmanuel Music in Boston. After founding director Craig Smith&#x27;s death in 2007, Harbison was named acting artistic director. Harbison and his wife, Rose Mary Harbison, a violinist, ran the Token Creek Chamber Music Festival from 1989 to 2022.

<doc id="699366" wikidata="Q452955" url="?curid=699366" title="Gene Taylor (Mississippi politician)">
<text>Gary Eugene Taylor (born September 17, 1953) is an American politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1989 to 2011 and previously a member of the Mississippi Senate from 1983 to 1989. He was defeated for re-election in 2010 by State Representative Steven Palazzo. In 2014, he changed his long-time membership from the Democratic Party, becoming a Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.sunherald.com/2014/02/28/5377861/moore-will-run-again-for-congress.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he ran for election against Palazzo to return to the House of Representatives. Securing only 43 percent of the vote, Taylor lost in the primary.

Following his congressional career, Taylor served on the Hancock County Port and Harbor Commission until 2014. He consulted for the defense industry before becoming a director for Overseas Shipholding Group in 2018.

==Early life, education and career==
Taylor was born in New Orleans on September 17, 1953. He attended De La Salle High School, graduating in 1971. He graduated from Tulane University in 1976 where he majored in political science and history. He completed additional post-graduate work in business and economics at the University of Southern Mississippi from 1978 through 1980.

Taylor worked as a sales representative for Stone Container Corporation, working a territory from New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, from 1977 through 1989.

From 1971 through 1984, Taylor served in the United States Coast Guard Reserve, where he attained the rank petty officer first class. While in the coast guard, he commanded a search and rescue boat and earned several commendations.

==Early political career==
Taylor was elected to the Bay St. Louis City Council in 1981, and then to a vacant seat in the Mississippi State Senate in 1983. As a State Senator, Taylor and fellow Senator Steven Hale filed a lawsuit challenging the Senate powers of Democratic Lieutenant Governor Brad Dye. Taylor and Hale claimed that Dye&#x27;s control of committee appointments violated the state constitution&#x27;s separation of powers. The Supreme Court of Mississippi sided with Dye, but the suit against a powerful leader from his own party helped establish Taylor&#x27;s reputation for political independence.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Taylor was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most conservative among Democrats in the House. 
According to a 2011 survey by the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Taylor was the most conservative Democrat in the House.

He represented a district that had turned almost solidly Republican at the national level, though as late as 2010 most local offices were split between the two parties. The 4th has not supported the official Democratic presidential candidate since 1956 (when the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson). During Taylor&#x27;s final term, it was the most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+20. In 2000, 2004, and 2008, it gave the Republican presidential candidate his best total in the state. It was a foregone conclusion that Taylor would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.

A leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee, Taylor led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees and extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who became the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy&#x27;s dependence on imported oil. Taylor was also a member of the Readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services committee in the 110th Congress.

In House Armed Services Committee hearings, Taylor was sharply critical of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other administration witnesses, particularly regarding shortages of armor for troops and vehicles in Iraq. He decried the lack of urgency to speed up production and procurement of armored vehicles and jammers to block the signals of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

He voted for all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton in 1998—the only Democrat in Congress to do so. He was one of just five Democrats to support at least one article of impeachment. He refused to endorse Clinton&#x27;s reelection bid in 1996, but refused to switch parties despite numerous overtures from the Republicans. In the 2004 Democratic primaries, Taylor endorsed Wesley Clark. He voted for John McCain in 2008. The Christian Coalition gave Taylor an overall rating of 76% and he has endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment.

Taylor was a strong critic of the Bush Administration&#x27;s fiscal policy. He voted against the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, claiming that the cuts contained in those bills would only increase the national debt. He derided the prescription drug plan passed in 2003 as a giveaway to companies that donate to the Republican Party. He was one of the House&#x27;s most vehement opponents of free trade agreements and was strongly opposed to the Bush administration&#x27;s proposals for reforming Social Security. He also voted at times with more liberal members of the House with regards to Cuba. Since coming to the House, he voted in favor of most campaign finance laws and other laws favored by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party to reform politics.

Taylor was a staunch and consistent opponent of most free trade agreements. He voted against NAFTA and GATT. He voted against fast-track authority in 1998 and 2002. He also opposed Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China in 2000.

Taylor has a mixed voting record on environmental issues; he has voted repeatedly against the ban on drilling in Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), while voting at other times with the mainstream of his party. He has also denounced Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s ties to Halliburton.

In 2006, Taylor was the only Democrat to support all four amendments to the bill to renew the Voting Rights Act. However, Taylor did vote in favor of final passage of the unamended bill, as did all House Democrats.

Taylor has been a staunch advocate of maintaining the &quot;Buy American&quot; requirements in Defense contracting, and of maintaining the Jones Act requirements that vessels operating between U.S. ports must be American-flagged, American-made, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens. In February 2007, he was one of two Democrats to oppose &quot;H CON RES 63&quot;, which expressed opposition to a troop surge in the Iraq War.

Much of Taylor&#x27;s district took a direct hit from Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed his home in Bay St. Louis (27 miles west of Biloxi) as well as Lott&#x27;s home in Pascagoula. He moved to Kiln while he rebuilt his home in Bay St. Louis. 
When former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown appeared before the committee, Taylor reacted angrily to Brown&#x27;s attempts to put primary responsibility for the failed response at the state and local level. Taylor seemed particularly upset that several first responders in Hancock County, his home county, were forced to loot a Wal-Mart to get food and supplies. They also had to wait several days after the storm before they got any help from FEMA workers. He told Brown that FEMA &quot;fell on (its) face&quot; in its response to Katrina, which he said rated &quot;an F-minus in my book.&quot;

In April 2009, Taylor voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

==Political campaigns==

===1988===
After one term in the State Senate, Taylor ran as the Democratic candidate to succeed Republican incumbent and House Minority Whip Trent Lott in what was then the 5th District when Lott made a successful run for the Senate. He lost to Harrison County Sheriff Larkin I. Smith by almost 10 points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee offered very little help to Taylor, believing the district to be too heavily Republican. Vice President George H. W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis by approximately a 70 to 30 margin in the district, and Lott beat Wayne Dowdy by a similar margin in the Senate race. Although about 30,000 Bush and Lott voters split their tickets to vote for Taylor, he could not overcome the Republican tide in the district.

===1989===
Smith died in a plane crash eight months later. In the special election to fill Smith&#x27;s seat, Taylor picked up 42 percent of the vote to lead Republican Thomas H. Anderson, Jr. and Democrat Mike Moore in the first round. Some leading Democrats had tried to convince Taylor to stand aside and not seek the position in deference to Moore, who was the state&#x27;s Attorney General and who was also a Gulf Coast resident, but Taylor doubled Moore&#x27;s vote total on the first ballot. Two weeks later, Taylor beat Anderson, Lott&#x27;s Chief of Staff, with 65 percent of the vote. Taylor took office on October 24, 1989.

===1990 through 2008===
Taylor won a full term in 1990 with 81 percent of the vote against realtor Sheila Smith, the widow of his predecessor in the House. He easily turned back spirited reelection challenges in 1992, 1994 and 1996, taking over 60 percent of the vote each time. However, he was reelected in 1998 with 77 percent of the vote and was reelected five more times after that by an average of 70 percent of the vote. His district was renumbered the 4th after the 2000 redistricting cost Mississippi a congressional seat.

===2010===

Taylor was defeated by Republican state representative Steven Palazzo on November 2, 2010. His vote against Barack Obama for president in 2008 became a campaign issue when Taylor released campaign ads pointing to his support of McCain as evidence of his bipartisanship. However, Palazzo attacked Taylor for supporting Pelosi as Speaker and claimed Taylor voted with his party&#x27;s leadership 82 percent of the time. Taylor was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee.

In the following lame duck session of Congress, Taylor dropped his opposition to the Navy&#x27;s plan to buy both classes of Littoral combat ship, even though this greatly reduced the chances that a shipyard in his former district would then be able to bid for follow on contracts.

Proving just how Republican this district had become, no Democrat running in the district has cleared the 40 percent mark since Taylor left office, and only one has even cleared 30 percent.

===2014===

Taylor opposed Palazzo in the Republican primary in the June 2014 election. Taylor was seeking to become the first Mississippi U.S. Representative since 1884 to return to the House of Representatives after losing reelection. In an op-ed that ran in &quot;The Sun-Herald,&quot; the largest newspaper in the district, Taylor said that when he began seriously considering a bid for his own seat, he never even considered running as a Democrat because he had always considered himself a conservative, and the Democrats&#x27; turn to the left made him realize that &quot;my views and vision naturally fit in the Republican Party.

Taylor, who was out-raised by Palazzo by almost 6-to-1 and out-spent by over 10-to 1, ran a grassroots campaign, emphasizing his work to secure funding for the district in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and his efforts to support veterans and funding for military bases in the district. He contrasted this with Palazzo&#x27;s vote against funding for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and supporting sequestration which cut the defense budget. Taylor lost the primary, securing 43% of the vote to Palazzo&#x27;s 50.5%, coming a few thousand votes short of forcing Palazzo into a runoff.

==Post-congressional career==
Taylor was appointed to the Hancock County Port and Harbor Commission by District 3 Supervisor Lisa Cowand in March 2012 and served on the commission until 2014; he provided oversight for Stennis International Airport and Port Bienville Industrial Park. From September 2011 to December 2013, Taylor was a consultant at Navistar Defense, a defense firm.

Taylor has worked as a director for Overseas Shipholding Group since 2018.

==Personal life==
Taylor and his wife Margaret have three children. He holds a black belt in Taekwondo. Taylor is Roman Catholic.

<doc id="699369" wikidata="Q949384" url="?curid=699369" title="John Sullivan (Oklahoma politician)">
<text>John Alfred Sullivan (born January 1, 1965) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for (based in the Tulsa area) from 2002 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Sullivan was initially elected in 2002. On June 26, 2012, Sullivan lost renomination to political newcomer Jim Bridenstine in what was considered a major upset.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Sullivan was born in Oklahoma City and graduated from Bishop Kelley High School in Tulsa. He subsequently entered Northeastern State University, where he received a B.B.A. in marketing, in 1992. Prior to holding elected office, Sullivan worked in the private sector for Love Travel Centers as a regional sales manager and for BAMA Transportation as a fleet manager.

Sullivan was a Republican member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1995 to 2002, where he served as minority whip.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, incumbent Steve Largent resigned from Congress to focus on his campaign for governor. Sullivan entered the Republican primary for his seat running against the incumbent governor Frank Keating&#x27;s wife, Cathy, in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Sullivan won the February special election and went on to hold the seat in the general election in November.

===Tenure===
During the 2004 election campaign, Sullivan&#x27;s police record became public. Local media concluded he had at least three arrests:
for assault and battery of an off-duty police officer in 1982, when he was 17 years old, and for public intoxication and disturbing the peace in 1985, while still under-age. The most recent arrest, at age 27, was due to an outstanding bench warrant issued after he failed to appear in court for a traffic violation.

Sullivan voted to make the PATRIOT Act permanent, without any future option for Congressional review or revocation.

In the 110th Congress, he served as an Assistant Minority Whip under House Minority Whip Roy Blunt. He held the same position in both the 111th and 112th Congress under Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy.

On October 3, 2008, Sullivan was one of two Oklahoma Republican congressmen to vote for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program. On December 9, 2008, Sullivan voted against a bailout of the automobile industry saying &quot;taxpayers should not be asked to reward failure by subsidizing the very business practices that got them into this situation in the first place&quot;. He also was a proponent of the 2009 Tea Party protests which condemned any bailouts, and also spoke at a rally in Tulsa.

On December 16, 2010, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) named Sullivan as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power.

In December 2011, Sullivan was named a co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee&#x27;s most significant fundraising effort of the 2012 election cycle, the annual March dinner. The dinner was viewed as a tremendous success, drawing in a record-breaking $12 million for republican Congressional candidates across the country. NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas praised Sullivan and the other co-chairman saying they did &quot;a phenomenal job in their efforts to make this years event a huge success&quot;.

Sullivan was tapped to serve on the House Energy and Commerce Leadership team for the 112th Congress. He was the primary sponsor of H.R. 1380, the New Alternative Transportation to Give America Solutions (NAT GAS) Act of 2011, legislation designed to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil by encouraging more natural gas powered vehicles on American roads.

He introduced legislation to study the cumulative economic impact of twelve significant EPA regulations which was passed by the House Energy and Power Subcommittee on May 24, 2011. In February 2011, Sullivan offered an amendment to block the EPA&#x27;s decision to sell a higher blend, E15, ethanol gasoline for late model cars which passed by a vote of 285–136. Sullivan also sponsored the Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation (TRAIN) Act of 2011 (H.R. 2401), &quot;to require analyses of the cumulative and incremental impacts of certain rules and actions of the Environmental Protection Agency, and for other purposes&quot;, which has passed the House and will go on to the Senate.

On February 22, 2012, at a town hall meeting in Bixby, Sullivan said shooting senators would be the only way to pass the Ryan Budget: &quot;You know but other than me going over there with a gun and holding it to their head and maybe killing a couple of them.&quot; The next day he released an apology through his spokesperson.

On June 26, 2012, Sullivan was upset in the Republican primary by Jim Bridenstine.

According to the American Conservative Union, Sullivan was consistently among the most conservative members of Congress. He received a 100% rating from the organization in 2009 and 2010 earning their &quot;Defender of Liberty&quot; award both years. He is opposed to all legalized abortion, believes that life begins at conception, and opposes stem cell research on embryonic cells. He has been rated 100% by the Christian Coalition for his views. He is opposed to gun control and has been endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund for his position.

He supported a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning and wishes to strip the independent judiciary of the ability to decide any question pertaining to the interpretation of the Pledge of Allegiance. He had been rated as 0% by the ACLU on civil rights issues. He also supported continued U.S. military involvement in Iraq and opposed any &quot;rapid troop pullout&quot;.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power (Vice Chair)
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Vice Chair – Energy and Power)

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Judy Beck, have four children.

===Alcoholism===
On May 28, 2009, Sullivan entered the Betty Ford Center in California to receive treatment for his addiction to alcohol.

== Electoral history ==
*The first 2002 election was the special election on January 8 to fill the remainder of Steve Largent&#x27;s term upon his retirement. Write-in and minor candidate notes: David Fares received 388 votes in the 2002 special election.

<doc id="699370" wikidata="Q896763" url="?curid=699370" title="Brad Carson">
<text>Bradley Rogers Carson (born March 11, 1967) is an American lawyer and politician who is the 21st President of the University of Tulsa. A member of the Democratic Party, he served two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2005.

He is the only person to have voted on the authorization of the Iraq War in Congress and to have subsequently fought in it. He served with the 84th EOD Battalion of the US Army in 2008–2009, earning a Bronze Star. From 2015 to 2016, Carson was the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, where he initiated a number of notable reforms to include opening up all combat positions to women, open service by transgender service members, and new recruiting and retention practices. He served as Under Secretary of the Army from 2014 to 2015 and as General Counsel of the Army from 2012 to 2014.

On April 5, 2021, the University of Tulsa announced Carson had been selected to be the 21st president of the university, effective July 1, 2021.

In 2024, Carson launched Americans for Responsible Innovation, a new policy group dedicated to artificial intelligence. He currently serves as President of ARI, which is based in Washington, D.C, while remaining President of the University of Tulsa.

==Early life and education==
Carson was born in Winslow, Arizona. His father worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. During Carson&#x27;s childhood the family relocated a number of times, resulting in Carson being raised in several different Native American communities, including reservations in Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas, as well as the Eastern Band Cherokee Reserve in North Carolina. As a teenager, Carson moved back to Oklahoma, where his family has roots in the Cherokee Nation, of which Carson is an enrolled member.

Carson studied at Jenks High School and Baylor University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He became the first student at Baylor in 55 years to be awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. As a Rhodes Scholar, Carson went to Trinity College, Oxford, and earned a second BA (which became an MA a few years later) in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics. He attended the University of Oklahoma College of Law, graduating at the top of his class in 1994.

According to &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot;, Carson had originally intended to attend Yale Law School, only to change his mind while at Oxford.

== Career ==
After graduation from the University of Oklahoma, Carson took a job at a prestigious Oklahoma law firm, Crowe &amp; Dunlevy. In 1996, his firm was awarded the Exceptional Contribution to Legal Services Award by Legal Services of Eastern Oklahoma. In 1997 Carson was selected as a White House Fellow, where he was assigned to The Pentagon as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense.

=== Election to Congress ===
In 2000, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from Oklahoma&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District, located in the northeastern part of the state. In the primary, Carson defeated long-term state representative Bill Settle, who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Oklahoma House of Representatives.

After redistricting changed the political composition of his district to be much more favorable to a Democratic candidate, Carson was reelected in 2002 with nearly 75 percent of the vote.

During his tenure in Congress, Carson was generally seen as a moderate Democrat. He was a member of the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. He served on the Transportation Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, and the Small Business Committee. On October 10, 2002, Brad Carson was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

=== 2004 U.S. Senate election ===

In 2004, Carson did not seek reelection to the House, and ran for the open U.S. Senate seat that was being vacated by retiring Republican Don Nickles. He easily won the Democratic primary, and after a tough campaign, lost the election to Republican Tom Coburn, his predecessor in the House. Despite Carson&#x27;s loss, election analyst Stuart Rothenberg called the Carson campaign the best-run campaign in the nation in 2004. The &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; called him &quot;The Perfect Democrat&quot; After the election, Carson wrote an article for &quot;The New Republic&quot; which was the subject of much discussion. He was succeeded in the House by fellow Democrat Dan Boren.

=== Post-Congressional work ===
After the 2004 Senate election, Carson&#x27;s term in the United States Congress expired on January 3, 2005; Carson was succeeded by Dan Boren. Carson indicated that he had no immediate plans to seek political office, and, in January 2005, he accepted a semester-long teaching fellowship specializing in U.S. politics at Harvard University. Upon leaving Harvard, he returned to his hometown of Claremore, Oklahoma, and worked as chief executive officer of Cherokee Nation Businesses, which is owned by the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma in Catoosa, Oklahoma.

As an expert in Indian law, Carson oversaw one of the largest businesses in the state, with thousands of employees, hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, and more than a dozen in-house lawyers who specialized in Indian and corporate law. In December 2008, Carson left his post at Cherokee Nation Businesses to deploy to Iraq as an Intelligence Officer in the U.S. Navy. He was officer-in-charge of weapons intelligence teams embedded with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 84th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion in the nine southern provinces of Iraq; the teams worked with EOD teams at seven bases and investigated bomb sites, caches, smuggling routes, and other activities related to improvised explosive devices. For this work, Carson received, among other awards, the Bronze Star. On his return, he was elected to the board of Cherokee Nation Businesses.

==== University of Tulsa ====
In January 2010, Carson assumed a position as professor of business and law at the University of Tulsa, and as director of the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization funded by billionaire George Kaiser&#x27;s family foundation. In his academic work, Carson has written extensively about the economics of renewable energy. He has also contributed journalism to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Blueprint&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In 2010, Carson contributed to a symposium issue of &quot;Democracy: A Journal of Ideas&quot;, in which he was one of ten writers (including Martha Nussbaum, Michael Sandel, and others) discussing the future of progressive political thought and politics. He is the author of several other works, including a guide to federal appellate practice, a work co-authored with Judge Robert Bacharach (who was appointed by President Obama to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals). More recently, he has been working on a long series of articles about military reform for the online journal War on the Rocks.

==== Work with Barack Obama ====
Carson had met Barack Obama in 2004 when they were both nominees of the Democratic Party for open seats in the United States Senate. Carson endorsed Obama in 2006 for the 2008 presidential election. Carson served as Obama&#x27;s personal representative in the approval of candidates for delegates from Oklahoma to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Oklahoma was the first state to name its complete delegation to the 2008 Democratic Convention.

=== Obama administration ===

On September 14, 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Carson to serve as the General Counsel of the United States Department of the Army. The United States Senate confirmed Carson by unanimous consent on December 17, 2011.

On January 6, 2014, President Obama nominated Carson to be Under Secretary of the Army, to replace Joseph W. Westphal, whom the president had nominated to be the United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. On February 12, 2014, Carson was confirmed by the United States Senate and he was sworn in as the 31st Under Secretary of the Army on March 27, 2014. Fellow Oklahoma Democrat, Principal Chief Bill John Baker of the Cherokee nation, praised Carson, saying, &quot;I applaud President Obama for nominating Brad Carson to this post [...] Brad is a Cherokee citizen and has committed his life to one of our Cherokee values: serving people. As a U.S. Congressman he served the people of Oklahoma&#x27;s second district, as a CEO he served Cherokee Nation Businesses and the Cherokee people [...] he will be a champion for our American military in his role as Army undersecretary.&quot;

As Chief Operating Officer of the Department of the Army, Carson led day-to-day-business operations of the global U.S. Army business enterprise, with over 490,000 active duty soldiers, 335,000 National Guard soldiers, 200,000 Army Reserve soldiers, and over 330,000 civilians. He supervised the development and submission of the Army&#x27;s budget, which exceeded $150 billion. In a move lauded by veterans groups, Carson made national headlines when he formally apologized to veterans of the Iraq War for the Army&#x27;s mishandling of chemical weapons exposures.
Carson served as the acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness from April 2015 until April 2016, resigning while still awaiting Senate formal approval. As undersecretary, Carson led a number of pioneering initiatives such as the Department of Defense&#x27;s &quot;Force of the Future&quot; reforms, the largest personnel changes to the military and civilian workforce in nearly 50 years. Carson oversaw the historic opening of all combat positions to women. He assisted in the reformation of the military retirement system for the first time in 70 years and set new policy for transgender servicemembers.

From 2017 to 2021, Carson was a professor of public policy at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. 

=== The University of Tulsa president ===
Carson was sworn in as President of the University of Tulsa in July 2021. He succeeded Gerard Clancy, who left office after a vote of no-confidence. In July 2023, Carson was president when the university launched a new Honors College, focusing on literature and philosophy. During Carson&#x27;s tenure in 2022, the university had more National Merit Scholars per capita than other university in the nation. In 2023, Carson pushed for the organizing of more concerts at Chapman Stadium, seeing the university hold the first major concert in the venue since 1990 with the performance of Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, and Alice Cooper. He also expanded the university&#x27;s programs in Tulsa&#x27;s arts district and led the university in taking over organizing responsibilities for Tulsa&#x27;s Mayfest.

In 2023, TU was recognized as a &quot;free speech&quot; university and was the first university in Oklahoma to receive a &quot;green light&quot; rating by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. This recognition was given after the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression aided Carson in revising the university&#x27;s policies on speech and assembly.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===
In late 2023, Carson announced he would be the co-founder and President of a new policy group, Americans for Responsible Innovation, dedicated to artificial intelligence. Americans for Responsible Innovation advocates for responsible guardrails on AI, including accounting oversight, incident reporting, and export controls.

== Personal life ==
Carson&#x27;s wife, Julie, served on the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. They live in Claremore, Oklahoma. They have one son, Jack. In 2017, Carson completed the Marathon des Sables, a 250-km ultramarathon in the Sahara Desert often called the world&#x27;s toughest footrace. In 2018, he completed the Jungle Ultra, a similar race through the Amazon jungle.

<doc id="699384" wikidata="Q3308443" url="?curid=699384" title="Michael Peroutka">
<text>Michael Anthony Peroutka (born 1952) is an American far-right politician, lawyer, and neo-Confederate activist from Maryland. He was the Republican nominee for Attorney General of Maryland in 2022, and was the Constitution Party candidate for president in 2004.

Peroutka is a former member of the League of the South, a white supremacist and white nationalist organization designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Peroutka is known for his pro-secessionist views, and has said that he is &quot;still angry&quot; that Maryland did not join the Confederacy in the Civil War. Peroutka has voiced support for disproven conspiracy theories about the September 11 terrorist attacks, falsely claiming that the attacks were an &quot;inside job&quot; accomplished using explosives.

Peroutka attended Loyola University Maryland and the University of Baltimore School of Law. He was the chairman of the Constitution Party of Maryland and a member of the executive committee of the Constitution Party National Committee. In 2014, he became a Republican and won election to the County Council of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, representing District 5.

He is of Czech descent.

==2004 presidential campaign==
In the 2004 United States presidential election, he was the Constitution Party&#x27;s candidate. His campaign slogan was &quot;God, Family, Republic&quot; and heavily featured Christian and socially conservative themes. His running mate was independent Baptist minister Chuck Baldwin. Peroutka gained support from many paleoconservatives, and was endorsed by the America First Party and Alaskan Independence Party. Peroutka was also endorsed by the League of the South and supported by a group called &quot;Southerners for Peroutka&quot;. Peroutka accepted the endorsement from the League at their 2004 national convention. Far-right radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones stated that he would be voting for Peroutka.

Peroutka appeared on the far-right radio show &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot; to promote his campaign, describing it as a &quot;Christian/Constitutionalist radio program&quot; and &quot;a great blessing to our cause&quot;. Paleoconservative political commentator Pat Buchanan stated on the September 7, 2004, edition of &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; that he was considering voting for Peroutka. The November 8, 2004, issue of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; contained endorsements by Taki Theodoracopulos and Howard Phillips (the latter having founded the party Peroutka represented). Peroutka received just over 0.01% of the national popular vote, finishing fifth nationally with almost 150,000 votes. This was a similar showing to previous Constitution Party candidacies of Howard Phillips, and made the party the only third party to increase its share of the vote in 2004. Kentucky Republican politician Matt Bevin&#x27;s support for Peroutka&#x27;s candidacy was used in a 2013 attack ad by opponent Mitch McConnell.

==Political positions==
Peroutka is a Christian nationalist who holds views outside the mainstream of U.S. political discourse, even within the modern Republican Party. He said that government officials must &quot;take a biblical worldview and apply it to civil law and government&quot; and referred to the principle of separation of church and state as a &quot;great lie.&quot; Peroutka views public schools as a Communist plot; he supports homeschooling and opposes government funding for education, stating that it is &quot;the 10th plank in the Communist Manifesto.&quot; He rejects laws and constitutional protections protecting abortion and same-sex marriage. 

In 2006, he voted in favor of disaffiliating the Independent American Party of Nevada from the Constitution Party due to their allowance for abortion in certain circumstances. In 2012, the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; reported that Peroutka was the single-largest donor to Roy Moore&#x27;s 2012 campaign for the Alabama Supreme Court, having contributed $50,000 of the total $78,000 received by Moore until December 31, 2011.

Peroutka is a former board member of the League of the South, a neo-Confederate organization that is classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. He was a member of the group&#x27;s board of directors from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, the Human Rights Campaign called Peroutka an &quot;active white supremacist and secessionist sympathizer&quot; due to his ties to the League. Peroutka told &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; that he &quot;continues to be a proud member of the League of the South,&quot; since it &quot;has a belief that the central government is too large, too spend-thrift and too out-of-control,&quot; but he called HRC&#x27;s characterization of him as a white-supremacist sympathizer &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;not at all true.&quot; In 2012, a video showed Peroutka asking a group to stand for the national anthem, and then leading them in the &quot;de facto&quot; Confederate anthem, &quot;Dixie&quot;. In 2013, he stated that &quot;all elevation or denigration of individuals or groups based on skin color is immoral and shameful.&quot; In October 2014, during his campaign for the Anne Arundel County Council, Peroutka announced that he had resigned from the League of the South board of directors and was no longer a member after discovering statements made by members that were &quot;contrary to [his] beliefs&quot;. He declined to disavow the group during his 2022 campaign for Maryland attorney general.

==Split from the National Constitution Party==
In 2006, the Maryland Constitution Party disaffiliated from the national party along with other state parties following a schism at the national party&#x27;s 2006 convention, in which it failed to disaffiliate the Nevada party despite its chairman and gubernatorial candidate&#x27;s support for legal abortion in some cases. Peroutka stated, &quot;At this point I could not, in good faith, represent the Constitution Party nor endorse any of its candidates. Unless serious changes occur, I could not run for President in 2008.&quot;

Peroutka&#x27;s supporters, however, collected enough signatures to get his name approved as a write-in candidate in Georgia for the 2008 presidential election.

==Republican Party==
===Election in 2014 to Anne Arundel County Council===
In February 2014, Peroutka switched his voter registration from Constitution Party to Republican and filed to run for a seat on the Anne Arundel County Council as well as a seat on the county&#x27;s Republican Central Committee. Peroutka won the seat on the Central Committee, becoming an official representative of the Republican Party in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Peroutka also won the primary election for county council from District 5 on June 24, defeating a number of other Republican candidates, including the incumbent councilman Dick Ladd. He won by 38 votes over Maureen Carr-York to become the Republican nominee in the November 2014 general election. Peroutka won in the general election with 53 percent of the vote and a margin of victory of nearly 1,900 votes over his Democratic opponent. His district covered Severna Park, Millersville, Arnold, and Broadneck. Peroutka, along with the rest of the council, was sworn in on December 1, 2014.

===Loss in 2018 re-election campaign===
Running for reelection from District 5 in June 2018, Peroutka lost the Republican primary to candidate Amanda Fiedler, 53 percent to 47 percent.

===2022 campaign for Attorney General of Maryland===
In February 2022, Peroutka filed to run for Attorney General of Maryland. He ran on the slogan &quot;Liberty forever, Mandates never!&quot; and a platform of opposing COVID-19 restrictions, fear of crime and immigration, election integrity, and opposition to abortion. Peroutka ran on a platform in which he prioritize what he called &quot;God-given, constitutionally-protected rights&quot; over state and federal laws, specifically those on abortion and same-sex marriage. He also pledged to take legal action against Governor Larry Hogan and local health officers for actions they took to slow the spread of COVID-19. Peroutka won the Republican primary on July 19, 2022, with 55.0 percent of the vote over his challenger Jim Shalleck. Peroutka&#x27;s victory made him one of several extremist candidates nominated by the Republican Party in 2022. 

During the general election, he said that he would accept the results of the election if they &quot;appear to be lawful and legal&quot;, but supported legal efforts by state delegate and Republican nominee for governor Dan Cox to block the counting of mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. Peroutka was defeated by Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Brown in the general election on November 8, 2022. On November 10, Peroutka said he would not concede the election to Brown, claiming without evidence that &quot;many odd and suspicious incidents were reported by poll watchers, and more reports are being gathered today.&quot;

==Support for creationism==
In May 2014, Peroutka, acting on behalf of the Elizabeth Streb Peroutka foundation, a charity he and his brother Stephen established and named after their mother, donated an Allosaurus skeleton to the Creation Museum, a 70,000-square-foot museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, that promotes the pseudoscientific young Earth creationist explanation of the origins of the universe put forth in Biblical literalism.

<doc id="699388" wikidata="Q1356373" url="?curid=699388" title="Ernest Istook">
<text>Ernest James &quot;Ernie&quot; Istook Jr. (born February 11, 1950) is a retired American lawyer and politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Oklahoma&#x27;s 5th congressional district. He held his congressional seat for 14 years, completing seven terms in the House. Currently, Istook is a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., and also a talk radio host. In 2010, Istook became a Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School leading a study on Propaganda in American Politics.

He was a member of the Appropriations and the Homeland Security committees. He was the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2006, running against incumbent Democratic governor Brad Henry. Istook lost the gubernatorial race by a very wide margin, getting only 33.5% of the vote to Henry&#x27;s 66.5%.

==Early life and career==
Istook&#x27;s grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Hungary through Ellis Island and spoke Hungarian at home. He graduated from Castleberry High School in Fort Worth, Texas in 1967 and received a bachelor of arts degree from Baylor University in Waco, Texas in 1971. He eventually moved to Warr Acres, a suburb of Oklahoma City.

He worked full-time as a radio news reporter first at KOMA (now KOKC) and then at WKY in Oklahoma City while attending law school, receiving a Juris Doctor degree from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1976. He was also a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. After graduation, he established his own law firm, and practiced law for 15 years.

Istook also was director of the Oklahoma State Alcoholic and Beverage Control Board (1977–1978), was legal counsel to popular Oklahoma governor David L. Boren (1978), and was a member of the board of the Metropolitan Library System (1982–1986), chairman of the Warr Acres city council (1982–1986), director of the Warr Acres Chamber of Commerce, and an Oklahoma state representative 1987–1993.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
===1992 election===
In the 1992 Republican primary, Istook challenged and defeated incumbent Deputy House Minority Whip Mickey Edwards in a three-way primary that also featured former federal prosecutor Bill Price. Both Istook and Price used Edwards&#x27; involvement in the House banking scandal to chip away at his support.

Istook narrowly defeated his Democratic challenger, Laurie Williams, in November, winning by only six points. He never faced another contest nearly that close, and was reelected six more times from what has long been considered the most Republican district in Oklahoma. The Democrats didn&#x27;t even put up a candidate against him in 1994.

Although Istook lives in Warr Acres, he was listed on the House roll as &quot;R-Oklahoma City&quot;.

===Political views===
As a member of Congress, Istook focused on issues surrounding national defense and homeland security, transportation, education, labor, social services and religious liberty. He is anti-abortion and supports the position that abortion should be prohibited except when the mother&#x27;s life is in danger. He does not support federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. Istook opposes gay marriage and the adoption of children into same-sex homes. He has favored several constitutional amendments including an amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment to restrict burning the U.S. flag.

He introduced the &quot;Religious Freedom Amendment&quot;, a Constitutional Amendment to permit school prayer, in 1995 and (slightly modified) in 1997. On June 4, 1998, the House voted 224–203, with 7 abstentions, in favor of it, but it failed as a Constitutional amendment, needing a 2/3 majority to pass. He reintroduced it in 1999, and again with different text in 2001, renamed the &quot;Religious Speech Amendment&quot;, and in 2003. The other efforts did not make it out of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution.

On economics, Istook opposed more federal funds for health coverage and supported welfare and Social Security reform, including the creation of personal accounts within Social Security. He supported the Bush administration&#x27;s tax cuts and wanted to make those permanent. He wrote a bill to relieve the tax burden for married couples, which was passed in February 2000 as the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. He favors expansion of free trade; he voted in favor of CAFTA. He wants the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization, wants the end of the estate tax, and supported Normal Trade Relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China to be made permanent. In 2004 Istook travelled to Beijing to speak with Chinese leaders and expand trade between the U.S. and China. In particular his visit focused on the opportunities for Oklahoma to trade in China.

Istook voted to make the USA PATRIOT Act permanent and supports intelligence gathering by the military. Istook favors military recruiting on college campuses that receive federal aid. Istook endorsed the Bush administration and its handling of the War in Iraq and supports higher Defense Department funding.

Istook does not support a U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol nor heavy taxpayer subsidies for alternative fuel sources. He supports drilling in ANWR.

===Congressional committees===
Istook served on several congressional committees during his time in the House. He was a member of the Appropriations Committee from the mid-1990s and chaired a number of its subcommittees including Treasury, Transportation, and Special Agencies. He also served on the Homeland Security Committee and was a founder of the re-established Republican Study Committee.

=== Transit funding controversies ===
Istook is against the current federal funding level for Amtrak. For several years, he chaired the subcommittee on Treasury, Transportation, and Special Agencies, which oversaw transportation funding. In 2004, Istook denied special transportation funding (earmarks) requests for districts of 21 Republican House members because the other Republicans had written a letter supporting of funding of $1.8 billion for Amtrak. Istook took the view that their request for major funding increases for Amtrak took precedence over their requests for their districts, and viewed those requests as trying to &quot;double-dip&quot; into the Treasury. Istook lost the chairmanship in 2005, in large part because others in the Republican party were still upset over his handling of this issue.

Istook introduced language into an FY2004 federal spending bill that would cut funding for transit authorities that sponsored advertisements contradicting current government policies and laws regarding marijuana. Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia later ruled that the &quot;Istook Amendment&quot;, as it came to be known, was unconstitutional on grounds that it violated the First Amendment, stating &quot;the government articulated no legitimate state interest in the suppression of this particular speech other than the fact that it disapproves of the message, an illegitimate and constitutionally impermissible reason&quot;.

=== Jack Abramoff ===
Istook received $29,000 in campaign contributions from Abramoff and some of his clients, and wrote letters urging the Bush administration to reject a casino proposal that Abramoff&#x27;s clients opposed. On January 9, 2006, Istook announced he would give $23,000 in Abramoff-related money that was donated to his re-election campaign or his PAC to the Boy Scouts of America. This is in addition to $6,000 in Abramoff-related donations given to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in December 2005. His congressional campaign paid back $5,126 to Abramoff&#x27;s Sports Suites LLC, for the use in 2003 of skyboxes by the congressman for an American Idol concert and a Washington Redskins game. Istook has denied any connection between the donations and his activities, saying in 2006, &quot;I barely knew the man.&quot;

Istook is identified in documents filed in June 2008 against his former chief of staff, John Albaugh, as &quot;Representative 4&quot;. According to the documents, Istook called Abramoff in 2003 to thank him in advance for use of one of Abramoff&#x27;s FedEx Field skyboxes for a fundraising event. Istook asked Abramoff which projects his clients wanted in the upcoming transportation bill. The government filing refers to an Abramoff e-mail saying Istook &quot;had basically asked what we want in the transportation bill&quot;, and telling his colleagues at Greenberg Traurig to &quot;make sure we load up our entire Christmas list&quot;. Four of Kevin A. Ring&#x27;s clients later received at least $1 million each in the transportation bill.
On June 2, 2008, Albaugh pleaded guilty to one count of corruption and conspiracy.

== 2006 gubernatorial race ==

On October 3, 2005, Istook announced he would run for governor of Oklahoma against Democratic incumbent Brad Henry. He was immediately the consensus frontrunner for the nomination, as a seven-term incumbent U.S. representative whose district covered most of the Oklahoma City area, the state&#x27;s largest media market.

In the July 2006 primary, he received 55% of the vote to become the Republican nominee. Oil businessman Bob Sullivan was second with 31%.

Henry and Istook faced each other in the November general election. After a heated campaign, Henry defeated Istook, gathering 66.5% of the total vote—the biggest landslide in an Oklahoma governor&#x27;s race in almost half a century. Istook even lost his own congressional district, as well as a number of areas that normally vote Republican. He only carried the three Panhandle counties of Beaver, Cimarron and Texas.

Istook&#x27;s campaign was managed by campaign manager Chip Englander, a political operative from California. National media attention was attracted when it turned out that Jordan Edmund, one of the campaign&#x27;s workers from California, had been one of the congressional pages who received unwelcome attention in the Mark Foley scandal.

==Post-congressional career==
Ernest Istook was a distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation and host of the conservative think tank&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Istook Live&quot;. Istook contributed opinion columns to a variety of outlets including &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Human Events&quot; &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and &quot;Newsmax&quot;. He has been a talk radio host. He has appeared frequently on national radio programs as a guest host and has filled-in for a number of talk radio hosts including Mark Levin, Jerry Doyle and on &quot;America&#x27;s Morning News&quot;. Istook has also been a guest analyst on national television including appearances on most major news programs.

He became a Fellow for the Institute of Politics at Harvard University&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government in early 2010, during which he taught a study group on Propaganda in American Politics. In 2014, Istook joined the Board of Advisors of the National Federation of Republican Assemblies. He is a member of the Council for National Policy.

He now teaches History and Political Sciences classes at Utah Valley University in Orem, UT and practices law.

== Personal life ==
In 2008, Istook was appointed to the National Advisory Board for the national children&#x27;s charity Operation Kids. He is also an active supporter of the Boy Scouts of America and served several years as a scoutmaster.

Istook and his wife Judy (whom he met through his radio job at KOKC and married in 1973) have five children, two sons and three daughters, and fifteen grandchildren. Istook, who comes from a Southern Baptist background, is now a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

<text>Istanbul University, also known as University of Istanbul (), is a prominent public research university located in Istanbul, Turkey. Founded by Mehmed II on May 30, 1453, a day after the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks, it was reformed as the first Ottoman higher education institution influenced by European approaches. The successor institution, which has been operating under its current name since 1933, is the first university in modern Turkey. 

Istanbul University is consistently ranked first in Turkey and among the top 500 universities in the world according to the recently published Shanghai Ranking. At present, there are 58,809 undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students studying in 112 academic units, including faculties, institutes, colleges, and vocational schools at 9 campuses. The main campus is adjacent to Beyazıt Square in Fatih, the capital district of the province, on the European side of the city.

Istanbul University alumni include Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Aziz Sancar and Nobel Prize in Literature winner Orhan Pamuk, as well as President of Turkey Abdullah Gül, six Prime Ministers of Turkey, including Suat Hayri Ürgüplü, Sadi Irmak, Nihat Erim, Refik Saydam, Naim Talu, Yıldırım Akbulut, and the current mayor of Istanbul Ekrem İmamoğlu. The alumni also include the longest-serving President of Israel Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, as well as David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharett, who both served as Prime Ministers of Israel.

== History ==
The origins of Istanbul University date back to 1453, when it was founded by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II as a school of philosophy, medicine, law and letters. The University of Constantinople, established in 425 CE by the Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II as the &quot;Pandidacterium&quot;, later became known as the Phanar Greek Orthodox College after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. In the early stages, Istanbul University also functioned as a medrese, an Islamic theological school. This madrasa is regarded as the precursor to the &quot;Darülfünûn&quot;, a technical institute or university (&quot;lit.&quot; House of Natural Sciences), which evolved into Istanbul University in 1933. Education in various sciences and fields, including medicine, mathematics, astronomy, cartography, geography, history, philosophy, religion, literature, philology, and law, became available and, until the 19th century, played a key role in educating the ruling cadres of Ottoman society. However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the time, a restructuring process began, leading to the establishment of &quot;Darülfünûn&quot;, the core of Istanbul University.
An institution of higher education named the &quot;Darülfünûn-u Osmanî&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; the Ottoman Polytechnic Institute) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871. Its first rector was Hasan Tahsini, regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century. In 1874 the &quot;Darülfünûn-u Sultanî (lit.&quot; the Royal College of Natural Sciences, ) began offering law classes in French, but was closed in 1881.

The Imperial College of Sciences, later known as &quot;Darülfünûn-u Şahâne&quot;, was reestablished in 1900 with departments in theology, arts, mathematics, science, and philology. In 1924, the faculties of law, medicine, arts and sciences were established in &quot;İstanbul Darülfünûnu&quot;, as the university was now called. Islamic theology was added in 1925, but in 1933 the university was reorganized without the latter.

The first modern applied physics courses were offered at the Darülfünûn on 31 December 1863, marking the beginning of a new era. On 20 February 1870, the school was renamed &quot;Darülfünûn-u Osmanî&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;. the Ottoman House of Multiple Sciences) and reorganized to meet the needs of modern sciences and technologies. Starting in 1874, some classes in literature, law, and applied sciences were held at the Lycée de Galatasaray, continuing regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as Darülfünûn-u Şahâne (&quot;lit.&quot; the Royal Polytechnic Institute), offering courses in mathematics, literature, and theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed İstanbul Darülfünûnu, with an expanded course offering and a modernized curriculum. The School of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences, Literature, and Theology were established.

On 21 April 1924, the Republic of Turkey recognized &quot;İstanbul Darülfünûnu&quot; as a state institution. On 7 October 1925, its administrative autonomy was established, and the schools, which had been part of the old medrese system, became modern faculties. The &quot;Darülfünûn&quot; then consisted of five faculties: medicine, law, letters, theology, and science. The professors were granted academic freedom as outlined in Article 2 of Law 493. On 1 August 1933, &quot;İstanbul Darülfünûnu&quot; was reorganized as &quot;İstanbul Üniversitesi&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Istanbul University) following the educational reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Classes officially began on 1 November 1933.

Before World War II, many German scientists, particularly those from fields such as medicine, natural sciences, and humanities, were forced to flee Germany due to pressure on anti-Nazi scholars and artists, many of whom were of Jewish origin. A significant number of these emigrants found refuge at Istanbul University, where they contributed to the growth of academic programs and research, enhancing the university&#x27;s intellectual environment and fostering scientific efforts in Turkey.

==Campus==
The university comprises seventeen faculties spread across five campuses. The main campus being on Beyazıt Square, which was originally built by Constantine the Great as the &quot;Forum Tauri&quot; and was later enlarged by Theodosius the Great as the &quot;Forum of Theodosius&quot; during the Roman period. Some Roman and Byzantine ruins are still visible on the grounds.

The building stands on the site of the Old Palace, the first palace built by the Ottoman Turks in Istanbul. Completed in 1458, the original wooden structure of the Old Palace included the harem quarters and various pavilions. Mehmed II resided there before moving to the newly constructed Topkapı Palace. Even after the royal family relocated, the Old Palace retained its significance, serving as a residence for the families of deceased sultans.

After the disbandment of the Janissary Corps in 1826, the Old Palace was assigned to the Bab-ı Seraskeri, the new military force of the Ottoman Empire. From this point on, the building was referred to as the Serasker Gate. The original wooden Serasker Gate building was demolished in 1864. The building began to serve as the Ottoman Ministry of War, in 1879. Following the establishment of the Republic in 1923, the Ministry of War, like other ministries, relocated to Ankara, and the building was handed over to Darülfünun, the first and only university of the Ottoman Empire. Located on the grounds is the Beyazıt Tower, an tall fire-watch tower. 

The current main building, designed by French architect Bourgerois, was completed in 1865-1866. In 1879, it began serving as the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Ministry of War. The Blue Hall and Pink Hall, located on the building&#x27;s second floor, are adorned in an orientalist decorative style, featuring ceiling and wall ornamentations that reflect the overall aesthetic of the structure. The room currently used as the Rector&#x27;s Office was originally the office of the Minister of War during the Ottoman Empire. The office also contains the desk of Enver Pasha, who served as the Minister of War from 1914 to 1918. The &quot;Kılıçlık Hall,&quot; which is used for academic meetings today, was originally the venue for sword-donning ceremonies for officers within the Ministry of War during the Ottoman Empire. Before holding meetings in the Kılıçlık Hall, officers would use the area on the right side of the hall to place their swords, hang their coats, and perform ablutions.

The building, which was damaged in an earthquake in 1894, was restored by Italian architect Raimondo D’Aronco. In 1950, it was again restored by Ekrem Hakkı Ayverdi. The Rectorate Building has undergone several renovations over the years, with the most recent restoration, including façade and marble cleaning, taking place in 1998. The main gate was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 500 lira banknotes of 1971–1984.

The building housing the Rare Books Library, designed by Kemaleddin Bey in 1913, is home to a collection of approximately 93,000 volumes, including printed and manuscript books, journals, newspapers, maps, plans, and notes in Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Greek and Latin. The collection also includes 911 albums known as the Abdülhamid II Collection, which contain 36,585 photographs. Additionally, the library holds the collections of prominent figures in Turkish politics and intellectual history, such as Zakirbaşı Hüseyin Halis Efendi, Hasan Rıza Pasha, Grand Vizier İbrahim Hakkı Pasha, Sheikh-ul-Islam Pirizade Mehmet Sahip Molla, and İbnülemin Mahmut Kemal İnal. In 1925, the collection of the Yıldız Palace Library was transferred to the Rare Books Library.

<text>The Meadow Valley Wash is a southern Nevada stream draining the Meadow Watershed that is bordered on three sides by the Great Basin Divide. The wash&#x27;s Lincoln County head point is in the Wilson Creek Range, and the wash includes two upper confluences (e.g., the Patterson Wash). Panaca is along the upper wash, and downstream of Caliente is the wash&#x27;s confluence with its east fork. Just before the junction with the Muddy River, the wash flows from Lincoln County into northeastern Clark County. It flows into the Muddy in the Moapa Valley just west of Glendale adjacent to Interstate 15 approximately northeast of Las Vegas.

In addition to the Wilson Creek Range, the watershed&#x27;s drainage divide is in the Delamar Mountains (to the west) and the Meadow Valley Range (east). The northern tip of the watershed is a triple watershed point with two Great Basin subregions: the Central Nevada Desert Basins and the Escalante-Sevier subregion.

==History==
William Andrews Clark&#x27;s 1903–1910 railroad that linked Pioche and Panaca operated through the wash until washed out by flooding.

<text>Humana Inc. is an American for-profit health insurance company based in Louisville, Kentucky. In 2023, the company ranked 42 on the Fortune 500 list, which made it the highest ranked (by revenues) company based in Kentucky. It is the fourth largest health insurance provider in the U.S.

==History==

===1961–1983: Nursing homes and hospitals===
Lawyers David A. Jones Sr. and Wendell Cherry founded a nursing home company in 1961. The company, known in 1968 as Extendicare Inc., became the largest nursing home company in the United States. In 1972, Jones and Cherry sold the nursing home chain to purchase hospitals.

In 1974, the partners changed the corporate name to Humana Inc. The name was meant to change public perception from &#x27;warehousing&#x27; or indifferently treating people to providing a higher level of human care and, by extension, more humane care. It grew in the following years, both by business and in 1978 through the takeover of American Medicorp Inc., which doubled the company&#x27;s size, and grew into the world&#x27;s largest hospital company in the 1980s. During this period, Humana developed the double corridor model for hospital construction. This design minimized the distance between patients and nurses by placing nursing support services in the interior of the building with patient rooms surrounding the perimeter.

===1984–present===
As the American health care system changed in the 1980s, &quot;one of its hospitals in Arizona lost a contract with the largest health-maintenance organization in the area [and] Humana created its own health insurance plan.&quot;

In 1993, Humana had become the largest hospital operator in the country, owning 77 hospitals. Humana executives spun off hospital operations from health insurance operations to create Galen Health Care. The following year they sold the 73 hospitals of Galen Health Care Inc. to Nashville-based Columbia Hospital Corporation of America for $3.4 billion.

In 1998, one year after Jones had stepped aside as CEO, United Healthcare made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Humana. Humana pulled out of the acquisition after United stock dropped $2.9 billion in value. In 2001, Humana was a cofounder of Avality.

In 2005, Humana entered into a business partnership with Virgin Group, offering financial incentives to members for healthy behavior, such as regular exercise.

On November 16, 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Humana Inc. partnered to expand on traditional private-sector approaches to population health management.

In 2010, Humana bought Texas-based Concentra Inc., which owns urgent-care and physical therapy centers, for $790 million, effectively returning to healthcare services. In May 2011, Humana announced it would be using mobileStorm to transmit protected health information to patients.

In March 2015, Humana announced the sale of Concentra to private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe and Select Medical Holdings Corporation for about $1 billion, with proceeds to fund a &quot;$2 billion share buyback program and other corporate spending.&quot;

In July 2015, Aetna announced that it would acquire Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock (approximately $230 a share at that time). Aetna and Humana shareholders would own 74% and 26% of the new combined company, however the merger was blocked by a federal judge in January 2017. In February 2017, Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. quashed a $34 billion merger agreement after judges ruled against the merger for a second time.

In July 2018, Humana joined two private equity firms in the acquisition of Kindred Healthcare. The deal provided Humana with a 40% stake in the company&#x27;s home health, hospice and community care businesses, called &quot;Kindred at Home,&quot; for approximately $800 million. In August 2018, Humana announced the creation of a digital health and analytics division called Humana Studio H.

In December 2019, the company announced it would acquire Enclara Healthcare from Consonance Capital Partners and Enclara management.

In 2021, Susan Diamond, formerly occupying an interim position, was announced to be the new permanent CFO. Her appointment to the position comes with the company&#x27;s focus being turned towards the home healthcare business, acquiring in April of the same year a 60% stake in Kindred at Home, an in-home care and hospice business.

In April 2022, it was announced Humana would sell a 60% interest of its Kindred at Home division to the private investment company, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, for US$2.8 billion.

In February 2023, Humana announced they were exiting the employer-based commercial group insurance market. 

==Corporate affairs==

===Sponsorship===
Humana is the presenting sponsor of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; and the National Senior Games.

Since 1979, Humana has been a principal sponsor of the annual Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Kentucky.

LPGA player Nancy Scranton was a spokesperson for Humana. In the past, PGA Tour player David Toms&#x27; David Toms Foundation has partnered with the Humana Foundation to provide grants to several children&#x27;s charities in New Orleans. Humana is the official health benefits provider of the PGA Tour and Champions Tour.

The Humana Distaff Handicap is a Grade 1 race for thoroughbred fillies and mares, four-years-old and up. The race is run each spring on Kentucky Derby day at Churchill Downs and set at a distance of 7 furlongs for a purse of $250,000.

===Humana Military Healthcare Services===
In 1993, Humana founded Humana Military Healthcare Services (HMHS) as a wholly owned subsidiary. They were awarded their first TRICARE contract in 1995, and began serving military beneficiaries in 1996.
From 2004 to 2009, HMHS was the managed care contractor for the Department of Defense Military Health System TRICARE South Region.

In 2009, HMHS&#x27; Managed Care Support Contract was awarded to United Military and Veterans Services, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. HMHS protested that decision and the Government Accountability Office upheld the protest in late 2009.

In 2011, HMHS regained the five-year contract to administer medical benefits to military members and families in the South region, a contract worth $23.5 billion. In 2018, this was moved to the new TRICARE East region during the TRICARE regional realignment.

On December 22, 2022, the Department of Defense announced the award of the managed care support contract for the TRICARE East Region to Humana Military.

==Legal campaign against drug price fixing==

Humana filed a lawsuit in August 2019, alleging that 37 defendants engaged in a “far-reaching conspiracy” to “blatantly fix the price” of generic drugs. This follows a similar smaller lawsuit from October 2018.

==Controversy==
In 1987, Humana sued NBC over a story line in the television medical drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in which the hospital was to be sold to a for-profit medical corporation and renamed &quot;Ecumena&quot;, with subsequent changes to the hospital, both positive and negative, emanating from that change. The company claimed that the program infringed on the Humana trademark. Humana failed to block the airing of the show, but was successful at forcing NBC into showing a disclaimer at the beginning of the September 30 episode saying that the drama had no connection whatsoever with Humana.

On May 30, 1996, Linda Peeno, a physician who was contracted to work for Humana for nine months, testified before Congress as to the downside of managed care. Peeno said she was effectively rewarded by her employer for causing the death of a patient, because it saved the company a half-million dollars. Peeno stated that she felt the &quot;managed care&quot; model was inherently unethical.

In 1999, season one of Michael Moore&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; reported on Humana refusing to pay for a diabetic patient with pancreatic failure needing a transplant. The man&#x27;s policy stated it covered all of his diabetes-related expenses, but another section of the policy stated that it did not cover organ transplants. Moore conducted a fake funeral on the front steps of the Humana building, and three days later Humana changed its policy and authorized the man&#x27;s treatment. 

Michael Moore&#x27;s 2007 documentary &quot;Sicko&quot; used the video of Linda Peeno&#x27;s testimony. On June 28, 2007, Humana declared that Peeno was never a Humana &quot;associate&quot; (permanent, full-time employee), but rather a &quot;part-time contractor.&quot; Humana disputed portions of her Congressional testimony by saying that because the patient&#x27;s healthcare plan did not cover heart transplants, denial of coverage was valid.

On September 21, 2009, the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services opened an investigation into Humana for sending flyers to Medicare recipients that the AARP characterized as deceptive. The mail was made to appear to contain official information about Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, but instead alleged that core Medicare benefits could be cut by the Obama administration&#x27;s healthcare reform, a claim refuted by John Rother, AARP&#x27;s executive vice president. Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), supported the claim that Medicare benefits could be cut, but his comments were in reference to just one of several congressional bills. CBO estimates of another healthcare reform bill found that changes to premiums would vary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services instructed Humana to cease all such mailings to Medicare plan members pending an investigation. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in a letter to the insurance industry, threatened that bad actors may be excluded from new health insurance markets that were to open in 2014. Senate Republicans pointed out in a letter to Sebelius that a 1997 directive from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explicitly allowed HMOs to tell members about legislation and urge them to express opinions.

<text>ʻĀinahau was the royal estate of Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

== History ==
ʻĀinahau was located at the ʻili (traditional subdivision) of ʻAuʻaukai, the ahupuaʻa of Waikīkī, on the island of Oʻahu. At the time, the site was four miles outside of the city of Honolulu. In 1872, Scottish businessman Archibald Scott Cleghorn purchased 6 acres at ʻAuʻaukai from two Hawaiians named Maʻaua and Koihala. Cleghorn&#x27;s wife became Princess Likelike upon her brother&#x27;s ascension as King Kalākaua in 1874.

After the 1875 birth of their daughter Kaʻiulani, her godmother Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani gifted her 3.9 acres and later an additional 1.3 acres at a later date. These lands were inherited from Princess Ruth&#x27;s father Kekūanaōʻa. Princess Likelike named the estate ʻĀinahau (cool land) after the cool winds blowing down from the Manoa Valley and composed a song about her new home. Hawaiian linguist Mary Kawena Pukui claimed that the name means &quot;hau tree land&quot; or &quot;land of the hau tree&quot;, after the hau trees (Hibiscus tiliaceus) growing along the ʻĀpuakēhau Stream which gave shade to the estate. The confusion is due to the fact that hau means both cool and the hibiscus tree in Hawaiian.

ʻĀinahau was initially a country estate while family lived in a mansion on Emma Street in downtown Honolulu, where Kaʻiulani was born. Her father sold the Emma Street residence to Scots-Irish industrialist James Campbell in 1878 and relocated the family to the country estate.

Cleghorn built a two-story home on the estate. It was furnished with two grand pianos, elaborate brocade chairs, gold and glass cabinets and fixtures. Also, there were various art collections displayed on the walls and rooms. From ʻĀinahau, the Cleghorn family would entertain Hawaiʻi&#x27;s prestigious social circles.

Cleghorn collected flowers and trees from all over the world, planted in various gardens on the estate. These included date palms, Washington palms, mango and teak trees, Monterey cypress, cinnamon and croton trees, and other types of trees. He also planted fourteen types of hibiscus, Princess Likelike&#x27;s favorite gardenia flowers and Kaʻiulani&#x27;s signature flower, the pikake or Jasmine flowers. A large banyan tree in front of the main house became known as the Kaʻiulani&#x27;s banyan, which was the progenitor of all later banyan trees in Honolulu.

A stable was built for several horses, including quarters for Kaʻiulani&#x27;s prized pony named Fairy. ʻĀinahau was made famous in later years for its many peacocks that roamed freely on its grounds. Kaʻiulani would be called the &quot;Princess of Peacocks&quot; in legend.

Kaʻiulani became mistress of ʻĀinahau at the age of 12, upon the death of her mother Princess Likelike. As mistress of ʻĀinahau, she grew fond of the company of the Scottish poet and author Robert Louis Stevenson, who stayed at ʻĀinahau over the course of Kaʻiualani&#x27;s childhood.

The estate was sold in 1917 and subdivided after plans to turn it into a park fell through. The house burned down in 1921 due to what was thought to be a gas leak.

The site was later developed by the owners of the Moana Hotel, located across Kalākaua Avenue, which had been built towards the end of Kaʻiulani&#x27;s life. In 1925, wood frame bungalows for the Moana were constructed on the site of ʻĀinahau. The bungalows were demolished in 1953 and the Matson Line constructed the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, which opened on 11 June 1955. The 11-story building was the tallest in Hawaii at the time.

In 1959, Matson sold their hotels to Sheraton Hotels. They added a second wing to the successful Princess Kaiulani Hotel in 1960, with 210 additional rooms. The hotel was sold to Kyo-Ya Company Limited in July 1963, though Sheraton continued to operate it. Kyo-Ya added a third wing, the 29-story Ainahau Tower, in 1970. Later in the 1970s, they renamed the hotel the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel.

<text>The label &quot;non-institutional&quot; refers to a distinct fellowship within the Churches of Christ who do not agree with the support of parachurch organizations (colleges, orphans&#x27; homes, organized mission efforts, etc.) by local congregations. They contend that the New Testament includes no authority for churches&#x27; support of such institutions. Instead they feel that it is a responsibility and duty of the individual members to assist those in need. Similarly, most non-institutional congregations also oppose the use of church facilities for non-church activities (such as fellowship dinners or recreation); as such, they oppose the construction of &quot;fellowship halls&quot;, gymnasiums, and similar structures. The belief is that, although such activities may be beneficial, they are not a proper function of a local congregation.

These local churches became separated from &quot;mainline&quot; (pro-institutional) churches of Christ because of these viewpoints, developing into a distinct segment of congregations by the 1960s. Whether a congregation supports the &quot;sponsoring church&quot; custom is one way to distinguish between the &quot;non-institutional&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot; congregations. The congregations that advocate financial support or the pooling of resources for the benefit of other entities or organized external evangelical efforts are sometimes called &quot;sponsoring churches&quot; and identified as &quot;mainstream.&quot;

==Membership==
This fellowship of non-institutional congregations, which intentionally forgoes any para-congregational organizational structure, is estimated at 120,000 members, accounting for around 9% of the members of Churches of Christ in the United States and for about 15% of congregations.

==Identification==
These congregations generally accept the description &quot;non-institutional&quot;, although they do not officially identify as such on signs, letterhead, or other official documents; some consider pejorative the epithet &quot;anti&quot; with which they have been called by some in the usually larger mainstream Churches of Christ since the 1950s and 1960s, and likewise the similar term, &quot;non-cooperative&quot;. Both groups identify as belonging to the original church started by Christ. The 19th-century Restoration Movement resulted in an increase in the number of U.S. members.

While the one-cup, non-class, and mutual edification congregations are almost always non-institutional, they became independent from the mainstream well before the broader 1950s division among congregations over institutions.

==Common beliefs==
Individual churches of Christ are autonomous congregations (without hierarchical central governance, nondenominational), so doctrinal positions vary between congregations. Examples include whether or not to &#x27;corporately&#x27; sponsor a youth outing or have auxiliary facilities like a study room or kitchen on church grounds. In general, these churches subscribe to the more conservative positions associated with churches of Christ in matters of authority, organization, and worship. Most congregations in this number can be differentiated from mainstream churches by a differentiation of the role of the individual Christian and the congregation.

As a result, they oppose the following practices that became widespread in other churches of Christ during the mid-twentieth century, namely:

* Support from the church treasury for institutions such as Bible colleges or orphans&#x27; homes. Members of non-institutional churches note a distinction between the work assigned to the individual Christian and that assigned to the local congregation collectively (citing passages such as ). While individuals are charged to &quot;do good to all men,&quot; (), they believe that churches are explicitly assigned a limited number of duties (usually defined as evangelism, edification, and benevolence, the latter generally being limited to only members of a specific congregation, their family members, and/or missionaries supported by the congregation). They oppose a church giving its collective funds to an outside institution or setting up another under its control to do work which they believe the apostles assigned to the individual. For example, while they would refuse to give church funds to an orphans&#x27; home or soup kitchen, non-institutional churches would encourage individual members to help such causes.
* Churches pooling resources to perform work under the oversight of a single congregation or outside institution. Critics opposed to this practice say such cooperation did not exist in the first century churches and violates the autonomy of the local congregation. They note that the New Testament writings recorded that congregations sometimes sent aid to each other, but they say this practice was always from a single congregation to a single congregation for the benefit of members of the latter. No other arrangement for transfer of funds between churches appears in the New Testament. Thus, members of a non-institutional church would not authorize giving church funds to a missionary society or undertake a &quot;sponsoring church&quot; arrangement. A non-institutional church may send money to an individual preacher, as there are New Testament examples of this (; ; ).
* Church relief for non-Christians (some members define this term as those persons outside the church of Christ), especially as an evangelism tool. Critics of such aid say that every New Testament example of support of needy individuals by churches was of support of fellow Christians. They encourage individual members to seek out and personally help any persons in need, but say the church should provide support only to those it recognizes as faithful and needy Christians, per the New Testament examples. They do not consider &quot;the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all&quot; to be an example, believing that &quot;all&quot; means &quot;all saints&quot; as opposed to &quot;all people&quot;.
* A church kitchen or &quot;fellowship hall,&quot; as well as other forms of church-sponsored social activity. Distinguishing between the work of the church and that of individuals, members of non-institutional churches hold that social activity was an individual practice. They believe there is no example in the New Testament of church funds being used to build a kitchen and eating facility, or to finance social activities. They encourage members to develop social activities with personal funds. In addition, they say the language of forbids the eating of a common meal as a work of the church.

==History==
The diversity among autonomous congregations makes it difficult to document their history, either individually or as a group of common interest. Most activity is either the action of an individual congregation (and thus local in scope) or the activity of individuals separate from churches (and thus technically not an act of the churches as institutions). Their activities have been noted through issues that bring about debate and division. Non-institutional churches have faced two major issues in the past century: institutionalism and marriage, divorce, and remarriage.

===Division over institutionalism===
The lack of denominational infrastructure leaves a vacuum for inter-congregational discourse among Churches of Christ, one that often has been filled by publications and extra-church institutions such as colleges. These organizations, though overseen and run by members of Churches of Christ, were usually considered the work of individual Christians separate from the churches themselves. Among &quot;brotherhood papers&quot; in the mid-twentieth century, the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; and &quot;Firm Foundation&quot; were the oldest and most influential. Among colleges, the largest were Abilene Christian College, Pepperdine, Freed-Hardeman College, David Lipscomb College, and Harding College.

Prior to World War II, the practice of local church support for outside institutions (mostly colleges) was uncommon in churches of Christ, but not unheard of. Such arrangements tended to be kept quiet, and the Bible colleges loosely associated with churches of Christ always denied they lobbied churches for money. These denials helped to defuse dissension over the issue, as most objectors were loath to interfere with church autonomy.

====First rumblings====
In the 1930s, however, some men began actively promoting church funding of Bible colleges. The most prominent of these was G. C. Brewer, who throughout the decade engaged in a running debate with various people on the issue. He had begun advancing his theories in a speech at the 1931 Abilene Christian College Lectures. In 1933, he had written a series of articles in the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; arguing that churches should support educational institutions and charities from their treasuries. He continued this line of argumentation throughout the decade.

Finally, Brewer&#x27;s unscripted remarks in support of church funding for colleges at the 1938 Abilene Christian College lectures provoked great controversy. Several writers, such as Foy E. Wallace, Jr. and W. W. Otey, wrote and spoke in opposition to Brewer; Otey&#x27;s 1938 article in &quot;Firm Foundation&quot; included statements from leaders of colleges that they &quot;regretted&quot; Brewer&#x27;s statements. Publicly, Brewer&#x27;s position received little support; privately, however, prominent men such as B. C. Goodpasture, N. B. Hardeman, and Robert M. Alexander agreed with the proposition, though most were noncommital when asked specifically about their position. World War II largely suspended the debate, as the question of pacifism took center stage in &quot;brotherhood papers.&quot; However, division had not been prevented, only postponed.

====The aftermath of World War II====
After the conclusion of World War II, several factors worked together to bring the institutional question back to the foreground.

First, many of the previous generation of perceived leaders (such as Daniel Sommer, J. D. Tant, Joe Warlick, and F. B. Srygley) had died, leaving others with different beliefs and dispositions to take their place. The most notable of these was Goodpasture, who had ascended to be editor of the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; in 1939; he is generally regarded as the most influential figure among Churches of Christ at this time.

Also, the Depression and war had led to lower enrollment at many Bible colleges; this in turn caused many of the colleges to postpone expansion and even maintenance. However, the G.I. Bill brought with it an influx of enrollment at these colleges. Bible colleges thus found themselves in need of immediate funds to renovate and expand to meet a swelling demand.

Finally, evangelism in Europe became possible after the war. However, the expense involved was considerable. As a result, some congregations and individuals began experimenting with various methods of congregational cooperation. The most notable of these was the &quot;sponsoring church&quot; arrangement, where one congregation oversees a project using resources pooled from other congregations. The best-known of these efforts was the &quot;Herald of Truth&quot;, a nationwide radio program begun by the Highland Church of Christ in Abilene, Texas, in 1952.

====Controversy and division erupt====
The issue of church support for institutions arose anew quickly after the war. Many of those who had been silent before now saw much to gain by raising the issue. No longer was it a mere hypothetical question, but one where a strict interpretation of congregational independence and separation of the individual and the church would, in their estimation, lead to lost opportunities.

The pro-institutional camp learned from the experience of the 1930s and the tepid support for sending money to colleges from the church treasury. They tried a different tactic, tying church support of colleges with church support of other institutions, namely orphans&#x27; homes. As N. B. Hardeman wrote in &quot;Firm Foundation&quot; in 1947, &quot;I have always believed that a church has the right to contribute to a school or an orphanage if it so desired... The same principle that permits one must also permit the other. They must stand or fall together.&quot; This statement serves as a summary statement of the &quot;institutional&quot; or &quot;mainline&quot; position.

The addition of the emotional element of &quot;starving orphans&quot; proved successful at persuading many who had been on the fence to the institutional side during the 1950s. However, it also led to rancor; what had previously been a largely civil debate erupted into name-calling and bitter dissension. Those who objected to churches funding private institutions were often referred to as &quot;orphan haters&quot;, &quot;Pharisees,&quot; and the like; for their part, non-institutionals such as Foy E. Wallace, Jr. returned (and at times initiated) the rhetorical fire. Well-known preachers with ties to the colleges became increasingly assertive in condemning anyone who disagreed. Accusations of coercion and intimidation swirled around the colleges. Those with outside businesses, particularly on the non-institutional side, often found themselves facing boycotts organized by those opposing their position.

The leading voices of the institutional movement were men such as G. C. Brewer, N. B. Hardeman, Robert M. Alexander, and B. C. Goodpasture. The non-institutional side of the debate was led by men such as Foy E. Wallace Jr., Roy Cogdill, and Fanning Yater Tant. From the beginning, the non-institutional side found itself outmaneuvered by the institutionals, who held the reins of power at all the large Bible colleges and the most popular of publications. It was not aided by infighting between the various proponents, climaxing in the 1951 split of the Fourth and Groesbeck Church of Christ in Lufkin, Texas, leading to two congregations, one with Cogdill as preacher, the other with Wallace&#x27;s brother Cled preaching. Foy Wallace, the most polarizing figure in the debate, thereafter ceased arguing for a non-institutional position; indeed, by the mid-1960s, he associated himself exclusively with institutional churches.

Late 1954 provided two factors key to the developing split. First, in October, G. H. P. Showalter, the editor of &quot;Firm Foundation&quot;, died and was replaced by Reuel Lemmons. The paper had in previous years stood opposed to the colleges on many matters and had positioned itself under Showalter as a place for balanced debate. Under Lemmons, however, the paper took an increasingly pro-institutional position.

The second, and more important, action was publicized in the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; in December of that year. Goodpasture called for a &quot;yellow tag of quarantine&quot; to be imposed upon any who espoused the non-institutional position. The historian David Edwin Harrell contrasted B. C. Goodpasture with the &quot;fighting style&quot; of Foy Wallace: &quot;Foy Wallace scorched heretics; Goodpasture warned them they would lose their position within the brotherhood.&quot; Goodpasture&#x27;s political style led him &quot;to cut his losses and to consolidate his assets,&quot; in the words of historian Richard Hughes. He recommended expelling non-institutional members from existing congregations, firing preachers who took this position and cancelling their meetings at institutional churches, and blackballing congregations that resisted conforming to institutionalism. The institutional movement turned from persuasion to isolation of its opponents.

Across the next decade, bitter division erupted in Churches of Christ throughout the nation. Debates were held over the issues, though usually positions had already hardened beyond persuasion. Preachers suspected of taking positions at odds with the leadership were ordered to publicly refute said position as a condition of employment; the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; became a forum for some better-known preachers to recant publicly previous positions opposing institutionalism. Some churches were forced to make token donations to institutions in order to avoid being called &quot;anti&#x27;s.&quot; Conflict sometimes ended in fistfights. Members who espoused a minority position in a congregation were expelled. Lawsuits over building ownership followed from some of these divisions. Exiles often banded together to form new congregations; some rural communities today are home to two or more small Churches of Christ as the legacy of this division.

By the end of the 1960s, the isolation of non-institutionals from the mainstream churches was concluded. Contact between churches and individuals across the divide essentially ended. Members of both branches practiced the beliefs which they held were the only correct ones.

===Aftermath of the division===
Most non-institutional churches had to rebuild in the 1960s and 1970s, as in most instances, they had lost buildings, positions, and jobs as a result of the division. They were united by their beliefs during this period. The most significant discussion of this time reflected the &quot;unity in diversity&quot; debate taking place in institutional churches; but it was little accepted in the more conservative non-institutional branch. Men such as Carl Ketcherside and Edward Fudge preached this message.

Most within non-institutional churches refer to themselves as &quot;conservative&quot; churches of Christ and refer to the Bible college-supporting, &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;sponsoring church&quot; congregations as &quot;liberal,&quot; which leads to some confusion since the &quot;mainline&quot; churches use the terms &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; to refer to two separate strands within their own congregations. Many in the non-institutional congregations are not aware that institutional congregations have their own differences, and consider them all as &quot;liberal.&quot; Many in the institutional congregations do not know the history or existence of the non-institutional groups.

Of the colleges connected with the churches of Christ, Florida College is the only one associated with the non-institutional churches, although this relationship is informal, as it does not accept funds from churches.

In 2009, non-institutional churches of Christ comprised 113,656 members across 1,898 congregations.

=== Attempts at unity ===
Over the years, several attempts have been made to achieve unity between non-institutional congregations and those described as main-stream. A more recent reconciliation attempt involved a series of discussions that took place on November 15, 2019, in Dickson, Tennessee, at Freed-Hardeman University&#x27;s Renaissance Center. Doug Burleson, Associate Professor in Bible at Freed-Hardeman University and Assistant Dean of the College of Biblical Studies, and Kyle Pope, who preaches for the Olsen Park Church of Christ in Amarillo, Texas, sat down for an informal series of &quot;living room conversations.&quot; During this event, both parties discussed their understanding of biblical principles regarding benevolence, treasuries, and institutions. Although no formal agreement was found, it showed the potential of unity for the first time since the 1950s. In October 2019 editions of both &quot;Truth Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Gospel Advocate&quot; included six articles discussing the underlying Biblical questions surrounding institutionalism; Burleson and Pope each contributed three articles.

<doc id="699403" wikidata="Q2407534" url="?curid=699403" title="Preamble to the United States Constitution">
<text>The Preamble to the United States Constitution, beginning with the words We the People, is a brief introductory statement of the Constitution&#x27;s fundamental purposes and guiding principles. Courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of the Founding Fathers&#x27; intentions regarding the Constitution&#x27;s meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve.

The preamble was mainly written by Gouverneur Morris, a Pennsylvania delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention held at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

==Text==

==Drafting==
The Preamble was placed in the Constitution during the last days of the Constitutional Convention by the Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft, with Gouverneur Morris leading the effort. It was not proposed or discussed on the floor of the convention beforehand. The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of &quot;the United States&quot;; rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm. 

In earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognizing American independence, the word &quot;people&quot; was not used, and the phrase &quot;the United States&quot; was followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south. The change was made out of necessity, as the Constitution provided that, whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ratified.

==Meaning and application==
The Preamble serves solely as an introduction and does not assign powers to the federal government, nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. Due to the Preamble&#x27;s limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication, except as regards frivolous litigation.

===Judicial relevance===
The courts have shown interest in any clues they can find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution&#x27;s meaning. Courts have developed several techniques for interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution. As a result, the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a document should be used in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution. Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the document from more than just the wording; the Preamble is also useful for these efforts to identify the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Constitution.

Additionally, when interpreting a legal document, courts are usually interested in understanding the document as its authors did and their motivations for creating it; as a result, the courts have cited the Preamble for evidence of the history, intent and meaning of the Constitution as it was understood by the Founders. Although revolutionary in some ways, the Constitution maintained many common law concepts (such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, trial by jury, and sovereign immunity), and courts deem that the Founders&#x27; perceptions of the legal system that the Constitution created (i.e., the interaction between what it changed and what it kept from the British legal system) are uniquely important because of the authority &quot;the People&quot; invested them with to create it. Along with evidence of the understandings of the men who debated and drafted the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention, the courts are also interested in the way that government officials have put into practice the Constitution&#x27;s provisions, particularly early government officials, although the courts reserve to themselves the final authority to determine the Constitution&#x27;s meaning. However, this focus on historical understandings of the Constitution is sometimes in tension with the changed circumstances of modern society from the late 18th century society that drafted the Constitution; courts have ruled that the Constitution must be interpreted in light of these changed circumstances. All of these considerations of the political theory behind the Constitution have prompted the Supreme Court to articulate a variety of special rules of construction and principles for interpreting it. For example, the Court&#x27;s rendering of the purposes behind the Constitution have led it to express a preference for broad interpretations of individual freedoms.

=== Examples ===
An example of the way courts utilize the Preamble is &quot;Ellis v. City of Grand Rapids&quot;. Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use eminent domain to force landowners to sell property in the city identified as &quot;blighted&quot;, and convey the property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment, which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a &quot;public use&quot;. In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a &quot;public use&quot;, the court pointed to the Preamble&#x27;s reference to &quot;promot[ing] the general Welfare&quot; as evidence that &quot;[t]he health of the people was in the minds of our forefathers&quot;. &quot;[T]he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care centers, as a part of our nation&#x27;s system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest meaning of such terms. &quot;Surely this is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution: &#x27;* * * promote the general Welfare.&quot;

On the other hand, courts will not interpret the Preamble to give the government powers that are not articulated elsewhere in the Constitution. &quot;United States v. Kinnebrew Motor Co.&quot; is an example of this. In that case, the defendants were a car manufacturer and dealership indicted for a criminal violation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Congress passed the statute in order to cope with the Great Depression, and one of its provisions purported to give to the President authority to fix &quot;the prices at which new cars may be sold&quot;. The dealership, located in Oklahoma City, had sold an automobile to a customer (also from Oklahoma City) for less than the price for new cars fixed pursuant to the Act. Substantively, the case was about whether the transaction in question constituted &quot;interstate commerce&quot; that Congress could regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Although the government argued that the scope of the Commerce Clause included this transaction, it also argued that the Preamble&#x27;s statement that the Constitution was created to &quot;promote the general Welfare&quot; should be understood to permit Congress to regulate transactions such as the one in this case, particularly in the face of an obvious national emergency like the Great Depression. The court, however, dismissed this argument as erroneous and insisted that the only relevant issue was whether the transaction that prompted the indictment actually constituted &quot;interstate commerce&quot; under the Supreme Court&#x27;s precedents that interpreted the scope of the Commerce Clause.

===Interpretation===

====Aspects of national sovereignty====
The Preamble&#x27;s reference to the &quot;United States of America&quot; has been interpreted over the years to explain the nature of the governmental entity that the Constitution created (i.e., the federal government). In contemporary international law, the world consists of sovereign states (or &quot;sovereign nations&quot; in modern equivalent). A state is said to be &quot;sovereign&quot; if any of its ruling inhabitants are the supreme authority over it; the concept is distinct from mere land-title or &quot;ownership.&quot; While each state was originally recognized as sovereign unto itself, the Supreme Court held that the &quot;United States of America&quot; consists of only one sovereign nation with respect to foreign affairs and international relations; the individual states may not conduct foreign relations. Although the Constitution expressly delegates to the federal government only some of the usual powers of sovereign governments (such as the powers to declare war and make treaties), all such powers inherently belong to the federal government as the country&#x27;s representative in the international community.

Domestically, the federal government&#x27;s sovereignty means that it may perform acts such as entering into contracts or accepting bonds, which are typical of governmental entities but not expressly provided for in the Constitution or laws. Similarly, the federal government, as an attribute of sovereignty, has the power to enforce those powers that are granted to it (e.g., the power to &quot;establish Post Offices and Post Roads&quot; includes the power to punish those who interfere with the postal system so established). The Court has recognized the federal government&#x27;s supreme power over those limited matters entrusted to it. Thus, no state may interfere with the federal government&#x27;s operations as though its sovereignty is superior to the federal government&#x27;s (discussed more below); for example, states may not interfere with the federal government&#x27;s near absolute discretion to sell its own real property, even when that real property is located in one or another state. The federal government exercises its supreme power not as a unitary entity, but instead via the three coordinate branches of the government (legislative, executive, and judicial), each of which has its own prescribed powers and limitations under the Constitution. In addition, the doctrine of separation of powers functions as a limitation on each branch of the federal government&#x27;s exercise of sovereign power.

One aspect of the American system of government is that, while the rest of the world now views the United States as one country, domestically American constitutional law recognizes a federation of state governments separate from (and not subdivisions of) the federal government, each of which is sovereign over its own affairs. Sometimes, the Supreme Court has even analogized the States to being foreign countries to each other to explain the American system of State sovereignty. However, each state&#x27;s sovereignty is limited by the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of both the United States as a nation and each state; in the event of a conflict, a valid federal law controls. As a result, although the federal government is (as discussed above) recognized as sovereign and has supreme power over those matters within its control, the American constitutional system also recognizes the concept of &quot;State sovereignty&quot;, where certain matters are susceptible to government regulation, but only at the State and not the federal level. For example, although the federal government prosecutes crimes against the United States (such as treason, or interference with the postal system), the general administration of criminal justice is reserved to the States. Notwithstanding sometimes broad statements by the Supreme Court regarding the &quot;supreme&quot; and &quot;exclusive&quot; powers the State and Federal governments exercise, the Supreme Court and State courts have also recognized that much of their power is held and exercised concurrently.

====People of the United States====
The phrase &quot;People of the United States&quot; has been understood to mean &quot;nationals and citizens.&quot; This approach reasons that, if the political community speaking for itself in the Preamble (&quot;&quot;We&quot; the People&quot;) includes only U.S. nationals and citizens, by negative implication it specifically excludes non-citizens in some way. It has also been construed to mean something like &quot;all under the sovereign jurisdiction and authority of the United States.&quot; The phrase has been construed as affirming that the national government created by the Constitution derives its sovereignty from the people, (whereas &quot;United Colonies&quot; had identified external monarchical sovereignty) as well as confirming that the government under the Constitution was intended to govern and protect &quot;the people&quot; directly, as one society, instead of governing only the states as political units. The Court has also understood this language to mean that the sovereignty of the government under the U.S. Constitution is superior to that of the States. Stated in negative terms, the Preamble has been interpreted as meaning that the Constitution was not the act of sovereign and independent states.

====The popular nature of the Constitution====

The Constitution claims to be an act of &quot;We the People.&quot; However, because it represents a general social contract, there are limits on the ability of individual citizens to pursue legal claims allegedly arising out of the Constitution. For example, if a law were enacted which violated the Constitution, not just anybody could challenge the statute&#x27;s constitutionality in court; instead, only an individual who was negatively affected by the unconstitutional statute could bring such a challenge. For example, a person claiming certain benefits that are created by a statute cannot then challenge, on constitutional grounds, the administrative mechanism that awards them. These same principles apply to corporate entities, and can implicate the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies.

In this same vein, courts will not answer hypothetical questions about the constitutionality of a statute. The judiciary does not have the authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws &quot;solely&quot; because they are unconstitutional, but may declare a law unconstitutional if its operation would injure a person&#x27;s interests. For example, creditors who lose some measure of what they are owed when a bankrupt&#x27;s debts are discharged cannot claim injury, because Congress&#x27; power to enact bankruptcy laws is also in the Constitution and inherent in it is the ability to declare certain debts valueless. Similarly, while a person may not generally challenge as unconstitutional a law that they are not accused of violating, once charged, a person may challenge the law&#x27;s validity, even if the challenge is unrelated to the circumstances of the crime.

====Where the Constitution is legally effective====
The Preamble has been used to confirm that the Constitution was made for, and is binding only in, the United States of America. For example, in &quot;Casement v. Squier&quot;, a serviceman in China during World War II was convicted of murder in the United States Court for China. After being sent to prison in the State of Washington, he filed a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; with the local federal court, claiming he had been unconstitutionally put on trial without a jury. The court held that, since his trial was conducted by an American court and was, by American standards, basically fair, he was not entitled to the specific constitutional right of trial by jury while overseas.

The Supreme Court held in 1901 that since the Preamble declares the Constitution to have been created by the &quot;People of the United States&quot;, &quot;there may be places within the jurisdiction of the United States that are no part of the Union.&quot; The following examples help demonstrate the meaning of this distinction:
* &quot;Geofroy v. Riggs&quot;, : the Supreme Court held that a certain treaty between the United States and France which was applicable in &quot;the States of the Union&quot; was also applicable in Washington, D.C., even though it is not a state or a part of a state.
* &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot;, : the Supreme Court ruled that a customs collector could not, under a statute providing for taxes on imported goods, collect taxes on goods coming from Puerto Rico after it had been ceded to the United States from Spain, reasoning that although it was not a State, it was under the jurisdiction of U.S. sovereignty, and thus the goods were not being imported from a foreign country. However, in &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, , the Court held that the Congress could constitutionally enact a statute taxing goods sent from Puerto Rico to ports in the United States differently from other commerce, in spite of the constitutional requirement that &quot;all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States,&quot; on the theory that although Puerto Rico could not be treated as a foreign country, it did not count as part of the &quot;United States&quot; and thus was not guaranteed &quot;uniform&quot; tax treatment by that clause of the Constitution. This was not the only constitutional clause held not to apply in Puerto Rico: later, a lower court went on to hold that goods brought from Puerto Rico into New York before the enactment of the tax statute held constitutional in &quot;Downes&quot;, could retroactively have the taxes applied to them notwithstanding the Constitution&#x27;s ban on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, even if at the time they were brought into the United States no tax could be applied to the goods because Puerto Rico was not a foreign country.
* &quot;Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales&quot;, : the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s requirement that &quot;no person shall ... be deprived of ... property, without due process of law&quot; was held, by the Supreme Court, to apply in Puerto Rico, even though it was not a State and thus not &quot;part&quot; of the United States.

====To form a more perfect Union====
The phrase &quot;to form a more perfect Union&quot; has been construed as referring to the shift to the Constitution from the Articles of Confederation. The contemporaneous meaning of the word &quot;perfect&quot; was complete, finished, fully informed, confident, or certain. The phrase has been interpreted in various ways throughout history based on the context of the times. For example, shortly after the Civil War and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court said that the &quot;Union&quot; was made &quot;more perfect&quot; by the creation of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens, rather than a government with narrowly limited power that could act on citizens only indirectly through the states, e.g., by imposing taxes. Also, the institution was created as a government over the States and people, not an agreement (union) between the States.

In the 21st century, following a pivotal, widely reported speech entitled &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot; by then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, the phrase has also come to mean the continual process of improvement of the country. 

The phrase has also been interpreted to support the federal supremacy clause as well as to demonstrate that state nullification of any federal law, dissolution of the Union, or secession from it, are not contemplated by the Constitution.

<doc id="699406" wikidata="Q885963" url="?curid=699406" title="Martin L. Davey">
<text>Martin Luther Davey (July 25, 1884March 31, 1946) was an American Democratic politician from Ohio. After serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, he served as the 53rd governor of Ohio.

==Childhood==
Davey was born in Kent, Ohio, in 1884. His father was John Davey, better known as the tree doctor and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company. His mother was Bertha Reeves, the daughter of a minister. Martin was one of seven children. His sister Mary and another sibling died before reaching maturity. His surviving siblings were Belle, Wellington, James (Jim), and Paul.

Their family struggled with money, leading the young Martin to start making and selling his own horseradish as a child. All of the profits from this went to help his family. He also helped with his father’s farm and greenhouse. He was an excellent salesman, developing friendships with his customers.

He attended a country fair where he heard the famous &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech given by William Jennings Bryan. This led to him wanting to be a politician.

==Education==
Davey graduated from Kent High School in Kent, Ohio. After graduating high school, he worked for a time for the Oliver Typewriter Company in Cleveland, Ohio. He made $10.00 a week plus commission. He was an excellent salesman, and soon earned $200.00 a month. He decided to continue his education and attended Oberlin College, where he played football and was on the track team. He was third in his class, when he stopped his education to help found the family business. He returned to school for a time, until he met and married his wife. The marriage and birth of their first child ended his school career.

==Political career==
Davey was elected mayor of Kent, serving from 1913 to 1918. In 1918, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives to fill the term of Elsworth R. Bathrick. He was re-elected in November, but lost another bid for re-election in 1920. He was re-elected in 1922, 1924 and 1926. In 1928, Davey ran for governor, but was defeated. He ran again in 1934, and won two two-year terms before being defeated in a bid for renomination in 1938 by Charles W. Sawyer. He was the Democratic nominee for governor in 1940, but lost to incumbent Gov. John Bricker.

==Family==
In 1907 Martin married Berenice Chrisman of Kent. They had three children: Evangeline, Mary Bernice, and Martin Luther Jr.

Mary Bernice died in childhood. Evangeline married Alexander M. Smith. Martin L. Jr. went on to work at the family business.

==Legacy==
Davey&#x27;s family was known for their company, The Davey Tree Expert Company (founded 1880), located in Kent, Ohio.

The Davey Beef Building (erected in 1977 but no longer standing) at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, was named in honor of Davey.

<text>William Barron Hilton (October 23, 1927 – September 19, 2019) was an American business magnate, philanthropist and sportsman. The second son and successor of hotelier Conrad Hilton, he was the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels Corporation and chairman emeritus of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Hilton, a notable pilot and outdoorsman, was also a founder of the American Football League as the original owner of the Los Angeles Chargers, and helped forge the merger with the National Football League that created the Super Bowl. Like his father before him, he pledged 97 percent of his wealth to the humanitarian work of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. At the time, the gift was projected to increase the foundation&#x27;s endowment from $2.9 billion to $6.3 billion, and will make his estate the organization&#x27;s most significant donor.

== Early life ==
Hilton was born in Dallas, Texas, to Mary Adelaide (née Barron) and Conrad Nicholson Hilton, founder of Hilton Hotels. Hilton grew up with three siblings, Conrad Nicholson Hilton, Jr., Eric Michael Hilton, and Constance Francesca Hilton. His father was of Norwegian and German descent and from New Mexico while his mother was from Kentucky.

He served in the Navy during World War II as a photographer. As a child, Hilton was fascinated by aviation, and learned to fly when he was 17. After his wartime discharge, he attended the University of Southern California Aeronautical School, where he earned his twin-engine rating at age 19.

== Early career, Los Angeles / San Diego Chargers ==
Before joining his father in the hotel industry, Barron Hilton honed his business skills in a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. He acquired the Los Angeles-area distributorship of Vita-Pakt Citrus Products, co-founded MacDonald Oil Company, and founded Air Finance Corporation, one of the nation&#x27;s first aircraft leasing businesses. In 1954, Barron was elected vice president of Hilton Hotels, running the company&#x27;s franchise operations and creating the Carte Blanche credit card as a service to the company&#x27;s customers.

In 1959, Lamar Hunt offered Hilton the Los Angeles franchise in the new American Football League (AFL). Hilton named his team the Chargers, but denied that he did it to create synergy with his new credit card business. A fan had nominated the name in a contest, and Hilton selected it because of the bugle call and &quot;Charge!&quot; cheer that was often sounded during USC football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Chargers began playing at the Coliseum in 1960, but in spite of winning the Western Division, the club found it difficult to compete for fans with the Rams of the National Football League (NFL) in their own stadium. Hilton moved the team to San Diego in time for the 1961 season and played in tiny Balboa Stadium, which the city had expanded to 30,000 seats.

Hilton began working with the local newspapers to engender support for construction of a state-of-the-art stadium. Encouraged by San Diego Union sports editor Jack Murphy, among others, a referendum was passed in 1965, and the Chargers began play in the new San Diego Stadium in 1967. With the availability of a new stadium, the city received a baseball expansion franchise from the National League, and the San Diego Padres began play in 1969.

Hilton also served as AFL president in 1965, and helped forge the merger between the AFL and the NFL, announced in 1966, which created the Super Bowl. In all, the Chargers won five divisional titles, and one AFL Championship, during Hilton&#x27;s six years at the helm of the club. In 1966, directors of Hilton Hotels Corporation asked Hilton to succeed his father as president and chief executive officer of the company, provided that he drop his football responsibilities. He sold his majority interest in the team for $10 million—a record for any professional sports franchise at the time—after an initial investment in a franchise fee of just $25,000.

With the death of the Bills&#x27; Ralph Wilson in 2014, Hilton became the last surviving member of the Foolish Club—the nickname the original AFL owners gave each other, as they absorbed the start-up expenses and player salaries necessary to compete with the established NFL.

==Hilton Hotels==

Once charged with the responsibility for Hilton Hotels Corporation, Barron Hilton soon showed his father&#x27;s genius for cost controls and real estate deals. In 1970, he convinced the board to expand into Las Vegas by purchasing the International and the Flamingo from financier Kirk Kerkorian. Hilton Hotels thus became the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange to venture into the gaming market. Renamed the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton, the two resorts tapped a new source of income from gambling in a state where it had been legal since 1931. Barron could also see that Las Vegas would become a leading convention destination, capitalizing on the company&#x27;s strength in that important market segment.

Hilton personally introduced two innovations that have become standard features of casinos everywhere. Calling on his background in photography, he installed video cameras throughout the casinos to replace the &quot;eye in the sky&quot; system of observers peering through two-way mirrors in the ceiling.

Las Vegas would also become the self-proclaimed &quot;Entertainment Capital of the World&quot;. Of all the headliners to perform at the Hilton or the Flamingo, the most successful and spectacular were certainly Liberace and Elvis Presley. After a decade in the movies, Elvis Presley again began performing in front of live audiences in 1969 at the opening of the International (a few years later renamed the Las Vegas Hilton). He went on to star at the Las Vegas Hilton two months a year—performing two shows a night, seven nights a week—until shortly before his death in 1977. Presley set a world entertainment record at the Las Vegas Hilton for selling out 837 consecutive concerts.

Having played Las Vegas since 1944, Liberace had created the resident entertainer model on the Las Vegas Strip the year before he befriended Elvis at Presley&#x27;s first, and less-than-successful foray on the Strip in 1956. Liberace was signed by Hilton to the same showroom as Presley beginning in 1972, for an unprecedented $300,000 per week. Barron Hilton was a major influence in pushing Liberace to always outperform his previous shows, with more and more of the entertainer&#x27;s famous brand of showmanship. True to form, Liberace played his last show at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1980, arriving on stage in a classic car, and closing by flying off stage in a 110 lbs. crystal and ostrich feather cape.

The company&#x27;s expansion into Nevada had an immediate impact on its net income. By 1972, the two resorts contributed 45 percent of the company&#x27;s income (before interest income, interest expense, write down of investments and sales of properties), nearly matching the income from the other 160 Hilton hotels in the United States.

On the hotel front, in 1975 Hilton sold a 50 percent interest in six of the company&#x27;s largest hotels to Prudential Insurance Company for $83 million. He took a leaseback to manage the properties, collecting lucrative management fees and a percentage of their gross profits. Perhaps more importantly, the sale proved that these hotels were worth double their book value, demonstrating the underlying value of the company&#x27;s real estate holdings. The transaction also enhanced the value of the stock held by every HHC shareholder. Hilton used the proceeds to pay down high interest debt, and repurchase 20 percent of the company&#x27;s stock—all at market rate—which was still trading well below the company&#x27;s book value.

Hilton continued to expand the domestic hotel chain through franchising and the selective acquisition of management contracts and hotels in emerging markets. In 1977, he completed a hotel purchase that his father had initiated 28 years earlier. When Conrad Hilton bought the Waldorf-Astoria in 1949, he actually bought the hotel&#x27;s operating company and its 30-year lease to run the hotel. The building, and the land under it, were still owned by the realty arm of the Penn Central Railroad. Knowing that the lease would expire in 1979, Hilton deftly negotiated to buy the hotel and real estate from the railroad. The landmark property, whose current value is estimated around $1 billion, was purchased by Hilton for just $35 million. 
As competitors aggressively spread across the U.S. in the &#x27;80s, Barron held his own by rehabbing his own hotels and increasing revenues in Las Vegas. Through a series of massive additions to the Flamingo Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton, the company nearly tripled its rooms in Las Vegas by 1990, from 2,277 to 6,703. He also launched Conrad International in the &#x27;80s, and Hilton Garden Inn in the &#x27;90s.

In contrast to his gamble on gaming, Hilton earned a reputation as a financial conservative. After seeing his father struggle to overcome the effects of the Great Depression and World War II, he maintained the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Throughout his 30 years as CEO, he carried a low debt-to-capital ratio and a high credit rating, enabling him to gobble up such properties as Bally&#x27;s Reno (formerly the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino-Reno). The 2,000-room resort was opened in 1978 for $230 million, and purchased by Hilton in 1992 for $88 million. With strong cash flow and plenty of liquid investments on hand, he was able to weather the inevitable recessions and business interruptions that struck the industry from the mid-&#x27;60s to the mid-&#x27;90s.
Hilton continued as chairman of the board through the next decade as his hand-picked successor, Steve Bollenbach, dramatically expanded the company through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The advent of friendly capital markets in the late &#x27;90s enabled him to acquire such brands as Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites, Bally&#x27;s and Caesars. Then, in 2005, he reacquired Hilton International, 38 years after it had been sold to TWA. With the company now strategically complete, Bollenbach spun off the gaming business, which merged with Harrah&#x27;s in 2005 and was renamed Caesars Entertainment.

In 2007, private equity firm The Blackstone Group purchased Hilton Hotels Corporation, consisting of 2,800 hotels with 480,000 rooms in 76 countries and territories. Blackstone paid $47.50 per share, a 32 percent premium over the July 2 closing price. The $26 billion, all-cash transaction included $7.5 billion of debt.

Host Hotels &amp; Resorts veteran Chris Nassetta was hired to manage the company, which was renamed Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and is now known as Hilton, Inc. Now celebrating the 100th year since Conrad Hilton purchased his first hotel, the company has expanded to include 17 brands, 5,800 hotels, and 939,000 rooms in 114 countries of the world.

== Hilton family fortune ==
In 1979, Barron Hilton&#x27;s father, Conrad Hilton, died at age 91. He left 13.5 million shares of Hilton Hotels Corporation stock—97 percent of his estate—to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, a humanitarian charity which he had established in 1944.

In his will, Conrad also gave Barron the right to purchase those shares in order to maintain family control of the company, but the foundation challenged the option in probate court. It took an entire decade to resolve the issue. Hilton&#x27;s right to exercise his option was upheld in an appeals court ruling in March 1988, giving him voting power over roughly 34 percent of the company&#x27;s outstanding shares. Conrad&#x27;s bequest of stock was worth $160 million when he died in 1979. Thanks to his son&#x27;s successful management of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, those shares were worth $654 million when the settlement was reached late in 1988. In a press statement issued after the favorable ruling, Hilton said it gave him &quot;the opportunity to structure an arrangement whereby my father&#x27;s two objectives, retaining control of the stock in family hands, and benefiting charity through the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, can both be achieved. I am confident that my father would be pleased with this accord.&quot;

The settlement was finalized in 1989. Neither Hilton, nor the foundation, had to actually pay for the shares; they split them instead. Hilton received 4 million shares, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation received 3.5 million shares, and the remaining 6 million shares were placed in the W. Barron Hilton Charitable remainder unitrust, of which Barron was the executor. He received 60 percent of the unitrust income, and the foundation 40 percent, during his lifetime, then the fund would transfer to the foundation.

On December 25, 2007, Hilton announced that he would follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps by leaving about 97 percent of his estate, estimated at that time to be $2.3 billion, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Included was an immediate pledge of $1.2 billion, the proceeds of the sale of Hilton Hotels Corporation and Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment Inc., which was placed in a charitable remainder unitrust that would be transferred to the foundation upon Hilton&#x27;s death at whatever value the trust was worth at that time. The remainder of the funds that constitute Hilton&#x27;s pledge of 97 percent of his estate will come from his personal assets, which were estimated at $1.1 billion at the time.

==Conrad N. Hilton Foundation==
Throughout his career, Conrad Hilton supported a variety of causes, particularly those involving the nuns that had helped educate him in his native New Mexico. He established the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation in 1944, and made a total of $7.6 million of gifts before his death.

In his last will and testament, Conrad left general guidance for the use of his endowment. He wrote: &quot;There is a natural law, a Divine law, that obliges you and me to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute. Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind. It is the virtue that unites men and inspires their noblest efforts. &#x27;Love one another, for that is the whole law;&#x27; so our fellow men deserve to be loved and encouraged—never abandoned to wander alone in poverty and darkness. The practice of charity will bind us—will bind all men in one great brotherhood. As the funds you will expend have come from many places in the world, so let there be no territorial, religious, or color restrictions on your benefactions, but beware of organized, professional charities with high-salaried executives and a heavy ratio of expense. Be ever watchful for the opportunity to shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity; be generous to their schools, their hospitals and their places of worship. For, as they must bear the burdens of our mistakes, so are they in their innocence the repositories of our hopes for the upward progress of humanity. Give aid to their protectors and defenders, the Sisters, who devote their love and life&#x27;s work for the good of mankind, for they appeal especially to me as being deserving of help from the Foundation.&quot;

==Aviation career==
Hilton was born the year Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis across the Atlantic. When he was 7 or 8 years old, he would ride his bike to Love Field in Dallas to watch the exotic planes of the day take off and land. He promised himself that he would one day learn to fly. He took private flying lessons at a field on the north shore of Oahu during his time in the Navy, and got his pilot&#x27;s license at age 17.

In addition to his single-engine and multi-engine ratings, Hilton eventually earned glider, lighter than air (balloons) and helicopter ratings as well. He maintained a small fleet of aircraft at his Flying M Ranch east of the sierras in northern Nevada that includes sailplanes, tow planes, aerobatic aircraft, hot air balloons and classic, restored biplanes. He flew them all until he retired from the cockpit in 2012 at age 84.

In the &#x27;90s, he boldly backed the first attempts to capture one of the last great milestones in aviation—flying non-stop around the world in a balloon—with the Earthwinds Hilton and Global Hilton campaigns. While falling short of the ultimate goal, Hilton is credited with inspiring the efforts of those who achieved the feat. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones were the first to make a trans-global flight in 1999; Steve Fossett became the first to complete the flight solo in 2002.

From 1980 to 2009, he also hosted the Barron Hilton Cup, a unique, worldwide glider competition. Pilots who flew the longest triangular flights during each two-year period in six regions of the world earned participation in a weeklong soaring camp at his Flying M Ranch. Co-founder Helmut Reichmann, Germany&#x27;s three-time world soaring champion, devised a handicap system that enabled pilots flying older gliders to compete with elite pilots in high-performance aircraft of the latest design. Once at the Flying M, they flew recreationally alongside world champions and celebrities invited to attend by Hilton. Beginning in 1996 with its predecessors, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., EADS, had served as a partner in the event.

Over the years, a number of notable pilots regularly joined Hilton for weekends at the Flying M. They include entertainers John Denver and Cliff Robertson; astronauts Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, Bill Anders, and Ulf Merbold; and test pilots and record-holders: Chuck Yeager, Johnny Myers, Clay Lacy, Bruno GanTenbrink, Bob Hoover, Carroll Shelby, Sully Sullenberger, and air, sea and land adventurer, Steve Fossett.

On Labor Day, 2007, Fossett took off from the Flying M Ranch and never returned, perishing in a crash in the Sierras. In spite of an intensive search, the wreckage wasn&#x27;t discovered until the following spring. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause(s) of this accident to be &quot;the pilot&#x27;s inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain.&quot; Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any malfunctions or failures that would have prevented normal operation.

The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum honored Hilton in 2010 by christening the Barron Hilton Pioneers of Flight Gallery. The redesigned exhibit recognizes aviators like Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart and the Tuskegee Airmen. The gallery includes an early childhood education component funded by the Hilton Foundation to help youngsters catch the same enthusiasm for aviation that he discovered as a child when Lindbergh and Earhart were making headlines.

In 2012, Barron was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

For his lifelong support of aviation, Hilton received the prestigious FAI Gold Air Medal from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 2009, the same award bestowed upon some of his closest friends and personal heroes, like Yeager, Armstrong, Cernan, Jones, Fossett, and Lindbergh himself.

In 2012, Hilton was also inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in San Diego, and was hailed as the &quot;patron saint of sport aviation.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1947, Barron Hilton married Marilyn June Hawley; they remained married until she died in 2004. They had eight children: William Barron Hilton, Jr.; Hawley Anne Hilton; Stephen Michael Hilton; David Alan Hilton; Sharon Constance Hilton; Richard Howard Hilton; Daniel Kevin Hilton; and Ronald Jeffrey Hilton; William Barron Hilton, Jr. was born in 1948 and Ronald Jeffrey Hilton was born in 1963. Barron Hilton had 15 grandchildren, including Richard Hilton&#x27;s daughters Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton Rothschild, and four great-grandchildren.

His primary residence in Holmby Hills was the Jay Paley House, originally designed in the 1930s for Jay Paley by architect Paul Williams. It was used as the &#x27;Colby mansion&#x27; in exterior scenes for &quot;The Colbys&quot; television series. He also maintained a permanent suite in New York&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria.

Hilton and several friends purchased the 475,000-acre Flying-M Ranch in Lyon County, Nevada (the property stretched across the California state line) in the mid-1960s, and he bought the others out in 1972. The ranch included an airport and a two-hole putting green. 

Barron Hilton died at his home in Los Angeles on September 19, 2019. He was the last surviving child of Conrad Hilton.

==Other==
Hilton was a member of a duck club on Venice Island in the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta near Stockton in Northern California. Every year he put on a large Fourth of July fireworks display, attracting thousands of boaters to watch it.

<text>Newton Henry Allen (May 19, 1901 – June 9, 1988) was an American second baseman and manager in baseball&#x27;s Negro leagues.

Born in Austin, Texas, he began his Negro league career late in 1923 with the Kansas City Monarchs and, except for brief stints with other teams in 1931 and 1932, stayed with the Monarchs until his retirement in 1948. Long known for his leadership ability, he became the Monarchs&#x27; manager in 1941 when Andy Cooper suffered a pre-season stroke and died during the season. He won the Negro American League championship that season, but resigned as manager just before the beginning of the following season, resuming his duties as a reserve infielder.

Allen&#x27;s accomplishments as a player were even more impressive. A master at scoring runs, he bunted, stole bases and almost always provided the spark his team needed to win. Among the fastest baserunners of his generation of Negro leaguers, his most remarkable season was his 1929 campaign, in which he batted .330 while hitting 24 doubles and stealing 23 bases in a typically abbreviated Negro league season.

Allen is listed on the second team of a 1952 &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; poll of the greatest black baseball players of all time. Allen made the list of 39 finalists for the 2006 special Negro leagues and Pre-Negro leagues Election for the Baseball Hall of Fame, but was not one of the 17 finally chosen.

Allen died at age 87 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

<doc id="699409" wikidata="Q180447" url="?curid=699409" title="Rutilus">
<text>Rutilus is a genus of fish in the family Cyprinidae found in Eurasia. This genus is a widely distributed lineage of cyprinids and ranges from West Europe to East Siberia.

==Species==
In FishBase (2022), nine species are included in the genus:
* &quot;Rutilus caspicus&quot; (Caspian roach)
* &quot;Rutilus frisii&quot; (Black sea roach)
* &quot;Rutilus heckelii&quot; 
* &quot;Rutilus kutum&quot; (Caspian kutum)
* &quot;Rutilus meidingeri&quot; 
* &quot;Rutilus pigus&quot; (Pigo)
* &quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot; (Common roach)
* &quot;Rutilus stoumboudae&quot; 
* &quot;Rutilus virgo&quot; (Cactus roach)

In a phylogeographic study, Levin et al. (2017) argue that the Ponto-Caspian taxa including &quot;R. caspicus&quot;, &quot;R. heckelii&quot; and &quot;R. stoumboudae&quot; could represent a single widespread species whose range extends to Siberia, to be named &quot;Rutilus lacustris&quot;, whereas &quot;R. kutum&quot; is included in &quot;R. frisii&quot;. 
The genera &quot;Leucos&quot; and &quot;Sarmarutilus&quot; have been recently separated from &quot;Rutilus&quot; and are closely related to it.

<text>Erich Neumann (; 23 January 1905 – 5 November 1960) was a German psychologist, philosopher, writer, and student of Carl Jung.

==Life and career==
Neumann was born in Berlin to a Jewish family. He received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg in 1927. Then, he continued to study medicine at the University of Berlin, where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933.

In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julie, who were both Zionists, moved to Tel Aviv to avoid being persecuted by the Nazi Government. For many years, he regularly returned to Zürich, Switzerland to give lectures at the C. G. Jung Institute. He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the International Association for Analytical Psychology and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death from kidney cancer in 1960.

==Overview of Work==
Erich Neumann was a Jungian psychologist whose work focused on the evolution of consciousness, depth psychology, and archetypal symbolism. He expanded Carl Jung’s theories, particularly in the areas of mythology, creativity, and the integration of the unconscious.

One of Neumann’s most significant contributions was his theory of the evolution of consciousness, outlined in &quot;The Origins and History of Consciousness&quot; (1949). In this work, Neumann proposed a developmental model of human consciousness based on mythological and psychological stages, tracing the emergence of the ego from the collective unconscious through symbolic narratives. His approach was deeply influenced by Jung’s concept of archetypes, but he extended it by emphasizing the cultural evolution of the psyche. Carl Jung wrote the introduction and fully endorsed the work as a direct continuation of his body of work.

Neumann also made notable contributions to the study of archetypal feminine symbolism in &quot;The Great Mother&quot; (1955), where he examined universal representations of the feminine principle in mythology, religion, and psychology. This work remains an influential text in depth psychology and symbolic studies, offering an interpretation of how matriarchal and patriarchal structures evolve through myth and collective unconscious imagery.

In &quot;Depth Psychology and a New Ethic&quot; (1949), Neumann explored the role of the shadow in individual and collective psychology, arguing that Western culture’s repression of the shadow leads to projection, scapegoating, and social unrest. He proposed a &quot;new ethic&quot;, in which individuals take responsibility for their unconscious drives rather than externalizing them onto others. His work in this area has been recognized as an early psychological critique of authoritarianism and mass psychology, particularly in relation to post-WWII Europe.

Neumann also wrote extensively about creativity and the role of artistic expression in psychological transformation. In &quot;Art and the Creative Unconscious&quot; (1959), Neumann argued that art serves as a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind, playing a crucial role in the development of individual and collective consciousness. The book analyzes the creative process in mythological and artistic traditions, viewing it as a key mechanism for psychological integration. In the first essay, &quot;Leonardo da Vinci and the Mother Archetype&quot;, Neumann explicitly refutes Freud’s psychoanalytic interpretation of Leonardo’s childhood memory and artistic motivations, &quot;Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood&quot;. The essay explains that, unlike Freud, who viewed Leonardo’s creativity as the result of repressed sexuality and sublimation, Neumann argued that Leonardo’s themes should be understood through the Jungian framework of archetypes, particularly the Great Mother, and the Great Individual archetypes.

Additionally, Neumann developed the concept of centroversion, which he described as the integration of extraversion and introversion, allowing for a balanced psychological state. This concept was intended to describe a mature ego that harmonizes both conscious and unconscious elements, facilitating individual and cultural development. While influential in analytical psychology, centroversion remained a theoretical contribution rather than an empirically tested construct.

== Bibliography ==

<text>Eric Stoltz (born September 30, 1961) is an American actor, director and producer. He played Rocky Dennis in the biographical drama film &quot;Mask&quot; (1985), which earned him the nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. 

He has appeared in a wide variety of films, from mainstream ones including &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; to independent films such as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;, and &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot;. He was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. In 2010, he portrayed Daniel Graystone in the science fiction television series &quot;Caprica&quot; and became a regular director on the television series &quot;Glee&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Stoltz was born in Whittier, California, the son of Evelyn (née Vawter), a violinist and schoolteacher, and Jack Stoltz, an elementary school teacher. He has two sisters.

Stoltz was raised in both American Samoa and Santa Barbara, California. He attended the University of Southern California, but dropped out after his junior year. He moved to New York in 1981 and studied acting with Stella Adler and Peggy Feury.

==Career==

In the 1970s, Stoltz joined a repertory company that performed ten plays at the Edinburgh Festival. He returned to the United States in 1979, when he entered USC as a drama student. He dropped out to pursue film and television roles.

In 1978, he was cast as Steve Benson in the television adaptation of Erma Bombeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank&quot;.

Director Cameron Crowe and Stoltz became friends when the latter appeared in his first feature film, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982). Crowe wrote it and Stoltz had a minor role. According to Stoltz, Crowe promised Stoltz roles in all of his future films.

Stoltz was cast in each of Crowe&#x27;s next four films, &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984), &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), &quot;Singles&quot; (1992) and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996).

In 1985, Stoltz received a Golden Globe nomination for starring performance as Rocky Dennis in &quot;Mask&quot;. Among his other roles in the 1980s, he appeared in the 1987 film &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, written and produced by John Hughes.

Stoltz was originally cast as Marty McFly in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. His view of the movie clashed, however, with that of the director, Robert Zemeckis. While the film was to become a sci-fi comedy (and box office smash hit), Stoltz had read the script from a more serious angle, apparently focusing on the tragic consequences of going back to live a life that was not one&#x27;s own. Five weeks into shooting, Zemeckis replaced Stoltz with Michael J. Fox.

In 1989, Stoltz starred as the lead character of the sequel &quot;The Fly II&quot;. The movie was a hit, grossing approximately $38.9 million worldwide.

During the 1990s, Stoltz went back and forth between stage, film and television, appearing in studio and independent films such as &quot;The Waterdance&quot; (1992), &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot; (1996) and &quot;Anaconda&quot; (1997).

During the 1990s, Stoltz produced the films &quot;Bodies, Rest &amp; Motion&quot; (1993), &quot;Sleep with Me&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mr. Jealousy&quot; (1997).

He continued to appear on the New York stage, both on Broadway (&quot;Three Sisters&quot;, &quot;Two Shakespearean Actors&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, &quot; Our Town&quot;) and off-Broadway (&quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, &quot;Sly Fox&quot;). He was nominated for a Tony Award as Featured Actor for his performance as George Gibbs in the 1989 Broadway revival of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;.

A performance of this production was featured on &quot;Great Performances: Live from Lincoln Center&quot;, which received a 1989 Emmy nomination.

On television, he had a recurring role as Helen Hunt&#x27;s character&#x27;s ex-boyfriend on &quot;Mad About You&quot; (five episodes, 1994–1998), spent a year on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994) and did some television and cable films such as &quot;Inside&quot; (1996) (directed by Arthur Penn) and &quot;The Passion of Ayn Rand&quot; (1999), with Helen Mirren. Stoltz received the Indie Supporter Award at the 1998 Los Angeles Film Festival.

During the first part of the 2000s, he starred with Gillian Anderson in &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; (2000), based on the novel by Edith Wharton. From 2001 to 2002, he had a recurring role as the English teacher-poet August Dimitri in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once and Again&quot;, wherein Julia Whelan&#x27;s character, a teenager, fell in love with his character. He directed an episode of the show in 2002.

In 2003, he played his first leading TV role in &quot;Out of Order&quot;, which was canceled after five episodes. At the same year, he also played Otto in When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, alongside Jonathan Lipnicki. In 2004, he appeared in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; as a child molester; the following year, he guest-starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; as Debra Messing&#x27;s love interest. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his direction of the cable movie &quot;My Horrible Year!&quot; (2001). He also directed a short film entitled &quot;The Bulls&quot; as well as the highest-rated episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in 2005, entitled &quot;Tombstone&quot;. He appeared in the music video of The Residents&#x27; &quot;Give It to Someone Else&quot;, featured on &quot;The Commercial DVD&quot;.

He has contributed essays to the books &quot;City Secrets--New York&quot; as well as &quot;Life Interrupted&quot; by Spalding Gray and appears on the children&#x27;s CD &quot;Philadelphia Chickens&quot;.

Beginning in 2007, Stoltz directed episodes of the drama series &quot;Quarterlife&quot;, which began airing as webisodes and were then picked up to air on the NBC network in 2008. Stoltz played a serial killer in need of medical attention in three episodes of the fifth season of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. He has also directed two episodes of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

Stoltz starred as Daniel Graystone, inventor of the Cylons, in the science fiction television series &quot;Caprica&quot;, a prequel set 58 years before the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series.

He became a regular director of the series, &quot;Glee&quot;, directing a total of 12 episodes, including &quot;Nationals&quot;, in which the Glee club finally wins the championship.

In 2011, Stoltz was seen back on the silver screen with the film &quot;Fort McCoy&quot;; he earned accolades for his leading role as a conflicted barber of German heritage forced to suppress his American patriotism after moving his family to a post–World War II military base housing a German POW camp.

Starting in 2014, Stoltz became the producing director of the CBS political drama series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. The following year he became one of its four executive producers, alongside Morgan Freeman and Barbara Hall and has directed more than 10 episodes, as well as starring alongside Téa Leoni in several episodes as her brother, Will Adams.

==Personal life==
Stoltz and Bridget Fonda began dating in 1990. The relationship ended after eight years.

Stoltz married Bernadette Moley, a singer, in 2005. The couple have one child, a daughter.

Stoltz is a vegetarian.

<doc id="699418" wikidata="Q130079" url="?curid=699418" title="David Wu">
<text>David Wu (born April 8, 1955) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1999 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Wu was born in Taiwan, immigrated to the United States as a child, and graduated from Stanford University. After attending Harvard Medical School, he earned a law degree from Yale University. He was the first Taiwanese American to serve in the House of Representatives. Wu announced that he would resign from office following resolution of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, days after reports surfaced that an 18-year-old woman had left a voicemail at Wu&#x27;s campaign office accusing him of an unwanted sexual encounter. Wu acknowledged the encounter and said it was consensual.

Wu submitted his resignation on August 3, 2011. A special election was held on January 31, 2012, to fill the vacancy in advance of the regular 2012 election. Democrat Suzanne Bonamici defeated Republican challenger Rob Cornilles to win this special election.

Since his resignation, Wu has remained in the Washington, D.C. area. He has been raising money for local Democratic parties, and organizing student exchange programs between the Chinese and American space programs.

==Early life and education==
Wu was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan. His parents were from Suzhou in Jiangsu province and settled in Taiwan due to the Chinese Civil War. The family moved to the United States in 1961. Wu spent his first two years in the U.S. in Latham, New York, where his family were the only Asian Americans in town.

Wu received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Stanford University in 1977 and attended Harvard Medical School for a time, sharing an apartment with future-United States Senator Bill Frist. Wu did not complete his medical studies. Instead, he attended Yale Law School where he was awarded a Juris Doctor degree in 1982.

==Law career==
Wu served as a clerk for a federal judge. 
In 1984, he joined the Miller Nash law firm. In 1988, he co-founded the law firm of Cohen &amp; Wu. The firm focused on representing clients in Oregon&#x27;s high-tech development sector, centered on &quot;Silicon Forest.&quot;

==U.S. Congressman==

===Elections===
Wu was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998, succeeding Democrat Elizabeth Furse. He narrowly defeated Republican Molly Bordonaro by a little over 7,100 votes. He won re-election in 2000, defeating state senator Charles Starr in the November election with 58% of the vote to 39% for Starr. Redistricting after the 2000 census made the 1st considerably more Democratic, notably by adding a small portion of Multnomah County. Wu won re-election in 2004 over Republican Goli Ameri; in 2006 over Oregon state representative Derrick Kitts and two minor party candidates; and in 2008 with no Republican candidate running, he captured 72% of the vote to win a sixth term over four minor party candidates. He faced his most difficult reelection test in 2010, defeating Republican challenger Rob Cornilles with 54% of the vote.

===Tenure ===

Wu was a member of the New Democrat Coalition (NDC), a group of moderate Democrats in the House. In 2009, he received a 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. He was also a member of the executive board for the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and served as chair from January 2001 to January 2004.

Wu funded virus research at the Oregon Health and Science University that may be the first effective treatment and vaccine for AIDS. He authored legislation to promote research and product development by small businesses using a portion of federal research grants. Wu was a staunch supporter of science and research at both the basic and applied levels.

In the House, Wu was known for taking a strong stand on human rights and the rule of law, sometimes at the risk of his own seat. He opposed granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China (renamed later as &quot;Normal Trade Relations&quot;), citing human rights violations and predicting that the trade deficit with China would balloon under the legislation. The two largest employers in his Congressional District, Nike and Intel, strongly supported granting MFN status to China. He favored closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, citing rule of law concerns.

Wu was a strong advocate for NASA and the space program. He served on the House Science Committee, which has jurisdiction over NASA, and on its Space Subcommittee, then chaired by Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Wu defended NASA&#x27;s budget and advocated for NASA goals for space exploration that are not subject to political influence. He viewed student interest in space as a way to promote STEM education, and founded a space camp scholarship program for underprivileged children. Wu continued this effort after he left Congress, and also started a program to send American students to China to learn about its space program. Chinese students were also included in order to promote international cooperation in space.

Perhaps Wu&#x27;s most enduring legacy is his successful effort with his Washington State colleague Brian Baird to create the Lewis and Clark National Historic Park located at the mouth of the Columbia River. He expanded the Fort Clatsop National Memorial in 2002 and incorporated it into an expanded park in 2004.

===Sexual assault allegation and resignation===
On July 22, 2011, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that an 18-year-old woman left a voicemail at Wu&#x27;s campaign office accusing him of an unwanted sexual encounter. The woman is the daughter of a longtime friend and campaign donor. Wu acknowledged the encounter and said it was consensual. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for an ethics investigation into the allegations. Wu initially indicated that he would not resign but would also not seek reelection in 2012. Several days later, however, Wu announced he would resign following resolution of the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis. He resigned on August 3, 2011. This was his second brush with sexual assault allegations. On Oct 12, 2004, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; published a 3000 word article on a 1976 incident in a dormitory at Stanford University.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Education and Labor
**Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training
**Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
*Committee on Science, Space and Technology
**Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics
**Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation (Ranking Member)

==Post-Congress==

In 2014 &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; reported that Wu was still living in the Washington area. The article noted that he frequently visited the Capitol and House offices to see friends, many of whom were still serving, such as Rep. Peter DeFazio. He also annually attended the Congressional Baseball Game, sometimes sat in on hearings and occasionally ventured onto the House floor, a privilege he is allowed as a former member.

Under the terms of his divorce, Wu explained to &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;, he must live in the Washington area until his daughter and son have finished high school. His income primarily comes from consulting for Chinese companies seeking to do business in the U.S.; he is also sometimes quoted in the Chinese media about issues such as the Senkaku Islands dispute (he supports China&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over the islands, currently administered by Japan).

Wu is also treasurer of the Education and Opportunity Fund, a political action committee that supports county-level Democratic committees. At the time of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;&#x27;s article, he was trying to organize a student exchange program to allow Chinese and American students to tour the other country&#x27;s space-program facilities, an exception to the prohibition on cooperation that otherwise exists. He said he eventually intended to return to Oregon.

==Personal life==
Wu married Michelle Reinmiller in 1996, and they have two children. In December 2009, he filed for separation from his wife, citing irreconcilable differences, and is now divorced. Previously living in Portland, Oregon, Wu lives in the Washington D.C. area with his son, Matt Wu, and daughter.

<doc id="699422" wikidata="Q629000" url="?curid=699422" title="Timber framing">
<text>Timber framing () and &quot;post-and-beam&quot; construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers, creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs. If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered, and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect. The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany, where timber-framed houses are spread all over the country.

The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber. Hewing this with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (brace and bit) and other woodworking tools, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building.

Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world like Europe (Germany, France, Norway, Switzerland, etc.) and Asia, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details.

==Box frame==
A simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof without purlins. The term &quot;box frame&quot; is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing (with the usual exception of cruck framing). The distinction presented here is that the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. Purlins are also found even in plain timber frames.

==Cruck frame==
A cruck is a pair of crooked or curved timbers which form a bent (U.S.) or crossframe (UK); the individual timbers are each called a blade. More than 4,000 cruck frame buildings have been recorded in the UK. Several types of cruck frames are used; more information follows in English style below and at the main article Cruck.

* True cruck or full cruck: blades, straight or curved, extend from ground or foundation to the ridge acting as the principal rafters. A full cruck does not need a tie beam.
* Base cruck: tops of the blades are truncated by the first transverse member such as by a tie beam.
* Raised cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and extend to the ridge.
* Middle cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and are truncated by a collar.
* Upper cruck: blades land on a tie beam, similar to knee rafters.
* Jointed cruck: blades are made from pieces joined near eaves in a number of ways. See also: hammerbeam roof
* End cruck is not a style, but on the gable end of a building.


==Aisled frame==

Aisled frames have one or more rows of interior posts. These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. This is the same concept of the aisle in church buildings, sometimes called a hall church, where the center aisle is technically called a nave. However, a nave is often called an aisle, and three-aisled barns are common in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Aisled buildings are wider than the simpler box-framed or cruck-framed buildings, and typically have purlins supporting the rafters. In northern Germany, this construction is known as variations of a&quot; Ständerhaus&quot;. 

==Half-timbering==

Half-timbering refers to a structure with a frame of load-bearing timber, creating spaces between the timbers called panels (in German or = partitions), which are then filled-in with some kind of nonstructural material known as infill. The frame is often left exposed on the exterior of the building.

===Infill materials===
Gallery of infill types:
The earliest known type of infill, called &quot;opus craticum&quot; by the Romans, was a wattle and daub type construction. &quot;Opus craticum&quot; is now confusingly applied to a Roman stone/mortar infill as well. Similar methods to wattle and daub were also used and known by various names, such as clam staff and daub, cat-and-clay, or &quot;torchis&quot; (French), to name only three.

Wattle and daub was the most common infill in ancient times. The sticks were not always technically wattlework (woven), but also individual sticks installed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle into holes or grooves in the framing. The coating of daub has many recipes, but generally was a mixture of clay and chalk with a binder such as grass or straw and water or urine. When the manufacturing of bricks increased, brick infill replaced the less durable infills and became more common. Stone laid in mortar as an infill was used in areas where stone rubble and mortar were available.

Other infills include &quot;bousillage&quot;, fired brick, unfired brick such as adobe or mudbrick, stones sometimes called &quot;pierrotage&quot;, planks as in the German &quot;ständerbohlenbau&quot;, timbers as in &quot;ständerblockbau&quot;, or rarely cob without any wooden support. The wall surfaces on the interior were often &quot;ceiled&quot; with wainscoting and plastered for warmth and appearance.

Brick infill sometimes called nogging became the standard infill after the manufacturing of bricks made them more available and less expensive. Half-timbered walls may be covered by siding materials including plaster, weatherboarding, tiles, or slate shingles.

The infill may be covered by other materials, including weatherboarding or tiles, or left exposed. When left exposed, both the framing and infill were sometimes done in a decorative manner. Germany is famous for its decorative half-timbering and the figures sometimes have names and meanings. The decorative manner of half-timbering is promoted in Germany by the German Timber-Frame Road, several planned routes people can drive to see notable examples of &quot;Fachwerk&quot; buildings.

Gallery of some named figures and decorations:
The collection of elements in half timbering are sometimes given specific names:
===History of the term===
According to Craven (2019), the term:
was used informally to mean timber-framed construction in the Middle Ages. For economy, cylindrical logs were cut in half, so one log could be used for two (or more) posts. The shaved side was traditionally on the exterior and everyone knew it to be half the timber.

The term half-timbering is not as old as the German name or the French name , but it is the standard English name for this style. One of the first people to publish the term &quot;half-timbered&quot; was Mary Martha Sherwood (1775–1851), who employed it in her book, &quot;The Lady of the Manor&quot;, published in several volumes from 1823 to 1829. She uses the term picturesquely: &quot;...passing through a gate in a quickset hedge, we arrived at the porch of an old half-timbered cottage, where an aged man and woman received us.&quot; By 1842, half-timbered had found its way into &quot;The Encyclopedia of Architecture&quot; by Joseph Gwilt (1784–1863). This of exposed timbered beams and infilled spaces created the distinctive &quot;half-timbered&quot;, or occasionally termed, &quot;Tudor&quot; style, or &quot;black-and-white&quot;.

===Oldest examples===
The most ancient known half-timbered building is called the House of &quot;opus craticum&quot;. It was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD in Herculaneum, Italy. &quot;Opus craticum&quot; was mentioned by Vitruvius in his books on architecture as a timber frame with wattlework infill. However, the same term is used to describe timber frames with an infill of stone rubble laid in mortar the Romans called &quot;opus incertum&quot;.

===Alternative meanings===
A less common meaning of the term &quot;half-timbered&quot; is found in the fourth edition of John Henry Parker&#x27;s &quot;Classic Dictionary of Architecture&quot; (1873) which distinguishes full-timbered houses from half-timbered, with half-timber houses having a ground floor in stone or logs such as the Kluge House which was a log cabin with a timber-framed second floor.

==Structure==


Traditional timber framing is the method of creating framed structures of heavy timber jointed together with various joints, commonly and originally with lap jointing, and then later pegged mortise and tenon joints. Diagonal bracing is used to prevent &quot;racking&quot;, or movement of structural vertical beams or posts.

Originally, German (and other) master carpenters would peg the joints with allowance of about , enough room for the wood to move as it &#x27;seasoned&#x27;, then cut the pegs, and drive the beam home fully into its socket.

To cope with variable sizes and shapes of hewn (by adze or axe) and sawn timbers, two main carpentry methods were employed: scribe carpentry and square rule carpentry.

Scribing or coping was used throughout Europe, especially from the 12th century to the 19th century, and subsequently imported to North America, where it was common into the early 19th century. In a scribe frame, timber sockets are fashioned or &quot;tailor-made&quot; to fit their corresponding timbers; thus, each timber piece must be numbered (or &quot;scribed&quot;).

Square-rule carpentry was developed in New England in the 18th century. It used housed joints in main timbers to allow for interchangeable braces and girts. Today, standardized timber sizing means that timber framing can be incorporated into mass-production methods as per the joinery industry, especially where timber is cut by precision computer numerical control machinery.

===Jetties===

A jetty is an upper floor which sometimes historically used a structural horizontal beam, supported on cantilevers, called a bressummer or &#x27;jetty bressummer&#x27; to bear the weight of the new wall, projecting outward from the preceding floor or storey.

In the city of York in the United Kingdom, the famous street known as The Shambles exemplifies this, where jettied houses seem to almost touch above the street.

===Timbers===
Historically, the timbers would have been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more commonly bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.

The vertical timbers include:
* posts (main supports at corners and other major uprights),
* wall studs (subsidiary upright limbs in framed walls), for example, close studding.

The horizontal timbers include:
* sill-beams (also called ground-sills or sole-pieces, at the bottom of a wall into which posts and studs are fitted using tenons),
* noggin-pieces (the horizontal timbers forming the tops and bottoms of the frames of infill panels),
* wall-plates (at the top of timber-framed walls that support the trusses and joists of the roof).

When jettying, horizontal elements can include:
* The jetty bressummer (or breastsummer), where the main sill (horizontal piece) on which the projecting wall above rests, stretches across the whole width of the jetty wall. The bressummer is itself cantilevered forward, beyond the wall below it.
* The dragon-beam which runs diagonally from one corner to another, and supports the corner posts above and supported by the corner posts below
* The jetty beams or joists conform t floor dimensions above, but are at right angles to the jetty-plates that conform to the shorter dimensions of &quot;roof&quot; of the floor below. Jetty beams are mortised at 45° into the sides of the dragon beams. They are the main constituents of the cantilever system, and determine how far the jetty projects.
* The jetty-plates are designed to carry the jetty beams. The jetty plates themselves are supported by the corner posts of the recessed floor below.

The sloping timbers include:
* Trusses (the slanting timbers forming the triangular framework at gables and roof)
* Braces (slanting beams giving extra support between horizontal or vertical members of the timber frame)
* Herringbone bracing (a decorative and supporting style of frame, usually at 45° to the upright and horizontal directions of the frame)

===Post construction and frame construction===
Historically were two different systems of the position of posts and studs:
* In the older (medieval) manner, called post construction, the vertical elements continue from the groundwork to the roof. This post construction in German is called or . It is somewhat similar to balloon framing method common in North America until the middle of the 20th century.
* In the advanced manner, called frame construction, each story is constructed like a case, and the whole building is constructed like a pile of such cases. This frame construction in German is called or &quot;&quot; and allows jettying.

Ridge-post framing is a structurally simple and ancient post and lintel framing where the posts extend all the way to the ridge beams. Germans call this &quot;Firstsäule&quot; or &quot;&quot;.

=== Modern timber connector method (1930s–1950s) ===

In the 1930s a system of timber framing referred to as the &quot;modern timber connector method&quot; was developed. It was characterized by the use of timber members assembled into trusses and other framing systems and fastened using various types of metal timber connectors. This type of timber construction was used for various building types including warehouses, factories, garages, barns, stores/markets, recreational buildings, barracks, bridges, and trestles. The use of these structures was promoted because of their low construction costs, easy adaptability, and performance in fire as compared to unprotected steel truss construction.

During World War II, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Canadian Military Engineers undertook to construct airplane hangars using this timber construction system in order to conserve steel. Wood hangars were constructed throughout North America and employed various technologies including bowstring, Warren, and Pratt trusses, glued laminated arches, and lamella roof systems. Unique to this building type is the interlocking of the timber members of the roof trusses and supporting columns and their connection points. The timber members are held apart by &quot;fillers&quot; (blocks of timber). This leaves air spaces between the timber members which improves air circulation and drying around the members which improves resistance to moisture borne decay.

Timber members in this type of framing system were connected with ferrous timber connectors of various types. Loads between timber members were transmitted using split-rings (larger loads), toothed rings (lighter loads), or spiked grid connectors. Split-ring connectors were metal rings sandwiched between adjacent timber members to connect them together. The rings were fit into circular grooves on in both timber members then the assembly was held together with through-bolts. The through-bolts only held the assembly together but were not load-carrying. Shear plate connectors were used to transfer loads between timber members and metal. Shear plate connectors resembled large washers, deformed on the side facing the timber in order to grip it, and were through-fastened with long bolts or lengths of threaded rod. A leading manufacturer of these types of timber connectors was the Timber Engineering Company, or TECO, of Washington, DC. The proprietary name of their split-ring connectors was the &quot;TECO Wedge-Fit&quot;.

===Modern features===
Timber-framed structures differ from conventional wood-framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer, larger wooden members, commonly timbers in the range of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), while common wood framing uses many more timbers with dimensions usually in the 5- to 25-cm (2- to 10-in) range. The methods of fastening the frame members also differ. In conventional framing, the members are joined using nails or other mechanical fasteners, whereas timber framing uses the traditional mortise and tenon or more complex joints that are usually fastened using only wooden pegs. Modern complex structures and timber trusses often incorporate steel joinery such as gusset plates, for both structural and architectural purposes.

Recently, it has become common practice to enclose the timber structure entirely in manufactured panels such as structural insulated panels (SIPs). Although the timbers can only be seen from inside the building when so enclosed, construction is less complex and insulation is greater than in traditional timber building. SIPs are &quot;an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural facings, typically oriented strand board&quot; according to the Structural Insulated Panel Association. SIPs reduce dependency on bracing and auxiliary members, because the panels span considerable distances and add rigidity to the basic timber frame.

An alternate construction method is with concrete flooring with extensive use of glass. This allows a solid construction combined with open architecture. Some firms have specialized in industrial prefabrication of such residential and light commercial structures such as Huf Haus as low-energy houses or – dependent on location – zero-energy buildings.

Straw-bale construction is another alternative where straw bales are stacked for nonload-bearing infill with various finishes applied to the interior and exterior such as stucco and plaster. This appeals to the traditionalist and the environmentalist as this is using &quot;found&quot; materials to build.

Mudbricks also called adobe are sometimes used to fill in timber-frame structures. They can be made on site and offer exceptional fire resistance. Such buildings must be designed to accommodate the poor thermal insulating properties of mudbrick, however, and usually have deep eaves or a veranda on four sides for weather protection.

===Engineered structures===
Timber design or wood design is a subcategory of structural engineering that focuses on the engineering of wood structures. Timber is classified by tree species (e.g., southern pine, douglas fir, etc.) and its strength is graded using numerous coefficients that correspond to the number of knots, the moisture content, the temperature, the grain direction, the number of holes, and other factors. There are design specifications for sawn lumber, glulam members, prefabricated I-joists, composite lumber, and various connection types. In the United States, structural frames are then designed according to the Allowable Stress Design method or the Load Reduced Factor Design method (the latter being preferred).

==History and traditions==
The techniques used in timber framing date back to Neolithic times, and have been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, continental Europe, and Neolithic Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain, parts of the Roman Empire, and Scotland. The timber-framing technique has historically been popular in climate zones which favour deciduous hardwood trees, such as oak. Its northernmost areas are Baltic countries and southern Sweden. Timber framing is rare in Russia, Finland, northern Sweden, and Norway, where tall and straight lumber, such as pine and spruce, is readily available and log houses were favored, instead.

Half-timbered construction in the Northern European vernacular building style is characteristic of medieval and early modern Denmark, England, Germany, and parts of France and Switzerland, where timber was in good supply yet stone and associated skills to dress the stonework were in short supply. In half-timbered construction, timbers that were riven (split) in half provided the complete skeletal framing of the building.

Europe is full of timber-framed structures dating back hundreds of years, including manors, castles, homes, and inns, whose architecture and techniques of construction have evolved over the centuries. In Asia, timber-framed structures are found, many of them temples.

Some Roman carpentry preserved in anoxic layers of clay at Romano-British villa sites demonstrate that sophisticated Roman carpentry had all the necessary techniques for this construction. The earliest surviving (French) half-timbered buildings date from the 12th century.

Important resources for the study and appreciation of historic building methods are open-air museums.

===Topping out ceremony===
The topping out ceremony is a builders&#x27; rite, an ancient tradition thought to have originated in Scandinavia by 700 AD. In the U.S., a bough or small tree is attached to the peak of the timber frame after the frame is complete as a celebration. Historically, it was common for the master carpenter to give a speech, make a toast, and then break the glass. In Northern Europe, a wreath made for the occasion is more commonly used rather than a bough. In Japan, the &quot;ridge raising&quot; is a religious ceremony called the &quot;jotoshiki&quot;. In Germany, it is called the &quot;Richtfest&quot;.

===Carpenters&#x27; marks===
Carpenters&#x27; marks are markings left on the timbers of wooden buildings during construction.
* Assembly or marriage marks were used to identify the individual timbers. Assembly marks include numbering to identify the pieces of the frame. The numbering can be similar to Roman numerals except the number four is IIII and nine is VIIII. These marks are chiseled, cut with a race knife (a tool to cut lines and circles in wood), or saw cuts. The numbering can also be in Arabic numerals which are often written with a red grease pencil or crayon. German and French carpenters made some unique marks. (Abbundzeichen (German assembly marks)).
* Layout marks left over from marking out identify the place where to cut joints and bore peg holes; carpenters also marked the location on a timber where they had levelled it, as part of the building process, and called these &quot;level lines&quot;; sometimes they made a mark two feet from a critical location, which was then called the &quot;two-foot mark&quot;. These marks are typically scratched on the timber with an awl-like tool until later in the 19th century, when they started using pencils.
* Occasionally, carpenters or owners marked a date and/or their initials in the wood, but not like masons left masons&#x27; marks.
* Boards on the building may have &quot;tally marks&quot; cut into them which were numbers used to keep track of quantities of lumber (timber).
* Other markings in old buildings are called &quot;ritual marks&quot;, which were often signs the occupants felt would protect them from harm.

===Tools===
Many historic hand tools used by timber framers for thousands of years have similarities, but vary in shape. Electrically powered tools first became available in the 1920s in the U.S. and continue to evolve. See the list of timber framing tools for basic descriptions and images of unusual tools (The list is incomplete at this time).

===British tradition===

Some of the earliest known timber houses in Europe have been found in Great Britain, dating to Neolithic times; Balbridie and Fengate are some of the rare examples of these constructions.

Molded plaster ornamentation, pargetting further enriched some English Tudor architecture houses. Half-timbering is characteristic of English vernacular architecture in East Anglia, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire, where one of the most elaborate surviving English examples of half-timbered construction is Little Moreton Hall.

In South Yorkshire, the oldest timber house in Sheffield, the &quot;Bishops&#x27; House&quot; (c. 1500), shows traditional half-timbered construction.

In the Weald of Kent and Sussex, the half-timbered structure of the Wealden hall house, consisted of an open hall with bays on either side and often jettied upper floors.

Half-timbered construction traveled with British colonists to North America in the early 17th century but was soon abandoned in New England and the mid-Atlantic colonies for clapboard facings (an East Anglia tradition). The original English colonial settlements, such as Plymouth, Massachusetts and Jamestown, Virginia had timber-framed buildings, rather than the log cabins often associated with the American frontier. Living history programs demonstrating the building technique are available at both these locations.

One of the surviving streets lined with almost-touching houses is known as The Shambles, York, and is a popular tourist attraction.

===English styles===
&quot;For Timber-framed houses in Wales see:&quot; Architecture of Wales

Historic timber-frame construction in England (and the rest of the United Kingdom) showed regional variation which has been divided into the &quot;eastern school&quot;, the &quot;western school&quot;, and the &quot;northern school&quot;, although the characteristic types of framing in these schools can be found in the other regions (except the northern school). A characteristic of the eastern school is close studding which is a half-timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart (for example six-inch studs spaced six inches apart) until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time. Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges, stars, crosses, quatrefoils, , and many other shapes. The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam, the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern.

As houses were modified to cope with changing demands there sometimes were a combination of styles within a single timber-frame construction. The major types of historic framing in England are &#x27;cruck frame&#x27;, box frame, and aisled construction. From the box frame, more complex framed buildings such as the Wealden House and Jettied house developed.

The cruck frame design is among the earliest, and was in use by the early 13th century, with its use continuing to the present day, although rarely after the 18th century. Since the 18th century however, many existing cruck structures have been modified, with the original cruck framework becoming hidden. Aisled barns are of two or three aisled types, the oldest surviving aisled barn being the barley barn at Cressing Temple dated to 1205–1235.

Jettying was introduced in the 13th century and continued to be used through the 16th century.

Generally speaking, the size of timbers used in construction, and the quality of the workmanship reflect the wealth and status of their owners. Small cottages often used quite small cross-section timbers which would have been deemed unsuitable by others. Some of these small cottages also have a &#x27;home-made&#x27; – even temporary – appearance. Many such example can be found in the English shires. Equally, some relatively small buildings can be seen to incorporate substantial timbers and excellent craftsmanship, reflecting the relative wealth and status of their original owners. Important resources for the study of historic building methods in the UK are open-air museums.

It is often claimed that timber-framed buildings in Britain contain reused ships&#x27; timbers. This belief is dismissed by experts, who point out that curved timbers are rarely suitable, that salt is destructive to cellulose in the wood, and that ships&#x27; timbers are generally slight compared to cruck trusses.

===French tradition===

Elaborately half-timbered houses of the 13th through 18th centuries still remain in Bourges, Tours, Troyes, Rouen, Thiers, Dinan, Rennes, and many other cities, except in Provence and Corsica. Timber framing in French is known colloquially as &#x27; and half-timbering as &#x27;. Alsace is the region with the most timbered houses in France.

The &quot;Normandy tradition&quot; features two techniques: frameworks were built of four evenly spaced regularly hewn timbers set into the ground (&#x27;) or into a continuous wooden sill (&#x27;) and mortised at the top into the plate. The openings were filled with many materials including mud and straw, wattle and daub, or horsehair and gypsum.

===German tradition (&quot;Fachwerkhäuser&quot;)===

Germany has several styles of timber framing, but probably the greatest number of half-timbered buildings in the world are to be found in Germany and in Alsace (France). There are many small towns which escaped both war damage and modernisation and consist mainly, or even entirely, of half-timbered houses.


The German Timber-Frame Road (&quot;&quot;) is a tourist route that connects towns with remarkable &quot;fachwerk&quot;. It is more than long, crossing Germany through the states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Hesse, Thuringia, Bavaria, and Baden-Württemberg.

Some of the more prominent towns (among many) include: Quedlinburg, a UNESCO-listed town, which has over 1200 half-timbered houses spanning five centuries; Goslar, another UNESCO-listed town; Hanau-Steinheim (home of the Brothers Grimm); Bad Urach; Eppingen (&quot;Romance city&quot; with a half-timbered church dating from 1320); Mosbach; Vaihingen an der Enz and nearby UNESCO-listed Maulbronn Abbey; Schorndorf (birthplace of Gottlieb Daimler); Calw; Celle; and Biberach an der Riß with both the largest medieval complex, the &quot;Holy Spirit Hospital&quot; and one of Southern Germany&#x27;s oldest buildings, now the Braith-Mali-Museum, dated to 1318.

German &quot;fachwerk&quot; building styles are extremely varied with a huge number of carpentry techniques which are highly regionalized. German planning laws for the preservation of buildings and regional architecture preservation dictate that a half-timbered house must be authentic to regional or even city-specific designs before being accepted.

A brief overview of styles follows, as a full inclusion of all styles is impossible.

In general the northern states have &quot;fachwerk&quot; similar to that of the nearby Netherlands and England while the more southerly states (most notably Bavaria and Switzerland) have more decoration using timber because of greater forest reserves in those areas. During the 19th century, a form of decorative timber-framing called &quot;bundwerk&quot; became popular in Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol.

The German &quot;fachwerkhaus&quot; usually has a foundation of stone, or sometimes brick, perhaps up to several feet (a couple of metres) high, which the timber framework is mortised into or, more rarely, supports an irregular wooden sill.

The three main forms may be divided geographically:
* West Central Germany and Franconia:
** In West Central German and Franconian timber-work houses (particularly in the Central Rhine and Moselle): the windows most commonly lie between the rails of the sills and lintels.
* Northern Germany, Central Germany and East German:
** In Saxony and around the Harz foothills, angle braces often form fully extended triangles.
** Lower Saxon houses have a joist for every post.
** Holstein fachwerk houses are famed for their massive 12-inch (30 cm) beams.
* Southern Germany including the Black and Bohemian Forests
** In Swabia, Württemberg, Alsace, and Switzerland, the use of the lap-joint is thought to be the earliest method of connecting the wall plates and tie beams and is particularly identified with Swabia. A later innovation (also pioneered in Swabia) was the use of tenons – builders left timbers to season which were held in place by wooden pegs (&quot;i.e.,&quot; tenons). The timbers were initially placed with the tenons left an inch or two out of intended position and later driven home after becoming fully seasoned.

The most characteristic feature is the spacing between the posts and the high placement of windows. Panels are enclosed by a sill, posts, and a plate, and are crossed by two rails between which the windows are placed—like &quot;two eyes peering out&quot;.

In addition there is a myriad of regional scrollwork and fretwork designs of the non-loadbearing large timbers (braces) peculiar to particularly wealthy towns or cities.

A unique type of timber-frame house can be found in the region where the borders of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland meet – it is called the Upper Lusatian house (Umgebindehaus, translates as &quot;round-framed house&quot;). This type has a timber frame surrounding a log structure on part of the ground floor.

===Italy===
Several half-timbered houses can be found in Northern Italy, especially in Piedmont, Lombardy, in the city of Bologna, in Sardinia in the Barbagia region and in the Iglesiente mining region.

===Poland===
Historically, the majority of Polish cities as well as their central marketplaces possessed timber-framed dwellings and housing. Throughout the Middle Ages it was customary in Poland to use either bare brick or wattle and daub () as filling in-between the timber frame. However, the half-timbered houses which can be observed nowadays have been built in regions that were historically German or had significant German cultural influence. As these regions were at some point parts of German Prussia, half-timbered walls are often called (lit. Prussian wall) in Polish. A distinctive type of house associated with mostly Mennonite immigrant groups from Frisia and the Netherlands, known as the Olędrzy, is called an &quot;arcade house&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The biggest timber-framed religious buildings in Europe are the Churches of Peace in southwestern Poland. There are also numerous examples of timber-framed secular structures such as the granaries in Bydgoszcz.

The Umgebindehaus rural housing tradition of south Saxony (Germany) is also found in the neighboring areas of Poland, particularly in the Silesian region.

Another world-class type of wooden building Poland shares with some neighboring countries are its wooden church buildings.

===Spain===
The Spanish generally follow the Mediterranean forms of architecture with stone walls and shallow roof pitch. Timber framing is often of the post and lintel style. Castile and León, par example La Alberca, and the Basque Country have the most representative examples of the use of timber framing in the Iberian Peninsula.

Most traditional Basque buildings with half-timbering elements are detached farm houses (in Basque: baserriak). Their upper floors were built with jettied box frames in close studding. In the oldest farmsteads and, if existing, in the third floor the walls were sometimes covered with vertical weatherboards. Big holes were left in the gable of the main façade for ventilation. The wooden beams were painted over, mostly in dark red. The vacancies were filled in with wattle and daub or rubble laid in a clay mortar and then plastered over with white chalk or nogged with bricks. Although the entire supporting structure is made of wood, the timbering is only visible on the main façade, which is generally oriented to the southeast.

Although the typical Basque house is now mostly associated with half-timbering, the outer walls and the fire-walls were built in masonry (rubble stone, bricks or, ideally, ashlars) whenever it could be afforded. Timber was a sign of poverty. Oak-wood was cheaper than masonry: that is why, when the money was running out, the upper floor walls were mostly built timbered. Extant baserriak with half-timbered upper-floor façades were built from the 15th to 19th centuries and are found in all Basque regions with oceanic climate, except in Zuberoa (Soule), but are concentrated in Lapurdi (Labourd).

Some medieval Basque tower houses () feature an overhanged upper floor in half-timbering.

To a lesser extent timbered houses are also found in villages and towns as row houses, as the photo from the Uztaritz village shows.

Currently, it has again become popular to build houses resembling old Basque farmsteads, with more or less respect for the principles of traditional half-timbered building.

===Switzerland===

Switzerland has many styles of timber framing which overlap with its neighboring countries.

===Belgium===
Nowadays, timber framing is primarily found in the provinces of Limburg, Liège, and Luxembourg. In urban areas, the ground floor was formerly built in stone and the upper floors in timber framing. Also, as timber framing was seen as a cheaper way of building, often the visible structures of noble houses were in stone and bricks, and the invisible or lateral walls in timber framing. The open-air museums of Bokrijk and Saint-Hubert (Fourneau Saint-Michel) show many examples of Belgian timber framing. Many post-and-beam houses can be found in cities and villages, but, unlike France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, there are few fully timber framed cityscapes.

===Denmark===
Timber frame (&quot;bindingsværk&quot;, literally &quot;binding work&quot;) is the traditional building style in almost all of Denmark, making it the only Nordic country where this style is prevalent in all regions. Along the west coast of Jutland, houses built entirely of bricks were traditionally more common due to lack of suitable wood. In the 19th and especially in the 20th century, bricks have been the preferred building material in all of Denmark, but traditional timber-frame houses remain common both in the towns and in the countryside. Different regions have different traditions as to whether the timber frame should be tarred and thus clearly visible or be limewashed or painted in the same colour as the infills.

===Sweden===
The Swedish mostly built log houses but they do have traditions of several types of timber framing: Some of the following links are written in Swedish. Most of the half-timbered houses in Sweden were built during the Danish time and are located in what until 1658 used to be Danish territory in southern Sweden, primarily in the province Skåne and secondarily in Blekinge and Halland. In Swedish half-timber is known as .
* Stave construction is called . Scandinavia is famous for its ancient stave churches. Stave construction is a traditional timber frame with walls of vertical planks, the posts and planks landing in a sill on a foundation. Similar construction with earthfast posts is called . and Palisade construction where many vertical wall timbers or planks have their feet buried in the ground called post in ground or earthfast construction is called . (see also Palisade church)
* Swedish plank-frame construction is called . This is a traditional timber frame with walls of horizontal planks.

===Norway===
Norway has at least two significant types of timber-framed structures: the stave church and . The term &quot;stave&quot; (a post or pole) indicates that a &quot;stave church&quot; essentially means a framed church, a distinction made in a region where log building is common. All but one surviving stave churches are in Norway, one in Sweden. Replicas of stave churches and other Norwegian building types have been reproduced elsewhere, e.g. at the Scandinavian Heritage Park in North Dakota, United States.

&quot;Grindverk&quot; translates as &quot;trestle&quot; construction, consisting of a series of transversal frames of two posts and a connecting beam, supporting two parallel wall plates bearing the rafters. Unlike other types of timber framing in Europe, the trestle frame construction uses no mortise and tenon joints. Archaeological excavations have uncovered similar wooden joints from more than 3,000 years ago, suggesting that this type of framing is an ancient unbroken tradition. Grindverk buildings are only found on part of the western coast of Norway, and most of them are boathouses and barns.

Log building was the common construction used for housing humans and livestock in Norway from the Middle Ages until the 18th century. Timber framing of the type used in large parts of Europe appeared occasionally in late medieval towns, but never became common, except for the capital Christiania. After a fire in 1624 in Oslo, King Christian IV ordered the town to be relocated to a new site. He outlawed log building to prevent future conflagrations and required wealthy burghers to use brickwork and the less affluent to use timber framing in the Danish manner. During the next two centuries, 50 per cent of the houses were timber framed.

All of these buildings disappeared as a consequence of this small provincial town of Christiania becoming the capital of independent Norway in 1814. This caused a rapid growth, with the population rising from 10 000 to 250 000 by 1900. Increasing prices caused a massive urban renewal, which resulted in all wooden structures being replaced with office blocks.

===Netherlands===

The Netherlands is often overlooked for its timbered houses, yet many exist, including windmills. It was in North Holland where the import of cheaper timber, combined with the Dutch innovation of windmill-powered sawmills, allowed economically viable widespread use of protective wood covering over framework. In the late 17th century the Dutch introduced vertical cladding also known in Eastern England as clasp board and in western England as weatherboard, then as more wood was available more cheaply, horizontal cladding in the 17th century. Perhaps owing to economic considerations, vertical cladding returned to fashion. Dutch wall framing is virtually always built in bents and the three basic types of roof framing are the rafter roof, purlin roof, and ridge-post roof.

===Romania===
Half-timbered houses can be found in Romania mostly in areas once inhabited by Transylvanian Saxons, in cities, towns and villages with Germanic influence such as Bistrița, Brașov, Mediaș, Sibiu and Sighișoara. However the number of half-timbered houses is small. In Wallachia there are few examples of this type of architecture, most of those buildings being located in Sinaia, such as the Peleș Castle.

===Baltic states ===
As the result of centuries of German settlement and cultural influence, towns in the Baltic states such as Klaipėda and Riga also preserve German-style Fachwerkhäuser.

===Americas===

Most &quot;haft-timbered&quot; houses existing in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas were built by German settlers. Old Salem North Carolina has fine examples of German fachwerk buildings. Many are still present in Colonia Tovar (Venezuela), Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), where Germans settled. Later, they chose more suitable building materials for local conditions (most likely because of the great problem of tropical termites.)

====New France====
In the historical region of North America known as New France, colombage pierroté, also called &quot;maçonnerie entre poteaux&quot;, half-timbered construction with the infill between the posts and studs of stone rubble and lime plaster or bousillage and simply called &quot;colombage&quot; in France. Colombage was used from the earliest settlement until the 18th century but was known as &quot;bousillage entre poteaus sur solle&quot; in Lower Louisiana. The style had its origins in Normandy, and was brought to Canada by early Norman settlers. The Men&#x27;s House at Lower Fort Garry is a good example. The exterior walls of such buildings were often covered over with clapboards to protect the infill from erosion. Naturally, this required frequent maintenance, and the style was abandoned as a building method in the 18th century in Québec. For the same reasons, half-timbering in New England, which was originally employed by the English settlers, fell out of favour soon after the colonies had become established.

Other variations of half-timbering are &quot;colombage à teurques&quot; (torchis), straw coated with mud and hung over horizontal staves (or otherwise held in place), colombage an eclisses, and colombage a lattes.

Poteaux-en-terre (posts in ground) is a type of timber framing with the many vertical posts or studs buried in the ground called post in ground or &quot;earthfast&quot; construction. The tops of the posts are joined to a beam and the spaces between are filled in with natural materials called bousillage or pierrotage.

Poteaux-sur-sol (posts on a sill) is a general term for any kind of framing on a sill. However, sometimes it specifically refers to &quot;vertical log construction&quot; like poteaux-en-terre placed on sills with the spaces between the timbers infilled.

Piece-sur-piece, also known as Post-and-plank style or &quot;corner post construction&quot; (and many other names) in which wood is used both for the frame and horizontal infill; for this reason it may be incorrect to call it &quot;half-timbering&quot;. It is sometimes a blend of framing and log building with two styles: the horizontal pieces fit into groves in the posts and can slide up and down or the horizontal pieces fit into individual mortises in the posts and are pegged and the gaps between the pieces chinked (filled in with stones or chips of wood covered with mud or moss briefly discussed in Log cabin.)

This technique of a timber frame walls filled in with horizontal planks or logs proved better suited to the harsh climates of Québec and Acadia, which at the same time had abundant wood. It became popular throughout New France, as far afield as southern Louisiana. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company used this technique for many of its trading posts, and this style of framing becoming known as Hudson Bay style or Hudson Bay corners. Also used by the Red River Colony this style also became known as &quot;Red River Framing&quot;. &quot;The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age.&quot; Similar building techniques are apparently not found in France but exist in Germany and Switzerland known as &quot;Bohlenstanderbau&quot; when planks are used or &quot;blockstanderbau&quot; when beams are used as the infill. In Sweden the technique is known as &quot;&quot; or and in Denmark as &quot;bulhus&quot;.

A particularly interesting example in the U.S. is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, Pennsylvania, which has the ground level of corner-post construction with the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features.

Settlers in New France also built horizontal log, brick, and stone buildings.

====New Netherland====
Characteristics of traditional timber framing in the parts of the U.S. formerly known as New Netherland are H-framing also known as dropped-tie framing in the U.S. and the similar anchor beam framing as found in the New World Dutch barn.

====New England====
Some time periods/regions within New England contain certain framing elements such as common purlin roofs, five sided ridge beams, plank-frame construction and plank-wall construction. The English barn always contains an &quot;English tying joint&quot; and the later New England style barn were built using bents.

===Japanese===

Japanese timber framing is believed to be descended from Chinese framing (see Ancient Chinese wooden architecture). Asian framing is significantly different from western framing, with its predominant use of post and lintel framing and an almost complete lack of diagonal bracing.

===Revival styles in later centuries===

When half-timbering regained popularity in Britain after 1860 in the various revival styles, such as the Queen Anne style houses by Richard Norman Shaw and others, it was often used to evoke a &quot;Tudor&quot; atmosphere (&quot;see Tudorbethan&quot;), though in Tudor times half-timbering had begun to look rustic and was increasingly limited to village houses (&quot;illustration, above left&quot;).

In 1912, Allen W. Jackson published &quot;The Half-Timber House: Its Origin, Design, Modern Plan, and Construction,&quot; and rambling half-timbered beach houses appeared on dune-front properties in Rhode Island or under palm-lined drives of Beverly Hills. During the 1920s increasingly minimal gestures towards some half-timbering in commercial speculative housebuilding saw the fashion diminish.

In the revival styles, such as Tudorbethan (Mock Tudor), the half-timbered appearance is superimposed on the brickwork or other material as an outside decorative façade rather than forming the main frame that supports the structure.

The style was used in many of the homes built in Lake Mohawk, New Jersey, as well as all of the clubhouse, shops, and marina.

==Advantages==
The use of timber framing in buildings offers various aesthetic and structural benefits, as the timber frame lends itself to open plan designs and allows for complete enclosure in effective insulation for energy efficiency. In modern construction, a timber-frame structure offers many benefits:
* It is rapidly erected. A moderately sized timber-frame home can be erected within 2 to 3 days.
* It is well suited to prefabrication, modular construction, and mass-production. Timbers can be pre-fit within bents or wall-sections and aligned with a jig in a shop, without the need for a machine or hand-cut production line. This allows faster erection on site and more precise alignments. Valley and hip timbers are not typically pre-fitted.
* As an alternative to the traditional infill methods, the frame can be encased with SIPs. This stage of preparing the assembled frame for the installation of windows, mechanical systems, and roofing is known as &quot;drying in&quot;.
* it can be customized with carvings or incorporate heirloom structures such as barns etc.
* it can use recycled or otherwise discarded timbers.
* it offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better &quot;seismic survivability&quot; Consequently, there are many half-timbered houses which still stand despite the foundation having partially caved in over the centuries.
* The generally larger spaces between the frames enable greater flexibility in the placement, at construction or afterwards, of windows and doors with less resulting weakening of the structural integrity and the need for heavy lintels.

In North America, heavy timber construction is classified Building Code Type IV: a special class reserved for timber framing which recognizes the inherent fire resistance of large timber and its ability to retain structural capacity in fire situations. In many cases this classification can eliminate the need and expense of fire sprinklers in public buildings.

==Disadvantages==
===Traditional or historic structures===
In terms of the traditional half-timber or &quot;fachwerkhaus&quot; there are maybe more disadvantages than advantages today. Such houses are notoriously expensive to maintain let alone renovate and restore, most commonly owing to local regulations that do not allow divergence from the original, modification or incorporation of modern materials.
Additionally, in such nations as Germany, where energy efficiency is highly regulated, the renovated building may be required to meet modern energy efficiencies, if it is to be used as a residential or commercial structure (museums and significant historic buildings have no semi-permanent habitade exempt). Many framework houses of significance are treated merely to preserve, rather than render inhabitable – most especially as the required heavy insecticidal fumigation is highly poisonous.

In some cases, it is more economical to build anew using authentic techniques and correct period materials than restore. One major problem with older structures is the phenomenon known as &quot;mechano-sorptive creep&quot; or slanting: where wood beams absorb moisture whilst under compression or tension strains and deform, shift position or both. This is a major structural issue as the house may deviate several degrees from perpendicular to its foundations (in the x-axis, y-axis, and even z-axis) and thus be unsafe and unstable or so out of square it is extremely costly to remedy.

A summary of problems with &quot;Fachwerkhäuser&quot; or half-timbered houses includes the following, though many can be avoided by thoughtful design and application of suitable paints and surface treatments and routine maintenance. Often, though when dealing with a structure of a century or more old, it is too late.
* &quot;slanting&quot;- &quot;thermo-mechanical&quot; (weather-seasonally induced) and mechano-sorptive (moisture induced) creep of wood in tension and compression.
* poor prevention of capillary movement of water within any exposed timber, leading to afore-described creep, or rot
* eaves that are too narrow or non-existent (thus allowing total exposure to rain and snow)
* too much exterior detailing that does not allow adequate rainwater run-off
* timber ends, joints, and corners poorly protected through coatings, shape or position
* non-beveled vertical beams (posts and clapboards) allow water absorption and retention through capillary action.
* surface point or coatings allowed to deteriorate
* traditional gypsum, or wattle and daub containing organic materials (animal hair, straw, manure) which then decompose.
* in both &quot;poteaux-en-terre&quot; and &quot;poteaux-sur-sol&quot;, insect, fungus or bacterial decomposition.
* rot including dry rot.
* infestation of xylophagous pest organisms such as (common in Europe) the &quot;Ptinidae&quot; family, particularly the common furniture beetle, termites, cockroaches, powderpost beetles, mice, and rats (quite famously so in many children&#x27;s stories).
* Noise from footsteps in adjacent rooms above, below, and on the same floor in such buildings can be quite audible. This is often resolved with built-up floor systems involving clever sound-isolation and absorption techniques and at the same time providing passage space for plumbing, wiring, and even heating and cooling equipment.
* Other fungi that are non-destructive to the wood but are harmful to humans, such as black mold. These fungi may also thrive on many &quot;modern&quot; building materials.
* Wood burns more readily than some other materials, making timber-frame buildings somewhat more susceptible to fire damage, although this idea is not universally accepted: Since the cross-sectional dimensions of many structural members exceed 15 cm × 15 cm (6&quot; × 6&quot;), timber-frame structures benefit from the unique properties of large timbers, which char on the outside, forming an insulated layer that protects the rest of the beam from burning.
* prior flood or soil subsidence damage

<text>Loren Dean (born July 31, 1969) is an American actor. He has appeared on stage and in feature films, including as the title character in &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, as well as &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Rosewood&quot;, &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;, and &quot;Ad Astra&quot;. He appeared in a recurring role on the television series &quot;Bones&quot;.

==Early life==
Loren Dean Jovicic was born July 31, 1969, in Las Vegas, Nevada to Elayne (née Rosoff) and Jovicic. His parents divorced when he was a small child. His mother won custody of Loren, and the family moved to Los Angeles, California. When visiting his father, the two often went to the movies—which Dean says led to his love of film. His childhood was a difficult one, and he ran away from home when he was 16 years old. He graduated from Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, in 1986.

Dean moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After two years, a friend introduced him to an agent, and he began appearing in stage plays in New York. He won a Theatre World Award in 1989 for his Off Broadway debut in the play &quot;Amulets Against the Dragon Forces&quot; at the Circle Repertory Company. He is a playwright and one of Academy Award-winning screenwriter John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s favorite actors, having appeared in many of the author&#x27;s plays, notably &quot;4 Dogs and a Bone&quot; and &quot;Beggars in the House of Plenty&quot;.

Dean became an animal lover during his time in New York.

==Career==
Dean&#x27;s first film was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Plain Clothes&quot;. He made his big break a year later, cast as a bad ex-boyfriend in &quot;Say Anything...&quot; starring John Cusack. His third film, the 1991 crime drama &quot;Billy Bathgate,&quot; cast him with Nicole Kidman, Dustin Hoffman and Bruce Willis.

Dean was lauded for his role as a cocaine-addicted, has-been movie star who is accidentally re-launched on the road to fame and fortune by a fan in &quot;Starstruck&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that Dean &quot;nails his role with precision&quot;. He was lauded for his performance as a mysterious small-town psychologist in &quot;Mumford&quot; (1999).

Much of his acting career has been in supporting roles. His films include &quot;Apollo 13&quot; (1995), &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), and &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000). Dean has appeared in independent films including &quot;The War Bride&quot; and &quot;The Poker Club&quot;, and several well-received television miniseries including &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;). He played Russ, the brother of Temperance &quot;Bones&quot; Brennan on the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;. He had a recurring role on the 2010 crime drama &quot;Terriers&quot;. In 2011, Dean starred in the made-for-television movie &quot;Who Is Simon Miller?&quot; The film, which aired on NBC, was financed by Procter &amp; Gamble and Walmart as one of their quarterly &quot;Family Movie Night&quot; films. Each film is designed to present wholesome values with almost no violence, sex, or drug use.

Dean has supported filmmakers behind the scenes as well. In 1999, he was a juror for the third annual Shorts International Film Festival.

==Impersonated by conman==
Loren Dean has been repeatedly impersonated by suspected con artist Loren Dean Breckenridge III. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department in Orange County, California, has accused Breckenridge of impersonating Dean and defrauding drug rehabilitation centers across the United States, as well as committing the theft of $75,000 in Marin County, California. Breckenridge was arrested for impersonating White Zombie drummer Phil Buerstatte.

<text>The Joy Luck Club is a 1989 novel written by Amy Tan. It focuses on four Chinese immigrant families in San Francisco who start a mahjong club known as The Joy Luck Club. The book is structured similarly to a mahjong game, with four parts divided into four sections to create sixteen chapters. The three mothers and four daughters (one mother, Suyuan Woo, dies before the novel opens) share stories about their lives in the form of short vignettes. Each part is preceded by a parable relating to the themes within that section.

In 1993, the novel was adapted into a feature film directed by Wayne Wang and starring Ming-Na Wen, Lauren Tom, Tamlyn Tomita, France Nguyen, Rosalind Chao, Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, Lisa Lu, and Vivian Wu. The screenplay was written by the author Amy Tan along with Ronald Bass. The novel was also adapted into a play, by Susan Kim, which premiered at Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in New York.

==Plot==

&quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; consists of sixteen interlocking stories about the lives of four Chinese immigrant mothers and their four American-born daughters. In 1949, the four mothers meet at the First Chinese Baptist Church in San Francisco and agree to continue to meet to play mahjong. They call their mahjong group the Joy Luck Club. The stories told in this novel revolve around the Joy Luck Club women and their daughters. Structurally, the novel is divided into four major sections, with two sections focusing on the stories of the mothers and two sections on the stories of the daughters.

===Feathers from a Thousand Li Away===
The first section, &quot;Feathers from a Thousand Li Away&quot;, introduces the Joy Luck Club through daughter Jing-Mei &quot;June&quot; Woo, whose late mother Suyuan Woo founded the Joy Luck Club, and focuses on the four mothers. June relates the story of how her mother Suyuan was the wife of an officer in the Kuomintang during World War II and how she was forced to flee from her home in Kweilin and abandon her twin daughters. Suyuan later found out that her first husband died. She later married Canning Woo and immigrated to the United States where their daughter, June, was born. Suyuan and Canning attempted to find Suyuan&#x27;s daughters, and Canning assumed that Suyuan had given up hope. June, who has been asked to take her mother&#x27;s place in the Joy Luck Club, learns from the other mothers that her half-sisters are alive. They ask that June go to China and meet her sisters, and tell them about Suyuan&#x27;s death.

The other three mothers relate the stories of their childhood. An-Mei Hsu&#x27;s story relates how her mother left her family to become the third concubine of Wu Tsing, a rich merchant, while An-Mei was raised by her maternal grandmother. Her mother returns only to cut off a piece of her flesh to cook a soup in hopes of healing An-Mei&#x27;s grandmother, though An-Mei&#x27;s grandmother still dies.

Lindo Jong explains how in childhood she was forced into a loveless marriage and was pressured by her mother-in-law&#x27;s desire for Lindo to produce grandchildren. Through her own ingenuity, Lindo fabricates a convincing story to annul her marriage and emigrate to the United States.

The final story of the first section follows Ying-Ying St. Clair, who tells the story of how she fell into a lake during the Zhongqiujie festival when she was only four. After being rescued by a group of fishermen, she realizes that she is lost. This experience emotionally traumatizes her, and she is dropped at the shore, and wanders into an outdoor performance featuring the Moon Lady, said to grant wishes. But when Ying-Ying approaches the Moon Lady after the play to wish to be returned to her family, she discovers the Moon Lady is played by a man.

===Twenty-Six Malignant Gates===
The second section traces the childhoods of the Joy Luck children. In the first story, Waverly Jong talks about how she started playing chess, first with her brothers and then with old men in the playground near her school. At the age of nine, she becomes a national chess champion. She is embarrassed when her mother, Lindo, introduces her to everyone she meets, showing her off like a trophy and seeming to take the credit for her daughter&#x27;s brilliance. This leads to an angry confrontation between the two of them.

Lena relates the stories her mother told her when she was younger (her great grandfather sentenced a beggar to die in the worst possible manner). Lena&#x27;s family moves to North Beach from Oakland. Her mother, who seems restless, delivers an anencephalic child who dies at birth. In Lena&#x27;s eyes, her mother becomes a &#x27;living ghost&#x27;. The story of their neighbors and the relationship between the mother and the daughter of the neighboring household is also mentioned. 

Rose Hsu Jordan wishes to tell her mother that she plans to divorce her husband Ted. She reflects on their relationship. She then goes on to relate an incident in which her family (her parents and six siblings) go to the beach. Her youngest brother, Bing, falls into the ocean when her other brothers fight. She returns along with her mother An-Mei to search for Bing, but in vain.

The last story is that of June Woo and the pressure that her mother puts on her to perform exceedingly well in some field (to be a child prodigy). She begins to learn to play the piano but does not perform well in a concert and stops playing. This disappoints her mother because she wanted her to be a great pianist and June shows no interest in being anything else but herself. Around her 30th birthday, Suyuan presents her an old piano which she used to play as a child. Although June admits she had forgotten how to play the piano, Suyuan encourages her to try again. She admits to June that she still has the talent to be a great pianist, but self-doubt holds her back.

===American Translation===

The third section follows the Joy Luck children as adult women, all facing various conflicts. In Lena&#x27;s story, she narrates her troubling marital problems and how she fears being inferior to her husband, Harold Livotny. She does not realize he has taken advantage of her both at home and at work, where he is also her boss and earns much more than her. Ying-Ying is very much aware of this. She pointed out how Lena knew a table would crumble yet did nothing to stop it, symbolizing that her marriage will crumble because it has a weak foundation. Lena finally admits she is not happy in her marriage to Harold and is lost inside. Ying-Ying encourages her to stop being passive and stand up to her husband or nothing will change.

Waverly Jong worries about her mother&#x27;s opinion of her white fiancé, Rich, and recalls quitting chess after becoming angry at her mother in the marketplace. She believes that her mother will still have absolute power over her and will object to her forthcoming marriage to Rich, after she did the same to her previous husband, Marvin Chen, with whom she has a daughter, Shoshana. After a disastrous attempt at a dinner party to tell her mother of their wedding, Waverly confronts her mother the morning afterwards and realizes that her mother has known all along about her relationship with Rich and has accepted him.

Rose Hsu Jordan learns that Ted intends to marry someone else after divorcing her. She realizes through her mother&#x27;s advice that she needs to fight for her rights and refuses to sign the conditions set forth by his divorce papers. She hires a good lawyer and wins possession of the house, forcing Ted to take her more seriously.

In June&#x27;s story, June has an argument with Waverly at a Chinese New Year&#x27;s dinner the year before the story begins. Realizing that June has been humiliated, Suyuan gives her a special jade pendant called &quot;life&#x27;s importance&quot;, which she has worn since June was an infant. June regrets that she never learned the meaning of the pendant&#x27;s name. She also confronts Suyuan with the belief that she had always been disappointed in June and admitted she could never live up to her high expectations. June believes that because she has never finished college, does not have a good career, and remains unmarried, she is seen as a failure in her mother&#x27;s eyes. Suyuan eventually reveals her true meaning; that while Waverly has style, she lacks the kind and generous heart that June has. She also tells June that she understands the frustrations of never being good enough in her eyes and admits she is proud of June.

===Queen Mother of the Western Skies===
The final section of the novel, the title of which refers to the Chinese goddess Xi Wangmu, returns to the viewpoints of the mothers as adults dealing with difficult choices. An-Mei reveals what happened after her grandmother died, she angered her relatives by leaving with her mother. They return to the home where her mother lived as the abused fourth concubine of Wu Tsing, whose second concubine manipulates and controls the household and has taken An-Mei&#x27;s half-brother as her son. An-Mei learns how her mother was forced into accepting her position after Wu Tsing&#x27;s second wife arranged for An-Mei&#x27;s mother to be raped and shamed. When she came to her family for help, they cruelly turned their backs on her mother and told her to leave. An-Mei finds her mother has poisoned herself two days before Chinese New Year, knowing that Wu Tsing&#x27;s superstitious beliefs will ensure An-Mei will grow up in favorable conditions.

During the funeral, An-Mei takes her younger half-brother and forces Wu Tsing to honor both them and their deceased mother out of fear of him being haunted by their mother&#x27;s ghost. The angry Second Wife attempts to dispute her claims and tries to discredit her. An-Mei quickly makes an example of her by destroying the fake pearl necklace that she originally gave to her, which exposes her cruelty and manipulation. This causes the Second Wife to realize that she has lost control of the household and brought trouble on herself, so she backs down. Fearing bad karma on the way, Wu Tsing honors both An-Mei and her brother as his children and their mother as his favorite First Wife.

Ying-Ying St. Clair reveals how her first husband, a womanizer, abandoned her and how she married an American man she did not love after relinquishing her sense of control in her life. She later took back her sense of control when she finally had a talk with Lena and convinced her to leave Harold.

Lindo Jong relates how she arrived in San Francisco and met An-Mei Hsu when they both worked at a fortune-cookie factory, which eventually gave her the means to plant the idea of marriage in her boyfriend&#x27;s head.

The novel&#x27;s final episode returns to June, and her mother&#x27;s desire to find her lost twin daughters. June and her father fly to China, where June meets her half-sisters and embraces her Chinese heritage. In doing so, she was finally able to make peace with Suyuan.

==Characters==

===Mothers===
====Suyuan Woo====
During the Second World War, Suyuan lives in the Republic of China while her husband at the time served as an officer in Chungking (Chongqing). She starts the original Joy Luck Club with her three friends to cope with the War. There is little to eat, but they pretend it is a feast, and talk about their hopes for the future. On the day of the Japanese invasion, Suyuan leaves her house with nothing but a bag of clothes, a bag of food, and her twin baby daughters.

During the long journey, Suyuan contracts such severe dysentery that she feels certain she will die. Fearing that a dead mother would doom her babies&#x27; chances of rescue, she reluctantly and emotionally leaves her daughters under a barren tree, together with all her belongings, along with a note asking anyone who might find the babies to care for them and contact the father. Suyuan then departs, expecting to die. However, she is rescued by a truck and finds out her husband has died. She later remarries, goes to America, and forms a new Joy Luck Club with three other Chinese female immigrants she met at church. She gives birth to another daughter, but her abandonment of her twin girls haunts her for the rest of her life. After many years, Suyuan learns that the twins were adopted, but dies of a brain aneurysm before she can meet them. It is her American-born daughter Jing-mei who fulfills her long-cherished wish of reuniting with them.

As Suyuan dies before the novel begins, her history is told by Jing-mei, based on her knowledge of her mother&#x27;s stories, anecdotes from her father, and what the other members of the Joy Luck Club tell her.

====An-Mei Hsu====
An-Mei is raised by her grandparents and other relatives during her early years in Ningbo after her widowed mother shocks the family by becoming a concubine to a middle-aged wealthy man after her first husband&#x27;s death. This becomes a source of conflict for the young An-Mei, as her aunts and uncles deeply resent her mother for such a dishonorable act. They try to convince An-Mei that it is not fitting for her to live with her disgraced mother, who is now forbidden to enter the family home. An-Mei&#x27;s mother, however, still wishes to be part of her daughter&#x27;s life. After An-Mei&#x27;s grandmother dies, An-mei moves out to live with her mother in the home of her mother&#x27;s new husband, Wu-Tsing, much to the disagreement of her relatives who insists she remains at home with them.

An-Mei learns that her mother was coerced into being Wu-Tsing&#x27;s concubine through the manipulations of his Second Wife, the favourite. This woman arranged for An-Mei&#x27;s mother, still in mourning for her original husband, to be raped by Wu-Tsing. When her mother came to her family for their assistance, they cruelly refused and disowned her. The stigma left An-Mei&#x27;s mother with no choice but to marry Wu-Tsing and become his new but lowly Fourth Wife. She later lost her baby son to Second Wife, who claimed the boy as her own child to ensure her place in the household. Second Wife also tried to win over An-mei upon her arrival in Wu-Tsing&#x27;s mansion, giving her a necklace made of &quot;pearls&quot; that her mother later revealed were actually glass beads, by crushing one with her teacup. An-Mei&#x27;s mother re-knots the necklace to hide the missing bead, but now An-Mei knows the truth about Second Wife&#x27;s seeming generosity.
Wu-Tsing is a highly superstitious man, and Second Wife takes advantage of this weakness by making false suicide attempts and threatening to haunt him as a ghost if he does not let her have her way. According to Chinese tradition, a person&#x27;s soul comes back after three days to settle scores with the living. Wu-Tsing, therefore, is known to be afraid to face the ghost of an angry or scorned wife. After Second Wife fakes a suicide attempt to prevent An-Mei and her mother from getting their own small house, An-Mei&#x27;s mother successfully commits suicide herself, eating tangyuan laced with lethal amounts of opium. Also taking advantage of Wu Tsing&#x27;s beliefs, she times her death so that her soul is due to return on the first day of the Lunar New Year, a day when all debts must be settled lest the debtor suffer great misfortune. An-Mei takes her younger brother&#x27;s arm and demands that Wu Tsing honor them and her mother or face great consequences. When Second Wife attempts to dispute this at the funeral rites, An-Mei quickly makes an example of her and shows her awareness of Second Wife&#x27;s deceptions by crushing the fake pearl necklace under her feet. This symbolizes her new power over the woman who made her mother&#x27;s life miserable. She did this by abusing her and taking her brother away. Now fearing An-Mei, Second Wife realizes the bad karma she has brought upon herself and backs down, having lost control of the house. With this in mind, Wu-Tsing promises to treat his Fourth Wife&#x27;s children, including An-Mei, as if they were his very own flesh and blood and their mother as his honored First Wife.

An-Mei later immigrates to America, marries, and gives birth to seven children (four sons, three daughters). The youngest, a son named Bing, drowns at age four.

====Lindo Jong====
Lindo is a strong-willed woman, a trait that her daughter Waverly attributes to her having been born in the year of the Horse. When Lindo was only twelve, she was forced to move in with a neighbor&#x27;s young son, Huang Tyan Yu, through the machinations of the village matchmaker. After some training for household duties through her in-laws, she and Tyan-yu married when she turned sixteen. She soon realized that her husband was a mere boy at heart and had no sexual interest in her. It is loosely implied that he might have been gay. Lindo began to care for her husband as a brother, but her cruel mother-in-law expected Lindo to produce a grandson. She restricted most of Lindo&#x27;s daily activities, eventually ordering her to remain on bed rest until she could conceive and deliver a child.

Determined to escape this unfortunate situation, Lindo carefully observed the other people in the household and eventually formed a clever plan to escape her marriage without dishonoring herself, her family and her in-laws. She managed to convince her in-laws that Huang Tyan Yu was actually fated to marry another girl who was already pregnant with his &quot;spiritual child&quot;, and that her own marriage to him would only bring bad luck to the family. The girl she described as his destined wife was, in fact, a mere servant in the household, indeed pregnant but abandoned by her lover. Seeing this as an opportunity for her to be married and live comfortably, the servant girl cheerfully agreed with Lindo.

Freed from her first marriage, Lindo decided to immigrate to America. She married a Chinese American man named Tin Jong and has three children: sons Winston and Vincent, and daughter Waverly.

Lindo experiences regret over losing some of her Chinese identity by living so long in America (she is treated like a tourist on a visit to China); however, she expresses concern that Waverly&#x27;s American upbringing has formed a barrier between them.

====Ying-Ying &quot;Betty&quot; St. Clair====
From a young age, Ying-Ying is told by her wealthy and conservative family that Chinese girls should be meek and gentle. This is especially difficult for her, as she feels it out of step with her character as a Tiger. She begins to develop a passive personality and represses her feelings as she grows up in Wuxi. Ying-Ying marries a charismatic man named Lin Xiao not out of love, but because she believed it was her fate. Her husband is revealed to be abusive and openly has extramarital affairs with other women. When Ying-Ying discovers she is pregnant, she has an abortion. She then decides to live with her relatives in a smaller city in China.

After ten years, she moves to Shanghai and works in a clothing store, where she meets an American man named Clifford St. Clair. He falls in love with her, but Ying-Ying cannot express any strong emotion after her first marriage. He courts her for four years, and she agrees to marry him after learning that Lin Xiao had died, which she takes as the proper sign to move on. She allows Clifford to control most aspects of her life; he mistranslates her words and actions, and even changes her name to &quot;Betty&quot;. Ying-Ying gives birth to her daughter, Lena, after moving to San Francisco with St. Clair. When Lena is around ten years old, Ying-Ying becomes pregnant a third time, but the baby boy is anencephalic and soon dies.

Ying-Ying is horrified when she realises that Lena, a Tiger like herself, has inherited or emulated her passive behaviors and trapped herself in a loveless marriage with a controlling husband. She finally resolves to call upon the more assertive qualities of her Tiger nature, to appeal to those qualities in Lena. She will tell Lena her story in the hope that she will be able to break free from the same passivity that ruined most of her young life back in China.

===Daughters===
====Jing-Mei &quot;June&quot; Woo====
Jing-Mei, commonly called &quot;June&quot;, has never fully understood her mother and seems directionless in life. During June&#x27;s childhood, her mother used to tell her that she could be anything she wants; however, she particularly wanted her daughter to be gifted, a child star who amazes the world, like Ginny Tiu (seen briefly on television) or June&#x27;s rival Waverly. At the beginning of the novel, June is chosen to replace her mother&#x27;s seat in the Joy Luck Club after her mother&#x27;s death. At the end of the novel, June is still trying to deal with her mother&#x27;s death, and she visits China to see the twin half-sisters (Wang Chwun Yu and Wang Chwun Hwa) whom her mother had been forced to abandon when the Japanese attacked China. Only when she visits China to meet her half-sisters and tell them about their mother, June finally accepts her Chinese heritage and makes her peace with her mother.

One critic has suggested that the reason for the communication gap between June and her mother, and between the other daughters and their mothers—a major theme of the novel—occurs because the mothers come from a high context culture and the Americanized daughters from a low context culture. The mothers believe that the daughters will intuitively understand their cryptic utterances, but the daughters don&#x27;t understand them at all.

====Rose Hsu Jordan====
Rose is somewhat passive and is a bit of a perfectionist. She had an unsettling childhood experience when her youngest brother, Bing, drowned while she was supposed to be watching him, and his body was never recovered. Rose marries a doctor, Ted Jordan, who loves her but also wants to spite his snooty, racist mother. After a malpractice suit, Ted has a mid-life crisis and decides to leave Rose. Rose confides in her mother and An-mei tells her the story of her own childhood. When Ted comes for the divorce papers, Rose finds her voice and tells him that he can&#x27;t just throw her out of his life, comparing herself to his garden, once so beloved, now unkempt and full of weeds. An-Mei tells her that Ted has been cheating on her, which Rose thinks is absurd, but she later discovers this to be true. She hires a good lawyer and fights for possession of the house, which she eventually wins. This forces Ted to take Rose more seriously and not continue taking her for granted. It&#x27;s unknown if they ever reconciled.

====Waverly Jong====

Waverly is an independent-minded and intelligent woman, but is annoyed by her mother&#x27;s constant criticism. Well into her adult life, she finds herself restrained by her subconscious fear of letting her mother down. During their childhood, June and Waverly become childhood rivals; their mothers constantly compared their daughters&#x27; development and accomplishments. Waverly was once a gifted chess champion, but quit after feeling that her mother was using her daughter&#x27;s talent to show off, taking credit for Waverly&#x27;s wins. Waverly does not necessarily understand the origin of her mother&#x27;s comments or what context for which they are intended. Waverly is “unable to feel at home in… [her] relationship with [her] mother.&quot;

She has a daughter, Shoshana, from her first marriage with Marvin Chen, and she is engaged to her boyfriend Rich Schields. When Waverly believes that Lindo will object to her engagement to Rich after a failed dinner party, she discovers her mother had already accepted it.

====Lena St. Clair====
Throughout Lena&#x27;s childhood, she gradually becomes her mother&#x27;s voice and interprets her mother&#x27;s Chinese words for others. Like her father Clifford, she translates Ying-ying&#x27;s words to sound more pleasant than what Ying-ying actually says. Ying-ying has taught Lena to beware of consequences, to the extent that Lena visualizes disaster in the taking of any risk. Lena&#x27;s husband, Harold, is also her boss. He takes the credit for Lena&#x27;s business and design ideas. He demands financial &quot;equality&quot; in their marriage. Lena is an associate while Harold is a partner, so he has a larger salary than she does. However, he insists that all household expenses be divided equally between them. Harold believes that by making everything equal, they can make their love equal as well. Lena feels frustrated and powerless. She settles for what Harold tells her is right: “in Chinese society…the man is the one who creates the rules and the woman… has no choice [except] obeying these rules.&quot; Harold&#x27;s act of dictatorship over Lena could be the reason for her created self-doubt: &quot;in…patriarchy, men possess the highest status... so that women&#x27;s position is subordinate to them.&quot; She is like her mother, like a ghost, and her mother wants to help her regain her spirit and stand up for herself. When Ying-Ying breaks a leg from a table belonging to Harold, Lena finally admitted she&#x27;s unhappy in her marriage including how frustrated she is with him for taking credit for her business and design ideas. Ying-Ying encourages her to leave Harold and not come back until he treats her with more respect.

==Reception==
While &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; earned high praise, it also received criticism for perpetuating racist stereotypes about Asian Americans. Literary figures such as Chinese American author Frank Chin said that it depicted Chinese culture as backwards, cruel, and misogynistic. He attributed the popularity of &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; to playing up racist stereotypes welcomed in mainstream America. He also noted that it lacks authenticity for its fabricated Chinese folk tales that depict &quot;Confucian culture as seen through the interchangeable Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese mix (depending on which is the yellow enemy of the moment) of Hollywood.&quot;

Harvard Crimson writer, Allen Soong, reflected that &quot;while the women ... are fully fleshed-out characters who are a remarkable improvement over the &#x27;exotic Oriental&#x27; Cassandra from &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, the male characters are merely additions to the long list of negative images of Asian men in our culture.&quot;

Novelist Nancy Willard, in a somewhat positive critique, said that &quot;Amy Tan&#x27;s special accomplishment in this novel is not her ability to show us how mothers and daughters hurt each other, but how they love and ultimately forgive each other.&quot;

The act of losing individuality continues through multiple generations because the mothers in Tan&#x27;s story &quot;never offer concrete anecdotes to teach [their daughters]&quot; about their feelings and their pasts. The daughters spend a large portion of their lives feeling lost and trying to understand their place in society. Their &quot;search for an essential Chinese identity... always frustrate[d] their attempts to understand... their identities.&quot;

Carolyn See of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the novel a positive review, stating &quot;The only negative thing I could ever say about this book is that I&#x27;ll never again be able to read it for the first time.&quot;

<text>The Gaslamp Quarter is a historic neighborhood in downtown San Diego, California. It extends from Broadway to Harbor Drive and from 4th to 6th Avenue. The neighborhood is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as the Gaslamp Quarter Historic District. It includes over 90 historic buildings, most of which were constructed in the Victorian era; many are in use as restaurants, shops, entertainment venues, and nightclubs.

The Gaslamp Quarter is known for its nightlife. It is the site of various events and festivals, including Mardi Gras in the Gaslamp, Taste of Gaslamp, and ShamROCK, a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day event. Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, is one block away in the East Village neighborhood.

==History==

In the 1860s, the area was known as New Town, in contrast to Old Town, the original Spanish colonial settlement of San Diego. Intensive development began in 1867, when Alonzo Horton bought the land in hopes of creating a new city center closer to the bay, and chose 5th Avenue as its main street.

After a period of urban decay, the neighborhood underwent urban renewal in the 1980s and 1990s.

It was rebranded the &quot;Gaslamp Quarter&quot; during the redevelopment and preservation efforts that occurred during the 1980s, though the streets were generally lit by arc lights, not gaslamps.

==Timeline==
*1850: William Heath Davis bought in what would eventually become the Gaslamp Quarter. Despite heavy investment from Davis, little development happened in this period.
*1867: Real estate developer Alonzo Horton arrived in San Diego and purchased of land in New Town for $265. Major development began in the Gaslamp Quarter.

*1880s to 1916: Known as the Stingaree, the area was a working class area, home to San Diego&#x27;s first Chinatown, &quot;Soapbox Row&quot; and many saloons, gambling halls, and bordellos.
*1912: Stingaree was the site of a free speech fight between socialists and city politicians which led to riots and the abduction by vigilantes of Emma Goldman&#x27;s husband.
*1916: the entire neighborhood of Stingaree was demolished and renamed by anti-vice campaigners.
*1950s-1970s: The decaying Gaslamp Quarter became known as a &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; district, with a high concentration of pornographic theaters, bookshops and massage parlors.
*1970: Public interest in preserving buildings downtown started, especially in Gaslamp Quarter.
*1976: The city adopted the Gaslamp Quarter Urban Design and Development Manual, aimed at preserving buildings in the area, and the redevelopment of Gaslamp Quarter as a national historic district.
*1982: Gaslamp Quarter became the major focus of the redevelopments in downtown by the city of San Diego.
*1992: Gaslamp Quarter Archway is installed and dedicated.

<doc id="699432" wikidata="Q886165" url="?curid=699432" title="Myers Y. Cooper">
<text>Myers Young Cooper (November 25, 1873 – December 6, 1958) was an American Republican politician and businessman from Ohio. Cooper was the 51st governor of Ohio.

Born In St. Louisville, Ohio, the youngest of eleven children, Cooper had a public school education, and attended the National Normal University in Lebanon, Ohio for three years. In 1893, at age 20, he joined his brothers in Cincinnati in a large real-estate and homebuilding business. On December 15, 1897, he married Martha Kinney. His business interests also included lumber, building supplies and banking. After losing in 1926, he won election to the governorship in 1928, serving from 1929 to 1931.

The defining feature of his term was the beginning of the Great Depression in October 1929, which was exacerbated by a drought the following summer that pummeled the Ohio farm economy. Cooper largely echoed the Hoover Administration&#x27;s calls for calm and efforts to speed up previously-planned public works spending which represented the conventional view of how to respond to sudden downturns. Local committees were created to aid in finding jobs of the unemployed but this effort largely proved ineffective as the crisis intensified.

Cooper was nominated without opposition in 1930, but lost to George White. Cooper&#x27;s tepid response to the developing Great Depression led to a collapse in voter turnout - about 20 percent fewer votes were cast compared with the 1928 election. White won despite winning fewer votes than Democratic candidate Martin Davey collected two years previously. Cooper unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for governor again in 1932, his last bid for office.

In 1929 Cooper signed a one-cent increase in the state gas tax which was estimated to produce $8.5 million in additional funds for road and bridge work. His administration also authorized the start of construction on the State Office Building to house agencies scattered in rented space around Columbus. The building on Front Street is now home to the Ohio Supreme Court. Cooper also faced a major crisis when a fire at the Ohio Penitentiary on April 21, 1930 killed 322 inmates. The fire led to legislative efforts to ease overcrowding and the establishment of a state parole board.

In mid-to-late 1920s, Cooper was associated with South Florida real estate developer and politician George E. Merrick. Cooper was involved with Merrick&#x27;s Village Project developments in Coral Gables, Florida that would later impact and inspire the architecture of Cincinnati homes in the 1930s-50s.

His former home is now the grounds for Clark Montessori High School.

Cooper Arena at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds in Columbus, Ohio, was named in honor of Cooper.

<doc id="699433" wikidata="Q449894" url="?curid=699433" title="Theodore Roosevelt Jr.">
<text>Theodore Roosevelt III ( ; September 13, 1887 – July 12, 1944), often known as Theodore Jr., was an American military officer, politician and businessman. He was the eldest son of President Theodore Roosevelt and First Lady Edith Roosevelt. Roosevelt is known for his World War II service, including the directing of troops at Utah Beach during the Normandy landings, for which he received the Medal of Honor.

Roosevelt was educated at private academies and Harvard University; after his 1909 graduation from college, he began a successful career in business and investment banking. Having gained pre–World War I army experience during his attendance at a Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camp, at the start of the war he received a reserve commission as a major. He served primarily with the 1st Division, took part in several engagements including the Battle of Cantigny, and commanded the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry as a lieutenant colonel. After the war, Roosevelt was instrumental in the forming of The American Legion.

In addition to his military and business careers, Roosevelt was active in politics and government. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1921–1924), Governor of Puerto Rico (1929–1932), and Governor-General of the Philippines (1932–1933). He resumed his business endeavors in the 1930s, and was Chairman of the Board of American Express Company, and vice-president of Doubleday Books. Roosevelt also remained active as an Army reservist, attending annual training periods at Pine Camp, and completing the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, the Command and General Staff College, and refresher training for senior officers. He returned to active duty for World War II with the rank of colonel, and commanded the 26th Infantry. He soon received promotion to brigadier general as assistant division commander of the 1st Infantry Division.

After serving in the Operation Torch landings in North Africa and the Tunisia Campaign, followed by participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily, Roosevelt was assigned as assistant division commander of the 4th Infantry Division. In this role, he led the first wave of troops ashore at Utah Beach during the Normandy landings in June 1944. He died in France of a heart attack the following month at 56 years old. At the time of his death, he had been recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross to recognize his heroism at Normandy. The recommendation was subsequently upgraded, and Roosevelt was a posthumous recipient of the Medal of Honor.

==Childhood==
Mr. Roosevelt, Jr. was the eldest son of President Theodore Roosevelt and First Lady Edith Kermit Carow. He was born at the family estate in Cove Neck on September 13, 1887, Oyster Bay, New York, when his father was just starting his political career. As a son of President Theodore Roosevelt, he has been referred to as &quot;Jr&quot;, but he was actually Theodore III and one of his own sons was Theodore IV. His siblings were brothers Kermit, Archie, and Quentin; sister Ethel; and half-sister Alice. As an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, and through his ancestor Cornelius Van Schaack Jr., Ted was a descendant of the Schuyler family.

Like all the Roosevelt children, Ted was tremendously influenced by his father. In later life, Ted recorded some of these childhood recollections in a series of newspaper articles written around the time of World War I. One day when he was about nine, his father gave him a rifle. When Ted asked if it were real, his father loaded it and shot a bullet into the ceiling.

When Ted was a child, his father initially expected more of him than of his siblings. The burden almost caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown.

In one article, Ted recalled his first time in Washington, &quot;...when father was civil service commissioner I often walked to the office with him. On the way down he would talk history to me—not the dry history of dates and charters, but the history where you yourself in your imagination could assume the role of the principal actors, as every well-constructed boy wishes to do when interested. During every battle we would stop and father would draw out the full plan in the dust in the gutter with the tip of his umbrella. Long before the European war had broken over the world father would discuss with us military training and the necessity for every man being able to take his part.&quot;

==Education and early business career==
The Roosevelt boys attended private schools; Ted went to The Albany Academy, and then Groton School. Before he went to college, he thought about going to military school. Although not naturally called to academics, he persisted and graduated from Harvard College in 1909, where, like his father, he joined the Porcellian Club.

After graduating from college, Ted entered the business world. He took positions in the steel and carpet businesses before becoming branch manager of an investment bank. He had a flair for business and amassed a considerable fortune in the years leading up to World War I and on into the 1920s. The income generated by his investments positioned him well for a career in politics after the War.

==World War I==
All the Roosevelt sons, except Kermit, had some military training prior to World War I.
With the outbreak of World War I in Europe in August 1914, American leaders had heightened concern about their nation&#x27;s readiness for military engagement. Only the month before, Congress had authorized the creation of an Aviation Section in the Signal Corps. In 1915, Major General Leonard Wood, President Roosevelt&#x27;s former commanding officer during the Spanish–American War, organized a summer camp at Plattsburgh, New York, to provide military training for business and professional men, at their own expense.

This summer training program provided the base of a greatly expanded junior officers&#x27; corps when the United States entered World War I. During that summer, many well-heeled young men from some of the finest east coast schools, including three of the four Roosevelt sons, attended the military camp. When the United States entered the war, in April 1917, the armed forces offered commissions to the graduates of these schools based on their performance. The National Defense Act of 1916 continued the student military training and the businessmen&#x27;s summer camps. It placed them on a firmer legal basis by authorizing an Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC).

After the United States declaration of war on Germany, when the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was organizing, Theodore Roosevelt wired Major General John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, the newly appointed commander of the AEF, asking if his sons could accompany him to Europe as privates. Pershing accepted, but, based on their training at Plattsburgh, Archie was offered a commission with rank of second lieutenant, while Ted was offered a commission and the rank of major. Quentin had already been accepted into the Army Air Service. Kermit volunteered with the British in the area of present-day Iraq.

With a reserve commission in the army (like Quentin and Archibald), soon after World War I started, Ted was called up. When the United States declared war on the German Empire, Ted volunteered to be one of the first soldiers to go to the Western Front. There, he was recognized as the best battalion commander in his division, according to the division commander. Roosevelt braved hostile fire and gas and led his battalion in combat. So concerned was he for his men&#x27;s welfare that he purchased combat boots for the entire battalion with his own money. He eventually commanded the 26th Regiment in the 1st Division as a lieutenant colonel. He fought in several major battles, including America&#x27;s first victory at the Battle of Cantigny.

Ted was gassed and wounded at Soissons during the summer of 1918. In July of that year, his youngest brother Quentin was killed in combat. Ted received the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the war, which ended on November 11, 1918 at 11:00 am. France conferred upon him the Chevalier Légion d&#x27;honneur on March 16, 1919. Before the troops came home from France, Ted was one of the founders of the soldiers&#x27; organization that developed as The American Legion. The American Legion &quot;Post Officers Guide&quot; recounts Ted&#x27;s part in the organization&#x27;s founding:

When the American Legion met in New York City, Roosevelt was nominated as its first national commander, but he declined, not wanting to be thought of as simply using it for political gain. In his view, acceptance under such circumstances could have discredited the nascent organization and himself and harmed his chances for a future in politics.

Ted resumed his reserve service between the wars. He attended the annual summer camps at Pine Camp and completed both the Infantry Officer&#x27;s Basic and Advanced Courses, and the Command and General Staff College. By the beginning of World War II, in September 1939, he was eligible for senior commissioned service.

In 1919 he became a member of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==Political career==

After service in World War I, Roosevelt began his political career. Grinning like his father, waving a crumpled hat, and like his father, shouting &quot;bully&quot;, he participated in every national campaign that he could, except when he was Governor-General of the Philippines. Elected as a member of the New York State Assembly (Nassau County, 2nd D.) in 1920 and 1921, Roosevelt was one of the few legislators who opposed the expulsion of five Socialist assemblymen in 1920. Anxiety about Socialists was high at the time.

On March 10, 1921, Roosevelt was appointed by President Warren G. Harding as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He oversaw the transferring of oil leases for federal lands in Wyoming and California from the Navy to the Department of Interior, and ultimately, to private corporations. Established as the Navy&#x27;s petroleum reserves by President Taft, the properties consisted of three oil fields: Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3, Teapot Dome Field, Natrona County, Wyoming; and Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 at Elk Hills Oil Field and Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 2 Buena Vista Oil Field, both in Kern County, California. In 1922, Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased the Teapot Dome Field to Harry F. Sinclair of Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company, and the field at Elk Hills, California, to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum &amp; Transport Company, both without competitive bidding.

During the transfers, while Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, his brother Archie was vice president of the Union Petroleum Company, the export auxiliary subsidiary of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil. The leasing of government reserves without competitive bidding, plus the close personal and business relationships among the players, led to the deal being called the Teapot Dome scandal. The connection between the Roosevelt brothers could not be ignored.

After Sinclair sailed for Europe to avoid testifying in Congressional hearings, G. D. Wahlberg, Sinclair&#x27;s private secretary, advised Archibald Roosevelt to resign to save his reputation. The Senate Committee on Public Lands held hearings over a period of six months to investigate the actions of Fall in leasing the public lands without the required competitive bidding. Although both Archibald and Ted Roosevelt were cleared of all charges by the Senate Committee on Public Lands, their images were tarnished.

At the 1924 New York state election, Roosevelt was the Republican nominee for Governor of New York. His cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) spoke out on Ted&#x27;s &quot;wretched record&quot; as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the oil scandals. In return, Ted said of FDR: &quot;He&#x27;s a maverick! He does not wear the brand of our family.&quot; Eleanor Roosevelt, more closely related to Ted by blood but married to FDR, had been infuriated by these remarks. She dogged Ted on the New York State campaign trail in a car fitted with a &quot;papier-mâché&quot; bonnet shaped like a giant teapot that was made to emit simulated steam, and countered his speeches with those of her own, calling him immature.

She would later decry these methods, admitting that they were below her dignity but saying that they had been contrived by Democratic Party &quot;dirty tricksters.&quot; Ted&#x27;s opponent, incumbent governor Alfred E. Smith, defeated him by 105,000 votes. Ted never forgave Eleanor for her stunt, though his elder half-sister Alice did, and resumed their formerly close friendship. These conflicts served to widen the split between the Oyster Bay (TR) and Hyde Park (FDR) wings of the Roosevelt family.

==Governor of Puerto Rico==
Along with his brother, Kermit, Roosevelt spent most of 1929 on a zoological expedition and was the first Westerner known to have shot a panda. In September 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Roosevelt as Governor of Puerto Rico, and he served until 1932. (Until 1947, when it became an electoral office, this was a political appointee position.) Roosevelt worked to ease the poverty of the people during the Great Depression. He attracted money to build secondary schools, raised money from American philanthropists, marketed Puerto Rico as a location for manufacturing, and made other efforts to improve the Puerto Rican economy.

He worked to create more ties to U.S. institutions for mutual benefit. For instance, he arranged for Cayetano Coll y Cuchi to be invited to Harvard Law School to lecture about Puerto Rico&#x27;s legal system. He arranged for Antonio Reyes Delgado of the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to speak to a conference of Civil Service Commissioners in New York City. Roosevelt worked to educate Americans about the island and its people, and to promote the image of Puerto Rico in the rest of the U.S.

Roosevelt was the first American governor to study Spanish and tried to learn 20 words a day. He was fond of local Puerto Rican culture and assumed many of the island&#x27;s traditions. He became known as &quot;El Jíbaro de La Fortaleza&quot; (&quot;The Hillbilly of the Governor&#x27;s Mansion&quot;) by locals. In 1931 he appointed Carlos E. Chardón, a mycologist, as the first Puerto Rican to be Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico.

==Governor-General of the Philippines==
Impressed with his work in Puerto Rico, President Hoover appointed Roosevelt as Governor-General of the Philippines in 1932. During his time in office, Roosevelt acquired the nickname &quot;One Shot Teddy&quot; among the Filipino population, in reference to his marksmanship during a hunt for tamaraw (wild pygmy water buffalo).

In the 1932 United States presidential election, when Franklin D. Roosevelt challenged Hoover for the presidency, Alice begged Ted to return from the Philippines to aid the campaign. Roosevelt announced to the press on August 22, 1932, that &quot;Circumstances have made it necessary for me to return for a brief period to the United States... I shall start for the Philippines again the first week in November... While there I hope I can accomplish something.&quot;

The reaction of many in the U.S. press was so negative that within a few weeks, Governor-General Roosevelt arranged to stay in Manila throughout the campaign. U.S. Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley cabled Ted, &quot;The President has reached the conclusion that you should not leave your duties for the purpose of participating in the campaign... He believes it to be your duty to remain at your post.&quot; Roosevelt resigned as Governor-General after the election of FDR as president, as the new administration would appoint their own people. He thought that the potential for war in Europe meant another kind of opportunity for him. Using his father&#x27;s language, he wrote to his wife as he sailed for North Africa, saying that he had done his best and his fate was now &quot;at the knees of the gods&quot;.

==Return to the U.S. mainland==
During the 1932 presidential campaign of his cousin FDR, Roosevelt said, &quot;Franklin is such poor stuff it seems improbable that he should be elected President.&quot; When Franklin won the election and Ted was asked just how he was related to FDR, Ted quipped &quot;fifth cousin, about to be removed.&quot;

In 1935, he returned to the United States and first became a vice president of the publishing house Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company. He next served as an executive with American Express. He also served on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations. He was invited by Irving Berlin to help oversee the disbursement of royalties for Berlin&#x27;s popular song, &quot;God Bless America,&quot; to charity. While living again in New York, the Roosevelts renewed old friendships with playwright Alexander Woollcott and comedian Harpo Marx.

He was also mentioned as a potential candidate for the 1936 Republican presidential nomination, but did not mount a campaign. Had he received the 1936 Republican presidential nomination, he would have faced off against his cousin Franklin in the general election. After Alf Landon received the Republican presidential nomination, Roosevelt was also mentioned as a candidate for vice president, but that nomination went to Frank Knox. Roosevelt was also mentioned as a candidate for Governor of New York in 1936, but made no effort to become an active candidate.

==World War II service and death==
In 1940, during World War II (although the United States had not yet entered the war and remained neutral) Roosevelt attended a military refresher course offered to many businessmen as an advanced student, and was promoted to colonel in the Army of the United States.

Roosevelt&#x27;s wife personally asked Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to return him to a combat unit despite his past hospitalization. Although Marshall typically refused such political favoritism he remarked that he would make an exception &quot;if what you wanted was a more dangerous job than what you had&quot; and agreed. Roosevelt returned to active duty in April 1941 and was given command of the 26th Infantry Regiment, part of the 1st Infantry Division, the same unit he fought with in World War I. Late in 1941, he was promoted to brigadier general.

===North Africa===
Upon his arrival in North Africa, Roosevelt became known as a general who often visited the front lines. He had always preferred the heat of the battle to the comfort of the command post, and this attitude would culminate in his actions in France on D-Day.

Roosevelt led the 26th Infantry in an attack on Oran, Algeria, on November 8, 1942, as part of Operation Torch, the Allies&#x27; invasion of North Africa. During 1943, he was the Assistant Division Commander (ADC) of the 1st Infantry Division in the campaign in North Africa under Major General Terry Allen. He was cited for the Croix de Guerre by the military commander of French Africa, General Alphonse Juin: 

===Clashes with Patton===
Roosevelt collaborated with and was a friend of his commander, the hard-fighting, hard-drinking Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Their unorthodox approach to warfare did not escape the attention of Lieutenant General George S. Patton, the Seventh Army commander in Sicily, and formerly the II Corps commander. Patton disapproved of such officers who &quot;dressed down&quot; and were seldom seen in regulation field uniforms, and who placed little value in Patton&#x27;s spit-shined ways in the field. Patton thought them both un-soldierly for it and wasted no opportunity to send derogatory reports on Allen to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). Roosevelt was also treated by Patton as &quot;guilty by association&quot; for his friendship and collaboration with the highly unorthodox Allen. When Allen was relieved of command of the 1st Division and reassigned, so was Roosevelt.

After criticizing Allen in his diary on July 31, 1943, Patton noted that he had asked permission of Eisenhower &quot;to relieve both Allen and Roosevelt on the same terms, on the theory of rotation of command&quot;, and added, concerning Roosevelt, &quot;there will be a kick over Teddy, but he has to go, brave but otherwise, no soldier.&quot; Later, however, upon hearing of the death of Roosevelt, Patton wrote in his diary that Roosevelt was &quot;one of the bravest men I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;, and a few days later served as a pallbearer at his funeral.

Roosevelt was also criticized by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, the II Corps commander, who ultimately relieved both Roosevelt and Allen. In both of his autobiographies – &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story (1951)&quot; and &quot;A General&#x27;s Life&quot; – Bradley claimed that relieving the two generals was one of his most unpleasant duties of the war. Bradley felt that Allen and Roosevelt were guilty of &quot;loving their division too much&quot; and that their relationship with their soldiers was having a generally bad effect on the discipline of both the commanders and the men of the division.

Roosevelt was assistant commander of the 1st Infantry Division at Gela during the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, commanded Allied Forces in Sardinia, and fought on the Italian mainland. He was the chief liaison officer to the French Expeditionary Corps in Italy for General Eisenhower, and repeatedly made requests of Eisenhower for combat command.

===D-Day===
In February 1944, Roosevelt was assigned to England to help lead the Normandy invasion and appointed Deputy Division Commander of the 4th Infantry Division. After several verbal requests to the division&#x27;s Commanding General (CG), Major General Raymond &quot;Tubby&quot; Barton, to go ashore on D-Day with the Division were denied, Roosevelt sent a written petition:

Barton approved Roosevelt&#x27;s written request with much misgiving, stating that he did not expect Roosevelt to return alive.

Roosevelt was the only general on D-Day to land by sea with the first wave of troops. At 56, he was the oldest man in the invasion, and the only one whose son also landed that day; Captain Quentin Roosevelt II was among the first wave of soldiers at Omaha Beach.

Brigadier General Roosevelt was one of the first soldiers, along with Captain Leonard T. Schroeder Jr., off his landing craft as he led the 8th Infantry Regiment and 70th Tank Battalion landing at Utah Beach. Roosevelt was soon informed that the landing craft had drifted south of their objective, and the first wave of men was a mile off course. Walking with the aid of a cane and carrying a pistol, he personally made a reconnaissance of the area immediately to the rear of the beach to locate the causeways that were to be used for the advance inland. He returned to the point of landing and contacted the commanders of the two battalions, Lieutenant Colonels Conrad C. Simmons and Carlton O. MacNeely, and coordinated the attack on the enemy positions confronting them. Opting to fight from where they had landed rather than trying to move to their assigned positions, Roosevelt&#x27;s famous words were, &quot;We&#x27;ll start the war from right here!&quot;

These impromptu plans worked with complete success and little confusion. With artillery landing close by, each follow-on regiment was personally welcomed on the beach by a cool, calm, and collected Roosevelt, who inspired all with humor and confidence, reciting poetry and telling anecdotes of his father to steady the nerves of his men. Roosevelt pointed almost every regiment to its changed objective. Sometimes he worked under fire as a self-appointed traffic cop, untangling traffic jams of trucks and tanks all struggling to get inland and off the beach. One GI later reported that seeing the general walking around, apparently unaffected by the enemy fire, even when clods of earth fell down on him, gave him the courage to get on with the job, saying if the general is like that it cannot be that bad.

When Major General Barton, the commander of the 4th Infantry Division, came ashore, he met Roosevelt not far from the beach. He later wrote:

By modifying his division&#x27;s original plan on the beach, Roosevelt enabled its troops to achieve their mission objectives by coming ashore and attacking north behind the beach toward its original objective. Years later, Omar Bradley was asked to name the single most heroic action he had ever seen in combat. He replied, &quot;Ted Roosevelt on Utah Beach.&quot;

Following the landing, Roosevelt utilized a Jeep named &quot;Rough Rider&quot;, which was the nickname of his father&#x27;s regiment raised during the Spanish–American War. Before his death, Roosevelt was appointed as Military Governor of Cherbourg.

===Death===
Throughout World War II, Roosevelt suffered from health problems. He had arthritis, mostly from old World War I injuries, and walked with a cane. He also had heart trouble, which he kept secret from army doctors and his superiors.

On July 12, 1944, a little over one month after the landing at Utah Beach, Roosevelt died of a heart attack in France. He was living at the time in a converted sleeping truck, captured a few days before from the Germans. He had spent part of the day in a long conversation with his son, Captain Quentin Roosevelt II, who had also landed at Normandy on D-Day. He was stricken at about 10:00 pm, attended by medical help, and died at about midnight. He was fifty-six years old. On the day of his death, he had been selected by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, now commanding the U.S. First Army, for promotion to the two-star rank of major general and command of the 90th Infantry Division. These recommendations were sent to General Eisenhower, now the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. Eisenhower approved the assignment, but Roosevelt died before the battlefield promotion. Of his death, Patton wrote: &quot;Teddy R[oosevelt] died in his sleep last night. He had made three landings with the leading wave – such is fate... He was one of the bravest men I ever knew&quot;.

Roosevelt was initially buried at Sainte-Mère-Église. Photographs show that his honorary pallbearers were generals, including Omar N. Bradley, George S. Patton, Raymond O. Barton, Clarence R. Huebner, Courtney Hicks Hodges, and J. Lawton Collins, the VII Corps commander. Later, Roosevelt was buried at the American cemetery in Normandy, initially created for the Americans killed in Normandy during the invasion. His younger brother, Second Lieutenant Quentin Roosevelt, had been killed in action as a pilot in France during World War I and was initially buried near where he had been shot down in that war. In 1955, his family had his body exhumed and moved to the Normandy cemetery, where he was re-interred beside his brother. Ted also has a cenotaph near the grave of his parents at Youngs Memorial Cemetery in Oyster Bay, while Quentin&#x27;s original gravestone was moved to Sagamore Hill.

===Medal of Honor===
Roosevelt was originally recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross by General Barton. The recommendation was upgraded at higher headquarters to the Medal of Honor, which was approved, and which Roosevelt was posthumously awarded on September 21, 1944.

==Family==
On June 20, 1910, Roosevelt married Eleanor Butler Alexander (1888–1960), daughter of Henry Addison Alexander and Grace Green. Ted and Eleanor had four children: Grace (1911–1994), Theodore (1914–2001), Cornelius (1915–1991), and Quentin (1919–1948).

==Military awards==
General Roosevelt&#x27;s military awards include:

==Civilian honors==
Theodore Roosevelt Jr. is honored in the scientific names of two species of Caribbean lizards: &quot;Anolis roosevelti&quot; and &quot;Sphaerodactylus roosevelti&quot;. Both species were named and described in 1931 by American herpetologist Chapman Grant, a grandson of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant.

<text>A structural insulated panel, or structural insulating panel, (SIP), is a form of sandwich panel used as a building material in the construction industry.

SIP is a sandwich structured composite, consisting of an insulating layer of rigid core sandwiched between two layers of structural board. The board can be sheet metal, fibre cement, magnesium oxide board (MgO), plywood or oriented strand board (OSB), and the core can either be expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), polyisocyanurate foam, polyurethane foam, or be composite honeycomb (HSC).

The sheathing accepts all tensile forces while the core material has to withstand only some compressive as well as shear forces.

In a SIP several components of conventional building, such as studs and joists, insulation, vapor barrier and air barrier can be combined. The panel can be used for many different applications, such as exterior wall, roof, floor and foundation systems.

== History ==

Although foam-core panels gained attention in the 1970s, the idea of using stress-skinned panels for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin, as part of a U.S. Forest Service attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it endured the Wisconsin climate and was used by University of Wisconsin–Madison as a day care center until 1998, when it was removed to make way for a new Pharmacy School building. With the success of the stress-skinned panels, it was suggested stronger skins could take all the structural load and eliminate the frame altogether.

Thus in 1947, structural insulated panel development began when corrugated paperboard cores were tested with various skin materials of plywood, tempered hardboard and treated paperboard. The building was dismantled in 1978, and most of the panels retained their original strength with the exception of paperboard, which is unsuited to outdoor exposure. Panels consisting of polystyrene core and paper overlaid with plywood skins were used in a building in 1967, and the panels performed well.

SIP systems were used by Woods Constructors of Santa Paula, California, in their homes and apartments from 1965 until 1984. This work was the basis for John Thomas Woods, Paul Flather Woods, John David Woods, and Frederick Thomas Woods when they used a similar concept to patent the Footing Form for Modular homes (US Patent ) issued on April 4, 1989. Numerous homes in Santa Paula, Fillmore, Palm Springs, and surrounding areas use SIPs as the primary method of construction. The design was awarded approval from (then) ICBO and SBCCI, now ICC.

== Materials ==
SIPs are most commonly made of OSB panels sandwiched around a foam core made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) or rigid polyurethane foam. Other materials can be used in replacement of OSB, such as plywood, pressure-treated plywood for below-grade foundation walls, steel, aluminum, cement board such as Hardiebacker, and even exotic materials like stainless steel, fiber-reinforced plastic, and magnesium oxide. Some SIPs use fiber-cement or plywood sheets for the panels, and agricultural fiber, such as wheat straw, for the core.

The third component in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIPs. Dimensional lumber is commonly used but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values. To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, Mechanical Locks, Overlapping OSB Panels, or other creative methods. Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.

== Methods of manufacturing ==

SIP&#x27;s are most often manufactured in a traditional factory. Processing equipment is used to regulate pressures and heat in a uniform and consistent manner. There are two main processing methods which correspond to the materials used for the SIP core. When manufacturing a panel with a polystyrene core both pressure and heat are required to ensure the bonding glue has penetrated and set completely. Although a number of variations exist, in general, the foam core is first covered with an adhesive and the skin is set in place. The three pieces are set into a large clamping device and pressure and heat are applied. The three pieces must stay in the clamping device until the glue has cured.

When manufacturing a panel with a polyurethane core pressure and heat are both generated from the expansion of the foam during the foaming process. The skins are set in a large clamping device which functions as a mold. The skins must be held apart from each other to allow the liquid polyurethane materials to flow into the device. Once in the device, the foam begins to rise. The mold/press is generally configured to withstand the heat and the pressures generated from the chemical foaming. The SIP is left in the mold/press to cure slightly and when removed will continue to cure for several days.

Until recently, both of these processes required a factory setting. However, recent advancements have presented an alternative with SIP processing equipment that allows SIPs to be manufactured on the job-site. This is welcome news for builders in developing countries where the technology may be best suited to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve sustainability in housing but are unavailable.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
The use of SIPs brings many benefits and some drawbacks compared to a conventional framed building.

The costs of SIPs are higher than the materials for a comparable framed building in the United States; however, this may not be true elsewhere. A well-built home using SIPs will have a tighter building envelope and the walls will have higher insulating properties, which leads to fewer drafts and a decrease in operating costs. Also, due to the standardized and all-in-one nature of SIPs, construction time can be less than for a frame home, as well as requiring fewer tradespeople. The panels can be used as floor, wall, and roof, with the use of the panels as floors being of particular benefit when used above an uninsulated space below. As a result, the total life-cycle cost of a SIP-constructed building will, in general, be lower than for a conventional framed one—by as much as 40%. Whether the total construction cost (materials and labor) is lower than for conventional framing appears to depend on the circumstances, including local labor conditions and the degree to which the building design is optimized for one or the other technology.

An OSB skinned system structurally outperforms conventional stick framed construction in some cases; primarily in axial load strength. SIPs maintain similar versatility to stick framed houses when incorporating custom designs. Also, since SIPs work as framing, insulation, and exterior sheathing, and can come precut from the factory for the specific job, the exterior building envelope can be built quite quickly. SIPs panels also tend to be lightweight and compact which aids this offsite construction. The environmental performance of SIPs, moreover, is very good due to their exceptional thermal insulation. They also offer a resistance to damp and cold problems like compression shrinkage and cold bridging that cannot be matched by timber and more traditional building materials.

When tested under laboratory conditions, the SIP, included in a wall, foundation, floor, or roof system, is installed in a steady-state (no air infiltration) environment; systems incorporating fiberglass insulation are not installed in steady-state environments as they require ventilation to remove moisture.

With the exception of structural metals, such as steel, all structural materials creep over time. In the case of SIPs, the creep potential of OSB faced SIPs with EPS or polyurethane foam cores has been studied and creep design recommendations exist. The long-term effects of using unconventional facing and core materials require material specific testing to quantify creep design values.

== Dimensions and characteristics ==
In the United States, SIPs tend to come in sizes from in width. Elsewhere, typical product dimensions are 300, 600, or 1,200 mm wide and 2.4, 2.7, and 3 m long, with roof SIPs up to 6 m long. Smaller sections ease transportation and handling, but the use of the largest panel possible will create the best insulated building. At 15−20 kg/m2, longer panels can become difficult to handle without the use of a crane to position them, and this is a consideration that must be taken into account due to cost and site limitations. Also of note is that when needed for special circumstances longer spans can often be requested, such as for a long roof span. Typical U.S. height for panels is . Panels come in widths ranging from thick and a rough cost is $4–$6/ft2 in the U.S. In 4Q 2010, new methods of forming radius, sine curve, arches and tubular SIPs were commercialized. Due to the custom nature and technical difficulty of forming and curing specialty shapes, pricing is typically three or four times that of standard panels per foot.

EPS is the most common of the foams used and has an R-value (thermal resistance) of about 4 °F·ft2·h/Btu (equivalent to about 0.7 K·m2/W) per 25 mm thickness, which would give the of foam in a panel an R value of 13.8 (caution: extrapolating R-values over thickness may be imprecise due to non-linear thermal properties of most materials). This at face value appears to be comparable to an R-13 batt of fiberglass, but because in a standard stick frame house there is significantly more wall containing low R value wood that acts as a cold bridge, the thermal performance of the R-13.8 SIP wall will be considerably better.

The air sealing features of SIP homes resulted in the US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s Energy Star program to establish an inspection protocol in lieu of the typically required blower door test to assess the home&#x27;s air leakage. This serves to speed the process and save the builder/homeowner money.

== Standardization and design ==
The International Building Code references APA, Plywood Design Specification 4—Design &amp; Fabrication of Plywood Sandwich Panels for the design of SIPs. This document addressed the basic engineering mechanics of SIPs but does not provide design properties for the panels provided by any specific manufacturer. In 2007, prescriptive design provisions for OSB faced SIPs were first introduced in the 2006 International Residential Code. These provisions provide guidance on the use of SIPs as walls panels only.

Aside from these non-proprietary standards, the SIP industry has relied heavily on proprietary code evaluation reports. In early 2009, SIPA partnered with ICC NTA, LLC, a third-party product evaluation certification agency, to produce the first industry wide code report which is available to all SIPA members who qualify. Unlike previous code reports, the prescriptive provisions provided in the SIPA code report are derived from an engineering design methodology which permits the design professional to consider loading conditions not addressed in the code report.

<doc id="699441" wikidata="Q17005227" url="?curid=699441" title="Avidyā (Hinduism)">
<text>Avidyā is a Sanskrit word that can translate as ignorance, misconceptions, misunderstandings, or incorrect knowledge; it is the opposite of &quot;Vidya&quot;. It is used extensively in Hindu texts, including the Upanishads, and in other Indian religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, particularly in the context of metaphysical reality.

Avidyā, in all Dharmic systems, represents fundamental ignorance and misperception of the phenomenal world. However, the Indian religions disagree on the details, for example with Hinduism considering a denial and misconceptions of Atman (soul, self) as a form of Avidya, and Buddhism considering the denial and misconceptions of An-atman (non-soul, non-self) as a form of Avidya.

== Etymology and meaning ==
&quot;Avidyā&quot; (अविद्या) is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;vidya&quot;, meaning &quot;not vidya&quot;. The word &quot;vidya&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;Vid&quot;, which means &quot;to know, to perceive, to see, to understand&quot;. Therefore, &quot;avidya&quot; means to &quot;not know, not perceive, not understand&quot;. The &quot;Vid*&quot;-related terms appears extensively in the Rigveda and other Vedas. Avidya is usually rendered as &quot;ignorance&quot; in English translations of ancient Indian texts, sometimes as &quot;spiritual ignorance&quot;.

The word avidyā is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;weid&quot;-, meaning &quot;to see&quot; or &quot;to know&quot;. It is a cognate of Latin &quot;vidēre&quot; (which would turn to &quot;video&quot;) and English &quot;wit&quot;.

While Avidya found in Indian philosophies is translated as &quot;ignorance&quot;, states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because Avidya means more than ignorance. He suggests the term &quot;unwisdom&quot; to be a better rendition. The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions). Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman.

Avidya represents fundamental ignorance, state Jones and Ryan, a misperception of the phenomenal world. In Hinduism, Avidya includes confusing the mundane reality to be the only reality, and it as a permanent though it is ever changing. Its doctrines assert that there is a spiritual reality consisting of Atman-Brahman, one that is the true, eternal, imperishable reality beyond time.

==In the Vedic texts and Upanishads==
Avidya in the earliest Vedic texts is ignorance, and in later Vedic texts evolves to include anything that is a &quot;positive hindrance&quot; to spiritual or nonspiritual knowledge. In the Upanishads, the concept includes &quot;lack of knowledge, inadequate knowledge and false knowledge&quot;. 

Isha Upanishad refers to &quot;vidya&quot; and &quot;avidya&quot; in verses 9-11:

&quot;Katha Upanishad&quot; uses the metaphor of blindness to describe &quot;avidya&quot;:
Mundaka Upanishad references &quot;avidya&quot; similar to the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot; verse 2.5:

== In Yoga Darsana ==
Avidya is described in the Yoga Sutras by Patanjali, as the first of the five kleshas, the knots of affliction, and the productive field of all them that follow. In Yoga Sutras II.5, Patanjali defines Avidya as confusing the nature of the soul with the body:

:अनित्याशुचिदुःखानात्मसु नित्यशुचिसुखात्मख्यातिरविद्या॥ ५॥
:Ignorance is the notion that takes the self, which is joyful, pure, and eternal, to be the nonself, which is painful, unclean, and temporary.

In Yogra Sutras II.2, Patanjali gives Kriya yoga as a method for overcoming Avidya and other klesas.
==In Advaita Vedanta==

The effect of avidya is to suppress the real nature of things and present something else in its place. In effect it is not different from Maya (pronounced Māyā) or illusion. Avidya relates to the individual Self (&quot;Ātman&quot;), while Maya is an adjunct of the cosmic Self (&quot;Brahman&quot;). In both cases it connotes the principle of differentiation of an experienced reality into the subject (&#x27;I&#x27;) and an object, as is implicit in human thinking. Avidya stands for that delusion which breaks up the original unity (refer: nonduality) of what is real and presents it as subject and object and as doer and result of the deed. What keeps humanity captive in Samsara is this avidya. This ignorance, &quot;the ignorance veiling our true self and the truth of the world&quot;, is not lack of erudition; it is ignorance about the nature of &#x27;Being&#x27; (&quot;Sat&quot;). It is a limitation that is natural to human sensory or intellectual apparatus. This is responsible for all the misery of humanity. Advaita Vedanta holds that the eradication of it should be humanity&#x27;s only goal and that will automatically mean realisation of the Self (&quot;Ātman&quot;).

Adi Shankara says in his Introduction to his commentary on the Brahma Sutras, 
In the view of his later followers, avidya cannot be categorized either as &#x27;absolutely existent&#x27; or as &#x27;absolutely non-existent&#x27;.

<text>The Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel is a large resort hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The hotel is located on the site of ʻĀinahau, the royal estate of Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. The estate was demolished in 1925 by the owners of the Moana Hotel, located across Kalakaua Avenue, for the construction of wood frame bungalows for the hotel.

The bungalows were demolished in 1953 and the Matson Line constructed the Princess Kaiulani Hotel on the site, which opened on June 11, 1955. The 11-story building was the tallest in Hawaii at the time.

In 1959, Matson sold their hotels to Sheraton Hotels. Sheraton added a second wing to the successful Princess Kaiulani Hotel in 1960, the 210-room Diamond Head Wing. The hotel was sold to Kyo-Ya Company Limited in July 1963, though Sheraton continued to operate it. Kyo-Ya added a third wing, the 29-story Ainahau Tower, in 1970. Later in the 1970s, they renamed the hotel the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani.

On November 12, 2024, workers at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel ratified a new labor contract.

<doc id="699453" wikidata="Q7353365" url="?curid=699453" title="Robot Odyssey">
<text>Robot Odyssey is a digital logic game developed by Mike Wallace and Dr. Leslie Grimm and published by The Learning Company in December 1984. It is a sequel to &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot;, and was released for the Apple II, TRS-80 Color Computer, and MS-DOS. Most players have found it challenging. The player is readying for bed when, suddenly, they fall through the floor into an underground city of robots, &quot;Robotropolis&quot;. The player begins in the sewers of the city with three programmable robots, and must make their way to the top of the city to try to find their way home again.

==Gameplay==
The aim of &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot; is to program and control robots (Sparky, Checkers, and Scanner with a fourth added in later levels) in order to escape &quot;Robotropolis&quot;, a labyrinthine underground city filled with hundreds of rooms of puzzles that need to be solved to progress any further. The city consists of five levels of increasing difficulty, requiring the design of more and more sophisticated circuits.

A tutorial and robot testing laboratory (the &quot;Innovation Lab&quot;) are also provided with the game.
Except for their color and initial programming, the three robots are identical inside. They are equipped with four thrusters and bumper sensors, a grabber, a radio antenna (for basic communication with other robots), a battery, and a periscope to use while riding inside a robot.

Throughout the game, the player is presented with various challenges which require programming the three robots to accomplish various tasks. This is done by wiring a synchronous digital circuit, consisting of logic gates and flip-flops, inside of the robots. Tasks and puzzles range from navigating a simple maze and retrieving items to complex tasks requiring interaction and communication between two or more robots. Though the player can ride inside the robots, most challenges involve the robots acting autonomously and cannot be completed with the player inside (and perhaps simply rewiring their robot on the fly).

The robots can also be wired up to chips, which provide a convenient and reproducible way to program the robots. Various pre-programmed chips are scattered throughout the city and range from complex circuits such as a wall-hugging chip which can be used to navigate through mazes and corridors (one of which is wired to a robot at the beginning) to clocks and counters. The player must find out how these chips work themselves, as the only information about each chip is a short, and sometimes cryptic, description. Additionally, there are predesigned chip files stored on the various disks containing the game that can be loaded into the in-game chips. The available chips stored in this fashion vary depending on the port or version used.

The &quot;Innovation Lab&quot; can be used to test out circuit designs in the robots or create new chips. Chips created in the lab can then be loaded into and used in the main game. Loading a chip in the main game will erase the previous programming stored in the chip.

Although the game is recommended for ages 10 and up, it can prove to be quite challenging even for adults. In terms of educational value, the game teaches the basic concepts of electrical engineering and digital logic in general.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reviewed &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot; and &quot;ChipWits&quot;, preferring the former to the latter but stating that both were &quot;incredibly vivid simulation experiences&quot;.

==Legacy==
The engine for the game was written by Warren Robinett, and variants of it were used in many of The Learning Company&#x27;s graphical adventure games of the time, including &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot;, &quot;Gertrude&#x27;s Secrets&quot;, &quot;Gertrude&#x27;s Puzzles&quot;, and &quot;Think Quick!&quot;, all of which are similar but easier logic puzzle games. The gameplay and visual design were derived from Robinett&#x27;s influential Atari 2600 video game, &quot;Adventure&quot;.

&quot;ChipWits&quot; by Doug Sharp and Mike Johnston, a 1984 game for Macintosh later ported to the Apple II, and Commodore 64 computers, is similar in theme but the player&#x27;s robot behaviour is programmed with actions blocks instead of using logic flops, switches, etc.

Epsitec Games created &quot;Colobot&quot; and &quot;Ceebot&quot; for Windows. The player programs machines through object-oriented programming like Java, C++, or C# to accomplish puzzle tasks. The objective of these games was to teach the player the fundamentals of these languages.

&quot;Carnage Heart&quot; involves programming mechas that then fight without any user input.

Cognitoy&#x27;s &quot;MindRover&quot; is also similar in spirit to &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot;, but uses different programming concepts in its gameplay.

===Clones===
One Girl One Laptop productions created a free to download spiritual successor, for Windows and MacOS, called &quot;GATE&quot; which uses the same digital logic puzzles as &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot;.

There is also a clone that can be run in any system with a Java runtime, &quot;DroidQuest&quot;, which contains all the original levels and an additional secret level.

<text>Darlene Kay Olson Hooley (born April 4, 1939) is an American politician and former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Oregon who represented the state&#x27;s .

A high school teacher by profession, she served as a city councilwoman, state legislator, and county commissioner in Oregon before being elected to the House in 1996. In her post-congressional career, she remains engaged in civic life in Oregon and works as a strategic planning consultant.

==Early life==
Darlene Kay Olson was born in Williston, North Dakota to Clarence Alvin and Alyce Rogers Olson, who were wheat farmers. She moved with her parents to Salem, Oregon at the age of 8. She attended Salem Academy, and then Pasadena Nazarene College (now Point Loma Nazarene University) in southern California, where she also worked as a lifeguard. She returned to Oregon and earned her degree in education from Oregon State University in 1961, where she was on the basketball, field hockey, and rowing teams. Following her graduation, she taught reading, music, and high school physical education for eight years at schools in Woodburn, Gervais, and Portland. She also did post-graduate work at Oregon State and Portland State University.

==Early political career==
Hooley became interested in politics after her son was injured on a playground in West Linn. She was appointed to a parks advisory committee, and in 1976, became the first woman elected to serve on the West Linn City Council. In 1980, Hooley was elected to the Oregon State Legislature and served as a State Representative until 1987. In the legislature she served in the lower chamber (Oregon House of Representatives) as a Democrat representing Clackamas County (District 27), succeeding Republican Ted Achilles. She chaired the environmental and energy committees, helping to pass energy conservation and recycling legislation and worked on rewriting land use planning laws. In her third term, she chaired the education subcommittee of the ways and means committee. As subcommittee chair, she is credited with leading reforms to Oregon&#x27;s public kindergarten, pay equity laws, and welfare system. Hooley left the legislature in 1987 to accept a position on the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners.

== U.S. House ==

=== Elections ===
In 1996, Hooley ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against one-term incumbent Republican Jim Bunn, who had been voted in as part of the Republican Revolution of 1994. Hooley won 51% of the vote in a field that included Bunn and two minor party candidates. Ironically, while Bunn&#x27;s loss was attributed in part to his divorce and remarriage during his only term, Hooley also divorced during her first term in 1997.

In the 2006 election, Hooley won a sixth term, defeating Republican Mike Erickson (who spent over $1 million of his own money), Green Paul Aranas, and Constitution candidate Douglas Patterson. She filed to run for a seventh term in 2008,
but in February 2008 announced she would not seek an additional term, creating an unexpected open seat in the 2008 election.

=== Tenure ===
In her first term in the U.S. House, Hooley was elected House Democratic freshman class president. Local political observers reported that she solidified support in her closely divided district, by staking out moderate positions, avoiding controversy and scandal. In later terms, she was appointed to leadership positions in the House Democratic Caucus.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks Hooley, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, advocated adapting banking laws and acting to disrupt the financial foundations of terrorist networks. She has also focused on issues surrounding identity theft prevention and increasing medical and financial privacy. In 2003, she was a key sponsor of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (HR 2622), which gave Americans the ability to receive free annual credit reports.

She also focused on methamphetamines and ecoterrorism legislation, and supported the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.

In 2002, Hooley voted against the authorization of the use of
military force in Iraq. As a member of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs committee, she focused on issues of veterans&#x27; health care and deployment of National Guard troops to the Iraq War.

Hooley was a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, she cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. She was also successful in directing federal funding to her district, including millions of dollars for transportation, timber, and agricultural interests.

=== Committees ===
She served on the Science and Technology, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees. She was a House Senior Whip for the Democratic Party and a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

==Electoral history==
==Post-congressional career==
After leaving Congress, Hooley joined former Multnomah County Commissioner Lisa Naito in founding Hooley &amp; Naito, a strategic planning and legislative advocacy firm.

Hooley remains active in supporting veterans and established the Darlene Hooley Scholarship for Oregon Veterans, under the auspices of the Oregon Community Foundation.

In 2012, the City of Portland dedicated the Darlene Hooley Pedestrian Bridge, a bridge that connects the Lair Hill neighborhood to the South Waterfront district.

Hooley is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

<text>Alvin Victor &quot;Honest Vic&quot; Donahey (July 7, 1873April 8, 1946) was an American Democratic Party politician from Ohio. Donahey was the 50th governor of Ohio and a United States Senator from Ohio.

Donahey left school early to become a printer; in addition to working as a newspaper editor, he owned his own printing company. After serving in local and county government as a school board member and county auditor in the early 1900s, in 1912 he won election as Ohio&#x27;s state auditor, and he served until 1921. After an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1920, in 1922 Donahey won the governorship. He was reelected in 1924 and 1926, and served from 1923 to 1929. In 1934, Donahey won election to the U.S. Senate, and he served one term, 1935 to 1941.

After leaving office, Donahey resumed his business interests, including serving as president of the Donahey Clay Products Company, which made tiles for use in home construction. He died in Columbus in 1946, and was buried at East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia.

==Early life==
Donahey was born in Cadwallader, Ohio, the son of John C. Donahey and Catherine (Chaney) Donahey. He attended the public schools of Tuscarawas County, and left high school in his junior year to receive training as a printer; he worked at the &quot;New Philadelphia Times&quot; from 1893 to 1905, and advanced from journeyman to foreman to associate editor before becoming owner of his own printing company.

==Career==
Donahey was elected clerk of the Goshen Township Board of Trustees in 1898, and served until 1903. He served as Tuscarawas County Auditor from 1905 to 1909 while at the same time serving on New Philadelphia, Ohio&#x27;s Board of Education. After serving as a delegate to the 1912 Constitutional Convention, Donahey served as state auditor from 1912 to 1921. He did not seek re-election in 1920, but unsuccessfully sought the governorship.

==Governor==
In 1922, Donahey won the governor&#x27;s race. He served three terms, 1923 to 1929, and was not a candidate for re-election in 1928. Donahey earned the nickname &quot;Veto Vic&quot; while governor because he vetoed seventy-six bills during his first term in office. Of particular concern to Donahey were bills for increasing state revenue; he vetoed every bill that would have raised taxes. Donahey also vetoed a Ku Klux Klan-backed bill that would have mandated daily Bible reading in public schools. In addition, he vetoed a bill promoted by the Anti-Saloon League that would have required individuals convicted of crimes, primarily those convicted of possessing or consuming alcohol, to perform manual labor if they had been assessed fines which had gone unpaid. Instead, Donahey pardoned more than two thousand convicts who were serving time in jails and workhouses, arguing that enforcement of the Prohibition amendment disproportionately affected the poor.

From 1926 to 1928 Donahey was mentioned as a possible candidate for president or vice president in the 1928 election. He received five delegate votes for the presidential nomination which went to Alfred E. Smith, but was not a candidate for the vice presidential nomination, which went to Joseph T. Robinson.

After leaving the governorship, Donahey returned to his business interests. In 1928, Donahey and six partners founded the Motorists’ Mutual Insurance Company of Columbus, of which Donahey became president.

==United States Senator==
He won election to the United States Senate in 1934, unseating Republican Simeon Fess by a wide margin (1,276,208 to 839,068) and served one term in the Senate from 1935 until 1941. In 1940 Democrats in Ohio asked him to consider running for president as a favorite son in an effort to aid Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s bid for a third term, but he declined. (The plan would have had Ohio&#x27;s delegates to the Democratic National Convention pledged to Donahey until Roosevelt became a candidate, at which point Donahey would release the delegates to Roosevelt.)

Donahey was president of the Donahey Clay Products Company. He was also a director of the Ohio National Bank of Columbus, Ohio.

==Death and burial==
Donahey died at Grant Hospital in Columbus on April 8, 1946. He is buried in East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia, Ohio.

==Family life==
Donahey was married to Mary (Harvey) Donahey (1879–1953). His son, John W. Donahey, served a term as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. His daughter-in-law, Gertrude Walton Donahey served as Ohio State Treasurer. His brother William Donahey was a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist and creator of the Teenie Weenies comic strip. Another brother, James Harrison &quot;Hal&quot; Donahey, was the cartoonist for the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; and designed the household tiles made by the Donahey Clay Products Company.

==Legacy==
The Donahey Agriculture &amp; Horticulture Building at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus are named in honor of Donahey. Constructed in 1926, it was named for Donahey in 1977 after a previous building named for him, a horse barn, burned down in 1972.

<doc id="699462" wikidata="Q5183698" url="?curid=699462" title="Credibility gap">
<text>Credibility gap is a term that came into wide use with journalism, political and public discourse in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. At the time, it was most frequently used to describe public skepticism about the Lyndon B. Johnson administration&#x27;s statements and policies on the Vietnam War. It was used in journalism as a euphemism for recognized lies told to the public by politicians. Today, it is used more generally to describe almost any &quot;gap&quot; between an actual situation and what politicians and government agencies say about it.

==History==
The term &quot;credibility gap&quot; came against a background of the use of the term &quot;missile gap&quot;, which the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists as first being used by then-Senator John F. Kennedy on 14 August 1958, when he stated: &quot;Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap.&quot; &quot;Doomsday gap&quot; and &quot;mineshaft gap&quot; were the imagined post-apocalyptic continuations of this paranoia in the 1964 Cold War satire &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

The term &quot;credibility gap&quot; was widely in use as early as 1963, according to &quot;Timetables of History&quot;. Prior to its association with the Vietnam War, in December 1962, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Inter-American Council, Republican US Senator for New York Kenneth B. Keating praised President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s prompt action in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but he said there was an urgent need for the United States to plug the &quot;credibility gap&quot; in U.S. policy on Cuba. It was popularized in 1966 by J. William Fulbright, a Democratic Senator from Arkansas, when he could not get a straight answer from President Johnson&#x27;s Administration regarding the war in Vietnam.

&quot;Credibility gap&quot; was first used in association with the Vietnam War in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in March 1965, to describe then-president Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s handling of the escalation of American involvement in the war. A number of events—particularly the surprise Tet Offensive, and later the 1971 release of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;—helped to confirm public suspicion that there was a significant &quot;gap&quot; between the administration&#x27;s declarations of controlled military and political resolution, and the reality. These were viewed as examples of Johnson&#x27;s and later Richard Nixon&#x27;s duplicity. Throughout the war, Johnson worked with his officials to ensure that his public addresses would only disclose bare details of the war to the American public. During the war the country grew more and more aware of the credibility gap especially after Johnson&#x27;s speech at Johns Hopkins University in April 1965. An example of public opinion appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; concerning the war. &quot;The time has come to call a spade a bloody shovel. This country is in an undeclared and unexplained war in Vietnam. Our masters have a lot of long and fancy names for it, like escalation and retaliation, but it is a war just the same.&quot;

The advent of the presence of television journalists allowed by the military to report and photograph events of the war within hours or days of their actual occurrence in an uncensored manner drove the discrepancy widely referred to as &quot;the credibility gap&quot;.

==Later usage==
After the Vietnam War, the term &quot;credibility gap&quot; came to be used by political opponents in cases where an actual, perceived or implied discrepancy existed between a politician&#x27;s public pronouncements and the actual, perceived or implied reality. For example, in the 1970s the term was applied to Nixon&#x27;s own handling of the Vietnam War and subsequently to the discrepancy between evidence of Richard Nixon&#x27;s complicity in the Watergate break-in and his repeated claims of innocence.

Since 2017, the term has been used to describe the Trump administration, particularly in relation to the use of what White House Counsel Kellyanne Conway called alternative facts.

<text>Habbo, also called Habbo Hotel, is a virtual world and massively multiplayer online game. It is owned and operated by Sulake. Founded in 2000, &quot;Habbo&quot; has expanded to nine online communities (or &quot;hotels&quot;), with users from more than 150 countries. , 316 million avatars have been registered in the game.

The website is divided into three clients, &quot;Habbo&quot;, &quot;Habbo X&quot;, and &quot;Habbo Hotel: Origins&quot;. The &quot;Habbo&quot; client is aimed at teenagers and young adults, while &quot;Habbo X&quot; and &quot;Habbo Hotel: Origins&quot; cater for adult players.

Users on the game can create a virtual avatar (called a &quot;Habbo&quot;), converse and interact with other users, play games, build and design virtual rooms, take care of virtual pets, and complete quests.

==History==

&quot;Habbo&quot; stemmed from a 1999 hobby project by creative designer Sampo Karjalainen and technologist Aapo Kyrölä entitled Mobiles Disco, for a Finnish band. It was a virtual chat room running on Kyrölä&#x27;s Fuse technology. After having been contracted to design a virtual game and chat called (Snow Wars) for a Finnish internet service provider, they were contracted for another project. They developed (Hotel Goldfish) with a small team of developers. It launched in August 2000 on the ISP&#x27;s web portal.

Kyrölä, Karjalainen and Dee Edwards, an entrepreneur from the UK, wanted to create an international business based on the virtual hotel concept, drafting a plan in autumn 2000, and raised finance. By the end of January 2001, &quot;Habbo Hotel&quot; had been launched in beta mode. The new hotel exited beta a few weeks afterwards, aimed at the teenage market, with marketing and payment partners in place, run from a HQ in London. It featured a new credits system with community and safety features. The next community (&quot;hotel&quot;) was launched in Switzerland a few months later, in four languages. It has since been expanded to over 31 countries in five continents, with being rebranded as a local &quot;Habbo&quot; hotel, and has been invested in by venture capitalists.

In May 2006, the service&#x27;s domain names were changed from codice_1 (.co.uk, .com.au, etc.) to codice_2 (.co.uk, .com.au, etc.).

In August 2007, &quot;Habbo&quot;&#x27;s Chinese hotel closed down temporarily. The challenging Chinese market and high operational costs led to the decision of closing the service. Customers in China were redirected to other Habbo communities.
In December 2008, the Russian hotel announced it was closing in February 2009 as a result of low numbers. Those on the site with &quot;furni&quot; (virtual furniture that can be used to furnish rooms in the hotel, bought with the use of Habbo credits that can be purchased with real money) received credit codes for use on the U.S. hotel.

In January 2010, it was announced that the U.S. and Canadian hotels would undergo a merger, to be finalized in April 2010. However, in April 2010, it was announced that all English-speaking hotels would be merged into one. On 5 May, the merger for Habbo U.S .and Habbo Canada was complete. On 2 June the Australian hotel merge was completed. The Singaporean hotel was officially merged on 4 June. On 10 June, the final hotel, Habbo UK, was merged and that completed the set, making Habbo.com the international, English-speaking game. Accounts were migrated to the final English-speaking hotel with varying degrees of automation until March 2011 – after that date any accounts not migrated from the initial Habbo Canada, Singapore, UK and Australia hotels were deleted.

On 12 June 2012, concerns about the game were raised by &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. A two-month investigation found users posting pornographic and violent messages – despite the fact that &quot;Habbo&quot; is intended for children and young adults. A reporter posing as an 11-year-old girl claimed that explicit sex chats were common within minutes of logging on to the game, which she described as &quot;very sexual, perverse, violent, pornographic.&quot; As a result of the allegations, Sulake immediately suspended all chat on the game. Speaking in a blog post, chief executive of Sulake, Paul LaFontaine, said that the firm &quot;was reviewing the long-term plans for the Habbo community&quot;. The chat services were reinstated in June 2012. Two leading investors, Balderton Capital and 3i, withdrew their funding from Sulake, and some UK retailers stopped selling Habbo gift cards.

In August 2012, Sulake announced a new hotel, &quot;Habbo&quot; Turkey, fully localised for Turkish-speakers. The then CEO of Sulake, Paul LaFontaine commented, &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to announce we have launched in Turkey. This is a very important market for us and we expect Habbo Hotel to be a big success there, with many teenagers joining to converse with friends, meet people with similar interests and enjoy access to the global Habbo Hotel network. Our launch in Turkey is the next big step on our global roadmap.&quot;

In May 2014, Sulake released a &quot;Habbo&quot; application for the iPad in the App Store worldwide.

In December 2020, Sulake released their new beta-version of &quot;Habbo&quot;. The game has moved to the Unity platform, since Adobe Flash marks its end in 2020. In February 2021, Sulake released the Adobe AIR client alongside the Unity client, with the plan to continue work on the Unity client and improve the user experience. In the official statement from the product owner, he acknowledged that the Unity client was lacking key features and did not reflect the needs of the community. The AIR client is a temporary solution to many of the concerns the community had initially about the Unity client and will eventually be retired when the new client is at an acceptable level and contains key features that the Habbo community rely on.

In 2021, Azerion reached an agreement with fellow Sulake shareholder Elisa Oyj to acquire the company fully. Azerion had a majority stake in Sulake until it secured a deal with Oyj for the remaining 49 per cent of shares. Azerion, which is a pan-European firm specialising in gaming and adtech, first purchased a controlling stake of 51% in Sulake back in 2018. It has since been helping to grow revenues, which have risen 46% between January 2019 and December 2020. &quot;Habbo&quot; joined a block within Azerion’s gaming content business which consists of other leading acclaimed products, including Woozworld and Governor of Poker.

In April 2021, &quot;Habbo&quot; brought back the mini game SnowStorm.

In September 2021, an NFT collection was introduced. The collection consists of Habbo avatars that can also be used in the community. In addition, a new NFT Habbo Hotel server named &quot;Habbo X&quot; entered Alpha access in December 2022. This new Hotel only allows access to those who own NFTs from certain collections.

In December 2022, Sulake released Habbo X. Currently in an alpha test phase, Habbo X is a game that focuses on community building, interoperability, and play-and-earn mechanics.

In June 2024, Sulake released Habbo Hotel: Origins, which is a version of the 2005 Habbo client software with a more community lead approach. Targeted at adults only.

==Gameplay==
Habbo&#x27;s main feature is the &quot;hotel&quot;, and consists of a client made using the Unity platform. The hotel can be accessed by logged-in users via the Habbo Homepage. When a user accesses the Hotel they are brought to a screen colloquially known as &quot;Hotel View/Landing View&quot;. From this screen, members can navigate to virtual rooms via the &quot;Navigator&quot; and browse the rooms of the hotel, look for items to buy in the catalogue, private message friends on their friends list or enter their preset &quot;Home room&quot;.

===Public rooms &amp; games===
Public Rooms are rooms which are available to all members. They often depict scenes such as restaurants, cinemas, and dance clubs. Most Public Rooms contain automated bots (non-player characters) that shout pre-recorded messages and tips, and can give avatars drinks and food items. Public Rooms are designed by Sulake and are not customizable by users. Rooms in the Habbo Hotel: Origins client contain games such as Wobble Squabble, Lido Diving, Battle Ball and the Cunning Fox Gamehall with games such as Noughts and Crosses, Battleships, Chess and Poker.

In June 2011, most Public Rooms were removed from the Habbo client. Games such as Battle Ball, and Snow Storm were replaced with Freeze and Battle Banzai due to coding issues when they upgraded from Shockwave to Flash.
In June 2024, in the Habbo Hotel: Origins client, users can access classic games with the purchase of in game tickets such as Wobble Squabble, Lido Diving and Battle Ball. Players also have access to free games in the Cunning Fox Gamehall with games such as Noughts and Crosses, Battleships, Chess and Poker.

===Guest rooms===
Guest Rooms are special rooms which users can customize with furniture, wallpaper, and floor patterns; these can be purchased with credits. Users can choose from pre-made room blueprints or create their own with builders club. Guest rooms can be created by any member and can be locked to allow access only to specific users or password holder. Many users create their own games in their guest rooms, which give furniture or coins as a prize. These rooms are categorized on the navigator in many categories such as &quot;Trading&quot;, &quot;Parties&quot;, and &quot;Role Playing&quot;. Virtual pets and bots can be bought and kept in Guest rooms. Users can interact with the pets and program bots, which will obey certain commands the player throws at them.

===User created games===
Users can create and host their own games in Habbo by buying and using furniture from the shop. Games such as Falling Furni, Cozzie Change, The Fridge Game, Mazes or by &quot;buying game bundles&quot; in the shop such as Battle Banzai, Freeze, Football and Ice Tag. Users can check out the hotel&#x27;s Navigator and select the Games &amp; Mazes category under the Rooms tab to play in other people&#x27;s user-created rooms hosting games. 

===Role-play elements===
Habbo users often create guest rooms which emulate real world businesses, police departments and other establishments. As the game&#x27;s platform facilitates the creation of groups some users choose to design their groups based on a role-playing theme and go on to participate in activities which promote their groups to other users in the game.

==Currency==
There are three main types of currency on Habbo. Credits (or coins) are used to buy furniture in the catalogue, and Duckets (free currency earned by completing achievements such as logging in a number of days in a row) enable users to buy effects and &#x27;Rentable furni&#x27; (furniture to decorate rooms for a period of time, before it is then removed). Diamonds are used to buy rewards such as exclusive furniture items or Habbo Club and are gained by buying credits (one diamond for each credit bought). As well as that, seasonally themed currencies (e.g. &quot;Snowflakes&quot; for Christmas) are given out to players by staff for completing certain quests which can then be used to buy seasonal Furni for a short time.

In addition to these three, NFT credits (and credit furni) have been added shortly after the release of the NFT avatar collection.

===Credits===
Credits (also called &quot;coins&quot; in some hotels) are an in-game virtual currency that can be purchased using a variety of different services, such as credit card, a telephone service, a prepaid card and via SMS. They can also be redeemed into &quot;Exchange&quot;, which displays the Credits as an item of virtual furniture; the furniture can then be traded among users, and redeemed back into Credits. Users can join Habbo Club (HC), which is a premium subscription purchased using Credits. Features of Habbo Club membership include a badge, new clothes and outfits for a player&#x27;s avatar, more friends on their friends list, the ability to create groups, and a free piece of furni exclusive to club members every month.

====Duckets====
Duckets (a play on the word ducats) are part of a new and complementary currency introduced in February 2013. Users earn Duckets by completing certain achievements and quests.

The Duckets currency can be used to purchase effects, room promotions, furniture and even as far as pets.

====Diamonds====
Diamonds are another currency on Habbo. It was introduced in early July 2014. Diamonds are received through purchases of Credits with real money. Diamonds are used to buy Habbo Club, buy rare furniture items or they can be redeemed for credits in furniture form.

===NFT credits===
At the start of 2022 a new currency was added which is generated daily for NFT avatar holders (depending on the count and type of avatars held).

This currency can be used to buy exclusive furniture and clothes in a dedicated shop on the Habbo NFT website. Credits can also be exchanged for Credit Furni (NFT bank note items) which, together with the other NFT items, may be traded on Immutable X Marketplace for several common Cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, owning a NFT avatar grants Habbo Club and Builders Club access (which both normally cost a monthly fee).

==Moderation==
Habbo&#x27;s parent company Sulake has automated online moderation, and only house Community Coordinators are available for all hotels. Habbo stated in 2011 that the in-game moderators were tasked with tracking some 70 million lines of conversation worldwide every day, and blocking inappropriate users and filtering links to black-listed sites.

Sulake also worked with child safety organizations and local police forces to stop inappropriate behavior. Habbo&#x27;s moderation and safety systems were recognized as making the service as one of the safest social networks in a 2011 European Commission report. In 2011, Habbo was also awarded the commendation of &#x27;Safer by Design&#x27; from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). Sulake encouraged users to take responsibility for reporting any abuses or any bad behaviour on the site, providing education and rapid-response support to users who may experience uncomfortable conversations or questions.

As well as working within the Habbo online community, Sulake actively contributed to campaigns like Insafe and Safer Internet Day to be used on relevant user safety issues and collaborates in more than 30 charitable partnerships around the world to educate teens about a load of topics including safe internet use, trolling, the dangers of drugs, bullying etc. Partners include NSPCC (ChildLine), UNICEF, the Red Cross, the National Safety Hospital, Frank, Child Right, Power Child as well as many other market specific organisations.

Users in Habbo can report users breaking the Habbo Way (there are sets of rules on Habbo that everyone must obey) by clicking on the offending avatar, scrolling through their information and clicking report then trying to highlight the offending pieces of chat. Users can also ignore their user by clicking on them and pressing ignore, and this will block every action and chat line that comes from that user into their view.

Automatic moderation exists in Habbo&#x27;s language filter, the &quot;Bobba Filter&quot;, which replaces offensive text with the simple word &quot;bobba&quot;. Replacement applies to anything from mild to highly offensive words, groups of 6 or more numbers, suggestive phrases, and websites.

From August 2000 to 31 December 2005, Habbo existed as a program for experienced members of each Habbo community to become a &#x27;Hobba&#x27;. Hobbas were non-paid, volunteer moderators with limited powers that acted as Hotel Guides. On 31 December 2005, Sulake suspended the Hobba program completely due to major security issues and the rapidly growing Habbo community. It was decided that it needed a stronger, more professional moderation team, that would be followed by employees of Sulake. The following requests for the program to be revived, in June 2012, it was announced that modernized Hobbas, called Guardians, would be introduced into Habbo. These users will be limited and will be closely monitored to ensure safety is not compromised or advanced.

In June 2012, there was a two-month investigation by Channel 4 News that uncovered lapses in Habbo&#x27;s online moderation, such as cyber sex, sexual frequences and sexual predation on minors, which subsequently led to withdrawals from two of the company&#x27;s biggest investors. In response to the news, the company globally muted all chat and text, and launched &quot;The Great Unmute&quot;, which allowed users to express their views on the company&#x27;s future, their experiences with Habbo, and their thoughts on the Channel Four News report. Following this, launching &quot;The Great Go-Live&quot;, Habbo lifted the chat restrictions for Finnish users to allow testing on a new safety system. Chat restrictions were lifted for users in Brazil and Spain, followed by France, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. A &quot;Parental Advisory Summit&quot; was also launched, to allow parents and users the chance to answer how Habbo can deliver a safer experience, have a safe environment and influence what content children view on other social media platforms. Restrictions on chat were lifted in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and finally in the English hotel on 6 July 2012.

==Habbo raids==
Habbo has been a frequent target for organized raids by Anonymous. In 2006, a meme began circulating on 4chan boards regarding racist conduct by Habbo moderators and arbitrary banning of players with darker-skinned avatars. As a result, users signed up to the Habbo site dressed in avatars of a black man wearing a grey suit and an Afro hairstyle (usually known as the &quot;nigra&quot;; see &quot;Patriotic Nigras&quot;) and blocked entry to the pool, declaring that it was &quot;closed due to AIDS&quot;, flooding the site with internet sayings, and forming swastika-like formations. When the raiders were banned, they complained of racism.

In January 2021, the live-streamer Quackity and his viewers raided the game with the hashtag &quot;#NOTMYHABBO&quot;, protesting the recent restrictions on item trading.

==Sponsorship==
As a website geared towards teenagers, Habbo has attracted sponsorship from outside entities and organizations. This sponsorship includes visits by musicians (such as Gorillaz, Skye Sweetnam, Jamelia, and Akon) as well as various corporations. In 2014, Habbo associated itself with the company DitchTheLabel which hosts various anti-bullying sessions on Habbo.

==Reception==
In November 2001, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed Habbo as a top-10 chat and instant messaging site, describing it as &quot;great-looking&quot; and &quot;proving popular with teenagers.&quot; In 2005 and 2006, Habbo Australia received the NetGuide Online Web Award for &quot;Best kids&#x27;/youth website&quot;. In September 2006, Sulake won Deloitte&#x27;s Fast 50 competition.

Common Sense Media, a non-profit association advocating for children and families, and studying the effects that media and technology have on young users, reports that &quot;foul talk and sexy chat rooms dominate [this] virtual world&quot;, giving it one star out of five and not recommending it for kids of any age.

In 2009, Habbo won the Most Innovative Launch Campaign 2009 in The Media Guardian Innovation Awards.

==Websites==

There are currently 10 websites in operation, with as many as 12 up until 29 April 2015. This date saw the closure of the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish language hotels, having been in operation from December 2004, June 2004 and December 2003 respectively.

<doc id="699474" wikidata="Q1758507" url="?curid=699474" title="Peter DeFazio">
<text>Peter Anthony DeFazio ( ; born May 27, 1947) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1987 to 2023. He is a member of the Democratic Party and is a founder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. A native of Massachusetts and a veteran of the United States Air Force Reserve, he previously served as a county commissioner in Lane County, Oregon. On December 1, 2021, DeFazio announced he would not seek reelection in 2022.

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
DeFazio was born in 1947 in Needham, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, graduating from Needham High School in 1965. He credits his great-uncle with shaping his politics; that great-uncle almost never said &quot;Republican&quot; without adding &quot;bastard&quot; (or &quot;bastud&quot;, as it sounded in a Boston accent). He served in the United States Air Force Reserve from 1967 to 1971. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tufts University in 1969 and a Master of Arts degree in gerontology from the University of Oregon in 1977.

From 1977 to 1982, DeFazio worked as an aide to U.S. Representative Jim Weaver. He was elected as a Lane County Commissioner in 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 to 1986.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In 1986, DeFazio ran for the U.S. House from Oregon&#x27;s 4th congressional district, upon the retirement of incumbent Democratic congressman Jim Weaver. DeFazio narrowly won a competitive three-way primary against State Senators Bill Bradbury and Margie Hendriksen, 34%–33%-31%. He won the general election with 54% of the vote.

DeFazio did not face another contest nearly that close until 2010, winning every election before then with at least 61% of the vote. He forged a nearly unbreakable hold on a district that was only marginally Democratic on paper. This is due almost entirely to the presence of his base in Lane County, which had almost half the district&#x27;s population. The district narrowly voted for George W. Bush in 2000 (due mainly to Ralph Nader being on the ballot), John Kerry in 2004, and Hillary Clinton by 0.1 percentage point in 2016. In 2020, DeFazio defeated Alek Skarlatos by over 25,000 votes (5.4%). Pacific Green Party candidate Daniel Hoffay finished third with 2.2% of the vote.

==== 2008 ====

DeFazio won 82% of the vote over two minor-party candidates.

Earlier, he reportedly considered and reconsidered running against Gordon H. Smith in the 2008 Senate election. On April 20, 2007, DeFazio announced he would not run for Smith&#x27;s seat.

After Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, it was reported that DeFazio was under consideration for Secretary of Transportation. U.S. Representative Ray LaHood was named to the post in December 2008.

==== 2010 ====

In 2010, DeFazio was challenged by Republican Art Robinson and Pacific Green candidate Michael Beilstein. As permitted by &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, a Super PAC group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $300,000 for ads attacking DeFazio. It was not revealed until the mid-October 2010 quarterly FEC filings that the group was solely funded by Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in Owings Mills, Maryland, and New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of Setauket, New York. According to Dan Eggen at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the group said &quot;it was formed in September &#x27;to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation&#x27; in the fight against &#x27;runaway spending.&#x27;&quot; The only expenditures were for the ads attacking DeFazio and Democratic Representative Frank Kratovil of Maryland.

DeFazio won with 54.5% of the vote, his lowest winning percentage since he was first elected in 1986. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; said that DeFazio&#x27;s reelection to his 13th term was notable more for the amount of outside money spent on the campaign than for the candidates themselves.

==== 2012 ====

In September 2011, the &quot;National Journal&quot; cited DeFazio as an example of &quot;swing-district Democrats seeking reelection in 2012&quot;, and who, in &quot;begin[ning] to focus on their reelection bids after Labor Day...are increasingly calculating how close is too close to an unpopular President Obama.&quot; It also noted that DeFazio&#x27;s district &quot;nearly went for Republican George W. Bush in 2004.&quot;

Redistricting made the 4th slightly friendlier for DeFazio. He picked up almost all of Benton County, including all of Corvallis, home to Oregon State University.

==== 2020 ====

DeFazio faced a challenge in 2020 from Alek Skarlatos, a Roseburg High School graduate, a former Oregon National Guard soldier who helped subdue a terrorist in the 2015 Thalys train attack. DeFazio won the election by 5.3 points, his narrowest victory since taking office.

===Tenure===

DeFazio has a progressive voting record. In 1992, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus with Bernie Sanders, Ron Dellums, Lane Evans, Thomas Andrews, and Maxine Waters, and was its chair from 2003 to 2005.
During the 1999 World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, DeFazio marched with protesters who opposed the WTO&#x27;s new economic globalization policies.

====Political positions====

===== Infrastructure =====
DeFazio spent his entire career on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, becoming its chairman when Democrats won the House in 2018. During his time on the committee, he has served as chair or ranking member of four of the six subcommittees: Aviation, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Highways and Transit, and Water Resources and Environment.

In 2020, DeFazio sponsored H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. This bill invested $1.5 trillion in highways, rail, transit, airports, ports and harbors, wastewater and drinking water infrastructure, brownfields, broadband, and more.

DeFazio felt shunted aside when Senate negotiators secured a deal on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which became law largely without input from the House. He blasted the legislation in closed-door meetings, earning the moniker the &quot;Tiger of the House&quot;.

DeFazio eventually supported and helped pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and joined President Biden a number of times to promote it.

===== Investigation into Boeing and 737 MAX crashes =====
As chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, DeFazio led an investigation into the causes of the crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX planes, which resulted in 346 deaths. DeFazio&#x27;s 18-month investigation laid out serious flaws and missteps in the design, development, and certification of the aircraft. The committee&#x27;s Majority Staff prepared a 238-page report outlining the repeated and serious failures made by Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.

DeFazio helped pass comprehensive aircraft certification reform and safety legislation in the wake of his committee&#x27;s report as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which President Donald Trump signed into law on December 27, 2020.

In 2022, Netflix premiered &quot;&quot;, a documentary film by Rory Kennedy that details DeFazio&#x27;s investigation.

=====Immigration=====
In October 2011, DeFazio demanded that the U.S. Department of Labor strengthen restrictions on the hiring of foreign guest workers for forestry jobs intended for unemployed U.S. citizens.

DeFazio issued a statement condemning President Donald Trump&#x27;s January 2017 executive order suspending all refugee admissions to the U.S. for 120 days and barring entry for 90 days to immigrants from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

In January 2018, DeFazio&#x27;s guest for the State of the Union Address was Jesus Narvaez, a &quot;Dreamer&quot;, DACA activist, and member of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MEChA).

In June 2018, DeFazio and other members of Congress from Oregon demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) permit individuals held at a federal prison in Sheridan, Oregon, under the Trump administration&#x27;s &quot;zero-tolerance policy&quot; to make free telephone calls to arrange legal representation.

=====Abortion=====
DeFazio supports legal abortion.

=====Military=====
DeFazio has voted against legislation that would increase U.S. military power. In 2000, he voted against legislation to create a national missile defense network, calling the system a &quot;comic book fantasy&quot;. He has consistently voted against the Patriot Act, including its inception after 9/11 and the recurring reauthorization bills, arguing that it infringes on Americans&#x27; civil rights. He also voted against the USA Freedom Act, which reauthorized certain provisions of the Patriot Act in modified form. He voted multiple times to set an itinerary for bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq.

===== Postal Service =====
In 2013, DeFazio introduced the Postal Service Protection Act, a bipartisan proposal to comprehensively reform the United States Postal Service. The legislation included a provision that would eliminate the retiree health benefits fund prefunding mandate, which required the Postal Service to set aside billions each year for retiree health benefits.

In 2019, DeFazio introduced the USPS Fairness Act, which would have solely repealed the prefunding mandate. In February 2020, the legislation passed the House, 309 to 106.

U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, included DeFazio&#x27;s provision to repeal the prefunding mandate in the Postal Service Reform Act, which President Biden signed into law on April 6, 2022.

=====Israel and Palestine=====
In 2015, DeFazio was one of 19 members of Congress to sign a letter urging Secretary of State John Kerry to &quot;prioritize the human rights of Palestinian children living in the Occupied West Bank in the bilateral relationship with the Government of Israel.&quot; The letter called Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinian children &quot;cruel, inhumane and degrading&quot; and an &quot;anomaly in the world&quot;. In 2017, he was one of 10 members of Congress to introduce a bill that would &quot;require the Secretary of State to certify that United States funds do not support military detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children&quot;.

=====Financial=====
In 2008, DeFazio and Representative Pete Stark signed a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposing a 0.25% transaction tax on all trades in financial instruments, including stocks, options, and futures. Subsequently, DeFazio introduced the &quot;No BAILOUT Act.&quot;

Somewhat controversially, DeFazio declined to support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, voting against it on February 13, 2009. He was one of only seven Democratic House members to vote against the bill. DeFazio said that his vote was due to his frustration over compromises made to win support from moderate Republicans in the Senate. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t justify borrowing money for tax cuts&quot;, he said, referring to a bipartisan group&#x27;s decision to cut funding for education and infrastructure initiatives he had supported in favor of steeper tax reductions. He also advocated that the U.S. Senate change its cloture rules, doing away with the filibuster.

DeFazio made headlines in mid-November 2009 when he suggested in an interview with MSNBC commentator Ed Schultz that Obama should fire Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers. &quot;We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get back millions for Americans&quot;, DeFazio said. The comment made top headlines at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. DeFazio also suggested that a formal call by the Congressional Progressive Caucus for Geithner and Summers to be removed might be forthcoming. A year later he called for the impeachment of Chief Justice John Roberts because of the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;.

In 2009, DeFazio proposed a financial transaction tax.

During his tenure, DeFazio has butted heads with fellow Democratic politicians, including Obama, on key Democratic legislation. In December 2010, he told CNN that the White House was &quot;putting on tremendous pressure&quot; about legislation extending the Bush tax cuts, with Obama &quot;making phone calls saying this is the end of his presidency if he doesn&#x27;t get this bad deal.&quot; White House spokesman Tommy Vietor told &quot;The Hill&quot; that Obama hadn&#x27;t &quot;said anything remotely like that&quot; and had &quot;never spoken with Mr. DeFazio about the issue&quot;.

=====Occupy Wall Street=====
In August 2011, DeFazio said that Obama lacked the fight to follow through on ending the Bush tax cuts, citing the pressure placed on him by the Republicans. DeFazio, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bernie Sanders said that it would be good for the Democratic Party if Obama faced a meaningful primary in which all the issues would be aired out.

In October 2011, Think Progress noted that DeFazio was echoing the demands of the Occupy Wall Street protesters by proposing to tax the trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives.

=====Fuel prices=====
DeFazio opposed the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress), a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill was intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices. DeFazio argued that the bill would not solve the true cause of high gas prices, which he blamed on &quot;Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street&quot;. DeFazio called the bill the &quot;drill everywhere&quot; bill.

In 2022, following a report from Accountable.US that showed the largest oil and gas companies in the United States made a record $205 billion profit in 2021, DeFazio introduced the Stop Gas Price Gouging Tax and Rebate Act. This legislation would impose a windfall profits tax on excessive corporate profits and return the revenue to Americans in monthly payments.

==== Health insurance reform ====
In 2020, DeFazio introduced legislation to repeal a law that allows insurance companies an exemption from antitrust enforcement. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act. It gives the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission the authority to apply federal antitrust laws to any potential anti-competitive behavior by health insurance companies. President Trump signed the legislation into law in January 2021.

===== Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund =====
In December 2020, DeFazio helped pass the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of 2020. This legislation included a measure he fought for for decades which would allow Congress to appropriate any funds collected from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for authorized harbor maintenance needs. This unlocked billions in already collected fees to support the infrastructure of federal ports and harbors.

===== Organic Farming Standards =====
DeFazio and Senator Patrick Leahy are credited with helping establish the National Organic Program in the 1990 Farm Bill.

DeFazio co-chairs the bipartisan House Organic Caucus.

In 2022, following news of his retirement, the Organic Trade Association honored DeFazio with the Organic Champion Award for his career-long work to support a strong organic label.

==U.S. Senate elections==
===1995===
After Senator Bob Packwood resigned in early September 1995, DeFazio ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in a special primary, losing to 3rd district Congressman Ron Wyden.

===1996===
DeFazio had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the seat of Senator Mark Hatfield, who announced after the special primary election that he would not seek reelection in 1996. Faced with the prospect of having to take on well-funded millionaires in both the primary and general election, DeFazio announced in February 1996 that he would not run.

===2008===
DeFazio again considered running for the United States Senate. At the time he was considered a top-tier candidate, but he later defused such talk, citing seniority and monetary concerns about a potential campaign.

== Personal life ==
DeFazio is a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He and his wife, Myrnie L. Daut, reside in Springfield.

<text>Harry Lyman Davis (January 25, 1878 – May 21, 1950) was an American politician of the Republican Party. He served as the 38th and 44th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio and as the 49th governor of Ohio.

==Life and career==
Davis was born in Cleveland, Ohio on January 25, 1878 in the Newburgh area to Evan and Barbara Jones Davis. He was of English and Welsh ancestry, all of his ancestors having emigrated to North America from Great Britain during the era of the Thirteen Colonies. At age thirteen, he left school to work in the steel mills, studying at home and night school. He became a solicitor for the Cleveland Telephone Co. at age twenty-one and later founded the Davis Rate Adjustment Co., selling telephone securities and the Harry L. Davis Co., selling insurance.

In 1909, Davis was elected Republican city treasurer. David defeated his opponent Peter Witt in the 1915 Cleveland mayoral election. As the city&#x27;s new mayor, Davis established the Mayor&#x27;s Advisory War Committee in 1917 to aid the American effort in World War I. As mayor Davis reached out to and supported immigrant ethnic communities in Cleveland. The Polish-American community voted for him &quot;almost unanimously&quot; in his 1915 mayoral election and supported him throughout the rest of his political career. He was known for being sensitive to the concerns of Polish immigrants and Italian immigrants in Cleveland. His work gained national recognition. Mayor Davis also had to deal with the communist May Day Riots of 1919 and the bombing of his home by communist agitators; the Red Scare presented a new set of dilemmas. Davis responded to the outrages by campaigning for the expulsion of all &quot;Bolsheviks&quot; from America. Since 1919 was an election year, Davis resigned from the mayor&#x27;s office and went on to successfully campaign for governor of Ohio. The Communist Party USA and the Socialist Party of America both unsuccessfully campaigned against him.

Davis won the governor&#x27;s seat and served one term. While in office, Davis restructured the executive branch to include a cabinet of seven directors to help administer state affairs. Davis did not run again in 1922, but rather 1924, when he was soundly defeated by incumbent A. Victor Donahey. Davis later returned to Cleveland and became a strong opponent of the city manager plan. He later served again as mayor from 1934 to 1935.

==Death==
In his later years, Davis suffered from frequent periods of ill health. He died at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, on May 21, 1950, soon after he was stricken with a blood clot in the brain. He was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

<text>&quot;para&quot;-Azoxyanisole (PAA) is an organic, aromatic compound. Its chemical formula is C14H14N2O3. In a solid state, it appears as a white powder, but when heated it forms a liquid crystal. As one of the first known and most readily prepared liquid crystals, PAA has played an important role in the development of liquid crystal displays.

Its liquid crystal range is from 118 °C to 136 °C. The solid to nematic transition is at 118 °C and the nematic to isotropic liquid transition at 136 °C.

<text>Arthur magazine was a bi-monthly periodical that was founded in October 2002, by publisher Laris Kreslins and editor Jay Babcock. It received favorable attention from other periodicals such as &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;, &quot;Punk Planet&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Arthur&quot; featured photography and artwork from Spike Jonze, Art Spiegelman, Susannah Breslin, Gary Panter and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Arthur&#x27;s regular columnists included Byron Coley, Thurston Moore, Daniel Pinchbeck, Paul Cullum, Douglas Rushkoff, and T-Model Ford. Some of the magazine&#x27;s influences included Joan Didion, Thomas Paine, William Blake, Lester Bangs, Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and Greil Marcus, as well and the exhibit and book &quot;A Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in Writing, 1960-1980&quot;.

&quot;Arthur&quot; magazine was particularly drawn to noise music, stoner metal, folk and other types of psychedelia. The first issue of &quot;Arthur&quot; featured an interview with journalist and author Daniel Pinchbeck (author of &quot;Breaking Open the Head&quot;); artwork by Alan Moore (&quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;From Hell&quot;, &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;); and an interview with Arthur C. Clarke.

Previous to creating the publication, Laris Kreslins created the popular music journals &quot;Sound Collector&quot; and &quot;Audio Review&quot;. Jay Babcock was a contributor to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine and the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;.

&quot;Arthur&quot; magazine also released CDs and DVDs under the imprint of their label. On Labor Day weekend in 2005, they curated Arthurfest in Barnsdall Park; in February 2006, Arthur Ball in Echo Park; and in October 2006 Arthur Nights at The Palace Theater, in downtown Los Angeles.

On February 25, 2007, it was announced on the magazine&#x27;s web site that it would be ceasing publication indefinitely. The hiatus was due to a breakdown in negotiations between Lime Publishing (&quot;Arthur&quot;″s original publisher) and another unnamed publisher. In April 2007, it was announced that the magazine would return as &quot;Arthur Vol. II&quot; in the near future. The magazine resumed publication in September 2007.

In June 2008, owner Jay Babcock moved Arthur&#x27;s headquarters from Los Angeles to New York, the seat of North America&#x27;s publishing industry.

On March 6, 2011, Jay Babcock announced that the magazine would cease to exist in any form as of March 15, 2011, though its archive and store would remain active for an unspecified period thereafter.

In November 2012, the &quot;Arthur&quot; website announced the return of the magazine as of December 22, 2012. However, this resurgence proved to be brief, and in March 2014 the magazine once again announced that its online and print versions would go dormant.

As of April 20, 2017, Jay Babcock announced the start of Landline bulletin, a continuation of Arthur Magazine email bulletin. As Babcock describes it, &quot;What is this stuff? Ideas and nudges, hopefully forming a small bailiwick outside the unceasing current of cruddiness — irregular epistles intended for friends, colleagues, Arthur heads, pastoral people, plant people, rural country people, dharma people, herbalists, gardeners, wild people and other curious sweetfolk.&quot;

<text>Earl Francis Blumenauer ( ; born August 16, 1948) is an American lawyer, author, and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1996 to 2025. The district includes most of Portland east of the Willamette River.

As a member of the Democratic Party, Blumenauer previously spent over 20 years as a public official in Portland, including serving on the Portland City Council from 1987 to 1996, when he succeeded Ron Wyden in the U.S. House of Representatives. Wyden was elected to the U.S. Senate after Bob Packwood resigned.

Blumenauer is known for his distinctive bow ties and neon bicycle lapel pins. Blumenauer gifts his signature bike pins to fellow congressmen, interns, and staffers.

Since January 2025, Blumenauer serves as a senior fellow at Portland State University and as special advisor to university president Ann Cudd.

==Early life and education==
Blumenauer was born in Portland on August 16, 1948. In 1966, he graduated from Centennial High School on Portland&#x27;s east side and then enrolled at Lewis &amp; Clark College. He majored in political science and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lewis &amp; Clark in 1970. Blumenauer completed his education in 1976 when he earned a Juris Doctor degree from the school&#x27;s Northwestern School of Law (now Lewis &amp; Clark Law School). Before starting law school in 1970 and until 1977, he worked as an assistant to the president of Portland State University.

==Early political career==
In 1969–70, Blumenauer organized and led Oregon&#x27;s &quot;Go 19&quot; campaign, an effort to lower the state voting age (while then unsuccessful, it supported the national trend that soon resulted in the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age to 18). In 1972, he was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives, representing the 11th district in Multnomah County. He was reelected in 1974 and 1976, and continued representing Portland and Multnomah County until the 1979 legislative session. From 1975 to 1981 he served on the board of Portland Community College. After his time in the Oregon legislature, he served on the Multnomah County Commission from 1979 to 1986. He lost a race for Portland City Council to Margaret Strachan in 1981. He left the county commission in March 1986 to run again for city council.

Blumenauer was elected to the Portland City Council in May 1986. His first term began in January 1987, and he remained on the council until 1996. From the start of his first term, he was named the city&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Works, which made him the council member in charge of the Portland Bureau of Transportation (also known as the Transportation Commissioner). During his time on the council, Blumenauer was appointed by Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt to the state&#x27;s commission on higher education, on which he served in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, Blumenauer was defeated by Vera Katz in an open race for mayor of Portland—to date, only the second time that Blumenauer has lost an election. At the time he was called &quot;the man who probably knows the most about how Portland works&quot;, but he left local politics to run for Congress. After winning election to Congress, he resigned from the city council in May 1996. In 2010, Blumenauer received The Ralph Lowell Award for outstanding contributions to public television.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Tenure===
Blumenauer was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1996 in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Ron Wyden to the U.S. Senate. He received 69% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark Brunelle. He was elected to a full term that November, and was reelected 10 times without serious difficulty in what has long been Oregon&#x27;s most Democratic district, never with less than 66% of the vote.

Blumenauer served as Oregon campaign chair for both John Kerry&#x27;s and Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaigns.

In Congress, Blumenauer is noted for his advocacy for mass transit, such as Portland&#x27;s MAX Light Rail and the Portland Streetcar, and, as a strong supporter of legislation promoting bicycle commuting, cycles from his Washington residence to the Capitol and even to the White House for meetings.

Among the bills Blumenauer has sponsored that have become law are the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004 and the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005. In addition, the Legal Timber Protection Act passed as part of the 2008 Farm Bill, while the Bicycle Commuter Act passed with the 2008 bailout bill.

Blumenauer was active in pressuring the United States to take greater action during the Darfur conflict.

In the political aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Blumenauer noted that he was among those who had pointed out the vulnerability of New Orleans and encouraged Congress to help that city and the gulf coast get better prepared:
* 2004: &quot;Barely have we recovered from Hurricane Hugo and we are seeing Hurricane Ivan pose the threat that has long been feared by those in Louisiana, that this actually might represent the loss of the City of New Orleans. Located 15 feet below sea level, there is the potential of a 30-foot wall of water putting at risk $100 billion of infrastructure and industry and countless lives.&quot;
* 2005: &quot;I recently had the opportunity to view the devastation in Southeast Asia as a result of the tsunami. As appalled as I was by what I saw, I must confess that occasionally my thoughts drifted back to the United States. What would have happened if last September, Hurricane Ivan had veered 40 miles to the west, devastating the city of New Orleans? One likely scenario would have had a tsunami-like 30-foot wall of water hitting the city, causing thousands of deaths and $100 billion in damage...The experience of Southeast Asia should convince us all of the urgent need for congressional action to prevent wide-scale loss of life and economic destruction at home and abroad. Prevention and planning will pay off. Maybe the devastation will encourage us to act before disaster strikes.&quot;
Blumenauer supports the World Trade Organization and has voted for free trade agreements with Peru, Australia, Singapore, Chile, Africa, and the Caribbean. His support for these agreements has angered progressives, environmental and labor activists. In 2004, he voted against the Central America Free Trade Agreement. On September 24, 2007, four labor and human rights activists were arrested in Blumenauer&#x27;s office protesting his support for the Peru Free Trade Agreement.

In February 2009, after a domesticated chimpanzee in Connecticut severely mauled a woman, gaining national attention, Blumenauer sponsored the Captive Primate Safety Act to bar the sale or purchase of non-human primates for personal possession between states and from outside the country. In June 2008, Blumenauer had sponsored legislation to ban interstate trafficking of great apes, which had passed in the House but been tabled by the Senate.

Blumenauer received some media attention during the political debate over health care reform for sponsoring an amendment to the America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 to change procedures to mandate that Medicare pay for end-of-life counseling. The amendment, as introduced, was based on an earlier proposal cosponsored by Blumenauer and Republican Representative Charles Boustany of Louisiana. The amendment generated controversy, with conservative figures, such as 2008 vice presidential nominee and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, suggesting that the amendment, if made law, would be used as a cover for the federal government to set up &quot;death panels&quot; that would be used to determine which people received medical treatment. Blumenauer called the claim &quot;mind-numbing&quot; and an &quot;all-time low.&quot; His rebuke was echoed by Republican Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who called the death panels claim &quot;nuts.&quot;

On July 24, 2014, Blumenauer introduced the Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 (H.R. 5195; 113th Congress), a bill that would authorize an additional 1,000 emergency Special Immigrant Visas that the United States Department of State could issue to Afghan translators who served with U.S. troops during the War in Afghanistan. He argued that &quot;a failure to provide these additional visas ensures the many brave translators the U.S. promised to protect in exchange for their services would be left in Afghanistan, hiding, their lives still threatened daily by the Taliban.&quot;

Blumenauer skipped all of President Trump&#x27;s State of the Union addresses, saying, &quot;I refuse to be a witness to his continued antics.&quot; In 2019 he was one of the first lawmakers to come out in support of the Green New Deal.

In July 2019, Blumenauer voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider opposing efforts to boycott the State of Israel and the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting the existence of Israel, and the return of Jewish sovereignty. The resolution passed 398–17.

In November 2020, Blumenauer was named a candidate for Secretary of Transportation in the incoming Biden administration. Pete Buttigieg was eventually chosen instead.

During the 117th Congress, Blumenauer voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 99.1% of the time according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

Blumenauer voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

On October 30, 2023, Blumenauer announced he would not run for re-election in 2024.

On July 10, 2024, Blumenauer called for Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election.

<doc id="699497" wikidata="Q5611004" url="?curid=699497" title="Tim Collins (politician)">
<text>Timothy William George Collins, CBE (born 7 May 1964) is a British politician, once a prominent member of the Conservative Party. Collins was active in the 1990s and was later the Member of Parliament (MP) for Westmorland and Lonsdale in north-west England from 1997 until his defeat at the 2005 general election by Tim Farron, later leader of the Liberal Democrats.

==Education==
Collins was educated at Chigwell School, the London School of Economics (BSc) and King&#x27;s College London (MA).

==Political career==
Collins had significant political experience before his election to Parliament. He acted as Press Secretary to the then Prime Minister John Major, serving in that role during the successful 1992 general election campaign. He was a member of the 10 Downing Street Policy Unit and was a speechwriter to Margaret Thatcher, John Major, William Hague, David Hunt, Michael Howard, Chris Patten, Norman Fowler and Brian Mawhinney.

Collins was appointed a CBE in the Birthday Honours List in 1996, at the age of 32. The award was given &#x27;for political services&#x27;.

According to &quot;The Almanac of British Politics&quot;, Collins was selected to fight Westmorland and Lonsdale, then considered a safe seat for the Conservatives, at 1997 general election &quot;partly through his family&#x27;s farming background, but more by his endorsement from John Major. When elected to parliament in 1997, Collins was the second youngest Conservative MP, after Graham Brady who was three years his junior.

During his time in Parliament, Collins served as a Whip and later as a Senior Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party. In this role, in the run up to the 2001 election, Collins was a senior aide to the then Conservative leader William Hague. Collins supported the focus on tax cuts and opposition to the Euro that characterised that campaign.

After the election, the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office later moving him to Shadow Transport Secretary. When Michael Howard became leader in 2003 he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education.

In this post, he developed policies to give anonymity for accused teachers until a court trial, to allow successful schools to expand and to stop the closure of schools for children with Special Educational Needs.

At the 2005 general election, he lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Tim Farron, by a margin of 267 votes. It has been suggested that this was due to a Liberal Democrat &quot;decapitation&quot; strategy which was aimed at unseating senior Conservative candidates.

In 2006, he was reported to be part of the so-called &quot;A-List&quot; of priority parliamentary candidates whom the Conservative leadership most wished to see in Parliament after the next general election, but, in April 2008, the &quot;ConservativeHome&quot; website reported that he left the Conservative candidate list, quoting him as saying &quot;I firmly now do not wish to return to the House of Commons&quot;.

== Lobbyist ==
In October 2009, Collins was appointed Managing Director of Bell Pottinger Public Affairs, one of the UK&#x27;s largest lobbying companies, replacing David Sowells and reporting to Chairman Peter Bingle. BPPA is part of Chime Communications plc, created and chaired by Lord Bell, the former advertising and communications adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s. In the December 2009 edition of &quot;PA News&quot;, a magazine covering the lobbying industry, Shadow Arts Minister Ed Vaizey MP praised the hiring of Collins, saying he had &quot;a huge brain&quot; and would be &quot;a huge asset&quot; to the company. In the same issue, Charles Lewington, MD of consultancy Hanover, said it was &quot;a smart hire by Tim Bell&quot; while the man who beat Collins in 2005, Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron, said it was &quot;very good news for Bell Pottinger&quot;. In December 2011, &quot;The Independent&quot; claimed that Collins had been filmed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism saying that PM David Cameron had raised a copyright issue with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao on behalf of Dyson Limited &quot;because we asked him to&quot;.

==Television==
Collins is a fan of the British science-fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and has appeared on television several times to discuss the programme.

In a 2003 DVD documentary &quot;Putting the Shock into Earthshock&quot; (included as part of the BBC Worldwide DVD release of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Earthshock&quot;), he jokingly stated that the Cybermen were more convincing when the Conservatives were in power. He was also reported to have read &quot;The Dying Days&quot; in one sitting on the night of the 1997 general election so that he could claim to have read the whole New Adventures series while the Conservatives were in government.

Collins has also appeared as a guest on a number of current affairs programmes since leaving Parliament.

<doc id="699498" wikidata="Q5141804" url="?curid=699498" title="Col (game)">
<text>Col is a pencil and paper game, specifically a map-coloring game, involving the shading of areas in a line drawing according to the rules of graph coloring. With each move, the graph must remain proper (no two areas of the same colour may touch), and a player who cannot make a legal move loses. The game was described and analysed by John Conway, who attributed it to Colin Vout, in &quot;On Numbers and Games&quot;.

== Example game ==

In the following game, the first of the two players is using red, and the second is using blue. The last move in each image is shown brighter than the other areas.


The first player may colour any of the areas to begin. However, the region around the outside of the graph is not included as an area for this game.


The second player now colours a white cell. As no areas are currently blue, any white cell is allowed.


At this point, the requirement that the graph be proper comes into effect, as a red area must be made which does not touch the existing one:


Note that areas only count as touching if they share edges, not if they only share vertices, so this move is legal.

The game continues, players moving alternately, until one player cannot make a move. This player loses. A possible continuation of the game is as follows (with each move numbered for clarity):


In this outcome, the blue player has lost.

== Snort ==
Snort, invented by Simon P. Norton, uses a similar partisan assignment of two colors, but with the anticlassical constraint: neighboring regions are not allowed to be given different colors. Coloring the regions is explained as assigning fields to bulls and cows, where neighboring fields may not contain cattle of the opposite sex, lest they be distracted from their grazing.

Deciding the outcome in Snort is PSPACE-complete on general graphs. This is proven by reducing partizan node Kayles, which is PSPACE-complete, to a game of Snort.

== Analysis ==
The value of a Col position is always either a number or a number plus star This makes the game relatively simple compared with Snort, which features a much greater variety of values.

<doc id="699501" wikidata="Q7803338" url="?curid=699501" title="Tim Collins (British Army officer)">
<text>Colonel Timothy Thomas Cyril Collins (born 30 April 1960) is a retired Northern Irish military officer in the British Army. He is best known for his role in the Iraq War in 2003, and his eve-of-battle speech, which President George W. Bush had displayed on the White House&#x27;s Oval Office. He is chairman (and co-founder) of intelligence-based security services company Horus Global. Collins unsuccessfully stood for the Ulster Unionist Party in the seat of North Down in the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

==Early life==
Collins was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he grew up during The Troubles. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution before attending Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, where he gained a degree in economics.

==Military career==
After graduating from university, Collins was accepted into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned into the Royal Signals as a second lieutenant on a short service commission on 2 October 1981. He was promoted to lieutenant with seniority from 7 April 1982. He transferred to the Royal Irish Rangers on 18 October 1982. He switched to a full commission on 22 October 1984, and was promoted captain on 7 October 1985.

He passed selection into the SAS in 1988, going on to serve 2 operational tours with the Regiment and 1 tour at HQ Special Forces in York barracks London

He was promoted major on 30 September 1992, and lieutenant-colonel on 30 June 1999. Collins was appointed commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment in 2001. For a tour of duty in Northern Ireland between October 2001 and March 2002, he was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Valuable Service on 29 October 2002. It was in the capacity of 1 R Irish&#x27;s commanding officer that he rose to prominence while serving in Iraq.

On 31 October 2003 he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for his service in Iraq and was invested on 7 April 2004. Collins was promoted to colonel and moved to the General Staff on 30 June 2003.

He set up the Peace Support College in Sarajevo before becoming DACOS Training at HQ Land Command until his retirement.

===Eve-of-battle speech===
As Lieutenant Colonel (Commanding Officer) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment of the British Army, Collins gave a rousing eve-of-battle speech to his troops in Kuwait on Wednesday 19 March 2003. The speech was extemporised, and was recorded in shorthand by a single journalist, Sarah Oliver. No recording or film of the speech exists, Collins told the BBC.

====Speech excerpt====
====In popular culture====
The &quot;Mark of Cain&quot; line from the speech inspired the title of the 2007 Film4 Productions drama &quot;The Mark of Cain&quot;. In the film a commanding officer makes a speech based on Collins&#x27; to his men.

The last episode of the 2008 television series &quot;10 Days to War&quot; features a version of the speech performed by Kenneth Branagh as Collins.

===Accusations of detainee mistreatment===

In 2003, Collins was accused by Major Re Biastre of the US Army&#x27;s 402nd Civil Affairs Battalion of mistreating Iraqi detainees. In Biastre&#x27;s allegations, he stated that he had never seen any of the alleged mistreatment personally, but had instead overheard them being discussed by British and American military personnel. The Royal Military Police (RMP) opened an investigation into Biastre&#x27;s claims, during which it found that Biastre had been verbally reprimanded by Collins and made to stand at attention for 45 minutes for distributing sweets to Iraqi children against explicit orders not to do so. The allegations were denounced by USMC Major Stan Coerr, who stated in an interview that &quot;I didn’t see any of these incidents and I don’t for a second believe them. The fact is that this whole thing was started by an incompetent officer lashing out at someone who embarrassed him in front of his troops.&quot; Several Royal Irish Regiment soldiers who had served under Collins signed testimonies supporting his refutations of Biastre&#x27;s allegations. In September 2003, the Ministry of Defence announced that the RMP investigation had concluded that Collins was innocent of all charges and would not be prosecuted. Collins subsequently sued the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; in the High Court of Northern Ireland for libel over their reporting of the allegations, winning a substantial amount of undisclosed damages from them. After Collins&#x27; court victory, his solicitor Ernie Telford stated that the allegations &quot;have caused immense distress to my client, his wife and children.&quot;

==Post-military career==
He officially left the British Army on 5 August 2004.

===Media appearances===
Since leaving the Army, Collins&#x27; views on the Iraq conflict and other military issues have been widely sought. In 2007, Collins was host of a three-part documentary called &quot;Ships That Changed the World&quot; for BBC Northern Ireland. In December 2008 – during an interview on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, Collins said that, when he left in 2004, the British Army was already undermanned for existing commitments. In February 2011 Tim Collins appeared on the BBC news programme &quot;Panorama&quot; in a special entitled &#x27;Forgotten Heroes&#x27;. In the documentary, Collins meets veterans struggling to cope with civilian life and sleeps rough on the streets of Brighton with another former soldier.

===Politics===
Collins has been approached by both the Conservative Party and the Ulster Unionist Party to run for Parliament, and confirmed in January 2024 that he would run for the Ulster Unionist Party in the 2024 United Kingdom general election. During the 2005 Ulster Unionist leadership election he was cited by a number of prominent Ulster Unionists as an outside figure who would make a good leader, but Collins declined as he felt he had &quot;no experience of politics.&quot; Collins is a signatory of the founding statement of principles of the Henry Jackson Society, which advocates a pro-active approach to the spread of liberal democracy through the world. He has recently been critical of the Iraq war: &quot;the UK and US pour blood and treasure into overseas campaigns which seem to have no ending and no goal ... Clearly I was naive&quot;.

In December 2011, it was revealed that Collins was approached to stand as an elected police and crime commissioner for the Conservative Party in Kent and originally was standing, however he later dropped out of the race. In August 2014, Collins was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.
In January 2024, Collins confirmed that he will run for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in the 2024 United Kingdom general election. He said that it was the right time to for a new career path, and he chose to run for the UUP because their views and values are compatible with his own. The Democratic Unionist Party previously asked Collins to run for them but he turned down the offer. He contested the North Down constituency and made controversial statements regarding the cost of insuring his Rolls-Royce.
He finished third with 15.6% of the vote, and attributed his loss to voters being more interested in &quot;potholes and hedges&quot; than international affairs.

===Business career===

Collins is chairman of specialist security company, Horus Global.

<text>Honolulu Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium located in the Moiliili district of Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i, at the corner of King and Isenberg Streets. Opened in 1926, it was the primary sports venue in Hawaii preceding Aloha Stadium. During its final years, the stadium could hold about 25,000 fans; it was demolished in 1976. A public park, Old Stadium Park, now occupies the location. A plaque at the corner of King and Isenberg commemorates the stadium. Some of the property wall that stood behind the stands on the west end still remains.

==Description==
The stadium was bounded by King Street (north, third base); Isenberg Street (east, left field); Citron Street and Date Street (south, right field); and Makahiki Way (west, first base). It was catty-corner to, and replaced, Mo&#x27;ili&#x27;ili Field as the venue of choice for the University of Hawaii&#x27;s athletic teams. Mo&#x27;ili&#x27;ili Field stood on the northeast corner of King and Isenberg, and was also bounded by South Beretania Street to the north and east. It still exists, in the form of &quot;Mo&#x27;ili&#x27;ili Neighborhood Park&quot;, which has two ballfields within it.

In the baseball configuration, home plate was in the northwest corner; the third base line ran along King, and left field seating was bounded on the east by Isenberg. Field dimensions mentioned in local newspapers varied somewhat, but the consensus appears to be: left field , right field , and center field . The football field ran parallel to the third base line, but away from the infield; the west end zone was near the first base line and the gridiron ran east-southeast, through right field and center field. The sideline seating for football was in right field and along the third base line.

==History==
The stadium was owned throughout most of its history by Honolulu Stadium, Ltd., a private entity that was incorporated for $150,000 in 1926. As of 1943, the stadium was leased to the University of Hawaii. By the 1960s, Honolulu Stadium had long since reached the end of its useful life. It was made mostly of wood and was frequently attacked by termites, resulting in it being nicknamed &quot;the Termite Palace&quot;. In January 1975, the State of Hawaii purchased the stadium for $8.5 million—at that time, the University held a majority of the shares of Honolulu Stadium, Ltd.

The stadium was the longtime home of the University of Hawaii&#x27;s college football team (then known as the Hawaii Rainbows) from 1926 to 1974, and the minor league baseball Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) from 1961 to 1975. In its final years, the stadium also was home to The Hawaiians of the World Football League (WFL) in 1974 and 1975.

The stadium was the venue for several bowl games: the Poi Bowl (1936–1939, 1945), Pineapple Bowl (1940–1941, 1947–1952), and Hula Bowl (1960–1975). It also hosted high school football, world championship boxing matches, and was used for stock car racing. Track was also run at the stadium; it was the site of Hawaii&#x27;s first night track meet in 1949.

Famous athletes who competed in Honolulu Stadium include Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth in 1934; Joe DiMaggio, who hit a home run out of the park while playing for a military team in 1944; and Jesse Owens, who outran a horse in an 80-yard dash at the stadium in 1946. Irving Berlin performed at the stadium in 1945, Elvis Presley performed in 1957, and Billy Graham inspired a capacity crowd a year later.

The 1971 Hawaii Rainbows football team hosted the undefeated and top-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers at the stadium in early December. The defending national champions were fresh off their &quot;Game of the Century&quot; win on Thanksgiving at No. 2 Oklahoma, and defeated the Rainbows, 45–3. Nebraska went on to defeat Alabama in the 1972 Orange Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day for a 13–0 season.

In the stadium&#x27;s final event, the Islanders won their first PCL championship over the Salt Lake Gulls, in six games concluding on September 8, 1975. The stadium was replaced by Aloha Stadium in Halawa, which opened the following week.
