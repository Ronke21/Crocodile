<text>Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a type of severe reaction that occurs in response to particular medications used during general anesthesia, among those who are susceptible. Symptoms include muscle rigidity, fever, and a fast heart rate. Complications can include muscle breakdown and high blood potassium. Most people who are susceptible to MH are generally unaffected when not exposed to triggering agents.
Exposure to triggering agents (certain volatile anesthetic agents or succinylcholine) can lead to the development of MH in those who are susceptible. Susceptibility can occur due to at least six genetic mutations, with the most common one being of the &quot;RYR1&quot; gene. These genetic variations are often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The condition may also occur as a new mutation or be associated with a number of inherited muscle diseases, such as central core disease.
In susceptible individuals, the medications induce the release of stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in calcium concentrations within the cells cause the muscle fibers to contract. This generates excessive heat and results in metabolic acidosis. Diagnosis is based on symptoms in the appropriate situation. Family members may be tested to see if they are susceptible by muscle biopsy or genetic testing.
Treatment is with dantrolene and rapid cooling along with other supportive measures. The avoidance of potential triggers is recommended in susceptible people. The condition affects one in 5,000 to 50,000 cases where people are given anesthetic gases. Males are more often affected than females. The risk of death with proper treatment is about 5% while without it is around 75%. While cases that appear similar to MH have been documented since the early 20th century, the condition was only formally recognized in 1960.
==Signs and symptoms==
The typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis. These signs can develop any time during the administration of the anesthetic triggering agents. Rarely, signs may develop up to 40 minutes after the end of anaesthesia.

==Causes==
Malignant hyperthermia is a disorder that can be considered a gene–environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger. In fact, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), predisposed by mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1), is one of the most severe heat-related illnesses. The MHS-associated heat susceptibilities predominantly affect children and metabolically active young adults, often leading to life- threatening hypermetabolic responses to heat.

Other anesthetic drugs do not trigger malignant hyperthermia. Some examples of drugs that don&#x27;t cause MH include local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine), opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, and benzodiazepines. The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants pancuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, vecuronium and rocuronium also are generally thought to be safe for patients MH.

There is mounting evidence that some individuals with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments.

===Genetics===
Malignant hyperthermia&#x27;s inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. The defect is typically located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2) involving the ryanodine receptor. More than 25 different mutations in this gene are linked with malignant hyperthermia. These mutations tend to cluster in one of three domains within the protein, designated MH1-3. MH1 and MH2 are located in the N-terminus of the protein, which interacts with L-type calcium channels and . MH3 is located in the transmembrane forming C-terminus. This region is important for allowing passage through the protein following opening.

Chromosome 7q and chromosome 17 have also been implicated. It has also been postulated that MH and central core disease may be allelic and thus can be co-inherited.

==Pathophysiology==

===Disease mechanism===
In a large proportion (50–70%) of cases, the propensity for malignant hyperthermia is due to a mutation of the ryanodine receptor (type 1), located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the organelle within skeletal muscle cells that stores calcium. RYR1 opens in response to conformational changes in the L-type calcium channels following membrane depolarisation, thereby resulting in a drastic increase in intracellular calcium levels and muscle contraction. RYR1 has two sites believed to be important for reacting to changing concentrations: the A-site and the I-site. The A-site is a high affinity binding site that mediates RYR1 opening. The I-site is a lower affinity site that mediates the protein&#x27;s closing. Caffeine, halothane, and other triggering agents act by drastically increasing the affinity of the A-site for and concomitantly decreasing the affinity of the I-site in mutant proteins. also affect RYR1 activity, causing the protein to close by acting at either the A- or I-sites. In MH mutant proteins, the affinity for at either one of these sites is greatly reduced. The result of these alterations is greatly increased release due to a lowered activation and heightened deactivation threshold. The process of sequestering this excess consumes large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy carrier, and generates the excessive heat (hyperthermia) that is the hallmark of the disease. The muscle cell is damaged by the depletion of ATP and possibly the high temperatures, and cellular constituents &quot;leak&quot; into the circulation, including potassium, myoglobin, creatine, phosphate and creatine kinase.

The other known causative gene for MH is &quot;CACNA1S&quot;, which encodes an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel α-subunit. There are two known mutations in this protein, both affecting the same residue, R1086. This residue is located in the large intracellular loop connecting domains 3 and 4, a domain possibly involved in negatively regulating RYR1 activity. When these mutant channels are expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells, the resulting channels are five times more sensitive to activation by caffeine (and presumably halothane) and activate at 5–10mV more hyperpolarized. Furthermore, cells expressing these channels have an increased basal cytosolic concentration. As these channels interact with and activate RYR1, these alterations result in a drastic increase of intracellular , and, thereby, muscle excitability.

Other mutations causing MH have been identified, although in most cases the relevant gene remains to be identified.

===Animal model===
Research into malignant hyperthermia was limited until the discovery of &quot;porcine stress syndrome&quot; (PSS) in Danish Landrace and other pig breeds selected for muscling, a condition in which stressed pigs develop &quot;pale, soft, exudative&quot; flesh (a manifestation of the effects of malignant hyperthermia) rendering their meat less marketable at slaughter. This &quot;awake triggering&quot; was not observed in humans, and initially cast doubts on the value of the animal model, but subsequently, susceptible humans were discovered to &quot;awake trigger&quot; (develop malignant hyperthermia) in stressful situations. This supported the use of the pig model for research. Pig farmers use halothane cones in swine yards to expose piglets to halothane. Those that die were MH-susceptible, thus saving the farmer the expense of raising a pig whose meat he would not be able to market. This also reduced the use of breeding stock carrying the genes for PSS. The condition in swine is also due to a defect in ryanodine receptors.

Gillard &quot;et al.&quot; discovered the causative mutation in humans only after similar mutations had first been described in pigs.

Horses also develop malignant hyperthermia. A causative mutated allele, ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RyR1) at nucleotide C7360G, generating a R2454G amino acid substitution. has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry, inherited as an autosomal dominant. It can be caused by overwork, anesthesia, or stress. In dogs, its inheritance is autosomal recessive.

An MH mouse has been constructed, bearing the R163C mutation prevalent in humans. These mice display signs similar to human MH patients, including sensitivity to halothane (increased respiration, body temperature, and death). Blockade of RYR1 by dantrolene prevents adverse reaction to halothane in these mice, as with humans. Muscle from these mice also shows increased -induced depolarization and an increased caffeine sensitivity.

==Diagnosis==

===During an attack===
The earliest signs may include: masseter muscle contracture following administration of succinylcholine, a rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (despite increased minute ventilation), unexplained tachycardia, and muscle rigidity. Despite the name, elevation of body temperature is often a late sign, but may appear early in severe cases. Respiratory acidosis is universally present and many patients have developed metabolic acidosis at the time of diagnosis. A fast rate of breathing (in a spontaneously breathing patient), cyanosis, hypertension, abnormal heart rhythms, and high blood potassium may also be seen. Core body temperatures should be measured in any patient undergoing general anesthesia longer than 30 minutes.

Malignant hyperthermia is diagnosed on clinical grounds, but various laboratory investigations may prove confirmatory. These include a raised creatine kinase level, elevated potassium, increased phosphate (leading to decreased calcium) and—if determined—raised myoglobin; this is the result of damage to muscle cells. Severe rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute kidney failure, so kidney function is generally measured on a frequent basis. Patients may also experience premature ventricular contractions due to the increased levels of potassium released from the muscles during episodes.

===Susceptibility testing===

====Muscle testing====
The main candidates for testing are those with a close relative who has had an episode of MH or have been shown to be susceptible. The standard procedure is the &quot;caffeine-halothane contracture test&quot;, CHCT. A muscle biopsy is carried out at an approved research center, under local anesthesia. The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or halothane and observed for contraction; under good conditions, the sensitivity is 97% and the specificity 78%. Negative biopsies are &quot;not&quot; definitive, so any patient who is suspected of MH by their medical history or that of blood relatives is generally treated with non-triggering anesthetics, even if the biopsy was negative. Some researchers advocate the use of the &quot;calcium-induced calcium release&quot; test in addition to the CHCT to make the test more specific.

Less invasive diagnostic techniques have been proposed. Intramuscular injection of halothane 6 vol% has been shown to result in higher than normal increases in local among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 75%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study, this leads to a positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 100%. This method may provide a suitable alternative to more invasive techniques.
A 2002 study examined another possible metabolic test. In this test, intramuscular injection of caffeine was followed by local measurement of the ; those with known MH susceptibility had a significantly higher (63 versus 44 mmHg). The authors propose larger studies to assess the test&#x27;s suitability for determining MH risk.

====Genetic testing====
Genetic testing is being performed in a limited fashion to determine susceptibility to MH. In people with a family history of MH, analysis for &quot;RYR1&quot; mutations may be useful.

===Criteria===
A 1994 consensus conference led to the formulation of a set of diagnostic criteria. The higher the score (above 6), the more likely a reaction constituted MH:
* Respiratory acidosis (end-tidal above 55 mmHg/7.32 kPa or arterial above 60 mmHg/7.98 kPa)
* Heart involvement (unexplained sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)
* Metabolic acidosis (base excess lower than -8, pH &lt;7.25)
* Muscle rigidity (generalized rigidity including severe masseter muscle rigidity)
* Muscle breakdown (CK &gt;20,000/L units, cola colored urine or excess myoglobin in urine or serum, potassium above 6 mmol/L)
* Temperature increase (rapidly increasing temperature, T &gt;38.8 °C)
* Other (rapid reversal of MH signs with dantrolene, elevated resting serum CK levels)
* Family history (autosomal dominant pattern)

==Prevention==
In the past, the prophylactic use of dantrolene was recommended for MH-susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, multiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of trigger-free general anesthesia in these patients in the absence of prophylactic dantrolene administration. The largest of these studies looked at the charts of 2214 patients who underwent general or regional anesthesia for an elective muscle biopsy. About half (1082) of the patients were muscle biopsy positive for MH. Only five of these patients exhibited signs consistent with MH, four of which were treated successfully with dantrolene, and the remaining one recovered with only symptomatic therapy. After weighing its questionable benefits against its possible adverse effects (including nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and prolonged duration of action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents), experts no longer recommend the use of prophylactic dantrolene prior to trigger-free general anesthesia in MH-susceptible patients.

=== Anesthesia machine preparation ===
Anesthesia for people with known MH susceptible requires avoidance of triggering agent concentrations above 5 parts per million (all volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine). Most other drugs are safe (including nitrous oxide), as are regional anesthetic techniques. Where general anesthesia is planned, it can be provided safely by either flushing the machine or using charcoal filters.

To flush the machine, first remove or disable the vaporizers and then flush the machine with 10 L/min or greater fresh gas flow rate for at least 20 minutes. While flushing the machine the ventilator should be set to periodically ventilate a new breathing circuit. The soda lime should also be replaced. After machine preparation, anesthesia should be induced and maintained with non-triggering agents. The time required to flush a machine varies for different machines and volatile anesthetics. This prevention technique was optimized to prepare older generation anesthesia machines. Modern anesthetic machines have more rubber and plastic components which provide a reservoir for volatile anesthetics, and should be flushed for 60 minutes.

Charcoal filters can be used to prepare an anesthesia machine in less than 60 seconds for people at risk of malignant hyperthermia. These filters prevent residual anesthetic from triggering malignant hyperthermia for up to 12 hours, even at low fresh gas flows. Prior to placing the charcoal filters, the machine should be flushed with fresh gas flows greater than 10 L/min for 90 seconds.

==Treatment==

The current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia.

===Dantrolene===
Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that appears to work directly on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium. After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene, the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 5%. Dantrolene remains the only drug known to be effective in the treatment of MH. The recommended dose of dantrolene is 2.5 mg/kg, repeated as necessary. It is recommended that each hospital keeps a minimum stock of 36 dantrolene vials (720 mg), sufficient for four doses in a 70-kg person.

===Training===

Fast recognition and treatment of MH utilizes skills and procedures that are utilized with a low-frequency and high-risk. Conducting MH crisis training for perioperative teams can identify system failures as well as improve response to these events. Simulation techniques to include the use of cognitive aids have also been shown to improve communication in clinical treatment of MH.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is poor if this condition is not aggressively treated. In the 1970s, mortality was greater than 80%; however, with the current management mortality is now less than 5%.

==Epidemiology==
It occurs in between 1:5,000 and 1:100,000 in procedures involving general anaesthesia. This disorder occurs worldwide and affects all racial groups.

In the Manawatu region of New Zealand, up to 1 in 200 people are at high risk of the condition.

==History==
The syndrome was first recognized in Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia in an affected family by Denborough &quot;et al.&quot; in 1962. Denborough did much of his subsequent work on the condition at the Royal Canberra Hospital. Similar reactions were found in pigs. The efficacy of dantrolene as a treatment was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a 1975 article published in the &quot;British Journal of Anaesthesia&quot;. After further animal studies corroborated the possible benefit from dantrolene, a 1982 study confirmed its usefulness in humans.

In 1981, the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) hotline was established to provide telephone support to clinical teams treating patients with suspected malignant hyperthermia. The hotline became active in 1982 and since that time MHAUS has provided continuous access to board-certified anesthesiologists to assist teams in treatment.

==Other animals==
Other animals, including certain pig breeds, dogs, and horses, are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.

In dogs its inheritance is autosomal dominant. The syndrome has been reported in Pointers, Greyhounds, Labrador Retrievers, Saint Bernards, Springer Spaniels, Bichon Frises, Golden Retrievers, and Border Collies.

In pigs its inheritance is autosomal recessive.

In horses its inheritance is autosomal dominant, and most associated with the American Quarter Horse although it can occur in other breeds.

==Research==
Azumolene is a 30-fold more water-soluble analog of dantrolene that also works to decrease the release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor. In MH-susceptible swine, azumolene was as potent as dantrolene. It has yet to be studied &quot;in vivo&quot; in humans, but may present a suitable alternative to dantrolene in the treatment of MH.

<text>Stephen Franks (born 1950) in Wellington, New Zealand, is a commercial lawyer. At one time, he was chairman and Partner of the large firm Chapman Tripp. Franks has been a member of two political parties. He previously served as a List MP for the right-wing ACT New Zealand (Association of Consumers and Taxpayers). He then stood unsuccessfully for the National Party for the 2008 general election. Franks is also a media commentator and writer on legal and commercial topics; and is married with three daughters and a son in their 30s.

==Early life==
Franks was first educated at Taihape College, and then at Victoria where he studied Law (attained qualifications include BA/LLB (Hons) and Dip. Acc.). Franks was subsequently admitted to the bar in 1975.

Prior to entering Parliament in 1999 Franks&#x27; professional appointments included: being a member of the Securities Commission, Deputy chairman (1999–1999) of the Market Surveillance Panel of the New Zealand Stock Exchange having been a member of the MSP from its inception for nine years, and a Council member of the Institute of Directors in New Zealand.

==Member of Parliament: 1999–2005==

Franks entered Parliament in the , having been ranked in third place on the party list for the ACT Party, and coming fourth in electorate. This high ranking (above several sitting MPs) was indicative of ACT&#x27;s high hopes for Franks at the time – as a prominent lawyer, he was generally regarded as a significant asset for the party. In he stood in which had been won by ACT&#x27;s Richard Prebble in . During his six years in Parliament he was ACT spokesman for Justice, Corrections, the Police and Commerce. He added Maori Affairs and Sport in the last three years.

When Prebble announced his retirement from politics in early 2004, Franks was one of the four candidates who sought to take his place as leader of ACT. Franks ran on a platform of restoring the party&#x27;s core message. Despite receiving the endorsement of party founder Roger Douglas, he was eventually defeated by Rodney Hide. After Hide became leader of the ACT party on 13 June, Franks remained the party&#x27;s spokesperson for justice.

==2005 election==
Franks lost his seat in Parliament in the 2005 general election when the total percentage of the popular vote for ACT reduced the ACT Party to two seats in Parliament. He subsequently returned to practising law, rejoining his old firm, Chapman Tripp as a consultant. He later left this firm to set up his own commercial and public law practice, Franks &amp; Ogilvie

==2008 election and after==
Franks was National Party candidate for for the 2008 general election, being number 60 on the National Party list. He lost the contest by 1904 votes to Labour&#x27;s Grant Robertson.

His business interests presently centre around his public law practice, several company directorships, farming and manuka honey beekeeping.

<text>The Ungava Peninsula (), officially  (), is the far northwestern part of the Labrador Peninsula of the province of Quebec, Canada. Bounded by Hudson Bay to the west, Hudson Strait to the north, and Ungava Bay to the east, it covers about . Its northernmost point is Cape Wolstenholme, which is also the northernmost point of Quebec. The peninsula is also part of the Canadian Shield, and consists entirely of treeless tundra dissected by large numbers of rivers and glacial lakes, flowing generally east–west in a parallel fashion. The peninsula was not deglaciated until 6,500 years ago (11,500 years after the Last Glacial Maximum) and is believed to have been the prehistoric centre from which the vast Laurentide Ice Sheet spread over most of North America during the last glacial epoch.

The Unavuk Peninsula is part of the Nunavik proposed autonomous area of Quebec.

== Demographics ==
The Ungava Peninsula has an estimated population of 10,000 inhabitants. These are 90% Inuit, and live in 12 villages spread along the coast. The largest village, Kuujjuaq, is the capital of the Kativik Regional Government, which includes all of the peninsula. The peninsula&#x27;s offshore islands are part of the Nunavut Territory. The region is accessible by air services, with links to southern Québec, and seasonal shipping when sea-ice breaks up. Thick permafrost prevents the use of conventional building techniques in some areas.

== Geology ==
The Ungava Peninsula is situated on the northeast portion of the Canadian Shield where the Rae Province connects with the Superior Province. The region is composed of Archean rocks (ca. 2.7–2.9 Ga) from the Douglas Harbour Domain (see Superior Craton). The Archean rocks are overlain by Paleoproterozoic supracrustal sequences (ca. 1.8–2.1 Ga) and intruded by Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes (ca. 2.0–2.2 Ga). The supracrustal rocks comprise nappes that form part of the Ungava and Labrador troughs. In the zone east of the Labrador Trough axis, the Paleoproterozoic deformation reworked the Archean rocks of the Douglas Harbour Domain, as well as the Paleoproterozoic diabase dykes. The metamorphic conditions which parallel the deformation increase from west to east and from middle amphibolite to granulite facies. U–Pb isotope analyses of zircon yield secondary ages around 1790 Ma. These results are interpreted as the age of metamorphism and indicate a reactivation of the northeastern margin of the Superior Province during a Paleoproterozoic tectono-metamorphic event, resulting from probable continental collision. (Madore, 2001). Pingualuit impact crater is located on the peninsula.

== Fauna ==
The Ungava brown bear, an extinct population of the grizzly bear, is named after this peninsula.

== Climate ==
The climate is extremely cold (&quot;Dfc&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) because the Labrador Current keeps the region (and all of northern Québec) colder in the summer than other regions at comparable latitudes:

<text>Uber Technologies, Inc. is an American multinational transportation company that provides ride-hailing services, courier services, food delivery, and freight transport. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and operates in approximately 70 countries and 15,000 cities worldwide. It is the largest ridesharing company worldwide with over 150 million monthly active users and 6 million active drivers and couriers. It coordinates an average of 28 million trips per day, and has coordinated 47 billion trips since its inception in 2010. In 2023, the company had a take rate (revenue as a percentage of gross bookings) of 28.7% for mobility services and 18.3% for food delivery.

== History ==

In 2009, Garrett Camp, a co-founder of StumbleUpon, came up with the idea to create Uber to make it easier and cheaper to procure direct transportation. Camp and Travis Kalanick had spent $800 hiring a private driver on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which they deemed excessive, and Camp was also inspired by his difficulty in finding a taxi on a snowy night in Paris. The prototype of the mobile app was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick as the &quot;mega advisor&quot; to the company.

In February 2010, Ryan Graves became the first Uber employee; he was named chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2010. In December 2010, Kalanick succeeded Graves as CEO and Graves became the chief operating officer.

Following a beta launch in May 2010, Uber&#x27;s services and mobile app launched publicly in San Francisco in 2011. Originally, the application only allowed users to hail a black luxury car and the price was approximately 1.5 times that of a taxi. In 2011, the company changed its name from &quot;UberCab&quot; to &quot;Uber&quot; after complaints from San Francisco taxicab operators. Kalanick believed that in addition to efficiency, Uber offered elegance because all drivers had fancy black cars. He did not feel that regular cars would be attractive.

The company&#x27;s early hires included a nuclear physicist, a computational neuroscientist, and a machinery expert who worked on predicting arrival times for Uber&#x27;s cars more accurately than Google APIs. In April 2012, Uber launched a service in Chicago, whereby users were able to request a regular taxi or an Uber driver via its mobile app.

When Wingz, Inc. launched in 2011 with the first ridesharing website in the world using regular drivers, Kalanick felt that Wingz was illegal and contacted authorities to stop regular drivers from giving rides.
In April 2013, after Wingz, Inc. fought to become legal and obtain the first legal ridesharing license in the world, Uber copied this model and added regular drivers with personal vehicles to the UberX platform instead of only commercially-licensed vehicles, but subject to a background check, insurance, registration, and vehicle standards. In July 2012, Uber had introduced UberX, a cheaper option that allowed drivers to use non-luxury vehicles, but still subject to having a California Public Utilities commercial license. By December 2013, the service was operating in 65 cities.

In December 2013, &quot;USA Today&quot; named Uber its tech company of the year.

In August 2014, Uber launched a shared transport service in the San Francisco Bay Area and launched Uber Eats, a food delivery service.
In August 2016, facing tough competition, Uber sold its operations in China to DiDi in exchange for an 18% stake in DiDi. DiDi agreed to invest $1 billion in Uber. Uber had started operations in China in 2014, under the name 优步 (Yōubù).

In 2016, Uber acquired Ottomotto, a self-driving truck company founded by Anthony Levandowski, for $625 million. Levandowski, previously employed by Waymo, allegedly founded Ottomotto using trade secrets he stole from Waymo. Uber settled a lawsuit regarding the use of such intellectual property and reached a deal to use Waymo&#x27;s technology for its freight transport operations.

In December 2016, Uber acquired Geometric Intelligence. Geometric Intelligence&#x27;s 15 person staff formed the initial core of &quot;Uber AI&quot;, a division for researching AI technologies and machine learning. Uber AI created multiple open source projects, such as Pyro, Ludwig, and Plato. Uber AI also developed new AI techniques and algorithms, such as the POET algorithm and a sequence of papers on neuroevolution. Uber AI was shut down in May 2020.

In August 2017, Dara Khosrowshahi, the former CEO of Expedia Group, replaced Kalanick as CEO. Earlier in March 2015, as CEO of Expedia Group, Khosrowshahi had led a multimillion equity investment in Wingz, Inc., the first ridesharing company in the world.

In February 2018, Uber combined its operations in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan with those of Yandex Taxi and invested $225 million in the venture. In March 2018, Uber merged its services in Southeast Asia with those of Grab in exchange for a 27.5% ownership stake in Grab.

Between May 2018 and November 2018, Uber offered Uber Rent powered by Getaround, a peer-to-peer carsharing service available to some users in San Francisco.

In November 2018, Uber became a gold member of the Linux Foundation.

In 2018, Uber formed a partnership with Autzu, a San Francisco-based ridesharing company. This collaboration provides Uber drivers with the opportunity to rent electric Tesla on an hourly basis.

On May 10, 2019, Uber became a public company via an initial public offering.

In the summer of 2019, Uber announced layoffs of 8% of its staff and eliminated the position of COO Barney Harford.

In October 2019, Uber acquired 53% of Cornershop, a provider of grocery delivery services primarily in Latin America. In June 2021, it acquired the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop for 29 million shares of Uber.

Between October 2019 and May 2020, Uber offered Uber Works, a mobile app connecting workers who wanted temporary jobs with businesses in Chicago and Miami.

In January 2020, Uber acquired Careem for $3.1 billion and sold its Indian Uber Eats operations to Zomato.

Also in January 2020, Uber tested a feature that enabled drivers at the Santa Barbara, Sacramento, and Palm Springs airports to set fares based on a multiple of Uber&#x27;s rates.

In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Uber announced layoffs of over 14% of its workforce.

In June 2020, in its first software as a service partnership, Uber announced that it would manage the on-demand high-occupancy vehicle fleet for Marin Transit, a public bus agency in Marin County, California.

In September 2020, Uber committed to carbon neutrality globally by 2040, and required that, by 2030, in most countries, rides must be offered exclusively in electric vehicles.

In December 2020, Uber acquired Postmates for $2.65 billion.

Also in December 2020, Uber sold its Elevate division, which was developing short flights using VTOL aircraft, to Joby Aviation.

In January 2021, Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), a joint venture minority-owned by SoftBank Vision Fund, Toyota, and Denso that was developing self-driving cars, was sold to Aurora Innovation for $4 billion in equity and Uber invested $400 million into Aurora.

In March 2021, the company moved to a new headquarters on Third Street in Mission Bay, San Francisco, consisting of several 6- and 11-story buildings connected by bridges and walkways.

In October 2021, Uber acquired Drizly, an alcohol delivery service, for $1.1 billion in cash and stock; it was shut down in early 2024.

On January 20, 2022, Uber acquired Australian car-sharing company Car Next Door.
On September 15, 2022, Uber discovered a security breach of its internal network by a hacker that utilized social engineering to obtain an employee&#x27;s credentials and gain access to the company&#x27;s VPN and intranet. The company said that no sensitive data had been compromised.

== Controversies ==

Uber classifies its drivers as gig workers or independent contractors, which has drawn criticism and legal challenges because it allows the company to withhold worker protections that it would have been required to provide to employees.
This figure has disrupted taxicab businesses, and has become the subject of legal action in several jurisdictions.
Ridesharing companies are regulated in many jurisdictions and the Uber platform is not available in several countries where the company is not able or willing to comply with local regulations. 

In addition, studies have shown that, especially in cities where it competes with public transport, Uber contributes to an increase in traffic congestion, reduces public transport use, has no substantial impact on vehicle ownership, and increases automobile dependency.

Other controversies involving Uber include various unethical practices such as aggressive lobbying and ignoring/evading local regulations. Some of these conducts were revealed by a leak of documents showing controversial activity between 2013 and 2017 under the leadership of Travis Kalanick.

=== Ignoring and evading local regulations ===
Uber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is &quot;a technology company&quot; and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber&#x27;s strategy was generally to &quot;seek forgiveness rather than permission&quot;. In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber&#x27;s response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy.

More than 124,000 Uber documents covering the five-year period from 2012 to 2017 when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick were leaked by Mark MacGann, a lobbyist who &quot;led Uber&#x27;s efforts to win over governments across Europe, the Middle East and Africa&quot;, to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and first printed on 10 July 2022 by its Sunday sister &quot;The Observer&quot;. The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden, Olaf Scholz and George Osborne; how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France, and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data. Travis Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s worth it, violence guarantees success&quot;.

Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber&#x27;s policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial.

In March 2017, an investigation by &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that Uber developed a software tool called &quot;Greyball&quot; to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber&#x27;s private hire operator licence in September 2017. A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a &quot;panic button&quot; system, codenamed &quot;Ripley&quot;, that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016.

=== Traffic congestion ===
=== Counter-intelligence research on class action plaintiffs ===
In 2016, Uber hired the global security consulting firm Ergo to secretly investigate plaintiffs involved in a class action lawsuit. Ergo operatives posed as acquaintances of the plaintiff&#x27;s counsel and tried to contact their associates to obtain information that could be used against them. The result of which was found out causing the judge to throw out evidence obtained as obtained in a fraudulent manner.

=== Sexual harassment allegations and management shakeup (2017) ===
On February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was allegedly aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber&#x27;s Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber&#x27;s board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to &quot;dig up dirt&quot; on the personal lives and backgrounds of journalists who reported negatively on Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.

=== Delayed disclosure of data breaches ===
On February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.

An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers&#x27; license information. Hackers used employees&#x27; usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a &quot;credential stuffing&quot; method) to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber&#x27;s developers. The hackers located credentials for the company&#x27;s Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data. Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach. Dara Khosrowshahi publicly apologized. In September 2018, in the largest multi-state settlement of a data breach, Uber paid $148 million to the Federal Trade Commission, and admitted that internal access to consumers&#x27; personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false, and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data. In November 2018, Uber&#x27;s British divisions were fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office.

In 2020, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against former Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan for obstruction of justice. The criminal complaint said Joe Sullivan arranged with Travis Kalanick&#x27;s knowledge, to pay a ransom for the 2016 breach as a &quot;bug bounty&quot; to conceal its true nature, and for the hackers to falsify non-disclosure agreements to say they had not obtained any data.

=== Privacy ===
In July 2017, Uber received a five-star privacy rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, but was harshly criticized by the group in September 2017 for a controversial policy of tracking customers&#x27; locations even after a ride ended, forcing the company to reverse its policy.

In January 2024, Uber was fined 10 million euros ($11 million) by the Dutch Data Protection Authority for violating privacy regulations pertaining to the personal data of its drivers. The authority determined that Uber had failed to provide clear information in its terms and conditions regarding the duration for which it retained drivers&#x27; personal data, as well as the measures taken to secure this data when transmitting it to undisclosed entities outside the European Economic Area.

In August 2024, Uber was fined €290m euros ($324 million) by the Dutch Data Protection Authority for transferring the personal data of European drivers to US servers in breach of the GDPR.

=== Labor ===
In February 2023, Uber drivers went on strike in the US and UK to protest wages and fees. They were joined by drivers from Lyft and DoorDash delivery workers.

=== Ads and promotions ===
In March 2024, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported a trend of popular service apps like Uber emphasizing higher margin advertising to increase profits. The reporting mentioned Uber personalizing content based on user data and maintain the balance between increasing ad revenue and annoying and turning away customers. It noted that Uber was showing customers one ad per trip and how it tried to implement push alerts before moving away from them given the response from customers.

=== Passenger Safety and Sexual Assault Lawsuits (2024) ===
In February 2024, a multidistrict litigation (MDL) was established in the Northern District of California against Uber Technologies, Inc., consolidating numerous claims from among the more than 3,000 sexual assault lawsuits filed against the company in state and federal courts. These lawsuits allege Uber prioritized growth over safety by using inadequate background checks, skipping in-person driver vetting, and failing to invest in preventive measures such as cameras or monitoring systems. It also claims Uber knowingly put vulnerable passengers, such as intoxicated women, at risk through its marketing and business practices. The litigation seeks injunctive relief, damages and changes to Uber&#x27;s safety policies. Some survivors have chosen to pursue justice in state courts outside of the MDL, seeking faster resolutions and a more individualized approach.

== Finances ==

Uber has posted hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in losses each year from 2014 until 2022 except for 2018, when it exited from the markets in Russia, China, and Southeast Asia in exchange for stakes in rival businesses. By the end of 2022, Uber had US$32.11 billion in assets and $24.03 billion in liabilities. Uber posted annual operating profits in 2023, totaling $1.88 billion, after accumulating $31.5 billion in operating losses since 2014.

<doc id="722463" wikidata="Q1896712" url="?curid=722463" title="Mariana Bracetti">
<text>Mariana Bracetti Cuevas (also spelled Bracety) (July 26, 1825 – February 25, 1903) was a patriot and leader of the Puerto Rico independence movement. In 1868, she knitted the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; flag that was intended to be used as the national emblem of Puerto Rico in its first of two attempts to overthrow Spanish rule, and to establish the island as a sovereign republic. As the flag of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; revolt, Bracetti&#x27;s creation became known as the &quot;Bandera del Grito de Lares (Grito de Lares flag)&quot;, most commonly known as the &quot;Bandera de Lares (Lares flag)&quot;. Today, the flag is the official flag of the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Bracetti, born in the city of Añasco, Puerto Rico, met and developed a romantic relationship with Miguel Rojas Luzardo, a rich Venezuelan businessman visiting Añasco. Rojas and his brother Manuel owned a coffee plantation called &quot;El Triunfo&quot; near Lares. Miguel and Manuel Rojas were admirers of Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and were influenced by his ideals of independence for and beyond Puerto Rico. Bracetti married Rojas with whom she had children.

==The first independence movement flag of Puerto Rico==
Bracetti then moved to the hacienda &quot;El Triunfo&quot;, which was to become the clandestine nucleus of the revolution that would be known as El Grito de Lares. The Rojas&#x27; admiration for Betances led them to join him in the conspiracy to rebel against, and gain independence from, Spain.

The Rojas brothers became the independence leaders in Lares and their code name was &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; (Bravo Center). Manuel Rojas, Bracetti&#x27;s brother-in-law, was named Commander of the Liberation Army. Mathias Brugman was the independence leader in Mayagüez and his group went by the code name of &quot;Capa Prieto&quot; (Dark Cape).

Bracetti&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Brazo de Oro&quot; (Golden Arm) and she was appointed the leader of the &quot;Lares&#x27;s Revolutionary Council.&quot; Betances suggested that Bracetti knit the first flag (modeled on the Dominican Republic&#x27;s flag) of the future &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico.&quot; With the materials provided by Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances, Bracetti designed and knitted the flag taking into consideration Betances&#x27;s suggestions. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners are red and the two upper corners are blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross on the Revolutionary Flag of Lares stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.

==El Grito de Lares==
On the morning of September 23, 1868, an Army of about 800 men met in the &quot;El Triunfo&quot; plantation and Manuel Rojas proceeded to take the town of Lares, which initiated the revolution known as &quot;El Grito de Lares.&quot; Once the town was taken, Bracetti&#x27;s flag was placed on the High Altar of the Parroquial Church. The revolutionists declared Puerto Rico a republic, swore in Francisco Ramírez Medina as its first president and celebrated a speedy mass.

The rebel forces then departed to take over the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino. The Spanish militia, however, surprised the group with strong resistance, causing great confusion among the armed rebels who, led by Manuel Rojas, retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Julián Pavía, the Spanish militia soon rounded up the rebels. All of the survivors, including Bracetti, were imprisoned in Arecibo and the insurrection was quickly brought to an end. The original Lares flag was taken by a Spanish army officer as a war prize and many years later returned to the Puerto Rican people. It is now exhibited in the University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Museum. Eighty of the prisoners died in jail, Bracetti however, lived and was released on January 20, 1869, when the new Spanish Republican government granted them general amnesty. Mariana Bracetti died in the municipality of Añasco, Puerto Rico in 1903 and was buried in the Plaza of Añasco. There is a monument honoring her on the spot where she is buried.

==Legacy==
Juan de Mata Terreforte, a revolutionist who fought alongside Manuel Rojas in the Grito de Lares, and who was the Vice-President of Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, a Chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York City, adopted Bracetti&#x27;s &quot;Flag of Lares&quot; as the flag which represented Puerto Rico. It became their standard until 1892 when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee.

Bracetti was the principal subject of two books: &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot; by Luis Lloréns Torres, and &quot;Brazo de Oro&quot; by Cesáreo Rosa-Nieves. Her memory has been honored in Puerto Rico and elsewhere with schools, streets and avenues named after her. In Lares, there is a Mariana Bracetti Museum and in Philadelphia there is a Mariana Bracetti Academy Charter School. The Mariana Bracetti Plaza and public housing development in New York City was also named after her. The public housing development built and maintained by the New York City Housing Authority in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side.

<doc id="722467" wikidata="Q1046742" url="?curid=722467" title="Comiket">
<text>, more commonly known as or , is a semiannual &quot;doujinshi&quot; convention in Tokyo, Japan. A grassroots market focused on the sale of &quot;doujin&quot; (self-published) works, Comiket is a not-for-profit fan convention administered by the volunteer-run Comic Market Preparatory Committee (ComiketPC). Inaugurated on 21 December 1975 with an estimated 700 attendees, Comiket has since grown to become the largest fan convention in the world, with an estimated turnstile attendance of 750,000 in 2019. Comiket is typically held at Tokyo Big Sight in August and December, with the two events distinguished as and , respectively.

==Program==
===&quot;Doujin&quot; marketplace===
Comiket is focused primarily on the sale of &quot;doujin&quot;: non-commercial, self-published works. Approximately 35,000 circles (a term for groups or individuals who create &quot;doujin&quot;) participate in each edition of Comiket. Different circles exhibit on each day of Comiket; circles producing works on a common subject, such as a particular media franchise or manga genre, are typically grouped on the same day. The most common item sold at Comiket is &quot;doujinshi&quot; (self-published comics, novels or magazines), while a smaller number of circles sell doujin soft, analog (board/card/etc.) games, music, clothing, and other goods. These are often derivative fan works based on anime, video games, and other media, legal according to Japanese law (shinkokuzai). Since Comiket&#x27;s inauguration, sample copies of all works sold at Comiket are collected and archived by ComiketPC, with over 2.1 million works having been archived.

====Trends in derivative works====
===Cosplay===

Comiket is a major outlet for cosplay enthusiasts. Since Comiket 80 in 2011, restrictions on cosplaying have been gradually relaxed, with a shift from regulating objects (e.g. a ban on items that could be used as weapons) to regulating behavior (e.g. a ban on swinging around long objects). Some general contemporary guidelines include not wearing clothes that are too revealing, not imitating uniformed officers, and being out of cosplay when arriving/departing from Comiket.

===Corporate booths===
Comiket hosts 190 corporate booths each year. This includes both large commercial companies, such as video game studios and manga publishers, as well as celebrity meet and greet sessions.

==Operations==
===Schedule===

Comiket is held twice yearly, in August and December. These events are distinguished as &quot;Summer Comic Market&quot; (&quot;Natsukomi&quot;) and &quot;Winter Comic Market&quot; (&quot;Fuyukomi&quot;). Since 1995, both events have run for three days each, with Summer Comiket generally occurring Friday to Sunday in mid-August, and Winter Comiket generally occurring the three days prior to New Year&#x27;s Day. Starting with Comiket 96, the events have been four days long, with the exception of Comiket 103 and 104, which, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were reduced to two days each. Both events run daily from 10:00a.m. to 4:00p.m, with corporate booths open until 5:00p.m and the entire convention closing an hour early on the final day of the event. Comiket has been held at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, Tokyo since 1996. Comiket 98, which was planned for August 2020, was the event&#x27;s first cancellation in its history as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; Comiket 99, which would have been held in December 2020 was instead held in December 2021, two years after the last time it was held, and ran for only two days.

===Event size===

Comiket is the largest fan convention in the world, growing from fewer than 10,000 attendees in 1982 to over half a million by 2004. Since 2007, attendee numbers have fluctuated in the region of 500,000 for Winter Comiket and 560,000 for Summer Comiket. Because of the extremely high volume of attendance at Comiket, mobile phone companies set up temporary antennas, while the Tokyo Metro makes special arrangements to accommodate the large crowds. Hour-long queues to enter Comiket during peak hours are common, while some attendees queue up to five hours before the event to ensure early admission. Popular circles are frequently placed near the venue&#x27;s loading docks so that their queues can extend outside. ComiketPC recommends that first-time attendees arrive in the afternoon to avoid queues.

===Catalog===
For every Comiket, a catalog is released that contains information about the event. The catalog includes a list of all participating circles, maps of the convention layout, directions to and from the convention, rules for the convention, results from surveys held among Comiket participants, articles about topics relevant to &quot;dōjinshi&quot; creators, and one to two pictures (&quot;circle cuts&quot;) for every participating circle. It is available in print and DVD-ROM format, and since Comiket 83, is available online behind a partial paywall.

Catalogs are made available for sale at stores two weeks before the event. The print version is roughly the size of an average phone book, while the DVD-ROM version includes features such as advanced search functions and a clickable map. To date, there is no English edition of the catalog available, though the catalog does contain a four-page basic guide for attending Comiket in English, Chinese, and Korean.

Prior to Comiket 96, a purchased catalog was not required for admission to Comiket (see 2020 Summer Olympics changes below).

===Participants===
The overwhelming majority of Comiket circle participants are amateur and hobbyist artists: 70% of participating circles lose money, while only 15% turn a profit. The majority of circle participants at Comiket are female, with women composing 57% of participating circles at Comiket 84. General attendees at Comiket tend to skew male, with men comprising 64% of attendees at Comiket 78.

Of the Comiket circle participants, a 2011 poll showed that nearly half participated because attending the event and showing off their work is enjoyable, and a significant percentage came to spread their works to the public. A smaller percentage of dōjinshi creators&#x27; goal is to promote an idea or opinion through attending Comiket.

The majority of those participating in circles in 2010 said that they are a part of a one-person circle (59%), while two-person (20%) and three-person (8%) circles were also common.

===Philanthropy===
Since 1993, ComiketPC has donated over ¥60 million to sustainable forest management to offset paper used in the production of dōjinshi. Since 2007, ComiketPC has worked with the Japanese Red Cross Society to organize bloodmobiles at Comiket events, with donors given Comiket-exclusive posters depicting characters from anime and video games. The Red Cross receives an estimated 1,500 blood donations at each Comiket.

==History==

Comiket was inaugurated in 1975 by (Labyrinth), a &quot;dōjin&quot; circle founded by Yoshihiro Yonezawa, , and while studying at Meiji University. The first Comiket was organized amid a period of immense change and upheaval for manga as a medium, characterized by the closure of the experimental manga magazine &quot;COM&quot; and the ascendance of the Year 24 Group. A 1975 incident in which a &quot;dōjin&quot; creator applying for was refused admission after criticizing the convention&#x27;s focus on professional guests over &quot;dōjin&quot; creators in her application became a catalyst for the founding of Comiket as a fan convention.

As Comiket grew, a lottery system to allocate exhibition space was implemented in 1979, as the number of applications from circles began to surpass available space. In 1981 the event moved to and began publishing an event catalog in 1982. Comiket would change locations frequently throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, as the Japanese bubble economy led to an upsurge in trade shows that made it difficult to secure a consistent venue. The murders by Tsutomu Miyazaki and subsequent moral panic against otaku would lead to further difficulties in Comiket&#x27;s ability to secure a venue. Tokyo Big Sight hosted Comiket for the first time in 1996, and remains the convention&#x27;s primary venue. In 1998 (C54), an arsonist placed incendiary devices in the venue the day before the event, which were noticed and neutralized with no major damage; the event was held as normal, though with heightened security. The arsonist was caught at the following event.

In 2012, anonymous threats made against circles creating works related to &quot;Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball&quot; led Comiket to prohibit the sale of all &quot;Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball&quot;-related items at Comiket 85 (see Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball § Controversies). Organizers refunded the registration fees for the roughly 900 circles producing &quot;Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball&quot; items, resulting in a loss for Comiket of roughly ¥10 million. In 2015, ComiketPC organized a special event specifically focused on doujinshi related to the series. Affectionately nicknamed &quot;Kuroket&quot;, the event hosted approximately 2,400 circles producing &quot;Kuroko&#x27;s Basketball&quot; items.
In August 2018, ComiketPC announced modified schedules for Comikets 96, 97, and 98 due to the 2020 Summer Olympics. As the east wing of Big Sight closed in 2019 for renovations in advance of the Olympics, the corporate booths of C96 and C97 were moved to Aomi Exhibition Hall, and both events expanded to four days of programming. Admission to both events required the purchase of a wristband – the first time in Comiket&#x27;s history it was not free to attend – in order to offset the cost of running the event across four days, and to depress attendance in light of the smaller venue space. Wristbands for all four days were included with the purchase of a print event catalog, while individual wristbands for each day were available to purchase at Big Sight the day of the event. C98 in 2020 was slated to be moved to Golden Week in May in order to not conflict with the Olympics in August. On 27 March 2020, ComiketPC announced that C98 had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the first time a Comiket event has been cancelled. On 12 July 2020, it was announced that Comiket 99 would be postponed to 2021, taking place during Golden Week as C98 would have in order to not conflict with the Summer Olympics, which were also postponed. A virtual event titled &quot;Air Comiket&quot; was held in December to replace its originally planned dates. Comic Market 99 was ultimately delayed to December 2021, and ran for only two days with entry limited to 55,000 people per day by requiring ticket purchases.

<doc id="722469" wikidata="Q2706945" url="?curid=722469" title="Night Songs (Cinderella album)">
<text>Night Songs is the debut studio album by American glam metal band Cinderella. It was released on June 9, 1986, by Mercury Records. Mercury issued the album worldwide, while Vertigo Records handled the album&#x27;s release in the UK.

The album peaked at No. 3 on the US charts on February 7, 1987, and was certified double platinum for shipping 2 million copies there twelve days later. In May 1991, it was certified triple platinum, having shipped 3 million copies.

Leadoff single &quot;Shake Me&quot; failed to chart, but &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; cracked the Top 20, reaching No. 13. Third single &quot;Somebody Save Me&quot; went to #66. On May 4, 1987, Cinderella filmed parts of their concert in Philadelphia. These live songs were, along with their three MTV videos, released on home video in August 1987 on &quot;Night Songs: The Videos&quot;.

&quot;Night Songs&quot; sold several million copies due to a combination of Cinderella&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, MTV airplay, and an opening slot on labelmates Bon Jovi&#x27;s tour, in support of their album &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed reviews. David Fricke, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, considered that &quot;[Cinderella] need to jazz up their material and cut away the clichés if they&#x27;re really interested in hard-rock immortality. Otherwise, their platinum dreams are going to turn into pumpkins&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey called it &quot;not bad, just generic&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff put on a par Cinderella&#x27;s rise to prominence with Poison&#x27;s success, judging them as &quot;little more than vacant, colourful but life-affirming [Mötley] Crüe derivatives.&quot; He described the songs as &quot;heavier than one might expect, but of course safe, shallow and watery like the kiddie pool.&quot;

The album has been retrospectively considered a hair-metal classic, being ranked on a vast amount of &quot;best of&quot; lists.

==Artwork==

The album cover was photographed by Mark Weiss at the Head House in the New Market and Head House district in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
After the release of this album, the band slightly changed their sound to fit a more blues rock direction. In October 2014 for her birthday, guitarist Tom Keifer presented Lzzy Hale of Halestorm with the costume jewelry pin he wore on his right shoulder for the &quot;Night Songs&quot; album cover. Hale subsequently wore the pin on her right hip on the album cover for Halestorm&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Into the Wild Life&quot;, to include a touch of tradition.

<doc id="722475" wikidata="Q1687449" url="?curid=722475" title="Jensen FF">
<text>The Jensen FF is a four-wheel drive grand tourer produced by British car manufacturer Jensen Motors between 1966 and 1971. It was the first non all-terrain production car equipped with four-wheel drive and an anti-lock braking system. The powertrain was sourced from Chrysler, installing the second generation V8 engine and 3-speed &quot;TorqueFlite A727&quot; automatic transmission.

The use of four-wheel drive in a passenger car preceded the successful AMC Eagle by thirteen years, the Audi Quattro by fourteen years, and the Subaru Leone by five years. The Dunlop Maxaret mechanical anti-lock braking system had previously been used only on aircraft, lorries, and racing cars. An experimental version was first fitted to the earlier Jensen C-V8, but this did not go into production.

The letters FF stand for &quot;Ferguson Formula&quot;, after Ferguson Research Ltd., who invented the car&#x27;s four-wheel drive system. The FF is related to the similar-looking, rear-wheel drive Jensen Interceptor, but is longer, and mechanically very different.

Standard FF features included front seat belts, a tachometer, and map pockets.

==Reception and sales==
Although it was a highly innovative vehicle in a technical sense, the FF was not commercially successful. Its price was high — about 30% higher than the Jensen Interceptor, and more than that of luxury GTs from much more prestigious makers. In the UK a reputed 320 to 330 examples of the Jensen FF V8 model were made by Jensen Motors Limited according to The Jensen Owners Club.

The FF also suffered from a design problem, and not one easily cured: the system was set up for a driver in the right-hand seat, and no considerations had been made to making it left-hand drive. In particular, the central transfer case and both propeller shafts protruded into the left-hand seat space. The steering gear and brake servo were fitted on the right-hand side, and there was no space for them on the left. By the early 1970s, Jensen&#x27;s primary markets were in overseas markets where cars were driven on the right-hand side of the road. The FF could not be sold in the United States.

==Appearance==
The FF may be distinguished from the Interceptor by a few styling cues, the most obvious being the twin (rather than single) diagonal air vents on the front wing, just rear of the wheel-arches. The frontal appearance was revised in September 1968.

Only coupés were made; there were no convertibles.


==Derivatives==
One experimental Ferguson FF was built in 1968 with a 7-litre (426 cubic inch) Hemi engine imported from Chrysler in the U.S. Further Hemi engine equipped models were not built, due to the limits of the suspension at extremely high speeds, and the cost of importing the Hemi engine into Britain, which was deemed too great.

This version was equipped with a 7.2-litre (440 cubic inch) engine with a &quot;Six Pack&quot; induction system (three 2-barrel carburettors) as well as four-wheel drive. Less than ten are thought to have been built.

==Models==
Dinky Toys produced a die-cast model of the FF, available in both ready-constructed and kit form. Playart also produced a 1:64 scale FF, possibly scaled down from the Dinky model.

The Dinky car had opening doors and both the Playart and Dinky models featured an opening bonnet (hood).

<text>Berhanu Bayeh (; born October 5, 1935) is an Ethiopian former military officer and politician. He was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia during the Derg regime from 1986 to 1989. Prior to that, he was chairman of the Derg&#x27;s committee for legal affairs. Bayeh was a refugee resident of the Italian Embassy from May 1991 until December 2020, when he left the embassy.

==Biography==
Berhanu was born in Gojjam and was of Amhara descent. In 1959 he entered Harar Military Academy as a cadet, and upon graduation was posted to the airborne division in Nazret. Two years later he attended Haile Selassie University, where he studied law. In 1967 he became a lecturer at Harar Military Academy. He joined the Armed Forces Coordination Committee in 1974.

As a captain, Berhanu joined the Derg as the representative of the Military Academy, where he became chairman of the legal committee, and was promoted to Major in April 1976. In this new role, he toured a number of Arab countries in 1976 and stated they all supported the PMAC regime, although aid to Ethiopia from these counties ceased not long after. With Atnafu Abate, he managed to avoid the infamous Derg meeting of 3 February 1977, where a number of Derg leaders, including chairman Lieutenant General Tafari Benti, were killed in an ambush orchestrated by Mengistu Haile Mariam; the Ottaways assume that he &quot;had apparently sided with Mengistu.&quot; In late February 1977, he was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. At the beginning of the Ogaden War, when the Soviet Union attempted to mediate peace between Ethiopia and Somalia, Birhanu secretly met with a Somali delegation in Moscow. He led also the Ethiopian delegation that facilitated the exchange of Ethiopian and Somali prisoners of war in 1988.

On 19 April 1983 Mengistu appointed him Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and on 12 September 1984 he became a member of the Politburo of the Workers&#x27; Party of Ethiopia. On 26 October 1984, Berhanu was appointed chairman of the Aid Coordination Department of the Natural Disaster Relief Committee. He held periodic talks with Eritrean rebels that failed to accomplish much. He was named foreign minister in November 1986. In a cabinet reshuffle in October 1988, Berhanu was appointed president of the state council after Amanuel Andemikael defected to the United States.

Berhanu obtained safe haven in the Italian embassy after the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front army entered Addis Ababa on May 28, 1991. Also fleeing there were Tesfaye Gebre Kidan, the last acting president of the Derg/PDRE regime, Hailu Yimenu, the last acting prime minister, and chief of the general staff Adis Tedla. Hailu committed suicide later in 1991.

On 2 June 2004, Tesfaye died after a brawl. Prior to the brawl, Tesfaye had constantly accused Bayeh of being an enemy sympathizer, because Bayeh&#x27;s wife is of Eritrean descent. The death occurred after a physical brawl with Berhanu, when Tesfaye was accidentally hurt on his head from a glass cut and bled profusely. On 2 June 2004, he was taken to Menelik II Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Tesfaye&#x27;s death came almost 13 years after he and Berhanu fled into the embassy.

Although Berhamu and Adis&#x27; continued presence in the embassy was a considerable embarrassment, the Italian government refused to give them up for trial since Ethiopia still has the death penalty. They were sentenced to death in absentia in 2008, but President Sahle-Work Zewde commuted their sentences to life imprisonment on 19 December 2020. After Attorney General Gedion Timothewos requested that a federal court grant Berhanu and Adis leniency on account of old age, the court voted to grant them parole on 24 December.

<doc id="722484" wikidata="Q5433309" url="?curid=722484" title="Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993">
<text>The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is a United States labor law requiring covered employers to provide employees with job-protected, unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. The FMLA was a major part of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first-term domestic agenda, and he signed it into law on February 5, 1993. The FMLA is administered by the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.

The FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded or face certain limitations. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for their employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius. Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers.

==Background==

Before the 1992 presidential election, a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President George H. W. Bush. After Bill Clinton won the 1992 election, a law protecting family medical leave became one of his major first-term domestic priorities. Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a federal regulation that would support workers who wanted to raise a family and/or needed time off for illness-related situations. Clinton signed the bill into law on February 5, 1993 (codified under , , and ), with enforcement of the bill to start on August 5, 1993.

The United States Congress passed the Act with the understanding that &quot;it is important for the development of children and the family unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early childrearing ... [and] the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting.&quot; It also stressed the Act was intended to provide leave protection &quot;in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.&quot;

On December 20, 2019, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA) amended the FMLA to grant federal government employees up to 12 weeks of paid time off for the birth, adoption, or foster of a new child. The law applies to births or placements occurring on or after October 1, 2020.

==Contents==
===Scope of rights===
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year. An employee must have worked over 12 months and 1,250 hours in the last year (around 25 hours a week), and they must have worked at a work site where the total number of employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of that work site is at least 50. 

For employees with no fixed work site, their work site is considered to be the location where they are assigned as their &quot;home base&quot;, where their work is assigned, or where they report. A work site is never considered the employee&#x27;s home, even if they work from home; in these cases, their worksite is considered the location where they report and that assigns them work. Employees who are not employed in U.S. nor its territories are not counted. For educational institutions, teachers who are employed permanently or under contract are counted even when school is not in session. Work sites include public agencies, including schools and state, local, and federal employers. After a private employer meets the 50 employees in 20 workweeks threshold, the employer continues to be covered by FMLA until the employer no longer has employed 50 employees for 20 workweeks in both the current and the preceding calendar year. The 50-employee threshold does not apply to public agency employees or local educational agencies. There are special hours rules for certain airline employees.

The 75-mile radius is measured using the shortest route using surface roads or waterways. 

Employees must give employers 30 days&#x27; notice if birth or adoption is &quot;foreseeable&quot;, and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged &quot;so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer&quot; according to medical advice.

Along with the 30 days&#x27; notice, there are other requirements when seeking the FMLA rights. If an employee wants to leave the first time using their FMLA rights, they must first claim the Family and Medical Leave Act. In the case that an employee were to take FMLA leave again, the same process must proceed.

With the release of employees, there is also a certification. The absence of an employee due to the conditions they may have may require certification as proof of the verification of absence. To certify an employee&#x27;s leave, the employer may ask for other requirements, such as multiple medical opinions. All these prerequisites are at the employer&#x27;s expense. Certain additional rules may apply to employees of local education agencies.

In most of the United States, employers and employees cannot refuse the application of the FMLA to FMLA-qualifying absences. But since Escriba v. Foster Poultry Farms, Inc., 743 F.3d 1236, 1244 (9th Cir. 2014), in those states under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, an &quot;employee can affirmatively decline to use FMLA leave, even if the underlying reason for seeking the leave would have invoked FMLA protection.&quot;

===Rights during leave===
Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee&#x27;s own poor health. In full, the purposes for leave are:
* to care for a new child, whether for the birth, the adoption, or placement of a child in foster care;
* to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) (Note: Son/daughter has been clarified by the Department of Labor to mean a child under the age of 18 or a child over the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, which excludes, among other conditions, pregnancy and post-partum recovery from childbirth);
* to recover from a worker&#x27;s own serious health condition;
* to care for an injured service member in the family;
* to address qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member&#x27;s deployment; or
* twenty-six work weeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the servicemember&#x27;s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).

A serious health condition may be an illness, injury, impairment, physical condition, or mental condition that involves inpatient care or involves continuing treatment by a health care provider. A health condition is considered serious if it involves an overnight stay in a medical facility or if it requires continuing treatment by a health care provider. 

Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless an employer agrees otherwise. If a father and mother have the same employer, they must share their leave, in effect halving each person&#x27;s rights, if the employer so chooses.

Employers must continue to provide all employment benefits during the leave that the employee had accrued prior to the leave. Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide &quot;greater family or medical leave rights&quot;.

Since 2008, the Department of Labor has allowed the spouse, child, or parent of an active-duty military member who is deployed overseas for 12 or more months to take up to 12 weeks of leave. Also, a military caregiver provision was added that would allow a caregiver to take up to 26 weeks of leave in order to actively care for a military member who requires medical attention for acute or ongoing conditions.

===Substitute leave===
Under §2612(d)(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for &quot;accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave&quot; in an employer&#x27;s personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the US Supreme Court in &quot;Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc&quot; held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor&#x27;s job to enforce the law.

===Right to return to job===
After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to their job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal &quot;is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.&quot; In full, the rights during and after unpaid leave are to:
* the same group health insurance benefits, including employer contributions to premiums, that would exist if the employee were not on leave.
* restoration to the same position upon return to work. If the same position is unavailable, the employer must provide the worker with a position that is substantially equal in pay, benefits, and responsibility.
* protection of employee benefits while on leave. An employee is entitled to reinstatement of all benefits to which the employee was entitled before going on leave.
* protection of the employee to not have their rights under the Act interfered with or denied by an employer.
* protection of the employee from retaliation by an employer for exercising rights under the Act.
* intermittent FMLA leave for their own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of a family member. This includes occasional leave for doctors&#x27; appointments for a chronic condition, treatment (e.g., physical therapy, psychological counseling, chemotherapy), or temporary periods of incapacity (e.g., severe morning sickness, asthma attack).

&quot;Highly compensated employees&quot; have limited rights to return to their jobs. They are defined as &quot;a salaried eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the facility at which the employee is employed.&quot; Their employers are not required to restore them to their original position (or an equivalent position with equivalent pay and benefits, as is guaranteed to other employees) if the employer determines that denying the employee their position is &quot;necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer&quot; and the employer provides the worker with notice of this decision, though no time frame for providing this notice is established.

===Enforcement===
Employees or the Secretary of Labor can bring enforcement actions, but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law. There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations.

===Non-eligible workers and types of leave===
The federal FMLA does not apply to:
* workers in businesses with fewer than 50 employees (this threshold does not apply to public agency employers and local educational agencies as they are covered employers by name but there still must be at least 50 employees with a 75-mile radius for the employee to be eligible for FMLA leave);
* part-time workers who have worked fewer than 1,250 hours within the 12 months preceding the leave and a paid vacation;
* workers who need time off to care for seriously ill elderly relatives (other than parents), unless the relative was acting &quot;in loco parentis&quot; at the time the worker turned 18;
* workers who need time off to recover from short-term or common illness like a cold, or to care for a family member with a short-term illness;
* elected officials;
* workers who need time off for routine medical care, such as check-ups; and
* workers who need time off to care for pets.

==State family leave==
Some states have enacted laws that mandate additional family and medical leave for workers in a variety of ways. By 2017 five states and DC had laws for paid family leave: California since 2002, New Jersey since 2008, Rhode Island since 2013, New York since 2016, and the District of Columbia since 2019. Washington state passed a paid family and medical leave law in 2007. In 2015 Governor Jay Inslee secured a federal grant to begin designing a paid family leave program. The Washington State Legislature approved Senate Bill 5975 during the 2017 legislative session and the new law went into effect on October 19, 2017.

===Dropping the employer threshold===
The federal FMLA only applies to employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles. Some states have enacted their own FMLAs that have a lower threshold for employer coverage:
* Maine: 15 or more employees (private employers) and 25 or more (state or municipal employers).
* Maryland: 15 or more employees (private employers): up to seven days for bone marrow donation, 30 days for organ donation.
* Minnesota: 21 or more employees (parental leave only).
* Oregon: 25 or more employees. An employee must have worked at least 180 days, and averaged 25 hours per week at the time medical leave is requested
* Rhode Island: 50 or more employees (private employers) and 30 or more employees (public employers).
* Vermont: 10 or more employees (parental leave only) and 15 or more employees (family and medical leave).
* Washington: 50 or more employees (FMLA reasons besides insured parental leave); all employers are required to provide insured parental leave.
* District of Columbia: 20 or more employees.

===Expanded coverage===

The federal FMLA only applies to immediate family—parent, spouse, and child. The 2008 amendments to the FMLA for military family members extend the FMLA&#x27;s protection to next of kin and to adult children. The Department of Labor on June 22, 2010, clarified the definition of &quot;son and daughter&quot; under the FMLA &quot;to ensure that an employee who assumes the role of caring for a child receives parental rights to family leave regardless of the legal or biological relationship&quot; and specifying that &quot;an employee who intends to share in the parenting of a child with their same sex partner will be able to exercise the right to FMLA leave to bond with that child.&quot;

In February 2015, the Department of Labor issued its final rule (effective March 27, 2015) amending the definition of spouse under the FMLA in response to the 2013 decision in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;. The revised definition of &quot;spouse&quot; extends FMLA leave rights and job protections to eligible employees in a same-sex marriage or a common-law marriage entered into in a state where those statuses are legally recognized, regardless of the state in which the employee works or resides. Even if an employee works where same-sex or common law marriage is not recognized, that employee&#x27;s spouse triggers FMLA coverage if the employee married in a state that recognized same-sex marriage or common law marriage. Some states had already expanded the definition of family in their own FMLAs:
* California: Domestic partner and domestic partner&#x27;s child.
* Connecticut: Civil union partner, parent-in-law.
* Hawaii: Grandparent, parent-in-law, grandparent-in-law or an employee&#x27;s reciprocal beneficiary.
* Maine: Domestic partner and domestic partner&#x27;s child, siblings.
* Maryland: Allows the employee to use time for immediate family under the same rules if taking it for themselves. Includes step, adopted and even people who were primary caregivers even if not related.
* New Jersey: Civil union partner and child of civil union partner, parent-in-law, step parent.
* Oregon: Domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild or parent-in-law.
* Rhode Island: Domestic partners of state employees, parent-in-law.
* Vermont: Civil union partner, parent-in-law.
* Wisconsin: Parent-in-law.
* District of Columbia: Related to the worker by blood, legal custody, or marriage; person with whom the employee lives and has a committed relationship; child who lives with employee and for whom employee permanently assumes and discharges parental responsibility.
In June 2015, &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; required states to perform and recognize same-sex marriages. This eliminated the need for FMLA to distinguish which states perform and recognize same-sex marriage.

===Increasing the uses for FMLA leave===
FMLA leave can be used for a worker&#x27;s serious health condition, the serious health condition of a family member, or upon the arrival of a new child. State FMLA laws and the new military family provisions of the FMLA have broadened these categories:
* Connecticut: Organ or bone marrow donor.
* Maine: Organ donor; death of employee&#x27;s family member if that family member is a servicemember killed while on active duty.
* Maryland: Maryland Family Leave Act (MFLA) – Organ donor, Person Standing in Loco Parentis, For Service Leave, and added a specific anti-retaliation penalty on top of FMLA recovery. Runs parallel to FMLA.
* Oregon: Care for the non-serious injury or illness of a child requiring home care.

===Unpaid leave for other related purposes===
Several states have passed FMLA-type statutes to give parents unpaid leave for other related purposes, including:
* Attending child&#x27;s school or educational activities. Examples include California, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, and others. 
* Taking family members to routine medical visits. Massachusetts and Vermont. 
* Addressing the effects of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault. Examples include Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, and Illinois.

==Significance==
In 2003, Han and Waldfogel found that &quot;only about 60% of private sector workers are covered&quot; due to the clause stipulating a minimum number of employees, and once the clause stipulating a minimum number of hours worked is added, only 46% of private sector workers are eligible for leave under the FMLA. In June 2007, the Department of Labor&#x27;s Employment Standards Administration estimated that of 141.7 million workers in the United States, 94.4 million worked at FMLA-covered worksites, and 76.1 million were eligible for FMLA leave. Only eight to 17.1 percent of covered, eligible workers (or between 6.1 million and 13.0 million workers) took FMLA leave in 2005. The 2008 National Survey of Employers found no statistically significant difference between the proportion of small employers (79%) and large employers (82%) that offer full FMLA coverage. A 2012 Department of Labor study which was assisted through workplace surveys found that &quot;employees&#x27; use of leave, and employers&#x27; granting and administration of leave, have achieved a level of stability. Employees actively make use of the intended benefits
established by the Act, but appear to have limited knowledge of what the Act specifically entails and
covers. At the same time, most employers report that complying with the FMLA imposes minimal
burden on their operations, although a subset of employers reported difficulty complying.&quot;

Although much of the research has been conducted on populations in other countries, Berger et al. found that children in the United States whose mothers return to work within the first 3 months after giving birth are less likely to be breastfed, have all of their immunizations up to date (by 18 months), and receive all of their regular medical checkups; they are also more likely to exhibit behavioral problems by four years of age. Chatterji and Markowitz also found an association between longer lengths of maternity leave and lesser incidence of depression among mothers.

In spite of the FMLA&#x27;s lack of requirements to provide paid leave, the 2012 Department of Labor study found that by that point in time, most employees who were surveyed reported receiving some sort of paid leave, with 48% reported as receiving full pay and another 17% receive
partial pay, usually but not exclusively through regular paid vacation leave, sick leave, or other &quot;paid
time off&quot; hours. However, despite the FMLA&#x27;s expansion of rights to take leave, it did guarantee a right to free child care or day care at the federal level. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsidize parents&#x27; costs.

==Controversy==
The act was controversial at its passage. Much of the controversy focused on its impact on the business community, and on whether the law should be gender neutral or not. 
In order to make the law more acceptable, it was argued that the law would reduce abortions. Proponents of the law focused on its benefit to men and children, in order to counter the claim that it was giving women &quot;special treatment.&quot; Other controversies focused on whether the leave should be paid or not.

The law was finally approved, mandating unpaid gender-neutral leave; nevertheless it was still criticized.
Critics of the act have suggested that by mandating various forms of leave that are used more often by female than male employees, the Act, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, makes women more expensive to employ than men. They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than pregnancy discrimination against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman&#x27;s option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work ei. Employers Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave. However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.

Moreover, the FMLA is much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. This illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.

Additionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female&#x27;s greater role in child care, stereotype would be reinforced.

The success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits. For instance, since the leave offered is unpaid, majorities of eligible employees can not take time off because they can not afford to do so. And according to Pyle and Pelletier, eligible workers may not even know about this policy and the benefits allotted to them.

Under law, women are protected from sex discrimination in the workplace but a large stigma against women still exists in terms of them being equally skilled as their male co-workers, and ultimately testing the federal protection of rights in a work environment. Like any other federal regulation, it is strictly prohibited for an employer to discriminate towards an employee (especially if the employee is using their FMLA rights), and to strain from providing accurate information for all employees to access.

===Signing ceremony===
Vicki Yandle, a receptionist who was fired after asking for a few weeks of time off to care for a daughter with cancer, was on stage with President Clinton when the law was signed.

<doc id="722486" wikidata="Q1881666" url="?curid=722486" title="Aman Andom">
<text>Aman Mikael Andom (; ; 21 June 1924 – 23 November 1974) was an Ethiopian general and politician who was the first post-imperial acting head of state of Ethiopia. Aman was also the first Chairman of the Derg. He was appointed to this position following the coup d&#x27;état that ousted Emperor Haile Selassie on 12 September 1974, and served until his assassination in a shootout with his former supporters.

== Early life ==
Aman Mikael Andom was born in the village of Tsazega, Italian Eritrea. He had four other siblings. Aman was a Lutheran.

== Military career ==
Educated in Sudan, Aman returned to Ethiopia with the British forces who defeated the Italians and restored Emperor Haile Selassie to the throne. He proceeded to distinguish himself in a brilliant military career, commanding Ethiopian contingents in the Korean War and Congo Crisis. In 1962, he was promoted to major general. During the 1964 Ethiopian–Somali Border War he was given the nickname the &quot;Desert Lion&quot; after a significant battle with Somali forces in the Ogaden.

== Head of State ==
Aman&#x27;s official title was Chairman of the Provisional Military Administrative Council (better known as Derg), and he held the position of Head of State in an acting capacity as the military regime had officially proclaimed Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen as &quot;King-designate&quot; (an act that would later be rescinded by the Derg, and which was never accepted by the Prince as legitimate).

There is some evidence that indicates he had contacts with the officers of the junta as early as February and March 1974, but by July he was appointed chief of staff to the military junta. On 15 September 1974, three days after the junta removed the Emperor Haile Selassie from his palace to imprisonment at the headquarters of the Fourth Division, this group appointed Aman their chairman and head of state of Ethiopia. At the same time, this group of soldiers assumed the name &quot;Provisional Military Administrative Council&quot; (&quot;Derg&quot;).

From the first day of his of him becoming chairman, the Ottaways note, &quot;the general found himself at odds with a majority of the Derg&#x27;s members over most major issues, including whether he was chairman of the ruling military body or simply its spokesman. Aman fought the majority of the Derg over three central issues: the size of Derg, which he felt was too large and unwieldy; the policy to be taken towards the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF); and over the punishment of the numerous aristocrats and former government officials in Derg&#x27;s custody. His refusal to sanction the execution of former high officials, including two former prime ministers and several royal family members and relatives, put his relations with the majority of Derg on an especially bitter footing.

As an Eritrean, General Aman found himself fiercely at odds with the majority of the Derg. He wanted to negotiate a peaceful settlement; his opponents hoped to crush the ELF by military force. Aman went as far as making two personal visits to Eritrea—the first 25 August to 6 September 1974, the second in November 1974—giving speeches stating that the end of the Imperial regime was also the end of old practices towards Eritrea, that a government dedicated to national unity and progress would restore peace and prosperity to Eritrea, and lastly that he would begin investigations concerning crimes that the army had perpetrated on Eritreans and punish the guilty.

However, at the same time the Derg had begun the task of eliminating opponents within the military. The three significant units were the Imperial Bodyguard, the Air Force and the Corps of Engineers; of the three, the most recalcitrant were the Engineers. So on 7 October 1974 soldiers loyal to the Derg stormed the engineers&#x27; camp, killing five, wounding several and detaining the rest. Bahru Zewde later observed, &quot;With that [incident], the illusion that the revolution would remain bloodless was exploded.&quot;

General Aman responded with a personal campaign to seek support outside the Derg, among the rest of the army and the country where he was popular. On 15 November 1974, he sent a message to all military units that was highly critical of the Derg. During a general assembly of the Derg two days later, Mengistu Haile Mariam demanded that 5,000 men be dispatched to Eritrea and six imprisoned Imperial officials be executed; Aman refused, resigned his official posts and retired to his house where he secretly sent appeals to his supporters, especially those in the Third Division. But Mengistu managed to intercept these appeals.

==Assassination==
On 23 November 1974, Aman died in a battle in his home with several troops sent there to arrest him. That same night, the political prisoners that the Derg had marked for execution were taken from Menelik prison, where they had been held, and shifted to the Akaki Central Prison to be executed instead and buried in a mass grave. &quot;It appears that the general had outlived his usefulness,&quot; Bahru Zewde concludes, and was in fact becoming an obstacle to the Derg&#x27;s exercise of power.

<doc id="722487" wikidata="Q2334522" url="?curid=722487" title="Kip Winger">
<text>Charles Frederick &quot;Kip&quot; Winger (born June 21, 1961) is an American singer and bassist, active as a member of the rock band Winger and as a solo artist. He initially gained notability as a member of Alice Cooper&#x27;s band, contributing bass to his &quot;Constrictor&quot; (1986) and &quot;Raise Your Fist and Yell&quot; (1987) albums.

== Biography ==
=== Early days ===
Winger was born in Colorado to parents who were both musicians. At age 16, Winger began studying classical music after hearing the works of composers such as Debussy, Ravel, and Stravinsky in ballet class. At that time he sent a demo tape to Alan Parsons, from whom he received a personal reply.

As a teenager, Winger played in a band named Blackwood Creek with his brothers Nate and Paul plus friend Peter Fletcher (formerly in Pigmy Love Circus). Blackwood Creek disbanded in 1980. Kip, his brothers, and Fletcher also played the Denver area bar scene as the band Colorado. Winger&#x27;s first release was a Rainbow Music Hall live recording of the song &quot;Wizard of the Key&quot; on the &quot;KAZY Thunder on the Mountain&quot; compilation in 1980 under the band name Winger which was the Colorado band line-up under a different name.

In 1982, he studied with Sam Guarnaccia in Denver then moved to New York City and waited tables while studying composition with Edgar Grana.

=== Success ===
Kip Winger&#x27;s first commercial break came in 1984, when he co-wrote the song &quot;Bang Bang&quot; for Kix&#x27;s third album, &quot;Midnite Dynamite&quot;. During that time he was working closely with the record producer Beau Hill, recording bass and vocals on various records. While Reb Beach was working on Fiona Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot; record at Atlantic, Winger and Beach were introduced to each other and later began recording demos. In 1985, Winger joined Alice Cooper&#x27;s band. After making two albums and touring with Cooper, much of the time alongside keyboardist/guitarist Paul Taylor, Winger left in March 1987 to focus on his own band.

Winger returned to New York to work on songs with Reb Beach, and they were soon joined by Paul Taylor and drummer Rod Morgenstein. They initially performed under the name Sahara, but eventually changed their name to Winger, at Alice Cooper&#x27;s suggestion.

The band Winger released three albums (&quot;Winger&quot; (1988), &quot;In the Heart of the Young&quot; (1990), and &quot;Pull&quot; (1993)) before moving on to solo careers.

=== Solo career ===
Kip Winger then moved to New Mexico to work on his solo career, and study with Richard Hermann at the University of New Mexico.

He worked and recorded three solo records in Santa Fe, New Mexico: &quot;This Conversation Seems Like a Dream&quot;, &quot;Down Incognito&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Ocean Floor&quot;.

In 2002 Winger moved to Nashville, Tennessee and began working on his fourth solo record, &quot;From the Moon to the Sun&quot; (2008), which he co-produced with Cenk Eroglu.

=== Reunited Winger ===

In September 2006, it was announced that Winger would be reformed, with the &quot;Pull&quot; era line-up, to record the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;IV&quot;, and to go on tour to support it. During this tour, Winger recorded &quot;Winger Live&quot; which was released on CD and DVD in 2007. It was also confirmed that an anthology of rare tracks and early recordings, &quot;Demo Anthology&quot; (2007) would be released, as well as an autographed limited-edition album, &quot;Seventeen: The Demos&quot;, where only 300 copies were made.

In 2009, Winger recorded their fifth studio album, &quot;Karma&quot;, which was hailed as their best record. The band toured the US, Europe and South America.

=== Classical music ===
Following the release of &quot;From the Moon to the Sun&quot;, Winger studied with Michael Kurek and composed a thirty-minute symphonic piece, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, written for strings, piano and harp for a ballet commission. The work had its premiere with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra on November 14–15, 2009. Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon created the ballet &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which premiered at the San Francisco Ballet on February 9, 2010, with set design by Laura Jellinek, lighting design by M.L. Geiger and costume design by Mark Zappone.

Winger was nominated for an Isadora Duncan Award for Excellence in Music. The ballet was a hit and was brought back for a second season in 2010.

Winger then composed a four-part work entitled &quot;C.F. Kip Winger: Conversations with Nijinsky&quot;, intended to celebrate the life of ballet dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. The album was recorded by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra and reached the top of the Traditional Classical Chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts.

&quot;C.F. Kip Winger: Conversations with Nijinsky&quot; was nominated in the Best Classical Contemporary Composition category at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

=== Get Jack&quot;, A Musical Thriller&quot; ===
Kip Winger&#x27;s theatrical composing debut is the musical thriller &quot;Get Jack&quot;, with book/lyrics by Damien Gray (&quot;Atomic the Musical&quot;, &quot;Animagique&quot;, &quot;Sing On Tour&quot;). The story revolves around the five female victims of Jack the Ripper: Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly—known as the &quot;canonical five&quot;—who rise from the dead to track down Jack and take revenge.

&quot;Get Jack&quot; is currently on development stage, with director Kelly Devine and musical director Andy Peterson, and was presented in concert in October 2019 in New York.

Winger and Gray released the rock/orchestral &quot;Get Jack&quot; concept album in July 2019, which entered at #7 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Cast Albums chart.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Winger&#x27;s composition &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; from the album &quot;IV&quot; honored the service and sacrifice of United States armed forces and their families. In appreciation, General Harold Cross presented Winger with an honorary plaque and historic United States of America flag. The presentation occurred in a surprise ceremony during the taping of the PBS television program &quot;Legends &amp; Lyrics&quot;.

On the television program &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, one of the recurring characters, Stewart Stevenson, wears a Winger T-shirt in contrast to the AC/DC and Metallica shirts worn by Beavis and Butt-Head.

He has participated and performed as head counselor in the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fantasy Camp&quot; with other musicians including Roger Daltrey, Steven Tyler, Todd Rundgren, Jack Blades, Kelly Keagy, Bruce Kulick, Bill Leverty, Steve Lukather, Duff McKagan, Mark Slaughter, Carmine Appice, and Rudy Sarzo. He was featured in an episode of the American TV show &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; in May 2013 as helping the host, Rick Harrison, through Rock Fantasy Camp.

In the early 1990s, the Jackson Guitar Company made a Kip Winger Signature Bass.

<text>Brigadier General Tafari Benti (; 11 October 1921 – 3 February 1977) was an Ethiopian military officer and politician who served as head of state of Ethiopia from 1974 to 1977 in his role as second chairman of the Derg, the ruling military junta. His official title was Chairman of the Provisional Military Administrative Council.

== Early life and career ==

Of ethnic Oromo descent, Tafari Benti joined the Ethiopian Army at the age of 20, graduated from the Holetta Military Academy, and served in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions of the army. In 1967, he served as a military attaché in Washington, D.C. where he and several other Ethiopian colleagues suffered from racial discrimination.

On 23 November 1974, Lt. General Aman Mikael Andom, the first chairman of the Derg and acting head of state, who had been in a struggle for power with the other members of the Derg, was killed in a shootout at his home. Mengistu Haile Mariam served as interim chairman until the Derg appointed Tafari to the position. He had been serving as brigadier general in the Fourth Division, which was stationed in Asmara, at the time of his appointment.

== Tenure ==
During his tenure, Tafari presented himself as the public face of the ruling junta. According to the Ottaways, while at first, he was &quot;a neutral and powerless figure&quot;, in the end &quot;he was too colorless, soft-spoken, and undemonstrative to be the figurehead of the revolution.&quot; However, according to Rene LaFort&#x27;s account, Tafari offered some hints that he supported those opposed to Mengistu. One such hint was in July 1975, when in a public speech he made overtures to the civilian left—groups which included the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and MEISON—proposing a united front &quot;of all the forces that rejected the &quot;ancient regime&quot;, built from the base, that is from the mass organizations born of the great reforms&quot;; LaFort points out that this was &quot;a strategy which Mengistu Haile Mariam and his supporters opposed and would continue to oppose more and more resolutely.&quot; He repeated this message in a speech on the first anniversary of the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie.

During his mandate, he constituted the public face of the Government Board, delivering the public announcements of the Derg. Among which was an announcement made on 11 September 1975, in which the Derg declared it would create a political party to support its objectives aligned with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During his government, in March 1975, the monarchy would finally be officially abolished, proclaiming its replacement by a socialist government of Marxist-Leninist inspiration.

Over the following months, according to LaFort the Derg was split over irreconcilable objectives: &quot;How could the authority of the Committee be strengthened while avoiding the dangers of authoritarianism, and how could the principles of collegiality be maintained while gaining maximum benefit from a concentration of power?&quot; And behind this split was concern at Mengistu&#x27;s growing power. To end this split, the Derg set up a committee chaired by Captain Mogus Wolde Mikael to reform the Derg&#x27;s structure. After nine weeks of what LaFort describes as &quot;strenuous internal negotiations&quot;, on 29 December 1976 Tafari delivered a speech, announcing that the Derg had been restructured. The reorganization limited Mengistu&#x27;s powers and sent his supporters out of the capital to positions in the countryside; on the other hand, two of the key architects of this reform, Captain Mogus and Captain Almayahu Haile, were appointed to powerful positions. His enemies had thought they had clipped Mengistu&#x27;s wings and had removed him as a threat. Tafari went even further and, flanked by Captains Mogus and Almayahu, criticized the lack of a vanguard party in words which LaFort interprets as declaring &quot;the bloody war between MEISON and the EPRP to be politically unjustifiable, and that it should, in any case, remain limited to the civilian Left without the army intervening in any way.&quot;

In 1976, open clashes between members of the two largest Marxist-Leninist organizations began in the country. They grew into the murders of supporters of Mengistu and government employees. Thus, trade union leaders Theodoros Bekel and Themeslin Medé were killed. In September 1976, EPRP members made an assassination attempt on Mengistu himself, which enraged the latter.

== Death ==
Despite this apparent setback, Mengistu proved to be far more resourceful than his opponents believed. He conspired with his longtime friend and ally Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Asfaw to round up Tafari and other Derg members suspected of conspiring with the EPRP. During a routine meeting on 3 February 1977, Tafari and the other Derg members suspected of conspiring with the EPRP were arrested by soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel. According to the memoirs of Fikre Selassie Wogderess, they were then led into a dark garage located in the compound and locked up. Fikre Selassie was also present at the meeting and was mistakenly arrested along with Tafari and the other suspect Derg members. However, Daniel arrived at the garage in time and released Fikre before the summary execution of the others. Shortly thereafter soldiers armed with automatic weapons and silencers arrived and assassinated Tafari and the suspect Derg members: Lieutenant Alemayehu Haile, Captain Mogus Wolde Michael, Corporal Hailu Belay, Lieutenant Colonel Asrat Desta, Lieutenant Colonel Hiruy Haile Selassie and Captain Tefera Deneke. Later, in the evening, a shootout opened in the same compound by another suspected EPRP conspirator Major Yohannes Tiku, where he killed Lieutenant Colonel Daniel and Senay Likke. Major Yohannes was also killed in the shootout.

Shortly afterwards, Radio Ethiopia broadcast a charge by Mengistu that Tafari and his associates had been killed because they were secret supporters of the EPRP. Mengistu claimed he had discovered a 47-page master plan in Tafari&#x27;s possession, which detailed how the EPRP would replace the &quot;scientific socialism&quot; of the Derg.

<text>Peter Joachim Gay (né Fröhlich; June 20, 1923 – May 12, 2015) was a German-American historian, educator, and author. He was a Sterling Professor of History at Yale University and former director of the New York Public Library&#x27;s Center for Scholars and Writers (1997–2003). He received the American Historical Association&#x27;s (AHA) Award for Scholarly Distinction in 2004. He authored over 25 books, including &quot;The Enlightenment: An Interpretation&quot;, a two-volume award winner; &quot;Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider&quot; (1968); and the widely translated &quot;&quot; (1988).

Gay was born in Berlin in 1923, left Germany in 1939 and emigrated, via Cuba, to the United States in 1941. From 1948 to 1955 he was a political science professor at Columbia University, and then a history professor from 1955 to 1969. He left Columbia in 1969 to join Yale University&#x27;s History Department as Professor of Comparative and Intellectual European History and was named Sterling Professor of History in 1984.

Gay was the interim editor of &quot;The American Scholar&quot; after the death of Hiram Haydn in 1973 and served on that magazine&#x27;s editorial board for many years. Sander L. Gilman, a literary historian at Emory University, called Gay &quot;one of the major American historians of European thought, period&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Born to a Jewish family in Berlin, he was educated as a child at Berlin&#x27;s Goethe-Gymnasium. He and his family fled Nazi Germany in 1939, when he was 15 years old. Their original ticket was on the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, whose passengers were eventually turned away and forced to return to Europe, but they fortuitously changed their booking to the SS &quot;Iberia&quot;, which left two weeks earlier. Gay arrived in the United States in 1941, took American citizenship in 1946, and changed his name from Fröhlich (German for &quot;merry&quot; or &quot;cheerful&quot;) to Gay (an English calque).

Gay was educated at the University of Denver, where he received his B.A. in 1946, and at Columbia University, where he received his M.A. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1951. Gay taught political science at Columbia between 1948 and 1955 and history from 1955 to 1969. He taught at Yale University from 1969 until his retirement in 1993.

==Career==

===Scholarship===
According to the American Historical Association&#x27;s Award Citation, Gay&#x27;s range of &quot;scholarly achievements is truly remarkable&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him in 2007 as &quot;the country&#x27;s pre-eminent cultural historian&quot;.

Gay&#x27;s 1959 book, &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Politics: The Poet as Realist,&quot; examined Voltaire as a politician and how his politics influenced the ideas that Voltaire championed in his writings. Accompanying &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Politics&quot; was Gay&#x27;s collection of essays, &quot;The Party of Humanity: Essays in the French Enlightenment&quot; (1964). Gay followed the success of &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Politics&quot; with a two-volume history of the Enlightenment, &quot;The Enlightenment: An Interpretation&quot; (1966, 1969, 1973), whose first volume won the 1967 U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography. Annelien de Dijn argues that Gay, in &quot;The Enlightenment&quot;, first formulated the interpretation that the Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. Although the thesis has many critics, it has been widely accepted by Anglophone scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies done by Robert Darnton, Roy Porter, and Jonathan Israel. Gay&#x27;s 1968 book, &quot;Weimar Culture&quot;, examined the artistic, literary, and musical cultural history of the Weimar Republic.

Gay was also a champion of psychohistory and an admirer of Sigmund Freud. In 1988, he published a biography of Freud, &quot;&quot;. Starting in 1978 with &quot;Freud, Jews and Other Germans&quot;, an examination of the impact of Freudian ideas on German culture, his writing demonstrated an increasing interest in psychology. Many of his works focused on the social impact of psychoanalysis. For example, in &quot;A Godless Jew: Freud, Atheism, and the Making of Psychoanalysis&quot;, he linked Freud&#x27;s atheism to his development of psychoanalysis as a field. He wrote history books applying Freud&#x27;s theories to history, such as &quot;The Bourgeois Experience: From Victoria to Freud&quot;. He also edited a collection of Freud&#x27;s writings called &quot;The Freud Reader&quot;. His writing was generally favorable, though occasionally critical, toward Freud&#x27;s school of thought.

In the September 1981 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Gay published a review he wrote of Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, falsely claiming to have discovered the review in &quot;an obscure Austrian medical journal&quot; from July 1900. Gay claimed, &quot;The whole thing was lighthearted - nothing but a joke&quot;, but others, including Frederick Crews, saw it as an &quot;apparent fraud&quot;, because Gay did not initially make a public statement after scholars took the review seriously, with Freud historian Peter J. Swales citing it in his scholarly work.

Gay&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;&quot; explores the modernist movement in the arts from the 1840s to the 1960s, from its beginnings in Paris to its spread to Berlin and New York City, ending with its death in the pop art of the 1960s.

== Personal life ==
Gay married Ruth Slotkin (1922–2006) in 1959 and had three stepdaughters.

== Death ==
Gay died at his home in Manhattan on May 12, 2015, at the age of 91.

==Awards and recognition==
Gay received numerous awards for his scholarship, including the National Book Award in History and Biography for &quot;The Rise of Modern Paganism&quot; (1967), the first volume of &quot;The Enlightenment&quot;; the first Amsterdam Prize for Historical Science from The Hague, 1990; and the Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, 1992.

Professor Gay held an ACLS Fellowship in 1959–1960. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1967–1968 and 1978–1979; a visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany; and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College University from 1970 to 1971. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1987.

In 1988, he was honored by The New York Public Library as a Library Lion. The following year, he was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He has also been recognized with several honorary doctorates.

<doc id="722503" wikidata="Q1072174" url="?curid=722503" title="Linear system">
<text>In systems theory, a linear system is a mathematical model of a system based on the use of a linear operator.
Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the nonlinear case.
As a mathematical abstraction or idealization, linear systems find important applications in automatic control theory, signal processing, and telecommunications. For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be
modeled by linear systems.

==Definition==

A general deterministic system can be described by an operator, , that maps an input, , as a function of to an output, , a type of black box description.

A system is linear if and only if it satisfies the superposition principle, or equivalently both the additivity and homogeneity properties, without restrictions (that is, for all inputs, all scaling constants and all time.)

The superposition principle means that a linear combination of inputs to the system produces a linear combination of the individual zero-state outputs (that is, outputs setting the initial conditions to zero) corresponding to the individual inputs.

In a system that satisfies the homogeneity property, scaling the input always results in scaling the zero-state response by the same factor. In a system that satisfies the additivity property, adding two inputs always results in adding the corresponding two zero-state responses due to the individual inputs.

Mathematically, for a continuous-time system, given two arbitrary inputs
formula_1
as well as their respective zero-state outputs
formula_2
then a linear system must satisfy
formula_3
for any scalar values and , for any input signals and , and for all time .

The system is then defined by the equation , where is some arbitrary function of time, and is the system state. Given and the system can be solved for 

The behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs. In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation. 
This mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems.
For time-invariant systems this is the basis of the impulse response or the frequency response methods (see LTI system theory), which describe a general input function in terms of unit impulses or frequency components.

Typical differential equations of linear time-invariant systems are well adapted to analysis using the Laplace transform in the continuous case, and the Z-transform in the discrete case (especially in computer implementations).

Another perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of functions which act like vectors in the geometric sense.

A common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by linearization. This is usually done for mathematical convenience.

The previous definition of a linear system is applicable to SISO (single-input single-output) systems. For MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems, input and output signal vectors (formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7) are considered instead of input and output signals (formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11.)

This definition of a linear system is analogous to the definition of a linear differential equation in calculus, and a linear transformation in linear algebra.

===Examples===
A simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:
formula_12

If formula_13
then is a linear operator. Letting we can rewrite the differential equation as which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.

Other examples of linear systems include those described by formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, and any system described by ordinary linear differential equations. Systems described by formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, and a system with odd-symmetry output consisting of a linear region and a saturation (constant) region, are non-linear because they don&#x27;t always satisfy the superposition principle.

The output versus input graph of a linear system need not be a straight line through the origin. For example, consider a system described by formula_15 (such as a constant-capacitance capacitor or a constant-inductance inductor). It is linear because it satisfies the superposition principle. However, when the input is a sinusoid, the output is also a sinusoid, and so its output-input plot is an ellipse centered at the origin rather than a straight line passing through the origin.

Also, the output of a linear system can contain harmonics (and have a smaller fundamental frequency than the input) even when the input is a sinusoid. For example, consider a system described by formula_25. It is linear because it satisfies the superposition principle. However, when the input is a sinusoid of the form formula_26, using product-to-sum trigonometric identities it can be easily shown that the output is formula_27, that is, the output doesn&#x27;t consist only of sinusoids of same frequency as the input (), but instead also of sinusoids of frequencies and ; furthermore, taking the least common multiple of the fundamental period of the sinusoids of the output, it can be shown the fundamental angular frequency of the output is , which is different than that of the input.

==Time-varying impulse response==
The time-varying impulse response of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time &quot;t&quot; = &quot;t&quot;2 to a single impulse applied at time In other words, if the input to a linear system is 
formula_28
where represents the Dirac delta function, and the corresponding response of the system is
formula_29
then the function is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following causality condition must be satisfied:
formula_30

==The convolution integral==

The output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:
formula_31

If the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be time-invariant and is a function only of the time difference which is zero for (namely ). By redefinition of it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,
formula_32

Linear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called the &quot;transfer function&quot; which is:
formula_33

In applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of . Because is zero for negative , the integral may equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting follows the formula for the &quot;frequency response function&quot;:
formula_34

==Discrete-time systems==
The output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:

<text>Negasso Gidada Solon (; 8 September 1943 – 27 April 2019) was an Ethiopian politician who was the president of Ethiopia from 1995 until 2001.

==Biography==
Negasso was the son of Gidada Solon, one of the first local ministers of a Protestant church in the Dembidolo area in western Ethiopia.

Negasso held a doctorate in social history from the Goethe University Frankfurt and was a part-time lecturer of history at Addis Ababa University. The title of his doctoral thesis was &quot;History of the Sayyoo Oromo of Southwestern Wallaga, Ethiopia, from about 1730 to 1886&quot;. He was married to Regina Abelt, a German nurse and midwife. Being the First Lady of Ethiopia while holding the German Citizenship earned Abelt considerable, yet unwanted, attention by the German and European tabloid press. In marked contrast, Regina Abelt was virtually invisible in Ethiopia and never enjoyed the official title of First Lady which was instead used by the wife of the Prime Minister.

Negasso died in Germany on 27 April 2019, after battling health issues.

== Political career ==
In Europe, he was an active member of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). Negasso had been Minister of Information in the Transitional Government of Ethiopia and Central Committee member of the Oromo People&#x27;s Democratic Organisation (OPDO) when he became president on 22 August 1995. He left office when his term expired on 8 October 2001. Before the end of his term, he was expelled from both the OPDO and the EPRDF coalition on 22 June.

In the 2005 general elections, Negasso was elected to the Ethiopian House of People&#x27;s Representatives as an independent from Dembidolo in the Mirab Welega Zone of the Oromia Region.

In July 2008, Negasso became a founding member of the Forum for Democratic Dialogue (FDD), a new coalition of opposition parties and activists. Then in November 2009, he announced he had joined the Unity for Democracy and Justice Party (UDJ), one of the eight parties in the FDD, &quot;to try to unite Ethiopia&quot;. At the time of his announcement, he also asked forgiveness from Ethiopians for deceiving them that Ethiopia&#x27;s current constitution was ratified in 1995 with full participation of all political parties in a democratic manner. &quot;There were a number of political parties that were excluded from the process,&quot; he said during the ceremony when he and Siye Abraha were officially inducted into the UDJ.

<text>Mamallapuram (also known as Mahabalipuram), is a town in Chengalpattu district in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, best known for the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram. It is one of the famous tourist sites in India. The ancient name of the place is Thirukadalmallai. It is a part of Chennai Metropolitan Area. It is a satellite town of Chennai.

Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of royal monuments, many carved out of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), the giant open-air rock relief the &quot;Descent of the Ganges&quot;, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva. The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.

== Etymology ==
The earliest mention of the city is found in the 1st century work called &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; by an unknown Greek navigator. Ptolemy, the Greek geographer refers this place as Malange. Mahabalipuram is also known by other names such as Mamallapattana and Mamallapuram. The term &quot;Mamallapuram&quot; means the city of Mamalla, the other name of the famous Pallava Emperor Narasimhavarman I (630-670 CE) who built the famous temples in the city. Thirumangai Alvar, the famous Vaishnavite saint mentions this place as Thirukadalmallai, referring to the Sthalasayana Perumal Temple. Another name by which Mahabalipuram has been known to mariners, at least since Marco Polo&#x27;s time is &quot;Seven Pagodas&quot; alluding to the Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram that stood on the shore, of which one, the Shore Temple, survives.

== History ==

Neolithic burial urn, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the 1st century BCE have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppadai relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at Kanchipuram of the Tondai Nadu port &quot;Nirppeyyaru&quot; which scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of Theodosius I in the 4th century CE have been found at Mahabalipuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two Pallava coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mahabalipuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mahabalipuram from Kanchipuram; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch trade and diplomatic missions to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. An 8th-century Tamil text written by Thirumangai Alvar described this place as Sea Mountain &#x27;where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps&#x27;.

The temples of Mahabalipuram, portraying events described in the Mahabharata, were built largely during the reigns of King Narasimhavarman and his successor Rajasimhavarman and show the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mahabalipuram was founded by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century CE. The mandapa or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple chariots are hewn from the granite rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mahabalipuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many reliefs, including one long and high, carved out of granite. In 1957 the Government College of Architecture and Sculpture was established to promote and revive the art of making sculptures and temples.

== Transport ==
MTC and TNSTC (Villupuram division) operate bus services between Mamallapuram/Mahabalipuram and Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Thiruttani etc. MTC&#x27;s bus services available from various parts of the Chennai include Deluxe and Air-conditioned buses. Mahabalipuram is 56 km from Chennai.

== Climate ==

== Landmarks ==

The town has a collection of 7th- and 8th-century Hindu religious monuments that has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, about south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

The site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples, including Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna&#x27;s Penance – one of the largest open-air rock relief in the world. The site includes several categories of monuments: &quot;ratha&quot; temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas with halls and stone roofs with narratives from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs of Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; stone cut temples particularly those dedicated to Shiva that also reverentially display Vishnu and others, built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations with inscriptions some dated to 6th century and earlier. The cave temples and monolithic temples were built during the Pallava Period. The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.

Some important structures include:
* &quot;Descent of the Ganges&quot; or &quot;Arjuna&#x27;s Penance&quot; – a giant open-air rock relief.
* &quot;Pancha Rathas&quot; (Five Chariots) – five monolithic pyramidal structures named after the Pandavas (Arjuna, Bhima, Yudhishtra, Nakula and Sahadeva) and Draupadi. Each of these is carved from one single separate large piece of stone.
*Cave Temples – over ten rock-cut temples dating back to the 7th century. These include the Varaha, Adi Varaha, Krishna, Mahishasuramardini (Durga), Ramanuja, Dharmaraja, Koneri, Kotikal, Panchapandava and others.
* The Shore Temple – a structural temple along the Bay of Bengal with the entrance from the western side away from the sea. Recent excavations have revealed new structures here.
* Other structural temples including the Olakkanesvara temple and the lighthouse, along with rock-cut features such as the Draupadi&#x27;s tank and Krishna&#x27;s Butterball.
* Thirukadalmallai, the temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

<text>Didube () is one of two overground stations of Tbilisi Metro in Georgia. It is located on the Akhmeteli-Varketili Line (First Line) and used to be part of original six stations put into operation on 11 January 1966, acting as a northern terminus of the First Line until 1985 when Didube-TEMKA (Nowadays Guramishvili) section was opened.

The station has two entrances, one from the side of Akaki Tsereteli Avenue, next to the Didube Bus Station, accessed through an underway passage, and the second entrance from Tornike Eristavi Street accessed with a bridge above the first track of the station. 

The Didube metro station has a unique location and serves as a transport hub, serving the district of Didube and other northern neighbourhoods of Tbilisi. Because of that, the station is also one of the busiest stations in the network. Notorious overcrowding and congestion are not uncommon in the station and in the area surrounding the metro station, where open shops and bazaars existing in the area add extra weight to the issue. 

Next to the station is Didube Bus Station, one of the busiest bus stations of Tbilisi, which is used for traveling to mainly western and northern directions of country. 

Also, the same-named railway station of Didube lies almost parallel to the station, which is used by some passenger rail routes. 

In the previous century, during the development of the third line of the Tbilisi Metro, Didube metro station was planned to be one of the interlink stations with the third line connecting the network in the direction of Didi Dighomi.

<text>William A. &quot;Pat&quot; Patterson (October, 1899 – June 13, 1980) was the President of United Airlines from 1934 until 1966.
==Life and career==
Patterson was born on a sugarcane plantation in Waipahu on Oahu, Hawaii. When Patterson was 13, his widowed mother moved to San Francisco, California, while he remained at Honolulu Military Academy. Not liking the academy, he decided to leave. He persuaded a captain to allow him to work on his ship in exchange for passage to San Francisco.

Instead of finishing high school in San Francisco, Patterson became an office worker at Wells Fargo bank, though he later attended night school. He became a teller and later a loan officer.

As a loan officer, he authorized a loan to Pacific Air Transport and became an advisor to its founder and president Vern Gorst. When Gorst sold his airline to Boeing Air Transport, the advice that Gorst was receiving from Patterson brought the latter to the attention of Philip G. Johnson of Boeing.

Patterson was recruited by Johnson, leaving Wells Fargo in 1929, and moving to Seattle, Washington, to be the assistant to the president of Boeing Airplane Company and Boeing Air Transport. In 1931 Boeing Air Transport was one of four airlines that merged into United Air Lines and Patterson moved to Chicago to become United&#x27;s general manager.

Two years later, Patterson was promoted to vice president of United. In 1934, in reaction to the Air Mail scandal and the departure of Johnson, Patterson became the company&#x27;s president at the age of 34.

Patterson is credited with starting the profession of flight attendant. He gave his approval to hire eight nurses to work as flight attendants on a three-month trial basis. On May 15, 1930, United became the first airline to use flight attendants, a practice that has since been adopted by every major airline. Patterson&#x27;s daughter, Patty, briefly worked for American Airlines as a flight attendant before her marriage rendered her ineligible. Patterson and C. R. Smith, the CEO of American, shared a friendly rivalry.

Under Patterson, United invested in new technologies, such as the DC-4 and the DC-8 a pioneering jet, and purchased Capital Airlines in 1961 to become the United States&#x27; largest airline, a title it would hold for nearly 40 years. In 1963, when Patterson became United&#x27;s CEO and chairman of the board, the airline had more than 30,000 employees.

He was a life trustee of Northwestern University, and helped establish the Northwestern University Transportation Center in 1954. Patterson received the &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; in 1968 for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.

In 1976, for his contributions to aviation Patterson was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. 

Patterson was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1980.

Near the end of his life, he was honored with the creation of the &quot;William A. Patterson Distinguished Chair in Transportation&quot; through the gifts of more than 12,000 individual and corporate donors. After his death in 1980, the Patterson Endowment established an annual Patterson Lecture and provided other research support.

In 2006, Patterson was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<text>Dolphin Music was an online retailer selling a vast array of musical instruments and recording equipment online and is currently owned by S&amp;T Audio. It first began in Liverpool, England in 1999.

==History==
Robert Williams (11 September 1979 — 2 March 2009) and Jason Tavaria, while still at Liverpool University, used their credit cards &amp; student loans to set up a company that would sell musical equipment by mail order and over the internet.

By 2008 the business had 80 staff and £16m in revenues. In 2009 Robert Williams Co-Founder died whilst snowboarding in Switzerland whilst with Co-Founder Jason Tavaria. In 2011 Dolphin Music was purchased by S&amp;T Audio Ltd, who also own Play Music Today (PMT) retail stores and the PMTonline.co.uk webstore.

==Legacy==
A memorial fund has been established with the Prince&#x27;s Trust with the aim of helping inspire others follow Rob&#x27;s business success following a fatal accident while on holiday – with associates including Michelle Dewberry – snowboarding at Verbier. On 2 March 2009, he slipped 60 ft (20 metres) during treacherous skiing conditions. Jason was found alive via GPS tracking, but Rob was dead by 11pm.

<doc id="722547" wikidata="Q3273967" url="?curid=722547" title="Sheila Majid">
<text>Dato’ Sheila Majid (born Shaheila binti Abdul Majid; 3 January 1965), is a Malaysian pop singer who is best known for her 1986 song, &quot;Sinaran&quot;. Her musical prowess especially in the genre of jazz music has led her to be dubbed as Malaysia&#x27;s Queen of Jazz.

== Biography ==
Sheila Majid was born in Kuala Lumpur, (then in Selangor state), Malaysia on 3 January 1965. Her mother is a native Malay with Mandailing ancestry whose great-great-grandfather was Sutan Puasa, and early settler in Kuala Lumpur. Her father was a Malay of Javanese descent, whose great-grandfather had settled in Malaya after surviving a shipwreck en route to Java from a pilgrimage in Mecca. Her paternal lineage can be traced back to Raden Hussein, whose brother was the first Muslim sultan of Demak; both were princes of Probowo Wijoyo V of Majapahit.

She attended Convent Goodshepherd Kindergarten, Methodist Girls Primary School and Methodist Girls Secondary School, all in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

=== Music career ===
Music was an integral part of Sheila Majid&#x27;s life growing up, starting as a hobby but soon blossoming into a lifelong career. Sheila began learning piano at the age of four, and her talent as a singer was discovered by chance when she performed at a friend&#x27;s gathering at the Raintree Club in Kuala Lumpur at the age of 17. A music publisher, impressed by her voice, introduced her to Roslan Aziz, who conducted her talent test and subsequently offered her a recording contract in 1982. After signing the contract, Sheila took three years to release her debut album, &quot;Dimensi Baru&quot;, in 1985. The album, featuring the single &quot;Pengemis Muda&quot;, achieved gold status, marking her first major success. That same year, Sheila made her acting debut in the film &quot;Ali Setan&quot;, directed by Jins Shamsuddin, where she played Tipah alongside Azmil Mustapha and Ogy Ahmad Daud.

Her second album, &quot;Emosi&quot; (1986), marked a significant turning point in her career, introducing a unique blend of jazz and R&amp;B that was groundbreaking and unheard of for the Malaysian music scene at the time. Furthermore, through the album, the variations of music within Malaysia were increasingly visible, especially in the music genres introduced by her. The significant touch of jazz and R&amp;B music has opened people&#x27;s minds at that time to explore music genres, especially Jazz music pioneered by Sheila. Through the &quot;Emosi&quot; album, she also gained expertise from neighbouring countries, including song arrangement and creation. Therefore, she tried to test the market in Indonesia. To her surprise, she was well received in Indonesia and gained tremendous popularity exceeding that of Malaysia&#x27;s music scene. 

At the time, Indonesia had a burgeoning music scene with the rise of &quot;Pop kreatif&quot;, a genre that flourished amid the increasing liberalization of the creative industry. Drawing inspiration from Japan&#x27;s City pop, &quot;Pop kreatif&quot; reflected the cosmopolitan aspirations and modern lifestyles of Indonesian youth. Sheila Majid&#x27;s blend of jazz, R&amp;B, and pop perfectly aligned with the sound and sensibilities with the genre and thus resonated strongly with the emerging tastes of Indonesian audiences. Taking note of the success of her Malay songs in Indonesia, she released the first single released for this album was ‘Sinaran’, followed by the second single, ‘Antara Anyer dan Jakarta’ dedicated for the Indonesian market. Popularity in Indonesia from the &#x27;Sinaran&#x27; single alone has boosted Sheila from a regional oddity to an international name as ‘Sinaran’ became the first Malay song to top the charts on Radio Sapporo station, in Tokyo. It was also listed at number 38 on Radio Osaka&#x27;s Carta Top 40. Sheila&#x27;s success in Indonesia was exceptional, captivating audiences in major cities like Bandung and Yogyakarta. Despite criticism from some Indonesian media in questioning her popularity and her Malaysian origins, her popularity soared, and she became the first non-Indonesian artist to win the prestigious BASF Award (now the Anugerah Musik Indonesia) for Best Female R&amp;B Artist in 1987 which had never been achieved by a non-Indonesian artist. Her success in Indonesia was further strengthened with a concert tour in 10 cities around the country in June 1988.

She was invited to perform at the Tokyo Music Festival in 1989. At the same time, she made history when she won a platinum award for her album &quot;Warna&quot; in 1988. Through a poll conducted by the New Straits Times newspaper, she was voted as the readers&#x27; choice star for four consecutive years between 1987 and 1990.

== Honours ==
On 24 October 2008, Sheila became the only local artist to receive the Darjah Indera Mahkota Pahang (DIMP) which carries the title of Dato’ in conjunction with the 78th Birthday of the Sultan of Pahang, Sultan Ahmad Shah at the Abu Bakar Palace in Pekan, Pahang.

== Personal life ==
Sheila is married to musician husband Hashridz Murshim bin Hassim, nicknamed Acis, since 2003.

<doc id="722548" wikidata="Q1461951" url="?curid=722548" title="Triakis tetrahedron">
<text>In geometry, a triakis tetrahedron (or tristetrahedron, or kistetrahedron) is a solid constructed by attaching four triangular pyramids onto the triangular faces of a regular tetrahedron, a Kleetope of a tetrahedron. This replaces the triangular faces with three, so there are twelve in total; eight vertices and eighteen edges form them. This interpretation is also expressed in the name, triakis, which is used for the Kleetopes of polyhedra with triangular faces.

The triakis tetrahedron is a Catalan solid, the dual polyhedron of a truncated tetrahedron, an Archimedean solid with four hexagonal and four triangular faces, constructed by cutting off the vertices of a regular tetrahedron; it shares the same symmetry of full tetrahedral formula_1. Each dihedral angle between triangular faces is formula_2. Unlike its dual, the truncated tetrahedron has no vertex-transitive, but rather face-transitive, meaning its solid appearance is unchanged by any transformation like reflecting and rotation between two triangular faces. Whenever a triakis tetrahedron has a hole, it is possible for a polyhedron to exist with the same or larger size passing through it.

<text>In geometry, a triakis octahedron (or trigonal trisoctahedron or kisoctahedron) is an Archimedean dual solid, or a Catalan solid. Its dual is the truncated cube.

It can be seen as an octahedron with triangular pyramids added to each face; that is, it is the Kleetope of the octahedron. It is also sometimes called a &quot;trisoctahedron&quot;, or, more fully, &quot;trigonal trisoctahedron&quot;. Both names reflect that it has three triangular faces for every face of an octahedron. The &quot;tetragonal trisoctahedron&quot; is another name for the deltoidal icositetrahedron, a different polyhedron with three quadrilateral faces for every face of an octahedron.

This convex polyhedron is topologically similar to the concave stellated octahedron. They have the same face connectivity, but the vertices are at different relative distances from the center.

If its shorter edges have length of 1, its surface area and volume are:

Let , then the 14 points and , and are the vertices of a triakis octahedron centered at the origin.

The length of the long edges equals , and that of the short edges .

The faces are isosceles triangles with one obtuse and two acute angles. The obtuse angle equals ≈ ° and the acute ones equal ≈ °.

==Orthogonal projections==
The &quot;triakis octahedron&quot; has three symmetry positions, two located on vertices, and one mid-edge:

<text>Fire in the Sky is a 1993 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Lieberman and adapted by Tracy Tormé. It is based on Travis Walton&#x27;s book &quot;The Walton Experience&quot;, which describes an extraterrestrial abduction. The film stars D. B. Sweeney as Walton, and Robert Patrick as his best friend and future brother-in-law, Mike Rogers. James Garner, Craig Sheffer, Scott MacDonald, Henry Thomas and Peter Berg also star.

&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; grossed $19.9 million domestically on a $15 million budget and received mixed reviews. It was nominated for four Saturn Awards.

==Plot==
On November 5, 1975 in Snowflake, Arizona, logger Travis Walton, and his co-workers—Mike Rogers, Allan Dallis, David Whitlock, Greg Hayes and Bobby Cogdill—head to work in the White Mountains.

Driving back towards town that night, the loggers see unearthly light in the distance through the treeline. Investigating, they encounter an unidentified flying object. Curious, Walton gets out of the truck to examine closer, only for the hovering object to react and strike him with a bright beam of light, hurling him several feet backwards. Fearing Walton has been killed, the terrified loggers escape from the scene. Rogers decides to go back to the spot to retrieve Walton, but he is nowhere to be found.

Returning to town to report the incident, the loggers are met with skepticism by investigators Sheriff Blake Davis and Lieutenant Frank Watters. Watters, realizing that there was a great deal of tension between Dallis and Walton and that the boorish Dallis has a criminal record, suspects , a belief that quickly spreads to the rest of the town, leaving the loggers as social outcasts.

After a large search party turns up no sign of Walton, the loggers are offered the chance to take a lie detector test. Though Dallis is initially hesitant, the loggers ultimately take the test in the hopes of proving their innocence. However, Watters declares that the tests were inconclusive and that they will have to return the next day to retake it. Rogers is outraged and he angrily declines, the other loggers following suit. The test&#x27;s administrator reveals to Watters and Davis that, with the exception of Dallis (whose test results were inconclusive), the loggers seem to be telling the truth.

Five days later, Rogers receives a call from someone claiming to be Walton. He is found at a Heber gas station, alive but naked, dehydrated and severely traumatized. A ufologist questions Walton but he is thrown out and Walton is taken to a hospital. Rogers visits Walton while in the emergency room and ends up telling Walton that he left him after he was struck by the light but came back to get him. Walton appears enraged at being left behind and turns away from Rogers who blames the whole incident on Walton for getting out of the truck. During a welcome home party, Walton suffers from a mental breakdown and flashback of the abduction by the extraterrestrials.

In his flashback, he awakens inside a slimy cocoon. Breaking out of its membrane, a bewildered Walton finds himself adrift in a zero-gravity alien environment inside a cylindrical enclosure, whose walls contain other similar cocoons. Struggling in the low gravity, he accidentally breaches a nearby cocoon, horrified to discover that it contains decomposing human remains. Exploring further, he drifts towards a neighbouring area, seeing several humanoid figures below him. Drifting uncontrollably towards them, he investigates, surmising that the immobile figures are in fact spacesuits, one of which is still occupied by an extraterrestrial creature. Walton attempts to escape, but is apprehended by two aliens who drag him down corridors full of terrestrial detritus such as shoes and keys before arriving in an examination chamber.

The aliens hold the struggling Walton to a platform in the centre of the chamber, stripping him of his clothes and covering him with an elastic material that completely restrains him. Despite Walton&#x27;s terrified screams, the aliens clinically subject him to a torturous experiment in which a gelatinous substance is forced into his mouth, a tube is inserted down his throat, his jaw is locked open and a device is stabbed into his neck. Overhead equipment then begins lowering towards him. As a needle-like ocular probe extends towards his exposed eye, Walton suddenly reawakens from his flashback in a doctor&#x27;s office.

While interviewing Walton, Lieutenant Watters expresses his doubts about the abduction, dismissing it as a hoax. He notes Walton&#x27;s newfound celebrity because of the tabloids&#x27; attempts to profit from his tale, believing that he had faked the abduction to become a celebrity. However, with the investigation closed, Watters is forced to abandon his pursuit and leaves town. Two and a half years later, Walton visits Rogers, now a hermit, and the two reconcile. The closing titles inform that in 1993, Walton, Rogers, and Dallis were resubmitted to additional polygraph examinations, which they passed, corroborating their innocence.

==Production==

The film is based on the book &quot;The Walton Experience&quot; by Travis Walton. In the book, Walton tells how he was abducted by aliens aboard a UFO. Walton&#x27;s original book was later re-released as &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; () to promote the book&#x27;s connection to the film. The real Travis Walton and his wife, Dana Walton, have a brief cameo in the film.

The film&#x27;s alien abduction scenes bear almost no resemblance to Walton&#x27;s actual claims. Scriptwriter Tracy Tormé reported that executives found Walton&#x27;s account boring, and insisted on the changes. Director Robert Lieberman suspected Travis Walton&#x27;s account was a hoax, saying: &quot;My gut feeling had it that Travis was so much smarter than those other guys, that it started out as a gag. They probably laced their beer at the end of the day with a little acid or something and then they put on a show for these guys and they believed it.&quot;

Cast members Scott MacDonald, who played Dan Walton, and Robert Patrick, who played Mike Rogers, spent time with their counterparts. Patrick, who felt typecast in villainous roles following &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, gained weight and grew a beard for the audition. He later found out that he was related to his character: &quot;Lo and behold, when I contacted the Mormons in my family, I found out through marriage, I am related to Mike Rogers. And I was like, ‘I am?!’ I called him, we spoke, I asked him specifically about how he was feeling during all this. I wanted to know his emotions. And he said to me during the abduction and the subsequent conversations afterward, that he could not control his emotion. And I tried to utilize that during the film.&quot;

The special effects in the film were coordinated by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The cinematography by Bill Pope was done in Super 35, the same format he would use in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The original music score was composed and arranged by Mark Isham. The audio soundtrack was released in compact disc format on March 30, 1993 by Varèse Sarabande. An expanded limited edition CD set of the soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records on March 11, 2022, followed by a cassette release by Terror Vision Records on August 19.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviews for &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; were mixed: the film holds a 50% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 appraisals, with an average score of 5.4/10 and the consensus: &quot;While a valiant cast brings an authentic urgency to its harrowing alien abduction saga, &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; unravels a story that&#x27;s ultimately too thin and frustratingly coy with its revelations.&quot;

Nonetheless, its alien abduction scenes are considered by many to be highly effective. In 2017, &quot;Paste&quot; named &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; as one of the 25 best science fiction films on Netflix.

The film also had many favorable reviews. John Ferguson of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Lieberman wisely concentrates on the emotional impact of the event on a close-knit circle of friends and family, although the eventual revelation of the abduction is genuinely scary. D. B. Sweeney shines in the lead role and there&#x27;s good support.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; journalist Owen Gleiberman suggested that &quot;It almost doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t believe any of this stuff. For a few queasy minutes, &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; lets you meditate on the aliens in your imagination.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert said, &quot;The scenes inside the craft are really very good. They convincingly depict a reality I haven&#x27;t seen in the movies before, and for once I did believe that I was seeing something truly alien, and not just a set decorator&#x27;s daydreams.&quot; However, he felt that &quot;there&#x27;s not enough detail about the aliens, and the movie ends on an inconclusive and frustrating note.&quot;

Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; found that &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; &quot;leans in favor of believers, suggesting that all of this really did happen. And some of it is fairly entertaining.&quot; However, he disliked the film&#x27;s sober tone and would have preferred it be &quot;more humorous or satirical, without necessarily sacrificing the sense that these characters believe it all.&quot; Critic James Berardinelli applauded the &quot;stunning, gut-wrenching realism&quot; of the abduction scenes, but called the film a &quot;muddled-up mess&quot; that &quot;can&#x27;t make up its mind whether it wants to be horror, drama or science-fiction.&quot; &quot;The X-Files&quot; creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz were impressed by Patrick&#x27;s performance in the film, which led to his casting Patrick as FBI Special Agent John Doggett for the series&#x27; eighth season in 2000.

Comedian/actor Patton Oswalt put &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; on his Top 5 Sci-Fi Films in an interview for &quot;GQ&quot;.

==Accolades==
&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; was nominated for four Saturn Awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Writing, Best Music, and for Patrick, Best Actor.

<text>In geometry, a [[Conway kis operator|tetrakis]] hexahedron (also known as a tetrahexahedron, hextetrahedron, tetrakis cube, and kiscube) is a Catalan solid. Its dual is the truncated octahedron, an Archimedean solid.

It can be called a disdyakis hexahedron or hexakis tetrahedron as the dual of an omnitruncated tetrahedron, and as the barycentric subdivision of a tetrahedron.

== Cartesian coordinates ==

Cartesian coordinates for the 14 vertices of a tetrakis hexahedron centered at the origin, are the points 
formula_1

The length of the shorter edges of this tetrakis hexahedron equals 3/2 and that of the longer edges equals 2. The faces are acute isosceles triangles. The larger angle of these equals formula_2 and the two smaller ones equal formula_3.

==Orthogonal projections==
The &quot;tetrakis hexahedron&quot;, dual of the truncated octahedron has 3 symmetry positions, two located on vertices and one mid-edge.
==Uses==
Naturally occurring (crystal) formations of tetrahexahedra are observed in copper and fluorite systems.

Polyhedral dice shaped like the tetrakis hexahedron are occasionally used by gamers.

A 24-cell viewed under a vertex-first perspective projection has a surface topology of a tetrakis hexahedron and the geometric proportions of the rhombic dodecahedron, with the rhombic faces divided into two triangles.

The tetrakis hexahedron appears as one of the simplest examples in building theory. Consider the Riemannian symmetric space associated to the group &quot;SL&quot;4(R). Its Tits boundary has the structure of a spherical building whose apartments are 2-dimensional spheres. The partition of this sphere into spherical simplices (chambers) can be obtained by taking the radial projection of a tetrakis hexahedron.

==Symmetry==
With Td, [3,3] (*332) tetrahedral symmetry, the triangular faces represent the 24 fundamental domains of tetrahedral symmetry. This polyhedron can be constructed from 6 great circles on a sphere. It can also be seen by a cube with its square faces triangulated by their vertices and face centers and a tetrahedron with its faces divided by vertices, mid-edges, and a central point.

The edges of the spherical tetrakis hexahedron belong to six great circles, which correspond to mirror planes in tetrahedral symmetry. They can be grouped into three pairs of orthogonal circles (which typically intersect on one coordinate axis each). In the images below these square hosohedra are colored red, green and blue.

==Dimensions==

If we denote the edge length of the base cube by , the height of each pyramid summit above the cube is The inclination of each triangular face of the pyramid versus the cube face is formula_4 . One edge of the isosceles triangles has length , the other two have length which follows by applying the Pythagorean theorem to height and base length. This yields an altitude of formula_5 in the triangle (). Its area is formula_6 and the internal angles are formula_7 and the complementary formula_8

The volume of the pyramid is so the total volume of the six pyramids and the cube in the hexahedron is 

== Kleetope ==

It can be seen as a cube with square pyramids covering each square face; that is, it is the Kleetope of the cube. A non-convex form of this shape, with equilateral triangle faces, has the same surface geometry as the regular octahedron, and a paper octahedron model can be re-folded into this shape. This form of the tetrakis hexahedron was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci in Luca Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot; (1509).

This non-convex form of the tetrakis hexahedron can be folded along the square faces of the inner cube as a net for a four-dimensional cubic pyramid.

== Related polyhedra and tilings==


It is a polyhedra in a sequence defined by the face configuration V4.6.2&quot;n&quot;. This group is special for having all even number of edges per vertex and form bisecting planes through the polyhedra and infinite lines in the plane, and continuing into the hyperbolic plane for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 7.

With an even number of faces at every vertex, these polyhedra and tilings can be shown by alternating two colors so all adjacent faces have different colors.

Each face on these domains also corresponds to the fundamental domain of a symmetry group with order 2,3,&quot;n&quot; mirrors at each triangle face vertex.

<doc id="722565" wikidata="Q1445686" url="?curid=722565" title="Ketolide">
<text>Ketolides are antibiotics belonging to the macrolide group. Ketolides are derived from erythromycin by substituting the cladinose sugar with a keto-group and attaching a cyclic carbamate group in the lactone ring. These modifications give ketolides much broader spectrum than other macrolides. Moreover, ketolides are effective against macrolide-resistant bacteria, due to their ability to bind at two sites at the bacterial ribosome as well as having a structural modification that makes them poor substrates for efflux-pump mediated resistance.

Ketolides block protein synthesis by binding to ribosomal subunits and may also inhibit the formation of newly forming ribosomes. According to a recent study comparing the action of the classic macrolides erythromycin and azithromycin with ketolides, which are used to treat serious infections, the more powerful drugs (ketolides) were the more &quot;leaky&quot; in blocking the production of proteins. The researchers were surprised to discover that ketolides, which are known to be better antibiotics, allow for many more proteins to be made compared to the older, less efficient macrolides. As a result, it is now believed that allowing cells to make some proteins could be much more damaging for a microbe than not letting it make any proteins at all. The findings may point the way to better and more potent antibiotics.

The only ketolide on the market at this moment is telithromycin, which is sold under the brand name of Ketek. Other ketolides in development include cethromycin and solithromycin.

==Medical uses ==
Ketolides are used to treat community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Other respiratory tract infections were removed as indications when it was recognized that use of telithromycin can result in hepatitis and liver failure.

<text>A daina or tautas dziesma is a traditional form of music or poetry from Latvia. Lithuanian &quot;dainos&quot; share common traits with them, but have been more influenced by European folk song traditions. Latvian dainas often feature drone vocal styles and pre-Christian themes and legends, and can be accompanied by musical instruments such as Baltic psalteries (e.g. kokles).
Dainas tend to be very short (usually four-liners) and are usually in a trochaic or a dactylic metre. Dainas are being translated into English by Latvian American Ieva Auziņa-Szentivanyi.

==Poetic metre and its limitations==
The trochaic metre is the most popular, with around 95% of dainas being in it. Characteristic of this metre is that an unstressed syllable follows a stressed syllable, with two syllables forming one foot. Two feet form a dipody and after every dipody, there is a caesura, which cannot be in the middle of a word. The dainas traditionally are written down so that every line contains two dipodies. If a caesura is followed by three syllables, the last syllable – i.e. the one at the end of the line – is long; if four syllables follow it is short. A syllable is considered short if it contains a short vowel or a short vowel and S; all other syllables are considered long. This results in a rather limited vocabulary as a dipody can consist of either one four-syllable word, two two-syllable words, one one-syllable and one three-syllable word or two one-syllable words and one two-syllable word. Exceptions are mostly found in Eastern Latvian dialects, which allow words to start one syllable before or after where the caesura normally would be, thus allowing five-syllable combinations. This inconsistency is usually found only in one or two lines, most often in the second or fourth. The notion of short and long syllables at the end of lines is retained. However, the syllable after a lost caesura is often unstressed as it is in everyday speech.

A sound may be added or removed to increase vocabulary there or elsewhere. The addition of sounds is explained with structural changes in the language itself (loss of vowels in word endings). The sound added at the end of a word is usually I, in some rare cases also A, U or E (the last of these mostly in some regions of Courland). Occasionally contractions occur and I replaces a diminutive ending in I – i.e. the ending is retained but separated from the rest of the word by a caesura. This can perhaps be explained by diminutives being so popular in dainas that people didn&#x27;t find it appropriate to replace one with the same word without it, which would be a syllable shorter. Sometimes a diminutive is added to increase the number of syllables even when the meaning of the word is the opposite of what is usually expressed with the diminutive. Similarly, the need to match the metric might cause disagreement in tenses.

==Stylistic devices==
Dainas feature several stylistic devices to ensure euphony. Common devices use repetition; these include alliteration (repetition of similar consonants in stressed syllables), anaphora and epiphora (the use of the same words at the beginning and end of lines, the repetition of a word, a combination of words or previous line, or starting a new sentence with a word that has the same root as the last word of the previous sentence). Comparisons and other symbolic devices are also found in their range, including straightforward comparisons, epithets, metaphors, synecdoches, allegories, personifications and parallelisms where seemingly unrelated concepts are used to liken events from nature to human life and different social classes.

==Themes==
Lyrically, dainas concern themselves with native mythology and traditional festivals but, in contrast to most similar forms, do not have any legendary heroes. Stories often revolve around pre-Christian deities like the sun goddess Saule and the moon god Mēness. There are dainas that do not have a mythical theme as well – many simply describe the daily life of agrarian society and nature. However, these still often include personifications of natural phenomena. Another major theme is the human life cycle, especially the three major events: birth, wedding, and death (including burial). The dainas concerning birth are deeply emotional, and usually feature a mother figure not only as the person who gives birth but also as the one who determines the fate of the child. These also often feature the fate deity Laima and were historically sung immediately after birth, which traditionally took place in a bathhouse. Many dainas are set apart from others by erotic and sexual themes and mockery. These are commonly known as nerātnās (naughty) dainas. The dainas devoted to death describe an individual preparing for death and often relate to funeral customs. These often feature a female god related to the world of the dead, variously known as kapu māte, veļu māte, zemes māte or smilšu māte (mother of graves, mother of dead, mother Earth, mother of sand). The first collection of dainas was published between 1894 and 1915 as Latvju Dainas by Krišjānis Barons. There are well over two hundred thousand collected dainas in written form.

<text>The Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia) is the most senior regiment of the British Army Reserve. The regiment was formed in 1539 during the reign of by King Henry VIII. The R Mon RE (M) became a militia unit in 1660 and then became a part of the Royal Engineers in 1877.

==History==

=== The two &#x27;Royals&#x27; ===
The regiment was formed as a &quot;posse comitatus&quot; in 1539 during the reign of by King Henry VIII; it went on to become a trained band and then a militia unit in 1660. It is unique in having the word &#x27;Royal&#x27; appear twice in its name. It gained the first Royal in 1804 when it was the Monmouth and Brecon Militia. The second was acquired in 1877 when the regiment transferred from an infantry unit into a Special Reserve section of the expanding Royal Engineers.

On 1 April 1967, the existing regiment absorbed 43rd Wessex Division RE (TA), 48th South Midland Division RE (TA) and 53rd Welsh Division RE (TA).

=== Seniority dispute with the Honourable Artillery Company ===

The records of the Honorable Artillery Company (HAC) indicate that it was formed two years prior to the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia). However, in 1930 the Army Council (Army Board from 1964) reviewed the Army&#x27;s precedence table and King George V agreed that, on account of its status as a militia unit, the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia) were the senior regiment. In 1957 the matter was investigated further and Queen Elizabeth II also agreed that the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (Militia) were the senior regiment:
&quot;From:-Lieut.-Colonel The Rt. Hon. Sir Michael Adeane, K.C.B., K.C.V.O .&quot; &quot;Private Secretary to the Queen,&quot; &quot;Buckingham Palace, S.W.1.&quot; &quot;12th March, 1957.&quot;

&quot;My dear Playfair,&quot;
&quot;Thank you for your letter of 8th March which I have laid before The Queen and which Her Majesty has read with interest.&quot;
&quot;I am to say that the recommendation of the Honours and Distinctions Committee with regard to the relative precedence of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers and the Honourable ArtiIlery Company meets with the Queen&#x27;s approval.&quot;

&quot;Yours sincerely,&quot;
&quot;M. E. ADEANE&quot;

=== The Royal Jersey Militia ===

The Jersey Militia were brought under the command of the R Mon RE (M) in 2007. The Jersey Militia was formed in 1337 when Edward III ordered &quot;all his faithful peoples of the islands&quot; to be prepared - by forming a militia - for possible war with France. The militia defended the island against several pirate raids, and in 1549 against a French invasion attempt. The militia played a role in the Battle of Jersey, for which its actions gained it the &#x27;Royal&#x27; title.

=== Militia and Militiamen ===
Militia historically were regarded as light infantry regiments. In recognition of its Light Infantry ancestry the regiment was afforded the right to wear the Militia flash in 1943. A small, light infantry green rectangle, often referred to as the snooker table; worn at the top of the left arm. Soldiers of the regiment are Sappers but also militiamen and wear the militia flash in perpetuity, as observed by Brigadier John Henry Ridge CBE when inspecting troops during the Sapper 300 celebrations in 2016. 

== Current organisation ==

<doc id="722610" wikidata="Q2916576" url="?curid=722610" title="Linn Berggren">
<text>Malin Sofia Katarina Berggren (born 31 October 1970) is a Swedish singer-songwriter, best known as a former member of the pop music band Ace of Base. Having been interested and involved in music since her childhood, she formed the band in 1987, along with her sister Jenny, her brother Jonas and their friend Ulf Ekberg. Before forming Ace of Base, Malin sang in her church&#x27;s choir. She was born in Gothenburg, Sweden.

When Ace of Base was signed to Danish label Mega Records in 1990, Malin, or Linn as she became known, chose to put her teaching career on hold. 

In 1997, Linn said: &quot;I wanted to sing; I never wanted to be a singer&quot;. That year, she began to fade out of the spotlight, leading to her last public appearance in 2002. According to her brother Jonas, Linn has been living a peaceful life since then.

==Ace of Base==
===Frontwoman (1992–1996)===
During the promotion for Ace of Base&#x27;s first album, Linn was the principal lead vocalist for the majority of the singles and was generally the focus in the videos, although on some singles (&quot;The Sign&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Magic&quot;) and album tracks Jenny and Linn shared leads. Linn had a somewhat minor role in the composition of &quot;Happy Nation&quot; and &quot;The Sign&quot;, only having co-writing credits on one track on a re-release of the former. She was influential in the development of &quot;All That She Wants&quot;, demanding that the track be changed from major key to minor. 

In 1994, a German girl invaded the Berggren family home, targeting Linn. Linn was not present, but the girl attacked Jenny and her mother with a knife. This incident had a large impact on Linn. 

During the release of the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, the focus in both vocals and media became more equal with her younger sister, Jenny. Linn had a larger role in the composition of &quot;The Bridge&quot; and wrote and produced several songs for the album. Following the completion of the album, it was reported that Linn developed unspecified recurrent vocal problems.

Beginning in late 1995, Linn began to express discomfort in how successful the band had become, explaining in an interview &quot;this business, I don&#x27;t want to be in it for too long.&quot; She later remarked in a 1996 interview: &quot;All this wasn&#x27;t my plan. For me, this is too big, especially with the success in America. It doesn&#x27;t look like it, but it costs a lot of energy to push yourself to success on this level. We have to push forward, but I just can&#x27;t, I want to push backwards.&quot; She also explained her fear of flying, remarking &quot;when the plane goes down, my heart skips a beat and I can&#x27;t breathe, talk, speak or move.&quot; The band went on 179 flights for music promotion in 1995, which made Linn disenchanted with touring. In the same interview, she alluded to her plans for the future: &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking about travelling by train or car and doing very little promotion.&quot; In the midst of promotion in Asia for &quot;The Bridge&quot; in the spring of 1996, Linn left prematurely, leaving the rest of the band members to continue in her absence. Her final performance with the band as a frontwoman was of &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; at the World Music Awards in May 1996.

===Background role (1997–2003)===
In 1997, it was reported that Linn would venture into a solo project, releasing the song &quot;Lapponia&quot;, which was previously submitted for inclusion on &quot;The Bridge&quot; and later for &quot;Flowers&quot;. The song was to be accompanied by a documentary about Sápmi culture. Despite this, the song never received an official release.

Beginning in 1997, Linn appeared at her band&#x27;s concerts only to perform in the background behind keyboards. In Linn&#x27;s last personal television interview, from 1997, she stated her wish to &quot;try what Jenny has done&quot; by no longer being the focus of the band. In April 1997, the band performed &quot;Ravine&quot; at the World Music Awards with Linn miming keyboard playing in the far background of the stage. Claes Cornelius at Mega Records said it was because she did not wish to wear the heavy make-up the performance would have required. In July 1997, the group performed a concert for Princess Victoria&#x27;s 20th birthday. Linn generally performed keyboards in the background for most of the concert, but performed a live a cappella song in the foreground prior to the main show. That same year, both Jenny and Linn appeared at the &quot;Swedish Grammis&quot; as presenters for the &quot;best song&quot; award.

The first official press photos released for the &quot;Flowers&quot; / &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; albums, released on 21 March 1998, show Linn in equal or greater focus than that of her bandmates. However, many future promotional materials for the albums, as well as those used in the album booklets, contain blurred, unsmiling, distinctly unhappy photographs of her. The &quot;Flowers&quot; album in particular uses a photograph where Linn&#x27;s unhappy image is bizarrely hidden behind the booklet&#x27;s blue line design. According to Jonas, Clive Davis&#x27;s insistence that Linn record &quot;Everytime It Rains&quot; for the &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; album in 1998 was &quot;the tipping point&quot; for Linn&#x27;s withdrawal from the band and that it &quot;was the worst thing for her&quot;. Jenny had recorded a version of the song, but Arista Records was unhappy with this version and pressed the band for Linn to record a version featuring only her vocals. Upon the release of the albums, Linn&#x27;s vocal contributions were reduced in comparison to the group&#x27;s previous releases. Beginning with &quot;Life is a Flower&quot;, Linn&#x27;s appearance in the band&#x27;s music videos became much less than it had been in previous videos. She no longer mimed her vocal parts in the videos and her screen time was drastically shortened. Her image in the videos became at times blurred (&quot;Cruel Summer&quot;) or almost nonexistent (&quot;Travel to Romantis&quot;). Linn walked off the set of the &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; music video in Rome whilst filming; her manager said it was because she did not wish to appear in the foreground of the video. Director Nigel Dick later revealed she would not have appeared at all, were it not for his insistence. Linn infrequently took part in group interviews with her other band members throughout 1998 for the promotion of the &quot;Flowers&quot; album, however, her participation was often minimal, and in many cases the band performed as a trio. In one such interview, however, Linn expressed her desire to further her music production skills. That year, &quot;Bravo&quot; magazine claimed that Linn was seriously ill, based on Linn&#x27;s odd appearance on Germany&#x27;s television spot &quot;The Dome&quot;, and photos appearing in &quot;Bravo&quot;. Linn granted one final radio interview on Mix FM in Lebanon in late 1998, where she talked about new album plans and sang &quot;All That She Wants&quot; a capella.

The band&#x27;s management and record companies have explained Linn&#x27;s odd behaviour with a number of reasons. In 1998, the band announced via their website that they would be placing media focus on Jenny due to Linn having recurring vocal problems. Linn&#x27;s long-time fear of flying was also cited as the reason for her absence at the band&#x27;s concerts. However, Linn also did not appear at events in Gothenburg and Copenhagen, where she would not have had to fly. The other band members have been somewhat reluctant to explain what has happened to Ace of Base&#x27;s former lead singer. They have stated that she has always been a shy and retiring person and was happy to let Jenny lead the band, while Ulf Ekberg once claimed Linn had a &quot;camera phobia&quot;. The knife attack on Jenny and her mother in 1994 may have also increased her reluctance to appear in public. In 2007, Ulf commented that Linn withdrew from the band&#x27;s activities &quot;for the simple reason that she did not want to [participate].&quot;

In the &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie (Always 21)&quot; music video, filmed in 1999, Linn&#x27;s image was no longer blurred or out of focus, and she appeared to be happy and an active participant. However, she still did not mime during her parts in the song and her screen time was significantly less than her bandmates. A photoshoot taken at the same time similarly shows her more in the spotlight. During this time, the group began promoting mainly as a duo with Jenny and Ulf, a strategy that Jonas remarked led to &quot;less questions&quot; about Linn&#x27;s lack of participation, however, Linn did attend some performances of the single, albeit still relegated to a background role. In 2002, Linn co-wrote three tracks with her bandmates on the group&#x27;s release &quot;Da Capo&quot;. However, her vocals appeared on fewer than half of the album&#x27;s tracks. Her last public appearance was during the promotion of &quot;Da Capo&quot; in September 2002, where she showed up to a German television performance and mimed playing the keyboards in the background. A fan snapped a picture of a calm, smiling Linn outside the studio. Her final appearance with Ace of Base was in the Unspeakable music video which was filmed in December 2002. This video featured Linn in her first and only close-up shots in a music video since 1996. Linn has not been pictured since that year. On 24 September 2003, Linn&#x27;s profile on the band&#x27;s official website was updated, and it was noted that her favourite song from the &quot;Da Capo&quot; album was &quot;Ordinary Day&quot;.

===Hiatus (2004–2007)===
In the spring of 2005, interviews with Linn&#x27;s sister Jenny seemed to indicate Linn&#x27;s desire to return to the spotlight again, but Linn still remained hidden from the public. In October and November 2005, the band made appearances at a series of 15 concerts at the Night of the Proms in Belgium; as usual, Linn was &quot;unable to attend&quot;, and only Jonas, Ulf, and Jenny made appearances at these concerts. During this time, Linn also recorded backing vocals for the track &quot;High Life&quot; in Jenny&#x27;s secondary band, Arose; the song was released on their debut album in February 2006. In 2006, it was mentioned that Ace of Base had recorded six new songs featuring vocals by both Malin and Jenny. Some of these tracks later surfaced on the 2015 release &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;.

===Departure (2007)===
According to an interview given by Ulf Ekberg on 20 June 2006, Malin returned to University to study Judaism and would record vocals on the band&#x27;s new album. However, on 30 November 2007, Ulf stated in an interview that Malin Berggren had left the band and she would not appear on the band&#x27;s new album. The group had already been performing mostly without Linn as a trio for a solid decade before her departure. Bandmate and sister Jenny confirmed Linn&#x27;s departure in the Danish press: &quot;She hasn&#x27;t been part of Ace of Base for several years,&quot; she stated in &quot;Se &amp; Hør&quot; magazine. Ulf remarked: &quot;She has no craving to be famous, she loved her fans, but the fame factor was not for her.&quot; The remaining band members promised Linn that they would never ask her to rejoin the band ever again. Linn&#x27;s image was removed from most material on the band&#x27;s official website but was reintroduced upon the release of &quot;Hidden Gems&quot;.

==Personal life==
Linn is multi-lingual: her primary language is Swedish, but she speaks fluent English and German; she also speaks Spanish, Russian and French. Other details of Linn&#x27;s life, such as those of her life outside the band, are unknown to the public—whereas the other band members have been open about their relationships (Jonas and Jenny both have spouses, each with children, and Ulf has three children with his long-time girlfriend). As of 2015, Jonas confirmed he still sees Linn regularly and that she is enjoying a peaceful life with no interest in fame or returning to music.

<doc id="722616" wikidata="Q603291" url="?curid=722616" title="Historical fantasy">
<text>Historical fantasy is a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into a more &quot;realistic&quot; narrative. There is much crossover with other subgenres of fantasy; those classed as Arthurian, Celtic, or Dark Ages could just as easily be placed in historical fantasy. Stories fitting this classification generally take place prior to the 20th century.

Films of this genre may have plots set in biblical times or classical antiquity. They often have plots based very loosely on mythology or legends of Greek-Roman history, or the surrounding cultures of the same era.

==Overview==
Historical fantasy usually takes one of three common approaches:

# Magic, mythical creatures, such as dragons, or other supernatural elements, such as magic rings, co-exist invisibly with the mundane world, with the majority of people being unaware of it. In this, it has a close similarity to contemporary fantasy. This commonly overlaps with the secret history trope. Alternatively, the author&#x27;s narrative shows or implies that by the present day, magic will have &quot;retreated&quot; from the world or been hidden to all but a few initiates so as to allow history to revert to the familiar version we know. An example of this can be found in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The Charwoman&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, which takes place in Spain, but which ends with the magician in it removing himself and all creatures of romance from the world, thereby ending the Golden Age.
# It also can include an alternative history, in which the past or present has been significantly changed when an actual historical event turned out differently.
# The story takes place in a secondary world with specific and recognizable parallels to a known place (or places) and a definite historical period, rather than taking the geographic and historical &quot;mix and match&quot; favoured by other works of secondary world fantasy. However, many, if not most, works by fantasy authors derive ideas and inspiration from real events, making the borders of this approach unclear.
All three approaches have overlapped in the subgenre of steampunk commonly associated with science fiction literature. However, not all steampunk fantasy belongs to the historical fantasy subgenre.

==Subgenres==
===Arabian fantasy===
After Antoine Galland&#x27;s translation of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; became popular in Europe, many writers wrote fantasy based on Galland&#x27;s romantic image of the Middle East and North Africa. Early examples included the satirical tales of Anthony Hamilton, and &quot;Zadig&quot; by Voltaire. English-language work in the Arabian fantasy genre includes &quot;Rasselas&quot; (1759) by Samuel Johnson, &quot;The Tales of the Genii&quot; by James Ridley (1764), &quot;Vathek&quot; by William Thomas Beckford (1786), George Meredith&#x27;s &quot;The Shaving of Shagpat&quot; (1856), &quot;Khaled&quot; (1891) by F. Marion Crawford, and James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s &quot;Hassan&quot; (1922).

In the late 1970s, interest in the subgenre revived with &quot;Hasan&quot; (1977) by Piers Anthony. This was followed by several other novels reworking Arabian legend: the metafictional &quot;The Arabian Nightmare&quot; (1983) by Robert Irwin, Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; children&#x27;s novel &quot;Castle in the Air&quot; (1990), Tom Holt&#x27;s humorous &quot;Djinn Rummy&quot; (1995) and Hilari Bell&#x27;s &quot;Fall of a Kingdom&quot;.

===Celtic fantasy===
Celtic fantasy has links to historical fantasy and Celtic historical fiction. Celtic historical fantasy includes such works as Katharine Kerr&#x27;s &quot;Deverry&quot; series, or Teresa Edgerton&#x27;s &quot;Green Lion&quot; trilogy. These works are (loosely) based on ancient Celtic cultures. The separate folklore of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland has sometimes been used indiscriminately, sometimes with great effect, as in Paul Hazel&#x27;s &quot;Finnbranch&quot; trilogy, &quot;Yearwood&quot; (1980), &quot;Undersea&quot;, (1982) and &quot;Winterking&quot; (1985); other writers have distinguished between the three to use a single source.

Notable works inspired by Irish mythology included James Stephens&#x27; &quot;The Crock of Gold&quot; (1912), Lord Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The Curse of the Wise Woman&quot; (1933), Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s humorous &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; (1939), Pat O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s &quot;The Hounds of the Morrigan&quot; (1985) and novels by Peter Tremayne, Morgan Llywelyn and Gregory Frost.

The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential, which has to do with its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work, the epic &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of Evangeline Walton: &quot;The Island of the Mighty&quot;, &quot;The Children of Llyr&quot;, &quot;The Song of Rhiannon&quot;, and &quot;Prince of Annwn&quot;. A notable amount of fiction has been written in the Welsh area of Celtic fantasy; other notable authors of Welsh Celtic fantasy include Kenneth Morris, John Cowper Powys, Vaughan Wilkins, Lloyd Alexander, Alan Garner, and Jenny Nimmo.

Scottish Celtic fantasy is less common, but James Hogg, John Francis Campbell (&quot;The Celtic Dragon Myth&quot;, 1911), Fiona MacLeod, William Sharp, George Mackay Brown and Deborah Turner Harris all wrote material based on Scottish myths and legends.

Fantasy based on the Breton folklore branch of Celtic mythology does not often appear in the English language. However, several noted writers have utilized such material; Robert W. Chambers&#x27; &quot;The Demoiselle d&#x27;Ys&quot; (from &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, 1895) and A. Merritt in &quot;Creep, Shadow!&quot; (1934) both drew on the Breton legend of the lost city of Ys, while &quot;The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun&quot; (1930) by J. R. R. Tolkien is a narrative poem based on the Breton legend of the Corrigan.

===Classical fantasy===
Classical fantasy is a subgenre of historical fantasy based on the Greek and Roman myths. Symbolism from classical mythology is enormously influential on Western culture, but it was not until the 19th century that it was used in the context of literary fantasy. Richard Garnett (&quot;The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales&quot;, 1888, revised 1903) and John Kendrick Bangs (&quot;Olympian Nights&quot;, 1902) used the Greek myths for satirical purposes.

20th-century writers who made extensive use of the subgenre included John Erksine, who continued the satirical tradition of classical fantasy in such works as &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot; (1925) and &quot;Venus, the Lonely Goddess&quot; (1949). Eden Phillpotts used Greek myths to make philosophical points in such fantasies as &quot;Pan and the Twins&quot; (1922) and &quot;Circe&#x27;s Island&quot; (1925). Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;The Reign of Wizardry&quot; (&quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;, 1940) is an adventure story based on the legend of Theseus. Several of Thomas Burnett Swann&#x27;s novels draw on Greek and Roman myth, including &quot;Day of the Minotaur&quot; (1966). &quot;The Firebrand&quot; (1986) by Marion Zimmer Bradley and &quot;Olympic Games&quot; (2004) by Leslie What are both classical fantasy tales with feminist undertones. Guy Gavriel Kay who has made a career out of historical fantasy, set his two novels in &quot;The Sarantine Mosaic&quot; series in a parallel world heavily mirroring Justinian I&#x27;s Byzantium.

===Fantasy of manners===
Fantasy of manners, aka &quot;mannerpunk,&quot; is a subgenre that takes place within a strict, elaborate, and hierarchical social structure. Inspired by the social novels and the comedy of manners of such authors as Jane Austen and Oscar Wilde, fantasy of manners involves class struggles among genteel characters in urban environments, and while duels are permitted, witty repartee often substitutes for physical conflict. Examples of fantasy of manners include &quot;Swordspoint&quot; by Ellen Kushner and &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; by Susanna Clarke.

===Fantasy steampunk===
Fantasy steampunk is another subgenre of historical fantasy, generally set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras. Steam technology, mixed with Victorian or Gothic-style architecture and technology, is the most widely recognized interpretation of this genre. One of the most popular characteristics of steampunk is the appearance of naked clockwork, rusty gears, and engines. Typically, gunpowder fantasy also includes elements of real-world technology such as steam power, telegraphy, and in some cases early telephones or combustion engines. Some works in this genre are alternate history.

Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; is an example of a Fantasy steampunk novel, along with &quot;The Half-Made World&quot; by Felix Gilman and &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; by Tim Powers.

====Gaslamp fantasy====
Gaslamp fantasy is a subgenre to both steampunk and historical fantasy that takes place in an alternative universe based on Victorian or Edwardian eras. However, magic plays a more important role than the era&#x27;s mechanical technology.

===Gunpowder fantasy===
Sometimes called &quot;muskets and magic&quot;. Gunpowder fantasy is generally set in a world with technology roughly equivalent to Early modern Europe (16th through 18th centuries), particularly the latter era. Gunpowder fantasy combines elements of high fantasy (magic, mythical creatures, races like elves, epic scale) with guns like muskets and rifles. It is a relatively new subgenre, but has been picking up popularity. It varies from medieval fantasy by inclusion of gunpowder. It varies from steampunk in that it stays away from the fantastic inventions (airships, machines, etc.) that are common in steampunk. Similar to steampunk, gunpowder fantasy is considered a step below its more popular cousin.

Gunpowder fantasy examples include Solomon Kane series &quot;(1928–)&quot; created by Robert E. Howard, &quot;Monster Blood Tattoo Series&quot; by D. M. Cornish (2006–2010), &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; by Hiromu Arakawa (2001–2010), &quot;Terrarch Tetralogy by&quot; William King (2011–), and &quot;The Powder Mage&quot; trilogy, Brian McClellan (2013–2015), &quot;The Shadow Campaigns&quot; (2013–2018) by Django Wexler.

===Medieval fantasy===

Medieval fantasy encompasses works where aspects of medieval history such as legends from the Middle Ages, and aesthetics such as medievalisms, overlap with fantasy. According to the Getty Museum, it is contrasted from folklore which is set in a &quot;familiar world with stock characters and plots&quot;. Subgenres of fantasy such as Gothic fiction, sword and sorcery, fairy tales, high fantasy, and low fantasy, can also overlap with medieval fantasy.

The broad genre of medieval fantasy is common among role-playing games and high fantasy literature. Notable examples of medieval fantasy games the Getty Museum has listed include the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series (1986-) and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974). Examples of literature listed include the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (1954-1955) and &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; (1996-).

===Prehistoric fantasy===
Stories set in prehistoric times and depicting the lives of prehistoric people. Prehistoric fantasy examples include the &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; series by Jean M. Auel (1980-2011) and the &quot;Chronicles of Ancient Darkness&quot; by Michelle Paver.

===Wuxia===

Wǔxiá, literally meaning &quot;martial (arts) heroes&quot;, is a subgenre of the quasi-fantasy and martial arts genre in literature, television and cinema. Wǔxiá figures prominently in the popular culture of Chinese-speaking areas, and the most important writers have devoted followings.

The wǔxiá genre is a blend of the philosophy of xiá (俠, &quot;honor code&quot;, &quot;an ethical person&quot;, &quot;a hero&quot;), and China&#x27;s long history in wǔshù (&quot;kung fu&quot; or &quot;martial arts&quot;). A martial artist who follows the code of xiá is called a swordsman, or xiákè (俠客/侠客, literally &quot;chivalrous guest&quot;). Japan&#x27;s samurai bushidō traditions, England&#x27;s knight chivalry traditions, and America&#x27;s gunslinger Western traditions all share some aspects with China&#x27;s swordsman xiá traditions. The swordsman, however, need not serve a lord or hold any military power and they are not required to be from an aristocratic class.

<doc id="722620" wikidata="Q2736135" url="?curid=722620" title="Telithromycin">
<text>Telithromycin is the first ketolide antibiotic to enter clinical use and is sold under the brand name of Ketek. It is used to treat community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity. After significant safety concerns, the US Food and Drug Administration sharply curtailed the approved uses of the drug in early 2007.

Telithromycin is a semi-synthetic erythromycin derivative. It is created by substituting a ketogroup for the cladinose sugar and adding a carbamate ring in the lactone ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the oxygen at the 6 position is methylated, as is the case with clarithromycin, to achieve better acid-stability.
It was patented in 1994 and approved for medical use in 2001.

== Adverse effects ==
Most common side-effects are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Headache and disturbances in taste also occur. Less common side-effects include palpitations, blurred vision, and rashes. Prolonged QTc intervals may also be caused by telithromycin.

Rare but severe side-effects were initially reported in March 2006, involving damage to the liver. Three different incidents were reported: one case of temporary drug-induced hepatitis, one ending in a liver transplant, and one ending in death.

In the United States, the FDA&#x27;s Office of Epidemiology and Surveillance identified 12 cases of acute liver failure, resulting in four deaths, and an additional 23 cases of acute, serious liver injury, among 5.2 million patients taking telithromycin through April 2006.

In 2010, a published report described the likely mechanism of action underlying not only the cases of liver failure but also cases of visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. The study showed that a pyridine moiety that is part of the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver. Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, solithromycin, do not contain the pyridine moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.

== Mechanism of action ==
Telithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Telithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and blocks the progression of the growing polypeptide chain. Telithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, telithromycin strongly bind simultaneously to two domains of 23S RNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, where older macrolides bind strongly only to one domain and weakly to the second domain. Like many other protein synthesis inhibitors, telithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and 30S.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Unlike erythromycin, telithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally while being protected from gastric acids. It is fairly rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, telithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of telithromycin is released. The concentration of telithromycin in the tissues is much higher than in plasma. Telithromycin fulfills a role that has arisen due to the rise of microbial resistance to existing macrolides and appears to be effective against macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The defining differentiating characteristic of the ketolides as opposed to other macrolides is the removal of the neutral sugar, L-cladinose from the 3 position of the macrolide ring and the subsequent oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a 3-keto functional group.

== Metabolism ==
Telithromycin is metabolized mainly in the liver, the main elimination route being the bile, a small portion is also excreted into the urine. About one third is excreted unchanged in bile and urine, the biliary route being favoured. Telithromycin&#x27;s half-life is approximately ten hours.

== History ==

French pharmaceutical company Hoechst Marion Roussel (later Sanofi-Aventis) began phase II/III clinical trials of telithromycin (HMR-3647) in 1998. Telithromycin was approved by the European Commission in July 2001 and subsequently went on sale in October 2001. In the US, telithromycin received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on April 1, 2004.

===Safety controversies and fraud===
FDA staffers publicly complained that safety problems and some data integrity issues were ignored prior to approval, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings to examine these complaints. One doctor went to prison because she falsified data in her portion of the clinical trials (about 400 patients out of 24,000). Further, Ketek seemed to cause liver problems, including &quot;liver failure&quot;, to a greater extent than would be expected of a common-use antibiotic. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings.

Study 3014 was a key clinical trial of approximately 24,000 patients which Sanofi-Aventis submitted to the FDA to seek approval for Ketek. The doctor who treated the most patients in Study 3014 (about 400), Maria &quot;Anne&quot; Kirkman Campbell, served a 57-month sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud, by defrauding Aventis and others. The indictment states that Campbell fabricated data she sent to the company. Documents, including internal Sanofi-Aventis emails show that Aventis was worried about Campbell early in study 3014 but didn&#x27;t tell the FDA until the agency&#x27;s own inspectors discovered the problem independently.

In January 2006, an article in the March issue of &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; was published, citing three recent drug-induced liver injury cases likely due to telithromycin, one resulting in a liver transplant and one in death.

In July 2006, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, unpublished e-mails from FDA safety official David Graham argued telithromycin had not been proven safe, that safer drugs were available for the same indications, and that the approval was a mistake and should be immediately withdrawn.

Between the start of telithromycin&#x27;s marketing in mid-2004 and September 2006, there were 13 cases of liver failure, including at least four deaths, vision problems, blackouts, syncope, and potentially fatal cases of myasthenia gravis. &quot;The Times&quot; said that the FDA was embroiled in a &quot;fierce battle&quot; over the approval, fueled by exposure in the press. Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman, Senate Finance Committee), Representatives Edward J. Markey (D-Mass) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif) held hearings.

===FDA Warning===
On February 12, 2007, after an advisory committee discussion and vote in December 2006, the FDA announced a revision to the labeling of Ketek. The changes included the removal of two of the three previously approved indications: acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The agency determined that the balance of benefits and risks no longer supported approval of the drug for these indications. Ketek remained on the market for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia of mild to moderate severity (acquired outside of hospitals or long-term care facilities). In addition, the FDA worked with the manufacturer to update the product labeling with a &quot;black box warning,&quot; their strongest form of warning. Ketek&#x27;s warning states that it should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease that causes muscle weakness. Following this decision, Sanofi-Aventis withdrew the drug from active sales in the United States.

== Available forms ==
Telithromycin is administered as tablets. The standard dosing is two 400 mg tablets to be taken together daily, with or without food.

<text>The 1st (United Kingdom) Division is an active division of the British Army that has been formed and disestablished numerous times between 1809 and the present. In its original incarnation as the 1st Division, it took part in the Peninsular War—part of the Coalition Wars of the Napoleonic Wars—and was disbanded in 1814 but was re-formed the following year for service in the War of the Seventh Coalition and fought at the Battle of Waterloo. It remained active as part of the British occupation of France until it was disbanded in 1818, when the British military withdrew. The division was then raised as needed; it served in the Crimean War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Boer War. In 1902, the British Army formed several permanent divisions, which included the 1st Division, which fought in the First World War, made various deployments during the interwar period, and took part in the Second World War when it was known as the 1st Infantry Division.

In the post-war period, the division was deployed to Mandatory Palestine on internal security operations during the Jewish insurgency. In 1948, when all British troops left, the division transferred to Tripoli, Libya, which was then under occupation by Anglo-French forces following the conclusion of the Second World War. With rising tensions in Egypt, the division was moved there to defend the Suez Canal. It remained there until 1955, when it was withdrawn to the UK as Britain removed its military from the area. The stay in the UK was short because there was little need for an additional divisional headquarters, and the division was disbanded on 30 June 1960. The following day, it was reformed in Germany as the 1st Division by the renaming of the 5th Division and served as part of the British Army of the Rhine, and helped pioneer new tactics. On 1 April 1978, the name was again changed when the division was converted into an armoured formation and it became the 1st Armoured Division.

The division formed the basis of Operation Granby, the British contribution to the Gulf War in 1991. During a 48-hour period, the formation destroyed 300 Iraqi tanks and captured 7,000 prisoners. It then returned to Germany and was disbanded in 1992 as part of an army restructuring and downsizing that followed the end of the Cold War. In 1993, the formation was reformed when the 4th Armoured Division was redesignated as the 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division. It contributed to various peacekeeping operations during the 1990s. In 2003, the division again returned to the Middle East and formed the basis of Operation Telic, the British contribution to the US-led 2003 Invasion of Iraq. It rapidly achieved the objectives assigned to it, including the capture of the city of Basra. The division was withdrawn after a few months and southern Iraq came under the control of the Multi-National Division (South-East). Over the following years, the division was based in Germany and deployed brigades to the multi-national division in Iraq.

From 2010, the division has undergone several changes following defence reviews and army restructuring progammes. These included Army 2020, Army 2020 Refine, and the Future Soldier programme. As a result, in 2014, the formation was redesignated as the 1st (United Kingdom) Division; with this relabeling, the division transformed from an armoured formation into a light infantry one. The following year, the headquarters moved from Germany to Imphal Barracks, York. It is currently planned for the headquarters to be relocated to Catterick Garrison after 2028.

==Divisional history 1809–1945==

The 1st Division was formed on 18 June 1809 by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of British forces in Spain and Portugal, for service during the Peninsular War—part of the Napoleonic Wars. After the conclusion of the War of the Sixth Coalition, the division was broken up in France and its troops dispersed to the UK or were dispatched to North America to take part in the War of 1812. The division was reformed the following year when the War of the Seventh Coalition began, and it fought at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo. In the latter battle, the division helped repulse the final attack of the day, which the French Imperial Guard had launched. With the end of the war, the division became part of the Army of Occupation based in France, where it remained until December 1818, when it was disbanded upon the British withdrawal and the end of the occupation.

During the mid-to late-19th century, several formations bearing the name 1st Division were formed, each for a particular conflict. According to the division&#x27;s official website, three such formations form part of its lineage: those that fought in the Crimean War (1854–1856), the Anglo-Zulu War (1879), and the Second Boer War (1899–1900). In 1902, the division was reformed as a permanent formation within the British Army and was stationed at Aldershot. During the First World War (1914–1918), it was deployed to France and fought on the Western Front throughout the conflict. In 1918, following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, it marched into Germany and became part of the occupation force the British Army of the Rhine. In March 1919, the 1st Division was redesignated as the Western Division and ceased to exist. It was reformed on 4 June 1919 at Aldershot and was the only division maintained in a state of readiness in the immediate post-war years. Detachments were dispatched to take part in the Irish War of Independence, to reinforce the Occupation of Constantinople, and to help oversee the 1935 Saar status referendum. From September to December 1936, the entire division was deployed to Palestine during the opening stages of the Arab revolt. The majority of its troops were returned to the UK by the end of the year and the remainder returned in 1937. During the Second World War, by which time it was known as the 1st Infantry Division, the formation took part in the Battle of France, the Tunisian campaign, and the Italian campaign. In February 1945, it was transferred from Italy to Palestine and remained there for the final stages of the war.

==Post War and Cold War==
With the exception of the period December 1945–March 1946, when the division moved to Egypt to reorganise, the 1st Infantry Division remained in Palestine until May 1948. During this time, it was assigned to internal security operations during the Jewish insurgency. Its forces were deployed to Haifa and Galilee, and to guard the northern border. As part of the general British withdrawal from Palestine, in May 1948, the division relocated to Tripoli, Libya, which at the time was occupied by Anglo-French forces. In August 1951 during the Korean War, the 1st Commonwealth Division was activated. Due to a lack of troops in the theatre, engineer and signal personnel from the 1st Infantry Division were sent to join the newly formed formation in Korea. The 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s time in Libya lasted until November 1951, when it joined the 80-000-strong British garrison in Egypt. Located in the Ismailia region, it was tasked with the defence of the Suez Canal and British interests in the Middle East. This came shortly after the Egyptian government abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, under which British troops were to remain in the canal area. The ensuing political landscape saw increased animosity to the British presence, eventually resulting in an agreement to withdraw. The division departed for the UK in November 1955 and then formed the British Army&#x27;s strategic reserve. After its return to the UK, the division was used as a source of personnel for formations overseas and was never brought up to full strength. On 30 June 1960, by which point there was no need for an additional divisional headquarters in the UK, the 1st Infantry Division was disbanded.

In Germany on 1 July 1960, the 5th Division was redesignated as the 1st Division and the renamed formation took on the 1st Division&#x27;s lineage and insignia. The division was located at Verden an der Aller, Germany, and formed part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). At the end of the 2000s decade, the formation conducted division-wide trials using the &quot;square brigade&quot; concept. When they were deemed successful in 1970, all brigades within the BAOR were reorganised accordingly In the late 1960s, new anti-tank and defence in depth concepts were developed as fears of a possible surprise attack by the Warsaw Pact grew within the BAOR. Major-General Edwin Bramall promoted these new ideas when he took command of the 1st Division in January 1972. Bramall felt there was an over-reliance on the arrival of reinforcements to resist an offensive by the Soviet Union rather than the BAOR being able to do so itself. Using the division, the new tactics were refined and were later adopted by the BAOR, and further developed at a higher level in the mid-1970s.

==Transition to armoured division==
During the 1970s, the UK had to reconcile its decreased resources with its commitments and the increased threat from the Soviet Union. The 1975 Mason Review, a government white paper, outlined a new defence policy and called for BAOR to be restructured and included the elimination of the brigade level of command. This political change allowed the BAOR to restructure based on the anti-tank concepts the 1st Division had pioneered. As a result, the BAOR increased to four divisions for the first time since the end of the 1950s, with each division composed of two armoured regiments, three mechanised infantry battalions, and two artillery regiments.

On 1 April 1978, the 1st Division was redesignated as the 1st Armoured Division. The division&#x27;s 7th and the 11th Armoured Brigades became defunct, and were replaced by Task Force Alpha and Task Force Bravo. It was intended the division could form up to five battlegroups, each of which would be commanded by either an armoured regiment or an infantry battalion. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces. The reforms intended the divisional commander (general officer commanding (GOC)) would oversee these battlegroups but early training showed this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (wartime strength) and included two brigadiers. They would each command a flexible task force, which the GOC had formed. This approach intended to allow the GOC to tailor his forces to meet unforeseen events and execute the new developed doctrine. Task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure and they had no administrative responsibilities. Structuring the division in this manner allowed for an overall reduction of 700 men. David John Anthony Stone, a historian who wrote about the British Army during the Cold War, said the system was &quot;designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and [to] take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved&quot;.

In 1981, John Nott, the Secretary of State for Defence in the government elected in 1979, announced the 1981 Defence White Paper which, like the Mason Review, aimed to balance spending on the British military with the nation&#x27;s financial resources. Nott&#x27;s paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades into a force of three divisions of three brigades. The intent was to save personnel and money while losing only one divisional headquarters. The task-force concept, which had not met expectations, was dropped and the 1st Armoured Division was reorganised in line with Nott&#x27;s recommendations. It then commanded the 7th, 12th, and 22nd Armoured Brigades. Each brigade contained either two armoured regiments and one mechanised infantry battalion, or two mechanised infantry battalions and one armoured regiment.

On 11 November 1983, the divisional insignia was changed. Major-General Brian Kenny decided to merge the then-current insignia with that used by the Second World War-era 1st Armoured Division. The new insignia combined the extant triangle and red outline with a charging rhino motif. Starting that year, the first Challenger tanks were provided to the BAOR to replace the Chieftain, and all armoured regiments had converted by the end of the decade.

==Gulf War==
===Preparation===
On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded the neighbouring country Kuwait, starting the Gulf War. Iraq then threatened Saudi Arabia, which controlled the then-largest-proven oil reserve. The invasion sparked international outrage and resulted in the formation of a US-led coalition, which dispatched troops to protect Saudi Arabia. The invasion coincided with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the subsequent decreased threat from the Soviet Union, and the ending of the Cold War, which facilitated troop withdrawals from Europe for deployment to the Middle East.

The British role in the conflict was assigned the codename Operation Granby . On 14 September, the UK Government announced the British contingent would be based around the 1st Armoured Division&#x27;s 7th Armoured Brigade. This was intended as a six-month deployment and the brigade replaced with another at the end. The brigade group was 9,500 strong and included 117 Challenger tanks, 101 Warrior infantry fighting vehicles, and 28 artillery pieces. The logistical requirement to maintain this force was deemed to be all existing stocks within the BAOR and over half of the spare parts the BAOR had. This forced the cannibalization of some of the BAOR&#x27;s tanks to obtain the required spares and equipment for the brigade. On 22 November, the decision was made to expand the British contingent to a division-sized force. The 4th Armoured Brigade was committed to join the 7th Armoured Brigade in the Middle East—codenamed Granby 1.5), and the entire force was to be overseen by the 1st Armoured Division. With these two brigades and the attached supporting units, the division was 28,000 strong and had 7,000 vehicles. These included 179 Challenger tanks, 316 Warriors, 79 artillery pieces, 16 M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, in addition to armoured reconnaissance vehicles, anti-tank helicopters, and anti-aircraft weapon systems. This expansion prompted another major effort to obtain the required parts and spares to maintain the force. The majority of the division&#x27;s personnel were flown to Saudi Arabia following a layover at Cyprus. A small number joined the vehicles, which were loaded aboard charted merchant ships and took a roughly two-week journey from Germany to the Middle East. The vehicles were repainted, and once in Saudi Arabia they were modified for desert conditions and up-armoured.

The arriving troops were quartered at Jubail and were assigned to the US I Marine Expeditionary Force. As the force expanded, Lieutenant-General Peter de la Billière, the overall British commander, called for the division to be used in the coming campaign&#x27;s primary effort and not assigned to what was seen as a secondary role. As a result, the 1st Armoured Division joined the US VII Corps in December. On 18 January 1991, the division moved into the desert and underwent training, which included exercises with American forces. In mid-February, alongside VII Corps, the division conducted daily artillery attacks on Iraqi positions across the border.

===Campaign===

On 24 February 1991, VII Corps began the ground campaign and US forces breached Iraqi border positions, allowing the 1st Armoured Division to advance, and it entered Iraq the following day. The final elements of the division crossed into Iraqi territory in the early hours of 26 February. The division&#x27;s objective was to prevent the redeployment of Iraqi mobile forces, to destroy encountered armour and artillery positions, and to seek out and destroy the local tactical reserve that consisted of the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division. Identified and named objectives were based around known Iraqi troop deployments. The capture of territory was not necessarily important so these objectives did not need to be secured as long as Iraqi forces left behind in them had been rendered immobile.

The 7th Armoured Brigade conducted the division&#x27;s first attack at mid-afternoon on 25 February. Four hours later, the 4th Armoured Brigade entered the fray. Sandstorms and rain limited visibility and caused vehicles to engage at closer ranges than expected. The widespread use of thermal and night-vision equipment gave British troops a tactical advantage over Iraqi forces. By dawn on 26 February, the two brigades had overrun the immobile Iraqi 48th Infantry Division and captured its commanding officer, attacked elements of the 31st Infantry Division, and destroyed most of the 52nd Armored Division that had attempted to reinforce the assaulted formations or counterattack the British moves during three engagements. During 26 February, the division advanced towards Wadi al Batin, further isolating the Iraqi VII Corps frontline troops. Several VII Corps reserve positions were assaulted, resulting in the destruction of the remains of the 80th Armored Brigade,of the Iraqi 12th Armored Division, the 25th Infantry Division, the headquarters and logistical base of the 52nd Armoured Division that had previously avoided combat, and several artillery battalions. During the day, US A-10 Thunderbolts destroyed two Warriors in a friendly fire incident. With little organised resistance left between the British troops and the Persian Gulf, the division advanced unopposed for the next two days until it reached the Kuwait City–Basra highway (Highway 80) north of Kuwait City, where it linked up with US and Egyptian forces.

During the campaign, Highway 80 became known as the Highway of Death as coalition aircraft destroyed large numbers of Iraqi vehicles fleeing Kuwait City. The 1st Armoured Division was tasked with clearing the highway; moving vehicles off the road, removing unexploded munitions, rounding up scattered Iraqi troops, searching for wounded personnel and providing them with medical treatment, and burying the dead. By 16 March, the 7th Armoured Brigade had been withdrawn to Al Jubayl and started to return to Germany. Divisional headquarters followed on 23 March, and by early April, only a battalion-sized British formation remained in the theatre.

According to Stephen Alan Bourque, who wrote the history of the US VII Corps during the Gulf War, &quot;in only forty-eight hours ... [the division had] eliminated the greater part of five divisions of the Iraqi VII Corps&quot; and took over 7,000 prisoners. In total, the division inflicted over 4,000 materiel—tanks, APCs, artillery, and other vehicles—losses upon the Iraqi army, which included the destruction of roughly 300 Iraqi main battle tanks. One of these tanks was destroyed from over away, which was the longest-confirmed kill during the conflict. The division largely faced Iraqi forces equipped with the T-55, which was significantly outmatched by the Challenger tank. Overall British casualties—including those from the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and army forces not assigned to the division—were 47. Bourque said the one-sided nature of the fight was due to the ineptness of the Iraqi forces, who undertook &quot;minimal local security&quot;, had &quot;firing positions oriented in the wrong direction, poorly planned artillery fire, and miserable tank gunnery&quot;. He did, however, laud the bravery of the Iraqi tank companies. Patrick Cordingley, who led the 7th Armoured Brigade during the fighting, said the war &quot;was not the clean, high-technology conflict portrayed by the news media. It was dirty, confusing, and bloody. Only training and discipline limited the amount of friendly engagements and presented the illusion of simplicity.&quot;

==End of the Cold War==

Following the defeat of Iraqi and the liberation of Kuwait, the division returned to Germany. Concurrent with the Gulf War was the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. In July 1990, the British government announced a framework called Options for Change, which sought to restructure the British military based on the new strategic situation and allow for further cost-saving measures to be enacted. The size of the military was to be decreased by 18 per cent, equivalent to 56,000 personnel, by the mid-1990s and the BAOR was to be halved. This resulted in the division being disbanded on 31 December 1992 and its headquarters became HQ Lower Saxony District.

Further BAOR restructuring followed and in July 1993, the 4th Armoured Division was redesignated as the 1st (UK) Armoured Division. The reformed division then controlled the 4th, 7th, and 20th Armoured Brigades, each with two mechanised infantry battalions and two Challenger-tank-equipped armoured regiments. The reformed formation maintained the 4th Division&#x27;s HQ presence at Herford and the rest of the division was spread across sites of the Westfalen Garrison area. Starting in the 1990s, elements of the division were regularly hosted in Poland to conduct training exercises. Between 1992 and 1994, the 1st (British) Corps and the BAOR were disbanded and replaced with the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, a newly formed NATO HQ that was administered by the UK. The division came under its command and was deployed on several peacekeeping operations.

In 1995, the Multi-National Division (South-West) was formed by the British Army, to support peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. Forces were drawn from the 1st (UK) Armoured Division and the 3rd (UK) Division, with each headquarters controlling the division as their forces rotated through the command. This lasted until 1999, when force contributions changed and different commanders were selected from outside either division. Other peacekeeping operations included providing troops to Kosovo Force and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. Detachments were also deployed to the Falkland Islands and Northern Ireland. In 1998, the division received the first Challenger 2 tanks, which replaced the earlier model, and they were initial used in Kosovo.

During 2001, Exercise Saif Sareea II was conducted in Oman. This included the division&#x27;s 4th Armoured Brigade with 66 Challenger 2s. The UK government provided no funding to the division to undertake the required desert modifications, such as sand filters, for the tanks, resulting in widespread breakdowns during the exercise.

==Invasion of Iraq==
Following the end of the Gulf War, tensions between Iraq, the US and the UK remained. During the 1990s and early 2000s, a series of attacks occurred as part of the Iraqi no-fly zones conflict. Following the beginning of the War on terror in 2001, the political situation further escalated, culminating in a decision by the US to invade Iraq. In January 2003, because the UK was aligned with the US, the division was assigned as the primary British component of the invasion. The division needed additional infantry so it was reconfigured to consist of the 3rd Commando Brigade (Royal Marines), the 7th Armoured Brigade reinforced with infantry from the 20th Armoured Brigade, the 16th Air Assault Brigade made up of battalions of the Parachute Regiment, and the 102nd Logistical Brigade. By February, the division had assembled in Kuwait, and conducted training and rehearsals through to March. The formation, which was roughly 20,000 strong and had 120 Challenger II tanks, comprised around one third of the US-led invasion force. The division was tasked with securing oil-and-gas infrastructure in southern Iraq, the capture of Basra, and ultimately the securing of the provinces Al-Qādisiyyah, Basra, and Dhi Qar. This area was about half the size of England and Basra province was home to over two million people.

The invasion began on 20 March. Elements of 3rd Commando Brigade, supplemented by the Special Air Service (SAS), the Special Boat Service (SBS), and US Navy Seals immediately secured coastal oil-and-gas facilities and infrastructure, preventing their destruction and environmental damage in the Gulf. For the Royal Marines and SBS, a week-long battle to secure the Al-Faw peninsula followed. The rest of the brigade, supported by US Marines, rapidly secured the Rumaila oil field and only seven of the over-1,000 well heads were destroyed by defending Iraqi forces. US Marines also captured Umm Qasr Port then moved north, leaving the 3rd Commando Brigade to finalise securing the city. With the port secure, the first humanitarian aid arrived on 31 March and was distributed in Umm Qasr. Aid was dispatched to other areas as they came under British control.

The 7th Armoured Brigade and 16th Air Assault Brigade captured additional oil facilities and prevented their destruction before moving towards Basra. The lead elements reached the outskirts within 24 hours and part of the 16th Air Assault Brigade established a roadblock on the main highway from Basra to Baghdad. Zubayr was secured and a loose cordon was established around Basra starting 23 March that aimed to allow Iraqi civilians to leave and to encourage Iraqi troops to desert and flee, and potentially allowed some to fight in the subsequent insurgency. On 26 March, the Iraqi garrison attempted to provoke a British attack by launching a tank assault. In the following one-sided engagement, 15 T-55s were destroyed. British infiltration and raids into the city followed before 6 April, when a large-scale probe was conducted in the northern section of the city. The probe&#x27;s success prompted the deployment of rest of the available division—about 7,000 infantry, 80 tanks, and 100 Warriors—and Basra was secured by nightfall. The only tank loss suffered by the division occurred on 25 March during a friendly fire incident. Three days later, the division suffered additional friendly-fire casualties when they were attacked by the US 190th Fighter Squadron.

With the initial stage of the conflict over, the division took on security-and-stabilisation responsibilities in their assigned area, which was expanded in April to include Maysan, relieving US Marines. On 23 June, the Battle of Majar al-Kabir occurred when divisional patrols consisting of members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment and the Royal Military Police were ambushed, leaving six dead. By May, the majority of the 3rd Commando and 16th Air Assault Brigades had been withdrawn from Iraq. This was followed by the replacement of the 102nd Logistics Brigade with the 101st Logistic Brigade. During June, the 7th Armoured Brigade was replaced with the 19th Mechanised Brigade. On 11 July, the 3rd (UK) Division relieved the divisional headquarters. This was followed by the formation of the Multi-National Division (South-East), which took command of all Multi-National Forces in southern Iraq. The British portion of this force was based around a reinforced brigade, which came from different parent formations and was rotated through several deployments. From November 2003 to April 2004, the 1st (UK) Armoured Division&#x27;s 20th Armoured Brigade was deployed to Iraq under the oversight of the Multi-National Division; the 4th Armoured Brigade was deployed between November 2004–April 2005; the 7th Armoured Brigade was dispatched between October 2005 and May 2006; the 20th Armoured Brigade was again deployed between May and November 2006; the 4th Mechanized Brigade—the renamed and rerolled 4th Armoured Brigade—went to Iraq between December 2007 and June 2008; the 7th Armoured Brigade was deployed between June and December 2008; and the division&#x27;s final deployment, which the Multi-National Division oversaw, was undertaken by the 20th Armoured Brigade between December 2008 and 30 April 2009. This final deployment marked the official end of British combat operations in Iraq, all of which had fallen under Operation Telic.

==Afghanistan==

From 2006 onwards, Task Force Helmand, which was based on a reinforced brigade, was formed to conduct stabilisation-and counterinsurgency missions in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Under the oversight of this task force, the division deployed the 20th Armoured Brigade between October 2011 and April 2012. The next deployment came between October 2013 and June 2014, when the 7th Armoured Brigade was sent to Afghanistan. The final deployment, which coincided with the disbanding of the task force and the British withdrawal from Helmand, was made by the 20th Armoured Brigade between June and December 2014.

==Army 2020==

As with the Gulf War, the division returned to Germany following its time in Iraq and continued to be headquartered at Hereford. While deploying a brigade at a time to Iraq under the oversight of the Multi-National Division (South-East), the 1st (UK) Armoured Division maintained command over the 4th Armoured Brigade based at Osnabruck, the 7th Armoured Brigade at Bergen, and the 20th Armoured Brigade at Paderborn. Combined with the divisional assets and support personnel, the formation was around 17,000 strong. In 2006, following decisions made in the 2003 Delivering Security in a Changing World white paper, the 4th Armoured Brigade was converted into the 4th Mechanized Brigade, a move that decreased the number of its tank regiments and replaced them with infantry battalions. Two years later, the brigade was moved to England and joined the 3rd Division, which reduced the 1st (UK) Armoured Division to a formation of two brigades. By 2013, the 7th Armoured Brigade had relocated to Hohne.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 made a commitment to rebase all remaining British forces stationed in Germany and to move them to the UK. The review also outlined the Army 2020 plan, which aimed to restructure the army from one optimized for the War in Afghanistan to one that was more flexible. This included establishing a Reaction Force and an Adaptable Force, the former of which was to based around the 3rd Division and would contain the army&#x27;s tanks. This force would be primed for short-notice deployments. The Adaptable Force was to be based around the 1st Division, and would be responsible for Britain&#x27;s standing commitments in Brunei, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, public duties, and United Nation peacekeeping, and to support any enduring operations undertaken by the army.

On 21 July 2014, the division was renamed the 1st (United Kingdom) Division. The redesignation, part of the Army 2020 changes, was the start of the division&#x27;s restructure from an armoured formation to one that consisted of light infantry, and the start of its role in the Adaptable Force. On 2 June 2015, the divisional headquarters moved from Germany to Imphal Barracks, York. Upon its reorganisation, the division consisted of the 4th Infantry Brigade—previously the 4th Mechanized and the 15th (North East) Brigades—and was based at Catterick Garrison); the 7th infantry Brigade—the previous 7th Armoured Brigade&#x27;s headquarters merged with the 49th (Eastern) Brigade—and was based at Chetwynd Barracks, Chilwell); the 11th Infantry Brigade at Aldershot Garrison; the 38th (Irish) Brigade at Thiepval Barracks, Lisburn; the 42nd Infantry Brigade at Fulwood Barracks, Preston; the 51st Infantry Brigade at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh; the 102nd Logistic Brigade at Prince William of Gloucester Barracks, Grantham; and the 160th Infantry Brigade at The Barracks, Brecon.

Further changes occurred following the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, resulting in Army 2020 Refine, which was implemented in 2019. The division then consisted of the 4th, 7th, 11th, and 51st Infantry Brigades, as well as the 2nd Medical Brigade at Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Strensall; 8th Engineer Brigade at Gibraltar Barracks, Minley; the 102nd Logistical Brigade; and the 104th Logistical Brigade at Duke of Gloucester Barracks, South Cerney. The role of the division was also expanded to &quot;provide more strategic choice and a range of capabilities, conducting capacity building, stabilisation operations, disaster relief and UK resilience operations&quot;. In December 2020, the 1st Military Police Brigade joined the division.

== Future Soldier ==
Under the 2021 Future Soldier programme, additional organisational changes were made. The divisional headquarters will relocate to Catterick but this move will not take place before 2028. Under this programme, the division was re-organised as such:

* 4th Light Brigade Combat Team (Cottesmore)
* 7th Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team (Catterick)
* 8th Engineer Brigade (Minley)
* 11th Security Force Assistance Brigade (Aldershot)
* 19th Brigade (York)
* 102 Operational Sustainment Brigade (Grantham; brigade HQ will move to York in 2024, then on to Catterick in 2029)
* 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, Intelligence Corps (Catterick)
* 5th Military Intelligence Battalion, Intelligence Corps (Edinburgh)
* 2nd Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (York, then will move to Catterick but not before 2028)
* 37th Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (Redditch)
Following the Future Soldier transformation, at DSEI 2023, General Patrick Sanders announced changes to the structure of the division, such as: &quot;1st (UK) Division taking 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team under its command and becoming a land component command of a joint and multi-domain sovereign Global Response Force (GRF) by 2024.&quot;

In 2024, 8th Engineer Brigade was resubordinated to HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps.

The current structure of the division is now as follows:

* 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team (Colchester)
* 4th Light Brigade Combat Team (Cottesmore)
* 7th Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team (Catterick)
* 19th Brigade (York)
* 102 Operational Sustainment Brigade (Grantham; brigade HQ will move to York in 2024, then on to Catterick in 2029)
* 1st Military Intelligence Battalion, Intelligence Corps (Catterick)
* 5th Military Intelligence Battalion, Intelligence Corps (Edinburgh)
* 2nd Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (York, then will move to Catterick but not before 2028)
* 37th Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals (Redditch)

<text>Made In Heaven is the fifteenth and final studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 6 November 1995 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and by Hollywood Records in the United States. It was the band&#x27;s first and only album released solely under the name &quot;Queen&quot; after the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991. Following Mercury&#x27;s death, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bass guitarist John Deacon worked with vocal and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, adding new instrumentation to the recordings. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury&#x27;s death, were completed at the band&#x27;s studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK, where it went quadruple platinum selling 1.2 million copies. 500,000 copies were shipped in the United States.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Queen released one single in 1997 and subsequently went inactive until 2004 when May and Taylor reunited and started touring with Bad Company frontman Paul Rodgers and later with Adam Lambert; Deacon retired from music in 1997 and has not taken part in any Queen activity since then.

The cover for the album has two different photos: the CD cover photo was shot at dusk, depicting Irena Sedlecká&#x27;s Mercury sculpture located at Lake Geneva in Montreux, Switzerland, on the front, with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the Alps on the rear cover; meanwhile, the LP cover photo was shot in the same spot at dawn, depicting the same statue on the front but with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the sunrise on the rear cover.
==Background and recording==

The album was recorded in a much different way from Queen&#x27;s other studio albums. In early 1991, having completed work on &quot;Innuendo&quot;, and some months before his death, Freddie Mercury recorded as many vocals as he could, with the instruction to the rest of the band (Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon) to complete the songs later. Put to tape during this time were primarily &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Mother Love&quot; and what would eventually become &quot;You Don&#x27;t Fool Me&quot;.

In the documentary &quot; Champions of the World&quot;, May described these sessions with Mercury as such:
Producer David Richards also added:
After Mercury&#x27;s death, the band returned to the studio in 1993 to begin work on finishing the tracks. May has described in interviews that Taylor and Deacon had begun some work in 1992, while May was on tour promoting his &quot;Back to the Light&quot; album. Upon his return in 1993, May felt they were not on the right path with the music and they more or less started from scratch with the three of them working together with producer David Richards.

With less than an album&#x27;s worth to work with, the band decided to revisit previously recorded material. The band did not discuss whether Mercury had any input before his death regarding which songs might be considered. The idea was to take existing songs on which Mercury sang and rework them as Queen songs.

In 2013, Brian May said about the album &quot;[&quot;Made in Heaven&quot;] was possibly the best Queen album we ever made. It has so much beauty in it. It was a long, long process, painstakingly put together. A real labour of love.&quot;

==Songs==
===&quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot;===
Years before Mercury started recording solo material, he created a sound clip of himself experimenting on the piano at Musicland Studios in Munich in 1980 during the sessions of &quot;The Game&quot;. Later, for the use of this album, the song was extended to two minutes and 32 seconds. The more classical section, without Mercury&#x27;s improvisation, was put together by John Deacon. Near the end, a short orchestral sample from the coda of &quot;La Calinda&quot; by English composer Frederick Delius can clearly be heard.

===&quot;Made in Heaven&quot;===

Originally from Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;, this song, along with the other Mercury solo track &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;, was reworked to a &quot;Queen sound&quot; and Mercury&#x27;s original vocals were placed over the new music. In an interview with &quot;Far Out&quot;, May called the song one of his favourite Queen tracks.
===&quot;Let Me Live&quot;===

&quot;Let Me Live&quot; is a rock ballad, which features a rare sharing of the vocals between Mercury, May, and Taylor. This track was originally recorded with Rod Stewart during sessions for the 1984 album &quot;The Works&quot;. Once finished in 1995 for &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, Queen made one 11th-hour change to the song to avoid legal action. Part of the backing vocals featured lyrics too closely resembling Erma Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;. The potentially problematic section was mixed out and the track was released. Promo cassettes from the US feature the unaltered backing track. Early Mexican and Dutch CD pressings are reported to have this alternate version as well.

===&quot;Mother Love&quot;===

&quot;Mother Love&quot; was the final song co-written by Mercury and May, and was also Mercury&#x27;s last vocal performance. Mercury&#x27;s vocals for &quot;Mother Love&quot; were recorded 13–16 May 1991. On his website, May discussed the writing process he and Mercury had (writing both separately and together, and conscious of the nature of the song and the lyrics). Upon reaching the final verse, Mercury told May that he had to go and &quot;have a rest&quot;, but that he would return later and finish it. Mercury never made it back to the studio due to his worsening condition, thus May sang the last verse on the track.

The song features a sample of the vocal improvisation from Queen&#x27;s famous 12 July 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium, and a sample from the intro of the studio version of &quot;One Vision&quot; and &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;. It also features a sample from a cover of &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;, a song written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, for which Mercury had provided lead vocals in 1972. The cover was released as a B-side to &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;, a Ronettes cover, by Larry Lurex (a pseudonym of Mercury&#x27;s), not long before the release of Queen&#x27;s debut album. The sound bursts between the sing along and the &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; sample are apparently a few milliseconds of every Queen track ever recorded, put together, and then rapidly sped through a tape machine. At the very end of the song, a baby is heard crying. This video is age-restricted on YouTube.

===&quot;My Life Has Been Saved&quot;===
&quot;My Life Has Been Saved&quot; was started as an acoustic track composed mainly by Deacon in 1987–1988. Producer David Richards helped him out doing the demo and the keyboards, then Mercury sang on it, and later on the entire band recorded it. The &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; version is different from that of 1989 (which originally featured as the B-side to the single &quot;Scandal&quot;), although it uses the same vocals from Mercury. Deacon plays guitar and keyboards as well as his usual instrument, bass guitar.

===&quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;===

&quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot; was originally recorded (piano, vocals, synths) by Mercury on 25 May 1984, for his &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; album, as a late addition (when told by the record company that the album needed &quot;a single&quot;). May, Taylor and Deacon re-recorded it and added their instruments, turning the song into fast-paced rock, mainly featuring hard rock guitar from May. That track became popular in Japan during 2004 when it was used for the theme song of a television drama named &quot;Pride&quot; (プライド). This version also contains samples of Mercury&#x27;s ad-lib vocals from &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, from the 1986 album of the same name, and from &quot;Living on My Own&quot;, from his &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; album. The music video for this version of the song, also made in 2004, is composed mainly of clips from the Mercury solo video and from &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;===

&quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot; is a track Taylor wrote and tried out with Queen in 1987, although according to some sources it was written with Joan Armatrading in mind to sing it. Whether she turned it down or Taylor withdrew the song is unclear, but it was recorded by his other band The Cross. One night Mercury came to visit The Cross at the studio and after some drinks he gave them ideas of how to sing the song and ended up recording the lead vocals for it. Mercury appeared on the UK version of their album &quot;Shove It&quot; as guest lead vocalist on the song, with Taylor doing backing vocals. The roles were reversed on the single and the American version of &quot;Shove It&quot;. Mercury&#x27;s vocals were then used for the &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; release, with a couple of different lines and May singing backing vocals instead of Taylor, with Richards adding several arrangement ideas. It was released as the leading single two weeks before the album&#x27;s release, with the song&#x27;s music video commemorating Mercury, and also containing footage of Georges Méliès seminal 1902 silent film &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;.

===&quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot;===

&quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; was composed by May, Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers sometime between the sessions for &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Miracle&quot;. They wrote it in the US and Mercury sang on it. However, there were some problems with the companies representing publishing rights for Musker and Lamers so they could not release the song properly on &quot;The Miracle&quot;. The song even appears in the original track listing between &quot;I Want It All&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, but was deleted. This is the only track on the &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; album which wasn&#x27;t reworked by the remaining members of the band during 1993–1995 sessions, as it is the original 1989 mix prepared for &quot;The Miracle&quot;.

At &quot;The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert&quot;, May played the song on piano and sang it for the first time in public and then released it as part of his solo album &quot;Back to the Light&quot;. Its arrangement differs to the Queen version, featuring acoustic guitar solo and no drums. However May played this track live with his touring band in 1992–1993 using an arrangement similar to the original Queen version. The song was awarded Best Song Musically and Lyrically at the 1997 Novello Awards.

This song was also performed by Queen and Luciano Pavarotti in 2003, with Pavarotti singing the latter parts of the verses in Italian.

===&quot;You Don&#x27;t Fool Me&quot;===

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Fool Me&quot; was one of the last tracks recorded for &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;. May has explained on his website that producer David Richards more or less created the framework of the song single-handedly, building from bits of lyrics recorded just before Mercury&#x27;s death. May has said that before Richards&#x27; work, there was no song to speak of. However, after Richards edited and mixed the song (including a bit of harmonies recorded for &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;) he presented it to the band. May, Taylor and Deacon then added their instruments and backing vocals and were surprised to end up with a finished song that had begun as nothing. The style of the song is reminiscent of their 1982 album &quot;Hot Space&quot;, and a comment over that featured on their &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot; album.

===&quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;===

&quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a ballad written and composed by Mercury at his apartment in Montreux, Switzerland. It is the last complete song Mercury composed on his own (the music for &quot;Mother Love&quot; is by May).
It has been branded as one of few Christmas songs from the band, along with &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;.

The vocals were laid down months before Mercury&#x27;s death and the band completed the backing track sometime after. According to the liner notes in the 2011 release, the band finished the song how they thought Mercury would have wanted it.

===&quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day (Reprise)&quot;===
A heavier rock version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot;, that is the same in the beginning but later turns into rock. It contains &quot;Yeah&quot; and samples from &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;.

===&quot;Yeah&quot;===
&quot;Yeah&quot; is the shortest song on the album and in Queen&#x27;s song catalogue, lasting only four seconds. It consists solely of Mercury saying the word &quot;yeah&quot;. The origin of the vocal snippet is most commonly attributed to a backing vocal during the second chorus of &quot;Action This Day&quot; from &quot;Hot Space,&quot; though similarity has been noted to the vocal in the intro of &quot;Don&#x27;t Try Suicide&quot; from &quot;The Game.&quot;

===&quot;13/Untitled&quot;===
Running at 22 minutes and 32 seconds, &quot;13&quot; began as an experiment by Richards with an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler. He took the opening chords of &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot; and made them loop, and then added Mercury&#x27;s voice saying &quot;are you running?&quot;, Mercury laughing and at the very end Mercury saying &quot;fab&quot;, through strange echoes. May and Taylor also added some ideas to the track. This track was previously only available on the CD edition of the album and the aforementioned promo cassettes. This is also the longest track Queen had ever made.

Standard cassettes of the album end with the shortened &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day (Reprise)&quot;, fading out after Track 12 (&quot;Yeah&quot;), where this untitled track would continue on. 

The LP (vinyl) edition of the album has only the first few seconds, which run into the run-off of the groove on the record, which means that if a listener has a record player which does not have an automatic stop activated at this point, said notes will play indefinitely.

The album&#x27;s last listed track (all formats) is track 11: &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day (Reprise)&quot;. In 2015, upon the re-issuing of Queen&#x27;s discography on vinyl, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; was re-issued as a double disc set with track 13 taking up the entirety of side D. The track was given the name &quot;13&quot; and is listed on the artwork.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Made in Heaven&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Critics praised its upbeat nature and quality of music after the death of Mercury.
&quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Ten new tracks (and one reprise). No filler. No shame. An essential purchase for Queen fans, certainly, but even without its special significance, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; is probably a better album than &quot;Innuendo&quot; and a fitting swan song by one of the most incandescent groups in rock. &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; is also the last musical will and testament of a star who was never going to be turned into a saint, but whose grandstanding performances were, right to the very end, always marked by reckless enthusiasm and a rare generosity of spirit.&quot;

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described the album as &quot;essential listening&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s the perfect theatrical epitaph for a life dedicated to gorgeous artifice.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;When a band have the controls permanently set at full-tilt, as Queen did, burn-out is inevitable, for the listener, if not for the band. When we eventually reach the drum-crashing finale, &#x27;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&#x27;, which kicks in with Mercury&#x27;s umpteenth randy-rottweiler howl, it feels as if far more than 70 minutes has passed. That&#x27;s where the aforesaid lyrics save the day. Predominantly written by Mercury, they are effectively farewell notes. He poured out his heart, and his words have a throat-aching poignance. Even the record&#x27;s opening verse assumes a painful significance.&quot;

&quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Somehow Mercury and Queen&#x27;s ability to make a joyful noise in the face of pain and death makes this a very comforting album to have around in shaky times.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; stated: &quot;[There are not] any obviously half-baked, or patched-up numbers. Most, however, are as good as anything that Queen came up with in their later years. How good that is, as always with Queen, is largely a matter of taste. &#x27;Mother Love&#x27;, the last recording that Mercury made, is a song of truly heartfelt pathos. Despite its overdue delivery, &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; stands up remarkably well as the closing chapter in a spectacular pop odyssey.&quot;

AllMusic wrote: &quot;&quot;Made in Heaven&quot; harked back to Queen&#x27;s 1970s heyday with its strong melodies and hard rock guitar playing, topped by Mercury&#x27;s bravura singing and some of the massed choir effects familiar from &#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27;. Even if one did not know that these songs were sung in the shadow of death, that subject would be obvious. The lyrics were imbued with life-and-death issues, from the titles. The odd thing about this was that Mercury&#x27;s over-the-top singing had always contained a hint of camp humour, and it continued to here, even when the sentiments clearly were as heartfelt as they were theatrically overstated. Maybe Mercury was determined to go out the same way he had come in, as a diva. If so, he succeeded.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Popular culture===
The album inspired the makers of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series of video games to have certain characters in the game, such as Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield, wear jackets/vests with the words &#x27;Made in Heaven&#x27; written on the back, with Chris’ jacket as part of an unlockable outfit from the first game, and Claire as part of her default outfit from the second game. Claire would also wear a vest with the legend &#x27;Let Me Live&#x27; on the back for a later game in the series. The male lead of &quot;Resident Evil 0&quot;, Billy Coen, has an arm-length tattoo which says &#x27;Mother Love&#x27;, another song from the album. 

It was also the name of Enrico Pucci&#x27;s final Stand in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean&quot;.

<text>In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Tellus, Terra or Tierra (&quot;Mother Earth&quot;) is the personification of the Earth. Although Tellus and Terra are hardly distinguishable during the Imperial era, &quot;Tellus&quot; was the name of the original earth goddess in the religious practices of the Republic or earlier. The scholar Varro (1st century BC) lists Tellus as one of the &quot;di selecti&quot;, the twenty principal gods of Rome, and one of the twelve agricultural deities. She is regularly associated with Ceres in rituals pertaining to the earth and agricultural fertility.

The attributes of Tellus were the cornucopia, bunches of flowers, or fruit. She was typically depicted reclining, or rising, waist high from a hole in the ground. Her male complement was a sky god such as Caelus (Uranus) or a form of Jupiter. Her Greek counterpart is Gaia, and among the Etruscans, her name was Cel. Michael Lipka has argued that the &quot;Terra Mater&quot; who appeared during the reign of Augustus, is a direct transfer of the Greek &quot;Ge Mater&quot; into Roman religious practice, while Tellus, whose ancient temple was within Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary (&quot;pomerium&quot;), represents the original earth goddess cultivated by the state priests.

==Name==

The two words &quot;terra&quot; and &quot;tellus&quot; are thought to derive from the formulaic phrase &quot;tersa tellus&quot;, meaning &quot;dry land&quot;. The etymology of &quot;tellus&quot; is uncertain; it is perhaps related to Sanskrit &quot;talam&quot;, &quot;plain ground&quot;.
The 4th century AD Latin commentator Servius distinguishes between use of &quot;tellus&quot; and &quot;terra&quot;. &quot;Terra&quot;, he says, is properly used of the &quot;elementum&quot;, earth as one of the four classical elements with air (&quot;Ventus&quot;), water (&quot;Aqua&quot;), and fire (&quot;Ignis&quot;). &quot;Tellus&quot; is the goddess, whose name can be substituted (&quot;ponimus ... pro&quot;) for her functional sphere the earth, just as the name &quot;Vulcanus&quot; is used for fire, &quot;Ceres&quot; for produce, and &quot;Liber&quot; for wine. &quot;Tellus&quot; thus refers to the guardian deity of Earth and by extension the globe itself. Tellus may be an aspect of the spirit called Dea Dia by the Arval priests, or at least a close collaborator with her as &quot;divinity of the clear sky.&quot;

Varro identifies &quot;Terra Mater&quot; with Ceres:

Not without cause was the Earth (&quot;Terra&quot;) called &quot;Mater&quot; and &quot;Ceres&quot;. It was believed that those who cultivated her led a pious and useful life (&quot;piam et utilem ... vitam&quot;), and that they were the sole survivors from the line of King Saturn.

Ovid distinguishes between Tellus as the &quot;locus&quot; (&quot;site, location&quot;) of growth, and Ceres as its &quot;causa&quot; (&quot;cause, agent&quot;). &quot;Mater&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;mother,&quot; is often used as an honorific for goddesses, including Vesta, who was represented as a virgin. &quot;Mother&quot; therefore is an honorific that expresses the respect one would owe any good mother. Tellus and Terra are both regarded as mothers in both the literal and honorific sense; Vesta in the honorific only.

==Temple==
The Temple of Tellus was the most prominent landmark of the Carinae, a fashionable neighborhood on the Oppian Hill. It was near homes (&quot;domūs&quot;) belonging to Pompey and to the Cicero family.

The temple was the result of a &quot;votum&quot; made in 268 BC by Publius Sempronius Sophus when an earthquake struck during a battle with the Picenes. Others say it was built by the Roman people. It occupied the former site of a house belonging to Spurius Cassius, which had been torn down when he was executed in 485 BC for attempting to make himself king. The temple constructed by Sophus more than two centuries later was most likely a rebuilding of the people&#x27;s. The anniversary (&quot;dies natalis&quot;) of its dedication was December 13.

A mysterious object called the &quot;magmentarium&quot; was stored in the temple, which was also known for a representation of Italy on the wall, either a map or an allegory.

A statue of Quintus Cicero, set up by his brother Marcus, was among those that stood on the temple grounds. Cicero claims that the proximity of his property caused some Romans to assume he had a responsibility to help maintain the temple.

==Festivals==

Festivals celebrated for Tellus were mainly concerned with agriculture and often connected with Ceres. In January, both goddesses were honored as &quot;mothers of produce&quot; at the moveable feast (&quot;feriae conceptivae&quot;) of Sementivae, a festival of sowing. On December 13, the anniversary of the Temple of Tellus was celebrated along with a &quot;lectisternium&quot; (banquet) for Ceres, who embodied &quot;growing power&quot; and the productivity of the earth.

Tellus received the sacrifice of a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia, a festival pertaining to fertility and animal husbandry held April 15, in the middle of the Cerialia (April 12–19). Festivals for deities of vegetation and the earth cluster in April on the Roman calendar. The institution of the Fordicidia was attributed to Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome. During a time when Rome was struggling with harsh agricultural conditions, Numa was instructed by the rustic god Faunus in a dream that a sacrifice to Tellus was needed. As is often the case with oracles, the message required interpretation:
&quot;By the death of cattle, oh King, Tellus must be placated: two cows, that is. Let a single heifer yield two lives (&quot;animae&quot;) for the rites.&quot; Numa solved the riddle by instituting the sacrifice of a pregnant cow. The purpose of the sacrifice, as suggested by the Augustan poet Ovid and by the 6th-century antiquarian John Lydus, was to assure the fertility of the planted grain already growing in the womb of Mother Earth in the guise of Tellus. This public sacrifice was conducted in the form of a holocaust on behalf of the state at the Capitol, and also by each of the thirty &quot;curiae&quot;, the most ancient divisions of the city made by Romulus from the original three tribes. The state sacrifice was presided over by the Vestals, who used the ash from the holocaust to prepare &quot;suffimen&quot;, a ritual substance used later in April for the Parilia.

During the Secular Games held by Augustus in 17 BC, Terra Mater was among the deities honored in the Tarentum in the Campus Martius. Her ceremonies were conducted by &quot;Greek rite&quot; (&quot;ritus graecus&quot;), distinguishing her from the Roman Tellus whose temple was within the &quot;pomerium&quot;. She received the holocaust of a pregnant sow. The Secular Games of 249 BC had been dedicated to the underworld deities Dis pater and Proserpina, whose underground altar was in the Tarentum. Under Augustus, the Games (&quot;ludi&quot;) were dedicated to seven other deities, invoked as the &quot;Moerae, Iuppiter, Ilithyia, Iuno, Terra Mater, Apollo&quot; and &quot;Diana&quot;.

==Prayers and rituals==
The &quot;sacrum ceriale&quot; (&quot;cereal rite&quot;) was carried out for Tellus and Ceres by a flamen, probably the Flamen Cerialis, who also invoked twelve male helper gods. According to Varro, the two goddesses jointly received the &quot;porca praecidanea&quot;, a pig sacrificed in advance of the harvest. Some rites originally pertaining to Tellus may have been transferred to Ceres, or shared with her, as a result of her identification with Greek Demeter.

Tellus was felt to be present during rites of passage, either implicitly, or invoked. She was perhaps involved in the ceremonies attending the birth of a child, as the newborn was placed on the ground immediately after coming into the world. Tellus was also invoked at Roman weddings.

Dedicatory inscriptions to either Tellus or Terra are relatively few, but epitaphs during the Imperial period sometimes contain formulaic expressions such as &quot;Terra Mater, receive me.&quot; In the provincial mining area of Pannonia, at present-day Ljubija, votive inscriptions record dedications to Terra Mater from &quot;vilici&quot;, imperial slave overseers who ran operations at ore smelting factories (&quot;ferrariae&quot;).

These are all dated April 21, when the founding day (&quot;dies natalis,&quot; &quot;birthday&quot;) of Rome was celebrated, perhaps reflecting the connection between the Parilia on April 21 and the Fordicidia as a feast of Tellus. The emperor Septimius Severus restored a temple of Terra Mater at Rudnik, a silver mining area of Moesia Superior. Measuring 30 by 20 meters, the temple was located at the entrance to the work zone.

==Iconography==
Tellus is often identified as the central figure on the so-called &quot;Italia&quot; relief panel of the Ara Pacis, which is framed by &quot;bucrania&quot; (ornamental ox heads) and motifs of vegetative and animal fertility and abundance. Terra long remained common as a personification, if not exactly treated as a goddess. She often formed part of sets of the personified Four Elements, typically identified by a cornucopia, farm animals, and vegetable products.

==Tellumo==
Male counterparts named &quot;Tellumo&quot; or &quot;Tellurus&quot; are mentioned, although rarely. Augustine of Hippo identified Tellumo as the male counterpart of Tellus. A Tellurus is named by Capella but by no other source.

==In science==
In several modern Romance languages, &quot;Terra&quot; or &quot;Terre&quot; is the name of planet Earth. Earth is sometimes referred to as &quot;Terra&quot; by speakers of English to match post-classical Latin astronomical naming conventions, and to distinguish the planet from the soil covering part of it. It is also, rarely, called &quot;Tellus&quot;, mainly via the adjective &quot;&quot;.

<text>Sir Āpirana Turupa Ngata (3 July 1874 – 14 July 1950) was a prominent New Zealand . He has often been described as the foremost Māori politician to have served in parliament in the mid-20th century, and is also known for his work in promoting and protecting Māori culture and language. His legacy is one of the most prominent of any New Zealand leader in the 20th century, and is commemorated by his depiction on the fifty dollar note.

Ngata practised as a lawyer before entering politics in 1897, when he established the Young Māori Party alongside numerous alumni of Te Aute College, including future fellow cabinet minister Māui Pōmare. Here he challenged the traditional views of his people, advocating the abandonment of some traditional practices and customary healing in favour of science and Pākehā-style sanitation, which made him a controversial figure. In 1905, he was elected the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastern Maori, retaining this seat for nearly 40 years.

He served in government as Minister of Native Affairs from 1928 to 1934. In this he tried to accomplish as many reforms for Māori as possible, although he was forced to resign as minister in a widely publicised spending scandal. Nevertheless, he continued to serve as MP for Eastern Maori until he was ousted in 1943 by Rātana candidate (affiliated with Labour) Tiaki Omana, as Labour swept the Māori electorates. At the age of 69 he returned to his Ngāti Porou home 129 kilometres north of Gisborne, where he lived with his four sons and four daughters, and multiple grandchildren, until his death seven years later.

==Early life==
Ngata was born in Te Araroa (then called Kawakawa), a small coastal town about north of Gisborne, New Zealand. His iwi was Ngāti Porou. His father was Paratene Ngata, a tribal leader and expert in traditional lore, and his mother was Katerina Naki, the daughter of an itinerant Scot, Abel Enoch. Ngata was greatly influenced both by his father and by his great-uncle Ropata Wahawaha (who had led loyal kūpapa Ngāti Porou forces against their Pai Mārire enemy (commonly known as Hauhau) in the East Cape War and later Te Kooti&#x27;s escapees from the Chatham Islands). Ngata was raised in a Māori environment, speaking the Māori language, but his father also ensured that Ngata learnt about the Pākehā world, believing that this understanding would be of benefit to Ngāti Porou.

Ngata attended Waiomatatini Native School before moving on to Te Aute College until 1890. Ngata then went to Canterbury University College (now the University of Canterbury), where he studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree, awarded in 1893. From there he went to Auckland, where he took honours in political science in 1894. In 1895, he then took a law degree (LLB).

==First marriage and children==

In 1895, a year before finishing his second degree (law), Ngata married 16-year-old Arihia Kane Tamati who was also of the Ngāti Porou iwi. Ngata had previously been engaged to Arihia&#x27;s elder sister, Te Rina, but she died. Āpirana and Arihia had fifteen children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood; six girls and five boys.

Shortly after Ngata&#x27;s legal qualifications were recognised, he and his wife returned to Waiomatatini where they built a house, initially called &#x27;Te Wharehou&#x27; and later known as &#x27;The Bungalow&#x27;. Ngata quickly became prominent in the community, making a number of efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of Māori across the country. He also wrote extensively on the place of Māori culture in the modern age. At the same time, he gradually acquired a leadership role within Ngāti Porou, particularly in the area of land management and finance.

==Political career==
Ngata&#x27;s first involvement with national politics came through his friendship with James Carroll, who was Minister of Native Affairs in the Liberal Party government. Ngata assisted Carroll in the preparation of two pieces of legislation, both of which were intended to increase the legal rights enjoyed by Māori. In the 1905 election, Ngata himself stood as the Liberal candidate for the Eastern Maori electorate, challenging the incumbent Wi Pere. Ngata was elected to Parliament.

===Early career===





Ngata quickly distinguished himself in Parliament as a skilled orator. He worked closely with his friend Carroll, and also worked closely with Robert Stout. Ngata and Stout, members of the Native Land Commission, were often critical of the government&#x27;s policies towards Māori, particularly those designed at encouraging the sale of Māori land. In 1909, Ngata assisted John Salmond in the drafting of the Native Land Act.

In late 1909, Ngata was appointed to Cabinet, holding a minor ministerial responsibility for Māori land councils. He retained this position until 1912, when the Liberal government was defeated. Ngata followed the Liberals into Opposition.

In the First World War, Ngata was highly active in gathering Māori recruits for military service, working closely with Reform Party MP, Maui Pomare. Ngata&#x27;s own Ngāti Porou were particularly well represented among the volunteers. The Māori commitment to the war by some iwi, can be attributed to Ngata and Pomare and this created a certain amount of goodwill from Pākehā towards iwi who had loyally supported the country; this assisted Ngata&#x27;s later attempts to resolve land grievances.

Although in Opposition, Ngata enjoyed relatively good relations with his counterparts across the House in the Reform Party. He had a particularly good relationship with Gordon Coates, who became Prime Minister in 1925 and later Princess Te Puea of Waikato. The establishment of several government bodies, such as the Māori Purposes Fund Control Board and the Board of Māori Ethnological Research, owed much to Ngata&#x27;s involvement.

====Māori interests====

Ngata was also active in a huge variety of other endeavours. The most notable, perhaps, was his involvement in academic and literary circles – in this period, he published a number of works on significant Māori culture, with , a collection of Māori songs, being one of his better known works. Ngata was also heavily involved in the protection and advancement of Māori culture among Māori themselves, giving particular attention to promoting the haka, poi dancing, and traditional carving that had been begun by Te Puea.

In 1926 Ngata spearheaded government legislation which established the School of Māori Arts that later became the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute. The school was to preserve Māori arts and crafts amongst fears the skills and knowledge would be lost forever. One aspect of his advocacy of Māori culture was the construction of many new traditional meeting houses throughout the country.

Yet another of Ngata&#x27;s interests was the promotion of Māori sport, which he fostered by encouraging intertribal competitions and tournaments. Finally, Ngata also promoted Māori issues within the Anglican Church in New Zealand, encouraging the creation of a Māori bishopric. In December 1928, Frederick Bennett, was consecrated as suffragan bishop to the Waiapu diocese with the title Bishop of Aotearoa. Ngata and Bishop Herbert Williams campaigned for the recognition of Māori language as a subject for study in the University of New Zealand, with the study of Māori becoming eligible for a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1928.

Throughout all this, Ngata also remained deeply involved in the affairs of his Ngāti Porou iwi, particularly as regards land development. He was instrumental in establishing the land incorporation scheme whereby unused Māori land with multiple owners was amalgamated under a farm manager—often Pākehā, who developed and ran the farm. In government he was able to arrange for the transfer of four blocks of farm land to Te Puea Herangi and her husband. He arranged grants and government loans to help her develop farms for Waikato. He fired the Pākehā farm manager and replaced him with Te Puea. He arranged a car for her so she could travel around her estates. In 1934, during the depression, the public, media and parliament became alarmed at the large sums of money being gifted to Te Puea and others. A royal commission was held and Ngata was found guilty of irregularities in expenditure and negligence in administration, but no major scandals were unearthed. His land projects up to 1934 had involved the expenditure of £500,000, most of which was recoverable. Ngata resigned in December 1934. Ngata fought for higher living standards for the Māori people, and was very active during an economic depression in New Zealand in the Thirties, developing large farms which provided jobs and helped to restore the dignity of many Māori.

Ngata was knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 1927 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, only the third Māori (after Carroll and Pomare) to receive this honour.

===Ministerial career===

In the 1928 election, the United Party (a rebranding of the old Liberal Party, to which Ngata belonged) won an unexpected victory. Ngata was returned to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Native Affairs. He was ranked third within Cabinet, and occasionally served as acting Deputy Prime Minister. Ngata remained extremely diligent in his work, and was noted for his tirelessness. Much of his ministerial work related to land reforms, and the encouragement of Māori land development. Ngata continued to believe in the need to rejuvenate Māori society, and worked strongly towards this goal.

In 1929, Ngata&#x27;s wife Arihia Ngata and his eldest son Mākarini died of dysentery. After Arihia&#x27;s death, Ngata married Te Rīringi Tūhou in 1932.

In 1932 Ngata and his Department of Native Affairs came under increasing criticism from other politicians. Many believed that Ngata was pressing ahead too fast, and the large amount of activity that Ngata ordered had caused organisational difficulties within the department. An inquiry into Ngata&#x27;s department was held, and it was discovered that one of Ngata&#x27;s subordinates had falsified accounts. Ngata himself was severely criticised for disregarding official regulations which he had often felt were inhibiting progress. It was also alleged that Ngata had shown favouritism to Ngāti Porou and Waikato, especially Te Puea and her husband Rawiri Tumokai Katipa. Bob Semple, a leading Labour politician, said the Royal Commission investigation showed one of the worst specimens of abuse of political power, maladministration, misappropriation of public funds as well as a betrayal of trust. Ngata, while denying any personal wrongdoing, accepted responsibility for the actions of his department and was dismissed from his ministerial position.

Māori leaders, such as Te Puea, were angry at Ngata for discrediting and embarrassing Māori.

==Later life and legacy==
Although Ngata had resigned from Cabinet, he still remained in Parliament. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935. In the 1935 election, the Labour Party was triumphant – Ngata went into Opposition, although the new Labour government retained many of his land reform programs. Ngata remained in Parliament until the 1943 election, when he was finally defeated by a Labour-Rātana candidate, Tiaki Omana. He had been a member of parliament for almost 38 consecutive years, breaking the previous record of 32 years set by James Carroll and coming close to Maurice O&#x27;Rorke overall record of nearly 39 years. Both marks were later surpassed by Rex Mason.

Ngata stood again for his seat in the 1946 election, but was unsuccessful. He remained involved in politics despite leaving Parliament. He gave advice on Māori affairs to both Peter Fraser (a Labour Prime Minister) and Ernest Corbett (a National Minister of Māori Affairs), and arranged celebrations of the Treaty of Waitangi&#x27;s centenary in 1940. In the Second World War, he once again helped gather Māori recruits. On 22 June 1950, he was appointed to Parliament&#x27;s upper house, the Legislative Council, but was too ill by this time to take his seat.

In 1948, Ngata&#x27;s second wife, Lady Te Rīringi, died, and he married Hēne Te Kira not long before his own death.

On 7 May 1948, Ngata received an honorary doctorate in literature (LittD) from the Victoria College. At the same ceremony, his youngest son Hēnare graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.
Ngata died in Waiomatatini on 14 July 1950, following a brief illness, and was buried beside his first wife Lady Arihia behind their home &#x27;The Bungalow&#x27; in Waiomatatini. He is remembered for his great contributions to Māori culture and language. His image has appeared on the New Zealand fifty-dollar note since 1999 along with Porourangi Meeting House, which is significant as it is located next to the original Ngata family home and Waiomatatini Marae, near Ruatōria.

Sir Āpirana and Lady Arihia Ngata guided the design of the St. Michael and All Angels&#x27; Chapel at Hukarere Girls College, and the chapel was consecrated on 1 November 1953.

Several schools have houses named after him, including Rangiora High School, Tauranga Boys&#x27; College, Rotorua Intermediate, Cashmere High School, Te Aute College (where Ngata went), Te Puke High School, Wainuiomata High School and Otumoetai Intermediate.

Ngata has inspired all sorts of politicians today, who follow his blend of progressive conservatism. As controversial as he was adulated, Ngata&#x27;s legacy is still very complicated. While many have praised him for tireless work to promote the Māori language (especially in a white-based, right-wing political environment), others have criticised and even derided him for corruption, conservatism and not taking the views of all his iwi into account while making incredibly important decisions on his own.

In 1999, Ngata was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

==Family legacy==
On 19 October 2009, Āpirana Ngata&#x27;s last surviving daughter, Mate Huatahi Kaiwai (born Ngata), died at her residence at Ruatoria, East Cape, New Zealand, aged 94. She was interred next to her late husband Kaura-Ki-Te-Pakanga Kaiwai and her son Tanara Kaiwai at Pukearoha Urupa. In the 2004 New Year Honours she had been made a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order (QSO) for community service.

Ngata&#x27;s youngest son, Sir Hēnare Ngata, died on 11 December 2011 aged 93. He was Māori vice-president of the National Party from 1967 to 1969 and stood as the National Party candidate for Eastern Māori in 1969.

Ngata&#x27;s grandson Hōri Mahue Ngata wrote a widely used Māori-English dictionary.

<text>Sundiver is a 1980 science fiction novel by American writer David Brin. It is the first book of his first Uplift trilogy, followed by &quot;Startide Rising&quot; in 1983 and &quot;The Uplift War&quot; in 1987.

==Background==
The book takes place in a galaxy filled with alien races, all of whom were &quot;uplifted&quot; into sentience by another race through the use of directed breeding. As &quot;payment&quot; for being made sentient, the uplifted races are subservient to their uplifters for a period of time. All existing races have reached sentience through this process, and follow a common evolution in which the races become free of their uplifters, enter a period of independent power, and then fade and eventually disappear.

The arrival of a human ship at a populated star upsets the established races as humanity reached sentience on their own. This had been believed to be impossible, nothing of the sort is known in the eons-old galactic library. This leads to great arguments among the alien powers. Humanity begins to uplift other species on Earth, including chimpanzees and dolphins, but does not demand subservience.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins with the main character, Jacob Demwa, working at the center for uplift on Earth. He is recovering from a tragedy at the Vanilla Space Needle where he saved the space elevator from destruction but lost his love in the process. An alien friend of Demwa&#x27;s, Fagin (a Kanten), contacts Demwa and offers him a job. Initially reluctant to return to his previous life as a scientific investigator, Demwa agrees to attend a secret meeting. He learns that there are &quot;ghosts&quot; appearing in the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere. The ghosts are without precedent in the galactic library, and they seem to be yet another self-sentient race arising in the Solar System.

Demwa agrees to come and investigate the origin and purpose of the sun-ghosts, and travels to Mercury where the sundiver project is based. With him on Mercury are Helene deSilva, an attractive station commander with whom Jacob develops a relationship over the course of the book; Fagin; Pila Bubbacub, the library representative; his assistant Culla (a Pring); Dr. Dwayne Kepler (the head of the Sundiver expedition); Dr. Mildred Martine (a psychiatrist); and the exuberant journalist Peter LaRoque. The Sundiver is a spherical ship designed to approach the Sun quite closely, with living quarters on one side and a large instrumentation section on the other.

Demwa goes to the sun, and observes the sun-ghosts. There are apparently three forms. The &quot;toroids&quot; appear to be similar to cattle and live off of the magnetic fields in the chromosphere. Another form is an apparently intelligent variety that is seen herding toroids. Finally there is a very different anthropomorphic figure that approaches the ship but avoids the side where the instruments are located and is somewhat threatening. When a neo-chimpanzee scientist, Dr. Jeffrey, is killed on a solo mission to the sun, it seems to confirm the sun-ghosts&#x27; hostile intent. An investigation seems to implicate the reporter, LaRoque. LaRoque is then tested to determine if he is capable of murder. The test results indicate LaRoque has violent tendencies and he is incarcerated.

A third trip to the sun is undertaken, in hopes that Pila Bubbacub will be able to contact the sun-ghosts. It fails to do so, but claims to have succeeded, saying that the sun-ghosts are offended and have used psi to control LaRoque&#x27;s actions. He uses a powder that blocks the ship&#x27;s sensors to pretend he has dispelled the sun-ghosts because he is embarrassed by the Library&#x27;s lack of data on the ghosts. Back on Mercury, Jacob discovers his trick, and reveals it, resulting in disgrace to Bubbacub and embarrassment for the Pila.
The characters go on yet another mission into the sun, this time with a laser to communicate with the sun-ghosts. They make brief contact with one of the ghosts, but then an anthropomorphic ghost appears and warns them against further exploration of the sun. While they are leaving, they discover that one of Culla&#x27;s dietary supplements is a dye used in tunable lasers. Combining this with an earlier conversation about Culla&#x27;s eyesight, Demwa concludes that Culla can project laser light from his eyes: he has been faking the anthropomorphic ghosts. When Culla realizes he has been discovered he retreats to the instrument side of the ship and begins disabling the equipment that propels the sunship so that it will fall into the photosphere, taking all evidence of his deception with it. The sun-ghosts use toroids to arrest the ship&#x27;s fall, but eventually they give out, and the ship plummets. While Demwa and one of the crew attempt to disable Culla, Helene discovers that only the galactic technology has been sabotaged, and uses the refrigerator laser as a thruster to move the ship out of the sun. Culla is killed, and the ship eventually escapes the sun, though all but Fagin temporarily &quot;die&quot; of hypothermia and frostbite from the refrigerator laser. The ship&#x27;s records are recovered, showing that Culla used his laser sight to discredit Bubbacub, as part of a campaign to free his species from its client status, and then to sabotage the ship when he was discovered to prevent the Pila from finding out.

Although set in the same universe as the rest of the other Uplift books, it is set a considerable amount of time before the other books, and shares none of the same characters, apart from Jacob Demwa, who is mentioned as the mentor of Tom Orley and Gillian Baskin, and Helene Alvarez (née deSilva), who is mentioned in &quot;Startide Rising&quot; as Credeiki&#x27;s former captain aboard the &quot;James Cook&quot; and who appears in &quot;The Uplift War&quot; to sign a treaty with the Thennanin.

==Continuity==
The technique used to escape the sun alive when the Galactics&#x27; technology is sabotaged, using a refrigeration laser to dump the solar heat from the ship, is used again in &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Reach&quot;.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Sundiver&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #3 and commented that &quot;&quot;Sundiver&quot; is thought-provoking, tightly-plotted, and readable. Though Brin&#x27;s human characters are rather two-dimensional and the story depends less on their interaction and development than on the setting and science, he is somewhat more competent in this area than [author James P. Hogan on &quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot;]. All told, it is a remarkable first effort.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Sundiver&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #68, and stated that &quot;Certain characters&#x27; weird actions are performed solely to help Brin&#x27;s plot: but this &quot;is&quot; a first novel. His second won the Hugo.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
Sundiver was a nominee for the 1981 Locus Award in the First Novel category.

<doc id="722663" wikidata="Q1042300" url="?curid=722663" title="Fauna (deity)">
<text>Fauna is a Roman rustic goddess said in differing ancient sources to be the wife, sister, or daughter of Faunus (the Roman counterpart of Pan). Varro regarded her as the female counterpart of Faunus, and said that the &quot;fauni&quot; all had prophetic powers. She is also called Fatua or Fenta Fauna.

==Name==
=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Fauna&quot; is a feminine form of Latin &quot;Faunus&quot;, the deity of the countryside. &quot;Faunus&quot; itself is generally thought to stem from Proto-Italic &quot;*fawe&quot; or &quot;*fawono&quot;, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*bʰh₂u-n&quot; (&#x27;favourable&#x27;). Consequently, Georges Dumézil translated her name as &quot;the Favourable.&quot;

In his conceptual approach to Roman deity, Michael Lipka sees Faunus and Fauna as an example of a characteristically Roman tendency to form gender-complementary pairs within a sphere of functionality. The male-female figures never have equal prominence, and one partner (not always the female) seems to have been modelled on the other. An Oscan dedication naming &quot;Fatuveís&quot; (= &quot;Fatui&quot;, genitive singular), found at Aeclanum in Irpinia, indicates that the concept is Italic. Fauna has also been dismissed as merely &quot;an artificial construction of scholarly casuistics.&quot;

=== Ancient interpretations ===
Varro explained the role of Faunus and Fauna as prophetic deities:

&quot;Fauni&quot; are gods of the Latins, so that there is both a male &quot;Faunus&quot; and a female &quot;Fauna&quot;; there is a tradition that they used to speak of (&quot;fari&quot;) future events in wooded places using the verses they call &#x27;Saturnians&#x27;, and thus they were called &quot; &#x27;Fauni&#x27; &quot; from &#x27;speaking&#x27; (&quot;fando&quot;).

Servius identifies Faunus with Fatuclus, and says his wife is Fatua or Fauna, deriving the names as Varro did from &quot;fari&quot;, &quot;to speak,&quot; &quot;because they can foretell the future.&quot; The early Christian author Lactantius called her &quot;Fenta Fauna&quot; and said that she was both the sister and wife of Faunus; according to Lactantius, Fatua sang the &quot;fata&quot;, &quot;fates,&quot; to women as Faunus did to men. Justin said that Fatua, the wife of Faunus, &quot;being filled with divine spirit assiduously predicted future events as if in a madness &quot;(furor)&quot;,&quot; and thus the verb for divinely inspired speech is &quot;fatuari&quot;.

While several etymologists in antiquity derived the names &quot;Fauna&quot; and &quot;Faunus&quot; from &quot;fari&quot;, &quot;to speak,&quot; Macrobius regarded Fauna&#x27;s name as deriving from &quot;faveo, favere&quot;, &quot;to favor, nurture,&quot; &quot;because she nurtures all that is useful to living creatures.&quot; According to Macrobius, the Books of the Pontiffs &quot;(pontificum libri)&quot; treated Bona Dea, Fauna, Ops, and Fatua as names for the same goddess, Maia.

<doc id="722667" wikidata="Q6760429" url="?curid=722667" title="Marginal seat">
<text>A marginal seat or swing seat is a constituency held with a small majority in a legislative election, generally one conducted under a single-winner voting system. In Canada, they may be known as target ridings. The opposite is a safe seat. The term ultra-marginal seat refers to a constituency with a majority of single digits, usually within a percentage of 2%.

Examples of traditionally marginal seats in the United Kingdom include Broxtowe, Watford, Bolton West and Thurrock. In Australia, marginal seats include Lindsay in New South Wales, Bass in Tasmania, Longman in Queensland and Corangamite in Victoria. Ultra-marginal seats in Australia include the federal seat of Gilmore in New South Wales and the state seats of Bundaberg in Queensland and Kogarah in New South Wales.

==Examples==

===Australia===
The Australian Electoral Commission defines seat margins as follows:

====Federal====
Following the 2022 federal election, 51 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives are considered &quot;marginal&quot;. The most marginal is the Division of Gilmore in New South Wales, held by the Labor Party on a margin of 0.17% against the Liberal Party. This seat was retained by Labor by just over 300 votes.

====New South Wales====
Following the 2023 state election, 18 of the 93 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly are marginal seats. The most marginal is Ryde, held by the Liberal Party on a margin of 0.01% against the Labor Party. This seat was won by Jordan Lane by just 50 votes on the first count (and 54 on the recount), successfully succeeding outgoing Liberal MP Victor Dominello. It is believed that the seat became marginal due to the Dominello&#x27;s departure, due to his popularity in the area.

====Northern Territory====
Following the 2024 general election, eight of the 25 seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly are marginal seats. The most marginal is Nightcliff, held by the Greens on a margin of 0.4% against the Labor Party, who lost the seat by just 36 votes.

====Queensland====
Following the 2020 state election, 29 of the 93 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland are marginal seats. The most marginal is the Bundaberg, held by the Labor Party on a margin of 0.01% against the Liberal National Party, who lost the seat by just nine votes.

====South Australia====
Following the 2022 state election, 17 of the 47 seats in the South Australian Legislative Assembly are marginal seats. The most marginal is Dunstan, held by the Liberal Party on a margin of 0.8% against the Labor Party. Notably, this seat is held by former Liberal leader Steven Marshall, who was also the state&#x27;s Premier until this election.

====Victoria====
Following the 2022 state election, 28 of the 88 seats in the Victorian Legislative Assembly are marginal seats. The two most marginal are Bass and Northcote, both of which are held by the Labor Party on a margin of 0.2% against the Liberal Party and the Greens, respectively.

====Western Australia====
Following the 2021 state election, just five of the 59 seats in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly are marginal seats. The most marginal is Churchlands, held by the Labor Party on a margin of 0.8% against the Liberal Party.

===United States===
In the United States, examples of congressional districts considered marginal in recent years include Illinois&#x27;s 10th congressional district, located in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Texas&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, covering most of Texas&#x27; border with Mexico, and New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which includes much of the state&#x27;s eastern half, including its most populous city Manchester. Within the past decade, these three districts are examples of ones that have frequently switched partisan control and seen close races.

However, political realignments and redistricting may cause traditionally marginal districts to become safe for one party or another. An example of the former is Indiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district, which was nicknamed the &quot;Bloody Eighth&quot; for its history of ousting incumbents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. However, as rural white voters, who are a large percentage of the district&#x27;s population, have become increasingly Republican, it is now considered a safely Republican seat. On the other hand, North Carolina&#x27;s 11th congressional district is an example of a seat that lost its marginal status due to redistricting. It was formerly a highly competitive seat, albeit with a slight conservative lean, that often changed partisan hands. The Democratic base in the district was the city of Asheville, while Republicans were dominant in much of the city&#x27;s suburbs, and the mountainous rural areas were evenly split between the two parties. However, the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature redrew the district in 2012 to remove much of Asheville and add conservative territory from the adjacent 10th district, therefore making the district much more difficult to win for three-term incumbent Heath Shuler, a conservative Democrat. Indeed, Shuler opted to retire, and Republican Mark Meadows won the seat easily, subsequently holding it until March 2020 when he resigned to serve as White House Chief of Staff.

Conversely, seats that were formerly considered safe for one party may become swing seats. For instance, Orange County, California, was traditionally a Republican stronghold, and most of its congressional seats were solidly Republican for decades. However, demographic changes, particularly Democratic strength with Hispanic and Asian voters, have eroded Republican dominance of the county; Hillary Clinton won it in 2016, becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to do so since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, while Democrats, for the first time in many years, swept all of its congressional seats in the 2018 midterms.

Marginal seats only require a small swing to change hands and therefore are typically the focus of most campaign resources. The concentration of money and human resources in areas where they will make the most difference is known as targeting.

==Strategies for securing marginal seats==
The creation of policy that will benefit a particular seat, at the expense of other taxpayers, is known as pork barreling.

Political parties often face tension between the holders of marginal seats and safe seats. Safe seats tend to be allocated far less discretionary resources—governmental as well as political—from their political party than do marginal seats.

A similar phenomenon happens in United States presidential elections, where the Electoral College system means that candidates must win states rather than the popular vote. Again, resources are concentrated towards the swing states with the smallest majorities.

<text>The Greece national football team (, ) represents Greece in men&#x27;s international football matches, and is controlled by the Hellenic Football Federation, the governing body for football in Greece. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.

Greece&#x27;s first appearance in a major tournament was at UEFA Euro 1980 where they were knocked out in the group stage. Their qualification to the then eight-team UEFA European Championship gave them a position in the top eight European football nations that year. Greece did not qualify for another major tournament until the 1994 FIFA World Cup and after an undefeated qualifying campaign, they produced a poor performance in the finals, losing all three group matches without scoring.

UEFA Euro 2004 marked the highest point in Greece&#x27;s football history when they won the tournament in only their second participation. Dismissed as rank outsiders before the tournament, Greece defeated some of the favourites in the competition including defending European champions France and hosts Portugal twice. During the tournament, Greece defeated the hosts in both the opening game of the tournaments and again in the final. Their triumph earned them a place in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.

In the decade after the 2004 victory, Greece qualified for the finals tournaments of all but one major competition entered, reaching the quarter-finals at the UEFA Euro 2012 and the round of 16 at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. During that period, they occupied a place in the top 20 of the FIFA World Rankings for all but four months, and reached an all-time high of eighth in the world from April to June 2008, as well as in October 2011. 

Since 2014, Greece has not made an appearance at the finals of any major tournament.

==History==


===First years===
On 12 April 1896, a Greek XI represented by Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon lost to a Denmark XI by either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.

The first three editions of the Olympic football event (1900–06) had an unofficial status, as the event was not yet open for national football teams to compete, and only had limited participation of three or four club teams from a few nations. Greece had no club team invited in the 1900 Olympics and the 1904 Olympics, but then hosted the 1906 Olympics, competing against a Danish club team again (DBU Copenhagen) and two club teams from the Ottoman Empire (Smyrna and Thessaloniki). The team to represent Greece compiled of players from Athens, hence the Athens City selection, and in the final they conceded 9 goals from the Denmark XI in the first half alone, and thereby they withdrew from the final at half time, and were then invited to a play-off in a match to decide the second place, but Athens declined and were promptly ejected from the tournament.

Greece had to wait 13 years for their next (unofficial) appearance when they participated in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris in 1919, following the end of World War I, and once again it was a disaster as the team conceded twenty goals without reply in their first two games, although this time with a silver lining since Greece managed to beat Romania in their third and final match with a dramatic 3–2 win. In the following year, Greece participated in the 1920 Summer Games of Antwerp, being knocked out in the first round by Sweden with yet another heavy defeat (9–0). This match is recognized as their first official match by FIFA. Notable figures during these years was Giorgos Kalafatis, player and later manager of the team, and Giannis Andrianopoulos.

The Greece national team&#x27;s first official match came on 7 April 1929 in a 1–4 loss to Italy B, with Alberto Nahmias being the author of the nation&#x27;s first-ever official goal.

===1930s Balkan Cups===
Between 1929 and 1936, Greece participated in six Balkan Cups, with their best campaign coming in the 1934–35 Balkan Cup when they finished second just one point short of Yugoslavia. A notable figure during these years was Kostas Choumis, who scored a total of 7 goals in the Balkan Cup, being among the all-time top goal scorers in the competition&#x27;s history.

===1950s Mediterranean Cups===
Between 1949 and 1958, Greece participated in three Mediterranean Cups, with their best campaign coming in the 1950–53 Mediterranean Cup when they finished second just one point short of Italy B. A notable figure during these years was Georgios Darivas, who was the top goal scorer of the 1950-53 edition with 4 goals, a tally that includes a hat-trick against Turkey.

In 1951, Greece also won the 1st edition of the Mediterranean Games men&#x27;s football tournament, held in Alexandria, Egypt, defeating both Syria and the hosts Egypt on their way to the title. The star of the Greece team was Nikos Lekatsas, who was the top goal scorer with 4 goals, a tally that includes a hat-trick against Syria.

===1970s World Cups near misses===
During the following decades, Greece had passion but little international success in the sport, as the nation&#x27;s economical and social situations after World War II did not allow for successful development of a national team.

At its best, Greece narrowly missed qualifying for two FIFA World Cup competitions: 1970 (despite a quality team, including some of its greatest-ever players, such as Mimis Domazos, Giorgos Sideris, Giorgos Koudas and Mimis Papaioannou), and 1978.

===Euro 1980===
Greece, under the guidance of Alketas Panagoulias, made its first appearance in a major tournament at the Euro 1980 in Italy, after qualifying top of a group that included the Soviet Union and Hungary, both world football powers. In the final tournament, Greece was drawn into group A with West Germany, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia. In their first game, Greece held the Dutch until the only goal of the game was scored with a penalty kick by Kist, in the 65th minute. Three days later Greece played Czechoslovakia in Rome. After holding the Czechoslovakians 1–1 at the end the first half, Greece eventually lost 3–1. In their last game, Greece earned a 0–0 draw against eventual winners West Germany, concluding what was considered a decent overall performance in the team&#x27;s maiden presence in a final phase of any football competition.

=== Wilderness before 1994 ===
Greece failed to qualify for six competitive tournaments: three World Cups and three Euros, during which the Greeks largely produced poor performance. Despite this, Greece did have some surprisingly good results, such as a shock away draw to Italy in the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification; a 3–2 win away over Hungary and a goalless draw away to England for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying; a goalless home draw to Belgium in the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification; a surprise 1–0 home victory over Poland in the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying; a 1–0 shock home win over Bulgaria and a 1–1 draw to Denmark in the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification; and a heroic 3–2 comeback victory over Portugal. However, Greece suffered from shortage of quality strikers and its defence was largely disorganized at best, resulting in Greece botching important games and thus failed to qualify.

===1994 World Cup===
The team&#x27;s success in qualifying for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, marked the first time they had made it to the FIFA World Cup finals. Greece finished first and undefeated in their qualifying group, surpassing Russia in the final game. In the final tournament Greece were drawn into Group D with Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Argentina. After the successful qualifying campaign, expectations back in Greece were high as no one could imagine the oncoming astounding failure. Most notable reason for this complete failure was the fact that Alketas Panagoulias opted to take a squad full of those players – though most of them aging and out of form – that helped the team in the qualifying instead of new emerging talents seeing it as a reward for their unprecedented success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaisaris/Sport24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they had the disadvantage of being drawn into a &quot;group of death&quot;, with runners-up at the 1990 FIFA World Cup Argentina, later semifinalists Bulgaria, and Nigeria, one of the strongest African teams. Panagoulias was also criticized for his and the Greek Federation&#x27;s practice of carrying the players around to various events of the Greek community and sponsors before the official matches. It is worth mentioning that all players of the squad, including the three goalkeepers, took part in those three games, something very rare.

This tournament was humiliating for the Greece squad, though it was understandable (if not say predictable) given its maiden appearance and the vast disparity of quality of opponents. In their first game against Argentina at Foxboro Stadium just outside Boston, they lost 4–0. Four days later Greece suffered another 4–0 blow from Bulgaria at Soldier Field in Chicago, and then, in what would be their final game, they lost to Nigeria 2–0 at Foxboro Stadium again. In the end, Greece were eliminated in the first round by losing all three games, scoring no goals and conceding ten.

===Near misses===
Greece failed to qualify for the Euro 1996 finishing third in the group behind Russia and Scotland. In their 1998 World Cup qualifying tournament the team finished only one point shy of second-placed Croatia after a 0–0 draw by the eventual Group winners, the Danish. Croatia and Denmark would make the Semi-Finals and Quarter-Finals respectively, of that World Cup. In their Euro 2000 qualifying group, Greece finished again in third place, two points behind second-placed Slovenia in a highly disappointing campaign that saw the team lose at home to Latvia. In the 2002 World Cup qualifying Greece finished a disappointing fourth in their group behind England, Germany and Finland, which led to the sacking of coach Vasilios Daniil, replaced by Otto Rehhagel. Highlights of the campaign included a 5–1 defeat in Finland and the 2–2 draw that followed in England, the first of two games the Greece national team would be under the reins of the German coach.

===European Champions: Euro 2004 triumph===


====Qualification====
Greece started the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification campaign with defeats at home to Spain and away to Ukraine, both with a 2–0 scoreline. The team went on to win their remaining six games, including a 1–0 away win over Spain in Zaragoza, securing first place in the group and an appearance in the European Championship finals for the first time in 24 years.

====Before the tournament====
Greece were the second-least favorite in the competition to win, with Latvia being the least favorite. Greece were also considered as outsiders and underdogs and were given odds of 150–1 of winning before the tournament. They were drawn in Group A, ending up with Portugal, Spain and Russia, a &quot;group of death&quot;; Portugal, hosts and favourites to win, Spain, UEFA Euro 1964 champions and favorites to win, and Russia, who won the first-ever tournament as the Soviet Union. Very few people expected Greece to proceed to the quarter-finals, let alone win the tournament.

====Group stage====
In the opening match against hosts Portugal, Greece achieved a surprise 2–1 victory, receiving the nickname &quot;pirate ship&quot; (Το Πειρατικό) used by Greek sportscasters in reference to the floating ship used in the tournament&#x27;s opening ceremony. Greece won with a 25-yard strike by Giorgos Karagounis and a penalty by Angelos Basinas. Four days later, Greece stunned Spain in front of a largely Spanish crowd with a 1–1 draw after being down 1–0 at half time. Greece fell behind from a defensive lapse, which allowed Fernando Morientes to score. However a sublime diagonal pass by playmaker Vasilios Tsiartas allowed Angelos Charisteas to score an equaliser in the second half, giving Greece hope of qualifying. In the final group match Greece fell behind 2–0 to Russia (who were already eliminated) within the first ten minutes of the game but managed to pull one back through Zisis Vryzas and thus progressed to the next round, at the expense of Spain, on goals scored. Dmitri Kirichenko had the chance to eliminate Greece in the final minutes of this match, but his stretched effort squeezed just wide.

====Quarter-finals====
In the quarter-finals Greece faced off with the undefeated and reigning champions France. At 65 minutes Greece took the lead. Angelos Basinas played a perfect pass to captain Theodoros Zagorakis, who flicked the ball high in the air, past veteran French defender Bixente Lizarazu, and sent a perfect cross to Angelos Charisteas for the header and goal. Greece held on to win despite a late French onslaught, with close efforts by Thierry Henry, thus knocking France out of Euro 2004 and becoming the first team ever to defeat both the hosts and defending champions in the same tournament.

====Semi-finals====
Greece reached the semi-finals to face the Czech Republic, who were the only team to defeat all of their opponents to that point. The Czech record included a convincing 3–2 win over the Netherlands, a 2–1 win over Germany, and a 3–0 win over Denmark in the quarter-finals. At this stage in the tournament the Czechs were favourites to take the trophy. The game began nervously for Greece, as the Czech Republic applied much pressure. Tomáš Rosický hit the bar in the opening minutes, and Jan Koller had several efforts saved by Antonios Nikopolidis. The Czechs chances were dealt a blow when influential midfielder Pavel Nedvěd left the pitch injured in the first half. After 90 minutes the game ended 0–0, despite the Czechs having most of the game&#x27;s missed chances. In the final minute of the first half of extra time, a close range silver goal header by Traianos Dellas from a corner of Vasilios Tsiartas ended the Czech campaign, putting Greece into the final of Euro 2004 and sending their fans into euphoria.

====Final====

For the first time in history the final was a repeat of the opening match, with Greece and hosts Portugal facing off in a rematch. In the 57th minute Charisteas gave Greece the lead with a header from a corner by Angelos Basinas. Portugal had much of the possession, but the Greece defence was solid and dealt with most attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo had a good chance to equalise in the dying moments, but could not apply a finish. Greece held on to win 1–0, winning the tournament, an achievement considered by many to be one of the greatest football upsets in history, if not the greatest. Greece captain Zagorakis was named the player of the tournament, having led Greece and made the most tackles in the entire tournament.

====Recognition====
Greece&#x27;s victory shot them up in the FIFA World Rankings from 35th in June 2004 to 14th in July 2004. This is one of the largest upward moves in a single month in the top echelon of the rankings. The triumph of Greece at Euro 2004 is the biggest sporting achievement in the country&#x27;s history for a team sport, along with the successes of the Greece national basketball team in the European Championships of 1987, 2005 and 2006 FIBA World Championship and the World Championship title of Greece women&#x27;s national water polo team in 2011. The team has appeared on stamps and received medals from Konstantinos Stephanopoulos (the President of Greece), Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens, and an ecstatic ovation from the country&#x27;s population which came out to see the team drive with the trophy from the Athens airport to the Panathenaic Stadium where the Greek political and religious leadership was awaiting them. The Euro 2004 winners were selected as &quot;World Team of the Year&quot; at the 2005 Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.

===2005 Confederations Cup===
As European champions, Greece qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany and were drawn into Group B along with 2002 FIFA World Cup champions Brazil, 2004 AFC Asian Cup champions Japan, and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions Mexico. Greece lost their first two matches 3–0 to Brazil and 1–0 to Japan before drawing 0–0 with Mexico to finish at the bottom of the group. The squad included players such as Stathis Tavlaridis, Loukas Vyntra, Michalis Sifakis, Ioannis Amanatidis and Theofanis Gekas, all of whom earned their first call ups or maiden caps in the national squad.

===2006 World Cup qualifying===
After winning the Euro 2004, Greece faced Ukraine, Turkey, Denmark, Albania, Georgia and Kazakhstan in Group 2 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament. Greece opened their campaign with a 2–1 loss to Albania in Tirana before draws with Turkey (0–0) and Ukraine (1–1) followed by a 3–1 victory over Kazakhstan.

In 2005, Greece resumed their campaign with three victories, defeating Denmark 2–1; Georgia 3–1; and Albania 2–0; before earning a goalless away draw with Turkey. Just prior to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Greece lost 1–0 at home to Ukraine after a late goal from Andriy Husin. Following a 2–1 away win against Kazakhstan, the team experienced a setback after a 1–0 defeat to Denmark in Copenhagen diminished their chances of qualification.

In their last game, Greece defeated Georgia, finishing in fourth place, four points behind first-placed Ukraine, two behind Turkey, and a point behind Denmark. Throughout the match, fans in the Karaiskakis Stadium chanted the name of Otto Rehhagel in their utmost support and he said afterwards &quot;Even if 10 years pass, part of my heart will be Greek&quot;.

===Euro 2008===
Greece was the highest-ranked seed for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying tournament and was drawn with Turkey, Norway, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Moldova and Malta.

They began their Euro 2008 qualification campaign with victories over Moldova, Norway and Bosnia and Herzegovina before suffering a 4–1 home loss against Turkey in Athens. Greece went on to win away to Malta, with the only goal coming in the 66th minute from an Angelos Basinas penalty, beat Hungary and Moldova at home and drew 2–2 away to Norway despite having hit the goalpost three times in this match. The draw in Oslo was followed by a 3–2 home win against Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 1–0 away win to Turkey, securing its presence to the Euro 2008 finals at their old rival&#x27;s home ground. In the last two matches, Greece overcame Malta 5–0 in Athens and defeated Hungary with an away 2–1 win, finishing first in their group with a total of 31 points, the most points gained among any team in qualifying.

As defending European champions, Greece were top seed for the final tournament and were drawn with Sweden, Spain, and Russia in Group D.

In the tournament, Greece team lost all three games and scored only one goal. Greece underperformed in the opening match against Sweden and lost 2–0 before losing 1–0 to Russia. Having already been eliminated, Angelos Charisteas opened the scoring for Greece against Spain, but lost 2–1, becoming the first defending champion not to earn a single point in the next European Championship.

===2010 World Cup===
Despite the prowess of Europe&#x27;s top 2010 World Cup qualifying top scorer, Theofanis Gekas—who produced 10 goals in as many games—Greece took second place to Switzerland in Group 2 of UEFA qualification, thus advancing to a home-and-away playoff round, where they faced Ukraine. After a scoreless draw at home in the first match, the second leg in Donetsk saw Greece triumph with a 1–0 win, sending Greece to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the 2010 World Cup draw in Cape Town, South Africa on 4 December 2009, Greece found itself grouped with two familiar opponents from its first World Cup appearance in 1994. Argentina and Nigeria were yet again drawn into group stage play alongside Greece, this time into Group B with South Korea replacing Greece&#x27;s third 1994 opponent, Bulgaria.

In its World Cup opener, Greece lost 2–0 to South Korea after a dismal performance characterized by excessive long-ball attacks and a lack of offensive creativity. In the second fixture against Nigeria, Greece won 2–1, coming from behind after conceding an early goal. Dimitris Salpingidis scored Greece&#x27;s first-ever goal in the World Cup finals in the 44th minute of the first half to tie the match at 1–1. Vasilis Torosidis scored the winning goal in the 71st minute, securing the first points and first victory for Greece in tournament history. In the third match against heavily favoured Argentina, Greece needed a combination of results to advance to the next round. As expected, in what would be his final game as Greece&#x27;s national team head coach, Otto Rehhagel conjured up a very defensive-minded strategy, leaving Georgios Samaras with nearly all offensive responsibilities as the lone striker. The strategy nearly paid off in the second half with the score still locked at 0–0 when Samaras beat the last Argentine defender on a quick long-ball counter-attack but curled a rushed shot just wide of the far post. Greece held Argentina scoreless until the 77th minute but ultimately lost 2–0, finishing third in Group B.

Greece moved from 13th to 12th in the FIFA World Rankings following the tournament. Russia, Croatia and France dropped lower than Greece while Uruguay and Chile jumped ahead of them.
Twenty-four hours removed from Greece&#x27;s World Cup loss to Argentina, Otto Rehhagel stepped away from his post as Greece national team manager. Eight days later a new era in Greece football was ushered in as the Hellenic Football Federation named former AEK Athens and PAOK boss Fernando Santos the new manager. Under Santos the Greece immediately went to work on an unprecedented streak of success, setting a senior-club record by going unbeaten in Santos&#x27; first seventeen matches as manager. While Greece&#x27;s proficiency in stifling opposition attacks seemed to wane toward the end of Rehhagel&#x27;s tenure, the emergence of Santos seemed to galvanize Greece defending once more. Through seven international friendlies and ten Euro 2012 qualifiers, Greece kept nine clean sheets and conceded just one goal in each of the remaining eight contests. From start to end of their unbeaten run, Santos&#x27; national side moved from No. 12 to No. 8 in FIFA&#x27;s world rankings, equaling the highest mark in history credited by FIFA to Greece. Only one match from their streak featured a team (other than Greece) that appeared at the 2010 World Cup, a 1–0 defeat of Serbia in Belgrade.

===Euro 2012===

====Qualifying====
With its late-game comeback victory over Georgia in October 2011, Greece padded its historic football tournament résumé, most importantly by sealing an automatic berth into UEFA&#x27;s 2012 European Football Championship tournament. For the second time in team history the national side won its qualifying group for a major football tournament without a single loss incurred, as Greece also went undefeated in 1994 World Cup qualifiers. Adding to its 1980, 2004 and 2008 Euro qualifying campaigns, the Georgia triumph marked the fifth time overall that Greece has won its qualification group for a major tournament. Although their tendency to produce positive results remained steady throughout qualifying, so too did the Greece proclivity to start games slowly and concede early goals. This habit would plague Greece through qualifying and eventually tarnish their Euro 2012 performances.

Over two qualifying contests, Greece trailed Georgia on the scoreboard for 130 of 180 minutes and still managed to grab four of six possible points in the standings by way of three late strikes. Goals scored in the dying minutes of games, often coming from defenders, became somewhat of a Greek signature on Group F&#x27;s table. In fact Greece was able to take and keep a first-half lead just once in ten games, the 3–1 home defeat of Malta which was ranked 50th of 53 teams in Europe. In Malta, a last-second tie-breaking strike from defender Vasilis Torosidis pocketed a crucial extra two points in the standings for Greece, the same number of points it held over Croatia at the end of qualifying. Despite allowing weaker teams in the group to bring the game to them, Greece admirably held powerful Croatia scoreless through two meetings and deservedly won Group F four days after a decisive 2–0 home win versus the second-place Croats. Theofanis Gekas, who retired from national team service in 2010 after Fernando Santos&#x27; third game as manager, came out of retirement in time to contribute a goal to the result. Gekas was eventually included in Santos&#x27;s 23-man Euro 2012 roster, leaving out Euro 2004 hero, Angelos Charisteas who scored the group-clinching goal in the aforementioned Greece qualifying victory in Georgia.

====Group stage in Poland====
&quot;Shades of 2004&quot; was a commonly perceived theme regarding the buildup to Euro 2012 for Greece and their progression through the tournament. As in 2004 Greece was drawn into the same group as the host nation, Poland on this occasion, and also had the pressure of playing in the tournament&#x27;s opening match. Two familiar foes from its 2004 championship run, Russia and Czech Republic, joined Greece and Poland in Group A on 2 December 2011 at the tournament&#x27;s final draw in Kyiv. Upon drawing the lowest-ranked teams from Pots 1 and 2 as well as the second-lowest from Pot 4, Greece&#x27;s prospects of passing the group stage at Euro 2012 were given a boost.

Ideas of steering &quot;To Piratiko&quot; to a dream start in host-nation territory as Greece did in Portugal eight years before, rapidly turned sour during the opening match&#x27;s first half. From the outset Greece appeared uncomfortable holding the ball for long spells and seemed content to allow hosts Poland to push numbers forward with the ball, hoping to score through counter-attacks. However, Poland made the most of its early possession, as top scorer Robert Lewandowski converted a header from a goal line cross past a scurrying Kostas Chalkias. Hope and momentum continued to tip in favor of Poland when Sokratis Papastathopoulos received his second yellow card of the game in just the 44th minute from Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. Greece began to boss the game after halftime while playing down a man. Dimitris Salpingidis made the greatest impact on the game for Greece as a second-half substitute, making brilliant penetrating runs behind the Polish defense, eventually bringing the game level 1–1 on a mistake by Poland keeper Wojciech Szczęsny. Salpingidis was then responsible for levelling up the numbers for Greece when Szczęsny made a red-card foul on Salpingidis&#x27; breakaway attempt on goal in the 68th minute. But Greece captain Giorgos Karagounis&#x27; subsequent penalty kick was turned away by substitute keeper Przemysław Tytoń. A second goal by Salpingidis was disallowed as he was assisted by an offside Kostas Fortounis, denying Greece&#x27;s best opportunity to take three points from what ended as an improbable 1–1 draw.

The Czech Republic exploited Greece&#x27;s weakness at the left-defender position early in the second group stage match, notching two goals in the first six minutes. Just as Poland had, the Czechs repeatedly penetrated Greece back line behind left-side defender José Holebas, scoring on a through-ball and a cross from Cholevas&#x27; side. Petr Čech&#x27;s gaffe on a Georgios Samaras cross in the second half turned into a gift goal for Theofanis Gekas. The Czechs then eased off on their early pressure, opting to sit back and guard their lead for much of the second half, but Gekas&#x27; goal was too little too late. Greece lost the match 2–1, placing them at the foot of Group A in need of a victory over the attack-minded Russians to advance to the knockout rounds.

After thrashing the Czech Republic 4–1 and displaying more offensive potency in a 1–1 draw with Poland, the Russians were favored to earn the one point they needed to advance against the Greeks, especially since defeating the team in both of the previous two European Championships. However, Greece delivered a trademark 1–0 defensive victory and advanced to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals. Greece scored when Russia defender Sergei Ignashevich errantly headed a Greece throw-in behind the Russian defense for Giorgos Karagounis to pounce on. Greece&#x27;s captain sprinted in on goal and struck the ball at the back post under keeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in first-half stoppage time to send the Russians reeling into the locker rooms. Ignashevich appeared to have conceded an additional golden scoring opportunity for Greece upon tripping Karagounis in the Russian penalty area early in the second half, but referee Jonas Eriksson instead booked Karagounis for what he believed to be simulation. This being Karagounis&#x27; second yellow card of the tournament, Greece was to be without its suspended captain in the next round. With that victory, Greece qualified to the quarterfinals for a second time after their successful Euro 2004 campaign.

====Quarter-finals====
In the quarter-finals, Greece met with a Germany side that won all three of its group matches against Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands. Greece applied very little pressure in the midfield in the opening period, slowing the tempo of the game and affording Germany the majority of possession. Young Sotiris Ninis switched off momentarily in defence, allowing German captain Philipp Lahm to cut infield and open the scoring with a long-distance strike. Greece remained calm as in Georgios Samaras they carried a constant threat. On the counter-attack, they pulled level early in the second half; regaining possession in their defensive third, Giorgos Fotakis found Dimitris Salpingidis streaking 40 yards deep into German territory. Salpingidis delivered a ball five yards in front of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, which Samaras was able to meet and power underneath Neuer for the equalizer. Twenty minutes later, however, the Germans led 4–1. Greece scored an 89th-minute penalty kick by Salpingidis, but the match ended 4–2 to the Germans, ending Greece&#x27;s Euro 2012 campaign.

=== 2014 World Cup ===

====Qualifying====
To reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Greece had to contend with a team on the rise in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a dangerous Slovakian side seemingly in decline since its memorable 2010 World Cup qualifying and finals performances. Latvia, a familiar qualification foe for Greece in its previous two major tournaments (2010 World Cup, Euro 2012), joined the fray as well. Ahead of those aforesaid tournaments, Bosnia twice narrowly missed out on its first major international tournament appearance due to consecutive playoff defeats at the hands of Portugal. No playoff would be necessary for Bosnia in 2013, as it won its qualifying group over Greece on goal difference. The decisive match was in Bosnia on 22 March, when Greece succumbed to three set-piece goals (two free-kick headers and one penalty miss rebound) in a 3–1 defeat. Greece&#x27;s defense proved rigid throughout qualifying, conceding zero goals in open play. Four goals were allowed by Greece in ten games, the first of which was a penalty by Latvia, and yet four goals were too many for a relatively unproductive Grece attack to overcome. Though Greece was shut out just once, the team only managed to score 12 goals, an output Bosnia reached in its second game.

Following group play Romania, which claimed second place over Hungary and Turkey in a group dominated by the Dutch, awaited Greece in a two-legged playoff. The last time the two sides met in late 2011, Romania came into Greece and dealt Fernando Santos his first defeat as manager in his 18th game at the bench. Greece reversed the prior 3–1 result in their favour this time, scoring each goal through skillful one-touch passing and finishing. Kostas Mitroglou accounted for three of Greece&#x27;s four goals in a 4–2 aggregate playoff victory, though none were actual game-winners. Dimitris Salpingidis notched the game winner in Athens, while the second leg finished 1–1 in Bucharest.

====Finals====
Aracaju was chosen as the team&#x27;s base camp for the tournament in Brazil. Greece was drawn into Group C with Colombia, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Japan and ultimately created an extraordinarily similar tournament experience as it did two years prior at Euro 2012. Greece conceded an early goal in their first game against Colombia, but Panagiotis Kone narrowly missed equalizing just one minute after Colombia&#x27;s fifth-minute goal. Trailing 2–0 in the 63rd minute, Theofanis Gekas&#x27; header from six yards struck the crossbar for Greece&#x27;s best chance of the match. The Colombians proved to be the more clinical finishers, prevailing 3–0 despite an even number of shots for both teams and a slight possession advantage in Greece&#x27;s favor. To stave off the threat of elimination, the Greece needed to earn at least a point in their second match with Japan, who sat alongside them at the bottom of Group C. The task grew more difficult once captain Kostas Katsouranis received two yellow cards, reducing Greece to ten men in the 38th minute. Greece held out for a 0–0 draw and remained tied with Japan on points. The draw made it necessary for Greece to defeat Ivory Coast in their final group match in order to reach the round of 16 for the first time in their history. An early injury to midfielder Panagiotis Kone brought on young Olympiacos midfielder Andreas Samaris, who would score his first international goal after intercepting a poor back-pass by an Ivorian defender. Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony equalized for Ivory Coast in the 73rd minute. In the first minute of stoppage time, Ivory Coast striker Giovanni Sio obstructed a Samaras shot by clipping him from behind in the Ivorian penalty area, resulting in a Greece penalty kick which Samaras converted with 30 seconds remaining in the game, prompting wild celebrations in Greece.

As Group C runners-up Greece was paired in the round of 16 with Group D shock winners Costa Rica, who won their first-ever World Cup group stage ahead of former world champions Uruguay, Italy and England. Trailing 1–0 but handed an advantage by the dismissal of Costa Rican Óscar Duarte, Greece forced extra time through a Sokratis Papastathopoulos equalizer ten seconds into stoppage time. This was the only goal that Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas conceded in open play throughout the tournament. Navas thwarted several opportunities for Greece throughout the 30 minutes of extra time and saved Theofanis Gekas&#x27; penalty in the game&#x27;s concluding penalty shootout. Costa Rica claimed its first World Cup knockout stage victory and denied Greece its first by defeating Greece 5–3 on penalties.

===After 2014===

====Euro 2016 qualifying: Reorganisation and decline====

The team appointed Claudio Ranieri as head coach in July 2014. He was sacked in November of the same year after a shocking home defeat to the Faroe Islands. Sergio Markarián was appointed in his place, but he too has come under fire, after the team&#x27;s terrible performances in the remaining UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. The team&#x27;s form after September 2014 proved to be abysmal, with no wins in over a year. Greece finished in bottom place in their Euro Qualifying group, earning just one victory against Hungary in the final round, and failing to qualify for the tournament. Greece, along with the Netherlands and Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only nations from Pot 1 not to qualify for the finals. Those three had taken part in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Incidentally, the three teams would also fail to qualify for the World Cup in 2018.

====2018 World Cup qualifying: Resurgence====

In attempting to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Greece would suffer a second successive failure to reach a major tournament, despite improvements and some positive results. They finished second in Group H of the European qualifying stages, nine points behind runaway leaders Belgium and two points clear of third placed Bosnia and Herzegovina. Greece were subsequently drawn against Croatia in the play-off round, where they were knocked out over two legs; a 4–1 away defeat set the tone for Greece&#x27;s campaign and in the second leg, they drew a blank in a 0–0 stalemate against the Croats to signify the end of their World Cup hopes.

====2018–19 Nations League and Euro 2020 qualifying: Inconsistency, fall and promising finish====

Greece had to start their UEFA Nations League in League C due to previously poor performance. Greece won and lost three games each to these opponents altogether, and only finished third in the Nations League and was unable to promote to League B when the UEFA revised the format.

Greece&#x27;s qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2020 commenced with the team being placed in Group J. Due to disappointing results, John van &#x27;t Schip decided not to call-up some of the leading members of the squad, such as Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Kostas Manolas for their final matches. A more youthful Greek showed a massive improvement in their attacking and pressing style of play. In the final three games Greece achieved successive victories. Greece finished third in the final table but this was still not enough to earn a play-off spot.

====2020–21 Nations League and 2022 World Cup qualifying====

Having been forced to remain in League C due to poor performance, Greece had to start its campaign on their quest to be promoted. Greece needed a win in the last game against Slovenia at home to achieve promotion to League B. The match ended on 0-0, with Greece failing to promote a second consecutive time, despite being unbeaten and having conceded just one goal.

Greece was put in Group B for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The campaign started with an upset away 1–1 draw against group favourites Spain, but was followed by two 1-1 draws to Georgia at home and Kosovo away. A 2–1 home win over Sweden kept the hopes for qualification alive, and was followed by a 2–0 away win against Georgia. At the crucial away match in Stockholm, Greece made a good performance in the first half but eventually lost 2–0 to Sweden. Another loss, 1–0 at home to group winners Spain ratified Greece&#x27;s elimination from the finals, with Greece failing to qualify for a World Cup for the second consecutive time.

====2022–23 Nations League and Euro 2024 qualifying====
Under the instructions of manager Gus Poyet, Greece had a successful run in the Group C2 of the 2022–23 competition. The &quot;Galanolefki&quot; secured promotion to League B by topping the group ahead of Kosovo, Northern Ireland, and Cyprus.

Their Nations League success guaranteed them a playoff spot should they not qualify directly. They subsequently were put into the Group B for the Euro 2024 qualifiers along with the Netherlands, France, the Republic of Ireland, and Gibraltar. After they finished third in their group, they qualified for the playoffs due to their Nations League success. In the semi-final of the Path C play-off, Greece won comfortably at home against Kazakhstan (5–0), scoring 2 goals in the first quarter-hour and taking a 4-goal lead at half-time. However, they were eliminated in the play-off final away by Georgia on penalties (2–4) after a goalless draw throughout 120 minutes.

====2024–25 Nations League and World Cup 2026 qualifying====
Greece entered its new UEFA Nations League campaign under the helm of Ivan Jovanović, who signed a 2-year contract. On 10 October 2024, they upset England at Wembley Stadium, defeating them 2–1. Vangelis Pavlidis, who scored both of Greece&#x27;s goals, dedicated them to the late George Baldock. Ultimately, Greece would finish second of the table, having lost to England 3–0 in the reverse fixture that condemned the Greeks to second due to inferior goal difference, but secured a place for the promotion play-offs, where they will face Scotland in March 2025.

==Home stadium== 
Traditionally, Greece has spent most of its history playing home matches in different stadiums primarily in or near Athens, as well as in various other cities across the country. The national team&#x27;s home ground was the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus from its reconstruction in 2004 until 2017. 

Since their first international fixture in 1929 and for the next 33 years, Greece regularly used the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium as their home ground. Their first home match away from it was played at the Nikos Goumas Stadium in 1962, and the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for the first time in 1964 after it was renovated. In 1966, Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki became the first venue outside Athens to host the national team. From then on, these stadiums were alternated until the early 1980s, along with others like Thessaloniki&#x27;s Toumba Stadium and Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium, inaugurated in 1975 and 1977, respectively. Greece also played home matches at other venues such as Kostas Davourlis Stadium in Patras and Anthi Karagianni Stadium in Kavala during the 1970s. In 1982, the Georgios Kamaras Stadium was added to the list of Athens-based home grounds.

On 16 November 1983, the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium, the largest in the country, hosted the national team for the first time in a UEFA Euro 1984 qualifier against Denmark. It served as the primary home ground throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until it closed for renovations in 2001. During this period, matches were also held at other stadiums, both in Athens and in provincial cities. From the early 2000s, the Athens Olympic Stadium was gradually used less frequently. Between 2000 and the Euro 2004 qualifiers, Greece returned to using the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. From 2004 onwards, the Karaiskakis Stadium became the primary home venue, with few matches played elsewhere. In 2018, Greece returned to the OAKA for a friendly against Switzerland and announced it as the home ground for the UEFA Nations League. 

For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, Greece initially planned to split matches between OAKA in Athens and the Pankritio Stadium in Heraklion, Crete. However, as the latter required upgrades to meet FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens. They remained at OAKA until 2021, before making a temporary move to the Georgios Kamaras Stadium later that year for the UEFA Nations League, with two matches also hosted in Volos.

On 7 March 2023, it was announced that the newly built Agia Sophia Stadium in Nea Filadelfeia, Athens, would become the national team&#x27;s new home ground. However, for the 2024 Nations League campaign, Greece returned to the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus for the first time since 2017.


The following list contains foreign stadiums where Greece has been considered the home team. This list includes friendlies, FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship matches.

==Team image==

Greece&#x27;s traditional colors are blue and white, originating from the Greece flag. Although blue was used as the home kit since the team&#x27;s inception, white became the primary home color following UEFA Euro 2004. In recent decades, Greece has worn either a set of white jerseys, shorts, and socks or an all-blue combination. Formerly, the kit consisted of a combination of blue jerseys and white shorts and vice versa. Meanwhile, Greece&#x27;s kit has occasionally featured stripes, crosses, or other designs, as well as various values of blue.

On 10 April 2013, the Hellenic Football Federation announced a partnership with American manufacturer Nike, which is Greece&#x27;s current official supplier, with their first kit debuting on 7 June 2013 in the away match to Lithuania. On 4 March 2014, Greece unveiled their latest kit also worn at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

The crest (&quot;εθνόσημο&quot; means &quot;national sign&quot;), which is used in the kit, is the official emblem of the national team.

===Kit sponsorship===
===Nicknames===
Traditionally, Greece is referred to by the media and the Greeks in general simply as &quot;Ethniki&quot; (Εθνική) in Greek, which means &#x27;National&#x27;. The team is often called &quot;Galanolefki&quot; (Sky blue-white) due to the use of the colors of the Greece flag as kit colors. Both nicknames are used for the country&#x27;s national teams in other sports as well.

During the opening ceremony at the UEFA Euro 2004, which took place right before the inaugural game of the tournament between Greece and hosts Portugal, a replica of a 16th-century ship was used referring to the expeditions of the Portuguese explorers of that time. Greek radio sports journalist Georgios Helakis, while broadcasting the opening match, commented that &quot;since the Portuguese team appeared in such a ship, it&#x27;s time for us to become pirates and steal the victory&quot;. Eventually, Greece beat the hosts and the team was described as &quot;Piratiko&quot;, meaning the &#x27;Pirate ship&#x27;, which emerged as the new nickname of the team repeated with every win during the tournament. Especially after Greece won in the final to Portugal, the new nickname was established to commemorate the coronation of Greece as European champions.

=== Rivalries ===

Greece has a historical rivalry with Turkey; having played them a total of 13 matches, winning three, drawing three, and losing seven games. Both countries have been described as &quot;punching above their weight&quot;; with Greece winning Euro 2004 despite being classified as underdogs before the competition, and Turkey followed-up their World Cup semi-final appearance in 2002 by advancing to the semi-finals of Euro 2008, where they were knocked out by Germany. The relationship with Turkey is very intense overall. It is fueled by a dispute between the two countries, the dispute over Cyprus, and several incidents occurring during matches between Turkish and Greek clubs, it has been described as one of the most intense international football rivalries.

Greece has also developed a rivalry with Romania, due to the number of times they have met in their history, with 36 matches being played across all competitions, including friendlies. Greece has won 8 matches and Romania has won 18 matches, with 10 matches between them ending in a draw.

<text>Tor Books is the primary imprint of Tor Publishing Group (previously Tom Doherty Associates), a publishing company based in New York City. It primarily publishes science fiction and fantasy titles.

==History==
Tor was founded by Tom Doherty, Harriet McDougal, and Jim Baen in 1980. (Baen founded his own imprint three years later.) They were soon joined by Barbara Doherty and Katherine Pendill, who then composed the original startup team. 

&quot;&quot; is a word meaning a rocky pinnacle, as depicted in Tor&#x27;s logo. Tor Books was sold to St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 1987. Along with St. Martin&#x27;s Press; Henry Holt; and Farrar, Straus and Giroux, it became part of the Holtzbrinck group, now part of Macmillan in the US.

In June 2019, Tor and other Macmillan imprints moved from the Flatiron Building, to larger offices in the Equitable Building.

==Imprints==
Tor is the primary imprint of Tor Publishing Group. The Forge imprint publishes an array of fictional titles, including historical novels and thrillers. The Nightfire imprint publishes horror, largely but not exclusively with science fiction and fantasy elements. The Bramble imprint publishes romance and romantic stories with elements of other genres. Tor Books has two imprints for young readers: Starscape (for readers 10 years of age and up) and Tor Teen (for readers 13 years of age and up). The Tordotcom imprint focuses on short works such as novellas, shorter novels and serializations.

A United Kingdom sister imprint, Tor UK, specializes in science fiction, fantasy, and horror, and publishes young-adult crossover fiction based on computer-game franchises. Tor UK briefly maintained an open submission policy, which ended in January 2013.

Orb Books publishes science-fiction classics such as A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;Slan&quot;.

Tor Teen publishes young-adult novels such as Cory Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Little Brother&quot; and repackages novels such as Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; for younger readers.

Tor Labs produces podcasts.

A German sister imprint, Fischer Tor, was founded in August 2016 as an imprint of S. Fischer Verlag (which also belongs to Holtzbrinck Publishing Group). It publishes international titles translated into German, as well as original German works. Fischer Tor also publishes the German online magazine &quot;Tor Online&quot;, which is based on the same concept as the English &quot;Tor.com&quot; online magazine, but has its own independent content.

==Ebooks==
Tor publishes a range of its works as ebooks and, in 2012, Doherty announced that his imprints would sell only DRM-free ebooks by July of that year. One year later, Tor stated that the removal of DRM had not harmed its ebook business, so they would continue selling them DRM-free.

In July 2018, Macmillan Publishers and Tor prompted a boycott spread across social media websites and library bulletin boards after they announced that Tor&#x27;s e-books would no longer be made available for libraries to purchase and lend to borrowers, via digital distribution services such as OverDrive, until four months after their initial publication date. The company cited the &quot;direct and adverse impact&quot; of electronic lending on retail eBook sales but suggested that the change was part of a &quot;test program&quot; and could be reevaluated.

==Accolades==
Tor won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Publisher in 33 consecutive years from 1988 to 2022 inclusive.

In March 2014, &quot;Worlds Without End&quot; listed Tor as the second-most awarded and nominated publisher of science fiction, fantasy and horror books, after Gollancz. At that time, Tor had received 316 nominations and 54 wins for 723 published novels, written by 197 authors. In the following year, Tor surpassed Gollancz to become the top publisher on the list.

By March 2018, Tor&#x27;s record had increased to 579 nominations and 111 wins, across 16 tracked awards given in the covered genres, with a total of 2,353 published novels written by 576 authors.

<text>Fauna (: faunae or faunas) is all of the animal life present in a particular region or time. The corresponding terms for plants and fungi are &quot;flora&quot; and &quot;funga&quot;, respectively. Flora, fauna, funga and other forms of life are collectively referred to as &quot;biota&quot;. Zoologists and paleontologists use &quot;fauna&quot; to refer to a typical collection of animals found in a specific time or place, e.g. the &quot;Sonoran Desert fauna&quot; or the &quot;Burgess Shale fauna&quot;. Paleontologists sometimes refer to a sequence of faunal stages, which is a series of rocks all containing similar fossils. The study of animals of a particular region is called faunistics.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Fauna&quot; comes from the name Fauna, a Roman goddess of earth and fertility, the Roman god Faunus, and the related forest spirits called Fauns. All three words are cognates of the name of the Greek god Pan, and &quot;panis&quot; is the Modern Greek equivalent of fauna (πανίς or rather πανίδα). &quot;Fauna&quot; is also the word for a book that catalogues the animals in such a manner. The term was first used by Carl Linnaeus from Sweden in the title of his 1745 work &quot;Fauna Suecica&quot;.

== Subdivisions on the basis of region ==
=== Cryofauna ===
&quot;Cryofauna&quot; refers to the animals that live in, or very close to, cold areas.

===Cryptofauna===
&quot;Cryptofauna&quot; is the fauna that exists in protected or concealed microhabitats.

=== Epifauna ===
Epifauna, also called &quot;epibenthos&quot;, are aquatic animals that live on the bottom substratum as opposed to within it, that is, the benthic fauna that live on top of the sediment surface at the seafloor.

=== Infauna ===

&quot;Infauna&quot; are benthic organisms that live within the bottom substratum of a water body, especially within the bottom-most oceanic sediments, the layer of small particles at the bottom of a body of water, rather than on its surface. Bacteria and microalgae may also live in the interstices of bottom sediments. In general, infaunal animals become progressively smaller and less abundant with increasing water depth and distance from shore, whereas bacteria show more constancy in abundance, tending toward one million cells per milliliter of interstitial seawater.

Such creatures are found in the fossil record and include lingulata, trilobites and worms. They made burrows in the sediment as protection and may also have fed upon detritus or the mat of microbes which tended to grow on the surface of the sediment. Today, a variety of organisms live in and disturb the sediment. The deepest burrowers are the ghost shrimps (&quot;Thalassinidea&quot;), which go as deep as into the sediment at the bottom of the ocean.

=== Limnofauna ===
&quot;Limnofauna&quot; refers to the animals that live in fresh water.

=== Macrofauna ===
&quot;Macrofauna&quot; are benthic or soil organisms which are retained on a 0.5 mm sieve. Studies in the deep sea define macrofauna as animals retained on a 0.3 mm sieve to account for the small size of many of the taxa.

=== Megafauna ===
&quot;Megafauna&quot; are large animals of any particular region or time. For example, Australian megafauna.

=== Meiofauna ===

&quot;Meiofauna&quot; are small benthic invertebrates that live in both marine and freshwater environments. The term &quot;meiofauna&quot; loosely defines a group of organisms by their 
size, larger than microfauna but smaller than macrofauna, rather than a taxonomic grouping. One environment for meiofauna is between grains of damp sand (see Mystacocarida).

In practice these are metazoan animals that can pass unharmed through a 0.5–1 mm mesh but will be retained by a 30–45 μm mesh, but the exact dimensions will vary from researcher to researcher. Whether an organism passes through a 1 mm mesh also depends upon whether it is alive or dead at the time of sorting.

=== Mesofauna ===

&quot;Mesofauna&quot; are macroscopic soil animals such as arthropods or nematodes. Mesofauna are extremely diverse; considering just the springtails (Collembola), as of 1998, approximately 6,500 species had been identified.

===Microfauna===
Microfauna are microscopic or very small animals (usually including protozoans and very small animals such as rotifers). To qualify as microfauna, an organism must exhibit animal-like characteristics, as opposed to microflora, which are more plant-like.

=== Stygofauna ===

Stygofauna is any fauna that lives in groundwater systems or aquifers, such as caves, fissures and vugs. Stygofauna and troglofauna are the two types of subterranean fauna (based on life-history). Both are associated with subterranean environments – stygofauna is associated with water, and troglofauna with caves and spaces above the water table. Stygofauna can live within freshwater aquifers and within the spaces of limestone, calcrete or laterite, whilst larger animals can be found in cave waters and wells. Stygofaunal animals, like troglofauna, are divided into three groups based on their life history - stygophiles, stygoxenes, and stygobites.

=== Troglofauna ===
Troglofauna are small cave-dwelling animals that have adapted to their dark surroundings. Troglofauna and stygofauna are the two types of subterranean fauna (based on life-history). Both are associated with subterranean environments – troglofauna is associated with caves and spaces above the water table and stygofauna with water. Troglofaunal species include spiders, insects, myriapods and others. Some troglofauna live permanently underground and cannot survive outside the cave environment. Troglofauna adaptations and characteristics include a heightened sense of hearing, touch and smell. Loss of under-used senses is apparent in the lack of pigmentation as well as eyesight in most troglofauna. Troglofauna insects may exhibit a lack of wings and longer appendages.

=== Xenofauna ===

&quot;Xenofauna&quot;, theoretically, are alien organisms that can be described as animal analogues. While no alien life forms, animal-like or otherwise, are known definitively, the concept of alien life remains a subject of great interest in fields like astronomy, astrobiology, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, science fiction, and philosophy.

=== Other ===
Other terms include &quot;avifauna&quot;, which means &quot;bird fauna&quot; and &quot;piscifauna&quot; (or &quot;ichthyofauna&quot;), which means &quot;fish fauna&quot;.

<text>The League of European Research Universities (LERU) is a consortium of European research universities.

==History and overview==
The League of European Research Universities (LERU) is an association of research-intensive universities. Founded in 2002, as a partnership among twelve multi-faculty research universities, in 2024 it expanded its membership to twenty-four. As the latest addition, ETH Zurich joined the alliance on 1 January 2024. The purpose of the League is to influence policy in Europe and to develop best practice through mutual exchange of experience. LERU regularly publishes a variety of papers and reports which make high-level policy statements, provide analyses and make recommendations for policymakers, universities, researchers and other stakeholders.

LERU is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium. Kurt Deketelaere is the current Secretary-General. Linda Doyle is the current Chair.

==Membership==
Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, one of the 12 founding member of the LERU, voluntarily left the group in March 2011. The 24 member universities as of 2024 are:

<text>Teunis (Ton) Sijbrands (born 15 December 1949, in Amsterdam) is a Dutch international draughts player who became world champion in 1972. The next year, he successfully defended his title in a match against Andris Andreiko.

In 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973 and 1988 he was the national Dutch champion. Sijbrands also had a weekly column about draughts in the Dutch national newspaper &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; and wrote several books about the game.

He also made major achievements in simultaneous blindfold draughts. In 2002 he won 17 games and played 5 draws from a total 22 games, which equals a score of approximately 88%.

On 18 December 2004, in the Dutch village of Lutten, Sijbrands improved the world record for blindfold simultaneous draughts. In this attempt that lasted 24 hours, he won 20 out of 24 games; the other 4 were draws, which equals a score of about 92%. At his next attempt, on 5 October 2007 at Tilburg University, he broke his own record again. This time he played 25 games, winning 21 and drawing 4. After losing the record to his compatriot Erno Prosman, Sijbrands regained it in September 2009 when he played 28 simultaneous games, winning 18, drawing 7 and losing 3. Prosman recovered the world record on 7 July 2012 in Gouda, Netherlands. He played 30 games, winning 17, losing 5 with 8 draws, a score of exactly 70%.

Sijbrands regained the world record once more on 19–21 December 2014 in Hilversum, Netherlands. He played 32 games with 14 wins and 18 draws.

<text>The  ( ; , &quot;hrn&quot;; sign: ₴; code: UAH) has been the national currency of Ukraine since 2 September 1996. The hryvnia is divided into 100 kopiykas (). It is named after a measure of weight used in Kievan Rus&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The currency of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 11th century was the &quot;grivna&quot;. The word is thought to derive from the Slavic &quot;griva&quot;; which compares with the Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, and Serbo-Croatian word (&quot;griva&quot;, meaning &quot;mane&quot;). It might have indicated something valuable to be worn around the neck, that was usually made of silver or gold, and may be related to the Bulgarian and Serbian term &quot;grivna&quot; (, &quot;bracelet&quot;).

Following Ukraine&#x27;s declared secession from Russia in 1917, the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic named its currency hryvnia after the grivna of Kievan Rus&#x27;; these were designed by Heorhiy Narbut.

The word was used to describe silver or gold ingots of a certain weight.

==Currency sign==
The hryvnia sign is a cursive Ukrainian letter He (&quot;г&quot;), with a double horizontal stroke (₴), symbolizing stability, similar to that used in other currency symbols such as the yen and Chinese yuan (¥, a symbol the currencies share), euro (€), and Indian rupee (₹). The sign was encoded as U+20B4 in Unicode 4.1 and released in 2005. It is now supported by most systems. In Ukraine, if the hryvnia sign is unavailable, the Cyrillic abbreviation &quot;грн&quot; is used (which can be transliterated as &quot;hrn&quot;).

==History==

On 22 December 1917, the Central Rada established Ukraine&#x27;s state bank. The karbovanets became first currency of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. On 5 January 1918, the first official 100 karbovanets banknote was issued, signed by Mykhailo Kryvetskyi, the first director of the state bank.

On 1 March 1918, the Central Council introduced a new currency, the hryvnia, consisting of 100 shahs and equaled to 1/2 of the previously issued karbovanets banknote.

In April 1918, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky reintroduced the karbovanets as the main currency of Ukraine. It consisted of 200 shahs, and denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 1,000 karbovanets were issued.

During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine in World War II, the German occupying government (Reichskommissariat Ukraine) issued banknotes denominated in karbovanets (&quot;karbowanez&quot; in German).

The third version of the karbovanets replaced rubles at par in 1992. The karbovanets was subject to hyperinflation in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The karbovanets was replaced by the hryvnia in September 1996, at a rate of 1 hryvnia to 100,000 karbovanets.

The introduction of the hryvnia was done in a covert fashion. It was introduced according to the Presidential Decree of 26 August 1996, published three days later. During the transition period, 2–16 September, both hryvnias and karbovanets could be used, but change could only be given in hryvnias. All bank accounts were converted to hryvnias automatically. During the transition period, 97% of karbovanets were taken out of circulation, with 56% being removed in the first five days of the currency reform. After 16 September 1996, any remaining karbovanets in circulation could be exchanged for hryvnias in banks.

The hryvnia was introduced when the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine was Viktor Yushchenko, but the new banknotes bore the signature of the previous chairman, Vadym Hetman. The first notes had been printed in 1992 by the Canadian Bank Note Company, but it was decided to delay their circulation until the hyperinflation in Ukraine had been brought under control.

On 18 March 2014, following the Russian annexation of Crimea, the interim administration of the Republic of Crimea announced that the hryvnia was to be dropped as the region&#x27;s currency the following month. It was replaced by the Russian ruble on 21 March 2014; the hryvnia was allowed to be used for cash payments until 1 June. Because of a lack of low-denomination Russian rubles in those raions of the Donbas under the control of the pro-Russian separatist states of Donetsk and Luhansk, the hryvnia remained the predominant currency until 2022.

==Coinage==

Coins were first struck for the new currency in 1992, but were not introduced until September 1996. Initially, coins valued between 1 and 50 kopiyky were issued. In March 1997, ₴1 coins were added. Since 2004, commemorative ₴1 coins have been struck.

In October 2012, the National Bank of Ukraine announced that it was examining the possibility of withdrawing the 1 and 2 kopiyky coins from circulation, as they had become too expensive to produce. After 2013, 1 and 2 kopiyky coins were not produced, but remained in circulation until 1 October 2019. On 26 October 2012, the National Bank of Ukraine announced it was considering the introduction of a ₴2 coin. Officially, as of 1 July 2016, 12.4 billion coins, with a face value of ₴1.4 billion were in circulation. On 1 October 2019, 1, 2 and 5 kopiyky coins ceased to be legal tender. They can be still changed at banks.

==Banknotes==

In 1996, the first series of hryvnia banknotes was introduced into circulation by the National Bank of Ukraine. They were dated 1992 and were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 hryvnias. The design of the banknotes was developed by Ukrainian artists Vasyl Lopata and Borys Maksymov. The one hryvnia banknotes were printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company in 1992. The two, five and ten hryvnia banknotes were printed two years later. The banknotes were stored in Canada until they were put into circulation.

Banknotes of the first series in denominations of 50 and 100 hryvnias also existed but were not introduced because these nominals were not needed in the economic crisis of the mid-1990s.

Also in 1996, the 1, 50, and 100 hryvnia notes of the second series were introduced, with 1 hryvnia dated 1994. The banknotes were designed and printed by Britain&#x27;s De La Rue. Since the opening of the Mint of the National Bank of Ukraine in cooperation with De La Rue in March 1994, all banknotes have been printed in Ukraine.

Later, higher denominations were added. The 200 hryvnia notes of the second series were introduced in 2001, followed by the 500 hryvnia notes of the third series in 2006, and 1000 hryvnia notes of fourth series in 2019.

The 100 hryvnia denomination is quite common due to its moderately high value. Also common is the 200 and 500 hryvnia, as most Ukrainian ATMs dispense currency in these denominations.

In 2016, the NBU paper factory started producing banknote paper using flax instead of cotton.

In 2019, the National Bank of Ukraine introduced a 1,000 hryvnia banknote and was issued into circulation on 25 October 2019. The introduction of the new banknote was in response to the National Bank of Ukraine&#x27;s efforts of streamlining the number of coins and banknotes already in circulation. The 1, 2, 5 and 10 hryvnia banknotes will continue to be legal tender alongside its equivalent coins in general circulation, while being withdrawn from circulation from repeated use in commerce.

In 2019, the National Bank of Ukraine introduced a revised 50 hryvnia banknote into circulation on 20 December 2019 and issued a revised 200 hryvnia banknote on 25 February 2020, thereby completing the family of notes which began with the issuance of the 100 hryvnia banknote in 2015.

===Current series===
==Exchange rates==
Official NBU exchange rate at moment of introduction was UAH 1.76 per 1 US dollar.

Following the Asian financial crisis in 1998, the currency was devalued to UAH 5.6 = USD 1.00 in February 2000. Later, the exchange rate remained relatively stable at around 5.4 hryvnias for 1 US dollar and was fixed to 5.05 hryvnias for 1 US dollar from 21 April 2005 until 21 May 2008. In mid-October 2008 rapid devaluation began, in the course of a global financial crisis that hit Ukraine hard, with the hryvnia dropping 38.4% from UAH 4.85 for 1 US dollar on 23 September 2008 to UAH 7.88 for 1 US dollar on 19 December 2008. After a period of instability, a new peg of 8 hryvnias per US dollar was established, remaining for several years. In 2012, the peg was changed to a managed float (much like that of the Chinese yuan) as the euro and other European countries&#x27; currencies weakened against the dollar due to the European debt crisis, and the value in mid-2012 was about ₴8.14 per dollar.

As from 7 February 2014, following political instability in Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine changed the hryvnia into a fluctuating/floating currency in an attempt to meet IMF requirements and to try to enforce a stable price for the currency in the Forex market. In 2014 and 2015, the hryvnia lost about 70% of its value against the U.S. dollar, with the currency reaching a record low of ₴33 per dollar in February 2015.

On 31 July 2019, the hryvnia to U.S. dollar exchange rate in the interbank foreign exchange market strengthened to ₴24.98 — the highest level in 3 years.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the official exchange rate of hryvnia was fixed at ₴29.25 per U.S. dollar and ₴33.17 per euro. On 21 July 2022, it was devalued to ₴36.5686 per US dollar, to bring it into alignment with the black market.

The international mid-market exchange rate fluctuates, but values the hryvnia slightly lower than the official rate.

<doc id="722700" wikidata="Q2605020" url="?curid=722700" title="Okopy, Ternopil Oblast">
<text>Okopy () is a selo in western Ukraine. It is located in Chortkiv Raion (district) of Ternopil Oblast (province), and had its origins as a Polish fortress at the meeting of the Zbruch and Dniester rivers. It belongs to Melnytsia-Podilska settlement hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. 

The current estimated population is around 557 (as of 2005).

==Name==
The settlement was previously referred to as Okopy Svyatoyi Triytsi (; ; ), translated as the &quot;Trenches of the Holy Trinity&quot;. This name came from the fact that the fortress for the town was entrenched on the top of the mountain.

==History==
The stronghold and the neighbouring town were built in 1692, by Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski, Grand Hetman of the Crown. The site was chosen by King Jan III Sobieski of Poland, as a measure to stop a possible attack from the nearby Turkish-seized fortresses of Kamieniec Podolski, twenty kilometers away, and Chocim, eight kilometers away. The fortress was expanded by Tylman of Gameren, one of the most notable Polish architects of the time.

The site is a natural fortress: a small strip of high rocks linking the Zbruch and Dnister rivers. Tylman of Gameren decided to build a double line of fortifications (two rampart lines of bastion system) with two gates leading east- (&quot;Kamieniec Gate&quot;) and westwards (&quot;Lwów Gate&quot;). Other directions were defended by towered walls and natural escarpments over the river banks, with walls stretching along both sides of isthmus on the edge of steep slope to the river. The construction was started under the command of the General of Horse Artillery, Marcin Katski, and the works were finished in the same year. The nearby village was also fortified. In 1693 Jan III Sobieski built a votive church in the compound. Israel ben Eliezer, a Jewish mystical rabbi and the founder of the Hasidic Jewish movement, was born in Okopy in 1698 (although he later lived in nearby Tluste).The stronghold was abandoned in 1699, when the rest of Podolia was returned to Poland, and the fortress lost its importance as a counterbalance to Kamieniec Podolski. In 1769, the Bar Confederacy, defended the stronghold against the besieging forces of Russia. The defence was commanded by the future Hero of the American Revolutionary War, Kazimierz Pułaski.

After the Partitions of Poland in 1772, the village and the ruins of the stronghold became the easternmost point of Austrian Galicia. The nearby town was abandoned, and the inhabitants of the village moved inside the fortress walls. Most of the houses that were built were made from the stones that had been used to construct the earlier defensive walls. The remaining parts of the stronghold (both gates, one of the forts, the ruins of the Holy Trinity church and parts of the walls) were partially restored in 1905 by count Mieczysław Dunin-Borkowski.

After the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1920, the site was made part of Poland, in the Tarnopol Voivodship, near the Polish border with the Soviet Union and Romania. The 14th battalion of the Border Defence Corps were stationed there. In the interbellum, the village was known for its wineries and peach orchards. It became a holidays center for the inhabitants of the nearby cities of Ternopil, and Lviv.

After the World War II, the site was annexed by the Soviet Union. The village was renamed &quot;Okopy&quot; and was turned into a Kolkhoz, and soon totally depopulated, as a result of the forced migration of Poles to Siberia.

The ruins of the stronghold can be found in the western part of the village.

The name of the fortress was popularized in Poland by Zygmunt Krasiński&#x27;s usage of it in his drama &quot;Nie-Boska komedia&quot; (&quot;The Un-divine Comedy&quot;,1835).

Until 18 July 2020, Okopy belonged to Borshchiv Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ternopil Oblast to three. The area of Borshchiv Raion was merged into Chortkiv Raion.

<text>The Cyprus national football team (, ) represents Cyprus in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Cyprus Football Association. The team&#x27;s home ground is the AEK Arena in Larnaca.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The team&#x27;s first match took place on 23 July 1949, one year after becoming a member of the world governing body FIFA: a friendly against Maccabi Tel Aviv in Tel Aviv, ending in a 3–3 draw. Seven days later, the team had its first international game: a 3–1 defeat by Israel in the same city.

In November 1960, following independence from British rule, Cyprus drew its first post-independence official match 1–1 against Israel, as part of the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualifying tournament. Cyprus&#x27; first international victory was a 3–1 win over Greece on 27 November 1963 in a friendly. On 17 February 1968, Cyprus recorded their first competitive win, beating Switzerland 2–1 in a European Championship qualifying match in Old GSP Stadium in Nicosia.

In 1974, the national team enjoyed one of their most famous victories when they beat Northern Ireland 1–0 in Nicosia. On 12 February 1983, as part of the Euro 1984 qualifiers, Cyprus held world champions Italy to a 1–1 draw in Tsirio Stadium in Limassol, followed a month later by the same result against Czechoslovakia. Four years later, in the Euro 1988 qualification, Cyprus recorded their first ever point achieved in an away match, against Poland. In 1989 they drew 1–1 with France in the World Cup qualifying match. Despite a number of triumphs on home soil, Cyprus had to wait until 1992 to record their first away win: a 2–0 victory against the Faroe Islands.

Results in qualifying tournaments had improved considerably in the following years; In the qualifying stages for the 1996 UEFA European Championship, Cyprus drew 1–1 with holders Denmark. Four years later, they missed out on a place in the UEFA Euro 2000 despite 3–2 victories against both Spain and Israel and a 4–0 win over San Marino.

=== 2000s ===

On 15 November 2000, Cyprus scored their biggest win in history by beating Andorra in Limassol 5–0 in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification. On 7 October 2006, as part of the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Cyprus caused a major upset by beating the Republic of Ireland 5–2 at GSP Stadium in Nicosia, with Michalis Konstantinou and Constantinos Charalambidis each scoring two goals and Alexandros Garpozis finishing off the match. Just one month later, on 15 November 2006, they caused another surprise by holding the previous World Cup&#x27;s hosts Germany to a 1–1 draw at home. On 13 October 2007, they beat Wales 3–1 in Nicosia. On 17 October 2007, Cyprus came close to a historic away victory in Dublin against the Republic of Ireland, but the hosts equalised in the last minute of the game and the match ended 1–1. 

=== 2010s ===
On 3 September 2010, as part of the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Cyprus claimed a historic 4–4 draw against Portugal in Guimarães.

During the Euro 2016 qualification phase, managed by Pambos Christodoulou, Cyprus claimed one of their most historic victories by defeating 2014 World Cup participant Bosnia 2–1 in Zenica. In the last group match, the team faced Bosnia, needing a victory to finish 3rd and rely on Belgium to beat Israel in Brussels. As fate would have it, the Bosnians won the reverse leg 3–2 and qualified to the play-offs at the expense of the home team, who at one point took a 2–1 lead during the first half and for a number of minutes held onto 3rd place and a berth in the play-offs for the first time in history, as Belgium, a soon to be world number 1 side, were comfortably beating Israel at home.

Cyprus would finish behind Estonia and ahead of Gibraltar to place 5th of 6 teams in Group H in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Their qualification run would include an impressive 3–2 home victory over Bosnia.

=== 2020s ===
In the Euro 2020 qualifiers, Cyprus beat San Marino 5–0 but lost to Belgium and Scotland. Despite a 2–1 away win against Kazakhstan, they lost their last three games and finished 4th out of 6 teams in the group, just ahead of Kazakhstan and San Marino.

The 2020–21 UEFA Nations League ended a big disappointment for Cyprus. They lost their first three games against Montenegro, Azerbaijan, and Luxembourg, before drawing 0–0 with Azerbaijan in the fourth game. Even though they beat Luxembourg 2–1 at home, they were crushed 4–0 by Montenegro in the last game and finished last in their group. This meant that they had to face Estonia in the relegation play-offs, whom they defeated 2–0 on aggregate, with goals from Marinos Tzionis and Pieros Sotiriou. Results hardly improved in the next edition of the competition, as Cyprus finished last in their group with Greece, Kosovo, and Northern Ireland, earning five points (through a win against Greece and two draws against Northern Ireland).

Cyprus lost all eight of their games in the 2024 Euro qualifiers, finishing last in their group and marking their worst ever Euro qualification campaign in terms of points per game and goal difference.

==Kit==
On 7 October 2006, Diadora unveiled Cyprus&#x27; new kit. It outlines a map of Cyprus in amber from the shoulder to the sleeve, with a green line running down the middle to indicate the division of the island. This controversial kit was used for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying phase. Adidas then made Cyprus&#x27; kits for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification phases. In 2018, Macron replaced Adidas as part of UEFA&#x27;s Kit Assistance Scheme.

==Home stadium==
Since late 2021, Cyprus have played their home matches at the Georgios Karapatakis AEK Arena in Larnaca.

Home matches had previously been staged at different stadiums all around the country. Until 1974, Cyprus used either the old GSP Stadium in central Nicosia or the GSE Stadium in Famagusta. After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, some matches were played at the Tsirion Stadium in Limassol and the Makario Stadium in Nicosia. In 1999, the building of the New GSP Stadium in Nicosia provided a new home for the national team but in 2008, a change of sponsorship forced home fixtures of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification phase to be played at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca. However, Cyprus returned to the GSP Stadium for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying phase however have not played there since September 2021.

<doc id="722731" wikidata="Q2492991" url="?curid=722731" title="Ohio State Route 821">
<text>State Route 821 (SR 821) is a north–south state highway in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. A state-maintained section of the old US 21, its southern terminus is at SR 60 approximately north of Marietta, and its northern terminus is at I-77 in Byesville, along with the eastern terminus of SR 209. The route is entirely undivided surface road, and is much less direct than the newer I-77 which supplanted it as a through route. As the interstate was being built, the designation of US 21 was moved to the freeway before Ohio wholly decommissioned the now-superfluous U.S. route. SR 821 was designated about two years after US 21 was moved onto I-77 in southeastern Ohio.

==Route description==

Along its path, SR 821 passes through central portions of Washington County and Noble County, and into the southern part of Guernsey County. No segment of the route is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.

==History==
SR 821 was created in 1971. The designation was applied to what was the former routing of US 21 between Marietta and Byesville, prior to the completion of I-77 through the area by 1969. At the time, when the US 21 designation was removed from Ohio in favor of I-77, this stretch of roadway was removed from the state highway system. However, by 1971, it was introduced back into the system, and was given the designation of SR 821, based on its routing along the old path of US 21.

<text>Ruby Tuesday Inc. is an American multinational foodservice retailer that owns, operates, and franchises Ruby Tuesday restaurants. The concept was started in 1972 by Samuel E. (Sandy) Beall III.

The corporation was formed in 1996 as a reincorporation of Morrison Restaurants Inc. It is headquartered in Maryville, Tennessee and has 209 locations worldwide, with some temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Its flagship brand is an American cuisine casual dining restaurant chain with locations throughout the United States aside from the Pacific Coast states. Its greatest density of sites is along the eastern coast of the United States (aside from Boston) as it closed several locations in the Great Basin and Great Plains regions, including Chicago, in recent years. In 2016, Ruby Tuesday sold the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill rights to an undisclosed buyer to refocus on the main Ruby Tuesday brand. The company has closed all locations of Wok Hay and Marlin, and Ray&#x27;s. Additionally, it holds development rights to Truffles Grill.

On June 6, 2012, founder and CEO Sandy Beall announced he would leave the company. In October 2017, it announced that NRD Capital Management would be taking the company private through a $146 million deal in early 2018.

The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 7, 2020, stating it will permanently close 185 restaurants that had been shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the closures, the company would have 236 company-owned and operated locations and an undisclosed number of sites run by ten franchisee groups. Ruby Tuesday emerged from bankruptcy on February 24, 2021, with 209 restaurants, having closed more restaurants than initially planned.

==History==

Ruby Tuesday was born out of a $10,000 endowment Sandy Beall had received from a friend and operator of several Pizza Huts to open his own restaurant. Beall took the name from The Rolling Stones song &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;, after a suggestion by one of several fraternity brothers who were co-investors. With that money, and another $10,000 put together with four of his University of Tennessee fraternity brothers, the first Ruby Tuesday restaurant was opened in 1972. The location was adjacent to the university&#x27;s Knoxville campus, and although the building still stands, the restaurant has since closed. 

Over the next decade, a new location opened about every nine months. In April 1982, Beall sold the expanded 16-unit Ruby Tuesday chain to Morrison Inc. for $15 million in cash and stock. The sale provided the rapidly growing restaurant chain with additional financial support. It also saw Sandy Beall become president of a newly formed Specialty Restaurant Division spearheaded by Ruby Tuesday. By 1985, the chain had grown to operate 35 locations and was a significant contributor to the renewed success of Morrison&#x27;s.

Morrison Inc. was renamed Morrison Restaurants Inc. in 1992 to reflect the importance of its restaurant investments. Additionally, the company realigned its dining division with a new name, the Ruby Tuesday Group. That same year, Beall was named CEO of Morrison Restaurants Inc. On March 9, 1996, the shareholders of Morrison&#x27;s approved distribution and dissolved Morrison Restaurants Inc. into three separate companies: Ruby Tuesday Inc., Morrison Health Care Inc., and Morrison&#x27;s Fresh Cooking Inc.

Ruby Tuesday Inc. became the legal successor to Morrison Restaurants Inc. and was incorporated in Mobile, Alabama. At the time of the distribution, Ruby Tuesday Inc. operated many other restaurant brands in addition to their flagship Ruby Tuesday brand, including L&amp;N Seafood Grill, Mozzarella&#x27;s Café, Silver Spoon Café, and Tia&#x27;s Tex-Mex. In November 2000, Ruby Tuesday Inc. completed the sale of all restaurant brands (except Ruby Tuesday) to Specialty Restaurant Group, LLC. This divestiture allowed Ruby Tuesday to concentrate exclusively on the growth and development of its namesake brand. On April 12, 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. changed its NYSE ticker symbol from RI to RT.

On October 7, 2020, Ruby Tuesday filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection.

===Restaurant themes===

In August 2007, Ruby Tuesday Inc. ventured back into other concepts with their newly acquired Asian dining restaurant, Wok Hay. The company proceeded to convert the concept from self-service to full-service dining. In October 2008, a second location was opened in a former Ruby Tuesday restaurant building. The company&#x27;s 2011 Annual Report noted an additional franchised Wok Hay restaurant in Trinidad, bringing the emerging chain to three operating restaurants.

In September 2010, Ruby Tuesday Inc. continued its venture into other concepts with an agreement to license the Lime Fresh Mexican Grill brand. Earlier the same year, Ruby Tuesday also acquired the development rights to Truffles Grill and introduced their home-grown Marlin &amp; Ray&#x27;s Seafood &amp; Sunsets concept. As of 2011, the company was researching conversion of poorly performing Ruby Tuesday restaurants into some of these concepts. An excerpt from the 2011 Annual Report:

::As of May 31, 2011, we owned and operated one Marlin &amp; Ray’s, one Truffles, and two Wok Hay restaurants. We are currently evaluating the conversion of certain lower performing Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to these concepts. We currently anticipate converting approximately six to eight company-owned Ruby Tuesday concept restaurants to the Marlin &amp; Ray’s, Truffles, or Wok Hay concepts in fiscal 2012. Additionally, we anticipate opening one to two new restaurants and approximately seven to nine smaller, inline Lime restaurants in the fiscal year 2012.

The company has also experimented with the conversion with the Alabama-based Jim &#x27;N Nick&#x27;s Bar-B-Q chain. However, a year after remodeling a Ruby Tuesday restaurant into the company&#x27;s first Jim &#x27;N Nick&#x27;s, company spokeswoman Meridith Hammond indicated they would no longer explore that concept. On April 4, 2012, Ruby Tuesday Inc. announced that it had purchased fast-casual chain Lime Fresh Mexican Grill for $24 million cash. The announcement by Sandy Beall added, &quot;John Kunkel, Lime&#x27;s founder, will be joining our Board of Directors following completion of the acquisition.&quot;

In 2013, after posting a second-quarter loss of $15.1 million, or 24 cents a share, Ruby Tuesday closed 13 Marlin &amp; Ray&#x27;s restaurants and one Wok Hay location, exiting from both concepts. It also sought a buyer for its two licensed Truffles Grill restaurants and closed two company-developed Lime Fresh restaurants.

Ruby Tuesday announced plans that it would be taken private through a purchase by NRD Capital Management, a private-equity firm based in Atlanta, Georgia. The $146 million deal was finalized on December 21, 2017.

==Headquarters==

In the summer of 1998, Ruby Tuesday relocated its main headquarters from Mobile, Alabama to Maryville, Tennessee, just 15 miles south of where the company had been founded. This location contains their Restaurant Support Center and an on-site training facility, called the Center for Leadership Excellence (formerly known as WOW-U). These facilities are used as an internal troubleshooting department, development center, test kitchen, and corporate office for the company&#x27;s executives, restaurant managers, and chefs.

The company purchased a residential property at nearby Maryville College in 1997 to develop a corporate retreat, and renamed it the Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge. Additional guest buildings were added, and the company used the area to dine and house management during corporate training sessions.

==Distribution==

Throughout the first half of the company history, the chain mainly located itself in or near shopping malls. Starting in the early 1990s, the company adjusted its distribution strategy by including more freestanding locations.

As of August 13, 2019, Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchised Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 43 states and 13 foreign countries. The company owned and operated 658 Ruby Tuesday restaurants, while domestic and international franchisees operated 29 and 49 restaurants, respectively. Their international locations include Canada, Chile, Egypt, El Salvador, Guam, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Kuwait, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Panama.

==Marketing==
For much of its history, Ruby Tuesday had little, if any, advertising. By 2002, the company found itself combating traffic and sales losses at many of its locations. This caused the company to change course and introduce coupons at selected sites. By June of the following year, Ruby Tuesday had expanded on this strategy by testing television, radio, and billboard advertising in select locations. The company also began offering a curbside carryout service originally dubbed &quot;TueGo!&quot;

===New identity===

In 2007, the company began a series of significant changes to its brand identity. The changes were made to move the brand&#x27;s customer perception out of the &quot;bar-and-grill&quot; segment of the casual dining industry, and were showcased in the opening of their Times Square location the same year. As part of the changes, Pentagram design studios were hired to help construct a new public visual identity for the brand. The design team created a new logo set in Clarendon, altered the standard color scheme, and created all new packaging to promote the renamed &quot;Ruby TueGo&quot; carryout service. Ruby Tuesday also began remodeling its entire suite of restaurants via the removal of their novelty wall artifacts, faux tiffany lamps, and dated furnishings. The update went on to bring a new menu with higher-quality food and beverages, revamped service techniques, high-definition televisions, and a free guest-accessible Wi-Fi network.

===&quot;Implosion&quot;===
In 2008, Ruby Tuesday marketed an advertising campaign to show how radical their recent changes were. On August 5, over &quot;live&quot; streaming internet video, a demolition crew was supposed to implode the final &quot;old Ruby Tuesday&quot; to cap off the brand&#x27;s commitment of change in front of a small crowd in Mount Holly, Ohio. However, to the crowd&#x27;s shock, the &quot;restaurant&quot; next door (Cheeky&#x27;s Bar and Grill, which looked like a typical casual dining chain) was demolished.

Following the events, the senior VP of marketing for Ruby Tuesday (in actuality, an actor) posted a written apology on the company&#x27;s website and videotaped a formal apology that was broadcast on television. As it turned out, the idea was merely an elaborate marketing ploy to raise attention to the newly remodeled restaurants. The implosion was actually done on a miniature set staffed by a Hollywood special effects crew, and the &quot;live&quot; event had been pre-recorded in Harriman, Tennessee. The two films were then edited together to make it look like an accident.

===Changes continue===
The remodel and its accompanying changes came at an inopportune time for the chain. The Great Recession was underway, and the casual dining segment of the industry was financially suffering. To address these issues, the company debuted made-from-scratch garlic cheese biscuits, a Sunday brunch program, and a steak-and-lobster deal night. Despite all of this, financial analysts have been highly critical of the company&#x27;s actions regarding the ever-changing shift in strategies.

In 2012, yet another advertising campaign was announced to analysts to boost guest perception. It included a reintroduction of television advertising and a continued shift to convert under-performing stores.

In 2014, returning to the more family friendly casual restaurant chain, Ruby Tuesday changed the employees&#x27; uniform to more colorful attire of blue jeans and shirts in a variety of colors, changing the menus to a chalkboard theme, adding more current top 100 hit songs to the internal music system and updating their logo to a more modern font style. Continuing the trend in 2015, the chain updated their dated children&#x27;s menu with the addition of cheese pizza and corn dogs, more colorful plastic beverage cups, and colorful twisty straws.

To promote the more family friendly feel, the chain introduced a Kids Eat Free night on their flagship day, Tuesday. At all company owned restaurants, a child&#x27;s meal is free with the purchase of an adult entree.

In August 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced that it would close 95 restaurants as sales slid.

=== Sponsorships ===

From 2006 until 2009, Alex Job Racing and Ruby Tuesday partnered to form the Ruby Tuesday Championship Racing Team. The team drove the No. 23 Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series.

In 2009, Eddie Sharp Racing announced a long-term partnership agreement with Ruby Tuesday as the sponsor of the No. 2 Toyota, driven by Tim George Jr. in the ARCA Racing Series.

==== NASCAR ====
Starting with the 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series, Ruby Tuesday has had a partnership with Penske Racing to sponsor Brad Keselowski in the No. 22 Dodge Challenger. The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear deck lid of Brad&#x27;s No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.

Prior to the beginning of the 2011 Daytona 500, Ruby Tuesday was added as a last-minute one-race sponsor for Brian Keselowski, older brother of Brad Keselowski.

In 2012, Ruby Tuesday dropped sponsorship on Brad Keselowski&#x27;s car.

==Menu==

Ruby Tuesday offers primarily American cuisine, including all-natural chicken, pasta, pork ribs, soups, steak, and seafood. However, the brand is still commonly recognized for their salad bar and hamburgers, which have been staples to the chain since its creation. All of the restaurants also offer a full bar that serves cocktails, beer, and wine. The wine menu was most recently changed in November 2011 to introduce what the brand is calling &quot;Cultivate Wines&quot;.

A separate menu is available for placing bulk take-out or catering orders. On January 25, 2012, the company announced their partnership with ezCater to help boost the company&#x27;s catering sales.

From 2009 to 2016, Peter Glander, former sous-chef at The Modern restaurant inside the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, was the executive chef for the chain. He was responsible for the addition of the pretzel bun to their menu, along with the removal of the brand&#x27;s long-standing dessert, the chocolate tallcake.

===Dietary concerns===
The company was the first large national casual dining chain in the country to post specific nutritional information on their menus. After initially posting this information for all menu items, they reduced the inclusion to a more subtle item-specific format, called the &quot;Smart-Eating&quot; section (also labeled as &quot;Fit &amp; Trim&quot;). Nutritional and allergen-sensitivity information for the entire menu is available upon request.

Early 2011 saw the company revise and rewrite a portion of their drink recipes to encompass trendy &quot;skinny&quot; cocktails. This shift included changing drink recipes to incorporate healthier liquor and mixer alternatives and labeling the new creations with their &quot;under 150 calories&quot; tagline. VeeV Açaí Spirit, Absolut Berri Açaí Vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and Minute Maid Light Lemonade are the key products used in these drinks.

===Cookbook===
Ruby Tuesday released a cookbook by Jeff Morgan on October 25, 2011, titled &quot;Simply Fresh: Casual Dining at Home&quot;. It contains recipes that have been inspired by the menu, and even recipes that are signature to the brand.

==Restatement of financials==
On April 11, 2005, the company and its audit committee determined the company would restate previously issued historical financial statements to properly account for leases.

<text>State Route 120 (SR 120) is an east–west state highway in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. Its western terminus is at the Michigan state line, where an unnumbered county highway (Morenci Road, formerly M-120) continues west-northwest. State Route 120’s eastern terminus is in Toledo at State Route 65; the route is, for all practical purposes, a spur of U.S. Route 20, which generally bypasses Toledo to the west and south.

==History==
In 1940, Route 120’s original route was certified. It began at the Michigan state line, connecting with the former M-120 near Metamora. SR-120’s current alignment from the state line to Metamora is original to the route. East of Metamora, SR-120 used Sylvania-Metamora Road, Erie Street and Monroe Street to enter Sylvania. The route then turned south on Main Street and Holland-Sylvania Road to leave Sylvania. SR-120 then continued south to U.S. Route 20 (Central Avenue) near Ottawa Hills. SR-120 was co-signed with US-20 from Holland-Sylvania to Reynolds Road, where US-20 turned south. Route 120 continued east from Reynolds Road along Central Avenue. Its alignment along Central Avenue to Cherry Street in Toledo has been unchanged since its inception. At Cherry Street, the route turned south, traveling through Downtown Toledo and over the Maumee River. SR-120 then used Main Street, Starr Avenue and East Broadway to make its way to current State Route 51 (Woodville Road). Route 120 then traveled along Woodville Road from Toledo to its eastern terminus east of Elmore. The section from Sylvania to Toledo replaced State Route 263 and the section from Toledo to east of Elmore replaced State Route 102
In 1946, the route east of Metamora was decertified by the state. The section west of Toledo was renumbered State Route 102, which turned south in Metamora along current State Route 64 to the village of Assumption, then joined US-20 and ran east into Toledo. The section from Sylvania to near Ottawa Hills (Main Street/Holland-Sylvania Road) was designated as State Route 333 (now defunct).

By 1950, the route extended west to the Michigan border, replacing State Route 102.

The coming of the expressway system in Toledo brought changes to State Route 120 as well. In 1955, the route was added to a stretch of the future Detroit-Toledo Expressway in Northwood. The former routing from Northwood to Elmore certified as State Route 51. 
 SR-120 then went south along the expressway to its new eastern terminus at US-20 near Lemoyne. In 1959, more of the Detroit-Toledo Expressway was completed and SR-120 was added to a longer stretch of the expressway, now designated as Interstate 280. From Cherry Street in Downtown Toledo, the route turned east onto Summit Street (today’s State Route 65). At the expressway, SR-120 joined I-280, using it to its terminus near Lemoyne. By 1962, SR-120 was removed from Cherry Street and Summit Street and extended east along Central Avenue to its interchange with I-280. 

In 1970, the Route 120 designation was completely removed from I-280. SR-120 was truncated back to the Central Avenue exit (then exit 11) of I-280. The former Summit Street routing of SR-120 was added to US-223 and the old stretch of SR-120 from the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) south to US-20 was re-designated as State Route 420. 

The last change to the route occurred in 1989. Route 120 was moved back onto Cherry Street into Downtown Toledo, ending at its present terminus at Summit Street (SR-65). The alignment to Interstate 280 was decertified after the Central Avenue interchange with I-280 removed.
===Before 1940===
*1923–1939 – Routed along the current alignment of State Route 185 from U.S. Route 127 northwest of Versailles to Piqua; this route certified as State Route 185 in 1940.

<doc id="722767" wikidata="Q409770" url="?curid=722767" title="Gonadotropin">
<text>Gonadotropins are glycoprotein hormones secreted by gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary of vertebrates. This family includes the mammalian hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the placental/chorionic gonadotropins, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), as well as at least two forms of fish gonadotropins. These hormones are central to the complex endocrine system that regulates normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function. LH and FSH are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, while hCG and eCG are secreted by the placenta in pregnant women and mares, respectively. The gonadotropins act on the gonads, controlling gamete and sex hormone production.

Gonadotropin is sometimes abbreviated &quot;Gn&quot;. The alternative spelling &quot;gonadotrophin&quot; which inaccurately implies a nourishing mechanism is also used.

There are various preparations of gonadotropins for therapeutic use, mainly as fertility medication. There are also fad diet or quack preparations, which are illegal in various countries.

==Natural types and subunit structure==
The two principal gonadotropins in vertebrates are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), although primates produce a third gonadotropin called chorionic gonadotropin (CG). LH and FSH are heterodimers consisting of two peptide chains, an alpha chain and a beta chain. LH and FSH share nearly identical alpha chains (about 100 amino acids long), whereas the beta chain provides specificity for receptor interactions. These subunits are heavily modified by glycosylation.

The alpha subunit is common to each protein dimer (well conserved within species, but differing between them), and a unique beta subunit confers biological specificity. The alpha chains are highly conserved proteins of about 100 amino acid residues which contain ten conserved cysteines all involved in disulfide bonds, as shown in the following schematic representation.
 +----------+| +-------------|--+
 
 +------|-----------------+ |
 +----------------------------+

&#x27;C&#x27;: conserved cysteine involved in a disulphide bond.

Intracellular levels of free alpha subunits are greater than those of the mature glycoprotein, implying that hormone assembly is limited by the appearance of the specific beta subunits, and hence that synthesis of alpha and beta is independently regulated.

Another human gonadotropin is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), produced by the placenta during pregnancy.

==Mechanism==

Gonadotropin receptors are embedded in the surface of the target cell membranes and coupled to the G-protein system. Signals triggered by binding to the receptor are relayed within the cells by the cyclic AMP second messenger system.

Gonadotropins are released under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus. The gonads — testes and ovaries — are the primary target organs for LH and FSH. The gonadotropins affect multiple cell types and elicit multiple responses from the target organs. As a simplified generalization, LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes and the theca cells of the ovaries to produce testosterone (and indirectly estradiol), whereas FSH stimulates the spermatogenic tissue of the testes and the granulosa cells of ovarian follicles, as well as stimulating production of estrogen by the ovaries.

Although gonadotropins are secreted in a pulsatile manner (as a result of pulsatile GnRH release), unlike the case of GnRH and GnRH agonists, constant/non-pulsatile activation of the gonadotropin receptors by the gonadotropins does not produce functional inhibition. This can be seen during the first 7–10 weeks of pregnancy, where constantly high and progressively-increasing levels of hCG circulate and mediate production of estrogen and progesterone by the corpus luteum until the placenta takes over the production of these hormones.

==Diseases==
Gonadotropin deficiency due to pituitary disease results in hypogonadism, which can lead to infertility. Treatment includes administered gonadotropins, which, therefore, work as fertility medication. Such can either be produced by extraction and purification from urine or be produced by recombinant DNA.

Failure or loss of the gonads usually results in elevated levels of LH and FSH in the blood.

LH insensitivity, which results in Leydig cell hypoplasia in males, and FSH insensitivity, are conditions of insensitivity to LH and FSH, respectively, caused by loss-of-function mutations in their respective signaling receptors. Another closely related condition to these is GnRH insensitivity.

==Pharmaceutical preparations==
There are various preparations of gonadotropins for therapeutic use, mainly as fertility medication. For example, the so-called menotropins (also called &quot;human menopausal gonadotropins&quot;) consist of LH and FSH extracted from the urine of menopausal women. There are also recombinant variants. Besides the aforementioned legitimate pharmaceutical drugs, there are fad diet or quack preparations, which are illegal in various countries.

<doc id="722773" wikidata="Q157419" url="?curid=722773" title="Phalaris arundinacea">
<text>Phalaris arundinacea, or reed canary grass, is a tall, perennial bunchgrass that commonly forms extensive single-species stands along the margins of lakes and streams and in wet open areas, with a wide distribution in Europe, Asia, northern Africa and North America. Other common names for the plant include gardener&#x27;s-garters and ribbon grass in English, alpiste roseau in French, Rohrglanzgras in German, kusa-yoshi in Japanese, caniço-malhado in Portuguese, and hierba cinta and pasto cinto in Spanish.

==Description==
The stems can reach in height. The leaf blades are usually green, but may be variegated. The panicles are up to long. The spikelets are light green, often streaked with darker green or purple. This is a perennial grass which spreads underground by its thick rhizomes.

==Uses==
A number of cultivars of &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; have been selected for use as ornamental plants, including variegated (striped) cultivars – sometimes called ribbon grass – such as &#x27;Castor&#x27; and &#x27;Feesey&#x27;. The latter has a pink tinge to the leaves. When grown, although drought-tolerant, it likes abundant water and can even be grown as an aquatic plant.

Reed canary grass grows well on poor soil and contaminated industrial sites, and researchers at Teesside University&#x27;s Contaminated Land &amp; Water Centre have suggested it as the ideal candidate for phytoremediation in improving soil quality and biodiversity at brownfield sites.

The grass can also easily be turned into bricks or pellets for burning in biomass power stations. Furthermore, it provides fibers which find use in pulp and papermaking processes.

&quot;P. arundinacea&quot; is also planted as a hay crop or for forage.

This species of &quot;Phalaris&quot; may also be used as a source for the psychedelic drugs DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and 5-OH-DMT (bufotenin), as well as Hordenine and 5-MeO-NMT; however, N,N-DMT is considered most desirable. Although the concentrations of these compounds is lower than in other potential sources, such as &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot; and &quot;Mimosa tenuiflora&quot;, large enough quantities of the grass can be refined to make an ad hoc ayahuasca brew.

==Ecology==
In many places, &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; is an invasive species in wetlands, particularly in disturbed areas. It has been reported as an invasive weed in floodplains, riverside meadows, and other wetland habitat types around the world. When &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; invades a wetland, it inhibits native vegetation and reduces biological diversity. It alters the entire ecosystem. The grass propagates by seed and rhizome, and once established, is difficult to eradicate.

==Distribution==
&quot;P. arundinacea&quot; now has worldwide distribution. It is regarded as native to both North America and Eurasia, but this is debated and it appears that the populations in North America are made up of a mixture of cultivars of both those that were introduced from Europe and indigenous varieties.

==Chemical properties==
Specimens contain varying levels of hordenine and gramine.

Leaves of &quot;P. arundinacea&quot; contain DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and related compounds. Levels of beta-carbolines and hordenine have also been reported.

<doc id="722779" wikidata="Q2600413" url="?curid=722779" title="List of WWE Intercontinental Champions">
<text>The WWE Intercontinental Championship is a professional wrestling championship contested in and owned by the American promotion WWE on the Raw brand. The title was introduced into the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1979. Pat Patterson, holder of the WWF North American Heavyweight Championship, was awarded the title (with the kayfabe explanation that he won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and unified the North American and South American titles).

The Intercontinental Championship has been called the second most important championship in the company, after the WWE Championship. It has been active in WWE for the second-longest period, but is the third-oldest active title overall, behind the WWE Championship (1963) and the United States Championship (1975), the latter of which was acquired from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001. In 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and the championship was renamed accordingly. Following the 2023 WWE Draft, the title is currently exclusive to Raw.

Overall, there have been 187 reigns among 91 different champions. Chris Jericho holds the record for the most reigns with nine. The current champion is Bron Breakker, who is in his second reign. He won the title by defeating Jey Uso on the October 21, 2024 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="722782" wikidata="Q1162712" url="?curid=722782" title="Ohio State Route 2">
<text>State Route 2 (SR 2), formerly known as Inter-county Highway 2 until 1921 and State Highway 2 in 1922, is an east–west highway crossing most of northern Ohio. Its western terminus is at the Indiana state line near Hicksville where the route becomes Indiana State Road 37 which continues to Fort Wayne, Indiana. The eastern terminus of the route is in Painesville Township in Lake County at U.S. Route 20 (US 20).

==Route description==
It passes through Bryan, Wauseon (where it briefly becomes a couplet), and enters greater Toledo west of its interchange with the Ohio Turnpike. It continues east from greater Toledo and soon parallels Lake Erie, becoming a freeway near Port Clinton. From Oregon to Sandusky SR 2 is part of of the highway designated the &quot;Lake Erie Coastal Ohio Trail&quot;. and on September 22, 2005, was designated a National Scenic Byway. From Toledo to Sandusky the highway is also part of and designated the Lake Erie Circle Tour that is also part of the &quot;Great Lakes Circle Tour&quot;. It then passes Sandusky, where it meets U.S. Route 250 (US 250) and US 6, and separates from the lakeshore as a freeway, and traverses rural Erie County before entering Lorain County. Near Elyria, it joins Interstate 90 (I-90), whose route it shares to Rocky River, where it follows SR 254 along Detroit Road into Lakewood. Here it again joins US 6, as well as US 20 on Clifton Boulevard. It then becomes part of the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway in Cleveland, joining I-90 again near Burke Lakefront Airport. These two highways split near Euclid, and SR 2 continues along the Lakeland Freeway to Painesville, feeding into US 20 eastbound. SR 2 serves as an access route to lakeshore attractions on Lake Erie from Toledo and Cleveland and as an alternative to the Ohio Turnpike.

The stretch of SR 2 from Toledo to Sandusky passes several attractions. The Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge is just east of SR 19 in Carroll Township. It sits on along with the Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station.

SR 2 is the lowest numbered state route in Ohio. SR 1 was decommissioned in 1965.

===Naming===
The section of SR 2 that runs through Erie County is called the &quot;Jackie Mayer Miss America Highway&quot; and is named for Jackie Mayer, a former Miss America who was born and raised in Sandusky.

The section of SR 2 that runs through Willoughby is named &quot;Brian Montgomery Memorial Highway&quot; in honor of a Marine Lance Corporal who was killed in the Iraq War in August 2005.

==History==

*1912: Intercounty Highway 2 runs from Cleveland to the Pennsylvania state line.
*1923: Route is extended to follow current US 6 alignment from the Indiana state line to Bryan, and current SR 51 and US 20 from Toledo to the Pennsylvania state line.
*1926–1927: Rerouted from Toledo to Cleveland along previous SR 23 alignment from Toledo to Port Clinton, previously unnumbered route from Port Clinton to west of Sandusky, and previous SR 12 from west of Sandusky to Cleveland. Cleveland-to-Pennsylvania alignment certified as US 20.
*1931: Extended east to Willoughby along previously unnumbered route (St. Clair).
*1931–1932: Western terminus shortened to Bryan, Bryan to Indiana state line certified as US 6
*1936: Extended to Indiana state line via the former SR 108 alignment from Hicksville to Bryan, and the former SR 18 alignment from the Indiana state line to Hicksville, with which it was dually certified along this route until 1940.
*1939: SR 18 alignment removed from SR 2 alignment west of Hicksville.

=== SR 2 Temporary ===

*State Route 2 temporary was a designation that ran from West 6th to East 9th along Lakeside Avenue in downtown Cleveland. The designation was added when the final alignments of SR 2 were moved to the then new Lakeside Highway, later referred to as the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway. The route&#x27;s eastern terminus was moved to Public Square via Ontario St. in 1957.
===SR 2C===

*State Route 2C is an unsigned connecting road that runs from State Route 163 to State Route 2 and State Route 53 near Port Clinton in Ottawa County, Ohio. State Route 2C was constructed as an access road for the SR 2–SR 163 interchange.
===SR 2D===

*State Route 2D is part of a couplet in Wauseon, Ohio that is signed as State Route 2. SR 2D is signed as SR 2 westbound, while SR 2D is signed as SR 2 eastbound, (except west of East Elm Street, where SR 2D meets SR 2 at its western terminus). The route ends at the corner of East Linfoot Street and North Shoop Avenue.
