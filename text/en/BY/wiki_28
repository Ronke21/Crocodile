<text>Annie Montague Alexander (29 December 1867 – 10 September 1950) was an explorer, naturalist, paleontological collector, and philanthropist.

She founded the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ). From its establishment in 1908 until she died in 1950 she financed the museum&#x27;s collections and supported a series of paleontological expeditions throughout the western United States. Alexander herself took part in many of these expeditions, accumulating a significant collection of fossils and exotic game animals that she would later donate to the museum. Alexander is remembered by the University of California, Berkeley as one of the &quot;builders of Berkeley&quot; and as the benefactress of the museum.

==Early life==
Annie Montague Alexander was born December 29, 1867, in Honolulu during the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was the granddaughter of New England missionaries in Maui. Her father Samuel Thomas Alexander and her uncle Henry Perrine Baldwin were founders of Alexander &amp; Baldwin. Her mother Martha Cooke was the daughter of Amos Starr Cooke, the founder of Castle &amp; Cooke. These were two of the &quot;Big Five&quot; corporations that started as sugar cane plantation owners and then dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii.

Annie Montague was the second of five children. Her youngest brother, Clarence Chambers, was born in 1880 but died in 1884. Her cousins included Henry Alexander Baldwin and Clarence Hyde Cooke who carried on the family businesses.

She attended Punahou School for one year, but when her family moved to Oakland, California, in 1882 to get medical attention for her grandfather, she enrolled in Oakland High School. In 1886 she attended Lasell Seminary for Young Women in Auburndale, Massachusetts.

In 1888, she traveled with her family to Paris and studied painting, but the detailed work caused vision problems and persistent headaches. She returned to Oakland and trained briefly as a nurse. She soon left the program when she found that studying the required medical textbooks brought on another bout of headaches and vision problems.

Her father left the business to others and took Annie, her sister Martha, and a cousin on a 1,500-mile bicycle trip through Europe in 1893. In 1896 Alexander and her uncle explored the South Pacific stopping in Hong Kong, China, and Singapore. On that same trip, they also explored Java, Samoa, and New Zealand.

In 1899 she went camping in Oregon with her friend Martha Beckwith and then went with her father to Bermuda. Alexander&#x27;s passion for paleontology was sparked on her trip to Crater Lake with Beckwith and in 1900 she began auditing paleontology lectures at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, Alexander met Professor John C. Merriam. As their friendship developed she offered to underwrite the entire cost of his upcoming expeditions. She later participated in Merriam&#x27;s 1901 expedition to Fossil Lake in Oregon, as well as his 1902 and 1903 expeditions to Shasta County in Northern California.

== Early expeditions, 1901–1910 ==

=== Fossil Lake, 1901 ===
In February 1901 John C. Merriam and Alexander began organizing an expedition. They were unable to decide on a location until Merriam proposed a trip to Shasta County where they could collect Triassic vertebrate fossils to which Alexander agreed. Three weeks before departure, Merriam convinced Alexander to instead go to Fossil Lake in south-central Oregon. This dry and arid region had been explored previously beginning in the 1870s and would prove a fruitful location for Alexander. Alexander was attended by Herbert Furlong and William Greeley, two of Merriam&#x27;s students who were chosen to provide assistance and expertise for her. They planned their route from Northern California up to Fossil Lake and then headed West to Crater Lake before heading back to California. Other participants included Ernest, an African American wagon driver and cook, and a young boy named Willis. Alexander also invited her friend Mary Wilson. The trip lasted from May 30 to August 13 and they returned with nearly 300 pounds in fossils.

=== Shasta County, 1901–1903 ===

==== 1901 ====
This expedition was organized by John C. Merriam and financed by Alexander though she did not attend because she was currently on an expedition to Fossil Lake. Shasta County had captured attention from California Paleontologists in 1893 after James Perrin Smith (of Stanford) searched for ammonites. Though he did find ammonites, he also returned with the first Mesozoic marine vertebrate found in California he named &quot;Nothosaurus.&quot; In 1895, Smith sent his findings to Merriam and sparked what became Merriam&#x27;s intense focus on Shasta County.

==== 1902 ====
From June 16 to July 13, Alexander and her team explored along a limestone ridge in Shasta County.

Participants included Vance Osmont, an assistant and student of John C. Merriam, Eustace Furlong, Waldemar Schaller, and Katherine Jones. Jones was in charge of keeping an account of the trip. Alexander&#x27;s role in the expedition included funding, collecting and, excavating, as well as cooking for the team. The trip was brief but they returned with three significant fossils including &quot;Shastasaurus alexandre&quot; named in honor of Alexander.

==== 1903 ====

Little is known about this trip beyond its participants and some of its findings. Along with Alexander, the participants were Edna Wemple, Eustace Furlong, Frederick Sylvanus Ray, and Ward Benjamin Esterly. On this trip, Alexander uncovered her first significant fossil that was new to the scientific world which John C. Merriam named in her honor &quot;Thalattosaurus alexandrae.&quot;

=== Africa, 1904 ===
In 1904, Alexander left on a trip with her father and Thomas L. Gulick, son of missionary Peter Johnson Gulick and younger brother of John Thomas Gulick who was an early developer of theories of evolution. The men were looking forward to hunting big game in Africa, while Annie was collecting fossils and taking pictures. Gulick became ill and died on August 15, 1904, in Kijabe, Kenya. On September 8, the Alexanders reached Victoria Falls. The next day they crossed the Zambezi river and climbed down the canyon for a better view. While she was preparing to take a picture, Samuel was hit by a boulder tossed down from workers above that crushed his foot. Her father died a day later on September 10 after receiving an emergency amputation.

The death of her father had a profound effect on shaping her career as a naturalist. In personal letters after his death, Alexander expressed a need to find a distraction that would prevent her from thinking about the loss of her father. It was then that she decided to dedicate her life to preserving the wild flora and fauna of California and the West Coast.

=== Saurian Expedition, Nevada, 1905 ===

In 1905, she financed and took part in the Saurian Expedition to the West Humboldt Range in Nevada. The expedition discovered many of the finest specimens of ichthyosaur. In 1905, Alexander financed and attended another expedition alongside John C. Merriam and his assistant Eustace L. Furlong. They headed 300 miles west to the West Humboldt Mountain Range located in northwestern Nevada. The expedition lasted only a few months but they returned with many of the finest specimens of ichthyosaur found at that time. During many of her expeditions, Alexander kept a scrapbook containing photos of landscapes, participants, and fossil finds. In her scrapbook from the Saurian Expedition, Annie included photos of herself and Edna Wemple documenting their work in the field.

=== Alaska, 1906–07 ===

Alexander met C. Hart Merriam (cousin of John C. Merriam) in 1904. At the time, Merriam was the chief of the United States Biological Survey and he became interested in Alexander&#x27;s fossil collection. In one meeting, he recalled stories of Alaska which inspired Alexander to explore again. In the spring of 1906, Alexander and her team left for the Kenai Peninsula. Participants included Edna Wemple and Alvin Seale. The expedition began in southeastern Alaska at Malaspina Glacier and ended at Skilak Lake.

From April to August 1907, Alexander financed and led another trip to Alaska; the expedition to southeastern Alaska included Alexander, Joseph S. Dixon, Chase Littlejohn, Frank Stephens and, Kate Stephens.

=== Vancouver Island, 1910 ===
In 1910, Alexander embarked on a trip north to British Columbia with Louise Kellogg to expand upon the research they had done in Alaska. While there, Alexander enlisted the help of a local trapper named Edward Despard who was tasked with finding mink, marten, raccoons, otters, and beavers. While Despard hunted on his own, Alexander and Kellogg remained together looking for smaller mammals and birds. Together Alexander and Kellogg found 75 song sparrows. The women returned to California with 137 specimens including a cougar, many minks, and a large black bear that Alexander purchased from a farmer.

== The University of California Museum of Paleontology ==

After numerous expeditions in Alaska, Alexander had amassed a large collection of both flora and fauna. Moved by the notion that she needed to preserve the wildlife that she saw as rapidly disappearing from the western United States, Alexander proposed and financed a new museum in California. The goal of the museum was to provide paleontological material to researchers on campus to further their studies as well as preserve the declining environment around them for posterity as well as cultivating an interest in natural history.

In 1907, Alexander met Joseph Grinnell, a young scientist from Stanford who had already begun to make a name for himself in the field of zoology. Upon meeting Alexander he expressed his wish that the West Coast had a museum of natural history. Grinnell proposed a museum at Stanford but Alexander stood her ground and she pushed for a museum at the University of California, Berkeley where her passion for paleontology had flourished. Grinnell proposed the name Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and he was named by Alexander as the permanent choice of director. Grinnell held this position until he died in 1939.

While waiting for the museum to open, Alexander embarked on more trips to Alaska with her new companion Louise Kellogg.

In 1909, the museum opened and needed fossils. Merriam, Furlong, Kellogg, and Alexander headed back to Humboldt County, Nevada, in search of fossils. They found wooly rhinoceroses, camels, mastodons, other mammals, lizards, and birds. Throughout their lifetimes, Alexander and Kellogg collected nearly 7,000 specimens of birds, mammals, and amphibians for the museum. They also collected over 17,000 plants for the University Herbarium and contributed thousands of fossils for the UCMP. Alexander remained, until the end of her life, the largest donor and benefactress of the museum helping to fund and fill the museum with everything she found.

In 1920, when Merriam left the University to become president of the Carnegie Institution, the paleontology department was merged with the geology department, displeasing both Merriam and Alexander. Merriam&#x27;s departure from the museum angered Alexander but her dedication to the museum remained unwavering. She subsequently helped establish the UCMP and created an endowment for its funding. After Merriam&#x27;s defection, Alexander continued to give money to the university but grew frustrated with the Regents that Merriam was allowed to exert control over her donations. She also helped finance much of the work of William Diller Matthew and his protégé George Gaylord Simpson.

== Later life ==

Alexander shared her life with Kellogg for forty-two years. By all accounts, it was a devoted &quot;Boston marriage.&quot; Among other activities, the two ran a working farm together; they raised cattle but eventually switched to asparagus which was a seasonal crop so it left them more time throughout the year to travel. During the summer, they could go on fossil trips and then spend their winters in Hawaii. Both Alexander and Kellogg were dedicated to their findings and on a trip to Hawaii in 1920 they found over 100 species of shells for the Paleontology Department. Alexander continued to finance expeditions and perform fieldwork throughout her life, celebrating her 80th birthday while in the Sierra de la Laguna mountains.

In 1949, before planned her winter trip to Hawaii, Alexander had a stroke and remained in a coma until she died on September 10, 1950, just before her 83rd birthday. Alexander&#x27;s ashes were returned to Hawaii and were buried at the Makawao Cemetery, Maui near her childhood home.

By the time of her death, Alexander had explored and collected in Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii, Vancouver Island, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico.

== Benefaction and investments ==

Throughout her affiliation with U.C. Berkeley, Alexander wished to remain anonymous asking for her donations to be marked as given by &quot;a friend of the university&quot; rather than by name. For Alexander, the hard work and the science were far more important to her than the fame of being its benefactress. She is remembered today as helping to &#x27;build Berkeley&#x27; as well as being the benefactress of many of their most well-known paleontologists.

For more than fifty years, Alexander continued to believe in the work that public education could do. Alexander was an heiress who experienced vastly more freedom than many women of her time and she used her money to expand public education in the hopes that all could appreciate California&#x27;s wildlife for generations. As a woman with money, Alexander also had an interest in stocks and finances. Alexander once invited a wealthy friend who had encouraged her to invest her fortune in exchange for larger returns to the museum. Alexander gave her friend a tour of the museum and gestured to a group of working students and said &quot;Here are my investments.&quot;

Alexander maintained control of the museum until she died in 1950. She wanted to fill the museum with scientists who had &quot;their accomplishments ahead of, rather than behind them.&quot; She insisted on this because she believed that this museum could become a place of great authority on the west coast that would enable the careers of many paleontologists. By the time of her death, Alexander, with great help from Kellogg, donated 20,564 specimens to the University of California Museum of Paleontology.

Not only did Alexander establish, finance, and provide specimens for two museums she also helped to bring natural history and its leading scientists into the spotlight. Alexander hired, funded, and collected specimens for men who are recognized as giants of vertebrate zoology and paleontology such as Joseph Grinnell, Alden H. Miller, E. Raymond Hall, John C. Merriam, and Charles L. Camp. Her benefaction and dedication to natural history provided these men the resources they needed and indirectly provided the world with the research they created.

Annie Alexander&#x27;s philanthropy and contributions to science and the University of California Berkeley were honored by naming one of the falcons nesting on Sather Tower after her.

Through an anonymous donation, Alexander also established in 1920 the Folklore Foundation at Vassar College. The chair created as part of the foundation, was the first chair in folklore at any college or university in the United States. It was held by Martha Beckwith and ended on her retirement in 1938.

<text>In computing, DirectInput is a legacy Microsoft API for collecting input from a computer user, via input devices such as the mouse, keyboard, or a gamepad. It also provides a system for &quot;action mapping,&quot; which allows the user to assign specific actions within a game to the buttons and axes of the input devices. Additionally it handles &quot;haptic feedback&quot; (input/output) devices. Microsoft introduced a new input library called XInput specifically for the Xbox 360 controller.

DirectInput and XInput provide benefits over normal Win32 input events:

* they enable an application to retrieve data from input devices even when the application is in the background
* they provide full support for any type of input device, as well as for &quot;haptic feedback&quot;
* through &quot;action mapping&quot;, applications can retrieve input data without needing to know what kind of device generated that input

While DirectInput forms a part of the DirectX library, it has not been significantly revised since DirectX 8 (2001–2002). Microsoft recommends that new applications make use of the Windows message loop for keyboard and mouse input instead of DirectInput (as indicated in the Meltdown 2005 slideshow), and to use GameInput instead of DirectInput and other legacy APIs, such as XInput, for controllers.

== History ==
DirectX included DirectInput from version 1.0 (1995). It initially offered true support only for joysticks, as the mouse and keyboard modules simply provided wrappers to the standard Win32 API. DirectX version 3.0 (1996) added support for keyboards and mice; it also improved joystick support. DirectX 5.0 (1997) included greatly improved joystick support, including adding haptic feedback, increasing the number of buttons, changing the underlying device-driver model and incorporating a COM-based API. Mouse support also increased the number of buttons seen from four to eight. In DirectX 7.0 (1999- ), DirectInput added a long-promised feature of seeing individual mice much like individual joysticks, but the feature didn&#x27;t work with the later released Windows XP, even though it works with Windows 98/Me and DirectX 9. DirectX 8.0 (2000), the last version with major changes, included action mapping and broader support for different types of devices.

While Microsoft initially intended that DirectInput would handle all inputs, this didn&#x27;t work out. Microsoft no longer recommends using DirectInput for keyboards or mice, and has started pushing the newer XInput for Xbox 360 controllers. In Windows Vista, Windows 7 and later Windows versions, the in-built action mapping UI has been removed. DirectInput is not available for Windows Store apps.

== XInput ==

XInput, a legacy API for &quot;next generation&quot; controllers, was introduced in December 2005 alongside the launch of the Xbox 360. This specification provided support for Xbox 360 controllers in Windows XP SP1 and subsequent operating systems, and is described by Microsoft as being easier to program for and requiring less setup than DirectInput. XInput is compatible with DirectX version 9 and later.

==Xbox 360 Controller support==

An &quot;Xbox 360 Controller&quot;, with the default Microsoft driver, has the following limitations with DirectInput, compared to XInput:

* the left and right triggers will act as a single axis representing the signed difference between the triggers, not as independent analog axis
* vibration effects will not operate
* querying for headset devices will not operate, XInput 1.4 as part of Windows 8 introduced Xbox headset support.

According to MSDN, &quot;the combination of the left and right triggers in DirectInput is by design. Games have always assumed that DirectInput device axes are centered when there is no user interaction with the device. However, the Xbox 360 controller was designed to register minimum value, not center, when the triggers are not being held.&quot; MSDN proffered the &quot;solution&quot; of combining the triggers, setting one trigger to a positive direction and the other to a negative direction, so no user interaction is indicative to DirectInput of the &quot;control&quot; being at center.

The above, however, ignores the fact that many DirectInput controllers, such as gamepads with dual analog sticks and racing-wheel controller sets, already map triggers and pedals independently. In addition, many DirectInput devices also have vibration effects. At least one 3rd-party driver, XBCD, gives the Xbox 360 controllers the vibration support, dead zones and (optionally) independent analog/digital triggers through DirectInput its XInput driver possesses. This suggests that Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 controller driver was given &quot;intentionally&quot; weaker DirectInput support, rather than due to any differences between DirectInput and XInput APIs. On the other hand, Xbox 360 controllers using XInput support only very basic control of vibration motors in contrast with greater palette of effects supported via DirectInput.

<text>DirectSound is a deprecated software component of the Microsoft DirectX library for the Windows operating system, superseded by XAudio2. It provides a low-latency interface to sound card drivers written for Windows 95 through Windows XP and can handle the mixing and recording of multiple audio streams. DirectSound was originally written for Microsoft by John Miles.

Besides providing the essential service of passing audio data to the sound card, DirectSound provides other essential capabilities such as recording and mixing sound, adding effects to sound (e.g., reverb, echo, or flange), using hardware accelerated buffers (if the sound card supports hardware audio acceleration) in Windows 95 through XP, and positioning sounds in 3D space. DirectSound also provides a means to capture sounds from a microphone or other input and controlling capture effects during audio capture.

After many years of development, today DirectSound is a mature API, and supplies many other useful capabilities, such as the ability to play multichannel sounds at high resolution. While DirectSound was designed to be used by video games, today it is used to play audio in many audio applications. DirectShow uses DirectSound&#x27;s hardware audio acceleration capabilities if the sound card&#x27;s hardware audio acceleration capabilities exist and are exposed by the audio driver.

==Features==
DirectSound is a user mode API that provides an interface between applications and the sound card driver, enabling applications to produce sounds and play back music.

DirectSound was considered revolutionary when it was introduced in 1995, as it featured multiple simultaneous audio streams and allowed several applications to access the sound card simultaneously. Before that, the game developers were required to implement their own audio rendering engine in software.

DirectSound provides sample rate conversion and sound mixing (volume and pan) for an unlimited number of audio sources; however, the practical limits are the number of hardware audio sources and the performance of software mixers.

The DirectSound architecture features a concept of the &quot;ring buffer&quot; which would be continuously played in a cycle. The application programmer creates the sound buffer then continuously queries its state through the &quot;read cursor&quot; and updates it with the &quot;write cursor&quot;. There are two types of buffers - a &quot;streaming&quot; buffer, which holds continuous sounds such as background music, and a &quot;static&quot; buffer which holds short sounds.

On supported sound cards, DirectSound would try to use &quot;hardware accelerated&quot; buffers, i.e. the ones which either can be placed in local sound card memory, or can be accessed by the sound card from the system memory. If hardware acceleration is not available, DirectSound would create audio buffers in the system memory and use purely software mixing.

Some late DOS-era &quot;wavetable&quot; sound cards such as Sound Blaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound featured dedicated DSPs, which were borrowed from the digital music instruments. These cards featured local memory which could be used for buffering multiple audio streams and mixing them on board, thus offloading the CPU and greatly improving the sound quality. However, this was only possible in DOS by directly programming the hardware, and full-featured &quot;hardware acceleration&quot; from the local memory was never implemented on these cards, due to complexities of double buffering. Later cards such as Sound Blaster Live!, Audigy and X-Fi are capable of accessing the system memory buffers directly.

==DirectSound3D==

DirectSound3D (DS3D) is an extension to DirectSound introduced with DirectX 3 in 1996 with the intention to standardize 3D audio in Windows. DirectSound3D allows software developers to utilize audio by writing once for a single audio API instead of rewriting code numerous times to work for each audio card vendor.

In DirectX 5, DirectSound3D gained the support for sound cards that use third party 3D audio algorithms in order to accelerate DirectSound3D properly, through methods approved by Microsoft.

In DirectX 8, DirectSound and DirectSound3D (DS3D) were officially merged and given the name DirectX Audio, however the API is still commonly referred to as DirectSound.

==EAX==

EAX is an extension to DirectSound and DirectSound3D which provides sound effects processing to the hardware-accelerated buffers.

==OS Support==

===Windows 95/98===
In Windows 95, 98 and Me, the DirectSound mixer component and the sound card drivers were both implemented as a kernel-mode VxD driver (Dsound.vxd), allowing direct access to the primary buffer used by the audio hardware and thus, providing the lowest possible latency between the user-mode API and the underlying hardware, but in some cases causing instability and blue screen errors.

Windows 98 introduced WDM Audio and the &quot;Kernel Audio Mixer&quot; driver (KMixer), which enabled digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams with a higher quality sample rate conversion as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware buffering, DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed. On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM audio drivers were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved.

Although Windows Driver Model (WDM) was available starting with Windows 98, few audio card manufacturers used it in the first release of Windows 98. Due to internal buffering, KMixer introduced significant processing latency (30 ms on then-current systems). Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address these real time multimedia data stream processing requirements. When the sound card uses a custom driver for use with the system supplied port class driver &quot;PortCls.sys&quot; or implements a mini-driver for use with the streaming class driver, applications can bypass the KMixer completely and use the kernel streaming interfaces instead to reduce latency.

===Windows 2000/XP===
In Windows 2000, Microsoft also implemented the same WDM-based audio stack on Windows NT by introducing the WDM audio drivers and the kernel mixer component (KMixer). In Windows XP, Microsoft introduced another improved kernel streaming class driver, &quot;AVStream&quot;. Beginning with Windows XP, hardware acceleration was also added for DirectSound capture effects processing such as Acoustic Echo Cancellation for USB microphones, noise suppression and array microphone support.

===Windows Vista/Windows 7===
Windows Vista features a completely re-written audio stack based on the &quot;Universal Audio Architecture&quot;. Because of the architectural changes in the redesigned audio stack, a direct path from DirectSound to the audio drivers does not exist. DirectSound, DirectMusic and other APIs such as MME are emulated as WASAPI Session instances. DirectSound runs in emulation mode on the Microsoft software mixer. The emulator does not have hardware abstraction, so there is no hardware DirectSound acceleration, meaning hardware and software relying on DirectSound acceleration may have degraded performance. It&#x27;s likely a supposed performance hit might not be noticeable, depending on the application and actual system hardware. In the case of hardware 3D audio effects played using DirectSound3D, they will not be playable; this also breaks compatibility with EAX extensions.

Third-party APIs such as ASIO and OpenAL are not affected by these architectural changes in Windows Vista, as they use IOCtl to interface directly with the audio driver. A solution for applications that wish to take advantage of hardware accelerated high-quality 3D positional audio is to use OpenAL. However, this only works if the manufacturer provides an OpenAL driver for their hardware.

===Windows 8===
WASAPI audio stack in Windows 8 introduces support for &quot;hardware offloading&quot; of multiple audio streams to the audio card for mixing and effect processing, in addition to the software processing introduced in Vista, however the functionality is only exposed for Windows Runtime apps. DirectSound&#x27;s and DirectMusic&#x27;s hardware interfaces to sound card drivers are not implemented.

===Windows CE===
Although DirectSound support was available in Windows CE versions up to 4.2, it was removed starting 5.0. Windows CE 6.0 also does not support DirectSound, instead favoring that applications be rewritten to use the Waveform Audio API.

== Replacement implementations ==
After the removal of DirectSound in Windows Vista, a few replacement implementations have appeared.

Sound Blaster&#x27;s &quot;Creative ALchemy&quot; (2007) provides hardware acceleration of DirectSound3D and Audio Effects, such as EAX. Creative ALchemy intercepts calls to DirectSound3D and translates them into OpenAL calls to be processed by supported hardware such as Sound Blaster X-Fi and Sound Blaster Audigy. For software-based Creative audio solutions, ALchemy utilizes its built-in 3D audio engine without using OpenAL at all.

Realtek, a manufacturer of integrated HD audio codecs, has a product similar to ALchemy called 3D SoundBack. C-Media, a manufacturer of PC sound card chipsets, also has a solution called Xear3D EX, although it works instead by intercepting DirectSound3D calls transparently in the background without any user intervention.

IndirectSound is a freeware library that emulates DirectSound 3D using XAudio2, without using hardware acceleration.

DSOAL is an open source library that emulates DirectSound 3D and EAX using OpenAL. Either a hardware-accelerated OpenAL implementation or OpenAL Soft (which provides HRTF) can be used.

<text>DirectMusic is a deprecated component of the Microsoft DirectX API that allows music and sound effects to be composed and played and provides flexible interactive control over the way they are played. Architecturally, DirectMusic is a high-level set of objects, built on top of DirectSound, that allow the programmer to play sound and music without needing to get quite as low-level as DirectSound. DirectSound allows for the capture and playback of digital sound samples, whereas DirectMusic works with message-based musical data. Music can be synthesized either in hardware, in the Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, or in a custom synthesizer.

== History ==
DirectMusic was first released by Microsoft in 1996 as an ActiveX control called Interactive Music Architecture (IMA). It was introduced as part of the 6.1 version of the DirectX library in February 1999 and is included in all Microsoft Windows operating systems starting with Windows 98 Second Edition. DirectMusic has since been deprecated, and is not available to 64-bit applications in Windows Vista. In Windows 7, native 64-bit support is available for the core DirectMusic API related to timestamped MIDI but not for the performance component.

== Details ==
DirectMusic provides a complete system for implementing &quot;dynamic soundtracks&quot; that take advantage of hardware acceleration, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), DirectX Media Objects (DMOs), advanced 3D positioning effects and several other features. DirectMusic provides composition and playback of dynamic musical soundtracks based on stored compositional material. Rather than a static playback, the music is generated on the fly, and is played with variations, and can respond to flexible program events. Using DirectMusic, it is possible to:

* Load and play sounds from files or resources in MIDI, WAV, or DirectMusic Producer run-time format. The small file size of DirectMusic soundtracks makes it very well suited for Web applications.
* Schedule the timing of musical events with high precision. DirectMusic allows timestamping of MIDI input data at the moment of arrival to a system wide reference clock. Music or sound effects composed for DirectMusic can be very flexible and can change dynamically over time or in response to a user event. DirectMusic addresses the problems of Windows&#x27; legacy &quot;MidiOut&quot; API, which has shaky timing and limited real-time control.
* Play from multiple sources simultaneously, each with separate timing and instrument sets.
* Send tempo changes, patch changes, and other MIDI events programmatically.
* Use Downloadable Sounds (DLS), an open standard by the MIDI Manufacturers Association, allowing developers to output &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sounds on audio hardware not equipped with &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sample-based synthesis. The downloadable sounds can be extended to include new or customized instruments.
* On computers with sound card which lack &#x27;wavetable&#x27; sample-based synthesis, DirectSound&#x27;s &quot;Software Synthesizer&quot; ensures that message-based music such as MIDI files and DirectMusic segments sound identical on all hardware configurations rather than playing differently on different computers with different sound cards. An application can also play an unlimited variety of instruments and even produce unique sounds for individual notes and velocities.
* Locate sounds in a 3D environment.
* Easily apply pitch changes, reverberation, and other effects.
* Use more than 16 MIDI channels. DirectMusic makes it possible for any number of voices to be played simultaneously, up to the limits of the synthesizer.
* Play segments on different audio paths, so that effects or spatialization can be applied individually to each sound.
* Capture MIDI data, or stream it from one port to another.
* DirectMusic Producer can be used to create sound files that take full advantage of DirectMusic&#x27;s interactive features.
* Uses a portion of main memory as the buffer for sound card.

To ensure DirectMusic functions such as Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth work correctly, a WDM sound driver is recommended in Windows 98 or Windows Me. On Microsoft Windows Vista, DirectMusic uses only software synthesis. Also, the DirectMusic kernel mode synthesizer that supplies the DirectMusic components with a high-resolution timer has been removed.

<doc id="700218" wikidata="Q962763" url="?curid=700218" title="DirectShow">
<text>DirectShow (sometimes abbreviated as DS or DShow), codename Quartz, is a multimedia framework and API produced by Microsoft for software developers to perform various operations with media files or streams. It is the replacement for Microsoft&#x27;s earlier Video for Windows technology. Based on the Microsoft Windows Component Object Model (COM) framework, DirectShow provides a common interface for media across various programming languages, and is an extensible, filter-based framework that can render or record media files on demand at the request of the user or developer. The DirectShow development tools and documentation were originally distributed as part of the DirectX SDK. Currently, they are distributed as part of the Windows SDK (formerly known as the Platform SDK).

Microsoft plans to completely replace DirectShow gradually with Media Foundation in future Windows versions. One reason cited by Microsoft is to provide &quot;much more robust support for content protection systems&quot; (see digital rights management). Microsoft&#x27;s Becky Weiss confirmed in 2006 that &quot;you&#x27;ll notice that working with the Media Foundation requires you to work at a slightly lower level than working with DirectShow would have. And there are still DirectShow features that aren&#x27;t (yet) in Media Foundation&quot;. As described in the Media Foundation article, Windows Vista and Windows 7 applications use Media Foundation instead of DirectShow for several media related tasks.

==History==
The direct predecessor of DirectShow, ActiveMovie (codenamed Quartz), was designed to provide MPEG-1 support for Windows. It was also intended as a future replacement for media processing frameworks like Video for Windows and the Media Control Interface, which had never been fully ported to a 32-bit environment and did not utilize COM.

The development team used a pre-existing modular digital-media-processor project codenamed &quot;Clockwork&quot; as a basis for DirectShow. Clockwork had previously been used in the Microsoft Interactive Television project.

The project was initially named &quot;ActiveMovie&quot;, and was released in May 1996, bundled with the beta version of Internet Explorer 3.0. In March 1997, Microsoft announced that ActiveMovie would become part of the DirectX 5 suite of technologies, and around July started referring to it as DirectShow, reflecting Microsoft&#x27;s efforts at the time to consolidate technologies that worked directly with hardware under a common naming scheme. DirectShow became a standard component of all Windows operating systems starting with Windows 98; however it is available on Windows 95 by installing the latest available DirectX redistributable. In DirectX version 8.0, DirectShow became part of the core DirectX SDK along with other DirectX APIs.

In October 2004, DirectShow was removed from the main DirectX distribution and relocated to the DirectX Extras download. In April 2005, DirectShow was removed entirely from DirectX and moved to the Windows SDK starting with the Windows Server 2003 SP1 version of the SDK. The DirectX SDK was, however, still required to build some of the DirectShow samples.

Since November 2007, DirectShow APIs are part of the Windows SDK. It includes several new enhancements, codecs and filter updates such as the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) and DXVA 2.0 (DirectX Video Acceleration).

==Architecture==
DirectShow divides a complex multimedia task (e.g. video playback) into a sequence of fundamental processing steps known as filters. Each filterwhich represents one stage in the processing of the datahas input and/or output &quot;pins&quot; that may be used to connect the filter to other filters. The generic nature of this connection mechanism enables filters to be connected in various ways so as to implement different complex functions. To implement a specific complex task, a developer must first build a filter graph by creating instances of the required filters, and then connecting the filters together.

There are three main types of filters:

;Source filters: These provide the source streams of data. For example, reading raw bytes from any media file.
;Transform filters: These transform data that is provided from other filter&#x27;s output. For example, doing a transform such as adding text on top of video or uncompressing an MPEG frame.
;Renderer filters: These render the data. For example, sending audio to the sound card, drawing video on the screen or writing data to a file.

During the rendering process, the filter graph searches the Windows Registry for registered filters and builds its graph of filters based on the locations provided. After this, it connects the filters together, and, at the developer&#x27;s request, executes (i.e., plays, pauses, etc.) the created graph. DirectShow filter graphs are widely used in video playback (in which the filters implement functions such as file parsing, video and audio demultiplexing, decompressing and rendering) as well as for video and audio recording, editing, encoding, transcoding or network transmission of media. Interactive tasks such as DVD navigation may also be controlled by DirectShow.

In the above example, from left to right, the graph contains a &quot;source filter&quot; to read an MP3 file, stream splitter and decoder filters to parse and decode the audio, and a &quot;rendering filter&quot; to play the raw audio samples. Each filter has one or more pins that can be used to connect that filter to other filters. Every pin functions either as an output or input source for data to flow from one filter to another. Depending on the filter, data is either &quot;pulled&quot; from an input pin or &quot;pushed&quot; to an output pin in order to transfer data between filters. Each pin can only connect to one other pin and they have to agree on what kind of data they are sending.

Most filters are built using a set of C++ classes provided in the DirectShow SDK, called the DirectShow Base Classes. These handle much of the creation, registration and connection logic for the filter. For the filter graph to use filters automatically, they need to be registered in a separate DirectShow registry entry as well as being registered with COM. This registration can be managed by the DirectShow Base Classes. However, if the application adds the filters manually, they do not need to be registered at all. Unfortunately, it is difficult to modify a graph that is already running. It is usually easier to stop the graph and create a new graph from scratch. Starting with DirectShow 8.0, dynamic graph building, dynamic reconnection, and filter chains were introduced to help alter the graph while it was running. However, many filter vendors ignore this feature, making graph modification problematic after a graph has begun processing.

Although DirectShow is capable of dynamically building a graph to render a given media type, in certain instances it is difficult for developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer.

==Features==
By default, DirectShow includes a number of filters for decoding some common media file formats such as MPEG-1, MP3, Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, MIDI, media containers such as AVI, ASF, WAV, some splitters/demultiplexers, multiplexers, source and sink filters, some static image filters, some video acceleration, and minimal digital rights management (DRM) support. DirectShow&#x27;s standard format repertoire can be easily expanded by means of a variety of filters, enabling DirectShow to support virtually any container format and any audio or video codec. For example, filters have been developed for Ogg Vorbis, Musepack, and AC3, and some codecs such as MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile, AAC, H.264, Vorbis and containers MOV, MP4 are available from 3rd parties like ffdshow, K-Lite, and CCCP. Incorporating support for additional codecs such as these can involve paying the licensing fees to the involved codec technology developer or patent holder. Finally, there are &quot;bridge&quot; filters that simultaneously support multiple formats, as well as functions like stream multiplexing, by exposing the functionality of underlying multimedia APIs such as VLC.

The amount of work required to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically from a source such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer may be able to manually create a filter graph from a source file, possibly with the addition of a custom filter, and then let DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer must build the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer must create a custom filter before a filter graph can be built.

Unlike the main C API of QuickTime where it is necessary to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a media file, DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, nothing special is required for loading a URL instead of a local file on diskDirectShow&#x27;s filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an ActiveX control) have reduced this disparity.

==DirectShow Editing Services==
&quot;DirectShow Editing Services&quot; (DES), introduced in DirectX 8.0/Windows XP is an API targeted at video editing tasks and built on top of the core DirectShow architecture. &quot;DirectShow Editing Services&quot; was introduced for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Movie Maker. It includes APIs for timeline and switching services, resizing, cropping, video and audio effects, as well as transitions, keying, automatic frame rate and sample rate conversion and such other features which are used in non-linear video editing allowing creation of composite media out of a number of source audio and video streams. DirectShow Editing Services allow higher-level run-time compositing, seeking support, and graph management, while still allowing applications to access lower-level DirectShow functions.

While the original API is in C++, DirectShow Editing Services is accessible in any Microsoft .NET compatible language including Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual Basic by using a third-party code library called &quot;DirectShowNet Library&quot;. Alternatively, the entire DirectShow API, including DirectShow Editing Services, can be accessed from Borland Delphi 5, 6 and 7, C++ Builder 6, and from later versions with a few minor modifications, using a third party software library called &quot;DSPack&quot;.

As of March, 2012 (and, apparently as early as 2009), Microsoft has stated that the DirectShow Editing Services &quot;API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.&quot;

==Video rendering filters==
Originally, in Windows 9x, DirectShow used the &quot;Video Renderer&quot; filter. This drew the images using DirectDraw 3, but could also fall back to GDI or overlay drawing modes in some circumstances (depending upon the visibility of the video window and the video card&#x27;s capabilities). It had limited access to the video window. Video for Windows had been plagued with deadlocks caused by applications&#x27; incorrect handling of the video windows, so in early DirectShow releases, the handle to the playback window was hidden from applications. There was also no reliable way to draw caption text or graphics on top of the video.

DirectShow 6.0, released as part of DirectX Media introduced the &quot;Overlay Mixer&quot; renderer designed for DVD playback and broadcast video streams with closed captioning and subtitles. The &quot;Overlay Mixer&quot; uses DirectDraw 5 for rendering. Downstream connection with the &quot;Video Renderer&quot; is required for window management. &quot;Overlay Mixer&quot; also supports Video Port Extensions (VPE), enabling it to work with analog TV tuners with overlay capability (sending video directly to a video card via an analog link rather than via the PCI bus). &quot;Overlay Mixer&quot; also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated.

Starting with Windows XP, a new filter called the &quot;Video Mixing Renderer 7&quot; (&quot;VMR-7&quot; or sometimes just referred to as &quot;VMR&quot;) was introduced. The number 7 was because VMR-7 only used DirectDraw version 7 to render the video and did not have the option to use GDI drawing. The main new feature of VMR-7 was the ability to mix multiple streams and graphics with alpha blending, allowing applications to draw text and graphics over the video and support custom effects. It also featured a &quot;windowless mode&quot; (access to the composited image before it is rendered) which fixed the problems with access to the window handle.

DirectX 9 introduced &quot;VMR-9&quot;, which is included in Windows XP SP2 and newer. This version uses Direct3D 9 instead of DirectDraw, allowing developers to transform video images using the Direct3D pixel shaders. It is available for all Windows platforms as part of the DirectX 9 redistributable. As &quot;VMR-7&quot; it provides a Windowless Mode. However, unlike &quot;Overlay mixer&quot; or &quot;VMR-7&quot; it does not support video ports. Using the /3GB boot option may cause VMR-9 to fail.

Windows Vista and Windows 7 ship with a new renderer, available as both a Media Foundation component and a DirectShow filter, called the &quot;Enhanced Video Renderer&quot; (&quot;EVR&quot;). EVR is designed to work with Desktop Window Manager and supports DXVA 2.0, which is available on Windows Vista and Windows 7. It offers better performance and better quality according to Microsoft.

==Reception==

===Awards===
On January 8, 2007. Microsoft received the Emmy award for Streaming Media Architectures and Components at the 58th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards.

===Simplicity===
Commanding DirectShow to play a file is a relatively simple task. However, while programming more advanced customizations, such as commanding DirectShow to display certain windows messages from the video window or creating custom filters, many developers complain of difficulties. It is regarded as one of Microsoft&#x27;s most complex development libraries/APIs.

Developers rarely create DirectShow filters from scratch. Rather, they employ DirectShow Base Classes. The Base Classes can often simplify development, allowing the programmer to bypass certain tasks. However, the process may remain relatively complex; the code found in the Base Classes is nearly half the size of the entire MFC library. As a result, even with the Base Classes, the number of COM objects that DirectShow contains often overwhelms developers. In some cases, DirectShow&#x27;s API deviates from traditional COM rules, particularly with regard to the parameters used for methods. To overcome their difficulties with DirectShow&#x27;s unique COM rules, developers often turn to a higher level API that uses DirectShow, notably, &quot;Windows Media Player SDK&quot;, an API provides the developer with an ActiveX Control that has fewer COM interfaces to deal with.

Although DirectShow is capable of dynamically building a graph to render a given media type, in certain instances it is difficult for developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable. It is possible for filter graphs to change over time as new filters are installed on the computer.

===Codec hell===
Codec hell (a term derived from DLL hell) is when multiple DirectShow filters conflict for performing the same task. A large number of companies now develop codecs in the form of DirectShow filters, resulting in the presence of several filters that can decode the same media type. This issue is further exacerbated by DirectShow&#x27;s merit system, where filter implementations end up competing with one another by registering themselves with increasingly elevated priority.

Microsoft&#x27;s Ted Youmans explained that &quot;DirectShow was based on the merit system, with the idea being that, using a combination of the filter’s merit and how specific the media type/sub type is, one could reasonably pick the right codec every time. It wasn&#x27;t really designed for a competing merit nuclear arms race.&quot;

A tool to help in the troubleshooting of &quot;codec hell&quot; issues usually referenced is the GSpot Codec Information Appliance, which can be useful in determining what codec is used to render video files in AVI and other containers. GraphEdit can also help understanding the sequence of filters that DirectShow is using to render the media file. Codec hell can be resolved by manually building filter graphs, using a media player that supports ignoring or overriding filter merits, or by using a filter manager that changes filter merits in the Windows Registry.

==End-user tools==

DirectShow, being a developer-centric framework and API, does not directly offer end-user control over encoding content, nor does it incorporate a user interface for encoding using installed codecs or to different formats; instead, it relies on developers to develop software using the API. In contrast, other multimedia frameworks such as QuickTime or Video for Windows allow end-users to perform basic video-related tasks such as re-encoding using a different codec and editing files and streams. The convenience offered by an end-user GUI is apparent since the AVI format and codecs used by Video for Windows still remain in use, for example VirtualDub.

<text>David Tod (February 21, 1805 – November 13, 1868) was an American politician and industrialist from the U.S. state of Ohio. As the 25th governor of Ohio, Tod gained recognition for his forceful and energetic leadership during the American Civil War.

A Democrat who supported the war effort, Tod helped to maintain a fragile alliance between the state&#x27;s Republicans and War Democrats and took steps to secure Ohio&#x27;s borders. In 1863, the state&#x27;s pro-Union party failed to nominate Tod for a second term because of his tepid support for the abolition of slavery and his unpopularity among the state&#x27;s myriad political factions.

After completing his two-year term as Ohio governor, Tod turned down an invitation to serve in the government of President Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of the Treasury, citing poor health. Tod died of a stroke in 1868, three years after the end of the war and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery (Youngstown, Ohio).

A biography of David Tod by Joseph Lambert Jr. was published in 2023. The Political Transformation of David Tod is the title.

==Early life==
Tod was born in Youngstown, Ohio, to a family actively involved in local and state politics. His father, George Tod, born to a Scottish immigrant in Suffield, Connecticut, had relocated to the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1800. There, George Tod pursued a career in public life, serving as an Ohio lawmaker between 1804 and 1806, and winning a seat as a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1807.

David Tod attended Burton Academy in Geauga County and studied law in Warren, where he was appointed postmaster. Admitted to the Ohio bar in 1827, he accumulated considerable wealth as a lawyer actively involved in the coal and iron industries of the Mahoning Valley, and he went on to become president of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad.

==Early political career==
Tod was in the Ohio State Senate from 1838 to 1840. He was a candidate for Ohio&#x27;s governorship as a Democrat in 1844 and 1846, running on a strongly anti-national bank platform, but lost both elections. He was appointed by President James K. Polk as minister (ambassador) to Brazil from 1847 to 1851. He presided over the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore after the resignation of Caleb Cushing as convention president.

Although previously a strong Democrat, Tod joined the pro-Union alliance between the Republican Party and Ohio&#x27;s War Democrats at the outset of the Civil War. On September 5, 1861, Republicans and War Democrats met in Columbus, Ohio, to form the National Union Party. The newly established party promptly abandoned the state&#x27;s beleaguered Republican governor, William Dennison, and threw its support behind Toda move designed to strengthen solidarity between War Democrats and Republicans.

Meanwhile, the War Democrats who had not joined the National Union Party nominated Hugh J. Jewett, who called for reconciliation with the South but &quot;stopped short of taking a strong antiwar stance&quot;. Tod won the election, polling 206,997 votes to Jewett&#x27;s 151,774—a result that indicated the National Union Party had made few inroads among Democratic voters. Tod ultimately served one term as governor, leading the state from 1862 to 1864.

==Civil War governor==

Governor Tod faced significant difficulties in encouraging military recruitment and providing for Ohio troops in the field, but gained the nickname &quot;the soldier&#x27;s friend&quot;. As historian George W. Knepper observed, the governor was compelled, near the outset of his administration, to &quot;deal with the highly emotional aftermath of the battle of Shiloh&quot;, a costly victory in which Ohio alone suffered 2,000 casualties. Several months later, when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson threatened Washington, D.C., Tod was able to secure 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service. He was less successful, however, in filling Ohio&#x27;s federally mandated quota of 74,000 troops. In time, he advocated federal conscription, writing to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, &quot;With this Ohio will... respond to any further calls made upon her, but without it would be impossible to raise any considerable number&quot;. Among those Ohioans who participated in the war effort was Tod&#x27;s nephew, Brigadier General James Hobart Ford, who served in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the War.

States could use their own tax money to supplement the work of the United States Sanitary Commission as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor Tod, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee in April 1862, it send 3 steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals loaded with doctors, nurses and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to eleven hospital ships. The state also set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes across the Midwest to assist Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.

Tod was challenged to maintain the state&#x27;s security during the war, calling out the militia to respond to a cavalry raid by Confederate Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan from July 12 to 26, 1863, and arranging for the compensation of Ohioans whose property had been confiscated by Morgan&#x27;s men. Damages inflicted upon Ohio residents reached $576,225, &quot;while the expense of keeping the militia in the field raised the total cost to well over a million dollars&quot;. At the same time, as historian Richard H. Abbott observed, Tod also &quot;battled with recalcitrant Democrats, unruly newspaper editors, draft rioters, and strange secret societies&quot;. He was compelled to call out troops to bring an end to draft riots in Holmes County, which became popularly known as the &quot;Battle of Fort Fizzle&quot;.

He recommended the federal military arrest of Copperhead leaders such as Dr. Edson B. Olds—who sued him for kidnapping and actually had the governor briefly arrested, before the Supreme Court of Ohio issued a writ of habeas corpus–and Clement Vallandigham. In 1862, he attended the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately backed Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation and the Union war effort. At the same time, Tod resisted the idea of using black troops in the war effort. When black abolitionist leader John Mercer Langston urged the governor to enlist African-American soldiers to help the state fill its draft quotas, Tod responded sharply, saying, &quot;Do you not know, Mr. Langston, that this is a white man&#x27;s government; that white men are able to defend and protect it?&quot; Nevertheless, by 1863, blacks were being enrolled in Ohio&#x27;s volunteer units, and more than 5,000 served in state or federal units.
==Later years==

Tod was unable to secure the pro-Union renomination in 1863, losing it to another War Democrat, John Brough, who enjoyed greater popularity among Ohioans and more actively supported the anti-slavery direction the Northern war effort had by then taken. President Abraham Lincoln then offered Tod the post of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, telling an aide, &quot;He is my friend, with a big head full of brains... he made a good governor, and has made a fortune for himself&quot;. Tod, knowing he was not radical enough for Republicans in the United States Senate and in fragile health, declined the appointment. Tod died of a stroke in 1868, at the age of 63, leaving a widow and seven children. He was a Republican Presidential elector in 1868 for Grant/Colfax. He died before the meeting of electors, and was replaced by G. V. Dorsey.

Since his death, Tod has gained recognition as an effective political leader who guided his state through a difficult period. As Delmer J. Trester wrote: &quot;His administration was characterized by intense patriotism, devotion to duty, administrative ability, and unflagging energy. Ohio was fortunate to have David Tod as one of its war governors&quot;.

Tod is honored with a full-size bronze depiction inside the Cuyahoga County Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Cleveland, Ohio for his service as governor during the Civil War.

<doc id="700235" wikidata="Q2655512" url="?curid=700235" title="Acura CL">
<text>The Acura CL is a midsize four passenger coupe manufactured and marketed by Honda&#x27;s Acura brand across two generations from 1996 until 2003. 

All Acura CLs were manufactured at Honda&#x27;s plant in East Liberty, Ohio with the Honda Civic. The second generation TL and the Honda Accord upon which the Acura CLs were based, are manufactured at Honda&#x27;s plant in Marysville, Ohio. The CL was the first Acura to be built in the United States.

With the release of the TL and 3.5RL in 1996, Acura transitioned to alphanumeric and/or two-letter names. 

== Acura CL-X ==
The Acura CL-X is a concept car built by Acura (in conjunction with its parent company Honda) for the 1995 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It was designed in Honda&#x27;s R&amp;D North America studio in Los Angeles. It is a two-dour coupe with a wheelbase of and a track width of . The concept was shown to preview the styling and body style of what would become the CL. The particular car shown had special carbon fiber and aluminum composite wheels designed for performance, with a staggered wheel setup of 18 inches in the front and 19 inches in the rear. It was reported to have a top speed of .
==First generation (1996–1999)==

The Acura CL entered production in February 1996. For the 1996 and 1997 model year, the CL was offered with either a 3.0 L &quot;J30&quot; V6 producing , or a 2.2 L (F22B1) I4 engine. The 1998 and 1999 models featured a 2.3 L 4-cylinder (F23A1) engine with .

Both the 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder CL offered a &quot;Premium&quot; trim level which offered leather upholstery (with heated front seats in the 3.0), and in the 3.0, an Acura/Bose stereo. For the 1999 model year, the &quot;Premium&quot; trim level was eliminated, and leather upholstery became standard on all models, as was a trunk cargo net. The alloy wheel design was different on the 3.0 for each year, moving from a five-spoke design (MY 1997) to a seven-spoke design (MY 1998), to a different multi-spoke alloy design for the 1999 model year. The 2.2/2.3 CL used a six-spoke design for 1997, then moved to a 5-spoke double-prong design for 1998 and 1999. The 4-cylinder model had an option for a 5-speed manual transmission. The CL also featured galvanized body panels which helps to prevent rust.

* 1996–1999 Acura CL 3.0 L V6 – 
* 1996–1997 Acura CL 2.2 L I4 – 
* 1997–1999 Acura CL 2.3 L I4 – 

==Second generation (2000–2003)==

For the 1999 model year, the Acura CL&#x27;s sibling, the TL, was redesigned. The CL, however, was never produced as a 2000 model and instead in March 2000 the completely redesigned Acura CL was released as a 2001 model featuring a 3.2 L SOHC VTEC &quot;J-series&quot; V6. A navigation system was also available along with the Type-S model, denoting Acura&#x27;s &#x27;Sport&#x27; edition. While the regular CL featured a V6, the Type-S boasted a V6 with 17-inch wheels, a firmer suspension, slightly larger brakes, and firmer seats. At the time, the Type-S was the most powerful front-wheel drive vehicle Honda had ever manufactured.

In 2002, the CL Type-S was offered, as a 2003 model, with a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission with a helical limited-slip differential. The 6-speed CL deleted some minor interior features from the automatic, such as a center console light. Also, the heated seats only featured one heat setting (vs. high and low in the auto). VSA and TCS were also not found on the 6-speed car, and as such, a 3-channel ABS unit was used. One of the main criticisms of the CL was that a manual transmission had been dropped when the car was redesigned for the 2001 model year. Very few manual transmission models were built; there were 2,690 without navigation and 824 with navigation, for a total of 3,514 in the US market. An additional 331 cars were produced for the Canadian market, all without navigation. Despite such small numbers of manual transmissions, there was still a greater demand than Acura had expected. The 6-speed car was highly praised by critics, with one calling it &quot;the high point of Acura performance outside the NSX and Integra Type-R&quot;. However, with the CL&#x27;s sister car, the TL, coming up on a redesign for the 2004 model year, the CL was dropped from Acura&#x27;s lineup with no mid-size luxury coupe replacement. Total Acura CL sales from 2000 until 2003, when the last new model was sold, was less than 31,000 units. The CL&#x27;s manual transmission survives in the third-generation TL and 7th generation Honda Accord.

The 2003 model year also brought cosmetic changes to the CL. The 5-watt road/fog lamps found on the 2001–02 models were deleted, and non-functional air vents were installed in their place. The grille surround and door handles were now body color, as opposed to being chrome on the 01–02. The side mirrors were also redesigned (for both the 2002 and 2003 models) by having a more square shape, full-body matched paint, and tinted glass since customers had complained about excessive wind noise coming from the mirror seam. The 2003 models also saw new headlights which now featured a blacked-out interior, and the taillight lenses had a cleared turn signal and reverse light. Type-S&#x27;s now included updated 17 × 7&quot; 12-spoke wheels. Revised thicker exhaust tips were also a new addition. Canadian CLs offer daytime running lights and a windshield washer fluid level sensor as standard equipment (USDM CLs do not have these as an option).

* 2000–2003 Acura 3.2 CL – , mpg: 17 city/27 hwy. (5AT)
* 2000–2003 Acura 3.2 CL Type S – at 6,100 rpm, at 3,500–5,500 rpm. mpg: 19 city/29 hwy (6MT), 17 city/27 hwy. (5AT)

===High-performance models===
In 2002, Honda Access America developed a performance package for the CL Type S, which was built in concert with tuning firm Comptech. A specially designed Eaton twin-screw Roots-type supercharger was coupled with numerous suspension, exhaust, braking, and drivetrain enhancements. 0 to 60 mph times of the coupe were reduced from 6.0 seconds on a stock Type S to 5.7 seconds with the modifications. Output was claimed to be at 6,800 rpm and of torque at 5,400 rpm (both measured at the crank), with a fuel economy rating of . The complete tuning and appearance package added $22,412 to the $31,050 base price of the CL Type S.
===Automatic transmission concerns===
Problems have been seen with the second-generation CL models equipped with automatic transmissions (manual transmission models are unaffected). Reports say that after an average of around 40,000 miles, the transmission experiences gear failures, such as downshifts, slipping, flaring and not shifting, and leaking.

One main cause is excessive wear of the 3rd gear clutch pack, resulting in large amounts of debris blocking the flow of transmission fluid. Many owners reported problems with the replacement transmissions as well. Similar transmission-related issues exist in the Honda Accord, Acura MDX, Acura TL as well as the Honda Odyssey.

Due to many failures, the manufacturer extended the warranty on the automatic transmission on some CLs and TLs for 7 years, . Many replacement rebuilt units had problems. A class-action lawsuit later extended the warranty to 93 months or . Despite the conversion to kilometers, the class action settlement applies only for persons and entities residing in the United States.

In addition, there was an unrelated transmission recall for safety reasons. One gear tended to overheat, break and cause the transmission to lock up. Since this failure would cause the car to come to a sudden stop, this might cause accidents. Further information on the transmission issue was available on enthusiast forums and at the official Acura Service Bulletin.

<doc id="700241" wikidata="Q1134223" url="?curid=700241" title="National Statuary Hall Collection">
<text>The National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol is composed of statues donated by individual states to honor persons notable in their history. Limited to two statues per state, the collection was originally set up in the old Hall of the House of Representatives, which was then renamed National Statuary Hall. The expanding collection has since been spread throughout the Capitol and its visitor center.

With the addition of New Mexico&#x27;s second statue in 2005, the collection is now complete with 100 statues contributed by 50 states, plus two from the District of Columbia. Since Congress authorized replacements in 2000, twelve states have replaced at least one of their original two statues. In 2022, Kansas became the first state to replace both of its statues; it has been joined by Arkansas and Nebraska.

==History==
The concept of a National Statuary Hall originated in the middle of the nineteenth century, before the completion of the present House wing in 1857. At that time, the House of Representatives moved into its new larger chamber and the old vacant chamber became a thoroughfare between the Rotunda and the House wing. Suggestions for the use of the chamber were made as early as 1853 by Gouverneur Kemble, a former member of the House, who pressed for its use as a gallery of historical paintings. The space between the columns seemed too limited for this purpose, but it was well suited for the display of busts and statuary.

On April 19, 1864, Representative Justin S. Morrill asked: &quot;To what end more useful or grand, and at the same time simple and inexpensive, can we devote it [the Chamber] than to ordain that it shall be set apart for the reception of such statuary as each State shall elect to be deserving of in this lasting commemoration?&quot; His proposal to create a National Statuary Hall became law on July 2, 1864:

Originally, all state statues were placed in National Statuary Hall. However, the aesthetic appearance of the Hall began to suffer from overcrowding until, in 1933, the situation became unbearable. At that time the Hall held 65 statues, which stood, in some cases, three deep. More important, the structure of the chamber would not support the weight of any more statues. Therefore, in 1933 Congress passed a resolution that:

Under authority of this resolution it was decided that only one statue from each state should be placed in Statuary Hall. The others would be given prominent locations in designated areas and corridors of the Capitol. A second rearrangement of the statues was made in 1976 by authorization of the Joint Committee on the Library. To improve the crowded appearance of the collection, thirty-eight statues were rearranged in Statuary Hall according to height and material. Statues representing ten of the thirteen original colonies were moved to the Central Hall of the East Front Extension on the first floor of the Capitol. The remainder of the statues were distributed throughout the Capitol, mainly in the Hall of Columns and the connecting corridors of the House and Senate wings. Legislation was introduced in 2005 that would authorize the collection to include one statue from each U.S. Territory; it did not pass.

Each statue is the gift of a state, not of an individual or group of citizens. Proceedings for the donation of a statue usually begin in the state legislature with the enactment of a resolution that names the citizen to be commemorated and cites his or her qualifications, specifies a committee or commission to represent the state in selecting the sculptor, and provides for a method of obtaining the necessary funds to carry the resolution into effect. In recent years, the statues have been unveiled during ceremonies in the Rotunda and displayed there for up to six months. They are then moved to a permanent location approved by the Joint Committee on the Library. An act of Congress (), enacted in 2000, permits states to provide replacements and repossess the earlier one.

A special act of Congress, , signed on December 1, 2005, directed the Joint Committee on the Library to obtain a statue of Rosa Parks and to place the statue in the United States Capitol in National Statuary Hall in a suitable permanent location. On February 27, 2013, Parks became the first African-American woman to have her likeness in the Hall. Though located in Statuary Hall, Parks&#x27; statue is &quot;not&quot; part of the Collection; neither Alabama (her birth state) nor Michigan (where she lived most of her later years) commissioned it, and both states are represented in the Collection by other statues.

In 2002, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill in Congress to allow the District of Columbia to place two statues in the collection, in parity with the 50 states. While the bill was not enacted, the district commissioned two statues, one of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the other of D.C. master planner Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, and housed them in One Judiciary Square in hopes of eventually placing them in the Capitol. A 2010 version of the bill to accept D.C.&#x27;s statues stalled after House Republicans began adding amendments in an attempt to soften D.C.&#x27;s gun laws. A 2012 compromise bill led to the placement of the statue of Douglass, but not L&#x27;Enfant, on June 19, 2013. Norton continued to pursue legislation to move the second statue to the Capitol. The statue of L&#x27;Enfant was later placed in the Capitol in February 2022.

Amid national debates about Confederate statues and monuments, Democrats in Congress introduced bills in 2017 to remove statues of people who served in the Confederacy from the National Statuary Hall Collection, but the legislation made no progress. Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, and Virginia have passed resolutions to remove statues of individuals with Confederate ties, although Alabama retained a second statue of a Confederate veteran. North Carolina and Arkansas have authorized replacing statues of Jim Crow-era politicians with racist views.

==Demographics==

===Women===
There are fourteen statues of women representing states in the collection:
* Frances E. Willard (Illinois), the first statue of a woman in the collection, was also sculpted by a woman, Helen Farnsworth Mears.
* Helen Keller (Alabama)
* Florence R. Sabin (Colorado)
* Maria Sanford (Minnesota)
* Jeannette Rankin (Montana), the first woman elected to the House and, famously, the only Member of Congress to vote against U.S. entry into both World Wars.
* Sacagawea (North Dakota), one of the six Native Americans in the collection.
* Sarah Winnemucca (Nevada), one of the six Native Americans in the collection.
* Mother Joseph (Washington), a native of Canada.
* Esther Hobart Morris (Wyoming)
* Mary McLeod Bethune (Florida)
* Amelia Earhart (Kansas)
* Willa Cather (Nebraska)
* Daisy Bates (Arkansas)
* Martha Hughes Cannon (Utah)

The statue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol does not represent a state and &quot;is not a part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.&quot; A statue of Barbara Johns (Virginia) has been authorized.

===Native Hawaiian and Native American members===
The collection includes statues of Hawaiian king Kamehameha I and of six Native Americans: Popé (New Mexico), Will Rogers (Oklahoma), Sequoyah (Oklahoma), Sacagawea (North Dakota), Washakie (Wyoming), and Sarah Winnemucca (Nevada). Nebraska has authorized the addition of a statue of Chief Standing Bear, and Washington has authorized a statue of Billy Frank Jr.

===Members of Hispanic descent===
Dennis Chávez, the first person of Hispanic descent to be elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate, represents New Mexico. Saint Junípero Serra, born in Spain, was a Spanish-era founder of the California mission system.

===African-American members===
In February 2013, a statue of Rosa Parks was placed as the first full-length statue of an African American in the Capitol. It did not represent a particular state, but was commissioned directly by Congress. A few months later, on Juneteenth, 2013, a statue of Frederick Douglass was placed in the Capitol Visitor Center as a gift of the District of Columbia. There are also busts of Martin Luther King Jr. (1986) and Sojourner Truth (2009).

Until 2018, no state had designated an African American as one of its two statues. In March 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed legislation to replace the statue of Edmund Kirby Smith with one of African American educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. The new statue was unveiled July 13, 2022. In April 2019, Arkansas also authorized a statue of Daisy Bates, which was installed in May 2024. In December 2020, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced that the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee would be replaced by a statue of African American civil rights activist Barbara Johns.

===Catholic clergy and nun===

The collection includes Father Damien from Hawaiʻi, Father Jacques Marquette from Wisconsin, Father Junipero Serra from California, and Father Eusebio Kino from Arizona, as well as Mother Joseph Pariseau from Washington.

===Confederates===
The collection contains several statues of leaders of the Confederate States of America. These include CSA President Jefferson Davis and Vice President Alexander Stephens and Confederate soldiers, most in Confederate Army uniforms: Generals Joseph Wheeler, James Z. George, Wade Hampton III, as well as Colonel Zebulon Baird Vance and former enlisted soldiers John E. Kenna and Edward Douglass White.

Alabama replaced its statue of Confederate politician and army officer Jabez Curry in 2009. In 2018 the Florida legislature voted to replace its statue of Confederate general Edmund Kirby Smith with a statue of African American educator and Civil Rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune; Smith&#x27;s statue was removed in 2021 ahead of the unveiling of Bethune&#x27;s statue in 2022. In 2019, Arkansas decided to replace both its statues, including the one of Uriah M. Rose, with civil rights activist Daisy Bates and Johnny Cash. In 2020, Virginia decided to replace its statue of Robert E. Lee, which had stood in the collection since 1909, with one of Barbara Rose Johns Powell and the Lee statue was removed December 20–21, 2020. A statue of Uriah M. Rose, &quot;an attorney who sided with the Confederacy&quot; and was the chancellor of Pulaski County, Arkansas, while Arkansas was part of the Confederacy, was replaced with a statue of civil rights activist Daisy Bates.

==Collection==
==Replacement of statues==

A 2000 change in the law allows a state to remove a previously placed statue from the collection and replace it with another. Since then, thirteen states have replaced statues and other states have either considered or passed legislation calling for replacing one or both of their statues.

===Replacements===

* Alabama replaced its statue of Jabez Curry in 2009 with one of Helen Keller. The Curry statue is now in the Alabama Department of Archives and History in Montgomery.
* Arizona replaced its statue of John Campbell Greenway in 2015 with one of Barry Goldwater. The Greenway statue is now at the Polly Rosenbaum Archives and History Building near the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix.
* Arkansas replaced its statue of U. M. Rose with one of Daisy Bates.
* Arkansas replaced its statue of James P. Clarke with one depicting musician Johnny Cash.
* California replaced its statue of Thomas Starr King with one of Ronald Reagan in 2009. The King statue now stands in Capitol Park at the California State Capitol in Sacramento.
* Florida replaced its statue of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith with one of the African-American civil rights activist and educator Mary McLeod Bethune on July 13, 2022, pursuant to a 2018 state law. The Smith statue was to have been moved to the Lake County Historical Museum in Tavares, after residents of St. Augustine, his birthplace, expressed no interest. However, at a County Commission meeting on July 24, 2018, about 24 residents spoke against, and none in favor, of bringing the statue to Lake County. Chairman Sullivan assured the crowd that the commission would tell the Historical Museum &quot;that there is no longer a want or desire to bring this statue to Lake County&quot;.
* Iowa replaced its statue of James Harlan in 2014 with one of Norman Borlaug, who is considered the founder of the Green Revolution. The Harlan statue is now displayed at Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.
* Kansas replaced its statue of George Washington Glick with one of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 2003. The Glick statue now resides at the Kansas State Historical Society in Topeka. Almost 20 years later, in 2022, the Kansas legislature approved replacing the statue of John James Ingalls with one of female aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in the same 1999 resolution that authorized replacing their statue of George Washington Glick with one of Eisenhower, but progress on the project was stalled by funding and paperwork delays. The Ingalls statue was replaced overnight on July 26 and the Earhart statue was unveiled on July 27 of the same year. It is unknown what will happen with the Ingalls statue now.
* Michigan replaced its statue of Zachariah Chandler with one of Gerald Ford in 2011. The Chandler statue is now in the atrium of Constitution Hall in Lansing, Michigan.
*Missouri: In 2002, Governor Bob Holden signed a resolution to add a statue of President Harry S. Truman to the collection, but nothing happened for years after the state&#x27;s request to the Architect of the Capitol was improperly filed. In 2019 a new resolution for a Truman statue passed the state senate and was forwarded to the Missouri House. The Truman Library Institute commissioned Kansas City sculptor Tom Corbin to create the statue, with a target completion date of 2020, the 75th anniversary of Truman&#x27;s inauguration. It was finally installed in September 2022, replacing the statue of Thomas Hart Benton. Benton&#x27;s statue was moved to the State Historical Society of Missouri in Columbia.
* Nebraska: In 2018, the Nebraska legislature passed LB 807, calling for the replacement of both of the state&#x27;s statues, which date to 1937. It replaced Its statue of William Jennings Bryan with one of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. The Standing Bear statue is the work of Ben Victor, who created two similar statues of the chief that were previously installed in Nebraska, and was installed in September 2019. The Bryan statue was relocated to the Nebraska National Guard Museum in Seward, Nebraska. In 2023, a statue of author Willa Cather was installed, replacing a statue of Julius Sterling Morton. Its sculptor, Littleton Alston, is the first Black sculptor to create a statue for the National Statuary Hall Collection. The Morton statue was relocated to a library in Nebraska City, Nebraska.
* North Carolina: On October 2, 2015, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory signed a bill replacing the statue of Charles Aycock with one of Reverend Billy Graham. However, the replacement was delayed because the statues must represent deceased individuals; Reverend Graham did not die until February 2018. One week after Graham&#x27;s death, McCrory&#x27;s successor, Roy Cooper, submitted a formal request for replacement of the Aycock statue. The North Carolina Statuary Hall Selection Committee issued a request for proposals for the statue indicating a desired completion date of September 2020. The statue of Billy Graham was installed in National Statuary Hall in May 2024.
* Ohio replaced its statue of William Allen with one of inventor and businessman Thomas Edison in 2016. Allen&#x27;s statue was returned to his hometown of Chillicothe.
* Utah: On April 4, 2018, Governor Gary Herbert signed legislation replacing its statue of Philo Farnsworth with a statue sculpted by Ben Hammond of Martha Hughes Cannon, the first woman elected as a state senator in US history. The statue of Martha Hughes Cannon was installed on December 12, 2024.

===Replacement pending===
*Michigan On December 6, 2022, the Michigan Legislature adopted a resolution to replace the state&#x27;s statue of Lewis Cass with a statue of Coleman Young, the first Black mayor of Detroit.
*Virginia: A state commission suggested to the Governor to replace Virginia&#x27;s statue of Robert E. Lee with one of civil rights activist Barbara Johns in December 2020. The statue of Lee was removed on December 21, 2020. The statue will be sculpted by Steven Weitzman and is expected to be installed in 2024.
*Washington: Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill in April 2021 that starts the process to replace Washington&#x27;s Marcus Whitman statue with one of Billy Frank Jr.

===Considered for replacement===
* California: A resolution to replace California&#x27;s statue of Junípero Serra with one of astronaut Sally Ride passed the state senate in April 2015, but the vote in the state assembly was placed on hold as the date for Serra&#x27;s canonization as a saint approached. Governor Jerry Brown declared in July 2015 that the Serra statue would stay in the Capitol &quot;until the end of time.&quot;
* New Jersey: A bill to replace New Jersey&#x27;s statue of Philip Kearny with one of suffragist Alice Paul passed the state Senate on February 10, 2020.

===Rejected replacements===
* Maryland: In 2011, a citizens&#x27; petition was rejected by the Maryland General Assembly. The petition requested that a statue of Harriet Tubman replace John Hanson, the 1781 President of the Continental Congress and a merchant slaveholder.

<doc id="700244" wikidata="Q7398483" url="?curid=700244" title="Safe Havens">
<text>Safe Havens is a comic strip drawn by cartoonist Bill Holbrook. It was originally syndicated by Washington Post Writers Group starting October 3, 1988 as a weekday only strip (opposite the Sunday only strip &quot;Outland&quot; by Berkeley Breathed), the strip switched to King Features Syndicate in 1993. The strip has been published in more than 50 newspapers. The strip originally concerned the group of pre-schoolers at Safe Havens Day Care, but has focused on Samantha and followed her as she has grown up (approximately in real-time) and gone through elementary school, high school, college, and (currently) marriage. The comic then went online in 2010.

The strip is located near the seashore in the fictional city of Havens, several hundred miles from the state capital. However, in 2018 the setting changed to a spaceship on a crewed mission to Mars that lasted until January 2021.

==Characters==
Samantha, Jenny, and Dave are the only original characters left from the Day Care. Roger entered shortly after the strip began. The strip&#x27;s original main character, a boy named Matt who was the son of the day care operator, was dropped early in the elementary school stretch.

===The &quot;Other Clique&quot;===
These are our main characters. The souls who never fit into any of the school&#x27;s official catalog of Cliques, so they were listed in the box marked &quot;Other.&quot; Their own mascot is (appropriately) a cat who is the clone of a dog. They are always open to new members.

Samantha Argus - Samantha is the main character, a woman with a hopeful nature and a genius scientific mind. However, she is a bit of a control freak and often attempts to help people, even when they don&#x27;t need it. Her technical side enables her to see the world rationally and realistically, which comes in handy when you&#x27;re surrounded by a mermaid, the spirit of a late grandmother, living dust bunnies and a genetic mishap that turned the family border collie into a school guidance counselor. She is now married to Dave Hamper and gave birth to their firstborn in September 2018. Her role on the mission to Mars was commander, or as she puts it, &quot;Rocket Administrator&quot;. Since the mission&#x27;s return she has been named head of the genetics lab where Rupert and Rosalind work.

Dave Hamper - Dave is dyslexic, but found that instead of it being a disability it&#x27;s simply an alternate yet perfectly viable way of interfacing with the world. He uses his unique special talents to achieve stardom on the basketball court. He was stationed with &quot;Nuova Pallacanestro Firenze&quot;, a team in Florence, Italy, but retired in 2016 due to an ACL injury. He is married to Samantha Argus, who he has been soulmates with since almost the beginning. His role on the mission to Mars was Pilot.

Jenny Fuerte - Jenny is vain, shallow and self-centered, possessing a set of personal ethics that could charitably be called &quot;situational&quot;. She is everything that Samantha is not. Contrastingly, the two have been friends since preschool. She has been Dave and Bambi&#x27;s agent since college. She is married to Luis Fuerte and has a daughter, Candide.

Thomas Volant - Thomas is naturally acrobatic, has since infancy preferred being on a trapeze. He has performed for Cirque du Soleil. He is married to Remora and they have a son, Marlon, who took after him by hanging on a trapeze. His role on the mission to Mars was co-pilot.

Roger - Roger has been practising to become a mascot his entire life. Rarely seen outside of costume, he was the mascot of the Havens High School Fighting Personal Digital Assistants (the team used to be called the Lions until a &quot;contribution&quot; from a high-tech firm resulted in the name change). Roger takes his mascot role incredibly seriously, communicating entirely through the costume&#x27;s screen display. Roger&#x27;s face has never been shown since he is always wearing some sort of full-body costume. Even in the day care, he wore a box, and then made it into a television costume. He was on the mission to Mars as the Main Computer interface.

Remora - Remora is a 415-year-old mermaid who has decided to live on land for a while. Like all merfolk, she has the option of living 24 hours a day as half-fish, half human (i.e., Mermaid Classic), or for twelve hours fully human followed by twelve hours as a fish. In summer of 2006, she decided to take a vacation in the ocean with friends. From that time, she spent the summer months at sea. She and Thomas Volant have a son, Marlon, who has exhibited traits of both Remora&#x27;s merfolk heritage and Thomas&#x27; acrobatic predilection. She was on the mission to Mars as the grower of organic foodstuffs in the water tank. During the loss of ship emergency at the end of the mission she shape-shifted and ended as half-human half-octopus.

Bambi Bramante - Bambi&#x27;s goal in life was to be a successful poet, but frequently suffered from writer&#x27;s block. However, her life plans took a different path after it was discovered that she had a wonderful singing voice, and she became the songwriter and lead singer of the clique&#x27;s garage band, the Safe Havens. Jenny signed them to a record contract, but the label only wanted Bambi. So she soon embarked on a solo career. However, her own self doubts and esteem issues caused her issues, and to help keep her head above water, members of the &quot;Other&quot; clique would accompany her on the tour. She was on the mission to Mars as token celebrity to keep the media on them, and was writing and recording her next album while on the trip. In 2020 she and Maria fell in love and became a couple.

Luis Fuerte - A hunk with eyeglasses, Hispanic background and a wheelchair. He joins the &quot;Other&quot; clique in High School. He is an excellent mechanic and a clandestine inventor, evident as the creator of an extendable arm that provides Samantha with a convenient alibi during a basketball game (strips of December 1–5, 2008). He is married to Jenny and is the father of Candide. His role on the mission to Mars is chief mechanic.

Gerald, Lisa, and Winston - All members of the &quot;Other Clique&quot; in junior and senior high school. However, following high school they went elsewhere to college and were written out of the comic.

Ming - Ming is only honorarily a member of the &quot;other clique&quot;. A &quot;goth&quot; enthusiast with a flair for the extreme and avant-garde, introduced when Dave Hamper was traded to another high school for his senior year. Initially a pseudo-rival to Samantha for Dave (she always wore sunglasses a la Dave, shedding them only when she got married), she was eventually accepted into the group and joined everyone at Havens University as a creative film major. She shared a college dorm room with Samantha, Remora and Jenny before marrying Don Delft, a former teammate of Dave on the college&#x27;s basketball team who was drafted by the NBA in the spring of 2008. Don is so tall that his face was never seen; his head extended above the top of the strip until he posed for a family portrait with his new baby on January 2, 2012. Ming and Don&#x27;s son is Clay.

===Samantha&#x27;s family===
Donald Argus - Donald is the safety inspector at Fastrack, Inc. (in crossover with &quot;On the Fastrack&quot;, another comic strip by Holbrook) and is more frequently seen in that comic.

Jeanine Argus - Started on the school board when Samantha was in high school, then became a state senator. In 2008, she was elected lieutenant governor. After one term was elected governor in 2012. Initially, Jeanine seemed clueless as to the genetic (and other) shenanigans that occurred around Samantha&#x27;s life, but it is later revealed that she knew the whole time and was ready to step in if Samantha couldn&#x27;t fix anything. In 2021 she is president of Beige University.

Sophie Argus - Samantha&#x27;s little sister. She accidentally drank some butterfly DNA as a child and was thus enhanced with extreme grace and agility which she uses to take up dancing.

Shondra Argus - Shondra left school to become an artist and lived in the state capitol. However, she became disillusioned with that lifestyle in her 30s and returned to college, where she took courses to become a relationship counselor.

Sylvester and Steve - Rarely seen, Sylvester and Steve are Samantha&#x27;s older brothers. Both went into business related fields and only ever seen on the holidays.

Grandma Argus - When the mother of Samantha&#x27;s mom died, she left Samantha a magic ring. When wearing it, Samantha can speak to her grandmother in any reflection. A former daredevil with a wealth of adventurous experiences, she sees her post-life duty as making sure Samantha doesn&#x27;t spend her years glued to the front of a computer screen.

Laptop aka Dr. Brenda Scrim - Originally, the Argus&#x27;s pet border collie (it was later discovered she was also half cat), Laptop later created a fictional character of Brenda Scrim to pose as the Guidance Counselor for Havens Junior High School. When it became apparent she was needed personally, she took a genetic concoction created by Samantha to become human. She later chose this as her permanent life, becoming the high school counselor and later Jeanine&#x27;s political adviser. She was originally married to Dave&#x27;s dog Clive until his death, and later married the state&#x27;s governor (while Jeanine was lieutenant governor). She is the adopted mother of Palmtop, her genetic clone, and was the legal guardian of Remora.

Palmtop aka Pam Topp - Samantha&#x27;s first genetic experiment, Palmtop is genetic clone of Samantha&#x27;s border collie Laptop. She was gestated in a cat and was born a cat (this was later discovered being due to Laptop being a dog/cat hybrid). Palmtop originally showed more of a canine personality than a feline, but this would later change as she developed a snarky feline persona. She briefly had a romance with an escaped lab experiment and they had a litter of striped puppies which were adopted by many of the main characters (most have since been written out). Palmtop eventually became human under the unfortunate name &quot;Pam Topp&quot;, and served as the Residential Adviser in Samantha&#x27;s old dorm. More recently she has decided to live as a cat, in Vince and Feryl&#x27;s home, and only occasionally transforms into Pam Topp.

===Residents of Havens===

Miss Callowood - Miss Callowood was the kids&#x27; elementary school teacher for several years. She had been rather trendy before becoming a teacher and had several facial piercings, although her face was never actually seen. She left teaching after getting married and having a child, and would only be seen during the Junior High years when Samantha would babysit for her. She returned occasionally during the High School and College years after it was discovered Dave was dyslexic, as a special needs teacher to help Dave learn to read.

Miss Havens - Miss Havens was the operator of the day care and Matt&#x27;s mother. She also was dropped when the kids entered elementary school, although she returned for a couple years as the day care teacher for the new generation. She also prepared the children&#x27;s lesson plans for while they are on the mission to Mars.

===Beige University characters===
Rupert and Rosalind - Samantha&#x27;s research assistants. Accident prone, they frequently suffer from genetic mishaps that result in them changing into other animals or assuming their traits. They are married and have a son, Gregor, who has inherited some Venus Flytrap DNA and thus has green skin, conducts photosynthesis, and likes to chomp things that fly.

Patina and Rusty Welding - Crossover characters from On the Fastrack, Patina goes to college at Beige University, is the Residential Adviser in Samantha&#x27;s old dorm, originally alongside Palmtop, and is currently seen more often here than in &quot;On The Fastrack&quot;. Samantha entrusted her genetic supplies to Patina for safe-keeping during her expedition to Mars. During the expedition Rusty also enrolled at Beige University and replaced Pam Topp as the other resident advisor. One of their current jobs is to keep the media away from Samantha and Dave.

Vince Vole - A mouse that was turned into a human after an accident. He&#x27;s decided to stay human and works in Samantha&#x27;s lab and is an English major. He occasionally turns back into a mouse for the summer, and has since lost his tail in an accident. He dated and later married Feryl Farnsworth; they have a daughter named Morgana, appropriately for two people who give magic shows.

Feryl Farnsworth - Formerly a dove that as a chick got turned into a human accidentally, and was raised as the daughter of the scientist/magician that transformed her; she occasionally turns back into a dove. She married Vince Vole, and they have a human daughter, named Morgana, appropriately for two magicians. She, and Vince, and Pam Topp regularly give magician shows for children, in which one of them is in animal form for the show. While Samantha was off to Mars only Vince transformed, because they were short of transformational elixir and Patina Welding was rationing it.

Maria - A former time traveler, served as doctor on the mission to Mars. She and Bambi fell in love, became a couple and now live together. She corrected Leo, saying that she can&#x27;t time-travel any more because then she will be unable to return to this time the same time as her younger self Maria Hamper. See Leo and Maria Hamper below.

The Dodos, Paul and Mary - Samantha&#x27;s graduate thesis work was to recreate and study the extinct species of dodo. To do this she found and extrapolated dodo DNA and turned two chickens into Dodos. Much to her surprise, she discovers that dodos were intelligent beings capable of speech, but have little to no sense of morals, ethics or self-preservation. They constantly seek fame and fortune, and it has since been an ongoing task to keep them out of trouble. They joined the mission to Mars as stowaways, and decided to remain there after the planet developed an ecosystem.

Stan - Stan is a giant spider that lives in the duct work in the lab, and was tasked with keeping the dodos from escaping.

===The Children, aka &quot;The Next Generation&quot;===

All of these children were also on the Mission to Mars.

Marlon Fontenalia-Volant Marlon is the son of Remora and Thomas and the eldest of the children. He takes after his father&#x27;s acrobatic inclinations, and prefers to hang from a trapeze. In 2014, Marlon began to show Remora&#x27;s aquatic merfolk heritage as well, and has to spend 12 hours a day as a fish.

Candide Fuerte - Luis and Jenny&#x27;s first child, born New Year&#x27;s, 2012, simultaneously with Clay. Very competitive with Clay. She shows her mother&#x27;s tendency for material acquisition.

Clay Delft - Don and Ming&#x27;s first child, born New Year&#x27;s, 2012, simultaneously with Candide. Very competitive with Candide.

Leo - Son of Maria, see above. Leo is also a time traveler. He will grow up to be Leonardo da Vinci.

Maria Hamper - Sam and Dave&#x27;s first child, born September 2018. The strip of May 20, 2020 states that Maria will grow up to be Leo&#x27;s mother. The same week Leo says that his mother can not come visit &#x27;here&#x27; because she can not be in the same time space as her toddler self Maria Hamper.

<text>William Dennison Jr. (November 23, 1815 – June 15, 1882) was a Whig and Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 24th governor of Ohio and as U.S. Postmaster General in the Cabinet of President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Born in Cincinnati, Dennison graduated from Miami University, studied law, and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1840. A canny businessman, he led the Exchange Bank and the Columbus and Xenia Railroad, and organized the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad, while becoming active in politics.

In 1840, he married Anne Eliza Neil, the daughter of the wealthy Columbus businessman William Neil, whose farm later became the campus of Ohio State University. Together, William and Anne Dennison had seven children. The eldest of them was a son, William Neil Dennison, who later won distinction in the Civil War while serving in the U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade.

William Dennison Jr. was one of the first major Ohio politicians to leave the dying Whig Party for the new Republican Party. He rose quickly through the party ranks due to his anti-slavery and anti-discrimination efforts in the Ohio State Senate. Dennison was elected to the governorship in 1859, defeating Rufus P. Ranney, and served a single term from 1860 to 1862. Before the outbreak of the American Civil War, he refused the demands of Kentucky and Virginia state authorities for the extradition of fugitive slaves or the punishment of those who helped them.

==Civil War==
With turmoil growing in the neighboring Virginia and many states in the south seceding, Dennison, like the governors of most other states, set immediately to recruiting troops and mustering militia to defend his state. When Lincoln issued the proclamation for 75,000 in militia, Dennison was requested from Washington by wire to raise thirteen regiments of militia, but he wired back that he &quot;could hardly stop before twenty&quot; due to the large turnout of recruits and his concern that secessionist troops could attack Ohio from the direction of Northwest Virginia. Dennison, unfamiliar with military affairs, was like the governors of Pennsylvania, New York, and Michigan searching for qualified military men to command their growing state militia, and none was more sought after than George B. McClellan at the time, owing to his former experience and tour to the Crimean war. McClellan set out to his native state of Pennsylvania, where he wished to take command of the state militia, and its governor had even dispatched by wire the offer to McClellan, offering him command of the state militia, but it had not arrived. McClellan stopped at Columbus on his way to Pennsylvania to discuss the military situation in the Ohio valley with Dennison. Dennison was impressed with him and offered him command of the state militia on the spot. Dennison later tried but failed to be elected to the United States Senate in 1861, when he was defeated by John Sherman.

Dennison and his cabinet observed the ominous developments in north-western Virginia throughout mid-April 1861 to May of that year, where northwestern Virginians were convening to secede from eastern Virginia, and pro-union sentiment was common and widespread. Richmond at the same time was also vying to send troops to the area to suppress these secessionist activities. Many Northwestern Virginians wrote to Dennison requesting him to send troops from Ohio to the area to defend from possible reprisals from east Virginia, the editor of the Wheeling Intelligencer wrote a letter to Dennison encouraging him to occupy NW Virginia, writing that &quot;Secession is creeping up&quot;, and that &quot;Union men in Northwestern Virginia will shortly be slaughtered&quot;. Without being asked by the War Department, he sent Ohio troops under George McClellan into western Virginia at May 4 1861, where they guarded the Wheeling Convention, which eventually led to the admission of West Virginia as a free state. He also took the initiative to seize control of Ohio&#x27;s railroads and telegraph lines early in the war to allow military usage, angering Peace Democrats in the Ohio Legislature. He denounced secession and Ohio&#x27;s &quot;Copperheads&quot;, established a consistent supply of arms and equipment for the new troops, and was a vocal supporter of Lincoln&#x27;s policies. During his term, he raised over 100,000 troops and organized 82 three-years regiments for the Union army.

However, errors by the Governor and his subordinates led the state&#x27;s alliance of Republicans and War Democrats to drop Dennison as a candidate in 1862. The parties turned instead to David Tod, a War Democrat. Historian Richard H. Abbott wrote, &quot;No Ohio chief executive [before Dennison] had ever exercised such powers and fulfilled such duties with a greater sense of public responsibility and determination. Nevertheless...politics dictated his demise.&quot;

Dennison accepted this turn of events with good grace, capably advised his successor, and provided valuable services in helping recruit black troops for Ohio units. He served as Chairman of the Republican National Convention in 1864. He was appointed U.S. Postmaster General by President Abraham Lincoln, and served from 1864 to 1866, leaving the Cabinet after he decided he could no longer support the policies of President Andrew Johnson.

==Postbellum career and memorialization==
After the war, Dennison served on the Columbus City Council and organized the Franklin County Agricultural Society. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him a Commissioner for the District of Columbia, the highest governing office of Washington, D.C., in which Dennison served from 1874 to 1878, acting in the capacity of a board president at all meetings he attended (no provision had been made for a president of the board, and none was ever formally elected). He sought the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1880, but was defeated by James Garfield. Dennison remained active in state and national politics until his death. He left behind a widow and seven children, and was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio.

Of Dennison&#x27;s single term in the opening stages of the Civil War, historian John S. Stilt wrote, &quot;His wisdom and foresight were appreciated by few and condemned by many... It is doubtful whether any of his predecessors could have met the issues any more successfully.&quot;

Camp #1 of the Department of Ohio of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War is named for Governor William Dennison. It was chartered August 1, 1882, shortly after Dennison&#x27;s June 15, 1882 death at age 66.

The William Dennison school in Washington, DC, named in his honor, was opened in 1885 on S Street between 13th and 14th Streets, NW. It closed sometime after 1947 and was razed prior to 1985.

Dennison is honored with a full-size bronze depiction inside the Cuyahoga County Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in Cleveland, Ohio for his service as governor during the Civil War.

Camp Dennison is a census-designated place (CDP) just outside Indian Hill in southern Symmes Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. It has a post office with the ZIP code 45111.[3] The population was 375 at the 2010 census. The community was settled in 1796 by German immigrants.[5] During the American Civil War, Camp Dennison served as a military recruiting and training post for the United States Army (see Camp Dennison). It is named for William Dennison, the 24th Governor of Ohio and U.S. Postmaster General under President Abraham Lincoln.

<text>Video game development (sometimes shortened to gamedev) is the process of creating a video game. It is a multidisciplinary practice, involving programming, design, art, audio, user interface, and writing. Each of those may be made up of more specialized skills; art includes 3D modeling of objects, character modeling, animation, visual effects, and so on. Development is supported by project management, production, and quality assurance. Teams can be many hundreds of people, a small group, or even a single person.

Development of commercial video games is normally funded by a publisher and can take two to five years to reach completion. Game creation by small, self-funded teams is called independent development. The technology in a game may be written from scratch or use proprietary software specific to one company. As development has become more complex, it has become common for companies and independent developers alike to use off-the-shelf &quot;engines&quot; such as Unity, Unreal Engine or Godot.

Commercial game development began in the 1970s with the advent of arcade video games, first-generation video game consoles like the Atari 2600, and home computers like the Apple II. Into the 1980s, a lone programmer could develop a full and complete game such as &quot;Pitfall!&quot;. By the second and third generation of video game consoles in the late 1980s, the growing popularity of 3D graphics on personal computers, and higher expectations for visuals and quality, it became difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream video game. The average cost of producing a high-end (often called AAA) game slowly rose from 1–4 million in 2000, to over $200 million and up by 2023. At the same time, independent game development has flourished. The best-selling video game of all time, &quot;Minecraft&quot;, was initially written by one person, then supported by a small team, before the company was acquired by Microsoft and greatly expanded.

Mainstream commercial video games are generally developed in phases. A concept is developed which then moves to pre-production where prototypes are written and the plan for the entire game is created. This is followed by full-scale development or &quot;production&quot;, then sometimes a post-production period where the game is polished. It has become common for many developers, especially smaller developers, to publicly release games in an &quot;early access&quot; form, where iterative development takes place in tandem with feedback from actual players.

== Overview ==

Games are produced through the software development process. Games are developed as a creative outlet and to generate profit. Game making is considered both art and science. Development is normally funded by a publisher. Well-made games bring profit more readily. However, it is important to estimate a game&#x27;s financial requirements, such as development costs of individual features. Failing to provide clear implications of game&#x27;s expectations may result in exceeding allocated budget. In fact, the majority of commercial games do not produce profit. Most developers cannot afford to change their development schedule midway, and require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production.

The game industry requires innovations, as publishers cannot profit from the constant release of repetitive sequels and imitations. Every year new independent development companies open and some manage to develop hit titles. Similarly, many developers close down because they cannot find a publishing contract or their production is not profitable. It is difficult to start a new company due to the high initial investment required. Nevertheless, the growth of the casual and mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams to enter the market. Once the companies become financially stable, they may expand to develop larger games. Most developers start small and gradually expand their business. A developer receiving profit from a successful title may store up capital to expand and re-factor their company, as well as tolerate more failed deadlines.

An average development budget for a multiplatform game is US$18-28M, with high-profile games often exceeding $40M.

In the early era of home computers and video game consoles in the early 1980s, a single programmer could handle almost all the tasks of developing a game — programming, graphical design, sound effects, etc. It could take as little as six weeks to develop a game. However, the high user expectations and requirements of modern commercial games far exceed the capabilities of a single developer and require the splitting of responsibilities. A team of over a hundred people can be employed full-time for a single project.

Game development, production, or design is a process that starts from an idea or concept. Often the idea is based on a modification of an existing game concept. The game idea may fall within one or several genres. Designers often experiment with different combinations of genres. A game designer generally writes an initial game proposal document, that describes the basic concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, and finally staff and budget estimates. Different companies have different formal procedures and philosophies regarding game design and development. There is no standardized development method; however commonalities exist.
A game developer may range from a single individual to a large multinational company. There are both independent and publisher-owned studios. Independent developers rely on financial support from a game publisher. They usually have to develop a game from concept to prototype without external funding. The formal game proposal is then submitted to publishers, who may finance the game development from several months to years. The publisher would retain exclusive rights to distribute and market the game and would often own the intellectual property rights for the game franchise. The publisher may also own the development studio, or it may have internal development studio(s). Generally the publisher is the one who owns the game&#x27;s intellectual property rights.

All but the smallest developer companies work on several titles at once. This is necessary because of the time taken between shipping a game and receiving royalty payments, which may be between 6 and 18 months. Small companies may structure contracts, ask for advances on royalties, use shareware distribution, employ part-time workers and use other methods to meet payroll demands.

Console manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony, have a standard set of technical requirements that a game must conform to in order to be approved. Additionally, the game concept must be approved by the manufacturer, who may refuse to approve certain titles.

Most modern PC or console games take from three to five years to complete, whereas a mobile game can be developed in a few months. The length of development is influenced by a number of factors, such as genre, scale, development platform and number of assets.

Some games can take much longer than the average time frame to complete. An infamous example is 3D Realms&#x27; &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, announced to be in production in April 1997 and released fourteen years later in June 2011. Planning for Maxis&#x27; game &quot;Spore&quot; began in late 1999; the game was released nine years later in September 2008. The game &quot;Prey&quot; was briefly profiled in a 1997 issue of PC Gamer, but was not released until 2006, and only then in highly altered form. Finally, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; was in development from 1998 until its 2007 release, and emerged from a convoluted development process involving &quot;probably three or four different games&quot;, according to Gabe Newell.

The game revenue from retail is divided among the parties along the distribution chain, such as — developer, publisher, retail, manufacturer and console royalty. Many developers fail to profit from this and go bankrupt. Many seek alternative economic models through Internet marketing and distribution channels to improve returns, as through a mobile distribution channel the share of a developer can be up to 70% of the total revenue and through an online distribution channel owned by the developer almost 100%.

== History ==

The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games, although which video game is the first depends on the definition of &quot;video game&quot;. The first games created had little entertainment value, and their development focus was separate from user experience—in fact, these games required mainframe computers to play them. &quot;OXO&quot;, written by Alexander S. Douglas in 1952, was the first computer game to use a digital display. In 1958, a game called &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, which displayed its output on an oscilloscope, was made by Willy Higinbotham, a physicist working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1961, a mainframe computer game called &quot;Spacewar!&quot; was developed by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students led by Steve Russell.

True commercial design and development of games began in the 1970s, when arcade video games and first-generation consoles were marketed. In 1971, &quot;Computer Space&quot; was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips. In 1972, the first home console system was released called Magnavox Odyssey, developed by Ralph H. Baer. That same year, Atari released &quot;Pong&quot;, an arcade game that increased video game popularity. The commercial success of &quot;Pong&quot; led other companies to develop &quot;Pong&quot; clones, spawning the video game industry.

Programmers worked within the big companies to produce games for these devices. The industry did not see huge innovation in game design and a large number of consoles had very similar games. Many of these early games were often &quot;Pong&quot; clones. Some games were different, however, such as &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, which was significant for several reasons: an early 1975 on-foot, multi-directional shooter, which depicted game characters, game violence, and human-to-human combat. Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s original version was based on discrete logic, which Dave Nutting adapted using the Intel 8080, making it the first video game to use a microprocessor. Console manufacturers soon started to produce consoles that were able to play independently developed games, and ran on microprocessors, marking the beginning of second-generation consoles, beginning with the release of the Fairchild Channel F in 1976.

The flood of &quot;Pong&quot; clones led to the video game crash of 1977, which eventually came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito&#x27;s 1978 arcade shooter game &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market. Its creator Nishikado not only designed and programmed the game, but also did the artwork, engineered the arcade hardware, and put together a microcomputer from scratch. It was soon ported to the Atari 2600, becoming the first &quot;killer app&quot; and quadrupling the console&#x27;s sales. At the same time, home computers appeared on the market, allowing individual programmers and hobbyists to develop games. This allowed hardware manufacturer and software manufacturers to act separately. A very large number of games could be produced by an individual, as games were easy to make because graphical and memory limitation did not allow for much content. Larger companies developed, who focused selected teams to work on a title. The developers of many early home video games, such as &quot;Zork&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Air Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Adventure&quot;, later transitioned their work as products of the early video game industry.

The industry expanded significantly at the time, with the arcade video game sector alone (representing the largest share of the gaming industry) generating higher revenues than both pop music and Hollywood films combined. The home video game industry, however, suffered major losses following the video game crash of 1983. In 1984 Jon Freeman warned in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;:

Chris Crawford and Don Daglow in 1987 similarly advised prospective designers to write games as a hobby first, and to not quit their existing jobs early. The home video game industry was revitalized soon after by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in 1986 stated that although individuals developed most early video games, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible for one person to have the multiple talents necessary to create a good game&quot;. By 1987 a video game required 12 months to develop and another six to plan marketing. Projects remained usually solo efforts, with single developers delivering finished games to their publishers. With the ever-increasing processing and graphical capabilities of arcade, console, and computer products, along with an increase in user expectations, game design moved beyond the scope of a single developer to produce a marketable game. The &quot;Gazette&quot; stated, &quot;The process of writing a game involves coming up with an original, entertaining concept, having the skill to bring it to fruition through good, efficient programming, and also being a fairly respectable artist&quot;. This sparked the beginning of team-based development. In broad terms, during the 1980s, pre-production involved sketches and test routines of the only developer. In the 1990s, pre-production consisted mostly of game art previews. In the early 2000s, pre-production usually produced a playable demo.

In 2000 a 12 to 36 month development project was funded by a publisher for US$1M–3M. Additionally, $250k–1.5M were spent on marketing and sales development. In 2001, over 3000 games were released for PC; and from about 100 games turning profit only about 50 made significant profit. In the early 2000s it became increasingly common to use middleware game engines, such as &quot;Quake&quot; engine or Unreal Engine.

In the early 2000s, also mobile games started to gain popularity. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained a marginal form of gaming until the Apple App Store was launched in 2008.

In 2005, a mainstream console video game cost from US$3M to $6M to develop. Some games cost as much as $20M to develop. In 2006 the profit from a console game sold at retail was divided among parties of distribution chain as follows: developer (13%), publisher (32%), retail (32%), manufacturer (5%), console royalty (18%). In 2008 a developer would retain around 17% of retail price and around 85% if sold online.

Since the third generation of consoles, the home video game industry has constantly increased and expanded. The industry revenue has increased at least five-fold since the 1990s. In 2007, the software portion of video game revenue was $9.5 billion, exceeding that of the movie industry.

The Apple App Store, introduced in 2008, was the first mobile application store operated directly by the mobile-platform holder. It significantly changed the consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content and quickly broadened the markets of mobile games.

In 2009 games&#x27; market annual value was estimated between $7–30 billion, depending on which sales figures are included. This is on par with films&#x27; box office market. A publisher would typically fund an independent developer for $500k–$5M for a development of a title. In 2012, the total value had already reached $66.3 billion and by then the video game markets were no longer dominated by console games. According to Newzoo, the share of MMO&#x27;s was 19.8%, PC/MAC&#x27;s 9.8%, tablets&#x27; 3.2%, smartphones 10.6%, handhelds&#x27; 9.8%, consoles&#x27; only 36.7% and online casual games 10.2%. The fastest growing market segments being mobile games with an average annual rate of 19% for smartphones and 48% for tablets.

In the past several years, many developers opened and many closed down. Each year a number of developers are acquired by larger companies or merge with existing companies. For example, in 2007 Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s parent company, Vivendi Games merged with Activision. In 2008 Electronic Arts nearly acquired Take-Two Interactive. In 2009 Midway Games was acquired by Time-Warner and Eidos Interactive merged with Square Enix.

== Roles ==

=== Producer ===

Development is overseen by internal and external producers. The producer working for the developer is known as the &quot;internal producer&quot; and manages the development team, schedules, reports progress, hires and assigns staff, and so on. The producer working for the publisher is known as the &quot;external producer&quot; and oversees developer progress and budget. Producer&#x27;s responsibilities include PR, contract negotiation, liaising between the staff and stakeholders, schedule and budget maintenance, quality assurance, beta test management, and localization. This role may also be referred to as &quot;project manager&quot;, &quot;project lead&quot;, or &quot;director&quot;.

=== Publisher ===

A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by an external video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product&#x27;s manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.

They usually finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio. Consequently, they also typically own the IP of the game. Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish.

Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design.

Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality.

Because the publisher usually finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties. These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development, called milestones.

Independent video game developers create games without a publisher and may choose to digitally distribute their games.

=== Development team ===

Developers can range in size from small groups making casual games to housing hundreds of employees and producing several large titles. Companies divide their subtasks of game development. Individual job titles may vary; however, roles are the same within the industry. The development team consists of several members. Some members of the team may handle more than one role; similarly, more than one task may be handled by the same member. Team size can vary from 3 to 100 or more members, depending on the game&#x27;s scope. The most represented are artists, followed by programmers, then designers, and finally, audio specialists, with one to three producers in management. Many teams also include a dedicated writer with expertise in video game writing. These positions are employed full-time. Other positions, such as testers, may be employed only part-time. Use of contractors for art, programming, and writing is standard within the industry. Salaries for these positions vary depending on both the experience and the location of the employee.

A development team includes these roles or disciplines:

==== Designer ====

A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game. Development teams usually have a lead designer who coordinates the work of other designers. They are the main visionaries of the game. One of the roles of a designer is being a writer, often employed part-time to conceive the game&#x27;s narrative, dialogue, commentary, cutscene narrative, journals, video game packaging content, hint system, etc. In larger projects, there are often separate designers for various parts of the game, such as, game mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, graphics, etc.

==== Artist ====
A game artist is a visual artist who creates video game art. The art production is usually overseen by an &quot;art director&quot; or &quot;art lead&quot;, making sure their vision is followed. The art director manages the art team, scheduling and coordinating within the development team.

The artist&#x27;s job may be 2D oriented or 3D oriented. &quot;2D artists&quot; may produce concept art, sprites, textures, environmental backdrops or terrain images, and user interface. &quot;3D artists&quot; may produce models or meshes, animation, 3D environment, and cinematics. Artists sometimes occupy both roles.

==== Programmer ====

A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software (such as game development tools). The game&#x27;s codebase development is handled by programmers. There are usually one to several lead programmers, who implement the game&#x27;s starting codebase and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules. An entry-level programmer can make, on average, around $70,000 annually and an experienced programmer can make, on average, around $125,000 annually.

Individual programming disciplines roles include:
* Physics – the programming of the game engine, including simulating physics, collision, object movement, etc.;
* AI – producing computer agents using game AI techniques, such as scripting, planning, rule-based decisions, etc.
* Graphics – the managing of graphical content utilization and memory considerations; the production of the graphics engine, integration of models, textures to work along the physics engine.
* Sound – integration of music, speech, and effect sounds into the proper locations and times.
* Gameplay – implementation of various game rules and features (sometimes called a &quot;generalist&quot;);
* Scripting – development and maintenance of a high-level command system for various in-game tasks, such as AI, level editor triggers, etc.
* UI – production of user interface elements, like option menus, HUDs, help and feedback systems, etc.
* Input processing – processing and compatibility correlation of various input devices, such as keyboard, mouse, gamepad, etc.
* Network communications – the managing of data inputs and outputs for local and internet gameplay.
* Game tools – the production of tools to accompany the development of the game, especially for designers and scripters.

==== Level designer ====

A level designer is a person who creates levels, challenges or missions for video games using a specific set of programs. These programs may be commonly available commercial 3D or 2D design programs, or specially designed and tailored level editors made for a specific game.

Level designers work with both incomplete and complete versions of the game. Game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use. This eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code. Level editors may involve custom high-level scripting languages for interactive environments or AIs. As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community, level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for consistency and clear layout before the required artwork is completed.

==== Sound engineer ====

Sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and sound positioning. They are sometimes involved in creating haptic feedback, as was the case with the Returnal game sound team at PlayStation Studios Creative Arts in London.
They sometimes oversee voice acting and other sound asset creation. Composers who create a game&#x27;s musical score also comprise a game&#x27;s sound team, though often this work is outsourced.

==== Tester ====

The quality assurance is carried out by game testers. A game tester analyzes video games to document software defects as part of a quality control. Testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise and analytic competence.

The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design: it both works and is entertaining. This involves testing of all features, compatibility, localization, etc. Although necessary throughout the whole development process, testing is expensive and is often actively utilized only towards the completion of the project.

== Development process ==

Game development is a software development process, as a video game is software with art, audio, and gameplay. Formal software development methods are often overlooked. Games with poor development methodology are likely to run over budget and time estimates, as well as contain a large number of bugs. Planning is important for individual and group projects alike.

Overall game development is not suited for typical software life cycle methods, such as the waterfall model.

One method employed for game development is agile development. It is based on iterative prototyping, a subset of software prototyping. Agile development depends on feedback and refinement of the game&#x27;s iterations with a gradually increasing feature set. This method is effective because most projects do not start with a clear requirement outline. A popular method of agile software development is Scrum.

Another successful method is Personal Software Process (PSP) requiring additional staff training to increase awareness of project planning. This method is more expensive and requires commitment of team members. PSP can be extended to Team Software Process, where the whole team is self-directing.

Game development usually involves an overlap of these methods. For example, asset creation may be done via waterfall model, because requirements and specification are clear, but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping.

Development of a commercial game usually includes the following stages:

=== Pre-production ===

&quot;Pre-production&quot; or &quot;design phase&quot; is a planning phase of the project focused on idea and concept development and production of initial design documents. The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation, which describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development team. The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan. This phase is usually not funded by a publisher, however good publishers may require developers to produce plans during pre-production.

The concept documentation can be separated into three stages or documents—high concept, pitch and concept; however, there is no industry standard naming convention, for example, both Bethke (2003) and Bates (2004) refer to &quot;pitch document&quot; as &quot;game proposal&quot;, yet Moore, Novak (2010) refers to &quot;concept document&quot; as &quot;game proposal&quot;.

The late stage of pre-production may also be referred to as &quot;proof of concept&quot;, or &quot;technical review&quot; when more detailed game documents are produced.

Publishers have started to expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes.

==== High concept ====

&quot;High concept&quot; is a brief description of a game. The high concept is the one-or two-sentence response to the question, &quot;What is your game about?&quot;.

==== Pitch ====

A &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;concept document&quot;, proposal document, or &quot;game proposal&quot; is a short summary document intended to present the game&#x27;s selling points and detail why the game would be profitable to develop.

Verbal pitches may be made to management within the developer company, and then presented to publishers. A written document may need to be shown to publishers before funding is approved. A game proposal may undergo one to several &quot;green-light meetings&quot; with publisher executives who determine if the game is to be developed. The presentation of the project is often given by the game designers. Demos may be created for the pitch; however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records.

If the developer acts as its own publisher, or both companies are subsidiaries of a single company, then only the upper management needs to give approval.

==== Concept ====

&quot;Concept document&quot;, &quot;game proposal&quot;, or &quot;game plan&quot; is a more detailed document than the pitch document. This includes all the information produced about the game. This includes the high concept, game&#x27;s genre, gameplay description, features, setting, story, target audience, hardware platforms, estimated schedule, marketing analysis, team requirements, and risk analysis.

Before an approved design is completed, a skeleton crew of programmers and artists usually begins work. Programmers may develop quick-and-dirty prototypes showcasing one or more features that stakeholders would like to see incorporated in the final product. Artists may develop concept art and asset sketches as a springboard for developing real game assets. Producers may work part-time on the game at this point, scaling up for full-time commitment as development progresses. Game producer&#x27;s work during pre-production is related to planning the schedule, budget and estimating tasks with the team. The producer aims to create a solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at the start of the production.

==== Game design document ====
Before a full-scale production can begin, the development team produces the first version of a game design document incorporating all or most of the material from the initial pitch. The design document describes the game&#x27;s concept and major gameplay elements in detail. It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game. The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes of some sections of the game. The design document remains a living document throughout the development—often changed weekly or even daily.

Compiling a list of game&#x27;s needs is called &quot;requirement capture&quot;.

==== Prototype ====
Writing prototypes of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different algorithms and usability scenarios for a game. A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre-production before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies. Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally, as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources on what could be a canceled idea or project. Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges.

Prototypes are often meant only to act as a proof of concept or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features. Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be ported to the game once they have been completed.

Often prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design (around 15 to 20 minutes of testing). Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these testbed tools. RAD tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs. In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy-to-access tools in order to make the prototype faster.

A successful development model is iterative prototyping, where design is refined based on current progress. There are various technology available for video game development

=== Production ===

Production is the main stage of development when assets and source code for the game are produced.

Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed. Programmers write new source code, artists develop game assets, such as, sprites or 3D models. Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game. Level designers create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and NPCs. Game designers continue to develop the game&#x27;s design throughout production.

==== Design ====
Game design is an essential and collaborative process of designing the content and rules of a game, requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills. Creativity and an open mind are vital for the completion of a successful video game.

During development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game. Features and levels are often removed or added. The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change. A new platform may be targeted as well as a new demographic. All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team. Most changes occur as updates to the design document.

==== Programming ====
The programming of the game is handled by one or more game programmers. They develop prototypes to test ideas, many of which may never make it into the final game. The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process. Even if an off-the-shelf game engine is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game.

==== Level creation ====
From a time standpoint, the game&#x27;s first level takes the longest to develop. As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher-quality development. Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete, so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded. Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time. It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years. Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable.

==== Art production ====
During development, artists make art assets according to specifications given by the designers. Early in production, concept artists make concept art to guide the artistic direction of the game, rough art is made for prototypes, and the designers work with artists to design the visual style and visual language of the game. As production goes on, more final art is made, and existing art is edited based on player feedback.

==== Audio production ====
Game audio may be separated into three categories—sound effects, music, and voice-over.

Sound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects. Sound effects include UI sound design, which effectively conveys information both for visible UI elements and as an auditory display. It provides sonic feedback for in-game interfaces, as well as contributing to the overall game aesthetic. Sound effects are important and impact the game&#x27;s delivery.

Music may be synthesized or performed live.

There are four main ways in which music is presented in a game.

* Music may be ambient, especially for slow periods of game, where the music aims to reinforce the aesthetic mood and game setting.
* Music may be triggered by in-game events. For example, in such games as Pac-Man or Mario, player picking up power-ups triggered respective musical scores.
* Action music, such as chase, battle or hunting sequences is fast-paced, hard-changing score.
* Menu music, similar to credits music, creates aural impact while relatively little action is taking place.

A game title with 20 hours of single-player gameplay may feature around 1 hour.

==== Testing ====
Quality assurance of a video game product plays a significant role throughout the development cycle of a game, though comes more significantly into play as the game nears completion. Unlike other software products or productivity applications, video games are fundamentally meant to entertain, and thus the testing of video games is more focused on the end-user experience rather than the accuracy of the software code&#x27;s performance, which leads to differences in how the game software is developed.

Because game development is focused on the presentation and gameplay as seen by the player, there often is little rigor in maintaining and testing backend code in the early stages of development since such code may be readily disregarded if there are changes found in gameplay. Some automated testing may be used to ensure the core game engine operates as expected, but most game testing comes via game tester, who enter the testing process once a playable prototype is available. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent. The use of testers may be lightweight at the early stages of development, but the testers&#x27; role becomes more predominant as the game nears completion, becoming a full-time role alongside development. Early testing is considered a key part of game design; the most common issue raised in several published post-mortems on game development was the failure to start the testing process early. 

As code matures and the gameplay features solidify, then development typically includes more rigorous test controls such as regression testing to make sure new updates to the code base do not change working parts of the game. Games are complex software systems, and changes in one code area may unexpected cause a seemingly unrelated part of the game to fail. Testers are tasked to repeatedly play through updated versions of games in these later stages to look for any issues or bugs not otherwise found from automated testing. Because this can be a monotonous task of playing the same game over and over, this process can lead to games frequently being released with uncaught bugs or glitches. 

There are other factors simply inherent to video games that can make testing difficult. This includes the use of randomized gameplay systems, which require more testing for both game balance and bug tracking than more linearized games, the balance of cost and time to devote to testing as part of the development budget, and assuring that the game still remains fun and entertaining to play as changes are made to it. 

Despite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customer dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release patches that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again. Certain publishing models are designed specifically to accommodate the fact that first releases of games may be bug-ridden but will be fixed post-release. The early access model invites players to pay into a game before its planned release and helps to provide feedback and bug reports. Mobile games and games with live services are also anticipated to be updated on a frequent basis, offset by pre-release testing with live feedback and bug reports.

=== Milestones ===
Commercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by the publisher. Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game&#x27;s progress. Such milestones may be, for example, &quot;first playable&quot;, &quot;alpha&quot;, or &quot;beta&quot; game versions. Project milestones depend on the developer schedules.

Milestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be &quot;Player roaming around in-game environment&quot; or &quot;Physics working, collisions, vehicle&quot; etc. (numerous descriptions are possible). These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as &quot;an advance against royalty&quot;. These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on the developer and publisher. The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer. The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game. When working with a good publisher, the &quot;spirit of the law&quot; is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words, if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone. It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met. Also, sometimes milestones are &quot;swapped&quot;, the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available. Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts. After each &quot;milestone&quot; there is usually a payment arrangement. Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly/quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality &quot;milestone lists&quot;.

There is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such varies depending on publisher, year, or project. Some common milestones for a two-year development cycle are as follows:

==== First playable ====

The &quot;first playable&quot; is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets, this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements. It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production. Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however, large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha. First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Pre-Alpha&quot; stage.

==== Alpha ====
&quot;Alpha&quot; is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented, and assets are partially finished. A game in alpha is &quot;feature complete&quot;, that is, the game is playable and contains all the major features. These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback. Additional small, new features may be added, and similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped. Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions.

==== Code freeze ====

&quot;Code freeze&quot; is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected. Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release.

==== Beta ====
&quot;Beta&quot; is a feature and asset complete version of the game, when only bugs are being fixed. This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable. No changes are made to the game features, assets, or code. Beta occurs two to three months before code release.

==== Code release ====

&quot;Code release&quot; is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review. This version is tested against the QA test plan. First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release.

==== Gold master ====
&quot;Gold master&quot; is the final game&#x27;s build that is used as a master for the production of the game.

==== Release schedules and &quot;crunch time&quot; ====

In most AAA game development, games are announced a year or more in advance and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game, establish orders with retailers, and entice consumers to pre-order the game. Delaying the release of a video game can have a negative financial impact on publishers and developers, and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs. To ensure a game makes a set release date, publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game, which is considered common in the industry. This overtime is often referred to as &quot;crunch time&quot; or &quot;crunch mode&quot;. In 2004 and afterwards, the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny, leading many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management, though crunch time still can occur.

=== Post-production ===

After the game goes gold and ships, some developers will give team members &quot;comp time&quot; (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard.

==== Maintenance ====
Once a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins.

Games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period in the past. The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released. This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue. In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a port, sequel, or enhanced remake that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets.

In recent times popularity of online console games has grown, and online capable video game consoles and online services such as Xbox Live for the Xbox have developed. Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches. These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the Internet.

PC development is different. Game developers try to account for the majority of configurations and hardware. However, the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to the discovery of game-breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers did not account for.

Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they&#x27;ve obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a patch. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it is intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked in past code releases, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches. Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay.

In the case of a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), such as a MMORPG or MMORTS, the shipment of the game is the starting phase of maintenance. The maintenance staff for such an online game can number in the dozens, sometimes including members of the original programming team, as the game world is continuously changed and iterated and new features are added. Some developers implement a public test realm or player test realm (PTR) in order to test out significant upcoming changes prior to release. These specialized servers offer similar benefits as beta testing, where players get to preview new features while the developer gathers data about bugs and game balance.

== Outsourcing ==

Several development disciplines, such as audio, dialogue, or motion capture, occur for relatively short periods of time. Efficient employment of these roles requires either a large development house with multiple simultaneous title productions or outsourcing from third-party vendors. Employing personnel for these tasks full-time is expensive, so a majority of developers outsource a portion of the work. Outsourcing plans are conceived during the pre-production stage; where the time and finances required for outsourced work are estimated.

* The music cost ranges based on the length of composition, method of performance (live or synthesized), and composer experience. In 2003 a minute of high-quality synthesized music cost between US$600-1.5k. A title with 20 hours of gameplay and 60 minutes of music may have cost $50k-60k for its musical score.
* Voice acting is well-suited for outsourcing as it requires a set of specialized skills. Only large publishers employ in-house voice actors.
* Sound effects can also be outsourced.
* Programming is generally outsourced less than other disciplines, such as art or music. However, outsourcing for extra programming work or savings in salaries has become more common in recent years.

=== Ghost development ===
Outsourced work is sometimes anonymous, i.e. not credited on the final product. This might go against the wishes of the developer, or it is something they reluctantly consent to because it is the only work they can get. See for more information on this.

However, anonymity can also be agreed upon, or even desired by the outsourced party. A 2015 &quot;Polygon&quot; article stated that this practice is known as ghost development. Ghost developers are hired by other developers to provide assistance, by publishers to develop a title they designed, or by companies outside the gaming industry. These businesses prefer to keep this hidden from the public to protect their brand equity, not wanting consumers or investors to know that they rely on external help. Ghost development can involve (small) portions of a project, but there have been instances of entire games being outsourced without the studio being credited.

Ghost development has a particularly long history in the Japanese video game industry. Probably the best-known example is Tose. Founded in 1979, this &#x27;behind-the-scenes&#x27; agent has either developed or helped develop over 2,000 games as of 2017, most of them anonymously. This includes uncredited contributions to multiple &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles. Another example is Tokyo-based Hyde, which worked on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Persona&quot;, and &quot;Yakuza&quot; games. Its president, Kenichi Yanagihara, stated that the approach stems from Japanese culture, in which many people prefer not to seek the limelight.

== Marketing ==

The game production has similar distribution methods to those of music and film industries. 

The publisher&#x27;s marketing team targets the game for a specific market and then advertises it. The team advises the developer on target demographics and market trends, as well as suggests specific features. The game is then advertised and the game&#x27;s high concept is incorporated into the promotional material, ranging from magazine ads to TV spots. Communication between developer and marketing is important.

The length and purpose of a game demo depends on the purpose of the demo and target audience. A game&#x27;s demo may range between a few seconds (such as clips or screenshots) to hours of gameplay. The demo is usually intended for journalists, buyers, trade shows, general public, or internal employees (who, for example, may need to familiarize with the game to promote it). Demos are produced with public relations, marketing and sales in mind, maximizing the presentation effectiveness.

=== Trade show demo ===

As a game nears completion, the publisher will want to showcase a demo of the title at trade shows. Many games have a &quot;Trade Show demo&quot; scheduled.
The major annual trade shows are, for example, Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) or Penny Arcade Expo (PAX). E3 is the largest show in North America. E3 is hosted primarily for marketing and business deals. New games and platforms are announced at E3 and it received broad press coverage. Thousands of products are on display and press demonstration schedules are kept. In the 2000s E3 became a more closed-door event and many advertisers have withdrawn, reducing E3&#x27;s budget. PAX, created by authors of Penny Arcade blog and web-comic, is a mature and playful event with a player-centred philosophy.
=== Localization ===

A game created in one language may also be published in other countries which speak a different language. For that region, the developers may want to translate the game to make it more accessible. For example, some games created for PlayStation Vita were initially published in Japanese language, like &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;. Non-native speakers of the game&#x27;s original language may have to wait for the translation of the game to their language. But most modern big-budget games take localization into account during the development process and the games are released in several different languages simultaneously.

Localization is the process of translating the language assets in a game into other languages. By localizing games, they increase their level of accessibility where games could help to expend the international markets effectively. Game localization is generally known as language translations yet a &quot;full localization&quot; of a game is a complex project. Different levels of translation range from: zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw, to basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added, and full translation where new voiceovers and game material changes are added.

There are various essential elements in localizing a game including translating the language of the game to adjusting in-game assets for different cultures to reach more potential consumers in other geographies (or globalization for short). The translation seems to fall into the scope of localization, which itself constitutes a substantially broader endeavour. These include the different levels of translation to the globalization of the game itself. However, certain developers seem to be divided on whether globalization falls under localization or not.

Moreover, to fit into the local markets, game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes. For example, the popular game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; has two different packaging designs for the European and US markets. By localizing the graphics and packaging designs, companies might arouse better connections and attention from the consumers from various regions.

== Development costs ==

The costs of developing a video game varies widely depending on several factors including team size, game genre and scope, and other factors such as intellectual property licensing costs. Most video game consoles also require development licensing costs which include game development kits for building and testing software. Game budgets also typically include costs for marketing and promotion, which can be on the same order in cost as the development budget.

Prior to the 1990s, game development budgets, when reported, typically were on the average of , with known outliers, such as the that Atari had paid to license the rights for &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; in addition to development costs. The adoption of technologies such as 3D hardware rendering and CD-ROM integration by the mid-1990s, enabling games with more visual fidelity compared to prior titles, caused developers and publishers to put more money into game budgets as to flesh out narratives through cutscenes and full-motion video, and creating the start of the AAA video game industry. Some of the most expensive titles to develop around this time, approaching costs typical of major motion picture production budgets, included &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1997 with an estimated budget of , and &quot;Shenmue&quot; in 1999 with an estimated budget of .&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, with its marketing budget, had a total estimated cost of .

Raph Koster, a video game designer and economist, evaluated published development budgets (less any marketing) for over 250 games in 2017 and reported that since the mid-1990s, there has been a type of Moore&#x27;s Law in game budgets, with the average budget doubling about every five years after accounting for inflation. Koster reported average budgets were around by 2017, and could reach over by the early 2020s. Koster asserts these trends are partially tied to the technological Moore&#x27;s law that gave more computational power for developers to work into their games, but also related to expectations for content from players in newer games and the number of players games are expected to draw. Shawn Layden, former CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, affirmed that the costs for each generation of PlayStation consoles nearly doubled, with PlayStation 4 games have average budgets of and anticipating that PlayStation 5 games could reach . 

The rising costs of budgets of AAA games in the early 2000s led publishers to become risk-averse, staying to titles that were most likely to be high-selling games to recoup their costs. As a result of this risk aversion, the selection of AAA games in the mid-2000s became rather similar, and gave the opportunity for indie games that provided more experimental and unique gameplay concepts to expand around that time.

Costs of development for AAA games continued to rise over the next two decades; a report by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority regarding the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft in 2023. Costs slowing increased from 1–4 million in 2000, to over $5 million in 2006, then to over $20 million by 2010, followed by $50 million to $150 million by 2018, and $200 million and up by 2023. In some cases, several AAA games exceeded $1 billion to make, split between $500-$600M to develop and a similar amount for marketing. In court documents from regulatory review of the Activision Blizzard merger, reviewed by &quot;The Verge&quot;, the costs of Sony&#x27;s first party games like &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot; and &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; had exceeded $200 million.

== Indie development ==
Independent games or &quot;indie games&quot; are produced by individuals and small teams with no large-scale developer or publisher affiliations. Indie developers generally rely on Internet distribution schemes. Many hobbyist indie developers create mods of existing games. Indie developers are credited for creative game ideas (for example, &quot;Darwinia&quot;, &quot;Weird Worlds&quot;, &quot;World of Goo&quot;). Current economic viability of indie development is questionable, however in recent years internet delivery platforms, such as, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam have improved indie game success. In fact, some indie games have become very successful, such as &quot;Braid&quot;, &quot;World of Goo&quot;, and &quot;Minecraft&quot;. In recent years many communities have emerged in support of indie games such as the popular indie game marketplace Itch.io, indie game YouTube channels and a large indie community on Steam. It is common for indie game developers to release games for free and generate revenue through other means such as microtransactions (in-game transactions), in-game advertisements and crowd-funding services like Patreon and Kickstarter.

== Game industry ==

The video game industry (formally referred to as interactive entertainment) is the economic sector involved with the development, marketing and sale of video games. The industry sports several unique approaches.

=== Locales ===

==== United States ====
In the United States, in the early history of video game development, the prominent locale for game development was the corridor from San Francisco to Silicon Valley in California. Most new developers in the US open near such &quot;hot beds&quot;.

At present, many large publishers still operate there, such as: Activision Blizzard, Capcom Entertainment, Crystal Dynamics, Electronic Arts, Namco Bandai Games, Sega of America, and Sony Computer Entertainment America. However, due to the nature of game development, many publishers are present in other regions, such as Big Fish Games (Washington), Majesco Entertainment (New Jersey), Microsoft Corporation (Washington), Nintendo of America (Washington), and Take-Two Interactive (New York),

=== Education ===

Many universities and design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development. Some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies. These alliances ensure that students have access to the latest technologies and are provided the opportunity to find jobs within the gaming industry once qualified. Many innovative ideas are presented at conferences, such as Independent Games Festival (IGF) or Game Developers Conference (GDC).

Indie game development may motivate students who produce a game for their final projects or thesis and may open their own game company.

=== Stability ===
Video game industry employment is fairly volatile, similar to other artistic industries including television, music, etc. Scores of game development studios crop up, work on one game, and then quickly go under. This may be one reason why game developers tend to congregate geographically; if their current studio goes under, developers can flock to an adjacent one or start another from the ground up.

In an industry where only the top 20% of products make a profit, it is easy to understand this fluctuation. Numerous games may start development and are cancelled, or perhaps even completed but never published. Experienced game developers may work for years and yet never ship a title: such is the nature of the business.

<doc id="700270" wikidata="Q17006510" url="?curid=700270" title="Steve Dallas">
<text>Steve Dallas is a fictional character in the American comic strips of Berke Breathed, most famously &quot;Bloom County&quot; in the 1980s.

He was first introduced as an obnoxious frat boy in the college strip &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;, which ran in the University of Texas&#x27;s &quot;Daily Texan&quot; during 1978 and 1979. Steve then reappears in &quot;Bloom County&quot; after graduation as a self-employed, unscrupulous lawyer.

He was the first character to have been featured in all four of Breathed&#x27;s comic strips. He appeared regularly, albeit much older, in the Sunday-only &quot;Opus&quot;.

On June 12, 2013, Steve Dallas made a guest appearance in &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot;.

== In &quot;Bloom County&quot;==

In the early days of &quot;Bloom County&quot;, Steve was usually seen hitting on schoolteacher Bobbi Harlow, whom he briefly dated and failed to woo back once she left him for Cutter John. He frequently dated Bobbi&#x27;s dimwitted cousin, Quiche Loraine, to make her jealous (the plan did not work).

Most residents of Bloom County, especially women, either despised him or indifferently tolerated his presence. The one exception was Opus the Penguin, who idolized him and tagged along with him like a younger brother. Steve often used Opus&#x27; hero worship to manipulate the hapless penguin into doing his dirty work (although occasionally Steve was heard to have threatened Opus into helping him instead).

He was often shown to hold strongly conservative political positions (albeit to a lesser extent than in &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;), to the extent that the Reagan White House&#x27;s policies were only sometimes enough to satisfy him. (He remarked early in the President&#x27;s tenure that he thought &quot;Haig and the generals should run Reagan and his liberal pack right out of the White House.&quot;) However, both he and the other (mostly liberal) characters became less hostile to Reagan&#x27;s policies as both the strip&#x27;s run and Reagan&#x27;s tenure ran on. In another strip, a flashback of Dallas&#x27;s teenage years showed him reading conservative author William F. Buckley&#x27;s book &quot;God and Man at Yale&quot;.

Dallas did not, however, seem to hold the traditionalist religious moral principles that were associated with Reagan and his allies on the right at the time, as his womanizing and lack of religious practice would indicate. He once went so far as to say that, &quot;My God. We&#x27;ve got to get Carter back in the White House&quot; after associating Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency with the end of the Sexual revolution and therefore the end of his conquests at &quot;Bob&#x27;s Bar &amp; Flesh Market&quot;. Like most conservatives (and liberals, and others) portrayed in Breathed&#x27;s work, Steve&#x27;s political positions do not appear to stem from actual convictions.

As a lawyer, Steve took on hopeless cases defending psychotic and obviously guilty criminals and murderers, much to the chagrin of his overbearing mother. On one occasion, he &quot;did&quot; win a case (his client had allegedly murdered her husband with an axe), but only because the jury cared more about what the woman wore than whether or not she was innocent (at one point, she found a plastic picnic knife and supposedly tried to make a fillet out of a CNN cameraman). A bachelor throughout the entire run of the strip, he was the most aggressive womanizer and most blatant male chauvinist of all the eligible males in the cartoon.

Outside of the courts, Steve&#x27;s professionalism was questionable. In one instance he attempts to collect from a past due client by saying &quot;Attention criminal pervert, where the hell is my dough, you twisted goon?&quot;. Opus, however, who at the time is working as a paralegal, writes in the actual letter &quot;We still await payment of your legal fee&quot;.

He was briefly the manager of Billy and the Boingers, a Def Leppard-esque glam metal band consisting of Opus, Bill the Cat, and Hodge-Podge.

Steve briefly became a different person shortly after he was abducted by aliens. On board their spaceship, the aliens had originally planned to transplant Elvis Presley&#x27;s brain into Steve&#x27;s head. However, after Steve threatened the aliens with a lawsuit, they decided to perform the &quot;Gephardtization&quot; process on him instead, which was the same procedure used previously on then-U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt to completely reverse opinions and attitudes. After being presumed dead by the residents of Bloom County, Steve was zapped back to earth a few days later. To the whole county&#x27;s amazement, he was now a sensitive, caring liberal and feminist. He stopped wearing his trademark sunglasses, quit smoking, got a perm (thinking it made him look like Alan Alda), and canvassed for Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1988 Presidential campaign.

This carried on for about a year, until Steve found out that his girlfriend Gladys was cheating on him with the bassist for &quot;Guns &#x27;n Spittle&quot; and Opus had been using his toothbrush to comb his nose hair. Devastated, he resolved to forever avenge feminine betrayal, and by doing so, he put his trademark sunglasses back on. He immediately returned to his old, cantankerous self.

During the closing down of &quot;Bloom County&quot; in the final days of the strip, Steve seeks employment in other strips. He is seen (in the strip) to land a guest spot in &quot;Cathy&quot;, much to the title character&#x27;s horror. (Many years later, in the revived Bloom County, the Cathy character slept with Steve Dallas, and regretted it in the morning.)

In the 21st century reboot of Bloom County Steve remains a major character.

==&quot;Outland&quot; and &quot;Opus&quot;==

At the end of &quot;Outland&quot; in 1995, Steve came out of the closet and admitted he was gay. In his final appearance in the comic, he had married a man (&quot;Doonesbury&#x27;s&quot; Mark Slackmeyer) and was thinking about adopting children.

However, in &quot;Opus&quot; nine years later, Steve was back to his babe-mongering ways after enrolling in the &quot;Rev. Doogle De-Poofta&quot; which used shock therapy to attempt to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuality; in a form of conversion therapy. Steve was depicted as a middle-aged man with thinning hair and a noticeable paunch.

Steve was also reunited with his long-lost son Augie (presumably named after Augie Doggie), and reluctantly took on the role of father figure. The August 26, 2007 strip implied that he was romantically involved with the recently re-introduced character Lola Granola, a former love interest of Opus.

== The &quot;real&quot; Steve Dallas==
Breathed has stated that Dallas was based on a real person.

Steve Dallas...a frat-boy lawyer who I knew in school. He&#x27;s never written me. I suspect he was shot by an annoyed girlfriend, which saved me many legal fees

The name &quot;Steve Dallas&quot; also appears in the classic and cynical noir film &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, wherein a cool jazz musician named Steve Dallas dates the wrong girl (kid sister of a sinister and influential columnist played by Burt Lancaster) and gets set up for a drug bust as a result.

In the 2013 movie &quot;Are You Here&quot;, Owen Wilson plays &#x27;Steve Dallas&#x27;, an inveterate womanizer. In one scene, Dallas is slumped in a recliner wearing sunglasses just as his Bloom County namesake often does.

<doc id="700275" wikidata="Q332640" url="?curid=700275" title="Luca Cordero di Montezemolo">
<text>Luca Cordero di Montezemolo (; born 31 August 1947) is an Italian businessman who is best known as former chairman of Ferrari, and formerly Chairman of Fiat S.p.A. and President of Confindustria and FIEG. 

Montezemolo comes from an aristocratic family from the region of Piedmont in Italy. He is one of the founders and former president of NTV, an Italian company which is Europe&#x27;s first private open access operator of 300 km/h (186 mph) high-speed trains.

In 2009, Montezemolo founded Future Italy, a free market think tank that joined Civic Choice in the 2013 Italian parliamentary election.

==Ancestry and family background==
Born in Bologna, Italy, he is the youngest son of Massimo Cordero dei Marchesi di Montezemolo (1920–2009), a Piedmontese aristocrat whose family served the Royal House of Savoy for generations, and Clotilde Neri (1922–2017), niece of famed Italian surgeon Vincenzo Neri. His uncle, Admiral Giorgio Cordero dei Marchesi di Montezemolo (1918–1986) was a commander in the Regia Marina in World War II. His grandfather, Mario (1888–1960) and great-grandfather Carlo (1858–1943) were both Generals in the Italian Army. He is also a relation to Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (his father Massimo and Andrea were cousins), who became a cardinal in 2006 and whose father, colonel Giuseppe Cordero di Montezemolo, was killed by the Nazi occupation troops during the massacre of the Fosse Ardeatine in Rome in 1944. His surname is actually &quot;Cordero di Montezemolo&quot; and the correct usage is either the full surname or just Montezemolo (omitting the &quot;di&quot;); Marchesi is a noble title.

==Early life and education==
Montezemolo graduated with a degree in law from La Sapienza University in 1971. Afterwards, he studied for a master&#x27;s degree in international commercial law at Columbia University.

==Career==
===Sports===
Montezemolo&#x27;s sporting career began at the wheel of a Giannini Fiat 500 which he raced together with his friend Cristiano Rattazzi. Later, Montezemolo briefly drove for the privately owned Lancia rally team known as HF Squadra Corse. He joined the auto manufacturing conglomerate FIAT S.p.A., headquartered in Torino. In 1973 was moved to Ferrari, where he became Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s assistant and, in 1974, manager of the Scuderia. During his involvement with the team, Ferrari won the Formula One World Championship with Niki Lauda in 1975 and 1977.

===Business===
In 1976 Montezemolo was promoted to become head of all FIAT racing activities, and in 1977 he advanced to become a senior manager of FIAT. Throughout the 1980s, Montezemolo occupied a number of positions in the FIAT empire, including managing director of the drinks company Cinzano and director of the publishing company Itedi. 

In 1982, Montezemolo managed the America&#x27;s Cup challenge of Team Azzurra, the first Italian yacht club to enter the event. In 1985, he became manager of the Organizing Committee for 1990 World Cup Italia.

In November 1991, FIAT Chairman Gianni Agnelli appointed Montezemolo president of Ferrari, which had been struggling since Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s death. Montezemolo made it his personal goal to win the Formula One World Constructors&#x27; Championship once again. Montezemolo quickly made changes at the Italian team, signing up Niki Lauda as a consultant and promoting Claudio Lombardi to the team manager role. During the 1990s he resurrected the Ferrari road car business from heavy debts into profit. He also took on the presidency of Maserati when Ferrari acquired it in 1997, until 2005.

Under Montezemolo and executive director Jean Todt, the Ferrari Formula One team won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in 2000, the first time since 1979. The previous year, 1999, they had won the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the first time since 1983.
On 27 May 2004, Montezemolo became president of the Italian business lobby Confindustria. Days later, following the death of Umberto Agnelli on 28 May, he was elected chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Ferrari&#x27;s parent company. 

Montezemolo has often been reported to have aspirations of a career in Italian politics, most recently the office of prime minister, but has always denied the rumours.

On 29 July 2008, Montezemolo founded the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) which he presided over from 2008 to 2010, eventually being replaced by McLaren CEO Martin Whitmarsh. The Committee used to meet on a regular basis to discuss improvements to Formula One. FOTA was formally dissolved in 2014.

Montezemolo&#x27;s salary in 2010 was more than twice that of Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne, making him the best-paid executive in the Fiat Group.

In April 2010, John Elkann replaced Montezemolo as Chairman of Fiat S.p.A.

On 10 September 2014, Montezemolo resigned as president and chairman of Ferrari following increasing tension with his would-be successor, FIAT Chrysler CEO, Sergio Marchionne.

In February 2015, Montezemolo became committee president of the Rome bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

In April 2016, Montezemolo&#x27;s name was mentioned in the Panama Papers.

==Recognition==

== Personal life ==
Montezemolo lives primarily in Italy, with an apartment in Rome and a country estate outside Bologna.

He has five children, and has been married twice.

In 2012 Montezemolo was issued a suspended sentence of one year imprisonment by the court in Naples for the unauthorized construction of his personal residence in Anacapri, Italy.

In his spare time, Montezemolo is a keen sailor and has owned two motor yachts.

<text>The Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank (NIHB, ) was a Dutch bank established in 1863 to finance trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. During most of the colonial period, it was the second-largest of the “big three” commercial banks, behind the Netherlands Trading Company and ahead of the Nederlandsch-Indische Escompto Maatschappij, that dominated the Dutch East Indies’ financial system alongside the note-issuing Bank of Java. 

In 1950 following Indonesian independence, the bank was renamed the Nationale Handelsbank (NHB, ). In 1959, its Indonesian activities were nationalized, and later contributed to the formation of the state-owned Bank Mandiri in 1998. In 1960, the NHB&#x27;s remaining activities were acquired by the Rotterdamsche Bank, and were subsequently involved in the series of mergers that created ABN AMRO.

==Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank==

In 1863, the Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank was established in order to finance and deal with trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. The bank&#x27;s head office was located in Amsterdam, unlike the Bank of Java whose head office was in Batavia. In turn, the NIHB&#x27;s local branches within the Dutch colony reported to the main office in Batavia.

Between 1901 and 1950, Netherlands India Commercial Bank opened and closed various branches in third countries. In 1901 it opened a branch in Singapore, which played a key role in Dutch East Indies trade. The bank also established a branch in Hong Kong in 1906, which before World War I was a major transshipment point for raw sugar going from the Dutch East Indies to refineries in Britain. In 1920 the bank opened branches in Bombay, Calcutta, Shanghai, and Kobe to aid in cotton trading with Japan. From 1921 to 1923 branches were opened in the Japanese prefectures of Tokyo and Yokohama. Additional branches were also opened in the Chinese provinces of Amoy and Swatow. Although, in 1924 the branch in Yokohama closed after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and the Chinese branch in Swatow closed after operating for only a few years. The bank continued expanding in the 1930 and 1940s though. In 1938 a new branch was opened in Manila and in 1948 it established a branch in Bangkok to aid with the rice, tea, shellac trades. After 1949 the branches in China closed after the defeat of the Kuomintang government.

Under the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during World War II, the occupation authorities first closed all Dutch and other Western banks in March 1942, starting with the Bank of Java, and sequestered them to seize as much as possible of their assets. Among the three largest commercial banks, the Japanese authorities determined that the Netherlands Trading Company had assets of more than 280 million Dutch guilders, the NIHB had 158 million, and the Nederlandsch-Indische Escompto Maatschappij had 99 million. Of these, the Japanese occupiers were able to seize 27 million guilders in total. The banks could only reopen after the surrender of Japan in the late summer of 1945. 

==Nationale Handelsbank==

In 1950, the bank&#x27;s name was changed to Nationale Handelsbank (NHB). It closed the branch in Manila, which had enjoyed a brief boom after World War II but now was no longer promising. In 1952 the branch in Kobe was still functioning, but it closed sometime thereafter. By 1953, the NHB had branches throughout Indonesia in Java (Bandoeng, Banjoewangi*, Gambir (Weltevreden), Malang, Probolinggo, Samarang, Soerabaja, Tegal*, and Tjirebon*), Soematra (Djambi, Medan, Palembang, Telok-Betoeng), Bandjarmasin, Pontianak, and Macassar. The branches marked with * dealt with warehousing and shipping matters. Prior to the Japanese invasion in 1942, the bank had also maintained branches at Pasoeroean, Tjilatjap, Pekalongan, Menado, Tandjoengbalai, and Gorontalo. Also in 1953, the NHB established Mercantile Bank of Canada, with offices in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

In 1959, the Indonesian government nationalized the bank&#x27;s operations in the country to create Bank Umum Negara, one of the predecessors of Bank Mandiri. This deprived the NHB of much of its operations. The next year, the Rotterdamsche Bank acquired the NHB, and in 1962 it sold its branches in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo to Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1963, it also sold 50% of Mercantile Bank to Citibank, and the other 50% in 1965 - giving rise to the “Mercantile Bank Affair”. Also in 1965, Nationale Handelsbank again changed its name to Nationale Bank voor Middellang Krediet (NBMK, ). AMRO Bank, which had been formed in the meantime by the merger of Rotterdamsche Bank with Amsterdamsche Bank in 1964, fully absorbed NBMK in 1967.

<text>Weehawken Cove is a cove on the west bank of the Hudson River between the New Jersey municipalities of Hoboken to the south and Weehawken to the north. At the perimeter of the cove are completed sections the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, offering views of Manhattan and the Palisades. The name Weehawken comes from the Lenape, and can translate as &quot;at the end of&quot;, either the Hudson Palisades or the stream which flowed from them into the cove, later the site of the nearby Lincoln Tunnel.

==Half Moon==
The first European to record visiting the cove was Robert Juet, first mate of the Half Moon captained by Henry Hudson, who anchored his ship in the cove on October 2, 1609.

He wrote: &quot;We got down two leagues beyond that place and anchored in a bay clear from all danger of them on the other side of the river, where we saw a good piece of ground, and hard by it there was a cliff that looked of the colour of white-green, as though it was either a copper or silver mine, and I think it to be one of them by the 
trees that grow upon it, for they are all burned, and the other places are green as grass.&quot; The cliff described is now known as Castle Point.

==Lipton Tea and Lincoln Harbor==

A prominent landmark on the south side of the cove is the Hudson Tea Buildings, a converted residential complex in former plant and warehouse of Lipton Tea. Additional apartment complexes have been built along the cove in the last decade. The cove is two blocks north of 14th Street. On the north of the Cove is Lincoln Harbor, a residential, commercial, and recreational area on the site of the former Erie Railroad Weehawken Yard, which had partially filled the cove to be built.

Proposals to build residential buildings along the southern perimeter of the cove have been met with local opposition, including city officials in Hoboken, who contend the waterfront area is better used for public open space.

A proposal to build two 18-story buildings at the northwest corner of the cove were rejected by Weehawken.

==Hudson River Waterfront Walkway==

In September 2010 county officials announced construction of an 800 foot section of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway (HRWW) along the western perimeter of the cove, adjacent to the proposed Hoboken Cove Park. The walkway, which connects Weehawken and Hoboken, was completed in April 2012.

<text>William Medill (February 1802September 2, 1865) was a 19th-century American lawyer and Democratic politician from Ohio. He was the 22nd governor of Ohio from 1853 to 1856. He had previously served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1839 to 1843.

==Biography==
Born in White Clay Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware, William was the son of Irish immigrants, William and Isabelle Medill. He grew up on the family farm, in the rural outskirts of Newark. He attended the Newark Academy and graduated in 1825. After graduation, he read law and was admitted to the bar in Delaware in 1830. Medill moved to Ohio in 1830 and was admitted to the bar in Ohio in 1832.

==Career==
Medill was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1835 to 1838, serving as speaker of the House from 1836 to 1837. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1838, serving from 1839 to 1843. He lost a bid for a third term in 1842. After briefly serving as the second assistant postmaster general, Medill was appointed by President Polk as commissioner of Indian Affairs. He returned to Ohio in 1850 to serve as the president of the 1850–1851 Constitutional Convention. Elected to the new post of lieutenant governor of Ohio in 1851, Medill entered office in 1852, serving until the resignation of Governor Reuben Wood on July 13, 1853 to take up a Consular office in Chile. Medill was re-elected in his own right in 1853, but was defeated in a bid for a second full term in 1855 by the anti-slavery Salmon P. Chase. He was First Comptroller of the United States Treasury from 1857 to 1861.

==Death==
Medill died in Lancaster in 1865, and was interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Lancaster, Ohio. Medill never married. A nephew inherited his property.

<doc id="700306" wikidata="Q7712170" url="?curid=700306" title="The Academia Waltz">
<text>The Academia Waltz was Berkeley Breathed&#x27;s first comic strip, published daily from 1978 to 1979 in &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; at The University of Texas at Austin, where he was a student. The strip focused primarily on college life, although it sometimes made references to big news stories of the time (such as the Three Mile Island accident in 1979).

==Characters==
*Steve Dallas: an arrogant, obnoxious fraternity member preoccupied with the pursuit of sex. He became an icon in many circles at the University of Texas, which was not Breathed&#x27;s intent.
*Kitzi: Steve&#x27;s sorority girlfriend. She often finds ways to bend Steve to her will, a fact not always clear to Steve. She and Steve were married in the comic&#x27;s penultimate strip.
*Rabies: Steve&#x27;s reluctant canine friend.
*Saigon John: a wheelchair-using Vietnam War veteran who frequently attends protest marches. He does not often see &quot;eye to eye&quot; with the conservative Steve.
*Val Blain: Kitzi&#x27;s lovelorn best friend.

Two of the characters from &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot; would be resurrected for Breathed&#x27;s next strip, &quot;Bloom County&quot;: Steve Dallas and Saigon John (renamed &quot;Cutter John&quot;). Rabies also became a character early on in the strip, but disappeared around the time that Opus the Penguin (who would later become Breathed&#x27;s most popular character) appeared; Breathed cites one reason for Rabies being &quot;retired&quot; is that there was &quot;no shortage of cartoon dogs&quot;.

Kitzi later made a guest appearance in &quot;Bloom County&quot; in 1985, although the character had been altered to be Steve&#x27;s younger sister rather than his girlfriend (jailed for protesting Apartheid, even though their sorority doesn&#x27;t even admit blacks).

==Collections==
Two collections featuring the comic were published. They are currently out of print and extremely rare, or as Breathed&#x27;s website claims, &quot;eBay is your only hope.&quot;
*&quot;The Academia Waltz&quot; (1979)
*&quot;The Academia Waltz: Bowing Out&quot; (1980)
A few &quot;Academia Waltz&quot; comics were also reprinted in the &quot;Bloom County&quot; collection &quot;Classics of Western Literature&quot; (1990), as well as in &quot;Bloom County: The Complete Library: Volume One: 1980–1982&quot; (2009).

In August 2015, IDW Publishing released an anthology titled &quot;Berkeley Breathed’s Academia Waltz &amp; Other Profound Transgressions.&quot; The anthology collects work from Breathed&#x27;s college days, publishing his strips from &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, his college newspaper from 1978 to 1979, along with scanned original art from his personal archives featuring &quot;Academia Waltz&quot; strips (with author&#x27;s margin notes) and political cartoons.

<text>Arctic Circle Restaurants is an American chain of burger and shake restaurants based in Midvale, Utah, United States.

==Description==
 there were 71 restaurants in seven states, about half are company-owned and the rest are owned by franchisees and about half of the restaurants are in Utah. They serve typical fast food such as burgers, sandwiches, shakes, salads, fries and fish and chips.

The company claims to have invented the regional condiment fry sauce, and that it was the first burger chain to invent and sell the kids&#x27; meal.

==Origins==
In 1924, Don Carlos Edwards established a small refreshment stand at a Pioneer Day celebration. By 1941 it had grown into a thriving BBQ restaurant. Edwards subsequently opened the first Arctic Circle restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1950. Shortly after opening Arctic Circle, Edwards introduced “pink sauce,”, a thousand island dressing-like combination of mayonnaise and ketchup. This later became known as “fry sauce.”

<text>Ashley Nicolle Ross-Næss ( Simpson; born October 3, 1984), known professionally as Ashlee Simpson, is an American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. The younger sister of singer and actress Jessica Simpson, she began her career as a back-up dancer for her sister and appeared in television commercials at the age of 15. Simpson later pursued a career as an actress and had a main role on the family drama &quot;7th Heaven.&quot; She appeared on the reality show &quot;&quot;, broadcast on MTV between 2003 and 2005, which focused on Ashlee&#x27;s older sister Jessica and Jessica&#x27;s then-husband Nick Lachey. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of a spin-off reality series, &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;, which was broadcast on MTV between 2004 and 2005. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention.

Her breakout came with her debut single, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, which was released in 2004, reached the top five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, &quot;Autobiography,&quot; also released in 2004, to the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film &quot;Undiscovered&quot; (2005), which was critically and commercially unsuccessful. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to media scrutiny. Simpson&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;I Am Me&quot; (2005), debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Following her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of &quot;Chicago,&quot; Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album. The album differed from the pop-rock sound of her previous efforts, featuring a dance-pop and 1980s-themed sound. &quot;Bittersweet World&quot; was released in 2008 to positive critical reception. It saw a decline in sales, and reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; revamp, which was met with harsh critical reception. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut reprising her role as Roxie Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot; on Broadway.

Simpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single &quot;Bat for a Heart&quot; (2012), which failed to garner success. Simpson eventually scrapped the album and focused on raising her child. Simpson reprised her role as Roxie Hart for the third time in a 2-dates special production in Hollywood Bowl in July 2013 directed by Brooke Shields. In October 2018, Simpson and her husband Evan Ross released their debut extended play (EP) by Ashlee + Evan through Access Records, which was supported by a tour in select cities across North America, and their TV reality show &quot;Ashlee + Evan&quot;.

==Life and career==

===1984–2002: Early life and career beginnings===
Born as Ashley Nicolle in Waco, Texas in 1984, Simpson&#x27;s parents are Tina and Joe Simpson. She has one older sister, Jessica Simpson. Both she and Jessica attended Prairie Creek Elementary and North Junior High, located in Richardson, Texas, where the girls were raised. When she was three years old, she began studying classical ballet. She enrolled at the School of American Ballet in New York City when she was eleven, becoming the youngest person ever to be admitted into the school. Though the age requirement for the school was twelve, Simpson&#x27;s father admitted to lying about her age. During this time, Simpson suffered from an unnamed eating disorder for about six months, eventually receiving treatment from her parents. The Simpson family relocated to Los Angeles, California, in 1999, as Jessica pursued a singing career. While Jessica launched her career, Ashlee began appearing in television commercials. Her father, Joe, served as her agent.

Following the commercial success of Jessica&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; (1999), Ashlee became one of her back-up dancers on tour. Hoping to pursue a career in acting, Simpson had a minor guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. The following year, Simpson had a small role as Monique in the Rob Schneider comedy film &quot;The Hot Chick&quot; (2002). She joined the seventh season of the family drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot; as Cecilia Smith, a role which she continued to portray in the eighth season. Simpson appeared in a total of forty episodes as Cecilia. That same year, Ashlee recorded a song titled &quot;Christmas Past, Present, and Future&quot; for the holiday album &quot;School&#x27;s Out! Christmas&quot;; the song was later re-released on &quot;Radio Disney Jingle Jams&quot; following Simpson&#x27;s musical breakthrough. She later recorded the song &quot;Just Let Me Cry&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003). Simpson later began writing and recording demos, in hopes of finding a record label. It was confirmed a month after the release of the &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; soundtrack that Simpson had signed with Geffen Records to release her debut studio album.

===2003–2004: Breakthrough, &quot;Autobiography&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; incident===
It was announced that Jessica Simpson and then-husband Nick Lachey would star in their own MTV reality series, &quot;&quot;. The series, which chronicled Simpson and Lachey&#x27;s life as a married couple, became a pop culture phenomenon and helped draw attention to the Simpson sisters. Ashlee was a VJ on &quot;TRL&quot; on MTV in the United States during the summer of 2003. Following the success of the series, it was confirmed that Simpson would receive her own series, &quot;The Ashlee Simpson Show&quot;. Hoping to end comparisons between her and her sister, Ashlee wanted the series to focus on the recording of her debut album. During this time, Simpson also dyed her naturally blonde hair brown, a decision that received media attention. While filming the show, Simpson appeared in the music video for musician Ryan Cabrera&#x27;s debut single &quot;On the Way Down&quot; (2004), portraying herself as Cabrera&#x27;s love interest. The couple later began a romantic relationship, with Cabrera inspiring multiple songs for Simpson&#x27;s album.
Simpson wanted her debut album to consist of pop-rock music, as she did not listen to pop music. The project was produced by John Shanks, while Simpson co-wrote all of the songs on the album. She also worked with songwriter Kara DioGuardi on the album, with DioGuardi receiving credits on seven of the album&#x27;s tracks. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, became a hit in the United States. The song reached the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on pop radio airplay. &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting 500,000 copies of the single being sold. Her debut album, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, was released on July 20, 2004, to a generally mixed critical reception. The album debuted at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart in the United States, selling an estimated 398,000 copies in its first week of release. It was the highest-selling debut album by a female artist that year, going on to sell over 2.5 million copies in the United States by January 2005. The success of the album and its lead single was attributed to the exposure from her reality television series. The album sold over five million copies worldwide.

On October 23, 2004, Simpson appeared as a musical guest on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to promote the album. After suffering from what Simpson said was vocal cord inflammation caused by acid reflux on the day of the live broadcast, she lost her voice and was unable to complete the final rehearsals. She decided to use a pre-recorded vocal track as support in the two scheduled performances for the evening.

Her first performance, &quot;Pieces of Me,&quot; went smoothly. However, when the band prepared to play the second song, the title track &quot;Autobiography&quot;, an incorrectly played vocal track from the previously performed song was mistakenly triggered before Simpson reached the microphone. The vocal track was promptly lowered, but in the meantime, the band also synchronized with the notes of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot; to mitigate the error, causing even more confusion. Simpson initially reacted with a brief jig, but after about 30 seconds she left the stage. Her band continued playing, prompting the production to initiate a commercial break. Later, Simpson reappeared during the closing credits with the evening&#x27;s host, Jude Law, saying: &quot;My band started playing the wrong song, and I didn&#x27;t know what to do, so I thought I&#x27;d do a hoedown. I&#x27;m sorry. This is live TV. These things happen!&quot;

The incident triggered a strong backlash from the audience and media, and Simpson was accused of lip-syncing. Days later, Simpson called music video series Total Request Live and said that she had almost completely lost her voice. Her drummer had accidentally pressed the wrong button, playing the incorrect track and causing the technical error.

A &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, recorded behind the scenes on the same night as the incident and broadcast the following week, supported Simpson&#x27;s account, showing her suffering voice loss during the dress rehearsals, and eventually leaving the studio in tears. However, Simpson continued to face criticism. &quot;SNL&#x27;s&quot; producer Lorne Michaels stated that he was unaware of the plans of using lip-synching and that if he had known, he would never have allowed it. He also said that Simpson was the only musical guest ever to have walked off stage during a live performance. Simpson said of the incident, &quot;I made a complete fool of myself.&quot;

Despite the negative media attention surrounding the incident, Simpson released &quot;Shadow&quot; as the second single from &quot;Autobiography&quot; in the United States. The song did not receive a release in European territories. It failed to have the success of its predecessor, though it did reach the top twenty of the Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming her second hit on the chart. The song lyrically spoke of her views towards her older sister&#x27;s success. The song received a positive critical reception, with some praising it as a highlight for the album. &quot;La La&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third and final single in January 2005, and again failed to match the success of &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;. Despite a low peak on the Hot 100 chart, the song received a gold certification from the RIAA. The song served as only the second single in European territories. Simpson and Cabrera ended their relationship, though the two remained friends. At the &quot;Teen Choice Awards&quot; on August 8, 2004, Simpson received the &quot;Song of the Summer&quot; Teen Choice Award for &quot;Pieces of Me&quot;, as well as the &quot;Fresh Face&quot; Award. She also won the Billboard Award for New Female Artist of the Year in December, and in the same month, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named her one of its Breakout Stars of 2004.

===2005–2007: &quot;I Am Me&quot;, media scrutiny, and Broadway===
In January 2005, gossip news outlets began speculating that Simpson and actor Wilmer Valderrama were romantically involved, leading to rumors of a &quot;love triangle&quot; between the pair and Valderrama&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Lindsay Lohan. Despite this, representatives for Simpson claimed that the two had been friends for years, and there was no romantic interest. Simpson appeared as a musical guest during halftime at the 2005 Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. Her performance of &quot;La La&quot; garnered a negative reception from the crowd, leading to boos. In February 2005, Simpson embarked on her Autobiography Tour throughout North America. Featuring a total of thirty-seven shows, the tour saw Simpson performing songs from her debut album, as well as covers and a previously unreleased song. While on tour, Simpson wrote material for her second studio album. Simpson had a supporting role in the film &quot;Undiscovered&quot;, portraying an aspiring actress named Clea, but the film was a critical and commercial failure, and it earned Simpson a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards.

Simpson released her second studio album, &quot;I Am Me&quot;, in October 2005. The album featured similar pop-rock themes as found on her debut effort, though Simpson hoped to incorporate the feel of music from the 1980s into her sound. Much like her previous release, Simpson co-wrote all of the songs on the album. It became her second album to debut at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 220,000 copies in the United States. The album failed to match the success of &quot;Autobiography,&quot; though it went on to sell over three million copies worldwide. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Boyfriend&quot;, was written and composed about the rumors between Simpson and Valderama, and it became her second top-twenty hit in the United States. For the release of the album, Simpson went back to her blonde hair. The album&#x27;s second and final single, &quot;L.O.V.E.&quot;, entered the top forty in the United States. Simpson appeared for a second time as a musical performer on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; performing the song &quot;Catch Me When I Fall&quot;, which was inspired by her previous appearance on the series, as well as &quot;Boyfriend&quot;. This time, both songs were performed without any adverse incident. In mid-December, Simpson collapsed after performing in Japan and was briefly hospitalized, consequently canceling an appearance at the Radio Music Awards. The collapse and her subsequent hospitalization were attributed to exhaustion as a result of her busy work schedule.

Simpson embarked on her I Am Me Tour in the final months of 2005 and began dating her drummer Braxton Olita. In March 2006, Simpson won an MTV celebrity surfing invitational competition, which also featured celebrities such as Meagan Good, Jack Osbourne, Ashley Parker Angel, and Tony Hawk. On April 12, 2006, she hosted and performed at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards, where she won &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; for the single &quot;Boyfriend&quot;. Simpson had a nose job in April 2006. In the May 2007 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, she said that she was neither insecure about her appearance nor had been so beforehand. She said that plastic surgery was a &quot;personal choice&quot; that one should only decide to do for oneself and not for others. In a September 2007 interview, her father, Joe Simpson, explained of the surgery Ashlee had undergone: &quot;There was a real problem with her breathing and that was cured.&quot; In the middle of 2006, Simpson gave an interview to &quot;Marie Claire&quot; magazine, in which she was said to have &quot;had it with Hollywood&#x27;s twisted view of feminine beauty&quot; and was photographed painting a pro-female mural with a group of underprivileged girls from Los Angeles&#x27; Green Dot Public School. By the time the magazine hit newsstands, Simpson had already had her nose job, and some &quot;Marie Claire&quot; readers complained that this was hypocritical. The magazine received over 1,000 letters of complaint and the magazine&#x27;s new editor expanded the letters section of the September issue of the magazine to give readers a chance to vent their frustrations.

Simpson embarked on her third North American tour, the L.O.V.E. Tour, to further promote her sophomore album. It was announced that &quot;I Am Me&quot; would be re-released in the following months featuring a new single &quot;Invisible&quot;, a cover of a Jaded Era song. The single was released in June 2006 and went on to peak at number 21 on the Hot 100. It became her second single to enter the top ten of the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on pop radio airplay. Eventually, it was confirmed that a re-release of &quot;I Am Me&quot; had been scrapped. In 2006, Simpson was cast as Roxie Hart in the West End musical production of &quot;Chicago&quot; from September 25 to October 28, 2006. She received mostly positive reviews. Her performance in the show was described as &quot;dazzling and near flawless&quot;. Following her split with Olita, it was confirmed that Simpson was in a relationship with Fall Out Boy band member Pete Wentz.

===2007–2011: &quot;Bittersweet World&quot;, motherhood, marriage and return to Broadway===

Following her appearance as Roxie Hart, Simpson confirmed that she had begun working on her third studio album, initially slated for release in late 2007. Geffen Records chairman Ron Fair said in December 2006 that working on Simpson&#x27;s next album would be &quot;very tricky&quot; because of press scrutiny and &quot;prejudices&quot;, but that Geffen would work with her to overcome that, &quot;because she deserves to be heard and she deserves a shot.&quot; Hoping to transition to a new sound, Simpson enlisted producers Timbaland and The Neptunes to provide &quot;beat-oriented&quot; songs for the project. Simpson released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)&quot;, in December 2007. The song featured elements of synthpop and was heavily influenced by the pop-music scene of the 1980s. The single failed to chart on the Hot 100 chart in the United States, though it had moderate success in international territories. &quot;Bittersweet World&quot;, Simpson&#x27;s third studio album, was released on April 19, 2008. The album saw a decline for Simpson, debuting at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 47,000 copies. Simpson launched a collection of tops in partnership with the clothing retailer Wet Seal on April 22, 2008, the same day &quot;Bittersweet World&quot; was released in the United States. The album went on to sell 126,000 copies within the first year of its release, making it her lowest-selling album to date. The release served as Simpson&#x27;s final album through Geffen Records.

In February 2008, Simpson began wearing a diamond ring. She later explained that it was a promise ring from Wentz. In April 2008, Simpson and Wentz confirmed their engagement, and they wed on May 17, 2008, at Simpson&#x27;s parents&#x27; residence in Encino, California, with her father officiating the ceremony. She changed her surname from Simpson to Wentz, and during the marriage was known professionally as Ashlee Simpson-Wentz. It was during this time that Simpson released the song &quot;Little Miss Obsessive&quot; as the second single from &quot;Bittersweet World&quot;. The song did not receive a European release and hit a peak of 96 on the Hot 100 chart in the United States. She also began appearing in commercials for Canadian retailer Zellers to promote their independent clothing line, &quot;Request&quot;, in mid-2008. Two weeks after her wedding, Simpson announced her pregnancy, thus ending promotion of &quot;Little Miss Obsessive&quot; and the parent album. Simpson gave birth to a son on November 20, 2008.

In 2009, Simpson returned full-time to television episodes by playing the role of Violet Foster in &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, The CW&#x27;s revamp of the 1990s series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. She was originally signed to the show as a regular, but producers and CW executives decided to write out her character. Simpson left the show after twelve episodes and stated that she had known all along that her character would leave the show once the murder mystery storyline had concluded. Despite this, Ashlee&#x27;s sister has spoken out against the series, claiming that Simpson brought the show free press. After her departure from &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Simpson reprised her role in the Broadway musical production of &quot;Chicago&quot;. She began her Broadway run on November 30, 2009, and performed in New York for eight shows a week until February 7, 2010. On February 9, 2011, Simpson filed for divorce from Wentz, citing irreconcilable differences, and asked that her maiden name be restored. The divorce was finalized on November 22, 2011. The former couple released a joint statement following the announcement, stating &quot;We remain friends and deeply committed and loving parents to our son Bronx, whose happiness and well-being remains our number one priority.&quot; Simpson appeared on the second episode of The CW&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model, Cycle 17&quot; as a guest judge. She created a fashion line aimed at girls aged seven to sixteen in collaboration with her sister&#x27;s successful brand. Simpson is the co-creative director of the line, which was released in the winter of 2011.

===2012–present: second marriage and television projects===
Shortly after her separation from Wentz, it was confirmed that Simpson was in a relationship with actor Vincent Piazza, though the two ended their relationship nearly a year and a half after they started dating. Simpson confirmed during an interview in 2011 that she had begun working on her fourth studio album, which she described as having a &quot;folk feel&quot;. In 2012, Simpson independently released the single &quot;Bat for a Heart&quot;. Though the single featured explicit lyrics and a racy music video, it failed to have any success. The track was written and composed by songwriter Linda Perry. The song received a mixed reception upon its release. Simpson later claimed that the album was developing more of an electronic sound. However, &quot;Bat for a Heart&quot; served as Simpson&#x27;s final musical release for several years afterward, with no future musical plans announced and her music website being shut down. In June 2012, it was announced that Simpson was filming &quot;Pawn Shop Chronicles&quot; in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a comedy movie released in 2013.

Simpson portrayed the character of Roxie Hart for a third time in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, this time in the Hollywood Bowl production of the show. Simpson&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews, though she was described as an &quot;audience favorite&quot;. In July 2013, it was reported that Simpson had begun dating actor Evan Ross, son of singer Diana Ross. Simpson and Ross became engaged in January 2014, and married on August 30, 2014, at Diana Ross&#x27;s estate in Connecticut. The couple welcomed a daughter on July 30, 2015. The same month, Simpson and her husband filed requests to change their surname to Ross-Næss. Næss was her husband&#x27;s original legal surname (from his father, businessman Arne Næss Jr.), while Ross was his mother&#x27;s surname.

In May 2016, Simpson said she was eschewing a possible return to acting in order to focus on making a new album: &quot;I&#x27;ve been writing music with my husband and that&#x27;s been so much fun, we&#x27;ve just been [trying to] find our sound, we&#x27;ve written like 10 songs but we&#x27;re going to write a whole bunch more.&quot; But in early 2005, her music website went offline—with an error—for months and, as of early September 2018, it remained offline despite her claims to return to music. In 2018, Simpson and Evan Ross teamed up with French brand Zadig &amp; Voltaire and designed a unisex clothing collection titled &quot;Jagger Snow&quot;.

That same year, Simpson voiced Strelka in the animated movie &quot;Space Dogs Adventure to the Moon&quot;, alongside Alicia Silverstone. Simpson also confirmed to &quot;Us Weekly&quot; that new music would be released in 2019, which appeared to suggest she was working on her upcoming fourth studio album after an eleven-year hiatus.

On September 9, 2018, she was slated to return to the world of TV-reality shows with &quot;Ashlee+Evan&quot;, on E! Entertainment Television. Simpson and Ross released their debut duet single, &quot;I Do&quot;, on September 7, 2018. The couple was expected to release a full-length album later that year, but instead released an extended play record, &quot;Ashlee + Evan&quot;.

In April 2020, Simpson announced she was pregnant with her third child, a son. She gave birth on October 29, 2020.

She played Kate in the Christmas film &quot;The Recipe Files&quot;, aired on QVC+ on November 24, 2023.

==Public image==
Simpson has appeared on the covers of numerous magazines, including the USA&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, &quot;Jane, CosmoGirl&quot;, &quot;Shape&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;YM&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot;; Germany&#x27;s &quot;Glamour&quot;; Japan&#x27;s &quot;Blenda&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;; and Russia&#x27;s &quot;Elle Girl&quot;. She has appeared on several international editions of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, such as Georgia, Serbia, Russia, Italy, Greece, Ukraine, Slovenia, Netherlands, US and Australia. She has appeared in television commercials for Liquid Ice, HP, Zellers and Pizza Hut. She appeared in print ads for Skechers and ThermaSilk.

&quot;Forbes&quot; listed Simpson as one of the &quot;Richest Young Celebrities&quot;, it is reported she earned $8.3 million in 2005. &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Simpson and her then-husband Pete Wentz at No. 20 on their list of &quot;Top 20 Celebrity Cash Couples&quot; with their $9.5 million combined income.

With the release of &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Simpson instantaneously became marketed as an &quot;anti-Britney&quot;, drawing comparisons to artists such as Avril Lavigne and Fefe Dobson. The media noted her &quot;punk-rock&quot; image and style as a contrast to her sister Jessica. With the success of Jessica&#x27;s reality television series &quot;Newlyweds&quot;, the sisters became household names in the media and became the focus of much attention. She cites her childhood as being the time when she began to sing and admits that she dreamed of being on Broadway and did not expect to break into the pop music scene.

Vocally, Simpson is an alto with a two-octave vocal range. She trains with a vocal coach, and studies Etta James and Aretha Franklin albums for vocal inspiration. She has cited Guns N&#x27; Roses, Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, Joan Jett, The Runaways, Madonna, Pat Benatar, Green Day, Alanis Morissette, Fiona Apple, Chrissie Hynde, and Debbie Harry from Blondie as her musical influences.

<doc id="700312" wikidata="Q2266040" url="?curid=700312" title="Tatsumi Hijikata">
<text>was a Japanese choreographer, and the founder of a genre of dance performance art called Butoh. By the late 1960s, he had begun to develop this dance form, which is highly choreographed with stylized gestures drawn from his childhood memories of his northern Japan home. It is this style which is most often associated with Butoh by Westerners.

==Life and Butoh==

Tatsumi Hijikata was born Kunio Yoneyama on March 9, 1928 in Akita prefecture in northern Japan, the tenth in a family of eleven children. After having shuttled back and forth between Tokyo and his hometown from 1947, he moved to Tokyo permanently in 1952. He claims to have initially survived as a petty criminal through acts of burglary and robbery, but since he was known to embellish details of his life, it is not clear how much his account can be trusted. At the time, he studied tap, jazz, flamenco, ballet, and German expressionist dance. He undertook his first Ankoku Butoh performance, &quot;Kinjiki&quot;, in 1959, using a novel by Yukio Mishima as the raw input material for an abrupt, sexually-inflected act of choreographic violence which stunned its audience. At around that time, Hijikata met three figures who would be crucial collaborators for his future work: Yukio Mishima, Eikoh Hosoe, and Donald Richie. In 1962, he and his partner Motofuji Akiko established a dance studio, Asbestos Hall, in the Meguro district of Tokyo, which would be the base for his choreographic work for the rest of his life; a shifting company of young dancers gathered around him there.

Hijikata conceived of Ankoku Butoh from its origins as an outlaw form of dance-art, and as constituting the negation of all existing forms of Japanese dance. Inspired by the criminality of the French novelist Jean Genet, Hijikata wrote manifestoes of his emergent dance form with such as titles as &#x27;To Prison&#x27;. His dance would be one of corporeal extremity and transmutation, driven by an obsession with death, and imbued with an implicit repudiation of contemporary society and media power. Many of his early works were inspired by figures of European literature such as the Marquis de Sade and the Comte de Lautréamont, as well as by the French Surrealist movement, which had exerted an immense influence on Japanese art and literature, and had led to the creation of an autonomous and influential Japanese variant of Surrealism, whose most prominent figure was the poet Shuzo Takiguchi, who perceived Ankoku Butoh as a distinctively &#x27;Surrealist&#x27; dance-art form.

Especially at the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Hijikata undertook collaborations with filmmakers, photographers, urban architects and visual artists as an essential element of his approach to choreography&#x27;s intersections with other art forms. Among the most exceptional of these collaborations was his work with the Japanese photographer Eikoh Hosoe on the book &quot;Kamaitachi&quot;, which involved a series of journeys back to northern Japan in order to embody the presence of mythical, dangerous figures at the peripheries of Japanese life. The book references stories of a supernatural being — &#x27;sickle-weasel&#x27; — said to have haunted the Japanese countryside of Hosoe&#x27;s childhood. In the photographs, Hijikata is seen as wandering the stark landscape and confronting farmers and children.

From 1960 onward, Hijikata funded his Ankoku Butoh projects by undertaking sex-cabaret work with his company of dancers, and also acted in prominent films of the Japanese &#x27;erotic-grotesque&#x27; horror-film genre, in such works as the director Teruo Ishii&#x27;s &quot;Horrors of Malformed Men&quot; and &quot;Blind Woman&#x27;s Curse&quot;, in both of which Hijikata performed Ankoku Butoh sequences.

Hijikata&#x27;s period as a public performer and choreographer extended from his performance of Kinjiki in 1959 to his famous solo work, &quot;Hijikata Tatsumi and Japanese People: Revolt of the Body&quot; (inspired by preoccupations with the Roman Emperor Heliogabalus and the work of Hans Bellmer) in 1968, and then to his solo dances within group choreography such as &quot;Twenty-seven Nights for Four Seasons&quot; in 1972. He last appeared on stage as a guest performer in Dairakudakan&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Myth of the Phallus&quot;. During the years from the late 60&#x27;s through 1976, Hijikata experimented with using extensive surrealist imagery to alter movements. Then, Hijikata then gradually withdrew into the Asbestos Hall and devoted his time to writing and to training his dance-company. Throughout the period in which he had performed in public, Hijikata&#x27;s work had been perceived as scandalous and the object of revulsion, part of a &#x27;dirty avant-garde&#x27; which refused to assimilate itself to Japanese traditional art, power or society. However, Hijikata himself perceived his work as existing beyond the parameters of the era&#x27;s avant-garde movements, and commented: &#x27;I&#x27;ve never thought of myself as avant-garde. If you run around a race-track and are a full circuit behind everyone else, then you are alone and appear to be first. Maybe that is what happened to me...&#x27;.

Hijikata&#x27;s period of seclusion and silence in the Asbestos Hall allowed him to mesh his Ankoku Butoh preoccupations with his memories of childhood in northern Japan, one result of which was the publication of a hybrid book-length text on memory and corporeal transformation, entitled &quot;Ailing Dancer&quot; (1983); he also compiled scrapbooks in which he annotated art-images cut from magazines with fragmentary reflections on corporeality and dance. By the mid-1980s, Hijikata was emerging from his long period of withdrawal, in particular by choreographing work for the dancer Kazuo Ohno, with whom he had begun working in the early 1960s, and whose work had become a prominent public manifestation of Butoh, despite deep divisions in the respective preoccupations of Hijikata and Ohno. During Hijikata&#x27;s seclusion, Butoh had begun to attract worldwide attention. Hijikata envisaged performing in public again, and developed new projects, but died abruptly from liver failure in January 1986, at the age of 57. Asbestos Hall, which had operated as a drinking club and film venue as well as a dance studio, was eventually sold-off and converted into a private house in the 2000s, but Hijikata&#x27;s film works, scrapbooks and other artefacts were eventually collected in the form of an archive, at Keio University in Tokyo. Hijikata remains a vital figure of inspiration, in Japan and worldwide, not only for choreographers and performers, but also for visual artists, filmmakers, writers, musicians, architects, and digital artists.

==Origins of Butoh==

Kinjiki (Forbidden Colors) by Tatsumi Hijikata, premiered at a dance festival in 1959. It was based on the novel of the same name by Yukio Mishima. It explored the taboo of homosexuality and ended with a live chicken being smothered between the legs of Kazuo Ohno&#x27;s son Yoshito Ohno, after which Hijikata chasing Yoshito off the stage in darkness. Mainly as a result of the audience outrage over this piece, Hijikata was banned from the festival, establishing him as an iconoclast.

The earliest butoh performances were called (in English) &quot;Dance Experience&quot;. In the early 1960s, Hijikata used the term &quot;Ankoku-Buyou&quot; (暗黒舞踊 – dance of darkness) to describe his dance. He later changed the word &quot;buyo,&quot; filled with associations of Japanese classical dance, to &quot;butoh,&quot; a long-discarded word for dance that originally meant European ballroom dancing.

In later work, Hijikata continued to subvert conventional notions of dance. Inspired by writers such as Yukio Mishima (as noted above), Lautréamont, Artaud, Genet and de Sade, he delved into grotesquerie, darkness, and decay. At the same time, Hijikata explored the transmutation of the human body into other forms, such as those of animals. He also developed a poetic and surreal choreographic language, butoh-fu (fu means &quot;word&quot; in Japanese), to help the dancer transform into other states of being.

<text>Disinflation is a decrease in the rate of inflation – a slowdown in the rate of increase of the general price level of goods and services in a nation&#x27;s gross domestic product over time. It is the opposite of reflation. 

If the inflation rate is not very high to start with, disinflation can lead to deflation – decreases in the general price level of goods and services. For example if the annual inflation rate one month is 5% and it is 4% the following month, prices disinflated by 1% but are still increasing at a 4% annual rate. If the current rate is 1% and it is the -2% the following month, prices disinflated by 3% and are decreasing at a 2% annual rate.

<doc id="700322" wikidata="Q3017669" url="?curid=700322" title="David Christopherson">
<text>David Christopherson (born October 5, 1954) is a Canadian politician. From 2004 until 2019, he represented the riding of Hamilton Centre in the House of Commons of Canada. He previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the provincial government of Bob Rae. Christopherson is a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Early life and career==

Christopherson was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He is self-educated, having dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. A voracious reader, he is a particular fan of books on politics. He began working with International Harvester in Hamilton at age 19, and remained with the company for eleven years. He was active with the United Auto Workers union, becoming plant chairman in 1978 and president of the Local 525 in 1979.

Christopherson campaigned in Hamilton East in the 1984 federal election, finishing second against Liberal candidate Sheila Copps. He was elected to Hamilton, Ontario City Council the following year for the city&#x27;s fourth ward, and re-elected in 1988. Christopherson became chairman of Hamilton&#x27;s licensing committee, and made a concerted effort to reform the city&#x27;s notorious regulatory practices. He developed a reputation on as a hard worker, and was one of three councillors to decline a pay increase in 1988.

Christopherson was also a constituency assistant for NDP Member of Parliament (MP) Ian Deans in the mid-1980s. He sought the NDP nomination for Hamilton Mountain after Deans&#x27;s retirement in 1986, but lost to Marion Dewar.

==Provincial politics==

===Government backbencher===

Christopherson was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Liberal cabinet minister Lily Oddie Munro in Hamilton Centre as the NDP won a majority government across the province. He was chair of caucus and parliamentary assistant to Provincial Treasurer Floyd Laughren from 1990 to 1992.

===Cabinet minister===

Christopherson was respected by all parties for his legislative work ethic and contributions to the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, and was widely considered as one of the most skilled backbenchers in the government caucus. There was little surprise when he was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Correctional Services on September 23, 1992, notwithstanding that Hamilton already had three representatives in cabinet.

Christopherson&#x27;s portfolio was extremely challenging, and was described by one journalist as &quot;one of the worst jobs in government&quot;. The Correctional Services ministry had previously been damaged by reports of sexual abuse and intimidation involving staff at Ontario jails and training centres, and Christopherson was required to enact substantial internal reforms. He supported former NDP leader Stephen Lewis&#x27;s recommendations on race relations in the criminal justice system, and made efforts to address racism in Ontario prisons.

On February 3, 1993, Christopherson was given additional cabinet responsibilities as Solicitor General of Ontario. This was also a difficult portfolio, and Christopherson has since acknowledged that relations between the Rae government and Ontario police services were extremely tense when he entered the ministry. He has been credited with improving this situation, winning the respect of many in the police community. Julian Fantino, then an executive member of the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, commented that there was &quot;marked improvement&quot; in relations following Christopherson&#x27;s appointment.

Christopherson allowed semi-automatic weapons to be issued to officers in late 1993. This was supported by many in the police service, but was criticized by some in the legal community on the grounds that the new weapons were not safer than the .38 models they replaced. Christopherson also introduced new guidelines for targeting hate crimes, and mandated stricter standards for police investigations of spousal assault. Early in 1995, he announced that police would soon be given the right to warn the general public about sex offenders released into residential neighbourhoods.

In May 1994, Christopherson introduced a pilot project to reduce illegal gun ownership in Ontario. For a three-month period, Ontarians were permitted to turn over illegal or unwanted firearms to the police without risking prosecution for illegal possession. The policy was endorsed by the police community. After three months, the ministry announced that 1,000 pistols and revolvers, 2,000 rifles and shotguns and over 150,000 rounds of ammunition had been turned over to the police.

In addition to his official cabinet portfolios, Christopherson was also responsible for articulating the Rae government&#x27;s strategy for the proposed Red Hill Creek Expressway in Hamilton. Although he had previously opposed the project for environmental and other reasons, Christopherson argued in 1994 that a scaled-back four-lane highway would be the &quot;best possible compromise&quot; under the circumstances. The Rae government approved the plan, although it was later rejected by the succeeding ministry.

Christopherson was widely respected for his abilities in cabinet, and often won praise from members of the opposition. Progressive Conservative Bob Runciman credited him for his competence and managerial skills, while Liberal Tim Murphy described him as &quot;the best of a bad bunch&quot;. He served until the defeat of the Rae government in 1995.

===Opposition member===

The Rae government was defeated in the 1995 election, falling to only seventeen seats out of 130. Christopherson, still personally popular, was narrowly re-elected for Hamilton Centre. He served in the next legislature as NDP critic for labour issues and the Workers&#x27; Compensation Board.

Rae resigned as party leader in 1996, and there was considerable media speculation that Christopherson would run to succeed him. &quot;Toronto Star&quot; journalist Thomas Walkom indicated that he would be a powerful candidate on the centrist wing of the party, and would likely win the support of pro-Rae trade unions such as the Steelworkers. He decided against running and gave his support to Howard Hampton, the eventual winner.

Christopherson was a prominent supporter of Hamilton&#x27;s amalgamation with neighbouring municipalities in the late 1990s. The policy, which was supported by some members of all three major parties, was enacted by the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris in 2000. Christopherson considered leaving politics to run for the leadership of the Ontario Federation of Labour in 1997, but ultimately declined.

The Hamilton Centre riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1996, and Christopherson chose to contest the expanded riding of Hamilton West for the 1999 provincial election against incumbent Progressive Conservative Lillian Ross. He was re-elected, and became one of only nine New Democrats returned to the reduced 103-seat legislature. He served as his party&#x27;s Finance and Labour Critic, and was appointed as House Leader. He considered campaigning for Mayor of Hamilton in 2000, but reluctantly declined.

Christopherson resigned as NDP House Leader in 2001, amid rumours of a rift with Hampton. He continued to serve as his party&#x27;s critic for Consumer and Business Services and the Management Board of Cabinet, and was a deputy speaker in the legislature from 2001 to 2003.

==Mayoral campaign==

Christopherson did not seek re-election to the legislature in 2003. He instead campaigned for mayor of Hamilton in that year&#x27;s municipal campaign. He promised to reform the city&#x27;s disclosure laws, requiring municipal politicians to declare their assets, debts and holdings. He also spoke out against plans to build an incinerator in the city for waste disposal. He was supported by two teachers&#x27; unions and the city firefighters&#x27; union, as well as by Liberal MPP Dominic Agostino from Hamilton East. Initially considered the frontrunner, he was ultimately defeated by rival candidate Larry Di Ianni. Hamilton&#x27;s amalgamation with the more right-leaning suburbs was a factor, as was Christopherson&#x27;s opposition to a revised Red Hill Expressway.

==Federal politician==

Christopherson returned to political life a few months later, defeating Liberal cabinet minister Stan Keyes to win the Hamilton Centre riding in the 2004 federal election. The Liberal Party won a minority government, and Christopherson served as NDP critic for cities, community infrastructure, labour and steel policy in the 38th parliament. He was part of a Canadian delegation that observed presidential elections in Ukraine in late 2004.

He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election with an increased majority, as the Conservatives won a minority government nationally. In May 2006, he called for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rather than the government to investigate a leak of the Auditor General&#x27;s report into the Canadian gun registry. Christopherson suspected that someone connected to the government may have been responsible for the leak, given its &quot;self-serving&quot; nature. He has also criticized the previous Liberal government for allowing billions in unpaid tax monies to remain uncollected.

Christopherson was re-elected to his federal seat again in the 2008 federal election, and the 2011 federal election.

Christopherson is often described as a pragmatic politician. He once said that he has never been a &quot;hard-line ideologue&quot;, but &quot;the NDP is where I&#x27;m most comfortable.&quot;

He was appointed Defence Critic for the NDP after Jack Layton&#x27;s death, and appointed one of the three deputy leaders, by Layton&#x27;s successor Thomas Mulcair.

After the 2015 federal election, Christopherson was appointed as the NDP&#x27;s critic for the Planning and Priorities Committee and for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

Christopherson was involved in the so-called &#x27;Elbowgate&#x27; political confrontation on 18 May 2016. Video of the floor of the House of Commons appears to show the MP moving from side to side impeding the path of Conservative whip, Gord Brown MP.

==Planned retirement==

On July 5, 2018, Christopherson announced his plan to retire at the end of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, and to not seek re-election in the 2019 federal election.

&quot;It has been my distinct honour to have served as the councillor for Ward 4, the Member of Provincial Parliament for Hamilton Centre and now as the federal Member of Parliament for Hamilton Centre,&quot; Christopherson wrote in his statement. &quot;I truly love our city and the people who call it home. To have earned the trust and confidence of the people of Hamilton for so many years is truly humbling and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to join with so many dedicated people working to help build a stronger, more fair and diverse community.&quot;

<text>Reuben Wood (1792/1793October 1, 1864) was a Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. He served as the 21st governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Wood was born near Middletown, Rutland County, Vermont, in either 1792 or 1793. While living with an uncle in Canada after his father died, Wood was conscripted into the Canadian Army at the outset of the War of 1812, but escaped across Lake Ontario and briefly served in the Vermont militia.

==Career==
Wood moved to Cleveland, Ohiothen a tiny village of 600 residentsin 1818 with his wife and infant daughter. He reputedly arrived with only $1.25 left to his name to work as a lawyer. He served in the Ohio State Senate from 1825 to 1830. In 1830, he was elected President Judge of the third judicial circuit. He served on the Common Pleas Court bench from 1830 to 1833.

Wood was elected in 1833 to the Ohio Supreme Court, and served two seven-year terms from 1833 to 1847. He was defeated in a bid for a third term by a Whig candidate. He took office in late 1850 as governor. His first term was cut short by the implementation of a new state constitution, and he was re-elected in late 1851, re-inaugurated in early 1852. He resigned on July 13, 1853, to take a position as the American consul in Valparaíso, Chile. He remained there until 1855, when he retired to Cleveland.

Wood married Mary Rice, of Clarendon, Vermont, in 1816 or 1817. They had two daughters.

Wood was known as The tall chief of the Cuyahogas, or Cuyahoga Chief, or Old Cuyahoga Chief, or Old Chief of the Cuyahogas.

==Death==
Wood died at his farm, &quot;Evergreen Place&quot;, eight miles west of Cleveland, on October 1, 1864, from bilious colic. He was initially interred on the farm, and was later reburied at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland.

<doc id="700326" wikidata="Q163491" url="?curid=700326" title="Ars antiqua">
<text>Ars antiqua, also called ars veterum or ars vetus, is a term used by modern scholars to refer to the Medieval music of Europe during the High Middle Ages, between approximately 1170 and 1310. This covers the period of the Notre-Dame school of polyphony (the use of multiple, simultaneous, independent melodic lines), and the subsequent years which saw the early development of the motet, a highly varied choral musical composition. Usually the term &quot;ars antiqua&quot; is restricted to sacred (church) or polyphonic music, excluding the secular (non-religious) monophonic songs of the troubadours, and trouvères. Although colloquially the term &quot;ars antiqua&quot; is used more loosely to mean all European music of the 13th century, and from slightly before.

The term &quot;ars antiqua&quot; is used in opposition to &quot;ars nova&quot; (meaning &quot;new art&quot;, &quot;new technique&quot; or &quot;new style&quot;). The transition from ars antiqua into ars nova is not clearly defined, recent interpretation has described the transition to be a gradual evolution rather than an abrupt revolution with the period being between the 13th–14th centuries.

==History==
The original Medieval usage of the expression &quot;ars antiqua&quot;, found in the &quot;Speculum Musice&quot; of Jacobus and also by Johannes de Muris (the only one to use the exact term &quot;ars antiqua&quot;), referred specifically to the period of Franco of Cologne, approximately 1250–1310, but this restricted usage is rarely employed in modern scholarship. Almost all composers of the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; are anonymous. Léonin ( late 12th century), and Pérotin (fl. ) were the two composers known by name from the Notre Dame school; in the subsequent period, Petrus de Cruce, a composer of motets, is one of the few whose name has been preserved.

In music theory the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; period saw several advances over previous practice, most of them in conception, and notation of rhythm. In the early Medieval music era, notation indicated the pitches of songs without indicating the rhythm that these notes should be sung in. The most famous music theorist of the first half of the 13th century, Johannes de Garlandia, was the author of the &quot;De Mensurabili Musica&quot; (c. 1240), the treatise which defined, and most completely elucidated rhythmic modes.

A German theorist of a slightly later period, Franco of Cologne, was the first to describe a system of notation in which differently shaped notes have entirely different rhythmic values (in the &quot;Ars cantus mensurabilis,&quot; c. 1280), an innovation which had a massive impact on the subsequent history of European music. Most of the surviving notated music of the 13th century uses the rhythmic modes as defined by Garlandia.

Though the style of the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; went out of fashion rather suddenly in the first two decades of the 14th century, it had a late defender in Jacques of Liège (alternatively known as Jacob of Liège), who wrote a violent attack on the &quot;irreverent, and corrupt&quot; &quot;ars nova&quot; in his &quot;Speculum Musicae&quot; (c. 1320) vigorously defending the old style in a manner suggestive of any number of music critics from the Middle Ages to the present day. To Jacques, the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; was the &quot;musica modesta&quot;, and the &quot;ars nova&quot; was a &quot;musica lasciva&quot;—a kind of music which he considered to be excessively indulgent, capricious, immodest, and sensual.

<text>Limeade, also called lime soda, is a lime-flavored, sometimes carbonated, drink. It is usually sweetened with sugar or sweeteners. A common method of preparation is to juice limes and combine the juice with simple syrup or honey syrup, along with some water and perhaps more sugar or honey. Vodka or white tequila can be added to make a limeade cocktail. The exact ingredients, preparation and names of the drink can vary by country.

Most major beverage companies now offer their own brand of limeade, such as A.G. Barr of Glasgow and Newman&#x27;s Own since 2004, with Minute Maid introducing a cherry limeade drink in response to the popularity of limeade.

Sonic Drive-In uses Sprite to create its popular cherry limeade.

Limeade is popular in tropical countries such as Jamaica where limes are common.

It is one of the most popular drinks in India and Pakistan and is known as nimbu paani or limbu pani; lemons can also be used for nimbu paani.
Limeade is also widely available in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia due to the abundance of limes and relative rarity of lemons, as lemons are not a native species. A Thai-styled limeade tastes salty, and sometimes does not have any sugar.

<text>Ars nova () refers to a musical style which flourished in the Kingdom of France and its surroundings during the Late Middle Ages. More particularly, it refers to the period between the preparation of the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot; (1310s) and the death of composer Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The term is sometimes used more generally to refer to all European polyphonic music of the fourteenth century. For instance, the term &quot;Italian &quot; is sometimes used to denote the music of Francesco Landini and his compatriots, although Trecento music is the more common term for the contemporary 14th-century music in Italy. The &quot;ars&quot; in &quot;ars nova&quot; can be read as &quot;technique&quot;, or &quot;style&quot;. The term was first used in two musical treatises, titled &quot;Ars novae musicae&quot; (New Technique of Music) () by Johannes de Muris, and a collection of writings (c. 1322) attributed to Philippe de Vitry often simply called &quot;Ars nova&quot; today. Musicologist Johannes Wolf first applied to the term as description of an entire era (as opposed to merely specific persons) in 1904.

The term is often used in juxtaposition to two other periodic terms, of which the first, , refers to the music of the immediately preceding age, usually extending back to take in the period of Notre Dame polyphony (from about 1170 to 1320). Roughly, then, refers to music of the thirteenth century, and the that of the fourteenth; many music histories use the terms in this more general sense.

The period from the death of Machaut (1377) until the early fifteenth century, including the rhythmic innovations of the , is sometimes considered the end of, or late, but at other times an independent era in music. Other musical periods and styles have at various times been called &quot;new art.&quot; Johannes Tinctoris used the term to describe Dunstaple; however, in modern historiographical usage, it is restricted entirely to the period described above.

== Versus ==

Stylistically, the music of the differed from the preceding era in several ways. Developments in notation allowed notes to be written with greater rhythmic independence, shunning the limitations of the rhythmic modes which prevailed in the thirteenth century; secular music acquired much of the polyphonic sophistication previously found only in sacred music; and new techniques and forms, such as isorhythm and the isorhythmic motet, became prevalent. The overall aesthetic effect of these changes was to create music of greater expressiveness and variety than had been the case in the thirteenth century. Indeed, the sudden historical change which occurred, with its startling new degree of musical expressiveness, can be likened to the introduction of perspective in painting, and it is useful to consider that the changes to music in the period of the were contemporary with the great early Renaissance revolutions in painting and literature.

The most famous practitioner of the new musical style was Guillaume de Machaut, who also had a distinguished career as a canon at Reims Cathedral and as a poet. The ars-nova style is evident in his considerable body of motets, lais, virelais, rondeaux and ballades.

Towards the end of the fourteenth century, a new stylistic school of composers and poets centered in Avignon in southern France developed; the highly mannered style of this period is often called the , although some scholars have chosen to consider it a late development of the rather than separating it into a separate school. This strange but interesting repertory of music, limited in geographical distribution (southern France, Aragon and later Cyprus), and clearly intended for performance by specialists for an audience of connoisseurs, is like an &quot;end note&quot; to the entire Middle Ages.

<text>John Campbell Merriam (October 20, 1869 – October 30, 1945) was an American paleontologist, educator, and conservationist. The first vertebrate paleontologist on the West Coast of the United States, he is best known for his taxonomy of vertebrate fossils at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, particularly with the genus &quot;Smilodon&quot;, more commonly known as the sabertooth cat. He is also known for his work to extend the reach of the National Park Service.

==Biography==
He was born in Hopkinton, Iowa, the eldest child of postmaster, store proprietor, and American Civil War veteran Charles E. Merriam. His middle name Campbell was his mother&#x27;s middle name, and the maiden name of his maternal grandmother.

Both his father Charles E. Merriam and his paternal uncle Henry C. Merriam had served as officers in the 12th Iowa Infantry, Company K; after capture at the Battle of Shiloh, they were sent to Libby Prison for some time before being returned to the battlefields. Eventually, when the two brothers were mustered out, they returned to Iowa, married, and raised families.
As a young man, he began collecting Paleozoic invertebrate fossils near his Iowa home. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Lenox College in Hopkinton, Iowa, his father&#x27;s alma mater, then went to the University of California to study geology and botany under Joseph Le Conte. He later went to Munich, Germany, to study under the famous paleontologist Karl von Zittel. In 1894 he returned to the U.S. and joined the faculty at the University of California, teaching and performing research in both vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology.

In 1901 one of his lectures on paleontology inspired the young Annie Montague Alexander, who financed and took part in his expedition that year to Fossil Lake in Oregon. Alexander, who went on to a lifelong career as a paleontological benefactress, financed his subsequent expeditions to Mount Shasta in 1902 and 1903, as well as his famous 1905 Saurian Expedition to the West Humboldt Range in Nevada. During this expedition Merriam unearthed 25 specimens of ichthyosaur, many of them considered the finest ever found.

In 1903 he was recognized as an Associate Member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a wildlife conservation organization founded in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell.

In 1912 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Paleontology at the University of California. That same year he began his famous studies of vertebrates at the La Brea Tar Pits. He and his students categorized many of the vertebrate fossils found at the site, and many more were placed in storage. The smilodon was later established as the California state fossil.

In 1914, Merriam was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1918, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. That same year, he co-founded the Save the Redwoods League, which began significant preservation efforts after Merriam traveled the Redwood areas of Humboldt County, California in 1922 seeking to spare its old-growth the effects of logging he witnessed in Redwood forests closer to San Francisco. A biography, which details his efforts to preserve wild lands in California and throughout the United States, was published in 2005.

In 1919, Merriam served as president of the Geological Society of America.

In 1920 he was appointed Dean of Faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, but he left that same year to become president of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. His departure caused the university to combine the Paleontology Department with the Geology Department, angering Merriam&#x27;s benefactress, Annie Alexander, who subsequently founded and endowed the university&#x27;s Museum of Paleontology. As the head of Carnegie Institution, Merriam&#x27;s administrative duties led to a reduction in his research for the rest of his career. He accomplishments as president included helping to advance the educational programs of the National Park Service, as well as helping to preserve the California redwoods. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. His published papers are collected in a four-volume set published in 1938 by the Carnegie Institution.

Merriam was a founding member of the Galton Institute and a cautious political supporter of eugenics.

Notably, his paternal first cousin Frank Merriam, the eldest child of Civil War veteran Henry C. Merriam, served as the 28th Governor of California between 1934 and 1939.

<doc id="700371" wikidata="Q4350437" url="?curid=700371" title="Interference (chess)">
<text>In the game of chess, interference occurs when the line between an attacked piece and its defender is interrupted by sacrificially interposing a piece. It is a chess tactic which seldom arises, and is therefore often overlooked. Opportunities for interference are rare because the defended object must be more valuable than the sacrificed piece, and the interposition must itself present a threat. Huczek defines interference as a tactic involving blocking moves that obstruct lines of attack. This definition may be expanded by including blocking moves that disrupt lines of defense.
==Examples==

In diagram A, White to play will apparently be obliged to retreat the knight from f5, because the squares to which it could advance are all guarded. The interference move 1.Nd6+, however, interrupts the black rook&#x27;s defense of the black queen. If Black plays either 1...cxd6 or 1...Bxd6, White will capture Black&#x27;s queen. Therefore, Black has no better play than 1...Rxd6 2.exd6 Qxe2 3.Rxe2 Bxd6, conceding the exchange for a pawn.

A more subtle example of interference occurs when the interposing piece interrupts two lines simultaneously. In this case, the moving piece does not have to pose a threat by itself. Instead, it makes the opponent &quot;trip over their own feet&quot; because capturing the offending piece will necessarily break one line of defense or the other.
In diagram B, White is at a disadvantage, and apparently can&#x27;t queen the a-pawn because the black bishop guards the queening square. However, 1.Nd5 interferes with the bishop and with the black rooks&#x27; defense of each other. If 1...Bxd5, 2.Rxd8 is crushing. If 1...R8xd5, then 2.Rh8 mate. The best Black can do is 1...R2xd5, interfering with the bishop&#x27;s guard of a8 and permitting 2.a8=Q.

Although interferences are quite rare in actual play, they are a common theme in chess problems. The device in the last example above, in which a sacrifice occurs on the intersection of the defensive lines of two differently moving pieces, is known to problemists as a &quot;Novotny&quot;. Various other types of interference are given specific names in problem terminology, including the Grimshaw, Plachutta (where the two pieces both move orthogonally; see a beautiful example by Tarrasch), anti-Bristol, Holzhausen and Wurzburg–Plachutta.

<doc id="700374" wikidata="Q944350" url="?curid=700374" title="Richard Speck">
<text>Richard Benjamin Speck (December 6, 1941 – December 5, 1991) was an American mass murderer who killed eight student nurses in their South Deering, Chicago, residence via stabbing, strangling, slashing their throats, or a combination of the three on the night of July 13–14, 1966. Speck also raped one victim before killing her. A ninth potential victim, student nurse Corazon Amurao, survived by hiding beneath a bed.

Convicted of all eight murders on April 15, 1967, Speck was sentenced to death. His sentence was reduced to 400–1,200 years in 1972. This was later reduced to 100–300 years. Speck died of a heart attack while incarcerated at Stateville Correctional Center on the eve of his 50th birthday.

== Early life and crimes ==
=== Childhood ===
Richard Benjamin Speck was born in Kirkwood, Illinois, in 1941 and was the seventh of eight children of Benjamin Franklin Speck and Mary Margaret Carbaugh. The family moved to Monmouth, Illinois, shortly after Speck&#x27;s birth. He and his sister Carolyn (b. 1943) were much younger than their four older sisters and two older brothers. His mother was religious and a teetotaler. His father worked as a packer at Western Stoneware in Monmouth having previously worked as a farmer and logger.

In 1947, when Speck was six years old, his father died from a heart attack at the age of 53. Speck was reportedly very close to his father.

On May 10, 1950, three years after the death of his father, his mother Mary married Carl August Rudolph Lindberg in Palo Pinto, Texas. She and Lindberg had met during a train ride to Chicago. Lindberg was a traveling insurance salesman from Texas, with a 25-year criminal record that ranged from forgery to several DUIs. Lindberg was also a hard drinker unlike Speck&#x27;s father. Speck and his sister Carolyn stayed with their married sister Sara Thornton in Monmouth for a few months so Speck could finish second grade, before joining their mother and Lindberg in rural Santo, Texas, west of Fort Worth, Texas, where Speck attended third grade.

In 1952, Speck&#x27;s eldest brother, Robert, died in an automobile accident at the age of 23.

=== Dallas, 1951–1966 ===
In 1951, after a year in Santo, Speck moved with his mother, Lindberg, and sister Carolyn to East Dallas. Over the next 12 years, the family moved frequently, living at 10 different addresses, usually in poor neighborhoods. Speck loathed his stepfather who was often drunk, verbally abusive, and frequently absent.

Speck struggled in school, refusing to wear the glasses that he needed for reading. He repeated the eighth grade at J. L. Long Jr. High School, in part because of his refusal to speak in class, motivated by a fear of people staring at him. In autumn 1957, Speck started ninth grade at Crozier Technical High School, but failed every subject. Speck did not return for the second semester, dropping out of school in January 1958, after his 16th birthday.

Speck started drinking alcohol at age 12 and by age 15, he was getting drunk almost every day. His first arrest, in 1955 at age 13 for trespassing, was followed by dozens of other arrests for misdemeanors over the next eight years.

From 1960 to 1963, Speck worked as a laborer for the 7-Up bottling company in Dallas. In October 1961, Speck met 15-year-old Shirley Annette Malone at the Texas State Fair. She became pregnant after three weeks of dating. The couple married on January 19, 1962, and initially moved in with his sister Carolyn and her husband. Speck&#x27;s mother lived there as well having separated from Lindberg who was now living in California. Speck stopped using the name Richard Benjamin Lindberg when he got married and went back to using Richard Benjamin Speck. His daughter, Robbie Lynn Speck was born on July 5, 1962, while Speck was serving a 22-day jail sentence for disturbing the peace after a drunken melee in McKinney, Texas.

In July 1963, at the age of 21, Speck was sentenced to serve three years in prison after being convicted of forgery and burglary. Speck had forged and cashed a co-worker&#x27;s $44 paycheck () and also robbed a grocery store for cigarettes, beer, and $3 in cash (). He was paroled in 1965 after serving 16 months at Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. His release lasted a week. Speck was arrested again on January 9, 1965. Speck attacked a woman in the parking lot of her apartment building, wielding a carving knife, but fled when the woman screamed. The police arrived within minutes and apprehended Speck a few blocks away. Speck was convicted of aggravated assault, given a 16-month sentence to run concurrently with a parole violation sentence, and returned to prison in Huntsville. However, due to an error, he was released just six months later upon the completion of his parole violation sentence on July 2, 1965. After his release, Speck worked for three months as a driver for the Patterson Meat Company. Although he had six accidents in the company&#x27;s truck, he was only fired for failing to show up for work.

In December 1965, upon the recommendation of his mother, Speck moved in with a 29-year-old divorced woman, an ex-professional wrestler and now a bartender at his favorite bar, Ginny&#x27;s Lounge, to babysit her three children. In January 1966, Malone, who had been separated from Speck, filed for divorce. That same month, Speck stabbed a man in a knife fight at Ginny&#x27;s Lounge. He was charged with aggravated assault, but a defense attorney hired by his mother got the charge reduced to disturbing the peace. Speck was fined $10 () and jailed for three days after he failed to pay the fine. This was the last time Speck was in police custody in Dallas.

On March 5, 1966, Speck bought a 12-year-old car then robbed a grocery store the following evening, stealing 70 cartons of cigarettes, which he then sold out of the trunk of his car in the grocery store&#x27;s parking lot. The police traced the car (which Speck had abandoned) and issued a warrant for his arrest for burglary on March 8. Had he been apprehended under that warrant, it would have been his 42nd arrest in Dallas and would have surely resulted in another prison term. On March 9, 1966, Speck&#x27;s sister Carolyn drove him to the Dallas bus depot, where he took a bus to Chicago, Illinois.

=== Monmouth, March–April 1966 ===
Speck stayed with his sister Martha Thornton and her family in Chicago for a few days, and then returned to his boyhood hometown of Monmouth, Illinois, where he initially stayed with some old family friends. Speck&#x27;s brother Howard was a carpenter in Monmouth and found a job for him sanding plasterboard for another Monmouth carpenter. Speck became angry when he learned his ex-wife had remarried two days after she was granted a divorce on March 16, 1966. He moved to the Christy Hotel in downtown Monmouth on March 25 and spent most of his time in the downtown taverns. At the end of March, while Speck and some acquaintances were on a bar-hopping trip to Gulfport, Illinois they were detained overnight by police there after Speck reportedly threatened a man in a tavern restroom with his knife.

On April 3, Mrs. Virgil Harris, a 65-year-old resident of Monmouth, returned home at 1:00 a.m. to find a burglar in her house brandishing a knife. He was a 6-foot-tall white man who was &quot;very polite&quot; and spoke &quot;very softly with a Southern drawl.&quot; The man blindfolded her, tied her up, raped her, ransacked her house, and stole the $2.50 she had earned babysitting that evening.

A week later, Mary Kathryn Pierce, a 32-year-old barmaid who worked at her brother-in-law&#x27;s tavern, Frank&#x27;s Place, in downtown Monmouth, was last seen leaving the tavern at 12:20 a.m. on April 9. She was reported missing on April 13, and her body was found that day in an empty hog house behind the tavern. She had died from a blow to her abdomen that ruptured her liver.

Speck had frequented Frank&#x27;s Place, and the empty hog house was one of several he had helped build in the preceding month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce&#x27;s death when he showed up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning. When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they discovered he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he was just going to the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the previous month.

=== Chicago, April–June 1966 ===
On April 19, 1966, Speck returned to stay at his sister Martha&#x27;s second-floor apartment at 3966 N. Avondale Ave., in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest side of Chicago, where she lived with her husband, Gene Thornton, and their two teenage daughters. Martha had worked as a registered nurse in pediatrics before she was married, and her husband Gene worked nights as a railroad switchman. Speck told them an unbelievable story about having to leave Monmouth after refusing to sell narcotics for a &quot;crime syndicate&quot; there. Gene Thornton, who had served in the U.S. Navy, thought that the U.S. Merchant Marine might provide a suitable occupation for his unemployed brother-in-law, so on April 25 he took Speck to the U.S. Coast Guard office to apply for a letter of authority to work as an apprentice seaman. The application required being fingerprinted and photographed, and having a physical examination by a doctor.

Speck found work immediately after obtaining the letter of authority, joining the 33-member crew of Inland Steel&#x27;s &quot;Clarence B. Randall&quot;, an L6-S-B1 class bulk ore lake freighter, on April 30. Speck&#x27;s first voyage on the &quot;Clarence B. Randall&quot; was brief, since he was stricken with appendicitis on May 3, and was evacuated by U.S. Coast Guard helicopter to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Hancock, Michigan, on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula where he had an emergency appendectomy.

After he was discharged from the hospital, Speck returned to stay with his sister Martha and her family in Chicago to recuperate. On May 20, he rejoined the crew of the &quot;Clarence B. Randall&quot; on which he served until June 14, when he got drunk and quarreled with one of the boat&#x27;s officers and was put ashore on June 15. For the following week, Speck stayed at the St. Elmo, an East Side, Chicago flophouse at E. 99th St. &amp; S. Ewing Ave. Speck then traveled by train to Houghton, Michigan, staying at the Douglas House, to visit Judy Laakaniemi, a 28-year-old nurse&#x27;s aide going through a divorce, whom he had befriended at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital. On June 27, after Judy gave him $80 to help him until he found work, Speck left to again stay with his sister Martha and her family in Chicago for the next two weeks.

On June 30, Speck&#x27;s brother-in-law Gene drove him to the National Maritime Union (NMU) hiring hall at 2335 E. 100th St. in the Jeffery Manor neighborhood of South Deering, Chicago to file his paperwork for a seaman&#x27;s card. The NMU hiring hall was one block east of five attached two-story brick townhouses, three of which were occupied by South Chicago Community Hospital senior student nurses and Filipino exchange registered nurses. Eight of these nurses lived in the easternmost townhouse at 2319 E. 100th St., just from the NMU hiring hall.

=== Chicago, July 1966 ===
On Friday, July 8, 1966, Speck&#x27;s brother-in-law Gene drove him to the NMU hiring hall to pick up his seaman&#x27;s card and register for a berth on a ship. Speck lost out that day to a seaman with more seniority for a berth on the SS &quot;Flying Spray&quot;, a C1-A cargo ship bound for South Vietnam, and returned to his sister Martha&#x27;s apartment for the weekend.

By Monday, July 11, Speck had outstayed his welcome with his sister Martha and her family. After packing his bags and again being driven by his brother-in-law to the NMU hiring hall to await a berth on a ship, Speck stayed the night at Pauline&#x27;s rooming house, about away at 3028 E. 96th St., in the Vets Park neighborhood of South Deering, Chicago.

On Tuesday, July 12, Speck returned to the NMU hiring hall. In mid-afternoon, he received an assignment on Sinclair Oil&#x27;s tanker SS &quot;Sinclair Great Lakes&quot;, which was a 30-minute drive away in East Chicago, Indiana. When he arrived there, he found that his spot had already been taken, and he was driven back to the NMU hiring hall, which was then closed. Speck did not have enough money for a rooming house, so he dropped his bags off six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S. Torrence Ave. and slept in an unfinished house just off E. 103rd St.

On Wednesday, July 13, Speck picked up his bags and checked in at the NMU hiring hall. He was angry for being sent to a non-existent assignment, and he talked for 30 minutes in the car with his sister Martha and her husband Gene, who had driven down to visit him at 9 a.m. They parked on E. 100th St. next to Luella Elementary School, across the street from the townhouses where the nurses lived. At 10:30 a.m., he was tired of waiting at the NMU hiring hall for a job. Speck had $25 that his sister had given him, and he left and walked about east on E. 100th St. to check in at the Shipyard Inn at E. 101st St. &amp; S. Avenue N; the inn was an East Side, Chicago rooming house.

Speck spent the rest of the day drinking in nearby taverns before he accosted Ella Mae Hooper at knifepoint; she was a 53-year-old woman who had spent the day drinking at the same taverns that Speck had patronized. Speck took her to his room at the Shipyard Inn, raped her, and stole her black $16 mail-order .22 caliber Röhm pistol. He then left, dressed entirely in black, armed with a switchblade, and Ella Mae Hooper&#x27;s handgun. After dinner at the nearby Kay&#x27;s Pilot House, Speck returned to drink at the Shipyard Inn&#x27;s tavern until 10:20 p.m. and walked about west on E. 100th St. to the nurses&#x27; townhouse at 2319 E. 100th St.

==Murder of eight student nurses==

At 11 p.m. on July 13, 1966, Speck broke into the 2319 E. 100th St townhouse in Chicago&#x27;s Jeffery Manor neighborhood; the townhouse was functioning as a dormitory for student nurses. He entered and, using only a knife, killed Gloria Davy, Patricia Matusek, Nina Jo Schmale, Pamela Wilkening, Suzanne Farris, Mary Ann Jordan, Merlita Gargullo, and Valentina Pasion. Speck, who later claimed he was both drunk and high on drugs, may have originally planned to commit a routine burglary. Speck held the women in a room for hours, leading them out one by one, stabbing or strangling each to death, then finally raping and strangling his last victim, 22-year-old Gloria Davy. Intervals of between twenty and thirty minutes elapsed between each murder.

One woman, Corazon Amurao, escaped death because she crawled and hid under a bed while Speck was out of the room. Speck possibly lost count or might have known eight women lived in the townhouse but was unaware that a ninth woman was spending the night. Amurao stayed hidden until almost 6 a.m. Amurao and two of the murder victims, Gargullo and Pasion, were exchange nurses from the Philippines.

Fingerprints found at the scene were matched to Speck.

Two days after the murders, a drifter named Claude Lunsford identified Speck. Speck, Lunsford, and another man had been drinking the evening of July 15 on the fire escape of the Starr Hotel at 617 W. Madison. On July 16, Lunsford recognized a sketch of the murderer in the evening paper and phoned the police at 9:30 p.m. after finding Speck in his (Lunsford&#x27;s) room at the Starr Hotel. The police, however, did not respond to the call although their records showed the call had been made. Speck then attempted suicide, and the Starr Hotel desk clerk phoned in the emergency around midnight. Speck was taken to Cook County Hospital at 12:30 a.m. on July 17. At the hospital, Speck was recognized by Dr. LeRoy Smith, a 25-year-old surgical resident physician, who had read about the &quot;Born To Raise Hell&quot; tattoo in a newspaper story. The police were called, and Speck was finally arrested.

Concerns over the recent &quot;Miranda&quot; decision that had vacated the convictions of a number of criminals meant Speck was not even questioned for three weeks after his arrest.

==Pre-trial==
Felony Court Judge Herbert J. Paschen appointed an impartial panel to report on Speck&#x27;s competence to stand trial and his sanity at the time of the crime—a panel of three physicians suggested by the defense and three physicians selected by the prosecution, consisting of five psychiatrists and one general surgeon. The panel&#x27;s confidential report deemed Speck competent to stand trial and concluded he had not been insane at the time of the murders.

While awaiting trial, Speck participated in twice-weekly sessions with part-time Cook County Jail psychiatrist, Dr. Marvin Ziporyn. These continued after Speck&#x27;s transfer from Cermak Memorial Hospital (inside Chicago&#x27;s House of Corrections) on July 29, 1966, until February 13, 1967, the day before Speck was transferred to Peoria to stand trial. Ziporyn prepared a discharge summary with depression, anxiety, guilt, and shame among Speck&#x27;s emotions, but also a deep love for his family. It went on to note an obsessive-compulsive personality and a &quot;Madonna-prostitute&quot; attitude towards women. Ziporyn maintained Speck viewed women as saintly until he felt betrayed by them for some reason, after which hostility developed. Speck was also diagnosed with organic brain syndrome, resulting from cerebral injuries he had suffered earlier in his life, and stated he was competent to stand trial but was insane at the time of the crime due to the effects of alcohol and drug use on his organic brain syndrome.

Dr. Ziporyn did not testify for the defense or the prosecution, as both sides were troubled to learn before the trial that Ziporyn was writing a book about Speck for financial gain. Ziporyn also earned the ire of the Cook County Jail, which fired him as its part-time psychiatrist the week after Speck&#x27;s trial ended. At some point during his interviews with Speck, Ziporyn had obtained a written three-sentence consent from Speck authorizing him to tell &quot;what I am really like.&quot; Ziporyn&#x27;s biography of Speck was published in the summer of 1967.

==Confessions==

Speck later claimed he had no recollection of the murders, but he had confessed the crime to Dr. LeRoy Smith at the Cook County Hospital. Smith did not testify, because the confession was made while Speck was sedated. Illinois Supreme Court Justice John J. Stamos, Cook County&#x27;s state attorney when Speck was tried, who knew of the hospital confession, stated, &quot;...we didn&#x27;t need it. We had an eyewitness.&quot; Speck confessed to the murders for the first time in public when he spoke to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Bob Greene in 1978. In a film that inmates made at the Stateville Correctional Center in 1988, Speck recounted the brutal murders in detail. He again stated he was high that night, but then he undercut the idea that the drugs were a mitigating factor, asserting he could just as well have &quot;done it sober&quot;.

==Trial==
Speck&#x27;s jury trial began April 3, 1967, in Peoria, Illinois, three hours southwest of Chicago, with a gag order on the press. In court, Speck was positively identified by the sole surviving student nurse, Corazon Amurao. When Amurao was asked if she could identify the killer of her fellow students, Amurao rose from her seat in the witness box, walked directly in front of Speck and pointed her finger at him, nearly touching him, and said, &quot;This is the man.&quot;
In addition, Lieutenant Emil Giese testified that fingerprints at the scene had been matched to Richard Speck.

On April 15, after 49 minutes of deliberation, the jury found Speck guilty and recommended the death penalty. On June 5, Judge Herbert C. Paschen sentenced Speck to die in the electric chair, but granted an immediate stay pending automatic appeal. The Illinois Supreme Court subsequently upheld his conviction and death sentence on November 22, 1968.

==XYY syndrome myth==
In December 1965 and March 1966, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;The Lancet&quot; published findings by British cytogeneticist Patricia Jacobs and colleagues of a chromosome survey of patients at Scotland&#x27;s only security hospital for the developmentally disabled. Nine of the patients, ranging from to height, were found to have an extra Y chromosome, the XYY syndrome. Jacobs hypothesized that men with XYY syndrome are more prone to aggressive and violent behavior than males with the normal XY karyotype, but the idea was later shown to be incorrect.

In August 1966, Eric Engel, a Swiss endocrinologist and geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, wrote to Speck&#x27;s attorney, Cook County Public Defender Gerald W. Getty, who was reportedly planning an insanity defense. He suggested, based on Jacobs&#x27;s unsubstantiated theory and Speck&#x27;s height of , that Speck might have XYY syndrome. A chromosome analysis performed the following month by Engel revealed that Speck had a normal XY karyotype. One month later, a court-appointed panel of six physicians rejected Getty&#x27;s insanity argument and concluded that Speck was mentally competent to stand trial.

In 1968, biochemist Mary Telfer and associates published data from a genetic analysis, similar in design to Jacobs&#x27;s, of subjects confined in psychiatric hospitals and penal institutions in Pennsylvania. Of the five XYY patients identified, four exhibited moderate to severe facial acne, leading the group to suggest that acne be added to the list of defining XYY characteristics. Subsequent research failed to substantiate this observation as well.

After Getty contacted Telfer to discuss her findings and their possible relevance to his client, Telfer wrote a speculative piece for the British journal &quot;Think&quot; in which she mistakenly reported that Speck had an XYY karyotype. That, combined with his extensive acne scarring, led her to describe Speck as &quot;the archetypal XYY male&quot;.

In a three-part series on the XYY syndrome published in April 1968, &quot;The New York Times&quot; presented Jacobs&#x27;s unsubstantiated theory associating the syndrome with violent behavior as an established fact, and noted that the karyotype had been cited as a mitigating factor by attorneys defending an XYY man charged with murder in Paris, and another in Melbourne. It also identified Speck as a &quot;classic example&quot; of an &quot;XYY criminal&quot; and citing Telfer and Getty as sources, predicted that XYY syndrome would form the crux of his insanity defense. Similar articles followed, again citing Telfer, in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and six months later in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

In May 1968, Speck&#x27;s chromosomes were karyotyped a second time by Engel, with the same result: a normal 46,XY genome. After Speck&#x27;s conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court later that year and the appeals process moved to the Federal court system, articles continued to appear in the lay press reporting (or implying) that Speck&#x27;s supposed XYY genotype would be invoked as a mitigating factor.

In a review article published in the &quot;Journal of Medical Genetics&quot; in December 1968, Michael Court Brown found no overrepresentation of XYY males in chromosome surveys of Scottish prisons and hospitals for the developmentally and mentally disabled, and suggested that any conclusions drawn from study populations composed solely of institutionalized males were likely distorted by selection bias.

In May 1969, at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, Telfer &quot;et al.&quot; reported that they had found no evidence of significant behavior differences, on average, between men with XYY karyotypes and those with normal genomes, and that XYY males had been unfairly stigmatized by earlier unsupported speculation.

==Death penalty reversal==
On June 28, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court (citing their June 3, 1968 &quot;Witherspoon v. Illinois&quot; decision) upheld Speck&#x27;s conviction but reversed his death sentence, because more than 250 potential jurors were unconstitutionally excluded from his jury because of their conscientious or religious beliefs against capital punishment. The case was remanded back to the Illinois Supreme Court for re-sentencing.

On June 29, 1972, in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively declared the death penalty unconstitutional, so the Illinois Supreme Court&#x27;s only option was to order Speck re-sentenced to prison by the original Cook County court.

On November 21, 1972, in Peoria, Judge Richard Fitzgerald re-sentenced Speck to from 400 to 1,200 years in prison (eight consecutive sentences of 50 to 150 years), which was then reduced to 100 to 300 years. He was denied parole in seven minutes at his first parole hearing on September 15, 1976, and at six subsequent hearings in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 1987, and 1990.

==Imprisonment==
While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck was given the nickname &quot;Birdman&quot; after the film &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, because he kept a pair of sparrows that flew into his cell. He was described as a loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, a radio, and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as &quot;a big nothing doing time.&quot; Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine. Punishment for such infractions never stopped him. &quot;How am I going to get in trouble? I&#x27;m here for 1,200 years!&quot;

Speck loathed reporters, and granted only one press interview, in 1978, to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Bob Greene. During that interview, he publicly confessed to the murders for the first time, and said he thought he would get out of prison &quot;between now and the year 2000,&quot; at which time he hoped to run his own grocery store business. When Greene asked him if he compared himself to celebrity killers like John Dillinger, he replied, &quot;Me, I&#x27;m not like Dillinger or anybody else. I&#x27;m freakish.&quot;

Speck stated that at the time of the killings, he &quot;had no feelings,&quot; but things had changed: &quot;I had no feelings at all that night. They said there was blood all over the place. I can&#x27;t remember. It felt like nothing ... I&#x27;m sorry as hell. For those girls, and for their families, and for me. If I had to do it over again, it would be a simple house burglary.&quot; Speck&#x27;s &quot;final thought for the American people&quot; was, &quot;Just tell &#x27;em to keep up their hatred for me. I know it keeps up their morale. And I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.&quot;

In his book &quot;&quot;, John E. Douglas of the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Science Unit refers to a telling prison incident Speck revealed to him in an interview: &quot;he found an injured sparrow that had flown in through one of the broken windows and nursed it back to health. When it was healthy enough to stand, he tied a string around its leg and had it perch on his shoulder. At one point, a guard told him pets weren&#x27;t allowed. &#x27;I can&#x27;t have it?&#x27; Speck challenged, then walked over to a spinning fan and threw the small bird in. Horrified, the guard said, &#x27;I thought you liked that bird.&#x27; &#x27;I did,&#x27; Speck replied. &#x27;But if I can&#x27;t have it, no one can.&#x27;&quot; 

=== Prison video ===
In May 1996, Chicago television news anchor Bill Kurtis received video tapes made at Stateville Correctional Center in 1988 from an anonymous attorney. Showing them publicly for the first time before the Illinois state legislature, Kurtis pointed out the explicit scenes of sex, drug use, and money being passed around by prisoners, who seemingly had no fear of being caught. In the center was Speck, performing oral sex on an inmate, sharing a large quantity of cocaine with another inmate, parading in silk panties, sporting gynecomastia (allegedly grown using smuggled hormone treatments), and boasting: &quot;If they only knew how much fun I was having, they&#x27;d turn me loose.&quot; The Illinois legislature packed the auditorium to view the two-hour video, but stopped the screening when the tape showed Speck performing oral sex on another man.

From behind the camera, a prisoner asked Speck if he had killed the nurses. Speck responded: &quot;Sure I did.&quot; When asked why, Speck shrugged and jokingly said: &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t their night.&quot; Asked how he felt about himself in the years since, he said: &quot;Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you&#x27;re asking me if I felt sorry, no.&quot; He also described in detail the experience of strangling someone: &quot;It&#x27;s not like TV ... it takes over three minutes and you have to have a lot of strength.&quot;

==Death==
Shortly before December 5, 1991, Speck was transported from Stateville Correctional Center to Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet, Illinois after complaining of severe chest pains. Speck later died in the early morning hours of December 5, of what was believed to be a heart attack, one day shy of what would have been his 50th birthday. The coroner stated that Speck had an &quot;enlarged heart, emphysema and clogged arteries&quot; which most likely contributed to his fatal heart attack.

Speck&#x27;s sister feared that his grave would be desecrated, so he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in an undisclosed location in the Joliet area.

<doc id="700375" wikidata="Q1760117" url="?curid=700375" title="Saci (Brazilian folklore)">
<text>Saci ( ) is a character in Brazilian folklore. He is a one-legged black man, who smokes a pipe and wears a magical red cap that enables him to disappear and reappear wherever he wishes (usually in the middle of a dirt devil). Considered an annoying prankster in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he nevertheless grants wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However, his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell. Most people who claimed to have stolen this cap say they can never wash the smell away. In addition to having only one leg, Saci has a hole in both palms of his hands. A favorite pastime of Saci is passing a lit match through these holes. The legend says that a person can trap a Saci inside a bottle when he is in the form of a dust devil.

There are several variants of the myth, including: Saci-pererê (), black as coal; Saci-trique (), bi-racial and more benign; Saci-saçurá (), with red eyes.

==Powers, weaknesses, and habits==
An incorrigible prankster, the Saci causes no major harm, but there is no little harm that he won&#x27;t do. He hides children&#x27;s toys, sets farm animals loose, teases dogs—and curses chicken eggs, preventing them from hatching. In the kitchen, the Saci spills salt, sours the milk, burns the bean stew, and drops flies into the soup.

If a popcorn kernel fails to pop, it is because the Saci cursed it. Given half a chance, he dulls the seamstress&#x27;s needles, hides her thimbles, and tangles her sewing threads. If he sees a nail lying on the ground, he turns the point up. In short, people blame anything that goes wrong—in or outside the house—on the Saci.

Besides disappearing or becoming invisible (often with only his red cap and the red glow of his pipe still showing), the Saci can transform himself into a &quot;Matitaperê&quot; or &quot;Matita Pereira&quot;, an elusive bird whose melancholic song seems to come from nowhere. One can escape a pursuing Saci by crossing a water stream. The Saci dares not cross, for then he loses all his powers. Another way is to drop ropes full of knots. The Saci is compelled to stop and undo the knots. One can also try to appease him by leaving behind some cachaça, or some tobacco for his pipe.

He is fond of juggling embers or other small objects and letting them fall through the holes on his palms. An exceedingly nimble fellow, the lack of his right leg does not prevent him from bareback-riding a horse, and sitting cross-legged while puffing on his pipe (a feat comparable to the Headless Mule&#x27;s gushing fire from the nostrils).

Every dust devil, says the legend, is caused by the spin-dance of an invisible Saci. One can capture him by throwing into the dust devil a rosary made of separately blessed prayer beads, or by pouncing on it with a sieve. With care, the captured Saci can be coaxed to enter a dark glass bottle, where he can be imprisoned by a cork with a cross marked on it. He can also be enslaved by stealing his cap, which is the source of his power. However, depending on the treatment he gets from his master, an enslaved Saci who regains his freedom may become either a trustworthy guardian and friend, or a devious and terrible enemy.

==Origins of the legend==
While some claim that the Saci myth originated in Europe in the 13th century such as the monopod, it may derive from the &quot;Ŷaci-ŷaterê&quot; of Tupi-Guarani mythology, a magic one-legged child with bright red hair who would spell-bind people and break the forest&#x27;s silence with his loud shouts and whistles. He was originally a creature of the night, and indeed the &quot;ŷaci&quot; () means &quot;Moon&quot; in Old Tupi.

This indigenous character was appropriated and transformed in the 18th century by the African slaves who had been brought in large numbers to Brazil. Farm slaves would tell Saci stories to amuse and frighten the children. In this process the creature became black, his red hair metamorphosed into a red cap, and, as the African elders who usually told the tales, he came to be always smoking his clay-and-reed pipe. His name mutated into various forms, such as &quot;Saci Taperê&quot; and &quot;Sá Pereira&quot; (a common Portuguese name), and eventually &quot;Saci Pererê&quot;.

His red cap may have been inspired on the Trasgo, a mythical Portuguese creature with the exact same powers as the Saci. The Saci-Pererê concept shows some syncretism with Christian elements: he bolts away when faced with crosses, leaving behind a sulphurous smell – classical attributes of the devil in Christian folklore.

The concepts of imprisoning a supernatural being in a bottle by a magically marked cork, and of forcing him to grant wishes in return of his liberty, have obvious parallels in the story of Aladdin from the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. This may be more than just a coincidence, since some slaves were Muslims and thus presumably familiar with the Arabian tales. Moreover, the occupation of parts of the Portuguese territory (namely in the south) by the Muslim Moors, between the years 711 and 1249, provides another possible path for Arabian influence on the Saci legend.

==In popular culture==
* The character remains quite popular in present-day Brazilian urban culture, mainly due to the immensely popular children&#x27;s book &quot;O Saci&quot; by Monteiro Lobato (1932). Saci also has appearances in other films and TV series adaptations of &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot;.
* In the 1960s, the one-legged gnome – by now &quot;domesticated&quot; into a prankish but inoffensive and lovable creature – was chosen by premier Brazilian cartoonist Ziraldo as the leading character of his comics magazine &quot;Turma do Pererê&quot;. This original publication, the first of its genre to feature entirely &quot;national&quot; characters, was short-lived, but paved the way for other Brazilian cartoonists like Angeli, Laerte, and Mauricio de Sousa.
* The character also appears in manga &quot;Akuma-kun&quot; (1963–1964) of Shigeru Mizuki.
* Tom Jobim&#x27;s song &quot;Águas de Março&quot; mentions the &quot;Matinta Pereira&quot;, and Nei Lopes&#x27;s samba song entitled &quot;Fumo de Rolo&quot; tells a tale of a fisherman being accosted by the saci while collecting reeds in the forest. The Saci demands some tobacco for his pipe, but the poor fellow has lost his.
* Sport Club Internacional has the figure of Saci as its mascot, owing to the club&#x27;s popular roots, the red color of his clothing and the fans&#x27; hope that the team could pull tricks on their opponents. When Wason Rentería played for the club, in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, he would often celebrate his goals by doing an impersonation of Saci.
* With the purpose of countering the growing trend of adopting the Anglo-Celtic Halloween in Brazil (in Portuguese called &quot;Dia das Bruxas&quot;), the Day of the Saci was created in 2005, and it is likewise commemorated on October 31. A tongue-in-cheek Society of Saci Observers was also created.
* In the 2012 video game &quot;Max Payne 3&quot;, set mainly in São Paulo, Brazil, a trickster Saci makes a cameo as a villain in the in-game cartoon show &quot;The Adventures of Captain Baseball Bat Boy&quot;. In it Saci has his trademark pipe, red cap and shorts, and is missing his right leg. However, his skin is green.
* The Saci appears in &quot;AdventureQuest Worlds&quot;. This version has a human-like appearance, wields a spoon, and has a tornado where his legs should be while also performing wind attacks.
* The Saci appears in &quot;Invisible City&quot; (2021), played by Wesley Guimarães.
* In 2024, the indie horror game &quot;Saci: The Cursed Hunt&quot; by Marcos Silva reimagines Saci as a terrifying figure rooted in Brazilian folklore. Set in the Amazon rainforest, the game challenges players to survive his relentless pursuit.

==In science==
A novel species of dinosauromorph, discovered in 2001 at Agudo (southern Brazil), was named &quot;Sacisaurus&quot; because the fossil skeleton was missing one leg.

The names of the Brazilian satellites SACI-1 and SACI-2 were backronyms on the character&#x27;s name, as well as four retrotransposons in the DNA of the fluke &quot;Schistosoma mansoni&quot; were named Saci-1, Saci-2, Saci-3, and Perere, for their ability to jump around in the parasite&#x27;s genome.

Since the Saci&#x27;s one-legged physique reminds us of people with a physical disability, a social network named SACI (an acronym of &quot;Solidariedade, Apoio, Comunicação e Informação&quot;, meaning &quot;Solidarity, Support, Communication, and Information&quot;) was created at the University of São Paulo with the purpose of stimulating these four efforts towards the social and medical rehabilitation of physically disabled people.

==As a mascot==
Despite being a one-legged creature, the character is believed to be very agile and powerful, always defeating his enemies. As so, it&#x27;s a mascot of some sport clubs in Brazil such as Sport Club Internacional and Social Futebol Clube.

<text>The Ohio Company, formally known as the Ohio Company of Virginia, was a land speculation company organized for the settlement by Virginians of the Ohio Country (approximately the present U.S. state of Ohio) and to trade with the Native Americans. The company had a land grant from Britain and a treaty with Indians, but France also claimed the area, and the conflict helped provoke the outbreak of the French and Indian War.

==Formation==
Virginian explorers recognized the potential of the Ohio region for colonization and moved to capitalize on it, as well as to block French expansion into the territory. In 1748, Thomas Lee and brothers Lawrence and Augustine Washington organized the Ohio Company to represent the prospecting and trading interests of Virginian investors including Robert Dinwiddie; George Washington; George Mason; John Mercer (colonial lawyer) and sons George Mercer, James Mercer &amp; John Francis Mercer; Richard &quot;Squire&quot; Lee; Thomas Ludwell Lee; Phillip Ludwell Lee; Robert Carter III of Nomoni; John Tayloe II of Mount Airy; and Gawin Corbin, son of Henry Corbin (colonist).

In addition to the mandate and investment of Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie, other original members included John Hanbury, Colonel Thomas Cresap, George Mercer, John Mercer, and &quot;all of His Majesty&#x27;s Colony of Virginia.&quot; In that same year, George Mercer petitioned King George for land in the Ohio country, and in 1749, the British Crown granted the company 500,000 acres in the Ohio Valley between the Kanawha River and the Monongahela. The grant was in two parts: the first 200,000 acres were promised, and the following 300,000 acres were to be granted if the Ohio Company successfully settled one hundred families within seven years. Furthermore, the Ohio Company was required to construct a fort and provide a garrison to protect the settlement at their own expense. But the land grant was rent and tax free for ten years to facilitate settlement.

The organizers signed a treaty of friendship and permission at Logstown with the main tribes in the region in 1752 . A rival group of land speculators from Virginia, the Loyal Company of Virginia, was organized about the same time, and included influential Virginians such as Thomas Walker, William Cabell and Peter Jefferson (father of Thomas Jefferson).

In 1752 George Mason, later to become a major founding father, became treasurer of the Ohio Company, a post he held for forty years until his death in 1792.

==French and Indian War==
In 1748–1750, the Ohio Company hired Thomas Cresap, who had opened a series of trading posts along the Potomac River at Long Meadow, Oldtown and Will&#x27;s Creek (on the foot of the eastern climb up the Cumberland Narrows along what was soon to be called the Nemacolin Trail). Cresap contracted to blaze a small road over the Appalachian Mountains to the Monongahela River, and then to start widening this road into a wagon road. Though not known at the time, that route was one of only three mid-mountain-range crossings of the Appalachian Ridge and Valley system between the northern Hudson-Great Lakes route, and the southern Georgia-Mississippi-Western Tennessee plains route.

In 1750, the Ohio Company established a fortified storehouse at what became Ridgeley, Virginia across the Potomac River from the Will&#x27;s Creek trading post. That year the Ohio Company also hired Christopher Gist, a skillful woodsman and surveyor, to explore the Ohio Valley in order to identify lands for potential settlement. He surveyed and estimated the area drained by the Kanawha River as well as that drained by other tributaries of the Ohio River, and returned in 1751 and 1753. His journals provide valuable insights of the greater Ohio Valley as well as the Alleghenies. Gist travelled as far west as the Miami Indian village of Pickawillany (near present Piqua, Ohio). Relying on his report, the Ohio Company began selling land in what later became Western Pennsylvania and present-day West Virginia. Gist and Cresap both received sizable land grants west of the Appalachians. In 1752 the company had a pathway blazed between the small fortified posts at Wills Creek (that became Cumberland, Maryland), and Redstone Old Fort (that became Brownsville, Pennsylvania). Cresap and his scout Nemacolin had established the latter location in 1750, which overlooked Redstone Creek and the longstanding Monongahela River ford.

Conflicting land claims complicated settlement efforts. The Ohio Country tract ceded by the King through Virginia&#x27;s Governor Dinwiddie included, in Dinwiddie&#x27;s opinion, the &quot;forks of the Monongahela,&quot; present-day Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania colonial government also claimed much of this territory (though Maryland&#x27;s charter ended at the Appalachian divide, and while the charter of Virginia set no western boundary, Pennsylvania&#x27;s grant was for 5 degrees of longitude from the Delaware River, a SW point not determined until after the Mason Dixon survey). Moreover, France also claimed land in North America, including everything drained by the Mississippi River (the Ohio River being one of the great river&#x27;s tributaries). Not only did French traders compete with those of the Ohio Company and agents of other British-chartered entities, France had also sent soldiers, who were fighting for their kingdom&#x27;s right to occupy the Ohio Valley, most notably at Fort Duquesne. Dinwiddie responded by sending a military unit under the command of George Washington to the region, which led to the outbreak of the French and Indian War.

==Post-war efforts==
In 1763, the Ohio Company sent a representative to petition the British Crown for a grant renewal. The plans for settlement and military development continued, with Henry Bouquet&#x27;s 1764 plans to construct military posts around prospective western settlements. However, following Pontiac&#x27;s War, land claims west of the Appalachian Mountains were forfeited to the Native American tribes in the Proclamation of 1763, requiring them to be re-purchased through King George III.

==Grand Ohio Company==
In 1768, the British government authorized Sir William Johnson to make the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, purchasing land rights from the Iroquois, in accordance with the Proclamation of 1763. Samuel Wharton and William Trent applied for a &quot;despoiled traders&quot; (frontiersmen who had been aggrieved by the various Indian raids during and after the French and Indian Wars) land grant in 1768. In order to get approved by the British Crown, they joined with a number of other land speculators to form the Walpole Company, named for Thomas Walpole, a British lawyer involved in the endeavor. The company wanted to acquire 2.5 million acres of Ohio Country land. Pennsylvanian Benjamin Franklin was one of the seventy-two shareholders, as well as included Franklin&#x27;s son William (then Royal Governor of New Jersey), George Croghan and Sir William Johnson, as well as Franklin&#x27;s perennial London allies William Strahan and Richard Jackson. The Walpole Company, Indiana Company, and members of the Ohio Company reorganized, and on December 22, 1769, formed the Grand Ohio Company. In 1772, the Grand Ohio Company received from the British government a grant of a large tract lying along the southern bank of the Ohio as far west as the mouth of the Scioto River. A colony to be called &quot;Vandalia&quot; was planned. However, the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War interrupted colonization and nothing was accomplished. The London-based company ceased operations in 1776.

The Ohio Company of Associates was organized in 1786, composed largely of New England veterans who had certificates for land from Congress for their services during the Revolution.

<text>The Mud Islands reserve is located within Port Phillip, about south-west of Melbourne, Australia, lying inside Port Phillip Heads, north of Portsea and east of Queenscliff. The land area of about is made up of three low-lying islands surrounding a shallow tidal lagoon connected to the sea by three narrow channels. The shapes and configuration of the islands change over the years due to movement of sand by tidal currents.

==History==
Acting Lieutenant John Murray discovered the islands in February 1802 while surveying the Port Phillip shoreline. Murray&#x27;s party observed numerous swans and pelicans on the islands, which prompted him to name the group &quot;Swan Isles&quot;. At first sight, large guano deposits made the islands appear to be rocky outcrops, and Murray&#x27;s inaccurate sketch of the islands demonstrates that they were not surveyed by his party. Over the next 140 years, the islands were periodically visited by individuals such as fishermen and guano-diggers, and Lieutenants T.M. Symonds and H.R. Henry of surveyed the islands in 1836 and renamed them &quot;Mud Islands&quot;. However, the first careful scientific study of the islands was not made until 1945.

===Protection===
In 1961, the Victorian Fisheries and Wildlife Department declared the islands a sanctuary for the white-faced storm petrel. In 1979, the area of the islands above high water was proclaimed a permanent reserve for the management of wildlife. It forms part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site, which was designated in, as a wetland of international importance, and it is also included on the Register of the National Estate. Since 2002 it has been, with the adjacent waters, part of the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park.

==Environment==

===Flora===
Within the reserve there are nine native vegetation communities. Seagrass meadows, sand dunes, mudflats and salt marshes support a diversity of life ranging from marine invertebrates to fish and birds. Wind and tide are gradually changing the shape of the islands, although they are partly stabilised by a salt marsh of austral sea-blite and beaded and shrubby glasswort. The dense coastal scrub on the northern island has disappeared, apparently as a result of overgrazing by rabbits. Today only a single specimen of coastal teatree (&quot;Leptospermum laevigatum&quot;) remains.

===Fauna===
The site is part of the Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International. Some 70 species of birds have been recorded on the Islands, which form essential breeding, feeding and roosting areas for seabirds and waders, many of them migratory.

====Seabirds====
The isolation of the islands provides protection from predators and makes them an ideal sanctuary for breeding seabirds, notably the five and a half thousand white-faced storm-petrels which, during summer, lay their eggs in burrows in the loose sand of Middle Island. During the day they feed at sea on shrimps and small fish, returning at night to feed their chicks. Although there are fewer than at nearby South Channel Fort, nearly a quarter of the white-faced storm-petrels in Victoria breed on Mud Islands.

Silver gulls are even more numerous. During the second half of the 20th century the breeding population increased to about 100,000. Given a chance, gulls readily attack the eggs and young of other breeding seabirds. The impact is under study.

Other seabirds nesting on Mud Islands include nearly a thousand crested terns, one of the largest colonies in Victoria and the only one in Port Phillip. Also important to the islands are the dozen breeding pairs of Caspian terns and, in 1983 and 1986, several pairs of Australian pelicans. Little penguins and fairy terns have bred there in the past. The common tern also roosts in exceptionally large numbers and as many as 260 have been seen there at once.

====Waders====
The mud from which the islands get their name is excellent feeding habitat for migratory waders. More than 1% of the known Australian populations of four wader species, Pacific golden plover, grey plover, lesser sand plover and ruddy turnstone, spend the summer around Mud Islands. More than 5% of the Victorian populations of red knot, great knot, eastern curlew and bar-tailed godwit feed in Swan Bay to the west but roost on the islands at high tide. Two resident waders, the pied oystercatcher and the red-capped plover, regularly breed on undisturbed parts of the islands.

====Other====
Few land birds are permanently resident, although many species visit and may breed. Large numbers of straw-necked ibis and, to a lesser extent, Australian white ibis, nest and roost on the islands and fly daily to the mainland for feeding. Lewin&#x27;s rail occasionally breeds in the salt marsh but is so shy that nesting is seldom recorded. Up to 100 rare orange-bellied parrots have been seen on the islands during winter when they migrate to the Australian mainland from Tasmania. Since the mid-20th century, however, numbers have declined, possibly because the increasing number of gulls has changed the chemistry of the soil and so the vegetation on which the parrots feed. Nevertheless, the islands are an important habitat for this endangered species. Bronze whaler sharks are known to breed around the islands.

==Access==
The islands can only be reached by boat, the most convenient departure points being Queenscliff or Sorrento. Day visitors are permitted, but overnight camping is not. BirdLife Australia conduct regular tours to Mud Islands, usually in February and March. South Bay Eco Adventures also run guided walking tours of the islands. As the islands are surrounded by shallow waters, visitors need to be cautious when attempting a landing. Passengers must be ferried to shore by dinghy or else wade in. Visits need careful planning to avoid the boat being stranded at low tide.

<text>The Ohio Company of Associates, also known as the Ohio Company, was a land company whose members are today credited with becoming the first non-Native American group to permanently settle west of the Allegheny mountains. In 1788 they established Marietta, Ohio, as the first permanent settlement of the new United States in the newly organized Northwest Territory.

==Creation of the company==
The company was formed between March 1 and March 3, 1786, by Rufus Putnam, Benjamin Tupper, Samuel Holden Parsons and Manasseh Cutler in Boston, Massachusetts. They had met at The Bunch-of-Grapes tavern, located on King Street, to discuss the settlement of the territory around the Ohio River. On March 8, 1787, Parsons, Putnam, and Cutler were chosen as directors, and Winthrop Sargent was elected secretary. On August 30, 1787, James Mitchell Varnum was elected as a director, and Richard Platt as treasurer. Later directors included Griffin Greene upon the death of Varnum, and Robert Oliver upon the death of Parsons.

==Negotiations with the government==
Cutler was sent to New York to negotiate with the Congress of the Confederation to help the company secure a claim on a portion of the land. While there, Cutler aligned himself with William Duer, secretary of the U.S. Treasury Board. Duer and his associates formed a group of New York speculators who were determined to see settlement of the area west of the Appalachians. At this time, Congress desperately needed revenue. The prospect of sales of land helped settle controversy and secure the incorporation in the Northwest Ordinance of the paragraphs that prohibited slavery, provided for land for public education and for the support of the ministry.

The Ohio Company&#x27;s purchase was enabled first by the passage on July 13, 1787, of the &quot;Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio,&quot; commonly known as the Northwest Ordinance, and second, by the Act of October 23, 1787, which authorized Congress to make contracts of public lands for not less than one million acres. On October 27, 1787, the Treasury Board under Secretary William Duer finalized the Ohio Company&#x27;s purchase. Their first contract was for the Ohio Company to purchase 1,500,000 acres (6,000 km²) of land at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers, from a point near the site of present-day Marietta, to a point nearly opposite present-day Huntington, West Virginia, for a payment of $1 million in government securities, then worth about 12¢ specie to the dollar. The contract also provided that one section of land in every township be devoted to the maintenance of public schools, another section be set apart for religious uses, and two entire townships be reserved for a university.
The second contract was an option to buy all the land between the Ohio and the Scioto rivers and the western boundary line of the Ohio Company&#x27;s tract, extending north of the tenth survey township from the Ohio, this tract being preempted by Manasseh Cutler and Winthrop Sargent for themselves and others for the Scioto Company. Cutler&#x27;s original intent was to buy only about 1,500,000 acres (6,000 km²) for the Ohio Company, but on the July 27, Congress authorized a grant of about 5,000,000 acres (20,000 km²) of land for $3,500,000; a reduction of one-third was allowed for bad tracts, and it was also provided that the lands could be paid for in United States securities. On the same day, Cutler and Sargent for themselves and associates transferred to William Duer, then Secretary of the Treasury Board, and his associates one equal moiety of the Scioto tract of land mentioned in the second contract. Both parties were to be equally interested in the sale of the land, and were to share equally any profit or loss. But the Scioto Company interest was speculative, and their contract lapsed before they purchased any land. In contrast, the Ohio Company had a genuine plan of settlement.

The company made its first installment of $500,000, but was unable to raise the second $500,000. It settled for a purchase of , plus the two townships for College Lands and the reserved School Lands and Ministerial Lands sections in each township, for a total area of , called the First Purchase. The lands were privately surveyed, but on the same plan of townships, ranges, and sections as the adjacent Seven Ranges under the procedure of the Land Ordinance of 1785.

==Settlement at Marietta, Ohio==
In 1788, General Rufus Putnam laid out the plans for Marietta, the first permanent settlement in the present state of Ohio. The Ohio Company sent pioneers from New England to the Northwest Territory. Their first purchase was in Washington, Meigs, Gallia, Lawrence and Athens counties.

Difficulties with Native Americans during the Northwest Indian War, including the Big Bottom Massacre, led Congress in 1792 to donate on the north edge of the first purchase as a buffer against incursion. The Donation Tract incorporated much of present-day Washington and Morgan counties. Many associates of the company held army bounty warrants, which they could exchange for federal land, totaling .

Later in 1792, the Ohio Company purchased another in Morgan, Hocking, Vinton and Athens counties, using these bounties, with the 1/3 discount for bad lands, as in the first purchase. The Second Purchase had no sections set aside for schools or ministry. The Second Purchase is also known as the Purchase on the Muskingum.

In 1796, the Ohio Company divided its shares and ceased to be a genuine land company.

<doc id="700400" wikidata="Q1234469" url="?curid=700400" title="Ramón Emeterio Betances">
<text>Ramón Emeterio Betances y Alacán (April 8, 1827 – September 16, 1898) was a Puerto Rican independence advocate and medical doctor. He was the primary instigator of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; revolt and designer of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; flag. Since the &quot;Grito&quot; galvanized a burgeoning nationalist movement among Puerto Ricans, Betances is also considered to be the father of the Puerto Rican independence movement and the &quot;El&quot; &quot;Padre de la Patria (The Father of the Homeland)&quot;. His charitable deeds for people in need, earned him the moniker of &quot;El Padre de los Pobres (The Father of the Poor)&quot;.

Betances was also a medical doctor and surgeon in Puerto Rico, and one of its first social hygienists. He had established a successful surgery and ophthalmology practice. Betances was also an abolitionist, diplomat, public health administrator, poet, and novelist. He served as representative and contact for Cuba and the Dominican Republic in Paris.

An adherent of Freemasonry, his political and social activism was deeply influenced by the group&#x27;s philosophical beliefs.

==Early years==

===Ancestry===
Betances was born in Cabo Rojo Puerto Rico in the building that now houses the &quot;Logia Cuna de Betances&quot; (&quot;Betances&#x27; Cradle Masonic Lodge&quot;). Betances&#x27; parents were Felipe Betanzos Ponce, a merchant born in Hispaniola (in the part that would later become the Dominican Republic; the surname Betanzos transformed into Betances while the family resided there), and María del Carmen Alacán de Montalvo, a native of Cabo Rojo and of French ancestry. They were married later.

Betances claimed in his lifetime that a relative of his, Pedro Betances, had revolted against the Spanish government of Hispaniola in 1808 and was tortured, executed, and his body burned and shown to the populace to dissuade them from further attempts. Meanwhile, Alacán&#x27;s father, a sailor, led a party of volunteers that tried to apprehend the pirate Roberto Cofresí y Ramírez de Arellano in 1824 and did arrest some of Cofresí&#x27;s crew, for which he was honored by the Spanish government.

Betances was the fourth of six children; the oldest of which would die shortly after birth; Betances was the only male among the surviving siblings. The family was described as being of mixed race in records of the day. His mother died in 1837, when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 1839; the five children he had with María del Carmen Torres Pagán included Ramón&#x27;s half-brother Felipe Adolfo, who was not involved in politics (according to Ramón) but was nevertheless arrested following the Grito de Lares years later.

His father eventually bought the Hacienda Carmen in what would later become the nearby town of Hormigueros, and became a wealthy landowner. He owned of land, a small sugar mill, and some slaves, who shared their duties with free workers. There is speculation that he later freed his slaves, persuaded by his son Ramón.

===First years in France===

====Primary education====
The young Betances received his primary education from private tutors contracted by his father, a Freemason who owned the largest private library in town. His parents&#x27; attitude towards religion and civil authority shaped his personal beliefs in both subjects. His father would eventually send him to France, to study at the then-named &quot;Collège Royal&quot; (later named the Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat) in Toulouse when he was ten years old. A Franco-Puerto Rican family, Jacques Maurice Prévost and María Cavalliery Bey (who also was a native of Cabo Rojo) were appointed as his tutors. Prévost opened a drug store in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, but was forced to return to France (particularly to his native town, Grisolles) for not having finished his pharmacy studies. There is also speculation that Prévost was a Freemason, as was Betances&#x27; father.

Betances accompanied the couple in Prévost&#x27;s return to his country, and would be under their indirect tutelage while boarding at the school. He showed interest in natural and exact sciences early on, and also became a good fencer.

====Legal &quot;whitening&quot; of family====
While Ramón was in France, his father sought to move the family&#x27;s registration from the &quot;mixed race&quot; to the &quot;white&quot; (Caucasian) classification of families in Cabo Rojo. The process, when successful, entitled the requester to further legal and property rights for him and his family, and was necessary to allow his daughter, Ana María, to marry José Tió, who was a Caucasian. In the case of Betances&#x27; father, the process lasted two years, and was formalized in 1840, but not before having to have the family&#x27;s lineage and religious affiliations exposed to the general public, something that embarrassed them all. Betances was considerably annoyed by the entire ordeal, since he was the first to acknowledge that he and his entire family were not &quot;blancuzcos&quot; (&quot;whitish&quot;, a legal term) but &quot;prietuzcos&quot; (&quot;blackish&quot;, as Betances mocked it in his letters) instead. To him the procedure reeked of hypocrisy.

====Medicine studies====
In 1846, Betances obtained his &quot;baccalauréat&quot; (high school diploma). After an extended vacation in Puerto Rico, he went on to study medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris from 1848 until 1855, with a short interlude at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier for specific courses in the summer of 1852.

At the time of his arrival in Paris, Betances witnessed the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution and its backlash, the June Days Uprising, earlier that year. His future political views were directly shaped by what he saw and experienced at the time. He himself &quot;an old soldier of the French Republic&quot;. Inspired by the proclamation of the 2 République, he rejected Puerto Rican aspirations for autonomy (sought from Spain by Puerto Rican politicians since 1810) in favor of Puerto Rican independence.

In 1856, he graduated with the titles of Doctor in Medicine and Surgeon. He was the second Puerto Rican to graduate from the University (after Pedro Gerónimo Goyco, a later political leader native of Mayagüez who would eventually interact with Betances when both returned to Puerto Rico). Among Betances&#x27; teachers were: Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, Jean Cruveilhier, Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud, Armand Trousseau, Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau and Auguste Nélaton.

====Father&#x27;s death and family&#x27;s economic problems====
While Betances was studying medicine in France, his father died (in August 1854) and his sister Ana María would be forced to take over the Hacienda Carmen&#x27;s management. By 1857 the heirs were forced to give the operation&#x27;s output to a holding company headed by Guillermo Schröeder.

==First return to Puerto Rico==

===Cholera epidemic of 1856===
Betances returned to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic made its way to Puerto Rico&#x27;s western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would have to take care of 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.

An emergency subscription fund was established by some of the city&#x27;s wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city&#x27;s unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the &quot;Hospital San Antonio&quot;, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances&#x27; stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would have to take care of the entire operation on his own temporarily.

At the time, he had his first confrontation with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city&#x27;s government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, in favor of a Spanish newcomer.

Basora and Betances were eventually honored with streets named after each in the city of Mayagüez. The main thoroughfare that crosses the city from north to south is named after Betances; a street that links the center of the city with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez is named after Dr. Basora.

==Exile from and return to Puerto Rico==
===Abolitionist===
Betances believed in the abolition of slavery, inspired not only on written works by Victor Schœlcher, John Brown, Lamartine and Tapia, but also on personal experience, based on what he saw at his father&#x27;s farm and in daily Puerto Rican life. Based on his beliefs, he founded a civic organization in 1856, one of many others that were later called the &quot;Secret Abolitionist Societies&quot; by historians. Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature, but Betances and Salvador Brau (a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico) describe them in their writings. Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom.

The objective of the particular society Betances founded was to free children who were slaves, taking advantage of their need to receive the sacrament of Baptism at the town church, &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria&quot;, which is now the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Mayagüez. Since buying the freedom of slave children cost 50 &quot;pesos&quot; if the child had been baptized, and 25 &quot;pesos&quot; if the child had not, Betances, Basora, Segundo Ruiz Belvis and other members of the society waited next to the baptismal font on Sundays, expecting a master to take a slave family to baptize their child. Before the child was baptized, Betances or his partners gave money to the parents, which they in turn used to buy the child&#x27;s freedom from his master. The child, once freed, was baptized minutes after. This action was later described as having the child receive the &quot;aguas de libertad&quot; (waters of liberty). Similar events occurred in the city of Ponce.

The baptismal font where these baptisms were performed still exists, and is owned by a local family of merchants, the Del Moral family, who keep it at their Mayagüez house.

As of 2007 the baptismal font has been donated to the Mayagüez Cathedral, Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, by Doña Elda Del Moral. It had been in conservation from 1963 until donated.

===&quot;La vierge de Boriquén&quot; (The &quot;Boriquén&quot; Virgin)===
The Spanish governor of Puerto Rico, Fernando Cotoner, threatened Betances with exile in 1858 because of his abolitionist tactics. Betances took a leave of absence from his duties as director of the local hospital and again left Puerto Rico for France, followed by Basora. Soon, his half-sister Clara and her husband, Justine Hénri, would also leave for Paris with his niece, María del Carmen Hénri.

María del Carmen, nicknamed &quot;Lita&quot;, was born in 1838. She had met Betances when she was 10, and Betances became instantly fond of her. Once he returned to Puerto Rico from his medical studies he requested the necessary ecclesiastical permissions to marry her (due to the degree of consanguinity between them), which were granted in Rome (then part of the Papal States) after an extended delay. Their marriage was supposed to occur on May 5, 1859, in Paris, but Lita fell sick with typhus and died at the Mennecy house of Dr. Pierre Lamire, a friend from Betances&#x27; medical school days, on April 22, 1859 (the Good Friday of that year).

Betances was psychologically devastated by Lita&#x27;s death. Accompanied by his sister, brother-in-law, local friends and a few Puerto Rican friends residing in Paris at the time (which included Basora, Francisco Oller and another Cabo Rojo native, future political leader Salvador Carbonell), Betances had Lita buried on April 25. Her body was later reburied in Mayagüez, on November 13 of that year. Salvador Brau, a historian and close friend, later wrote that once Betances returned to Puerto Rico with Lita&#x27;s body, he suspended all personal activities besides his medical work, spent a considerable amount of time caring for her tomb at the Mayagüez cemetery, and assumed the physical aspect that most people identify Betances with: dark suit, long unkempt beard, and &quot;Quaker hat.&quot;

Betances immersed himself in work, but later found time to write a short story in French, &quot;La Vierge de Boriquén&quot; (The Boriquén Virgin), inspired in his love for Lita and her later death, and somewhat influenced by Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s writing style. Cayetano Coll y Toste later described the story of Lita and Betances in the story La Novia de Betances,

===Return to Mayagüez and second exile===

====Doctor and surgeon====
After returning to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established a very successful surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the &quot;Emulsión de Scott&quot; (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.

Betances introduced new surgical and aseptic procedures to Puerto Rico. With the assistance of Venezuelan anesthesiologist Pedro Arroyo, Betances performed the first ever surgical procedure under chloroform in Puerto Rico, in November 1862.

At the same time he spent a considerable amount of time serving Mayagüez&#x27;s disadvantaged on a pro bono basis. He gave many donations to the poor, and because of this he became known as &quot;The Father of the Poor&quot; among &quot;Mayagüezanos&quot; according to his contemporary, Eugenio María de Hostos.

====Exile in the Dominican Republic====
The Dominican Republic had its second war for independence in 1844, which was successful in obtaining independence from Haiti. Spain reannexed the country at the request of its then-dictator, Gen. Pedro Santana (who attempted to benefit personally from the event), in 1861. A third revolt, the &quot;War of Restoration&quot;, sought independence from the Spanish in 1863. Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in the occupied territories, and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.

At the same time, the Spanish government, which ruled over Puerto Rico, attempted to banish Betances for a second time, but he and Segundo Ruiz Belvis (a lawyer and city administrator who became his closest friend and political companion) fled the island before they were apprehended. Both fled to the northern city of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic in 1861, where Betances established a close personal friendship with Gen. Gregorio Luperón, the military leader of the northern pro-independence faction who led the efforts to restore Dominican sovereignty over their country. Betances was also a collaborator of Dominican priest (and later Archbishop of Santo Domingo and one-time president of the country), Fernando Arturo de Meriño, who was the revolt&#x27;s ideological leader (as well as its delegate in Puerto Rico when he was himself exiled by the restored republican government). These two friendships would prove to be key to Betances&#x27; own efforts to achieve Puerto Rican independence later on.

The volatility of the Dominican situation was severe at the time: Luperón fought a guerrilla war against the Spanish and Santana and became vice-president of the country (in 1863), only to be exiled to Saint Thomas because of his opposition to president Buenaventura Báez&#x27; wishes to annex the country to the United States (in 1864), to later return, provoke a coup d&#x27;état and be part of a three-way presidency (1866), only to be exiled once again (1868). Whenever Luperón was in the Dominican Republic, Betances could use it as a base of operations for his later political and military objectives, while offering Luperón logistical and financial assistance in return.

Since Betances&#x27; exile depended on who was governing Puerto Rico at the time, a change in government allowed him to return to Mayagüez in 1862. However, a few years later, (1868) Luperón and Betances would both end up exiled in Saint Thomas.

====Second return to Mayagüez====
After returning to Puerto Rico, Betances and Ruiz proposed the establishment of a municipal hospital to take care of the city&#x27;s poor. The hospital, named &quot;Hospital San Antonio&quot;, opened on January 18, 1865, with subscription funds and an assignment from the Spanish local government. The &quot;Hospital San Antonio&quot; is now an obstetrics and pediatrics hospital in the city.

Ruiz was a Freemason who invited Betances to join his lodge, the &quot;Logia Unión Germana&quot; in nearby San Germán. They both founded (or revived, depending on the source) the &quot;Logia Yagüez&quot;, so as to have a local lodge in Mayagüez. Based on his Masonic beliefs, Ruiz also attempted to establish a university in the city, for which he mortgaged his house. However, the Spanish government actively discouraged the founding of secondary education institutions in Puerto Rico (so as not to have &quot;seedlings for revolt&quot; come out of them), and the project was canceled.

====Simplicia Jiménez====
Betances met his lifelong companion, Simplicia Isolina Jiménez Carlo, in 1864. Jiménez apparently was born in what would later become the Dominican Republic, on July 28, 1842. Her mother&#x27;s last name, Carlo, rather common in Cabo Rojo, implies that her family had ties to the town. She worked for one of Betances&#x27; sisters between 1863 and 1864, and he met her once at his sister&#x27;s house. Apparently she was infatuated with him strongly enough to appear at his door with a pair of suitcases, asking him to give her shelter, since &quot;no gentleman would leave a woman alone on the street at night.&quot; Jiménez then became Betances&#x27; common-law wife for thirty-five years, and survived his death in 1898. They would not have any children. Their godchild, Magdalena Caraguel, was eventually adopted by the couple as their daughter. Little else is documented about Jiménez in history books, and Betances rarely mentions her in his works and correspondence.

While still living in Mayagüez, Betances built a house for himself and his wife, which they only lived in for less than two years; the house, named the &quot;Casa de los Cinco Arcos&quot; (House of the Five Arches), still stands on the street that bears his name near the corner with Luis Muñoz Rivera street, south of the city&#x27;s center.

===&quot;Padre de la Patria&quot; (Father of the Puerto Rican Nation)===

====Seeds for revolt in Puerto Rico====
The Spanish government was involved in several conflicts across Latin America: war with the Dominican Republic, Peru and Chile (see below), slave revolts in Cuba, a bad economic situation in its colonies, among others. It attempted to appease the growing discontent of the citizens of its remaining colonies in the continent by setting up a board of review that would receive complaints from representatives of the colonies and attempt to adjust legislation that affected them. This board, the &quot;Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar&quot; (Overseas Informative Reform Board) would be formed by representatives of each colony, in proportion to their collective population, and would meet in Madrid. The Junta would report to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emilio Castelar.

The Puerto Rican delegation was freely elected by those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), in a rare exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis was elected to the Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta&#x27;s arguments.

However, beyond abolition, proposals for autonomy were voted down, as were other petitions to limit the unlimited power the governor general would have upon virtually all aspects of life in Puerto Rico. Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico, they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in Carolina, Puerto Rico, in early 1865. Betances was invited by Ruiz and did attend. After listening to the Junta members&#x27; list of voted-down measures, Betances stood up and retorted: &quot;Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene&quot; (No one can give others what they don&#x27;t have for themselves), a phrase that he would constantly use through the rest of his life when referring to Spain&#x27;s unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms. He would then suggest setting up a revolt and proclaim independence as soon as possible. Many of the meeting&#x27;s attendants sided with Betances, to the horror of Acosta.

====Organizer of the Grito de Lares====
In late June 1867 Betances and at least 12 more potential &quot;revolutionaries&quot; were exiled from Puerto Rico by then governor Gen. José María Marchessi y Oleaga as a preventive measure, including Goyco and Ruiz. A battalion of local soldiers had revolted in San Juan earlier, protesting about their poor pay, compared to that of their Spanish counterparts living in Puerto Rico. Betances later stated that the revolt (called the &quot;Motín de Artilleros&quot; by historians) was unrelated to his revolutionary plans, and that he actually did not mind the troops stationed in Puerto Rico that much, since they would have been ill-prepared for stopping a well-developed pro-independence revolt at the time anyway. Marchesi feared that the United States, which had made an offer to purchase what were then the Danish Virgin Islands, would rather instigate a revolt in Puerto Rico so as to later annex the island—which would make a better military base in the Caribbean—at a lesser economic cost. His fears were not without base, since the then American consul in the island, Alexander Jourdan, suggested precisely this to then Secretary of State William H. Seward, but only after the expulsions (September 1867).

Some of the expelled (such as Carlos Elías Lacroix and José Celis Aguilera) set up camp in Saint Thomas. Betances and Ruiz, on the other hand, left for New York—where Basora had previously gone—soon after. They soon founded the &quot;Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico&quot;, along with other Puerto Ricans living in the city. After signing a letter that could serve as proof of his intentions of becoming a United States citizen (mainly to prevent his arrest elsewhere) Betances then returned to the Dominican Republic in September 1867, where he attempted to organize an armed expedition that was to invade Puerto Rico. However, under threat of arrest by Buenaventura Báez—who saw Betances as siding with his enemies and wanted him executed—Betances took asylum at the United States embassy in Santo Domingo, and headed for Charlotte Amalie soon after.

====The Ten Commandments of Free Men====
Betances was responsible for numerous proclamations that attempted to arouse Puerto Rican nationalistic sentiment, written between 1861 and his death. The most famous of these is &quot;Los Diez Mandamientos de los hombres libres&quot; (The Ten Commandments of Free Men), written in exile in Saint Thomas in November 1867. It is directly based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted by France&#x27;s National Assembly in 1789, which contained the principles that inspired the French Revolution.

====The &quot;Grito&quot; and its aftermath====
Meanwhile, Ruiz Belvis, who headed the Committee, was supposed to gather financial support for the incoming Puerto Rican revolution through a tour of South America. He had received an invitation from Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna, a Chilean diplomat, to coordinate a common front against Spanish interests in all of Latin America (Spain was still threatening Chile after the Chincha Islands War, and any revolution in the Caribbean would have been a welcome distraction). Vicuña promised to gather necessary support in Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela to help the Puerto Rican independence cause.

However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile soon after his arrival in the country. He reportedly had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz&#x27;s brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out of what he had described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz&#x27;s life.

Betances was shaken psychologically by news of Ruiz&#x27;s death, and by another event soon after; while Betances and his wife were in Saint Thomas on November 18, 1867, they experienced the Virgin Islands earthquake and tsunami. According to a letter he wrote, he and his wife vacated the building just before it collapsed, and were forced to live in a camp while aftershocks kept shaking the island for close to a month.

Gregorio Luperón met Betances in Saint Thomas, and offered to assist the Puerto Rican revolution, in exchange for help to overthrow Báez once the right circumstances were met. As a consequence, Betances organized revolutionary cells in Puerto Rico from exile, which would be led by leaders such as Manuel Rojas and Mathias Brugman. Betances instructed Mariana Bracetti to knit a flag for the revolution using the colors and basic design similar to that of the Dominican Republic (which in turn was almost identical to a French military standard). Betances was also supposed to send reinforcements to the Puerto Rican rebels through the use of a ship purchased by Puerto Rican and Dominican revolutionaries, &quot;El Telégrafo&quot; (which was to be shared by both), but the ship was confiscated soon after arrival by the government of the then Danish (later United States) Virgin Islands.

Eventually all these factors led the way to the abortive insurrection known as the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot;, whose date had to be brought forward to September 23, 1868. The &quot;Grito&quot; found Betances between Curaçao and Saint Thomas, struggling to send reinforcements in time for the revolt.

After the failed insurrection, Betances did not return to Puerto Rico, except for &quot;secret&quot; visits, according to the obituary written about him by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; after his death. There is no evidence of these, although Betances suggests a visit did occur at some time between 1867 and 1869, and perhaps again in the 1880s.

====In New York====
Betances fled to New York City in April 1869, where he again joined Basora in his efforts to organize Puerto Rican revolutionaries into additional activities leading to independence. He joined the Cuban Revolutionary Junta, whose members were more successful at their drive for armed revolution for Cuba, which had started with the &quot;Grito de Yara&quot;, just two weeks after the Grito de Lares. He also lobbied the United States Congress successfully against an annexation of the Dominican Republic by the United States, requested in a vote by a majority of voters in a referendum in 1869. He also befriended Venezuelan military leader and former president José Antonio Páez in his final days. Betances stayed in New York from April 1869 through February 1870.

====In Hispaniola====
Somewhat disillusioned by his experience in New York City (he had philosophical differences with some leaders of the Antillean liberation movements, particularly with Eugenio María de Hostos), Betances spent a short interlude in Jacmel, Haiti in 1870 at the request of its then-president, Jean Nissage-Saget, who supported Betances&#x27; efforts to have a liberal government for the Dominican Republic take power. He later spent some time in the Cibao valley (in both Santiago de los Caballeros and Puerto Plata) where Luperón and Betances attempted to organize another revolt, this time against conservative elements in the Dominican Republic.

While in New York, Betances wrote and translated numerous political treatises, proclamations and works that were published in the newspaper &quot;La Revolución&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;El Antillano&quot; (The Antillean One). He was vehement about the need for natives of the Greater Antilles to unite into an Antillean Confederation, a regional entity that would seek to preserve the sovereignty and well-being of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

Betances also promoted direct intervention of Puerto Ricans in the Cuban independence struggle, which eventually happened in the Cuban War of Independence (1895–98). Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico, and the local political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time. Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti to the Cuban rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as a priority.

Betances admired the United States of America for its ideals of freedom and democracy, but despised Manifest Destiny and the Monroe Doctrine, and sensed that both philosophies were being used as excuses for American interventions on the continent. When Cuban revolutionaries requested help from the United States for reinforcing their armed struggle against Spain, Betances warned them against giving too much away. He feared American interventionism in the affairs of a free Cuba, and vehemently attacked Cuban leaders who suggested the annexation of Cuba by the United States. Some of his fears became reality years later, when the Platt Amendment became a &quot;de facto&quot; part of the Cuban constitution (1901).

==Return to France==
Expecting to bring some stability to his personal life, Betances had Simplicia Jiménez meet him again in Haiti (she had been living in St. Croix since he was evicted from Saint Thomas, to ensure her safety), and returned with her to Paris where he continued to fight for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence for close to 26 years. He established his medical office at &quot;6(bis), Rue de Châteaudun&quot; (), four streets away from the city&#x27;s Palais Garnier.

One of the events that gave Betances great satisfaction was the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico, which was made official on March 22, 1873. He reminded people that abolition would not have happened without the direct intervention of Puerto Ricans in the Spanish political process, and was thus hopeful that the islanders would assume a more proactive role in seeking their freedom from Spain. With time, Betances became essentially the representative of the liberal governments of the Dominican Republic for as long as they lasted, and the representative of the Cuban &quot;government in arms&quot;, or insurrection.

===Diplomatic and revolutionary activities===

====Diplomat for the Dominican Republic====
Soon after his return to France, Betances became the first secretary to the Dominican Republic&#x27;s diplomatic mission to France, but virtually assumed the role of ambassador. He also became the commercial representative of the Dominican government in Paris, Bern and London. At one time Betances attempted to be a venture capital partner on a failed enterprise that attempted to commercialize the use of Samaná Bay to benefit the Dominican Republic, and also to prevent foreign interests (particularly the United States) from taking over the bay, which was considered a primary strategic geographical feature of Hispaniola, in both commercial and military terms.

Luperón would eventually arrive in Paris as a named ambassador, but Betances&#x27; connections in the city proved to be key to whatever success Luperón had as a diplomat in France. They would assume this role until political turmoil in the Dominican Republic forced Luperón to return and lead yet another revolt, which had another Puerto Plata native, Ulises Heureaux, installed as president. Betances sought support for Luperón&#x27;s efforts, and gave him tactical and financial assistance from France.

Heureaux, however, became a despot once he assumed the presidency. Luperón felt betrayed and went again into exile in Saint Thomas. Eventually he died of cancer, not before visiting Betances in France for a last time and being allowed to return to the Dominican Republic to die, as a gesture of good will from Heureaux. Due to Heureaux&#x27;s protracted presidency and blatant acts of corruption, Betances (who had called Heureaux his &quot;grandson&quot; in letters he had previously written to him) was forced to cut ties to the Dominican Republic for good (two plots of land that he owned both there and in Panama were used for agricultural experiments, but were later left unattended). Betances writes in his letters that he had spent the equivalent of US$20,000 (in 1880 dollars, roughly equivalent to US$400,000 in 2010) on expenditures on behalf of the Dominican diplomatic office. He did not expect the Dominican government to be able to reimburse him.

====Support for Cuba&#x27;s independence and José Maceo&#x27;s freedom====
Immediately after returning to Paris, Betances became a key contact for the Cuban insurgency in Paris. He made several fund raising efforts, including one that attempted to fund quinine shipments to the Cuban rebels, to ease their pain when infected by malaria in the island battlefields. These efforts outlasted the Pact of Zanjón, which ended the Ten Years&#x27; War in 1878. Betances also used his diplomatic contacts to guarantee humane treatment (and eventually freedom from imprisonment) to José Maceo, the brother of Antonio Maceo, the later military leader of the Cuban War of Independence, when both Antonio and José were arrested by the Spanish government in 1882. The Maceo brothers both escaped imprisonment, were recaptured in Gibraltar and turned over to the Spanish authorities, but José remained in jail long after Antonio regained his liberty and fled to New York City. Betances even used Lord Gladstone as a mediator, and attempted to convince him of having Jamaica (where his family had properties) join an Antillean Federation.

====Betances and Máximo Gómez====
When Puerto Rico experienced a period of severe political repression in 1887 by the Spanish governor of the time, Romualdo Palacio (which led to the arrest of many local political leaders, including Román Baldorioty de Castro), Máximo Gómez, who was living in Panama at the time (at the time, he supervised a laborers&#x27; brigade during the construction of the Panama Canal) offered his services to Betances, sold most of his personal belongings to finance a revolt in Puerto Rico, and volunteered to lead any Puerto Rican troops had such revolt occur. The revolt was deemed unnecessary later in the year, when the Spanish government recalled Palacio from office to investigate charges of abuse of power from his part, but Gómez and Betances established a friendship and logistical relationship that lasted until Betances&#x27; death in 1898.

====Betances and José Martí====
Years later, due to Betances&#x27; experience as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances&#x27; younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother&#x27;s revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of admiration for the Betances&#x27; family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to the leadership of the Cuban insurrection movement.

====Betances and Tomás Estrada Palma====
In April 1896 Betances was granted diplomatic credentials on behalf of the revolutionary government of Cuba. He became an active fund raiser and recruiter on behalf of the Cuban pro-independence movement. He also served as press officer and intelligence contact for the Cuban rebels in exile, and attempted to coordinate support for the pro-independence movement in the Philippines.

Betances openly hated Estrada when he first met him in the late 1870s, but grew more tolerant of him with time, and even defended Estrada&#x27;s actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada&#x27;s leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized with the idea of having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.

====The &quot;Intentona de Yauco&quot;====
In 1897, Antonio Mattei Lluveras, a wealthy coffee plantation owner from Yauco, visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramón Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martínez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco was to be directed by Betances, organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan Ríus Rivera. The coup, which was the second and last major revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico failed.

Betances was also a government representative for some of the governments of Haiti while in Paris. He was also technically a diplomat for the United States of America once.

====Morales Plan====
Through coordination with Betances and local pro-independence leaders in Puerto Rico, a Dominican military leader, Gen. José Morales, made plans to invade Puerto Rico in the late 1890s, to supply local revolutionaries with supplies and mercenaries, and take advantage of the weak Spanish military presence in Puerto Rico (there were only 4,500 Spanish soldiers in the island at the time, and 1,000 of them were later redirected to Cuba to fight the Cuban insurrection). However, the Cuban Revolutionary Party rejected the plan as being too expensive.

Betances, who had collected more money in France for the Party than the plan&#x27;s potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement&#x27;s diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party&#x27;s followers stationed in France wanted Betances to be stripped of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez&#x27;s mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.

Given the events happening in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work was more important than ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden to his heart and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.

===The Cánovas Affair===
There is some speculation that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 was at least supported or influenced by Betances, and possibly even planned by him (although there is no physical link that can be established that might link Betances to the event itself).

Betances&#x27; role in the Cánovas assassination is described by Puerto Rican (born in France) author Luis Bonafoux in his biography about Betances (written in 1901), and partially corroborated by later historians. These sources establish that Betances&#x27; circle of friends at the time included various Italian anarchists exiled in Paris, Domenico Tosti being one of them. Tosti and his friends would hold regular social events, during one of which Angiolillo was introduced to Betances.

Impressed by Betances&#x27; credentials, Angiolillo later approached Betances before the incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing one or more young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo&#x27;s travel to Spain, and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader on how to use a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances).

Betances sympathized with anarchists like Angiolillo, and hated monarchists like Cánovas, but this alone would not justify direct action from Betances into taking Cánovas&#x27; life. Betances did state at the time, however, that &quot;in Spain there is only one true retrograde and reactionary leader, and he is precisely the one who confronts Cuba with a policy of &#x27;(spending in a war up to) the very last man and the very last &quot;peseta&quot;,&#x27; the one who tries to suffocate all efforts that her patriots do to free her, and that man is Antonio Cánovas del Castillo.&quot;

Angiolillo, in true solidarity with the European anarchist current, sought to avenge the execution and/or torture of those implicated in a bombing against a Roman Catholic religious procession in Barcelona, which occurred in 1896, and for which Cánovas sought the maximum penalties allowed by law.

The truth is that Puerto Rican liberal interests benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas&#x27; death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed the establishment of a new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers than at any other time before or since.

Before his execution, Angiolillo claimed sole responsibility for the assassination. When asked about his involvement in the Cánovas affair, Betances said: &quot;No aplaudimos pero tampoco lloramos&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t applaud it, but we don&#x27;t cry over it, either&quot;), and added: &quot;Los revolucionarios verdaderos hacen lo que deben hacer&quot; (&quot;True revolutionaries do what they ought to do&quot;). Betances&#x27; ambiguous response blurs the true level of his involvement in the Cánovas assassination.

===Legion of Honor award===
Betances was awarded the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French government in July 1887, for his work as a diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d&#x27;honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.

===Efforts to counter the U.S. annexation of Puerto Rico===
In 1898 Betances attempted to use his diplomatic contacts to impede a Puerto Rico annexation by the United States, which was deemed imminent by the events following the sinking of the USS Maine. He knew that Puerto Ricans would welcome an American invasion, but was vehement about the possibility of the United States not conceding independence to Puerto Rico.

Betances was willing to accept some political concessions to the North American government in exchange for independence, and exchanged some privileged intelligence information (about the level of debt Spain had attained while fighting the Cuban insurrection) with the then-ambassador of the United States to France, Horace Porter, so as to show goodwill towards the United States.

Frustrated by what he perceived as the unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States while the island territory was annexed (the event occurred just days before his death), he uttered his final political stance: &quot;No quiero colonia, ni con España, ni con los Estados Unidos&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t want a colony status, neither with Spain nor with the United States&quot;). When reminded by de Hostos through a letter of what was happening in the island, he responded, highly frustrated, with a phrase that has become famous since: &quot;¿Y qué les pasa a los puertorriqueños que no se rebelan?&quot; (&quot;And what&#x27;s wrong with Puerto Ricans that they haven&#x27;t yet rebelled?&quot;)

Betances&#x27; last days were chaotic, not only because of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what happening in his own household. Jiménez&#x27; mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances&#x27; intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.

==Death==

Betances died at 10:00 a.m., local time, in Neuilly-sur-Seine on Friday, September 16, 1898. His remains were cremated soon after and entombed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery of Paris on Monday, September 19. He had requested that no formal ceremony be made for his funeral. His common law-wife Simplicia survived him for over 20 years. A look at his will implies that, besides a life insurance policy payout and two parcels of land in the Dominican Republic, Betances died almost in poverty.

As early as in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had publicly requested that Betances&#x27; wishes to have his ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act that would allow the transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France, to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act&#x27;s approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, to serve as an emissary and bring Betances&#x27; remains from France.

Betances&#x27; remains arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then estimated at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near the port of San Juan as early as 4:00 a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico since the death of Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised by the size of the crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.

A funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Party transferred the remains from the capital to the town of Cabo Rojo. It took the caravan two days to make the route. Once Betances&#x27; remains reached the city of Mayagüez, 8,000 mourners paid their respects. Betances&#x27; remains were laid to rest in Cabo Rojo&#x27;s municipal cemetery. A few decades later his remains were moved to a monument designed to honor Betances in the town&#x27;s plaza. There is a bust created by the Italian sculptor Diego Montano alongside the Grito de Lares revolutionary flag and the Puerto Rican flag in the plaza, which is also named after Betances.

A marble plaque commemorating Betances was unveiled at his Paris house by a delegation of Puerto Rican, Cuban and French historians on the 100th. anniversary of his death, on September 16, 1998.

==Legacy==
According to Puerto Ricans and French historians in three different fields (medicine, literature and politics), Betances left a legacy that has been considerably understated, and is only being assessed properly in recent times.

===Complete works===
Betances&#x27; two primary biographers, Paul Estrade and Félix Ojeda Reyes, have announced the publication of a compilation of Betances&#x27; complete works, comprising 14 volumes. José Carvajal is the collection&#x27;s editor. The first two volumes were formally published in Mayagüez on April 8, 2008. The first volume features most of Betances&#x27; written works about medicine; the second features intimate letters and document excerpts Betances wrote to family and friends over a span of 39 years. A third volume, which compiles some of Betances&#x27; literary works, was published in 2009.

The &quot;Voz del Centro&quot; Foundation in Puerto Rico released a series of youth-oriented books named &quot;Voces de la Cultura – Edición Juvenil&quot; that same year; its first title being &quot;Doctor Ramón Emeterio Betances: Luchador por la libertad y los pobres&quot; (&quot;Doctor R. E. Betances, Fighter for Liberty and the Poor&quot;).

===Landmarks===

====In the United States====
There is an elementary school in Hartford, Connecticut, named in honor of Betances and Hartford&#x27;s Puerto Rican community.

There is a plaza and mural in the south end of Boston, Massachusetts, named in honor of Betances.

====In Puerto Rico====
As mentioned above, the main thoroughfare that crosses Mayagüez from north to south is named after Betances. In Ponce there is a thoroughfare linking downtown Ponce and Puerto Rico highway 14, PR-14, which is named &quot;Avenida Betances&quot;.

===Political and sociological===

====In Puerto Rico====

The political and sociological consequences of Betances&#x27; actions are definite and unequivocal. He was the first openly nationalistic political leader in Puerto Rico, and one of the first pro-independence leaders in the island nation&#x27;s history (Among Puerto Ricans, Antonio Valero de Bernabé and Andrés Vizcarrondo—earlier pro-independence leaders for the Latin American revolutions—could not achieve the success Betances had years later within Puerto Rico). The &quot;Grito de Lares&quot;, using an often-quoted phrase that dates from 1868, &quot;was the birth of Puerto Rican nationality, with Betances as its obstetrician&quot;. Nationalistic expressions in Puerto Rico—be they public affirmations, newspaper articles, poems, town meetings or outright revolts—were almost nonexistent before the 1810s election of Ramón Power y Giralt to the Spanish Cortes, most of them were defined within the framework of loyalty to Spain as a metropolitan power (and thus subordinate to Spanish rule over Puerto Rico), and many of them were quickly suppressed by the Spanish government, which feared an escalation of nationalistic sentiment that, in other countries, led to the independence movements of Latin America.

Although the seeds of both proactive government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost a direct consequence of the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it can be traced back to Betances and his political work.

Betances is considered a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century. These ideas, considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation&#x27;s political and social history. His ideas on race relations alone had a major impact on economics and the social makeup of the island.

====In the Greater Antilles====
Political events in Puerto Rico and Cuba between the late 1860s and 1898 forced a liberalization of Spanish policy towards both territories, and Betances was directly involved as a protagonist in both circumstances. As a firm believer in &quot;Antillanismo&quot; (the common improvement and unity of the countries that formed the Greater Antilles) Betances was also a strong supporter of the sovereignty of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A Dominican historian and political leader, Manuel Rodríguez Objío, likened Betances&#x27; revolutionary work to that performed by Tadeusz Kościuszko for Poland, Lithuania and the United States of America. Paul Estrade, Betances&#x27; French biographer, likens him to Simón Bolívar, Antonio José de Sucre, Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins and José de San Martín.

José Martí considered Betances one of his &quot;teachers&quot;, or sources of political inspiration, and his diplomatic and intelligence work in France on behalf of the Cuban revolutionary junta greatly aided the cause, before it was directly influenced by the intervention of Gen. Valeriano Weyler as governor and commander of the Spanish forces in Cuba, and by the Maine incident later on.

Paul Estrade, Betances&#x27; French biographer, assesses his legacy as an Antillean this way: &quot;The Antilles have developed political, social and scientific ideas that have changed the world, and that Europe has used. Not everything has (a European) source. Betances is the maximum expression of this reality.&quot;

===Medical===

Betances wrote two books and various medical treatises while living in France. His doctoral thesis, &quot;Des Causes de l&#x27;ávortement&quot; (The Causes for Miscarriage) examines various possible causes for the spontaneous death of a fetus and/or its mother, was later used as a textbook on gynecology at some European universities. According to at least one medical practitioner who examined it in 1988, his attempt to explain the theory behind spontaneous contractions leading to childbirth were not very different from modern-day theories on the matter.

Betances&#x27; experiences handling the Mayagüez cholera epidemic led to another book, &quot;El Cólera: Historia, Medidas Profilácticas, Síntomas y Tratamiento&quot; (Cholera: History, Preventive Measures, Symptoms and Treatments), which he authored and published in Paris in 1884 and expanded in 1890. The book was later used as a public health textbook in dealing with similar cholera epidemics in Latin America.

Betances also wrote several medical articles while in France. One of the articles examines elephantiasis; another deals with surgical castration, called &quot;oscheotomy&quot; at the time. Both books were also based on personal experience: there is evidence about a surgery he performed in Mayagüez on a Spanish government official with an elephantiasis lesion of the scrotum the size of a grapefruit for which the costs were paid for by the local government; another patient he operated upon had a lesion that weighed He also wrote an article on urethral obstructions in male patients (see above).

===Literary===
Betances was also one of the first Puerto Rican &quot;writers-in-exile&quot;. In 1851, a small group of Puerto Rican university students in Europe formed the &quot;Sociedad Recolectora de Documentos Históricos de la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico&quot;, a society that attempted to research and catalog historical documents about Puerto Rico from firsthand government sources. Betances became the Society&#x27;s researcher in France. The result of the Society&#x27;s research was published in an 1854 book, for which Betances contributed. Inspired by Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, the Society&#x27;s organizer, who had written a novel inspired in Puerto Rican indigenous themes while studying in Madrid, Betances writes his novel: &quot;Les Deux Indiens: Épisode de la conquéte de Borinquen&quot; (The Two Indians: an episode of the conquest of Borinquen), and publishes it in Toulouse in 1853, with a second edition published in 1857 under the pseudonym &quot;Louis Raymond&quot;. This novel would be the first of many literary works by Betances (most of which were written in French), and is notable for its indirect praise of Puerto Rican nationhood which, he suggests, was already developed in pre-Columbian Puerto Rico. This type of &quot;indigenist literature&quot; would become commonplace in Latin America in later years. He also wrote poetry in both French and Spanish for literary magazines in Paris, chiefly inspired by Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo.

<text>Tim Hagans (born August 19, 1954) is an American jazz trumpeter, arranger, and composer. He has been nominated for three Grammy Awards: Best Instrumental Composition for &quot;Box of Cannoli&quot; on &quot;The Avatar Sessions&quot; (Fuzzy Music, 2010); Best Contemporary Jazz Album for &quot;Animation*Imagination&quot; (Blue Note, 1999); and Best Contemporary Jazz Album for &quot;Re-Animation&quot; (Blue Note, 2000).

==Career==

Hagans was born and grew up in Dayton, Ohio, United States. His early inspirations included Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, and Thad Jones, to whom he dedicated &quot;For the Music Suite&quot;, a 40-minute piece for jazz orchestra composed on a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1974, Hagans joined the Stan Kenton band, with whom he played until 1977, when he toured with Woody Herman. He then left for Europe, where he lived in Malmö, Sweden, a hotbed of the European jazz scene. While in Europe, he toured extensively and played with Dexter Gordon, Kenny Drew, Horace Parlan, and Thad Jones. His first recorded composition, &quot;I Hope This Time Isn&#x27;t the Last,&quot; appears on the album &quot;Thad Jones Live at Slukefter&quot; (Metronome, 1980).

In 1987, he moved to New York City. He has performed with Maria Schneider, Yellowjackets, Steps Ahead, Secret Society, and Gary Peacock. Hagans has worked extensively with producer and saxophonist Bob Belden on a variety of recordings and live performances, including their ongoing &quot;Animation/Imagination&quot; project. Festivals at which he has performed include the Mount Fuji Festival in Japan, the Montreal Jazz Festival, the Berlin Jazz Tage, and the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland.

Hagans has taught master classes at universities throughout the world.

He taught at the University of Cincinnati from 1982 to 1984 and at Berklee College of Music from 1984 to 1987. From 1996 to 2010, he was Artistic Director and Composer-in-Residence for the located in Luleå, Sweden. The Norrbotten Big Band is a 17-piece jazz orchestra for whom Hagans wrote and arranged original compositions, with guest artists including Randy Brecker, Joe Lovano, Dave Liebman, Peter Erskine, and Rufus Reid, an enterprise culminating in the Grammy Award nominated album, &quot;The Avatar Sessions: The Music of Tim Hagans&quot;, for which the Norbotten Big Band traveled to New York. His compositions are featured on numerous recordings with the Norrbotten Big Band, including &quot;Future North&quot; (Double-Time, 1998), &quot;Future Miles&quot; (ACT, 2002), and &quot;Worth the Wait&quot; (Fuzzy Music, 2007).

Hagans has been commissioned by several other European jazz orchestras, including the NDR Big Band in Hamburg, UMO in Helsinki, and he was Composer-in-Residence at the Jazz Baltica Festival in 2000. In 2008, he was awarded the ASCAP/IAJE Established Composer Award, and in 2009 he was commissioned by the Barents Composers Orchestra to write a piece for strings, woodwinds, and percussion: &quot;Daytonality&quot;, a piece based on improvisational melodic language.

Hagans is the subject of the feature documentary &quot;Boogaloo Road,&quot; directed by Runar Enberg and Marianne Soderberg. He is a featured soloist on Howard Shore&#x27;s soundtrack for the feature film &quot;The Score&quot; starring Marlon Brando, Edward Norton, and Robert De Niro.

Following his interest in exploring theatrical venues for innovative jazz, he is Composer-in-Residence with the Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble, a dance company located in Houston, Texas, and in New York City. In January 2012, his composition &quot;Outside My Window&quot; was performed with the MBDE at Dance Theatre of Harlem. He also performs with author-actor Peter Josyph in duets consisting of haiku texts and freely improvised trumpet, including Josyph&#x27;s &quot;the way of the trumpet&quot;, a haiku novel written for and dedicated to Hagans.

In June 2012, Hagans was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki.

<text>The Scioto Company was a company led by American colonel William Duer, a land speculator, that swindled prospective settlers to the United States by selling worthless deeds of land. 

Duer worked with a British colleague and several French men to register and organize the company in Paris, France. Ostensibly working with the Ohio Company to purchase land in the Northwest Territory, agents of this institution sold worthless deeds to French people intending to emigrate to the United States. Many were refugees from the excesses of the French Revolution, and the émigrés were made up of minor aristocrats, merchants, artisans and craftsmen. The Scioto Company did not own the land it was selling.

==History==
The Scioto Land Company was founded by American speculator Colonel William Duer and others in 1787 after the Northwest Territory was organized. It was officially established in 1789 as the &quot;Compagnie du Scioto&quot; in Paris by American Joel Barlow; William Playfair, a Scot who was the agent of Duer and his associates abroad; plus six Frenchmen.

This company had arranged in 1787 with the Ohio Company, for the use of about (another source says about ), north of the Ohio River and east of the Scioto River, on which the Ohio Company had secured an option. The dishonesty of those who conducted the sales in France, the shady methods of Barlow, and the failure of Duer and his associates to meet their contract with the Ohio Company, caused the collapse of the Scioto Company early in 1790. Two subsequent attempts to revive it failed.

Meanwhile, about had been purportedly &quot;sold&quot; to prospective settlers, companies and individuals in France. On February 19, 1791, 218 of these purchasers left Havre de Grace, in France, and arrived on May 3 in Alexandria, District of Columbia (now Alexandria, Virginia).

They were among a group known as the French 500, many of whom were fleeing the disruption of the French Revolution. On their arrival, they were told that the Scioto Company owned no land. When they reached Marietta, Ohio, along the Ohio River, about fifty of them landed. In October 1791, the rest of the company proceeded to Gallipolis, which was laid out about that time. It is now within Gallia County, Ohio. The developer had built rude huts for the group, who were mostly urban residents with few skills to survive on the undeveloped frontier. The agent assured them that this site was within the boundary of their purchase. This land, however, fell within the limits of the tract bought outright by the Ohio Company. It had sold it to the Scioto Company, but reclaimed it after Scioto Company failed to complete its payments.

In 1794, William Bradford, the U.S. Attorney General, decided that all rights in the on which the Ohio Company had secured an option for the Scioto Company were legally vested in the Ohio Company. In 1795, the Ohio Company sold to the French settlers for $1.25 an acre ($309/km2) the land they occupied and adjacent improved lots. They effectively had to pay twice for their land.

Learning of their plight, in 1795 the United States government granted the French some in the southern part of what is now Scioto County, Ohio, with lengthy frontage on the Ohio River. This is known as the First French Grant. Some of the company moved to that area, but most remained in Gallipolis, committed to the land they had started to develop. Four thousand acres of the French Grant were reserved for John Gabriel Gervais, and 20,000 acres were to be divided among the remaining inhabitants of Gallipolis.

Eight inhabitants of Gallipolis somehow missed out on the 1795 distribution. In 1798 Congress made an additional adjacent grant, the Second Grant, of for these eight. With their lives having been started in Gallipolis, most of the French residents never occupied either of the grants; they either sold their allotted land or sent tenant farmers to occupy their plots.

<text>A test target (for spacecraft) is a common feature on interplanetary landing craft such as the Viking Lander and Mars Exploration Rovers.

The target is usually a visible marker or plate on the exterior of the vehicle within sight of the lander&#x27;s imaging system (usually a CCD camera). The target possesses samples of primary colors and a grey scale. The camera uses this much like a photographer would use a chip chart on Earth; the color samples allow the camera to compensate for white balance and contrast. The target provides a visual reference as well, so that the initial orientation of the camera can be fixed.

On the Mars Exploration Rover, the target was designed with a pillar elevated above the main surface, so that it could be used as a sundial.</text><links>

<text>The Delisle scale is a temperature scale invented in 1732 by the French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle (1688–1768). The Delisle scale is notable as one of the few temperature scales that are inverted from the amount of thermal energy they measure; unlike most other temperature scales, higher measurements in degrees Delisle are colder, while lower measurements are warmer.

== History ==

In 1732, Delisle built a thermometer that used mercury as a working fluid. Delisle chose his scale using the temperature of boiling water as the fixed zero point and measured the contraction of the mercury (with lower temperatures) in hundred-thousandths. Delisle thermometers usually had 2400 or 2700 gradations, appropriate for the winter in St. Petersburg, as he had been invited by Peter the Great to the city to found an observatory in 1725. In 1738, Josias Weitbrecht recalibrated the Delisle thermometer with two fixed points, keeping 0 degrees as the boiling point and adding 150 degrees as the freezing point of water. He then sent this calibrated thermometer to various scholars, including Anders Celsius. The Celsius scale, like the Delisle scale, originally ran from zero for boiling water down to 100 for freezing water. This was reversed to its modern order after his death, in part at the instigation of Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus and the manufacturer of Linnaeus thermometers, Daniel Ekström.

The Delisle thermometer remained in use for almost 100 years in Russia. One of its users was Mikhail Lomonosov, who reversed it in his own work, measuring the freezing point of water as 0 °D and the boiling point as 150 °D.

<text>University of the Pacific (Pacific or UOP) is a private university originally founded as a Methodist-affiliated university with its main campus in Stockton, California, United States, and graduate campuses in San Francisco and Sacramento. It was the first university in the state of California, the first independent coeducational campus in California, and the first conservatory of music and first medical school on the West Coast.

Pacific was chartered on July 10, 1851, in Santa Clara, California, under the name California Wesleyan College. The school moved to San Jose in 1871 and then to Stockton in 1923. Pacific is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission. In addition to its liberal arts college and graduate school, Pacific has schools of business, dentistry, education, engineering, international studies, law, music, pharmacy, and health sciences.

It is home to the papers of environmental pioneer John Muir in Pacific&#x27;s Holt-Atherton Special Collections and Archives. The university also has a John Muir Center that hosts a Muir Symposium to encourage the use of John Muir&#x27;s Papers. At Pacific&#x27;s William Knox Holt Memorial Library, there is a museum style presentational space for Muir&#x27;s Papers. The Muir Experience has on display physical and digital exhibits to inspire user interaction with Muir&#x27;s work.

==History==
Pacific was founded on July 10, 1851, in Santa Clara. It was originally named California Wesleyan College, but one month later, it petitioned to have its name changed to the University of the Pacific. In 1858, the college opened the first medical school on the West Coast, the Medical Department of the University of the Pacific. The medical school was later affiliated with University College under the name Cooper Medical College, and in 1908 it was taken over by Stanford University and became the Stanford University School of Medicine.

In 1871, the campus was moved to San Jose, to an area that came to be known as the College Park neighborhood, and opened its doors to women, becoming the first independent co-educational campus in California. In 1878, the Conservatory of Music was established at Pacific, making it the first of its kind west of the Mississippi River. In 1896, Napa College merged with the college. In 1911, the name was changed to College of the Pacific (COP).

In 1923, the campus relocated from the Bay Area to the city of Stockton becoming the first private four-year university in the Central Valley. In 1925, the San Jose campus was sold to Santa Clara College which moved its Santa Clara Prep to the campus and renamed it Bellarmine College Preparatory.

The university expanded into graduate and professional education in the 1950s, establishing the School of Pharmacy in 1955 and the Graduate School in 1956. The School of Engineering was established in 1957. In 1961, the university resumed using the name University of the Pacific.

In 1962, Pacific merged with the San Francisco College of Physicians and Surgeons (established in 1896 in San Francisco), and then in 1966, with the McGeorge School of Law (established in 1924 in Sacramento).

In the late 1960s, when federal law surrounding funding of church-associated universities came into question, Pacific stopped receiving funding from the United Methodist Church, but maintains its affiliation with the church while operating as a non-denominational school.
Also in the 1960s, three new colleges were established that were modeled after British universities Oxford and Cambridge, integrating faculty and students into distinct living and learning communities: Raymond College (1962) was introduced as an accelerated, interdisciplinary liberal arts program in which students could shape their courses of study; Elbert Covell College (1963) was a unique inter-American college, with half its students from the U.S. and half from Latin America and classes taught in Spanish; and Callison College (1967) focused on non-western studies, giving students the opportunity to spend a year of their studies in Asia. These independent colleges merged with the rest of the university in 1982. 
In 2013, the university received an estate gift of $125 million from Robert and Jeanette Powell. It is the largest gift in the university&#x27;s history. This gift increased Pacific&#x27;s endowment to $334 million. That same year, Pacific awarded its highest honor, the Order of Pacific, to the Powells.

In fall 2018, the university announced a planned tuition increase and budget cuts. This was the third consecutive year of such plans. In response to these financial plans and the perceived secrecy with which they had been developed, faculty voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the university&#x27;s president Pamela Eibeck and students protested.

In May 2019, the university&#x27;s board of regents approved a new health school, which launched in fall 2020 with four new graduate health care programs. The board also approved merging the Gladys L. Benerd School of Education with University College to form Benerd College, a new school focused on innovative educational programs with flexible pricing and delivery methods, including hybrid and online programs for working adults.

==Campuses==

===Stockton===
The Stockton Campus, featuring a tower, rose gardens, architectural columns, brick-faced buildings, and numerous trees, has been used in Hollywood films, due to its aesthetic likeness to East Coast Ivy League universities: &quot;High Time&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot;, &quot;Dead Man on Campus&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;Flubber&quot;, and &quot;Dreamscape&quot;, among others. Part of Disney&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; was also shot at Pacific.
The Stockton Campus is home to three main residential halls: Grace Covell Hall, Southwest Hall, which closed after the 22/23 school year and is set to reopen after major renovations, and the Quad Buildings. The Quads are composed of several separate smaller residence halls in proximity to each other. Grace Covell is the largest residence hall on campus holding more than 350 students. Junior and seniors can find housing in the University Townhouses on the northwest side of campus, McCaffrey Center Apartments located in the center of campus or in the three apartment buildings: Monagan Hall, Chan Family Hall, and Calaveras Hall, which is named after the river that flows through the campus, the Calaveras River. There are also fraternity and sorority houses located on campus.

The university opened the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold-certified John T. Chambers Technology Center, home of the university&#x27;s School of Engineering and Computer Science, in 2010. Calaveras Hall, a new apartment-style residence hall, opened in 2018. In 2019, the university renovated the William Knox Holt Memorial Library.

The campus is home to Morris Chapel, a non-denominational church.

===Sacramento===
Pacific&#x27;s 13-acre Sacramento Campus houses graduate and professional programs and a degree completion program in the Oak Park neighborhood, south of downtown. It consists of 24 buildings, including academic facilities, four residential facilities, and a fitness center/pool.

The campus includes the McGeorge School of Law, which is the only law school approved by the American Bar Association in Sacramento County. In 2015, Pacific began a transformation of its Sacramento Campus by adding graduate and professional programs. The campus now houses the School of Health Sciences, alongside McGeorge, with programs focused on law, health sciences, organizational leadership, and public policy.

===San Francisco===

Pacific&#x27;s San Francisco Campus is located in San Francisco&#x27;s South of Market neighborhood, containing classrooms, administrative offices, a simulation laboratory and clinics offering dental care to the public through the Dugoni School of Dentistry. The San Francisco Campus also includes graduate programs in analytics, audiology, food studies, and music therapy.

===Campus sustainability===
The university strives to promote environmental responsibility. Students are given opportunities to take part in sustainability service projects through the M.O.V.E. (Mountains, Ocean, Valley Experience) program. The on-campus dining services participates in the Farm to Fork Program, buying food locally where feasible. In 2009, students from the Residence for Earth and Environmental Living and Learning (a campus residential learning community), the Students for Environmental Action, and the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences designed and implemented the &quot;Tap That&quot; campaign, whose goal was to inform students, faculty and staff about the effects of disposable water bottles on the environment.

The university has been listed in the Sierra Club&#x27;s list of &quot;Cool Schools&quot;—universities that value sustainability. The university opened several LEED-certified buildings, including the Don and Karen DeRosa University Center, the John T. Chambers Technology Center, and the Vereschagin Alumni House and has an interactive garden program on its Stockton and Sacramento campuses. In 2019, Pacific was ranked eighth for the sustainability of campus buildings by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. In 2021 and 2022, Pacific was ranked among the top 10 universities in the world for sustainable food and dining practices on college campuses.

Pacific installed solar panels over eight parking lots on the Stockton campus, which provide 30% of the campus&#x27;s energy needs. The project, which was completed in April 2022, also involved the installation of 16 electric car ports in a partnership with Tesla.

Pacific had previously competed in the NCAA Division II California Collegiate Athletic Association conference but left in 1950. In 1952, Pacific became a charter member of the California Basketball Association, which soon became the West Coast Athletic Conference (WCAC) and is now the West Coast Conference (WCC). They remained in the WCAC until joining the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, now known as the Big West Conference, in 1969 for football and 1971 for other sports. Pacific dropped football after the 1995 season and returned to the WCC in 2013.
Facilities on the Stockton Campus include the 2,500-seat Klein Family Field for baseball, the 350-seat Bill Simoni Field for softball, the 6,150-seat Alex G.

University of the Pacific competes in NCAA Division I athletics as the Pacific Tigers in the West Coast Conference. After over 40 years of being in a conference (the PCAA/Big West) in which they were the only private school ever to have been a member, they returned to a league that is now composed exclusively of private, faith-based schools.

<text>The French Grant (also known as the French-Grant Estates) was a land tract in the Northwest Territory, present day Scioto County, Ohio, that was paid out by the U.S. Congress on March 31, 1795. This was after a group of French colonists were defrauded by the Scioto Company of purchased land grants which rightly were controlled by the Ohio Company of Associates. Not all of the settlers took the grant, some preferring to stay on the East Coast others preferring stay in Gallipolis, Ohio in Gallia County. (Gallia and Gallipolis were named for Gaul, the ancient Latin name of France.)

The First Grant extended from a point on the Ohio River above and opposite the mouth of Little Sandy River (Kentucky) in Kentucky, and extending eight miles (13 km) in a direct line down the river, and from the two extremities of that line, reaching back at right angles sufficiently far to include the quantity of land required, which somewhat exceeded . Of these , were awarded to John Gabriel Gervais for having pursued the grant; the remaining were split into 92 lots of each.

Another additional were granted on June 25, 1798 called the Second Grant. These lots adjoined the first Grant towards its lower end. This grant was for eight Gallipolis residents who did not receive a portion of the First Grant.

<text>Terry Alan Kath (January 31, 1946 – January 23, 1978) was an American guitarist and singer who is best known as a founding member of the rock band Chicago. He played lead guitar and sang lead vocals on many of the band&#x27;s early hit singles alongside Robert Lamm and Peter Cetera. He has been praised by his bandmates and other musicians for his guitar skills and his Ray Charles–influenced vocal style. Jimi Hendrix cited Terry Kath as one of his favorite guitarists, and considered Kath to be &quot;the best guitarist in the universe&quot;.

Growing up in a musical family, Kath took up a variety of instruments in his teens, including the drums and banjo. He played bass in a number of bands in the mid-1960s, before settling on the guitar when forming the group that became Chicago. His guitar playing was an important component of the group&#x27;s sound from the start of their career. He used a number of different guitars, but eventually became identified with a Fender Telecaster fitted with a single neck-position humbucker pickup combined with a bridge position angled single-coil pickup and decorated with numerous stickers.

Kath struggled with health problems and drug abuse towards the end of the 1970s. He died in January 1978 from an unintentional self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The bereavement tempted Chicago to disband, but they ultimately decided to resume as is signified by their memorial song &quot;Alive Again&quot;. To commemorate his musicianship, they issued the 1997 album &quot;The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath&quot;. In 2016, Kath&#x27;s daughter Michelle Sinclair released the documentary &quot;The Terry Kath Experience&quot;, which chronicles his life and Chicago&#x27;s early years.

== Early life ==
Kath was born to Raymond Elmer &quot;Ray&quot; Kath (1912–2003) and Evelyn Meline (nee Haugen) Kath (1916–1982) on January 31, 1946, in Chicago. He had an older brother, Rod Kath, was raised in the Norwood Park neighborhood of Chicago, and attended Taft High School.

His brother played the drums and his mother played the banjo, and Kath attempted to learn these instruments too. He acquired a guitar and amplifier when he was in the ninth grade, and his early influences included The Ventures, Johnny Smith, Dick Dale, and Howard Roberts. He was later influenced by George Benson, Kenny Burrell, Mike Bloomfield, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix.

Unlike several other Chicago members who received formal music training, Kath was mostly self-taught and enjoyed jamming. In a 1971 interview for &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, he said he had tried professional lessons but abandoned them, adding &quot;All I wanted to do was play those rock and roll chords.&quot; His father wanted him to have a steady career, but he decided he would prefer a career in music.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Terry Kath joined his first semi-professional band, The Mystics, in 1963, moving to Jimmy Rice and the Gentlemen in 1965. He then played bass in a road band called Jimmy Ford and the Executives. Considered to be the bandleader, Kath guided the band&#x27;s musical direction. Ford was the trumpeter, Walter Parazaider played saxophone and other wind instruments, and Danny Seraphine later became the drummer. Kath became close friends with Seraphine and Parazaider. The three musicians regularly socialized outside of the band. They were fired from the group, which wanted to merge with another band, Little Artie and the Pharaohs, while leader and guitarist Mike Sistack explained that &quot;it&#x27;s just business.&quot;

In 1966, Kath joined a cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago on a regular basis. Parazaider&#x27;s friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath&#x27;s compatriot James William Guercio (who later became Chicago&#x27;s producer) was lead guitarist in one of two road bands performing on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot; with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider&#x27;s parents&#x27; basement and changed its name to The Big Thing. With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. The real Chicago Transit Authority objected to the band&#x27;s use of the name so in mid-1969 the name was shortened to Chicago.

=== Chicago ===

Kath was regarded as Chicago&#x27;s bandleader and best soloist; his vocal, jazz and hard rock influences are regarded as integral to the band&#x27;s early sound. He has been praised for his guitar skills and described by rock author Corbin Reiff as &quot;one of the most criminally underrated guitarists to have ever set finger to fretboard&quot;. According to Loughnane, Kath could sing a lead vocal and play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously.

The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, released in 1969, includes Kath&#x27;s composition &quot;Introduction&quot;, described as &quot;Terry&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; by later Chicago guitarist Dawayne Bailey. The song displays many varied musical styles, including jazz, blues, salsa, rock and roll, acid rock, and pop. The same debut album includes an instrumental guitar piece titled &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot;, which consisted largely of feedback and heavy use of the Stratocaster&#x27;s tremolo arm. The album liner notes indicate that the nearly seven-minute piece was recorded live in the studio in one take, using only a Fender Dual Showman amplifier pre-amped with a Bogen Challenger P.A. amp. The guitar&#x27;s neck was held together with a radiator hose clamp. The song &quot;Beginnings&quot; includes acoustic rhythm guitar by Kath.

For the group&#x27;s second album, Kath contributed an extended guitar solo on &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, which became a live favorite. The same album saw Kath collaborate with orchestral arranger Peter Matz on the four-part suite &quot;Memories of Love&quot;, singing the lead vocal.

Kath wrote at least one song and contributed at least one lead vocal to every Chicago album released during his lifetime. While 1976&#x27;s &quot;Chicago X&quot; is best known for Cetera&#x27;s number one hit, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, Kath&#x27;s &quot;Once or Twice&quot; showed he was still writing and recording rock material. He continued this style on the following year&#x27;s &quot;Chicago XI&quot;, contributing the funky &quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot; and the aggressive &quot;Takin&#x27; It on Uptown&quot;, which counterbalanced some of the material other members were producing.

After his death, to memorialize Kath and to commemorate the resumption of Chicago, the band composed and published the song &quot;Alive Again&quot; on its first album without him, &quot;Hot Streets&quot;. Also in Kath&#x27;s honor, they later published the song &quot;Feel the Spirit&quot;.

== Equipment ==
Kath used several guitars in his early career, but many of these early ones were stolen while on the road. His first main instrument that he used when Chicago were still The Big Thing was a Register guitar that cost $80. When the band started becoming successful, he traded up to a Fender Stratocaster. He also used a Gibson SG Standard, as pictured on &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;″s inner sleeve, and a Gibson SG Custom, and was one of the few well-known guitarists to make regular use of the 1969 Les Paul &quot;Professional&quot; model, which sported a pair of unconventional low-impedance pickups with a special impedance-matching transformer for use with a standard high impedance-input amplifier. Kath tended to favor light strings, though for the top E string, he used one from a tenor guitar. In an interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, he said that he used the tenor guitar string for the top E and moved all the regular strings down (top E was used as B, B used as a G, and so forth). For acoustic parts, he played an Ovation acoustic guitar.

In the latter part of his career, he favored a Fender Telecaster, which he heavily modified. The standard blonde Telecaster had its black pickguard and its neck-position pickup removed, and the hole enlarged and fitted with a Gibson humbucker. The guitar control plate was also reversed. He was an early investor in the Pignose company (a manufacturer of guitar amplifiers) and served in the management of the company and decorated his Telecaster with 25 Pignose stickers, a Maico motorcycles decal and a Chicago Blackhawks logo. Most of Kath&#x27;s guitars had gone missing for many years, including the famous &quot;Pignose&quot; Telecaster. Several were located by Kath&#x27;s daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair, at the home of her step-grandmother, during her research for the documentary film &quot;Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience&quot;. Among the re-discovered equipment was his &quot;Pignose&quot; Telecaster, an Ovation acoustic, a Fender Stratocaster, and a Gibson SG Custom with the pickups removed.

Kath experimented with a wide variety of amplification and distortion devices and used a wah-wah pedal frequently. Fascinated by gadgets, Kath was interested in trying to play guitar without using a pick. Lamm recalled him attempting to make an auto-picking device using a modified electrical cocktail mixer.

== Vocals ==
Kath sang lead vocals on several of Chicago&#x27;s early songs, including &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; (&quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;), &quot;Colour My World&quot;, &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (both part of &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot;), &quot;Movin&#x27; In&quot;, and &quot;In The Country&quot; (&quot;Chicago II&quot;), &quot;Free&quot; (&quot;Chicago III&quot;), &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot; (&quot;Chicago V&quot;), &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; (&quot;Chicago VII&quot;), and &quot;Brand New Love Affair&quot; (&quot;Chicago VIII&quot;). His vocal delivery was later described by Lamm as &quot;The White Ray Charles&quot;. Pankow, who wrote &quot;Make Me Smile&quot;, tried rehearsing the song with various members singing lead, but ultimately settled on Kath, saying &quot;bingo – &#x27;that&#x27; was the voice.&quot; Kath was one of the three primary lead singers of Chicago, with a vocal range between those of the other two, Peter Cetera&#x27;s higher tenor and Robert Lamm&#x27;s fuller, lower baritone. He often collaborated with Cetera on lead vocals as they did in &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II),&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Blue,&quot; &quot;In The Country,&quot; and &quot;Brand New Love Affair&quot;.

Kath also played lead guitar and sang lead vocals on the closing song &quot;Tell Me&quot; in the 1973 drama movie &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;. The song was used in the final episode of the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Kath had a self-admitted history of drug abuse, including alcohol. Seraphine knew that Kath had a high tolerance for drugs and later recalled Kath telling him, &quot;I&#x27;m going to get things under control ... if I don&#x27;t, this stuff is going to kill me.&quot; Chicago bandmates including Seraphine have noted that he was then also becoming increasingly unhappy. The night before he died, Kath visited bandmate Laudir de Oliveira. De Oliveira offered him tea and the two spent all night talking. Guercio has said that Kath was finishing writing a solo album before he died, and Pankow has adamantly denied that Kath was suicidal.

Kath enjoyed target shooting and by 1978 was regularly carrying guns. On Monday, January 23, after a party at the home of roadie and band technician Don Johnson, in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, Kath began to play with his guns. He spun his unloaded .38 revolver on his finger, put it to his temple, and pulled the trigger. Johnson warned Kath several times to be careful. Kath picked up a semi-automatic 9 mm pistol and, leaning back in a chair, said to Johnson, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it ... Look, the clip is not even in it&quot;. His last words were, &quot;What do you think I&#x27;m gonna do? Blow my brains out?&quot; To calm Johnson&#x27;s concerns, Kath showed him the empty magazine. Kath then replaced the magazine in the gun, put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. Apparently unbeknownst to Kath, the gun had a round in the chamber. He died instantly from the gunshot, eight days before his 32nd birthday.

Kath left behind his wife, Camelia Ortiz, and a 20-month-old daughter, Michelle Kath (now Michelle Kath Sinclair since her marriage to actor Adam Sinclair).

Kath is interred near his mother, Evelyn Kath, and father, Raymond Kath, in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, in the Gardens of Remembrance.

The group&#x27;s members were devastated over losing Kath and strongly considered disbanding, but were persuaded by Doc Severinsen, musical director of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; band, to continue. Kath&#x27;s position as guitarist in Chicago was filled by Donnie Dacus. At Chicago concerts, members Lee Loughnane (trumpet) and Robert Lamm (keyboards) have performed lead vocals originally sung by Kath.

== Legacy ==
Because Chicago considered themselves a team, some band members have subsequently claimed Kath&#x27;s contributions to be generally overlooked. Chicago band member Walter Parazaider later said, &quot;If [Kath] was totally up front, he would have gotten a &quot;lot&quot; more recognition.&quot; According to Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix commented to him after a set at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles that &quot;your guitar player is better than me.&quot;

In September 1997, Chicago released &quot;Chicago Presents The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath&quot;, a CD remembrance of their late guitarist, on their own short-lived Chicago Records label.

Band members have since wondered if Kath would have stayed with Chicago had he lived or started a solo career. In 2010, Parazaider said:
&quot;I&#x27;m not sure about that. [Terry] was a free spirit ... He was his own person when it came to different things. I would like to think he (would still be with Chicago) but he was very independent and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s. I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s 50/50. It could have gone either way.&quot;

In 2012, Kath&#x27;s daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair announced that enough funds had been donated to complete production on a documentary of his life, titled &quot;Searching for Terry: Discovering a Guitar Legend&quot;. In 2014, she confirmed she had interviewed the entire band except for Cetera and the project was planned for release in 2016. The film made its world premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, renamed as &quot;The Terry Kath Experience&quot;, and Peter Cetera was listed among the cast members. It made its United States premiere at the DOC NYC film festival in November 2016 under the same name, and was soon after acquired by FilmRise, which planned a 2017 release. The film made its television premiere on AXS TV, under the name &quot;Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience&quot;, on November 7, 2017, and it was released as VOD and DVD on December 12. The film includes interviews with guitarists Jeff Lynne, Steve Lukather, Mike Campbell, Dean DeLeo and Joe Walsh, who all praised Kath&#x27;s work. Walsh said, &quot;He was a great guy; he was a brilliant musician. He was a songwriter and a great singer. He was such a monster on guitar. ... He was just a total experimenter&quot;.

On April 8, 2016, Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Michelle Kath Sinclair accepted the award on her father&#x27;s behalf.

<text>Tomorrow Never Dies (also known as 007: Tomorrow Never Dies) is a 1999 third-person shooter stealth video game based on the 1997 James Bond film of the same name. It was developed by Black Ops Entertainment and co-published by Electronic Arts and MGM Interactive for the PlayStation.

Development began in 1997, before the film&#x27;s release. The game&#x27;s storyline was originally meant to pick up after the events of the film, but this was scrapped following feedback from focus groups. The game&#x27;s release was delayed several times, and additional levels and a multiplayer mode were removed during development.

The game was eventually released in November 1999, the same month that the next film in the Bond series, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, was released in cinemas. It is the first 007 game to be published by Electronic Arts since acquiring the James Bond licence. It was released following the success of another James Bond game, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1997). Critics were disappointed with &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, believing that it fell short of the previous game, although the soundtrack was praised.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is a third-person shooter with elements of stealth gameplay. MI6 agent James Bond is the player character for most of the game, and Chinese agent Wai Lin is also playable in one level. The player can walk, run, sneak, sidestep, and roll. A variety of weapons can be used throughout the game, including a sniper. The game switches to a first-person perspective when aiming weapons.

Clips from the film are shown after each level to advance the story. The game is played across ten levels, two of which include a skiing portion. Another level is played primarily as a driving game, with the player using an armed car to destroy enemy vehicles.

==Plot==
The game&#x27;s plot closely follows that of the film. Bond begins to cross the China–Russia border into a Russian radar base, which is intercepting messages delicate in subject. Using a laser designator, Bond targets the dish and a British jet flies over, dropping an air-to-surface missile. A helicopter arrives, and Bond kills the occupants and recovers a key. He uses the key to unlock a large gate and makes his escape on skis. Bond reaches the end of the run - a sheer cliff drop. Bond continues, and opens his Union Jack parachute.

Bond later lands in an arms bazaar. After taking photographs of military hardware, a British naval ship launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk to eliminate all potential threats and hardware. Bond realizes there are nuclear weapons at the Bazaar on a L-39 Albatros jet. After an intense firefight between Bond and Russian terrorists, he hijacks the jet and returns to MI6.

Bond is sent to investigate a man called Elliot Carver during a party in Hamburg, Germany after a British warship sank in the South China Sea, with all hands going down. Carver Media published the full story before MI6 received a full report, raising MI6&#x27;s suspicions. During the party Bond meets his former lover, Paris, now Carver&#x27;s wife, who slaps him. Carver arrives, and offers a &quot;tour of the facilities&quot;. Bond follows, but is knocked out by a henchman. He wakes up in a room with a large 2-way mirror. He uses his laser-cufflinks to escape, then he destroys the central computer, allowing him to make his escape. He then makes his way to the press and engages in a firefight between Carver&#x27;s guards.

He recovers Henry Gupta&#x27;s GPS scrambler, which was used to lure the British navy into Chinese waters to try and spark an international incident. As the existing Chinese government is not receptive to giving Carver Media Group Network exclusive broadcast rights in China, Carver plans to start a war to eliminate the present government and replace it with politicians more supportive of his plans. Bond then escapes to the Hotel Atlantic, where Paris is being held prisoner. He arrives, and heads to the bar where he asks to see Paris; resulting in a shootout between Bond and the guards, who were working for Carver. Bond uses the elevator to get to Paris&#x27; apartment, where he meets Kaufman. Kaufman tries to kill Bond by using spinning razor discs and an AK-47. Bond kills Kaufman and helps Paris escape. They go to the underground garage, where Bond drives away in his BMW 7 Series.

MI6 has found the headquarters of Henry Gupta near the foothills of the Swiss Alps. The convoy of terrorist cars and trucks is heading to Gupta&#x27;s Alpine hideout for an important meeting. Bond is sent to stop the convoy. Along the way, Bond meets Q, who gives him the BMW to stop the convoy. Bond successfully destroys the convoy with the BMW and drives away. Bond is then sent to a ski ridge in Hokkaido, Japan, to track down and kill chemical expert Satoshi Isagura, who is thought to be working for Elliot Carver after a nerve gas attack in Yokohama. Carver Media was also the first to report the story. Bond kills Isagura and is sent to Saigon.

Bond steals a data disk from Carver Media Tower in Saigon but is captured. Bond manages to escape with the data disk. The next night, Carver bribes the Saigon Military Police to kill Bond on sight, so MI6 pulls Bond out as the mission would be compromised were Bond to be seen or killed. Bond gives Wai Lin the data disk, and Wai Lin engages the Saigon Military Police in a gun battle with the police setting roadblocks and using fast-firing chain guns. She makes it back to her lab to find the location of Carter&#x27;s stealth boat, hidden in Hạ Long Bay. On the stealth boat, Bond uses the boat&#x27;s commlink to give MI6 its position. Wai Lin is kidnapped but is later freed by Bond after he kills Carver&#x27;s right-hand man, Stamper. Wai Lin stops the engine while Bond shoots and kills Carver and stops the stolen nuclear missile from destroying Beijing. Bond and Wai Lin escape the stealth boat before it self-destructs.

==Development==
Before the 1997 release of the film, MGM Interactive approached Black Ops Entertainment about developing a video game adaptation. Early development was already underway by the time that another James Bond game, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, had been released. Black Ops CEO John Botti said that &quot;GoldenEye&quot; &quot;raised the bar for video gaming in general, but our different platform and movie inspiration destined us to make a different game – one specifically for the PlayStation – with a similar but different Bond experience&quot;. The skiing and driving portions, along with the third-person perspective, were added to distinguish the game from &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, a first-person shooter which lacked such gameplay elements.

As work began on the game, Botti watched all of the James Bond films released up to that point. For the sake of gameplay, the game includes some differences from the film such as skiing, a feature that Black Ops was intent on adding. Scuba diving had also been planned. Programmer Will Botti began working on the game in November 1997, and was given a short period of 30 days to create a game engine for the skiing levels. Will Botti would become the project director in April 1998.

The game had a development period of approximately two years. It was originally intended as a continuation of the film with a story that would have picked up where the film left off. David Bishop, president of MGM Home Entertainment, said in June 1998, &quot;We didn&#x27;t see any benefit to following the script verbatim. We just felt we had more freedom in what we could bring the gaming world if we went outside the set script.&quot; However, focus groups were more interested in seeing familiar scenes from the film. The game&#x27;s release was delayed several times, and was scheduled at one point for January 1999. Additional levels and a two-player mode were eventually removed. The latter feature was scrapped as the developers sought to focus on the single-player mode.

In late 1998, MGM partnered with Electronic Arts to co-publish games such as &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The game was completed on October 29, 1999, and released in North America on November 16, and in the United Kingdom on November 25.

The game includes voice-acting, although none of the film&#x27;s actors reprised their roles. The game&#x27;s musical score was composed by Tommy Tallarico, and was released separately as &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies The Original Soundtrack from the Videogame&quot;. It includes 16 tracks written for the game and a bonus track.

==Reception==
The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Adam Pavlacka of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;Take away the Bond license, and what&#x27;s left is a very basic third-person shooter with little innovation.&quot; In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Electronic Arts Square on February 10, 2000, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 27 out of 40.

Following the success of &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, critics were disappointed with &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, believing that it fell far short of the previous game. Rick Mears of &quot;GameFan&quot; wrote that after &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;did we really ever expect anything to come close?&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Douglass C. Perry wrote, &quot;Despite wanting to avoid comparisons, it&#x27;s nearly impossible for TND to shake the legacy of &quot;Goldeneye&quot;&quot;. Uncle Dust of &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote in one review, &quot;Unfortunate comparisons to &quot;Goldeneye&quot; will probably occur, and to that &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is an inferior game. But on its own &quot;TND&quot; gives you great Bond-style thrills in a less-than-polished package.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Air Hendrix said, &quot;You can&#x27;t beat the marquee value of &quot;007&quot;, so &quot;TND&quot; is worth renting to check its license to kill—even if there is no multiplayer action. Still, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; is no &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, and gamers have come to expect much more from &quot;Bond&quot;.&quot; Scott Alan Marriott, writing for &quot;AllGame&quot;, felt that the game lacked the polishing that would be expected considering its delays. He concluded that the game &quot;makes you appreciate GoldenEye that much more&quot;. Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that unlike &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, each mission in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; &quot;ends on an anticlimactic note, making you think, &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s over?&#x27;&quot;

The game received comparisons to &quot;Syphon Filter&quot;, which some critics deemed superior. The artificial intelligence was criticized, as was the game&#x27;s short length. Critics also complained of problems such as clipping and poor collision detection. Mears stated that walls &quot;become translucent&quot; and &quot;bad guys appear out of nowhere&quot;. The game also received some criticism for its lack of multiplayer.

Marriott found the film-based clips to be short and of little value, while Johnny Liu of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; wrote that much of the film footage &quot;just doesn&#x27;t flow because of the game&#x27;s choppy graphics&quot;.

The camera and controls were criticized as well. Justin Braxton-Brown, writing for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, complained of Bond&#x27;s slow running speed. He also stated that when Bond &quot;attempts a 180-degree turn to face an adversary, gamers end up being shot in the back several times or spinning too far and being shot while trying to locate the enemy Bond just spun past&quot;. Perry stated that &quot;even walking over simple power-ups can be a task&quot;. Marriott complained of Bond&#x27;s limited moves, noting that he cannot jump, climb, or crawl.

Mears commended the game for its inclusion of skiing and driving portions, but also considered them &quot;passable at best&quot;, while Marriott praised them. Perry found the car level to be uninspired and considered the skiing portions to be &quot;the biggest area of missed opportunities&quot;. Liu stated that these portions of the game &quot;aren&#x27;t very well done and don&#x27;t add much. They&#x27;re really just there to proclaim variety&quot;.

The soundtrack was praised by critics, with Mears calling it the game&#x27;s most &quot;astounding&quot; feature. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;a much better value than the horrible excuse for a PlayStation game that it&#x27;s from&quot;.

The game received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 units in the UK.

<doc id="700478" wikidata="Q3935382" url="?curid=700478" title="Rift (album)">
<text>Rift is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Phish, released on February 2, 1993, by Elektra Records. It is a concept album, detailing the experience of a man dreaming about the rift in his relationship with his girlfriend. &quot;Rift&quot; was recorded in September and October 1992 and produced by Barry Beckett. &quot;Rift&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on October 15, 1997.

&quot;Rift&quot; marked the second time that the band had recorded a concept album, but the first—the rock opera–styled &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot;—has never been officially released. 

==Production==
All songs were written by Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall except &quot;Mound&quot; and &quot;Weigh&quot; by bass guitarist Mike Gordon and &quot;Lengthwise&quot; by drummer Jon Fishman.

The instrumental, &quot;All Things Reconsidered&quot;, is an intentional variation on the theme to the National Public Radio news show &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and has been featured on the show itself several times. An orchestral version of the song appears on Trey Anastasio&#x27;s 2004 solo album &quot;Seis De Mayo&quot;.

Gordon stated that &quot;Rift&quot; was &quot;more integrated&quot;, as the different styles of the band were mixed together within each song, rather than between each song like on their previous album, &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot;. Gordon also stated that he thought the album was a &quot;little bit mellower&quot;, and that the songwriting showed more maturity.

===Cover art===
The cover art was created by New York-based painter David Welker, who worked closely with the band during winter 1993 in order to visually depict each of the album&#x27;s tracks in a single image, with the notable exception of &quot;The Horse&quot;. (For this reason, a horse intentionally appears on the cover of Phish&#x27;s next album, &quot;Hoist&quot;.) &quot;Relix&quot; magazine listed &quot;Rift&quot; as one of the ten most iconic album covers of all time in 2007.

===Promotion===
Elektra promoted &quot;Rift&quot; with a videotape sent to college radio stations and record stores that featured a six-minute promotional film about the album.

<text>A Live One is a live album by the American rock band Phish, released on June 27, 1995, by Elektra Records. The album was the band&#x27;s first official live release, their first album to be certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and one of the best-selling releases in their catalog.

==Background and contents==
Although tapes of concerts recorded from the audience had been distributed among Phish&#x27;s fanbase for several years by the time of &quot;A Live One&quot;&#x27;s release, the album marked the first time that the band had officially released live recordings directly from their soundboard masters. The album was named after a question that the band members were often asked by fans: &quot;When are you gonna put out a live one?&quot;.

Each track on the album was recorded at a different live show in the United States with one track taken from the 1994 summer tour and the rest from the fall tour. Although recorded at different venues, the songs are noted in the liner notes as having been recorded at &quot;The Clifford Ball&quot;, a reference to aviator Clifford Ball that the band would use again as the name of their 1996 festival. This decision was made because the band&#x27;s management could not secure the recording rights from every venue featured on the album at the time of its release.

Five of the songs—&quot;Gumbo&quot;, &quot;Slave to the Traffic Light&quot;, &quot;Wilson&quot;, &quot;Simple&quot; and &quot;Harry Hood&quot;—had never appeared on any of Phish&#x27;s studio albums, but all of them were and are regularly performed by the band in concert. &quot;A Live One&quot; marked the first time all five had appeared on an official Phish release. Of those songs, only &quot;Slave to the Traffic Light&quot; would subsequently be released in a studio version, when a recording of the song from 1986 appeared on the 1998 Elektra reissue of the band&#x27;s demo release &quot;The White Tape&quot;. The track &quot;Montana&quot; is a two-minute excerpt from the longform improvisation that followed “Tweezer” during the band&#x27;s show in Bozeman, Montana. On &quot;A Live One&quot;, &quot;Montana&quot; serves as a prelude to the epic &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot;, one of the most well-known versions of that song.

Two of the concerts that were excerpted on &quot;A Live One&quot; were later issued in their entirety by Phish: July 8, 1994 (Featuring the &quot;ALO&quot; version of &quot;Stash&quot;) and November 28, 1994 (Which is the source of the aforementioned &quot;Montana&quot;).

==Tracklist selection==
The track-listing for &quot;A Live One&quot; was selected by the four members of Phish, each of whom reviewed the concert tapes from their 1994 fall tour and drafted a list of personal favorite performances. The band then compiled a master list of 560 song performances that had received mention by at least two of the members, which was further narrowed down to a shortlist of 30 songs, from which the final tracklist was selected.

In addition to utilizing their own selections, Phish involved their fanbase in the compilation of the album. The band posted an official thread on the rec.music.phish Usenet newsgroup, in which the message board&#x27;s users were encouraged to suggest performances they believed should be included. The July 8, 1994, version of &quot;Stash&quot; was brought to the band&#x27;s attention through the thread, and was ultimately chosen for inclusion on the album.

==Sales==
In July 1995, &quot;A Live One&quot; peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, and was their first album to reach the chart&#x27;s Top 20. The album sold nearly 50,000 copies in its first week on sale. &quot;Bouncing Around the Room&quot; and &quot;Gumbo&quot; were both issued as singles, but neither appeared on a Billboard chart.

Phish received its first RIAA award for the album. The RIAA certified the album gold on November 10, 1995, for sales of 500,000 copies, and platinum on October 9, 1997, for sales of over 1 million copies.

<text>The village indigobird (Vidua chalybeata), also known as the steelblue widowfinch or (in U.S. aviculture) the Combassou finch, is a small songbird belonging to the family Viduidae. It is distinguishable from other indigobird species by bill and leg colours, the colour tinge of the male&#x27;s breeding plumage, song, and to lesser extent, the nestling&#x27;s plumage and mouth pattern. The bill colour can be red or white depending on the population, and there is some regional variation in the colour tone of the male&#x27;s plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. This indigobird is found in many open habitats including open woodland, scrub and cultivation, but, as its name implies, it is most readily seen near villages.

==Cycle of life==
It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of red-billed firefinches. Unlike the common cuckoo, it does not destroy the host&#x27;s egg. Typically, 2-4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the firefinch are white, although the indigobird&#x27;s are slightly larger. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.

==Behaviour==
The male village indigobird is territorial, and he has an elaborate courtship flight display. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid sputtering and churring intermingled with mimicry of red-billed firefinch&#x27;s song, especially the characteristic &quot;chick-pea-pea-pea&quot;.

The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.

==Description==

The village indigobird is 11–12 cm in length. The adult male is entirely greenish-black or bluish-black except for his orange-red legs and conical white bill. The female resembles a female house sparrow, with streaked brown upperparts, buff underparts, a whitish supercilium and a yellowish bill, although she also has red legs. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and without a supercilium.

Many of the indigobirds are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. Helpful pointers with the village indigobird are the association with its host species, the red-billed firefinch, and its presence near human habitation.

==Subspecies==
There are six accepted subspecies:
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;chalybeata&quot; – West Africa: Senegambia to central Mali
::Description: Green, greenish-blue, or green-hued male plumage and white bills
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;neumanni&quot; – Mali to South Sudan
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;ultramarina&quot; – Ethiopia and Eritrea
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;centralis&quot; – DRC, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;okavangoensis&quot; – western Angola to northern Botswana
::Description: Red and white-billed birds with blue-hued male plumage
* &quot;V. c.&quot; subsp. &quot;amauropteryx&quot; – coastal East Africa and southeastern Africa
::Description: Red-billed birds with blue-hued male plumage

<doc id="700494" wikidata="Q667377" url="?curid=700494" title="Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class">
<text>The  (model code X204) is a Compact luxury crossover SUV produced from 2008 to 2015, debuting at the 2008 Beijing Auto Show. The name GLK is an acronym for Geländewagen Luxus Kompaktklasse, taking its name from the larger Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, which in turn was named after the G-Wagen or Geländewagen. Thus, the GL is the luxury-oriented version of the G, and GLK is the compact version of the GL.

In 2015, the GLK-Class was replaced by the GLC as per the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name &quot;GL&quot;, followed by the model&#x27;s placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The &quot;G&quot; is for Geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter &quot;L&quot; that acts as a linkage with the letter &quot;C&quot;—the GLC being the SUV equivalent to the C-Class.

==Concept models==
Two concept vehicles appeared in 2008: The Vision GLK Freeside and the Vision GLK Townside. The former was designed to handle light off-road duty, while the latter was intended for exclusively on-road driving.

The Freeside incorporated design aspects of the original Mercedes-Benz G-Class with typical design features from the contemporary Mercedes-Benz passenger car range. The concept included a 2.2-litre BlueTec four-cylinder Diesel engine rated at , 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, 4Matic all-wheel drive, anticipatory Pre-Safe safety concept and the Intelligent Light System (ILS), Command APS infotainment centre, a rear-seat entertainment system with two screens and Thermotronic 3-zone automatic climate control, Agility Control suspension. The vehicle was unveiled in 2008 Detroit Auto Show.

==Production model==
The vehicle&#x27;s design was heavily influenced by the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.

The GLK-Class shares the C-Class W204 platform, and production plans continued after the demise of the similar Smart Formore. The vehicle was unveiled in Auto China 2008.

European models went on sale on June 30, 2008, with deliveries beginning in the autumn the same year. Early German models included GLK 220 CDI 4Matic BlueEfficiency, GLK 320 CDI 4Matic, GLK 280 4Matic, GLK 350 4Matic. GLK Edition 1 models are based on V6 engine models, but include exterior sports package, 20-inch wheels, Easy-Pack tailgate and specially coloured privacy glass in the rear compartment, interior sports package, black/white nappa leather seats from the designo range, AMG multifunction leather steering wheel, a black roof lining, exclusive aluminium trim elements and the Command APS system, calcite white body colour.

GLK 220 CDI BlueEfficiency, GLK 220 CDI 4Matic BlueEfficiency, GLK 300 4Matic, GLK 250 CDI 4Matic BlueEfficiency were introduced in 2009.

At launch in Germany and North America, the car was offered in all-wheel drive only, though a rear-wheel drive only version was added to the range.

The GLK-Class was not sold in RHD markets, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, due to a driveshaft used to operate the front wheels on 4WD versions of the GLK. It is positioned such that it occupies the same space as the steering column for RHD models, and as such the two configurations are not compatible with each other.

===Vision GLK Bluetec Hybrid (2008)===

A concept vehicle demonstrating a Bluetec engine with hybrid module was developed. It includes a four-cylinder Bluetec Diesel engine, maximum electric motor, Alubeam Blue body colour, 20-inch light-alloy wheels, black leather upper dashboard upholstery, Command APS central display, Agility Control suspension.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show.

<text>Slip Stitch and Pass is the second official live album by the American rock band Phish. It was released on October 28, 1997, by Elektra Records and has nine tracks from the band&#x27;s March 1, 1997, show at the Markthalle Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany, which was part of Phish&#x27;s 1997 European Tour.

The album marked the first time that concert staples &quot;Mike&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Weekapaug Groove&quot; had appeared on an official Phish release, despite both having been part of the band&#x27;s repertoire since the 1980s. Three of the album&#x27;s nine songs are cover songs: &quot;Cities&quot; from Talking Heads, &quot;Jesus Just Left Chicago&quot; from ZZ Top and the traditional &quot;a cappella&quot; standard &quot;Hello My Baby&quot;.

In addition, during the final jam segment of &quot;Mike&#x27;s Song&quot;, the band quotes (or &#x27;teases&#x27;) Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; and elements and lyrics from The Doors song &quot;The End&quot;. Both &quot;Lawn Boy&quot; and &quot;Weekapaug Groove&quot; subsequently have lyrics from &quot;The End&quot;. The close of &quot;Weekapaug Groove&quot; interpolates the end section of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot;.

The jam on &quot;Wolfman&#x27;s Brother&quot; is indicative of the band&#x27;s foray into funk music, which dominated the group&#x27;s improvisation over the next several years. The song also includes a tease of the band&#x27;s own instrumental tune &quot;Dave&#x27;s Energy Guide.&quot;

Renowned graphic artist Storm Thorgerson designed the album cover.

<text>The Story of the Ghost is the seventh studio album by American rock band Phish, released by Elektra Records on October 27, 1998. The album features an emphasis on the jazz-funk influenced &quot;cow-funk&quot; style, which the group had been experimenting with in concert throughout 1997 and 1998. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, which was a Top 20 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Adult Alternative Songs chart. The album&#x27;s cover was painted by visual artist George Condo.

==Sound and production==
Much of the album originated during large-scale improvisation sessions. The band then took favorite moments from those in-studio jams and wrote songs around them, adding lyrics from a book of writings by long-time Phish lyricist Tom Marshall. Additional excerpts from the improvisational &quot;Ghost Sessions&quot; were also later released as &quot;The Siket Disc&quot;. The progressive rock song &quot;Guyute&quot; is the only track on the album to pre-date 1997, having first been performed by Phish in 1994.

A few of the album&#x27;s songs reflect the band&#x27;s 1997 &quot;cow-funk&quot; sound, with bass guitarist Mike Gordon taking a more prominent role. Anastasio had coined the &quot;cow-funk&quot; term in the band&#x27;s 1997 official biography &quot;The Phish Book&quot;, observing that &quot;What we’re doing now is really more about groove than funk. Good funk, real funk, is not played by four white guys from Vermont.&quot; Much of the album, however, is defined by what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called an &quot;unhurried vibe ... with airy, uncluttered grooves and relaxed vocals.&quot; Unlike Phish&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot; does not include any instrumentals. &quot;End of Session&quot; was performed live for the first time on July 25, 2017.

Early incarnations of several tracks from the album can be heard on the 2000 release &quot;Trampled by Lambs and Pecked by the Dove&quot;, a collection of song sketches recorded by frontman Trey Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall.

The album was recorded over the course of several sessions at Bearsville Studios in the village of Bearsville, New York, where the band had also recorded &quot;Billy Breathes&quot;. The band chose Andy Wallace to produce the album because of his work on &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; by Slayer, &quot;Nevermind&quot; by Nirvana and &quot;Grace&quot; by Jeff Buckley.

&quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, &quot;Frankie Says&quot;, and &quot;Shafty&quot; (the latter song a reworking of Phish original &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Pool&quot;) were all debuted live during the &quot;Island Tour&quot;, a brief run of shows the band played while taking a break from recording the album in April 1998. All four nights of the &quot;Island Tour&quot; were later released as part of the LivePhish Series.

In 2000, during the promotion for &quot;Farmhouse&quot;, many interviews saw Anastasio citing a certain disdain for the process of creating &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;. He was critical of the band&#x27;s &quot;socialistic&quot; approach to the song selection for the album. &quot;There were songs I thought should have gone on &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot; album, that were better than the songs that got on there&quot;, Anastasio said in a 2000 interview. &quot;If anyone didn&#x27;t like a song it was out. But what happens with that approach is the material gets watered down. You end up with songs that everyone is fine with, but the best songs are usually those where one person is passionately for and one person really hates, because the best songs are those that arouse strong reactions&quot;.

Tom Marshall recalls that one of these stronger songs was omitted in favor of what he felt was a weaker track in &quot;Fikus&quot;. Anastasio named &quot;Bug&quot; and &quot;Twist&quot; as two songs he was disappointed were cut from the album, and both later appeared on &quot;Farmhouse&quot;. In 2018, Marshall had Anastasio as a guest on his &quot;Under the Scales&quot; podcast to discuss the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;, and both conceded they were now happy with the album as it was released, with Marshall revising his opinion of &quot;Fikus&quot; to a more positive one.

In February 2009, &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot; was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

<doc id="700509" wikidata="Q1415642" url="?curid=700509" title="Netherlands Trading Society">
<text>The Netherlands Trading Society ( or NHM) was a Dutch trading and financial company, established in 1824, in The Hague by King William I to promote and develop trade, shipping and agriculture. For the next 140 years the NHM developed a large international branch network and increasingly engaged in banking operations. In 1964, it merged with Twentsche Bank to form Algemene Bank Nederland, itself a predecessor of ABN AMRO.

==History==

The NHM was a private company which issued publicly traded shares. According to the king, the NHM would act to leverage economic activity and encourage the development of national wealth. However, in practice it came down to expanding existing trade, by gathering data and searching for new markets as well as financing industry and shipping. Its close association with the Dutch government meant it played an important role in the development of trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. Its former headquarters in De Bazel in Amsterdam houses the Amsterdam Archives today.

The NHM is sometimes called the successor of the Dutch East India Company or VOC, as it was also a private company that issued shares and financed trade with the Dutch East Indies. The establishment of the NHM can be seen as an attempt to bring new impetus to trade with the Dutch East Indies after the depression of the years of French domination (1795–1814), and the final collapse of the VOC two decades earlier. With playful reference to the greatness of the VOC, the NHM was colloquially known as or the &quot;little company&quot;.

The NHM financing of trade and shipping led to the development of a network of branches which increasingly engaged in financing and banking operations. The network extended throughout South East Asia and on the trade routes between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies and the NHM continued to extend its network into the 20th century. It lost a number of its branches when the Indonesian government nationalised them in 1960 to form a new locally owned bank, but by then had branches in many other parts of the world. 

===Time line===
*1824: King William I created the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM) by Royal Decree to revive trade between the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies.

*1920: NHM opened branches in Bombay (Mumbai) and Calcutta (Kolkata) primarily to work with clients in the diamond business
*1926: NHM opened a branch in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Known later as the Saudi Hollandi Bank (currently Alawwal Bank), it was the first, and until 1948 the only, commercial bank in the Kingdom. The branch existed to serve the needs of Indonesian Muslims coming to perform Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca
*1934: Financial restructuring; NHM reduces its capital by 75 percent
*1936: NHM initiates a retail presence in the Netherlands beyond its previous branches in Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam, by acquiring the Guelders Credit Union ()

==Buildings==

The building at Vijzelstraat 32 in Amsterdam known today as &quot;De Bazel&quot;is named after its architect Karel de Bazel. It was originally built in 1919–1926 for the NHM and it is decorated with many details reminiscent of Indonesia, most notably the brickwork, which earned the building the nickname &quot;spekkoek&quot; It was later repurposed as the Amsterdam Archives.

<doc id="700514" wikidata="Q5435850" url="?curid=700514" title="Farmhouse (album)">
<text>Farmhouse is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Phish. The album was released on May 16, 2000, by Elektra Records. &quot;Farmhouse&quot; was the last Phish studio album before their two-year hiatus between October 2000 and December 2002.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heavy Things&quot;, was one of Phish&#x27;s most successful radio hits; it was the band&#x27;s only song to appear on a mainstream pop radio format, reaching #29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Top 40 chart that July. The song also became the band&#x27;s biggest hit to date on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, reaching #2 there. The song had previously been performed for live broadcast during the overnight set of Phish&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000 show at Big Cypress as part of ABC&#x27;s coverage of New Year&#x27;s festivities around the globe.

Owing in part to the mainstream exposure of &quot;Heavy Things&quot;, &quot;Farmhouse&quot; had the highest-ever first week sales for a Phish record. The album was certified gold by RIAA on January 30, 2006.

==Production==
Songwriting for &quot;Farmhouse&quot; was a joint effort between Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, with contributions from Tony Markellis, Russ Lawton and Scott Herman. All of the songs were already part of Phish&#x27;s live concert song rotation before being recorded for the album, some dating back to 1997. The tracks were recorded at The Barn, frontman Trey Anastasio&#x27;s studio in Chittenden County, Vermont. The introduction to &quot;Piper&quot; is an extract from the band&#x27;s live performance of the song on July 18, 1999, at their Camp Oswego Festival in Volney, New York. There is also a Japanese version of the album available as an import which include two bonus studio out-take tracks from the Farmhouse recording sessions which are &quot;Driver&quot; and &quot;Mist&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Mountains in the Mist&quot;). These two songs are currently not available in any format online by Phish although as of December 2018 it can be purchased in its original CD format on Amazon.com and possibly elsewhere for about twice the price of the standard version of the album.

Early incarnations of several tracks from the album can be heard on the 2000 release &quot;Trampled by Lambs and Pecked by the Dove&quot;, a collection of song sketches and demos recorded by Anastasio and Marshall.

The song &quot;First Tube&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In February 2009, the album was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

A new 2-LP vinyl version of the album was announced on May 31, 2023, for an official release on June 30, 2023, sourced from the original 1/2&quot; master reels. The original version of the record on vinyl was on one single LP, sourced from digital.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Farmhouse&quot; received mainly positive reviews. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic praised the album as Phish&#x27;s &quot;rootsiest and most organic effort to date... [and] also their most fully developed – these are complete, concise songs and not simply outlines for extended jams, boasting a beauty and intimacy which expands the group&#x27;s scope even as it serves notice of a newfound pop accessibility.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Pareles, however, gave &quot;Farmhouse&quot; a mediocre rating of only 2.5 stars. The review states that on the album the band walks &quot;a thin line between mellow and torpid&quot; with songs that &quot;are going to need a lot of live (concert) resuscitation&quot;.

<doc id="700515" wikidata="Q369608" url="?curid=700515" title="Qi Baishi">
<text>Qi Baishi (1 January 1864 – 16 September 1957) was a Chinese painter, noted for the whimsical, often playful style of his works. Born to a peasant family from Xiangtan, Hunan, Qi taught himself to paint, sparked by the Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden. After he turned 40, he traveled, visiting various scenic spots in China. After 1917 he settled in Beijing. Qi was the master of Hu Jieqing, the wife of Lao She.

The subjects of his paintings include almost everything, commonly animals, scenery, figures, toys, vegetables, and so on. He theorized that &quot;paintings must be something between likeness and unlikeness, much like today&#x27;s vulgarians, but not like to cheat popular people&quot;. In his later years, many of his works depict mice, shrimp or birds. He was also good at seal carving and called himself &quot;the rich man of three hundred stone seals&quot; (). In 1953, he was elected president of the China Artists Association (). He died in Beijing in 1957.

==Early life==
He was born in Xiangtan, Hunan. He lived with his parents, grandparents, and eight younger sisters and brothers. Qi was schooled for less than a year due to illness. However, he was too weak to do much of the work and this was when he became a carpenter. While Qi was growing up, he read Chinese manual of painting, which sparked his interest in art and painting animals, insects and other types. In his paintings, he depicted things that people have seen, however, he did not start following this motto until much later in his life. He first studied the &quot;Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden&quot; () and used performers, mainly opera, for models to practice his work. After using opera performers as models, Qi turned to anyone he knew to pose for him.

==Training and education==
“Qi Baishi started receiving artistic training... which consisted of fundamentals in &quot;gongbi&quot; (工筆) mode, which features fine brushwork and meticulous detail”. He was taught that every aspect of painting mattered, from the subject matter to the way the ink was applied to the paper. His landscape paintings came as a result of his next mentor Tan Pu. Because of his training, he then realized that he could pursue art as his full-time career instead of just dreaming to become a professional artist. Despite his training in &quot;gongbi&quot;, Qi is famed for painting in the freely expressive &quot;xieyi&quot; (寫意 ‘sketching thoughts’) style.

Qi was popular for his variety of works ranging from plant to animal life; because of his natural style, collectors both “artistic and political” purchased his work. According to the article, Qi Baishi [Ch’i Pai-shih; &quot;zi&quot; Huang; &quot;hao&quot; Baishi Laoren, Baishi Shanqeng]: &quot;Qi’s works were based on his life and his character. After the fall of the Qing dynasty Qi was known for not letting all the political issues affect his work and keeping his own values and ideas through the harsh times. According to Confucian standards, starting off as nothing and creating a name for yourself, as Qi did, was very honorable.

Qi managed to master many different techniques including calligraphy and seal-carving. After establishing himself in Hunan as a painter and artist, it wasn’t until his forties that he began traveling and looking for more inspiration. Qi came upon the Shanghai School, which was very popular at the time, and met Wu Changshuo who then became another mentor to him and inspired a lot of Qi’s works. Another influence of Qi didn’t come until about fifteen years later who was Chen Shizeng (陳師曾) who he became close to when he was living in Beijing. Qi was becoming more and more well-known and sought after. During World War II, many traditional art works and culture were no longer considered valuable and were thus destroyed. But Qi was still respected and was “elected to the National People’s Congress and made honorary Chairman of the National Artists Association, he represented a continuing commitment to traditional cultural values in revolutionary China”. He died at age 93.

==Settling down==
After all of his travels, Qi built a house and settled down. He began reading and writing poetry and painting some of the mountains he saw while traveling. These paintings became a series of fifty landscape pictures known as “Chieh-shan t’u-chuan.” Later, poems and postscripts by artists that Qi knew were printed onto the paintings. One of Qi&#x27;s earlier series of works called “The Carp” was recognized and praised for its simple style - it contained no excess of decorations or writings. His noticeable talent with wood-carving was also highly praised, as was his ability to express his personal influence through his work. It was not until his mid-fifties that Qi was considered a mature painter. By then, his lines were sharper and his subject matter had changed from wildlife to botany. As said by Wang Chao-Wen, “he based his work on reality while experimenting ceaselessly in new ways of expression, to integrate truth and beauty, create something yet unimagined by other artists, and achieve his own unique style, on that should not be artificial”.

==Experiences and works==
Wang Chao-Wen said that while Qi was talking to a student in Beijing, he saw an outline of a bird on a brick floor in muddy water. He goes on to say that not everyone would have seen the bird, but because Qi was always concerned with finding new images to paint, he had a &quot;special sensitivity&quot;. It was said that Qi had something special about him because he was constantly thinking about painting and had such a strong drive and motivation to be a great artist.
Excerpts from Qi Baishi&#x27;s journal demonstrate the strong passion and conviction he had for his work. From the article &quot;An Appreciation of Chi Pai-Shi&#x27;s Paintings&quot;, his journal entry reads as follows:

What is unique about Qi is that his works show no western influences, unlike most other artists at this time. Other artists praised Qi for the &quot;freshness and spontaneity that he brought to the familiar genres of birds and flowers, insects and grasses, hermit-scholars and landscapes&quot;. Although Qi was not the first artist to focus on small things in nature, he was highly recognized for his thoughtful and lyrical approach in depicting these subjects.

Forgery and misattribution of Qi&#x27;s work has become common in the contemporary art market. He is estimated to have produced between 8,000 and 15,000 distinct works throughout his life, of which 3,000 are in museums. However, since 1993, auction houses have attempted to sell over 18,000 distinct works attributed to him. A painting attributed to him, &quot;Eagle Standing on Pine Tree&quot; (), was sold for 425.5 million yuan ($65.5 million) in 2011, becoming one of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction. However, doubts over the painting&#x27;s authenticity were later raised by the bidder.

The market for Qi&#x27;s paintings has made headlines in the art market, both for China and the world. In 2016, his works held the second position by value (third by number of lots to sale) by auction. At the end of 2017, the art world was rocked by the news that his &quot;Twelve Landscape Screens&quot; (; 1925) catapulted him into the &quot;$100 Million Club&quot; by selling for $140.8 million (931.5 million yuan) at in Beijing.

==Family==

Qi&#x27;s first wife was Chen Chunjun. They got married when Qi was twelve years old in his Hunan hometown. The couple later had five children, three sons: Qi Liangyuan (born 1889), Qi Liangfu (1894–1913) and Qi Liangkun (born 1902) and two daughters (unknown names). 
In 1919, Chen Chunjun came to Beijing and obtained Hu Baozhu (1902–1944) as Qi&#x27;s concubine. From then, Qi and Hu lived together in Beijing. The couple had 7 children together: four sons—Qi Liangchi (born 1921), Qi Liangyi (born 1923), Qi Liangnian (1934–1938) and Qi Liangmo (born 1938)—and 3 daughters—Qi Lianglian (born 1927), Qi Lianghuan (born 1928) and Qi Liangzhi (1931–2010).

==Heritage==
There were/are many painters of Qi&#x27;s young generation:

Qi and Chen&#x27;s children:
* Qi Liangkun (also known Qi Ziru) and his son Qi Kelai.

Qi and Hu&#x27;s children:
* Qi Liangchi, also his son Qi Zhanyi
* Qi Liangyi also his son Qi Bingyi
* Qi Liangmo, also his son Qi Jianxiong and his daughter Qi Huijuan
* Qi Liangzhi, also her son Xiong Zhichun and daughters Xiong Youyou and Qi Yuanyuan

Qi Liangkun, Qi Liangyi, Qi Liangchi, Qi Liangmo and Qi Liangzhi have kept the family tradition ongoing and are actively painting the style learned from Qi Baishi. Xiong Zhichun was taught by Liangmo and Liangzhi, later studied in art academy abroad to form his personal art style.

<doc id="700524" wikidata="Q7764184" url="?curid=700524" title="The Siket Disc">
<text>The Siket Disc is the eighth studio album by the American rock band Phish. The album was released in June 1999 through the band&#x27;s website and mail-order service, and was released commercially by Elektra Records on November 7, 2000. Unlike Phish&#x27;s other records, &quot;The Siket Disc&quot; is completely instrumental, and its songs are excerpts from studio jams recorded during the sessions for &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;The Siket Disc&quot; emerged from material developed during the Bearsville Studio sessions for Phish&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;. Not exactly outtakes or unfinished songs, &quot;The Siket Disc&quot;&#x27;s compositions are actually select excerpts from the long-form improvisation of the &quot;Ghost Sessions&quot;. Phish keyboard player Page McConnell edited and mastered the selections into this compilation, named for engineer John Siket.

The material on &quot;The Siket Disc&quot; is defined by an almost ambient, post-rock sound that is a distinct departure from the band&#x27;s major studio albums. The album is almost completely instrumental, but contains a few instances of vocalization. &quot;Quadrophonic Toppling&quot;, for instance, includes a triggered sample of bass guitarist Mike Gordon repeating the song&#x27;s title.

Only the composition &quot;What&#x27;s the Use?&quot; has been notably incorporated into the band&#x27;s live shows on a somewhat regular basis. (However, &quot;Quadrophonic Toppling&quot;, &quot;My Left Toe&quot;, and &quot;The Happy Whip and Dung Song&quot; have each made at least one live appearance).

Gordon has indicated that &quot;The Siket Disc&quot; became a fixture in the band&#x27;s late night tour bus music rotation in the early 2000s, saying that &quot;It fit the vibe perfectly ... It&#x27;s one of the only instances I can remember when we regularly played our own music.&quot;

In February 2009, this album was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

<doc id="700530" wikidata="Q5877812" url="?curid=700530" title="Hoist (album)">
<text>Hoist (stylized as (HOIST)) is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Phish, released on March 29, 1994, by Elektra Records. At the time of its release, &quot;Hoist&quot; was Phish&#x27;s best selling album to date, peaking at No. 34 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on August 19, 1996, and remains the band&#x27;s best-selling studio release, outsold in their discography only by the platinum-certified &quot;A Live One&quot;.

The album includes &quot;Down with Disease&quot;, the band&#x27;s breakthrough single on American rock radio, reaching the top 40 of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in June 1994. The band filmed their only official music video for the song, directed by bassist Mike Gordon, which received some airplay on MTV.

==Title==
The band suggested a few ideas for the album&#x27;s title before finally settling on &quot;Hoist&quot;; one of the alternative suggestions was &quot;Hung Like a Horse&quot;. The band ruled this out, but decided to keep the visual joke intact for the album&#x27;s cover. The horse is also a reference to &quot;The Horse,&quot; the only song not visually depicted on the cover of &quot;Rift&quot;, the band&#x27;s previous album. The horse on the cover is named Maggie and was owned by the band&#x27;s friend Amy Skelton.

==Production==
Most of the songs on &quot;Hoist&quot; were not played in concert by Phish until after the release of the album. Only &quot;Sample in a Jar&quot; and &quot;Lifeboy&quot; had been played beforehand, both debuting in 1993. &quot;Axilla (Part II)&quot; is a version of the song &quot;Axilla&quot;, which had been debuted in 1992, with new lyrics. Although the band played &quot;Part II&quot; throughout 1994, Phish retired the song in favor of the original version of &quot;Axilla&quot; in 1995. After 1995, Phish did not perform &quot;Part II&quot; again until September 2021. The outro jam segment of &quot;Down with Disease&quot; had been debuted by the band at midnight at their New Year&#x27;s Eve 1993-94 concert, but the entire song was not played live until April 1994.

&quot;Hoist&quot; features guest appearances from Alison Krauss, Béla Fleck, Tower of Power, Rose Stone and a host of other musicians, as well as actor Jonathan Frakes on trombone. With its jazz, blues, soul and bluegrass influences, the album is marked by more stripped-down, straightforward songwriting and pop-friendly hooks, a somewhat new approach for Phish.

However, the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Demand&quot;, segues into an extended eight-minute instrumental excerpt from a live performance of the song &quot;Split Open and Melt&quot; from the band&#x27;s April 21, 1993, concert at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, Ohio. The &quot;Split&quot; jam is then abruptly cut off by the sound of a car crash followed by the first verse and refrain of the Hebrew song &quot;Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold).&quot;

&quot;Riker&#x27;s Mailbox&quot; is a brief interlude track on the album, and the only &quot;song&quot; on the album to have never been performed live by the band. Album producer Paul Fox lived next to Jonathan Frakes, whose mailbox is apparently uniquely decorated. Frakes, who played Commander Riker on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, sat in for a while during the &quot;Hoist&quot; sessions, giving his name to the track. The &quot;Riker&#x27;s Mailbox&quot; track is extracted from a longer take of the song &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, which had been recorded during the &quot;Hoist&quot; sessions but did not make the album&#x27;s tracklist.

On June 26, 1994, the band performed the entire &quot;Hoist&quot; album (minus &quot;Riker&#x27;s Mailbox&quot; but including the &quot;Split Open and Melt&quot; jam) verbatim as the second set of their live show in Charleston, West Virginia. The first set of the concert had featured the band performing their &quot;Gamehendge&quot; song suite in its entirety, and as a result, the concert is known by fans as the &quot;GameHoist&quot; show. This move was a subversion of Phish&#x27;s usual improvisationally driven performances, and the concert later inspired the band&#x27;s tradition of donning a musical costume for Halloween.

In February 2009, this album became available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.

<text>The pin-tailed whydah (Vidua macroura) is a small songbird with a conspicuous pennant-like tail in breeding males. It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert.

==Taxonomy==
The pin-tailed whydah was first described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Fringilla macroura&quot;.

==Description==

The pin-tailed whydah is 12–13 cm in length, although the breeding male&#x27;s tail adds another 20 cm to this. The adult male has a black back and crown, and a very long black tail. The wings are dark brown with white patches, and the underparts and the head, apart from the crown, are white. The bill is bright red. The female and non-breeding male have streaked brown upperparts, whitish underparts with buff flanks, and a buff and black face pattern. They lack the long tail extension, but retain the red bill. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and with a greyish bill.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pin-tailed whydah occurs in much of sub-Saharan Africa, favouring grassland, scrubs and savannah, also coming into parks and gardens. In Portugal it is established in the region around Aveiro, with observations occurring north and south of it. It has been introduced to southern California, with a sizable population existing there, as well as Puerto Rico and Singapore. It is also widely kept as a cage bird elsewhere, with occasional escapes and releases.

==Ecology==

The species is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches, especially waxbills. Unlike the common cuckoo, it does not destroy the host&#x27;s eggs. Typically, 2–4 eggs are added to those already present. The eggs of both the host and the whydah are white, although the whydah&#x27;s are slightly larger. The nestling whydahs mimic the gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.

The male pin-tailed whydah is territorial, and one male often has several females in his small group. He has an elaborate courtship flight display, which includes hovering over the female to display his tail. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid squeaking and churring. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.

<text>Round Room is the tenth studio album by the American rock band Phish released on December 10, 2002, by Elektra Records.

The album was recorded over the span of four days in October 2002, and its release marked the end of the group&#x27;s two year hiatus from touring and recording.

==Production and release==
Initially, Phish planned to record the album live at their December 31, 2002 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, their first concert since October 2000, but they decided instead to release the songs they had recorded that fall instead.

As with previous Phish albums, the songs originated in collaborative writing sessions between frontman Trey Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall (with two songs contributed by bass guitarist Mike Gordon). &quot;Round Room&quot; is unique, however, in that the final tracks were taken from the band&#x27;s unedited rehearsal sessions at The Barn, Anastasio&#x27;s studio in Vermont. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that this approach gives the album a &quot;decidedly live&quot; feeling, and &quot;breathes with an anxious, edge-of-the-seat intensity that&#x27;s missing from their previous studio efforts.&quot; Though largely positive, the review criticizes Anastasio&#x27;s singing and the &quot;Phishspeak&quot; quality of the lyrics.

In the liner notes for the album, &quot;Round Room&quot; is dedicated to the memory of Widespread Panic guitarist Michael Houser, who died in August 2002, and Scott Schertzer, a Phish fan who was killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Phish appeared on TV twice before their official return to the stage on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002. &quot;46 Days&quot; was debuted live on the December 14, 2002, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and &quot;All of These Dreams&quot; debuted five days later on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

About a week after the release of &quot;Round Room&quot;, Phish recorded an impromptu jam session in a studio in New York City, excerpts of which were later scheduled for release as &quot;The Victor Disc&quot;. However, this instrumental album has not yet been officially released.

<doc id="700550" wikidata="Q786600" url="?curid=700550" title="Procalcitonin">
<text>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a peptide precursor of the hormone calcitonin, the latter being involved with calcium homeostasis. It arises once preprocalcitonin is cleaved by endopeptidase. It was first identified by Leonard J. Deftos and Bernard A. Roos in the 1970s. It is composed of 116 amino acids and is produced by parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid and by the neuroendocrine cells of the lung and the intestine.

The level of procalcitonin in the blood stream of healthy individuals is below the limit of detection (0.01 μg/L) of clinical assays. The level of procalcitonin rises in a response to a pro-inflammatory stimulus, especially of bacterial origin. It is therefore often classed as an acute phase reactant. The induction period for procalcitonin ranges from 4–12 hours with a half-life spanning anywhere from 22–35 hours. It does not rise significantly with viral or non-infectious inflammations. In the case of viral infections this is due to the fact that one of the cellular responses to a viral infection is to produce interferon gamma, which also inhibits the initial formation of procalcitonin. With the inflammatory cascade and systemic response that a severe infection brings, the blood levels of procalcitonin may rise multiple orders of magnitude with higher values correlating with more severe disease. However, the high procalcitonin levels produced during infections are not followed by a parallel increase in calcitonin or a decrease in serum calcium levels.

== Biochemistry ==
PCT is a member of the calcitonin (CT) superfamily of peptides. It is a peptide of 116 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 14.5 kDa, and its structure can be divided into three sections (see Figure 1): amino terminus (represented by the ball and stick model in Figure 1), immature calcitonin (shown in Figure 1 from PDB as the crystal structure of procalcitonin is not yet available), and calcitonin carboxyl-terminus peptide 1. Under normal physiological conditions, active CT is produced and secreted in the C-cells of the thyroid gland after proteolytic cleavage of PCT, meaning, in a healthy individual, that PCT levels in circulation are very low (&lt;.05 ng/mL). The pathway for production of PCT under normal and inflammatory conditions are shown in Figure 2. During inflammation, LPS, microbial toxin, and inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, induce the CALC-1 gene in adipocytes, but PCT never gets cleaved to produce CT. In a healthy individual, PCT in endocrine cells is produced by CALC-1 by elevated calcium levels, glucocorticoids, CGRP, glucagon, or gastrin, and is cleaved to form CT, which is released to the blood.

PCT is located on the CALC-1 gene on chromosome 11. Bacterial infections induce a universal increase in the CALC-1 gene expression and a release of PCT (&gt;1 μg/mL). Expression of this hormone occurs in a site specific manner. In healthy and non-infected individuals, transcription of PCT only occurs in neuroendocrine tissue, except for the C cells in the thyroid. The formed PCT then undergoes post-translational modifications, resulting in the production small peptides and mature CT by removal of the C-terminal glycine from the immature CT by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). In a microbial infected individual, non-neuroendocrine tissue also secretes PCT by expression of CALC-1. A microbial infection induces a substantial increase in the expression of CALC-1, leading to the production of PCT in all differentiated cell types. The function of PCT synthesized in nonneuroendocrine tissue due to a microbial infection is currently unknown, but, its detection aids in the differentiation of inflammatory processes.

== Diagnostic advantages ==
Due to PCT’s variance between microbial infections and healthy individuals, it has become a marker to improve identification of bacterial infection and guide antibiotic therapy. The table below is a summary from Schuetz, Albrich, and Mueller, summarizing the current data of selected, relevant studies investigating PCT in different types of infections.

Legend:&lt;br&gt;
✓ = Moderate evidence in favor of PCT&lt;br&gt;
✓✓ = Good evidence in favor of PCT&lt;br&gt;
✓✓✓ = Strong evidence in favor of PCT&lt;br&gt;
~ = Evidence in favor or against the use of PCT, or still undefined

==Medical uses==

===Sepsis===
Measurement of procalcitonin can be used as a marker of severe sepsis caused by bacteria and generally grades well with the degree of sepsis, although levels of procalcitonin in the blood are very low. PCT has the greatest sensitivity (90%) and specificity (91%) for differentiating patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from those with sepsis, when compared with IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, CRP and TNF-alpha. Evidence is emerging that procalcitonin levels can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing to people with lower respiratory tract infections. Currently, procalcitonin assays are widely used in the clinical environment.

A meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 70% for bacteremia.

A 2018 systematic review comparing PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) found PCT to have a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 77% in identifying septic patients. In the study, PCT outperformed CRP in diagnostic accuracy of predicting sepsis.

In a 2018 meta-analysis of randomized trials of over 4400 ICU patients with sepsis, researchers concluded that PCT led therapy resulted in lower mortality and lower antibiotic administration.

=== Organ rejection ===
Immune responses to both organ rejection and severe bacterial infection can lead to similar symptoms such as swelling and fever that can make initial diagnosis difficult. To differentiate between acute rejection of an organ transplant and bacterial infections, plasma procalcitonin levels have been proposed as a potential diagnostic tool. Typically the levels of procalcitonin in the blood remain below 0.5 ng/mL in cases of acute organ rejection, which has been stated previously to be well below the 1 μg/mL typically seen in bacterial infection.

===Respiratory illnesses===
Given procalcitonin is a blood marker for bacterial infections, evidence shows that it is a useful tool in guiding the initiation and duration of antibiotics in patients with bacterial pneumonia and other acute respiratory infections. The use of procalcitonin guided antibiotic therapy leads to lower mortality, less antibiotic usage, decreased side effects due to antibiotics and promotes good antibiotic stewardship. The value in these protocols are evident since a high PCT level correlates with increased mortality in critically ill pneumonia patients especially those with a low CURB-65 pneumonia risk factor score.

In adults with acute respiratory infections, a 2017 systematic review found that PCT-guided therapy reduced mortality, reduced antibiotic use (2.4 fewer days of antibiotics) and led to decreased adverse drug effects across a variety of clinical settings (ED, ICU, primary care clinic).

Procalcitonin-guided treatment limits antibiotic exposure with no increased mortality in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Using procalcitonin to guide protocol in acute asthma exacerbation led to reduction in prescriptions of antibiotics in primary care clinics, emergency departments and during hospital admission. This was apparent without an increase in ventilator days or risk of intubation. Be that acute asthma exacerbation is one condition that leads to overuse of antibiotics worldwide, researchers concluded that PCT could help curb over-prescribing.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
PCT serves a marker to help differentiate acute respiratory illness such as infection from an acute cardiovascular concern. It also has value as a prognostic lab value in patients with atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease as its levels correlate with the severity of the illness.

The European Society of Cardiology recently released a PCT-guided algorithm for administering antibiotics in patients with dyspnea and suspected acute heart failure. The guidelines use a cut off point of .2 ng/mL and above as the point at which to give antibiotics. This coincides with a 2017 review of literature which concluded that PCT can help reduce antibiotic overuse in patients presenting with acute heart failure. In regards to mortality, a meta analysis of over 5000 patients with heart failure concluded that elevated PCT was reliable in predicting short term mortality.

=== Meningitis ===
Blood procalcitonin levels can help confirm bacterial meningitis and. if negative, can effectively rule out bacterial meningitis. This was shown in a review of over 2000 patients in which PCT had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 80% for cerebrospinal fluid PCT. Blood PCT measurements proved superior to cerebrospinal fluid PCT with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 97% as a marker for bacterial meningitis.

In acute meningitis, serum PCT is useful as a biomarker for sepsis. It can also be of use in determining viral meningitis versus bacterial meningitis. These findings are the result of a 2018 literature review. This followed a 2015 meta analysis that showed that PCT had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 98% in judging viral versus bacterial meningitis. PCT also outperformed other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein.

=== Gastrointestinal disease ===
Evidence shows that an elevated PCT above .5 ng/mL could help diagnose infectious complications of inflammatory bowel disease such as abdominal abscesses, bacterial enterocolitis etc. PCT can be effective in early recognition of infections in IBD patients and decisions on whether to prescribe antibiotics.

===Kidney disease===

Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease are at higher risk for infections, and procalcitonin has been studied in these populations, who often have higher levels. Procalcitonin can be dialyzed, and so levels are dependent upon when patients receive hemodialysis. While there is no formally accepted cutoff value for patients undergoing HD, using a value of greater or equal to 0.5 ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 97-98% and a specificity of 70-96%.

===Hepatitis===

PCT, possibly together with CRP, is used to corroborate the MELD score.

=== Septic arthritis ===
PCT at a cutoff value of .5 ng/mL was effective at ruling in septic arthritis in an analysis of over 8000 patients across 10 prospective studies. PCT had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 95%. The study also concluded that PCT outperforms C-reactive protein in differentiating septic arthritis from non-septic arthritis.

=== Cancer ===
A 2016 literature review showed that PCT has good value in diagnosing infections in oncologic patients. Moreso, it is especially effective in diagnosing major life threatening episodes in cancer patient such as bacteremia and sepsis. Procalcitonin is reliable to monitor recurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma. In detecting cancer recurrence, PCT had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 96% respectively.

=== Pediatrics ===
In a meta analysis of 17 studies, PCT had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 54% in diagnosing sepsis in neonates and children. The PCT cut off used was between 2-2.5 ng/mL.

In children presenting with fever without an apparent source, a PCT level of .5 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 86%. At a 5 ng/mL value, the sensitivity and specificity were 61% and 94%. PCT can help the clinical decision making while identifying invasive bacterial infection in children with unexplained fever.

PCT levels correlate with the degree of illness in pediatric patients with sepsis or urinary tract infections making it effective as a prognostic lab value in these patients.

=== Antibiotic stewardship ===
Procalcitonin guided cessation of antibiotic use reduces duration of antibiotic exposure and lowers mortality in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit.

In adult emergency department patients with respiratory tract illnesses, PCT-guided treatment groups had reduced antibiotic use. PCT references ranges are also used to determine the likelihood a patient has systemic infection (sepsis), thereby reducing incidence of unnecessary antibiotic use in cases where sepsis is unlikely.

Although some literature differs in antibiotic cessation requirements the general consensus is stopping antibiotics when procalcitonin levels fall 80% below peak or below 0.5 μg/L at day five or later during antibiotic therapy.

==PCT and amphetamines==
Excessive overdose on amphetamine or its analogs can induce systemic inflammation; in a case report of amphetamine overdose, without bacterial infection, significant elevations in procalcitonin were observed.

<text>The Smithsonian Institution Building, more commonly known as the Smithsonian Castle or simply The Castle, is a building on the National Mall housing the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s administrative offices and information center. Built as the first Smithsonian museum building, it is constructed of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style (a recalling of a 12th-century combination of late Romanesque and early Gothic motifs; built in the Gothic and Romanesque revival styles). It was completed in 1855 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

==History==
The Castle was the first Smithsonian building, designed by architect James Renwick Jr., whose other works include St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City and the Smithsonian&#x27;s Renwick Gallery, also in Washington D.C. The building committee held a nationwide design competition in 1846 and selected Renwick&#x27;s design by a unanimous vote. Renwick&#x27;s second design, which was Gothic Revival in style, was used in the design of Trinity Episcopal Church. A cardboard model of Renwick&#x27;s winning design survives and is on display in the Castle. Renwick was assisted by Robert Mills, particularly in the internal arrangement of the building.
Initially intended to be built in white marble, then in yellow sandstone, the architect and building committee finally settled on Seneca red sandstone from the Seneca Quarry in Montgomery County, Maryland. The redstone was substantially less expensive than granite or marble, and while initially easy to work, was found to harden to a satisfactory degree on exposure to the elements. Scholarly evidence indicates it is likely that slaves were employed at Seneca in quarrying stone for the Castle, though no evidence has surfaced that slaves were involved in the actual Castle construction.

The building committee selected Gilbert Cameron as the general contractor, and construction began in 1847. The East Wing was completed in 1849 and occupied by Secretary Joseph Henry and his family. The West Wing was completed later the same year. A structural collapse in 1850 of partly completed work raised questions of workmanship and resulted in a change to fireproof construction. The Castle&#x27;s exterior was completed in 1852; Renwick&#x27;s work was completed and he withdrew from further participation. Cameron continued the interior work, which he completed in 1855. Construction funds came from &quot;accrued interest on the Smithson bequest.&quot;

Despite the upgraded fireproof construction, a fire in 1865 caused extensive damage to the upper floor of the building, destroying the correspondence of James Smithson, Henry&#x27;s papers, two hundred oil paintings of American Indians by John Mix Stanley, the Regent&#x27;s Room and the lecture hall, and the contents of the public libraries of Alexandria, Virginia and Beaufort, South Carolina, confiscated by Union forces during the American Civil War. The ensuing renovation was undertaken by local Washington architect Adolf Cluss in 1865–67. Further fireproofing work ensued in 1883, also by Cluss, who by this time had designed the neighboring Arts and Industries Building. A third and fourth floor were added to the East Wing, and a third floor to the West Wing. Electric lighting was installed in 1895.

Around 1900, the wooden floor of the Great Hall was replaced with terrazzo and a Children&#x27;s Museum was installed near the south entrance. A tunnel connected to the Arts and Industries Building. A general renovation took place in 1968–70 to install modern electrical systems, elevators and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The Enid A. Haupt Garden was dedicated in 1987, along with the Renwick Gate facing Independence Avenue, built from Seneca redstone retrieved from the demolished D.C. Jail.

In February 2023, the Castle closed for a planned five-year renovation. The project would include restoration of many aspects of the building, and removal of an upper floor of offices to restore the Grand Hall to its original appearance.

==Description==
Renwick designed the Castle as the focal point of a picturesque landscape on the National Mall using elements from Georg Moller&#x27;s &quot;Denkmäler der deutschen Baukunst&quot;. Renwick originally intended to detail the building with entirely American sculptural flora in the manner of Benjamin Henry Latrobe&#x27;s work at the United States Capitol, but the final work used conventional pattern-book designs.

The building is completed in the Gothic Revival style with Romanesque motifs. This style was chosen to evoke the Collegiate Gothic in England and the ideas of knowledge and wisdom. The façade is built with red sandstone from the Seneca quarry in Seneca, Maryland in contrast to the granite, marble and yellow sandstone from the other major buildings in Washington, D.C.

The building comprises a central section, two extensions or ranges, and two wings. Four towers contain occupiable space, while five smaller towers are primarily decorative, although some contain stairs. As constructed, the central section contained the main entry and museum space (now the Great Hall), with a basement beneath and a large lecture room above. Two galleries on the second floor were used to display artifacts and art. This area is now the Visitor&#x27;s Information and Associates&#x27; Reception area. The East Range contained laboratory space on the first floor and research space on the second. The East Wing contained storage space on the first floor and a suite of rooms on the second as an apartment for the Secretary of the Smithsonian. This space is currently used as administrative offices and archives. The West Range was one story and used as a reading room. The West Wing, known as the chapel, was used as a library. The West Wing and Range are now used as a quiet room for visitors.

On the exterior, the principal tower on the south side is high and square. On the north side there are two towers, the taller on tall. A campanile at the northeast corner is square and tall.

The plan allowed for expansion at either end, a major reason for the informal medieval-inspired design, which would not suffer if asymmetrically developed.

==Current use==
The Smithsonian Castle houses the administrative offices of the Smithsonian. The main Smithsonian visitor center is also located here, with interactive displays and maps. Computers electronically answer most common questions. A crypt just inside the north entrance houses the tomb of James Smithson.

<doc id="700568" wikidata="Q570460" url="?curid=700568" title="Answers in Genesis">
<text>Answers in Genesis (AiG) is an American fundamentalist Christian apologetics parachurch organization. It advocates young Earth creationism on the basis of its literal, historical-grammatical interpretation of the Book of Genesis and the Bible as a whole. Out of belief in biblical inerrancy, it rejects the results of scientific investigations that contradict their view of the Genesis creation narrative and instead supports pseudoscientific creation science. The organization sees evolution as incompatible with the Bible and believes anything other than the young Earth view is a compromise on the principle of biblical inerrancy.

AiG began as the Creation Science Foundation in 1980, following the merger of two Australian creationist groups. Its name changed to Answers in Genesis in 1994, when Ken Ham founded its United States branch. In 2006, the branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa split from the US and UK to form Creation Ministries International. In 2007, AiG opened the Creation Museum, a facility that promotes young-Earth creationism, and in 2016, the organization opened the Ark Encounter, a Noah&#x27;s Ark-themed amusement park. AiG also publishes websites, magazines, journals, and a streaming service, and its employees have published books.

==Organization==

Answers in Genesis resulted from the merging of two Australian creationist organizations in 1980, one led by John Mackay and Ken Ham (Creation Science Supplies and Creation Science Educational Media Services) and the other by Carl Wieland (Creation Science Association). The organization later became known as Answers in Genesis. It is based in Petersburg, Kentucky, and has international offices in Australia, Canada, Peru, and the United Kingdom. Following turmoil in 2005, the AiG network split in 2006. The US and UK branches retained the AiG name and control of the AiG website under Ham&#x27;s leadership. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and South African branches rebranded themselves as Creation Ministries International (CMI). In 2007, CMI filed suit against AiG-USA alleging a variety of wrongdoings, including publicly defaming their organization. In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute.

In June 2006, Answers in Genesis launched the &quot;Answers&quot; magazine in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by the &quot;Answers Research Journal&quot; in 2008, which was widely criticized in the media and scientific circles. Also in 2006, the National Religious Broadcasters awarded Answers in Genesis their Best Ministry Website award. In May 2007, AiG launched the Creation Museum in the United States. The museum received criticism from the National Center for Science Education and petitions of protest from the scientific community.

==Views and activities==
From the outset, Ken Ham did not share the interest of other groups promoting creation science in aiming to produce evidence supporting young Earth creationism, although Answers in Genesis still maintains that &quot;creation science is real science&quot;. Instead, Answers in Genesis focuses on presenting evangelicalism as an all-out battle of their biblical worldview against a perceived naturalistic scientific worldview. Ham&#x27;s message has had three central points:

* that teaching of evolution is an evil causing damage to society;
* that the first eleven chapters of the Book of Genesis give a precise description of the process of creation of the universe and provide direct instruction on the organization of society;
* that proper Christians must engage in a total conflict battling against atheistic humanism.

Answers in Genesis messages promote central young-Earth creationist doctrines, including the concepts of literal Creation of the Earth in six 24-hour days and effects of a global flood. Still, they focus mainly on accepting the authority of their particular literal reading of the Bible as a precondition for eternity in heaven. They present this as choosing one&#x27;s personal ultimate authority for truth, with God&#x27;s Word and human reason being the two possible options, and those choosing the latter over the former liable to perishment. They hence introduce the concept of &quot;biblical reasoning&quot;, where one is &quot;never to attempt to reason in opposition to the Word of God&quot;, and thus claim that this biblical reasoning and biblical faith &quot;work very well together&quot;.

The Answers in Genesis organization rejects key scientific facts and theories as established by archeology, cosmology, geology, paleontology, and evolutionary biology and argues that the universe, the Earth and life originated about 6,000 years ago. (Creationism beliefs reject natural causes and events in scientific explanations of nature and of the origin of the universe in favor of the supernatural, and the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that creationism is religion.)

A book published by one of AiG&#x27;s employees in 2006 accused Hollywood of using subtle tactics to slip &quot;evolutionary content&quot; into &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, affirming that &quot;As Christians we need to reflect the Bible&#x27;s standards and not Hollywood&#x27;s perverted version of reality.&quot;

In 2020, AiG launched its own streaming service, Answers.tv, intended as an alternative to Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming platforms.

AiG has objected to the James Webb Space Telescope, saying &quot;Sadly, many in this particular camp (sometimes ignorantly) have actually compromised Scripture by accepting the secular ideas being pushed by the JWST media at NASA (i.e., the big bang and evolution), thus rejecting the plain (biblical) reading of Genesis 1 and instead reinterpreting the days of creation to long ages. This is an unbiblical way of thinking that essentially elevates man&#x27;s fallible ideas as the ultimate standard (i.e., humanism) over the infallible Word of God&quot;.

===Creation Museum===
AiG&#x27;s Creation Museum is a museum displaying a Young-Earth creationist worldview and pseudoarchaeology. The facility has received much criticism from the scientific and religious communities, as well as from cultural commentators. The Creation Museum opened May 27, 2007, at a cost of $27 million raised entirely by private donations. The displays were created by Patrick Marsh, known for work on Universal Studios Florida attractions for King Kong and Jaws.

A. A. Gill, a British writer and critic, described the museum as &quot;battling science and reason since 2007&quot;, writing: &quot;This place doesn&#x27;t just take on evolution—it squares off with geology, anthropology, paleontology, history, chemistry, astronomy, zoology, biology, and good taste. It directly and boldly contradicts most and all including most theology.&quot;

In 2012 a report noted that &quot;public fascination&quot; with the Creation Museum was &quot;fading&quot;. In November 2012 AiG reported that attendance for the year ended June 30 came to 254,074, which represented a 10 percent drop from the previous year and the attraction&#x27;s &quot;fourth straight year of declining attendance and its lowest annual attendance yet&quot;. By mid-2015, 2.4 million people had visited the museum (about 340,000 visitors over seven years), and in 2017, AiG reported that in the year since its other attraction, the Ark Encounter, opened, the Creation Museum saw over 800,000 visitors, nearly triple the annual average of 300,000 visitors.

===Ark Encounter===
Answers in Genesis opened Ark Encounter, a theme-park, in Grant County, Kentucky on July 7, 2016. The centerpiece of the park is a full-scale model of Noah&#x27;s Ark at long and high. After a visit to Ark Encounter, Bill Nye, who had previously debated Ham, described his experience as &quot;much more troubling or disturbing than [he] thought it would be&quot; and stated that &quot;on the Ark&#x27;s third deck, every single science exhibit is absolutely wrong&quot;. In December 2016, for the holiday season, AiG lit the Ark with rainbow colors, aiming to &quot;reclaim the symbol from the gay rights movement&quot; and to remind viewers of the Noahic covenant.

By late October 2016, over 400,000 people had visited the attraction. This contrasts a state study that projected the attraction would receive 325,000 to under 500,000 visitors in the first year. AiG reported that the Ark Encounter in its first year of operation attracted over 1 million visitors and aggregated 1.5 million total visitors for both the Ark and the Creation Museum.

==Workforce==
In 2007 about 160 people including a chaplain worked at the Creation Museum (a division of AiG, so these were AiG employees) and another 140 people worked at the attached AiG headquarters. Each permanent employee of AiG including people who work at the museum must sign a statement of faith &quot;in order to preserve the function and integrity of the ministry&quot;, indicating that they believe in young Earth creationism and the other teachings of Answers in Genesis. These include &quot;Scripture teaches a recent origin for man and the whole creation&quot;, &quot;the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman&quot;, &quot;the great Flood of Genesis was an actual historic event&quot; and &quot;no apparent, perceived or claimed evidence in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the Scriptural record&quot;. When applying for work a written statement of one&#x27;s beliefs is required along with résumé and references. In 2007, &quot;The Kentucky Post&quot; reported that the Creation Museum employed between 10 and 20 security guards armed with .40 caliber Glock handguns and three certified law enforcement canines.

Creationist geologist Andrew A. Snelling started working with AiG in 2007 as its director of research.

==Reception==
Creation science, which is supported by AiG, is a pseudoscience that &quot;lacks the central defining characteristic of all modern scientific theories&quot;. Scientific and scholarly organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, Paleontological Society, Geological Society of America, Australian Academy of Science, and the Royal Society of Canada have issued statements against the teaching of creationism. The National Center for Science Education, a science advocacy group, criticize AiG&#x27;s promotion of non-science. In direct response to AiG, No Answers in Genesis is a website maintained by members of the Australian Skeptics and retired civil servant John Stear for the purpose of rebutting claims made by AiG.

Astronomer Hugh Ross&#x27;s organization Reasons To Believe, a progressive creationist organization, is a critic of Answers in Genesis. The BioLogos Foundation, which promotes evolutionary creationism, has stated that the views of Answers in Genesis have &quot;force[d] many thoughtful Christians to lose their faith&quot;, while The Biologos Foundation &quot;protect[s the Christian] faith&quot;. In 2011 skeptic Brian Dunning listed it as #5 on his &quot;Top 10 Worst Anti-Science Websites&quot; list.

===Richard Dawkins interview===
In 1998, Answers in Genesis filmed an interview with Richard Dawkins, a prominent evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, resulting in a controversial video that AiG posted on its website. Dawkins addressed it in the essay: &quot;The &#x27;Information Challenge, published in &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot; in 2003. The &quot;suspiciously amateurish&quot; interview included, according to Dawkins, &quot;the kind of question only a creationist would ask in that way&quot; (namely, to &quot;give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome&quot;). Realizing that he had been duped, Dawkins, at his admission, was angry at the thought and initially refused to answer the question but relented and continued the interview. Dawkins wrote: &quot;My generosity was rewarded in a fashion that anyone familiar with fundamentalist tactics might have predicted. When I eventually saw the film a year later, I found that it had been edited to give the false impression that I was incapable of answering the question about information content. In fairness, this may not have been quite as intentionally deceitful as it sounds. You have to understand that these people really believe that their question cannot be answered!&quot;

The Australian Skeptics wrote that AIG edited the film to give the appearance that Dawkins was unable to &quot;give an example of a genetic mutation or an evolutionary process which can be seen to increase the information in the genome&quot; and that a segment that shows him pausing for 11 seconds was a film of him considering whether to expel the interviewer from the room for not revealing her creationist sympathies at the outset. Dawkins reported to the Australian Skeptics that the interviewer shown in the finished film was not the same person who had originally asked the questions. Dawkins and Barry Williams also said that AIG had subsequently changed the question to make it look like Dawkins, who answered the original question put to him, was unable to answer.

===Anti-atheism billboards===
In the spring of 2009, Answers in Genesis posted a billboard in Texas with a young boy aiming a gun towards the viewer with the words, &quot;If God doesn&#x27;t matter to him, do you?&quot; The same image was used in a TV ad. In 2014, the organization purchased space in Times Square to run a 15-second video advertisement addressed &quot;To all of our intolerant liberal friends&quot;. According to AiG, the goal of the billboard was to &quot;challenge the secularists who are increasingly intolerant of the Christian message&quot;. The Christian &quot;Relevant Magazine&quot; described the ad as &quot;passive-aggressive&quot; and &quot;weirdly combative&quot;.

===Great Homeschool Conventions===
In March 2011, the Board of Great Homeschool Conventions, Inc. (a young-Earth Christian group) voted to disinvite Ken Ham and AiG from future conventions due to Ham&#x27;s words about other Christians making &quot;unnecessary, ungodly, and mean-spirited statements that are divisive at best and defamatory at worst&quot;. The controversy stemmed from Ham&#x27;s commentary on the position expressed by Peter Enns, of The BioLogos Foundation, who advocated a symbolic rather than a literal interpretation of the fall of Adam and Eve. Writing on his blog, Ham accused Enns of espousing &quot;outright liberal theology that totally undermines the authority of the Word of God&quot;, which led to his invitation being revoked.

===Legal action by Creation Ministries International===
On May 31, 2007, Creation Ministries International filed a lawsuit in Supreme Court of Queensland against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis seeking damages and accusing him of &quot;unbiblical/unethical/unlawful behaviour&quot; in his dealings with the Australian organization. Before the split, the Australian group had been producing periodicals, &quot;Creation&quot; magazine and &quot;Journal of Creation&quot;, which were then distributed in other countries by local groups. The Australian group had no access to the list of subscribers in the US. AiG discontinued the distribution arrangement, and produced a new magazine of their own, called &quot;Answers&quot;, and represented that to subscribers as a replacement. Creation Ministries International claimed $252,000 (US) in damages for lost revenue by misleading and deceptive conduct in relating to lost subscriptions. 

An editorial analysis of the situation, including reference to estranged co-founder John Mackay&#x27;s allegations in 1986 of necrophilia and witchcraft against Ken Ham&#x27;s personal secretary is offered in an account in the &quot;Reports of the National Center for Science Education&quot;. In February 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered Australian-based Creation Ministries International into arbitration with Answers in Genesis over copyrights and control of affiliates in other countries. In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute.
