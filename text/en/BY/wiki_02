<text>Teracom Group [[Aktiebolag|AB]] is a Swedish state-owned company that delivers information and communication services aimed at operators of essential functions within the Swedish civilian and military systems.

Teracom was established in 1992, as a spin-off from the Swedish Televerket telecommunications agency, ahead of its corporatisation into the Swedish incumbent operator Telia. The reason behind the spin-off was to separate what became Teracom from the commercial aspect of the now-deregulated Swedish telecom business. In October 2018, Teracom sold its Danish subsidiary (Teracom A/S) to the London-based investment company Agilitas Private Equity LLP, which subsequently changed the latter&#x27;s name to Cibicom A/S in January 2019. In 2019, Teracom acquired the Swedish subsidiary of the mobile wireless broadband operator Net 1, now Teracom Mobil AB. The background to Teracom&#x27;s acquisition of Net 1 was to secure telecommunications via mobile broadband to authorities and companies via the 450 MHz band with government control and in the long term.

<doc id="691579" wikidata="Q5727007" url="?curid=691579" title="Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester">
<text>Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, PC, FRS, FRCP (March 16068 December 1680) was an English peer. He was the son of Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull, and his wife, the former Gertrude Talbot, daughter of George Talbot and Elizabeth Reyner, and cousin of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

==Career==

Styled Viscount Newark from 1628, he was member of parliament for Nottingham from 1628 until 1629, and was summoned to the House of Lords in his father&#x27;s Barony of Pierrepont in 1641. He succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull in 1643.

During the earlier part of the English Civil War he was at Oxford in attendance upon the King, whom he represented at the negotiations at Uxbridge. In 1645 he was made a Privy Counsellor and created Marquess of Dorchester; but in 1647 he compounded for his estates by paying a large fine to the parliamentarians. Afterwards, Lord Dorchester, who was always fond of books, spent his time mainly in London engaged in the study of medicine and law, his devotion to the former science bringing upon him a certain amount of ridicule and abuse. His collection of books is now part of the library of the Royal College of Physicians.

In 1658 he was made a Fellow of the College of Physicians. After the Restoration he was restored to the Privy Council, and was made Recorder of Nottingham and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Personality==

He was notorious for his bad temper and violent outbursts. He challenged his son-in-law, the future Duke of Rutland, to a duel in 1660; Dorchester blamed Rutland for the fact that his marriage to Dorchester&#x27;s daughter Anne was notoriously unhappy. In 1638 he had to sue for a royal pardon for an assault on one Philip Kinder committed within the precincts of Westminster Abbey, during a religious service. In 1666, on a trivial pretext, he and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, came to blows in the Painted Chamber at Westminster during a Parliamentary conference. They were both imprisoned in the Tower of London for violating the dignity of Parliament as a result, but they were soon released after apologising.

==Marriages and children==

He married first Cecilia Bayning, a daughter of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning, and his wife Anne Glemham, daughter of Sir Henry Glemham. They had four children:
*Lady Anne Pierrepont (born 9 March 1630), married John Manners, future Duke of Rutland. In an unprecedented step, Manners was granted a divorce by an Act of Parliament in 1670.
*Grace Pierrepont.
*Henry Pierrepont (died 1649).
*Robert Pierrepont.

He was secondly married to Lady Catherine Stanley, a daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby and Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby. This marriage was childless.

Dorchester survived his sons and when he died in London on 8 December 1680 the Marquessate of Dorchester became extinct. He was succeeded as 3rd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull by Robert (died 1682), a son of Robert Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, and as 4th Earl by Robert&#x27;s brother William (died 1690).

<text>Bachmann Industries (Bachmann Brothers, Inc.) is a Bermuda-registered, Chinese-owned company, globally headquartered in Hong Kong; specialising in model railroading.

Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the home of its North American headquarters, Bachmann is today part of the Kader group, whose model products are made at a Chinese Government joint-venture plant in Dongguan, China. In the past, Bachmann specialised in entry level train sets. In 1988, the Spectrum line of high-quality, detailed models was introduced to cater to more experienced hobbyists. In the past few years, Bachmann has retooled most of its product line, increasing the quality of its standard line products and discontinuing most of the Spectrum line. Many of the Spectrum products have been slightly modified and are now sold as higher-quality standard line models. Bachmann produces models in HO scale, N scale (1:160 and 1:148), On30, 00 gauge, HOn30 (H0 scale on N tracks) and G scale. They also own the Williams line of tinplate O gauge trains and related products. The turnover for Bachmann model trains for the year ended 31 December 2006 was approximately $146.87 million, a slight increase of 3.36% as compared to 2005.

==History==
Founded in 1833 by Henry Carlisle, the company originally specialized in vanity products such as parasol handles and Spanish combs made of ivory horns. Its target market was aristocracy in the American South and Louisiana. After the Civil War it continued to make other types of hair ornaments and handles for walking canes now out of Tortoise shell and ivory. In 1899 Carlisle&#x27;s firm merged with a competing firm run by Henry G. Bachmann and changed its name to Bachmann Bros. By 1902 Bachmann Bros. started to use celluloid for its products and by 1912 introduced optical frames that were made from it. It was around this time that Bachmann Bros. began experimenting in plastic. In 1927, shortly before they moved to their final Philadelphia address, they became the first American manufacturer of sunglasses. The line, &quot;Solarex&quot; would become very popular worldwide and would later be purchased by the US Army and United States Army Air Forces for their personnel during WWII. During WWII Bachmann Bros. was awarded the coveted Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for outstanding contribution to the war effort by an American company.

Other notable products include Birds of the World Model kits, Plasticville USA, shooting glasses for Winchester Repeating Arms Company (now the U.S. Repeating Arms Company), and Stein Eriksen ski goggles.

==Model railroading products==

Because of the sudden popularity of N scale model railroading around 1966, Bachmann entered the trains market by starting its N scale trains products in June 1968, with cars packaged in white jewel cases. However, problems of initial run led to a retooling the following year. In 1970 Bachmann entered the HO trains market. A second retooling occurred around 1973, when trains started to be packaged in black jewel cases . In 1978 Bachmann changed its logo to the present one. Trains began to be packaged in blue jewel cases. Bachmann Bros. held exclusive licenses to produce models of trains manufactured by Budd Company passenger trains and United Aircraft&#x27;s high-speed train.

Several product lines are produced under the Bachmann name including:

=== Spectrum ===

In 1988 Bachmann introduced the &quot;Spectrum&quot; line of higher quality equipment, including updated motors, more realistic paint schemes, and better detail. Spectrum was considered a totally different company from the regular Bachmann company. The initial offering was a GE 44 Ton Diesel. Later on, the Spectrum line expanded to include a Pennsylvania Railroad K-4 Pacific, an EMD GP30, and a General Electric Dash 8-40C. In 1998, Bachmann introduced their Spectrum H0 scale 2-8-0 Consolidation, which was selected &quot;Model of the Year&quot; by the readers of Model Railroader magazine. By 2000 Spectrum was no longer considered a separate product and became one of the Bachmann product lines, as Spectrum was finally included in Bachmann&#x27;s regular catalogues.

In recent years, Bachmann has begun phasing out the Spectrum brand, moving most of the products in the line to the Standard Line (sometimes with minor changes).

=== Big Haulers and Spectrum large scale models ===
In 1988 Bachmann started to produce large scale (also known as G Scale or garden scale) train sets called the Big Haulers. They were first introduced in sets consisting of a locomotive, one or two freight cars and a caboose, Set 90100 was the first set. The locomotives were battery powered and were radio controlled. In 1989 they began making train sets using track powered electric locomotives. In 1989 Bachmann also began selling locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars as separate items. Since the early years Bachmann introduced a high quality line of prototype 1:20.3 locomotives and rolling stock in their Spectrum Line.

=== Williams ===
In 2007 Bachmann purchased the Williams Electric Trains company, which has allowed the company to expand into the O scale market. Williams offers a more &quot;traditional&quot; train layout reminiscent of the 1950s, with diesel engines, and rolling stock similar in look to the same O gauge products introduced by Lionel Trains during the golden ages of model railroads. Steam engines include semi-scale and scale representations. Williams by Bachmann has produced a new 44 ton switcher that has been introduced in 2015 the company still remains a value leader in the O gauge segment.

=== Today and DCC ===

In an effort to fill the quality gap between the Spectrum brand and the regular Bachmann trains, Bachmann introduced a mid-ranged &quot;Bachmann plus&quot; series in 1992 when production was moved to China. Eventually the entire standard product line would be upgraded to the quality level of the plus series, which led to the drop of the plus series and the birth of the current silver series in 1997. Bachmann doubled the MSRP of its products, and cars are now packaged in clear plastic display jewel cases. In 2001, Bachmann started to produce trains in On30 scale (O scale on HO tracks). In 2002, Bachmann introduced its &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; range in H0 scale. In 2007, a new line of structures was released. In 2010, Bachmann released several Garden Scale models of Thomas &amp; Friends characters, a range which has seen steady releases since. In 2019, it was announced that the Thomas license would also see releases in N scale beginning in 2020.

Since 2006 Bachmann has been concentrating on implementing a Digital Command Control (&quot;DCC&quot;) system and products in its product lines, with the help and partnership of the German company, Lenz Elektronik, GmbH. Bachmann released its Dynamis DCC system in 2007 which enabled Bachmann to catch up technologically with other DCC companies. Currently, Bachmann HO Spectrum lines are DCC on board, while the vast majority of its N Spectrum lines are DCC-ready.

===Plasticville===
Following the war&#x27;s end, Bachmann came up with the product which made their name a household word...&quot;Plasticville USA&quot;...an assemble yourself kit of homes, stores, and other buildings to enhance train layouts. Plasticville USA products are still popular accessories for Lionel and American Flyer trains. Bachmann&#x27;s Plasticville products, originally in O scale, and later expanded to HO scale, and N scale were originally manufactured by Bachmann in Philadelphia, but later manufactured in Hong Kong. They have been made exclusively in China by plastics moulding manufacturer Kader Holdings Company Limited since 1999. The hobby of collecting Plasticville has increased in recent years to the point that the Plasticville Collectors Association was founded in 1999 and incorporated in 2001.

===E-Z Track===
Originally like most other train manufacturers, Bachmann&#x27;s train sets used conventional snap-track (originally in brass, then switching to steel in the early 1980s.) In 1994, Bachmann introduced the then-revolutionary E-Z track, that featured HO track built onto a moulded plastic roadbed that could be assembled like typical HO track. This allowed for operating HO trains on the floor without worry of dust, lint and carpet fibres, though traditional tabletop layouts could also be designed using this track system.

While integrated-roadbed track was not invented by Bachmann (foreign train manufacturers such as Kato Precision Railroad Models and Märklin Trains all had their own types of roadbed track), the E-Z Track was still new and innovative to the North American HO train market. Originally offered only in steel, a nickel-silver version of the track line came out in 1996, and a wide variety of track length and turnout selections became available in the line, including E-Z Command DCC turnouts. After the success of the HO track line, E-Z Track was also made available in N scale as well.

Train sets manufactured by Athearn also come with E-Z Track, as they do not make their own HO track.

==Other products==
During the 1960s Bachmann produced plastic models of animals (Animals of the World series, Birds of the World series, and Dogs of the World series) called Nature Craft Kits. They also produced their own Mini-planes, Slot cars (to compete better with former rival Tyco Toys&#x27;s own HO-scale trains and slot cars) marketed in both HO and a slightly smaller version of 1/32 scale cars and sets, with 1/32 scale track purchased from Strombecker Corporation, whom by the early 1970s closed down its slot car business; military models (with Fujimi) that include fighter planes, helicopters, and Tanks; and toy robots called &quot;Toys of Tomorrow&quot; (with Tomy). Bachmann would drop the toy robots within a couple of years. The Bachmann-Fujimi models would be dropped during the 1970s. Bachmann dropped Slot Cars and Mini-Planes from its product lines after the Kader takeover (see below) but instead entered the Radio-controlled model market. In 1982 they revived their Nature Craft Kits as Birds of the World. By 1987 they have dropped all other toys and only concentrated on Model Trains and Accessories. In 1998 Bachmann did try to sell a short lived product, a radio controlled motorcycle.

Bachmann&#x27;s Mini-planes list included several commercial airline models, such as Boeing 707 in American Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines and fictional Bachmann Airlines marking, Convair CV880 in Delta Air Lines and TWA marking, Boeing 727 in Delta, Eastern Airlines TWA and United Airlines marking, Douglas DC-9 in Delta, Eastern and TWA marking, Douglas DC-8 in United and Japan Airlines marking, Boeing 747 in Japan Airlines, Pan Am and Lufthansa marking, Douglas DC-10 in American marking, Ford Tri-motor in TWA marking, and Douglas DC-3 in American Airlines marking.

==Kader acquisition==
In light of dwindling interest in model railroading, the Crowther brothers decided, in 1981, to sell to their manufacturer, the Kader Group. Kader changed the name to Bachmann Industries and used the new brand to expand worldwide, such as the European market. It is also part of the strategy to take over other failing companies in Europe and put them under one single name. The packaging changed from plastic jewel cases to white paper boxes with cellophane window. Starting from 1982 Bachmann began to slowly retool individual product lines one by one. A typical example would be the replacement of metal gears to cheaper plastic ones in the Diesel locomotives. By 1992 all cars were manufactured in China.

==Global expansion==
As well as introducing its own brands to North America, Kader, under the Bachmann brand, built itself up as the largest volume seller of model railways by purchasing other failing companies, using the Bachmann name to front a series of purchases in the rest of the world to combat the then poor perceptions of Hong Kong-based production quality.

By 1985 Bachmann had established agencies in Corcieux, France, and also in Bologna, Italy.
In 1989 a European division was set up initially reusing the moulds previously used for the Palitoy Mainline model railway products to create the Bachmann Branchline models. It took over Palitoy&#x27;s location and established its European headquarters in Barwell, Leicestershire, England, which continues today as the Bachmann UK headquarters.

In 1991 Bachmann established a sales office in Ontario, Canada, but had it closed down in 1996.

In 1992 it bought Liliput of Austria, and established its Continental Europe headquarters in Fürth, Germany. In 1997 it moved to Altdorf bei Nürnberg, Germany, which continues today as the German Liliput headquarters.

In 2000 it bought Graham Farish.

Bachmann started to work with the Chinese National Railway in 1999, and in 2000 started to produce its first model &quot;East Wind 11 Diesel&quot;. Chinese outline models under the Bachmann China name, opening the world&#x27;s first Bachmann speciality retail shop in Shanghai in 2005. Bachmann China is based in Shanghai.

Kader&#x27;s business model for each take over, from its original purchase of Bachmann to the present day, is to buy a perceived quality brand in the target market or country. The company then closes local in-country production facilities. Armed with state-of-the-art manufacturing machines and AutoCAD systems, Bachmann then improves quality by re-engineering the models in Hong Kong, and reduces cost by producing the models in its jointly owned plant in Dongguan, China.

==International==
Bachmann sells model trains in HO scale, N scale (1:160 and 1:148), On30, 00 gauge, HOn30 (HO scale on N tracks) and G scale around the world, in addition to buildings and accessories:
*North America – Bachmann Industries HO scale, N scale (1:160), On30 and G scale. Plasticville O scale and S scale. Williams (O scale).

<text>Joseph Lloyd Carr (20 May 1912 – 26 February 1994), who called himself &quot;Jim&quot; or &quot;James&quot;, was an English novelist, publisher, teacher and eccentric.

==Biography==

Carr was born in Carlton Miniott in the North Riding of Yorkshire, next to Thirsk railway station, into a Wesleyan Methodist family. His father Joseph, the eldest of 12 children of a tenant farmer, went to work for the railways, eventually becoming a station master then traffic controller for the North Eastern Railway. Carr was given the same Christian name as his father and the middle name Lloyd, after David Lloyd George, the Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer and subsequent Prime Minister. He adopted the names Jim and James in adulthood. His brother Raymond, who was also a station master, and other members of his family called him Lloyd.

Carr attended the village school at Carlton Miniott, where there was an innovative headmaster named James Milner, but when the family moved to Sherburn-in-Elmet when he was about 9 years old, the school in the village was poorly run and he learned little. Carr failed the county examination to gain entry to Tadcaster Grammar School, so at the age of 13 his parents enrolled him at Castleford Secondary School as a fee-paying student. After passing his school certificate examination he stayed on for a year in the sixth form and applied for admission to a teachers&#x27; training college, because the local authority would pay his fees. However, when he was interviewed at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, London, he was asked why he wanted to be a teacher. Carr answered: &quot;Because it leaves so much time for other pursuits.&quot; He was not accepted. Over forty years later, after his novel &quot;The Harpole Report&quot; had become a critical and popular success, he was invited to give a talk at Goldsmiths&#x27;. He replied that the college had had its chance of being addressed by him.

He worked for a school year in 1930–31 as a supernumerary teacher at South Milford Primary School, where he played football for South Milford White Rose, a team which got to the semi-final of the Barkston Ash Cup and won the local league. He developed this experience into his novel &quot;How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup&quot;, taken to an extreme as the title implies. He then successfully applied to Dudley Training College for Teachers and graduated after two years in 1933 with a Certificate in Education. Carr spent his first two years as a teacher at a school in Bitterne, Hampshire before returning to the Midlands to teach in Birmingham. In 1938 he spent a school year as an exchange teacher in Huron, South Dakota, in the Great Plains. Much of the year was a struggle to survive in a strangely different culture; his British salary converted into dollars was pitifully inadequate to meet the American cost of living. This experience gave rise to his novel &quot;The Battle of Pollocks Crossing&quot;.

After his year in the United States, Carr travelled back to England across the Pacific, visiting Japan, China, Malaya (now Malaysia), Burma (now Myanmar), India and Iraq, where he learned that war had been declared, so he hastened back to England, arriving home in September 1939. He volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force in October 1940. After spending a year in a salvage unit in Devon, he was trained as an aerial photography technician at RAF Farnborough and was posted to West Africa, where he served at RAF bases in Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Gambia, experiences that he used in &quot;A Season in Sinji&quot;. He was commissioned as an officer in October 1943 and served as an intelligence officer for squadrons at RAF bases in Kent, Norfolk and Scotland, experiences that he used in his novel &quot;A Day in Summer&quot;. 

In March 1945 he married Sally (Hilda Gladys Sexton), a Red Cross nurse, and after leaving the RAF in about January 1946 and taking three months&#x27; demobilisation leave, he returned to teaching in Birmingham. In 1951 he was appointed headmaster of Highfields Primary School in Kettering, Northamptonshire, a post he filled from 1952 to 1967. He returned to Huron, South Dakota, in 1956 to teach again at the same school for a school year, and wrote and published himself a social history of &quot;The Old Timers&quot; of Beadle County based on the records of the County Historical Society which he had attended in 1938.

In 1967, having written two novels, he retired from teaching to devote himself to publishing and writing. He produced and published from his own house a series of small books designed to fit into a pocket. Some of them were selections from the works of English poets, while others were brief monographs about historical events or works of reference. To encourage children to read each of these small books was given two prices, the lower of which applied only to children. As a result, Carr received several letters from adults using childish writing in an attempt to secure the discount.

He also carried on a campaign with his wife, Sally, to preserve and restore the redundant parish church of St Faith at Newton in the Willows, which had been vandalised and was threatened with demolition. Carr came into conflict with the vicar of the benefice and the higher church authorities in his campaign. The building was saved, but was converted into a scientific study centre. This is now closed.

In 1986 Carr was interviewed by &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine and, as a writer of dictionaries, was asked for a dictionary definition of himself. He answered: &quot;James Lloyd Carr, a back-bedroom publisher of large maps and small books who, in old age, unexpectedly wrote six novels, which, although highly thought of by a small band of literary supporters and by himself, were properly disregarded by the Literary World&quot;.

Carr died of leukaemia in Kettering on 26 February 1994, aged 81.

==Works==

When Carr gave up teaching in 1967 his aim was to try to make his living by publishing small books and a series of maps of English counties to be read and discussed, rather than to provide navigational information. These he published himself under the imprint The Quince Tree Press, The original printing plates from several of his maps were mounted on sheets of plywood and used by Carr as stepping stones in his garden. The garden also contained statues he had carved himself, many of which had mirrors set into the stone at such angles that the sun shone through the windows on his birthday.

Carr wrote eight short novels that contain elements of comedy and fantasy, as well as darker passages, based on his varied experiences of life as teacher, traveller, cricketer, footballer, publisher and restorer of English heritage. Six of the eight were published by different publishers, but he published the last two himself through the Quince Tree Press. Many of the characters and incidents, and even much of the dialogue, are drawn from life.

His novel &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1980, when it won the Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1985 he was shortlisted again for the Booker Prize for &quot;The Battle of Pollocks Crossing&quot;.

Two of his novels have been filmed: &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Day in Summer&quot; (1989).

Carr wrote several non-fiction works and published them at his Quince Tree Press. They include a dictionary of cricketers, a dictionary of parsons, and dictionaries of English kings and queens. He also provided the text for several school textbooks published by Macmillan Publishers and Longman, and designed to develop children&#x27;s English language skills.

<text>Flodafors is a small village in Katrineholm Municipality in Södermanland County, Sweden. Flodafors is often called Floda for convenience. Neighbouring villages include Bie and Valla.
The village is located on the Western Main Line between Katrineholm and Flen. Floda is well known for Floda Church (&quot;Floda kyrka&quot;).

==Floda Church==

Floda church is in Katrineholmsbygden parish in the Diocese of Strängnäs of the Church of Sweden.
The church is built of stone and was originally constructed during the 12th century. 
Some of the paintings in the church date to the 1480s and were made by Albertus Pictor (c. 1440 – c. 1507). Among the church&#x27;s furnishings are an altar cabinet from 1450, the Renaissance-style pulpit from 1662 and the baptismal font which was donated in 1671.
In the 1630s, rebuilding began during which the church was extended and new sacristy was built. The choir was completed in 1666.
In 1885–1888, the church was rebuilt into three-edged neo-Gothic brick basilica under the direction of architect Adolf Kjellström (1834-1932). 
The renovation utilized plans made by architect Axel Herman Hägg (1835-1921).
The church&#x27;s main organ was built for the restoration in 1885 by the organ builder company P.L. Åkerman &amp; Lund (&quot;Åkerman &amp; Lund Orgelbyggeri&quot;) of Stockholm. It was restored during 2006.

==Climate==
SMHI has had a weather station operating in Floda since 1995. It has a borderline humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with sizeable maritime influence, resulting in mild winter averages for its latitude. Floda is still less influenced by the Baltic Sea than areas to its south such as Nyköping and Oxelösund, resulting in harsher winter frosts and larger summer diurnal temperature variation than the coastal parts of the county. Although a reading occurred at the station&#x27;s location measured in a brief existence of a similar station on 20 February 1963, the chart below only records the modern inceptions&#x27; extremes. Due to Flodafors being distinctly influenced by being in the interior, it has some of the warmest average afternoon summer temperatures in all of Scandinavia.

==Recent events==
In 2007, the Social Democrats and the Left Party in Katrineholm Municipality decided to shut down the elementary school in Flodafors.
News of closure pulled off a great public protest, led by people in Flodafors. The Floda independent school association formed and has been operating school activities since the fall of 2009, in the old school premises.

<doc id="691612" wikidata="Q732511" url="?curid=691612" title="Florence Baptistery">
<text>The Florence Baptistery, also known as the Baptistery of Saint John (), is a religious building in Florence, Italy. Dedicated to the patron saint of the city, John the Baptist, it has been a focus of religious, civic, and artistic life since its completion. The octagonal baptistery stands in both the Piazza del Duomo and the Piazza San Giovanni, between Florence Cathedral and the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace.

Florentine infants were originally baptized in large groups on Holy Saturday and Pentecost in a five-basin baptismal font located at the center of the building. Over the course of the 13th century, individual baptisms soon after birth became common, so less apparatus was necessary. Around 1370 a small font was commissioned, which is still in use today. The original font, disused, was dismantled in 1577 by Francesco I de&#x27; Medici to make room for grand-ducal celebrations, an act deplored by Florentines at the time.

The Baptistery serves as a focus for the city’s most important religious celebrations, including the Festival of Saint John held on June 24, still a legal holiday in Florence. In the past the Baptistery housed the insignia of Florence and the towns it conquered and offered a venue to honor individual achievement like victory in festival horse races. Dante Alighieri was baptized there and hoped, in vain, that he would “return as poet and put on, at my baptismal font, the laurel crown.” The city walls begun in 1285 may have been designed so that the baptistery would be at the exact center of Florence, like the temple at the center of the New Jerusalem prophesied by Ezekiel.

The architecture of the Baptistery takes inspiration from the Pantheon, an ancient Roman temple, as observers have noted for at least 700 years, and yet it is also a highly original artistic achievement. The scholar Walter Paatz observed that the total effect of the Baptistery has no parallels at all. This singularity has made the origins of the Baptistery a centuries-long enigma, with hypotheses that it was originally a Roman temple, an early Christian church built by Roman master masons, or (the current scholarly consensus) a work of 11th- or 12th-century “proto-Renaissance” architecture. To Filippo Brunelleschi, it was a near-perfect building that inspired his studies of perspective and his approach to architecture.

The Baptistery is also renowned for the works of art with which it is adorned, including its mosaics and its three sets of bronze doors with relief sculptures. Andrea Pisano led the creation of the south doors, while Lorenzo Ghiberti led the workshops that sculpted the north and east doors. Michelangelo said the east doors were so beautiful that “they might fittingly stand at the gates of Paradise.” The building also contains the first Renaissance funerary monument, by Donatello and Michelozzo.

==History==
===State of knowledge===
Florentines once believed that the Baptistery was originally a Roman temple dedicated to Mars, or a remnant of the city’s rebirth after the Ostrogoths’ ravages. In the modern period skepticism mounted until these legends were abandoned in the nineteenth century, in part because excavations revealed that a very different structure, a large house, was present at the site in Roman times. A burial ground with rough-hewn stones from around the 7th century has also been discovered beneath a portion of the building.

No documents pertaining to the construction of the Baptistery have survived, and passing references to a church of Saint John the Baptist cannot establish its existence because the former Cathedral, now known only as Santa Reparata, was once also referred to as the church of Saint John the Baptist.

The overwhelming scholarly consensus today, based on its construction technique and architectural style, is that the origins of the Baptistery are to be found in the 11th or 12th century. Developing a more precise dating has been difficult because of two confounding indications in Ferdinando Leopoldo Del Migliore’s &quot;Firenze città nobilissima&quot; (1684). According to one, Pope Nicholas II consecrated the Baptistery in 1059; according to the other, a baptismal font was brought into the Baptistery in 1128. Scholars have struggled to make sense of two apparent markers of completion almost 70 years apart, many supposing one must be mistaken in whole or in part.

In the 2020s archival research among the manuscripts of Del Migliore and a close associate revealed that neither claim is accurate: the Baptistery was not consecrated in 1059, and no baptismal font was introduced in 1128. This finding is not entirely surprising; historians started to notice errors in &quot;Firenze città nobilissima&quot; soon after it was published, and in the 20th century, a philologist even demonstrated that Del Migliore had falsified the existence of a medieval Florentine named Salvino degli Armati.

Determining a date for the Baptistery, therefore, depends entirely on relating the evidence inherent in the building itself to the broader context. In the 1930s, Walter Horn’s study of Florentine masonry technique (refinement of stone cutting, mortar application, course patterning) showed that the sandstone construction of the lower levels of the Baptistery was close to that of the church of Santi Apostoli and of the later portions of San Pier Scheraggio, documents about both of which support a dating in the 1060s or 1070s. It is not as refined as the later parts of San Miniato al Monte, datable to 1077-1115.

===Historic collaboration hypothesis===
A hypothesis published in 2024 proposes that the Baptistery originated in the early 1070s from a collaboration between Beatrice of Lorraine and her daughter Matilda of Tuscany, the rulers of the March of Tuscany, and one of the popes with whom they were closely aligned, Pope Alexander II (d. 1073) or more likely Pope Gregory VII (on the papal throne 1073–1085). Although small, Florence was an important administrative and religious center, and these powerful figures would have been willing and able to sponsor a building as ambitious and costly as the Baptistery, which would otherwise seem out of reach for the city. Ranieri, the bishop of Florence appointed in 1072 or 1073 whose tomb has a place of honor inside the building, would have overseen the construction. The hypothesis dovetails with the masonry evidence and radiocarbon dating of charcoal excavated nearby that suggests a major building project took place at this time.

An origin in this period would fit well with the historical context. In the 1060s, reformist Vallombrosian monks accused bishop Pietro Mezzabarba of Florence of simony, specifically of having obtained his office through a corrupt offering of money made by his father. Their accusations gained traction among Florentines, to the point that, according to Peter Damian, they no longer accepted the chrism Mezzabarba consecrated for the baptism of their children, and sought baptism elsewhere. This situation seems to have persisted for three years until 1068, when a Vallombrosian brother underwent a trial by fire in front of the Badia a Settimo to prove the righteousness of the monks’ accusations. His survival made the bishop’s position untenable, and Mezzabarba left Florence that summer. A monumental new baptistery would likely have been seen as a way to restore the authority of the Florentine bishop and help ensure that he oversaw the communal baptism of Florentine infants on Holy Saturday, as canon law required.
The references the Baptistery makes to the Pantheon support the hypothesis of the involvement of a pope. In the eleventh century, the Pantheon, converted to a church in 609, was officiated only on the most important holidays, and only for masses celebrated by the pope himself. Moreover, papal interest in the Roman empire was high. Pope Alexander II sponsored the construction of Sant&#x27;Alessandro Maggiore in Lucca, with ancient capitals and imitative medieval counterparts, and very likely a classicizing facade. Pope Gregory VII’s 1073 consecration of Santa Maria in Portico in Rome is commemorated on its Roman &quot;ara&quot;, a pagan altar, inscribed and repurposed for Christian use (now in Santa Galla, Rome). Church poetry compared Pope Gregory to Julius Caesar, and in a letter Gregory himself stated that the reach of the Church now exceeded that of the Roman Empire. The Church at this time also believed in the Donation of Constantine, according to which the pope inherited the temporal authority of the Roman emperor, justifying his equality with or supremacy over the Holy Roman Emperor in Germany. If interest in antiquity had arisen in Florence organically, one would expect more Florentine Romanesque churches to cite ancient buildings. Instead, parts of the Baptistery completed only a generation or two later, such as the interior gallery level, show a typically medieval delight in geometric and figurative ornament, foreign to the severe interior of the Pantheon.

===The architect===
Stylistic similarities suggest that a single architect may have designed the Baptistery, Santi Apostoli, and San Miniato al Monte. The affinity of the plan of San Miniato (portion begun 1077) with that of the demolished church of Santa Maria in Portico (consecrated by Pope Gregory VII in 1073) could indicate the hand of the same architect, strengthening the case that the architect of the Baptistery came from the papal entourage in Rome. The presence on the Baptistery of a motif including a round-arched window flanked by windows with triangular tympani, also seen on the facade of the Basilica of San Salvatore, Spoleto, could possibly indicate that the architect had been to Umbria.

===Octagonal design===

The Baptistery is octagonal in plan, but finds directionality and a place for its altar thanks to the rectilinear &quot;scarsella&quot; on its western side.

The octagon was a common shape for baptisteries since early Christian times. Other early examples are the fourth-century &quot;Battistero Paleocristiano&quot; excavated beneath Milan Cathedral and the fifth-century Lateran Baptistery. The eight-sidedness of these structures was significant. As Timothy Verdon writes, “while man’s earthly life unfolds in units of finite time like the week with its seven days, in Baptism believers pass over into eternal life, beyond measurable time. They enter into the ‘eighth day’.”

Although the plan of the Pantheon is circular, it can be divided into eight slices, and thus lends itself to reuse in an octagonal building.
===Construction and pre-existences===
According to the most recent research, the baptistery may have been in use by the late 1080s, but construction would continue well into the 12th century.

Giovanni Villani records that the lantern atop the dome was completed in 1150. It is the first known example of this element in the history of architecture.

Excavations show that the building originally had a semicircular apse. Giuseppe Richa recorded that the present &quot;scarsella&quot; was begun in 1202, but his stated archival source cannot be verified. The installation of the lantern in 1150 presupposes a broad dome, which likely would not have survived the removal of a semicircular apse from beneath it since &quot;the chancel is indispensable for the stability of the whole dome, which would not remain standing if the chancel were not to exist&quot;. Thus the &quot;scarsella&quot; may actually date shortly before 1150.

Thick walls beneath the floor of the Baptistery form an inner octagon whose size is approximated by the innermost portion of the Baptistery pavement. The purpose of these walls is obscure, but scholars have suggested that they were part of a smaller baptistery that preceded the current one, that they enclosed a full-immersion basin, or that they held up a ring of columns like in the Lateran Baptistery or Santo Sepolcro, Pisa.

Florence undoubtedly had a baptistery before the present one, but whether it existed at the same location, or was placed somewhere else near the cathedral (the Milan baptistery was behind the cathedral), is a matter of ongoing debate and inquiry.

For much of its early history, the Baptistery stood among tombs. Even in the 19th century, the southern portal was flanked by sarcophagi. These reminders of earthly death underscored the message of eternal life offered by baptism.

==Exterior==
===Design and adornment===

The Baptistery has eight sides ornamented with classical architectural elements over marble incrustation marked by two-color geometric patterns. The rectilinear apse &quot;(scarsella)&quot; expands out of the west side. The other sides are each adorned with three blind arches, of equal size on the intercardinal faces, and with an expanded central arch on the faces that include a doorway. Within these arches are windows with monumental surrounds modeled after the aedicules inside the Pantheon. Several different marbles are used, principally white Carrara marble and a green-black serpentinite from Prato. The architecture of this church would serve as an important influence for Renaissance architects including Filippo Brunelleschi and Leone Battista Alberti.

The zebra-stripe corners are not part of the original design, but were added in 1293, as work on the new cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore began. They covered blocks of sandstone, the stone used for the building structure. The porphyry columns on either side of the “Gates of Paradise” were plundered by the Pisans in Majorca and given in gratitude to the Florentines in 1117 for protecting their city against Lucca while the Pisan fleet was conquering the island. As a painted cassone in the Bargello shows, they were originally freestanding in Piazza del Duomo. Badly damaged in a storm in 1424, they were placed in their current location a few years later.

The cassone also shows the medieval decorative scheme, in which a group of statues by Tino di Camaino surmounted each door. The surviving statues are now in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, with a &quot;Charity&quot; in the Museo Bardini possibly sharing the same provenance.

During the Renaissance, new sculptural groups were commissioned: above the east door, a &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; begun by Andrea Sansovino in 1505 (Baptist), continued by Vincenzo Danti in 1568-1569 (Christ), and completed by Innocenzo Spinazzi in 1792 (angel); above the north door, a &quot;Baptist Preaching&quot; by Francesco Rustici (1506-11), strongly influenced by Rustici’s friend Leonardo da Vinci who depicted the subject himself; and above the south door, Vincenzo Danti&#x27;s &quot;Beheading of the Baptist&quot; (1569-70). Today, all three groups are in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. Only the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; has been replaced by a copy, the spaces above the other two doors now being empty.


Above the main two levels of the exterior, and set back from them, is an attic level, likely completed in the 1130s. It contains the “only error” Brunelleschi said he could find in the building: a horizontal entablature that bends to become vertical, contrary to the practices of classical architecture.

Incorporated into the revetment of the &quot;scarsella&quot; is a fragment of a Roman sarcophagus. Showing a grape harvest and a ship presumably loaded with wine, it is thought to have been made for a wine merchant.

===Bronze doors===
The three monumental sets of doors made for the Baptistery, masterpieces of Gothic and Renaissance art, are now preserved in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, opposite a reconstruction of the Cathedral facade as it would have appeared when the last of them was completed. Copies, made between 1990 and 2009, now hang at the Baptistery within the original door frames. Each set of doors presents chronological Biblical scenes in a different way — as separate doors, each reading across, top to bottom; as a single composition across two doors reading bottom to top; and as two great columns reading left to right and top to bottom.
====Andrea Pisano: South doors====
In the 1320s, the powerful guild that had the patronage of the Baptistery, the Arte di Calimala, determined to embellish it with a set of doors for the south portal, through which parents bearing infants for baptism are believed to have entered. By 1329 they settled on a highly ambitious plan inspired by then-still-unrivaled doors for Pisa Cathedral made by Bonanno Pisano 150 years earlier. Andrea Pisano made wax models for bronze reliefs that were executed by Venetian masters, which he then gilded. The year in which they were begun, 1330, appears above the doors, but they took six years to complete. The historian Giovanni Villani was trusted with oversight of the project, as he later recalled proudly.

The doors present twenty scenes retelling the life of the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, in gilded bronze, many clearly inspired by the fifteen scenes from his life depicted on the interior mosaic ceiling or the three scenes painted by Giotto in the recently-completed Peruzzi Chapel. George Robinson calls this a “visual epic.” The left door presents the Baptist’s role as a prophet, the right door his fate as a martyr. In the lowest register are allegorical figures of the four cardinal virtues, fortitude, temperance, justice and prudence. The figures above them represent the three theological virtues — hope, faith, and charity — as well as humility, whose inclusion was perhaps inspired by the Baptist’s choice to live a life of privation in the desert.
The reliefs are characterized by small figures with a monumental presence. Emotion is measured but unmistakable, as in the scene of the Baptist’s anguished disciples putting him to rest. Although the quatrefoil borders may have been imposed by another artist involved in the project, Andrea Pisano generally finds ways to work within them. For example, the architecture and drapery rhythms in the scene of the Baptist’s funeral artfully confront the enclosing shape. For Anita Moskowitz, “Divine events are interpreted in the most human and down-to-earth terms, without ever sacrificing that sense of the exalted nature of the drama that lifts them into the realm of the spiritual.” Kenneth Clark notes that Andrea’s style is “profoundly human” and that whereas “Giotto’s men and women are types; Andrea’s are individuals.”

The frame around the doors, completed over a century later by the workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti’s son Vittorio, show Adam and Eve after the Fall of Man and the infant Cain and Abel fighting, below flowers and fruits symbolic of the original sin that baptism could remove.
====Lorenzo Ghiberti====
Lorenzo Ghiberti completed two sets of doors for the Baptistery. The art historian Antonio Paolucci called the making of the first set “the most important event in the history of Florentine art in the first quarter of the fifteenth century,” and the making of the second, “one of the great moments in the history of art.”
=====North doors=====

In 1401, the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; asked seven Tuscan sculptors to make a relief of the Sacrifice of Isaac, promising that the most successful would receive a major commission: reliefs for a new set of doors on the east side of the Baptistery. The outstanding entries by Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, now in the Museo del Bargello, are usually considered to mark the beginning of the Renaissance in Western art. Ghiberti received the commission, although it is uncertain whether the 34 judges unanimously declared him the winner, as he asserted in his &quot;Commentari&quot;, or whether they were deadlocked between him and Brunelleschi, as a biography of Brunelleschi written 80 years later claimed.

In November 1403, representatives of the &quot;Arte&quot; signed a contract with the 25-year-old Ghiberti, who would lead a workshop that included Donatello, Michelozzo, Paolo Uccello, and Masolino. Their work was largely finished by summer 1416, but Ghiberti would lead the project until the doors’ installation on Easter Sunday of 1424. The 21-year enterprise proved extremely expensive, equivalent to the annual Florentine defense budget and almost as costly as Florence’s purchase of the entire city of Sansepolcro a few years later. Ghiberti’s salary was equivalent to that of a manager of a Medici bank.

Above eight panels representing the Four Evangelists and the Church Fathers Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Augustine, the life of Christ from the New Testament is told in twenty panels reading from bottom to top, following the “upward path of salvation”. The eye goes first to scenes of Christ’s birth, rising to his baptism and his miracles, until reaching the culminating scenes of his crucifixion and resurrection in the highest register. George Robinson writes that “Ghiberti’s Christ is a dignified, resigned, almost aloof Messiah, whose attitude and behavior have consistently an overtone of sadness and separateness.”

In these doors Ghiberti and his workshop seem to move from a devotion to the International Gothic style to an embrace of Renaissance values. On the one hand, they emphasize sinuous lines and work carefully within the medieval quatrefoil format, making few references to antiquity in most of the panels. Nonetheless, Ghiberti is an innovator, seeking to overcome the limitations of the format by implying a new sense of three-dimensionality through foreshortening, swelling drapery, differing levels of relief, and architecture angled away from the viewing plane. And in a few panels assumed to have been made later, like the &quot;Flagellation,&quot; Ghiberti and his team show a strong interest in antique sculpture and architecture. The panels are surrounded by a framework of foliage in the door case and gilded busts of prophets and sibyls, as well as a self-portrait of the middle-aged Ghiberti, at the intersections between the panels.
=====East doors (“Gates of Paradise”)=====
No sooner were the first set of doors complete than the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; requested from the great humanist Leonardo Bruni a program for another set with stories from the Old Testament. Bruni envisioned at least 24 panels in a format similar to the other doors. Ghiberti, now widely recognized for his enormous talent, was awarded the commission at the beginning of 1425, and by 1429, when work began, had won his patrons over to a completely new format, ten panels without quatrefoils, each large enough to accommodate multiple episodes. Every panel would be gilded in its entirety, giving it more unity than in earlier doors where the panel ground was left in bare bronze.

The project would ultimately prove almost as costly as the first set of doors, but even more beautiful — and the first set of doors, originally hung facing the Cathedral, would be moved to the north portal so that these could take their place.

The stories depicted begin with the Creation of Adam and Eve and end with the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Beyond their literal meaning, they may embody the theological ideas of the future bishop of Florence, Antoninus. For example, the centrality of the creation of Eve in the first panel may refer to Antoninus’ idea that the Church was created from humanity in an analogous manner. For George Robinson, on the other hand, the telling of the stories of Jacob and Esau, Joseph, the Battle of Jericho, and David and Goliath has political overtones: “if the Israelites were to survive… they had to be united despite conflict, and were obliged to allow power and authority to find its place in the hands of the young and untested.”

A recent study emphasizes the learned Ghiberti’s attempt to reconcile Biblical and classical history, for example including increasingly elaborate architectural structures, following Vitruvius’ account in &quot;De architectura&quot; of the history of architecture. Dress also evolves from Abraham and Isaac’s plain robes to the ornately detailed clothing of Solomon and Sheba.

Work on the doors lasted from 1429 until 1447 and involved a large workshop that included Ghiberti’s sons Vittorio and Tommaso, Benozzo Gozzoli, Luca della Robbia, Michelozzo, and Donatello. Together they discovered how to meld different styles and to put into practice innovations like linear perspective and Masaccio’s monumental realism. There was likely also some exchange with Leon Battista Alberti, who sought a theoretical framework for pictorial art in these years, ultimately enshrined in his treatise &quot;De pictura&quot;. As Paolucci writes, the workshop that produced these doors was “the meeting point of differing cultural traditions and stylistic experiences, mediated and transfigured by the refined eclecticism of Lorenzo Ghiberti, by his extraordinary capacity for cultivating both the antique and the modern at the same time, for working within the gothic tradition yet also within renaissance trends”.

One of the most impressive panels tells the story of Jacob and Esau, unfolding slowly from background (Rebecca praying about the twins jostling in her womb at the upper right) to the high-relief foreground (just off-center, Esau, cheated out of his birthright by his slightly younger twin, confronts his father Isaac). The scene corresponds to many of the prescriptions that Alberti would offer in his treatise: it is constructed in an architectural setting seen in linear perspective, Corinthian capitals refer to ancient architecture, drapery is rendered to suggest the beauty of the limbs beneath, and the figures’ motions are harmonious within a coordinated space.


The panels are included in a richly decorated gilt framework of foliage and fruit, many statuettes of prophets and 24 busts. Lorenzo Ghiberti once again includes a self-portrait, which to Kenneth Clark suggests that the “serious young man, intently contemplating his visions, has become a wily old bird, accustomed to all the deceptions of the world, and remembering them half-humorously.”

====Copies and unexecuted work====
Several copies of the doors are held throughout the world. One such copy is held at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Another copy, made in the 1940s, is installed in Grace Cathedral, in San Francisco; copies of the doors were also crafted for the Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia; the Harris Museum in Preston, United Kingdom; and in 2017 for the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.

Giorgio Vasari claimed to have seen models Ghiberti made for a third set of doors that he hoped would replace Andrea Pisano’s.

==Interior==

The domed interior space, with columned niches on its imposing ground level and an apse creating directional emphasis, reprises the Pantheon. Monumental columns of the size used could not be produced in the 11th and 12th centuries, so must have been salvaged from ancient buildings, probably civic or religious structures in the Roman forum that stood at the site of the present Piazza della Repubblica. The walls are clad in dark green and white marble with inlaid geometrical patterns. A shorter gallery level with bifore is ornamented with extensive geometric and figurative designs.
Most of the baroque decor of the Baptistery was removed in the early 20th century, but a statue of the Baptist by Giuseppe Piamontini, donated by Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici remains in the niche to the left of the chancel.

===Altars and baptismal font===
The altar is Giuseppe Castellucci’s 1911 reconstruction of the original 12th-century altar dismantled in 1731, using pieces that Antonio Francesco Gori preserved, along with drawings showing their original arrangement. The altar inspired Brunelleschi’s altar for the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo.

From at least the 13th century, however, a silver panel covered the front of the altar. In 1366 the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; melted it down to start a more sumptuous work. Artists from the circle of Orcagna including Leonardo di Ser Giovanni began work on a new silver altar frontal with scenes from the life of John the Baptist, now displayed in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo.

About the same time, sculptors from the same milieu of Orcagna carved the present octagonal baptismal font (inscribed with the year 1370), which stands near the south entrance.

In the mid-15th century, the decision was made to transform the frontal into a mobile altar that could be set up on the ancient font at the center of the Baptistery three times a year, along with liturgical objects and reliquaries. Matteo di Giovanni and Ghiberti’s son Tommaso worked on the central niche of the new altar, for which Michelozzo cast the central figure of John the Baptist. Later Bernardo Cennini and Antonio del Pollaiuolo would add scenes on the left side, while scenes for the right side were commissioned from Antonio di Salvi and Francesco di Giovanni, and from Andrea del Verrocchio. The resulting ensemble, the Silver Altar of San Giovanni, spans more than a century of Florentine art and was long considered the “noblest emblem of the city.”

Atop the Silver Altar, a precious work in silver and enamel, nearly 2 meters tall, was displayed. Commissioned by the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; in 1457 probably to hold a relic of the True Cross, it consists of a crucifix atop a monumental support that includes a representation of Golgotha in Jerusalem and cast figures of a mourning Mary and Saint John Evangelist. The most artistically significant parts of the work, by Antonio del Pollaiuolo, are in the lowest section, and include an architectural structure similar to the lantern of Brunelleschi’s Dome; two harpies supporting adoring angels; and reliefs of the Baptism of Christ, Moses flanked by Faith and Hope, and four Church Fathers.

===Sepulchral monuments===
Just to the right of the &quot;scarsella&quot; chancel is the tomb of Bishop Ranieri (in office 1072/1073–1113), stylistically similar to the tomb of the Countesses Cilla and Gasdia in the Badia a Settimo from c. 1096 and to the lower level of the facade of San Miniato al Monte.

Nearby is the monumental tomb of Antipope John XXIII by Donatello and Michelozzo. A gilt statue, with the face turned to the spectator, reposes on a deathbed, supported by two lions, under a canopy of gilt drapery. He had bequeathed several relics and his great wealth to the Baptistery. Such a monument with a baldachin was a first in the Renaissance.

In the niche to the left of the chancel are two sarcophagi; as on the other side, the one closer to the altar was placed first. In it is entombed Giovanni da Velletri (d. 1230), the bishop of Florence under whom the mosaic ceiling was begun. The other sarcophagus, with a fourth-century relief of a hunting scene and a much-later cover, was brought to the Baptistery in 1928 from the Palazzo Medici Riccardi. The cover connects the sarcophagus to the Medici family and the &quot;Arte della Lana&quot;, and it is believed to hold the remains of Guccio de’ Medici, a Gonfaloniere of Justice in 1299.

===Pavement===
The marble pavement is made up of many independently designed sections, some geometric, others figurative. A zodiac, similar to that on the pavement of San Miniato al Monte dated 1207, was formerly thought to have astronomical significance, but this is now considered unlikely. The pavement was probably executed over the course of the 12th century. According to seventeenth-century sources, adults placed children atop a porphyry disc inset in the southeast section of the pavement just before baptism.

===Works formerly in the Baptistery===
Several important works besides the Silver Altar and Silver Cross discussed above are now in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo.

The now-demolished Romanesque font and the octagonal enclosure around it were revetted in marble, fragments of which survive in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo and the Church of San Francesco in Sarteano. 

Donatello’s &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot;, made around 1455 in Donatello’s old age, was in the Baptistery in 1500, although it may not have been intended for it.

In 1466, the &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; commissioned liturgical vestments for Baptistery canons in a project that would last more than twenty years, yielding two albs, a chasuble, and a cope. For the scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist embedded into them, a workshop of foreign embroiderers employed the technique of &quot;or nué&quot; to mix gold threads with colored threads, creating a gleaming gold ground with a subtle painting-like image above. Antonio del Pollaiuolo designed the 27 surviving episodes (cut out of the deteriorating vestments in 1733), though there must have been at least one more since the crucial scene of the Baptism of Christ is missing. Still, the episodes are extraordinarily comprehensive in illustrating the life of the Baptist and rate among Pollaiuolo’s most important work. Works by other artists including Luca della Robbia closely imitate details of the scenes, showing how influential they (or the preparatory drawings) were.

===Mosaic ceiling===
The Baptistery is crowned by a magnificent mosaic ceiling in an Italo-Byzantine style, generally considered to have been completed between about 1240 and 1300, with numerous interruptions due to an unstable political situation. The work consists of around ten million mosaic tesserae.
The great artist who made the drawings for the six-meter-high Christ Sitting in Judgment (1) and at least parts of the elegant canopy at the center (2) appears to be an anonymous master known for a large Crucifix in the Uffizi (no. 434); an altarpiece dedicated to St. Francis in the Museo Civico, Pistoia; and a small triptych in the Princeton University Art Museum. The second tier of mosaics (3), representing Christ and angels and other celestial figures, seems to reflect his work as well as that of two important artists who fought in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260, Meliore di Jacopo and Coppo di Marcovaldo. Meliore likely also drew cartoons for the Madonna, apostles, and angels to the left of Christ (1) in the years before 1270. They recall an altarpiece he painted in the Pieve of San Leolino. 

Christ presides over an enormous Last Judgment, its tiles put in place during Dante’s childhood. Paradise, at Christ’s right hand, is largely static, with only a few episodes of motion. These include the emergence of several nudes from their tombs, one of whom, at the extreme left, sees the resurrected Christ and seems ready to fall on his knees before him. Other saved souls, represented as children, follow an enormous angel, and another young soul stands before the gate of Paradise on tiptoe. Meliore and Coppo di Marcovaldo, among other artists, were active in designing this section.

Out of sarcophagi below Christ’s left hand, the damned emerge. Devils usher lost souls into Hell, which is full of motion, contortion, and expressions of pain. Coppo di Marcovaldo designed the best parts of this scene, including the revolting figure of Satan whose pose seems to parody Christ in Judgment. Coppo’s workshop, including his son Salerno di Coppo, composed the rest. Miklós Boskovits describes this section:

Hell is envisaged as a desolate landscape of rocky mountains spewing fire. It pullulates with small devils… who transport the damned and inflict on them the most varied tortures, at times culinary in aspect: in the foreground on the right a man, impaled on a spit, is being turned by a devil who with a long stick stokes up the flames below the roasted sinner, while a fellow-demon bastes him with oil. Nearby, another devil seizes a reprobate by the arm, and is about to amputate it with a meat-cleaver he brandishes above his head.… As for the reprobates, the only one whose identity is certain — assured by a caption — is Judas, hanged on a tree to the far right of the scene…”

The Last Judgment occupies the main zone of three of the eight segments of the dome. The other five segments, meant to be viewed facing the Gates of Paradise and scanning from left to right, include four tiers depicting the beginning of the Book of Genesis (4); the life of Joseph (5); the lives of Mary and Christ (6); and the life of Saint John the Baptist, patron saint of the church and the city (7).

The stories in the first of these segments probably date from the period 1270–75. They include reworking and restorations across many centuries, but in general it seems that the upper Old Testament stories were originally the product of the workshop that included Salerno, Coppo di Marcovaldo’s son, while the New Testament registers below reflect a more naturalistic style close to Cimabue, identifiable with the painter of a crucifix at San Miniato al Monte.

Whether Cimabue himself participated has been a subject of debate since the 1920s, with recent scholarship tending to be supportive, including work by Michael Viktor Schwarz and Miklós Boskovits. Boskovits detected his hand in the episodes of the &quot;Fall of Man&quot;, the &quot;Rebuke of the Creator&quot;, the &quot;Expulsion from Paradise&quot;, &quot;Joseph Sold by His Brothers&quot;, the &quot;False Report of Joseph’s Death&quot;, &quot;Joseph Led into Egypt&quot; (possibly), the &quot;Birth and Naming of the Baptist&quot;, and the &quot;Young St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness&quot;, all of which he dated to the mid-1270s. He compares, for example, the figure of Adam in the &quot;Rebuke of the Creator&quot; with the bust of the Christ child in Cimabue’s Maestà now in the Louvre. 

Cimabue possibly collaborated with, but in any case was succeeded by, Corso di Buono, known from signed and dated frescoes in the church of San Lorenzo, Montelupo Fiorentino. Corso and his workshop were responsible for the remainder of the episodes in the northeast and eastern segments. Several scenes in the southeast segment fell down in 1819 and had to be re-created, but others in a better state suggest the hands of Corso and Grifo di Tancredi.

The remainder of the scenes have been attributed to anonymous artists known as the Penultimate Master and the Last Master, although Boskovits identifies another master who completed the last three scenes of St. John’s life. He places their design in the years around 1300 due to the softness of the modeling, the elaborate architectural settings, and details of the clothing.

Below the main vault, interspersed with rectangular openings, are mosaic depictions of saints, popes, bishops, and martyr deacons, and on the outside faces of the gallery-level parapets are busts of patriarchs and prophets, all from the early 14th century. Among the artists involved were Gaddo Gaddi and the Penultimate Master. Also of this period are the mosaics within the galleries, first those from above the south door, and then those above the east door, attributable to Gaddo Gaddi and Lippo di Benivieni.

The &quot;scarsella&quot; mosaics remain particularly difficult to place stylistically and chronologically. Prophets and saints appear on the triumphal arch leading to the chancel, and on the vault within we see four telamons supporting a large wheel encircling prophets and patriarchs, a mystic lamb at its center, with John the Baptist and the Madonna and Child on either side. Boskovits emphasizes the quality of these mosaics:

What severity of expression in the austere and emaciated physiognomy of the &quot;Baptist!&quot; What moving and timorous pathos in the youthful face of &quot;Thaddeus&quot;, framed by the unruly curls of hair! What richness in the juxtaposition of lights and darks in the modelling of the head of &quot;St. Thomas&quot;. What attention to characterising the sharp and intense face of &quot;St. Paul&quot;, shaded with delicate tonal passages, and enlivened with dazzling highlights!
Execution of the various masters’ designs was not without difficulties. One document notes that two mosaicists named Bingo and Pazzo had to be expelled from the worksite for unprofessional conduct, and new skilled mosaicists were to be sought urgently in Venice or elsewhere.

Since 2023, the mosaic ceiling is once again under restoration, with completion expected in 2028.

<text>A tax lien is a lien which is imposed upon a property by law in order to secure the payment of taxes. A tax lien may be imposed for the purpose of collecting delinquent taxes which are owed on real property or personal property, or it may be imposed as a result of a failure to pay income taxes or it may be imposed as a result of a failure to pay other taxes.

==Federal tax lien in the United States==
In the United States, a federal tax lien may arise in relation to any kind of federal tax, including but not limited to income tax, gift tax, or estate tax.

===Federal tax lien basics===
Internal Revenue Code section 6321 provides:

::Sec. 6321. LIEN FOR TAXES.

:: If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.

Internal Revenue Code section 6322 provides:

:: Sec. 6322. PERIOD OF Tax Lien

:: Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien imposed by section 6321 shall arise at the time the assessment is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.

The term &quot;assessment&quot; refers to the statutory assessment made by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under (that is, the formal recording of the tax in the official books and records at the office of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury). Generally, the &quot;person liable to pay any tax&quot; described in section 6321 must pay the tax within ten days of the written &quot;notice and demand&quot;. If the taxpayer fails to pay the tax within the ten-day period, the tax lien arises automatically (i.e., by operation of law), and is &quot;effective retroactively to (i.e., arises at) the date of the assessment&quot;, even though the ten-day period necessarily expires after the assessment date.

Under the doctrine of &quot;Glass City Bank v. United States&quot;, the tax lien applies not only to property and rights to property owned by the taxpayer at the time of the assessment but also to after-acquired property (i.e., to any property owned by the taxpayer during the life of the lien).

The statute of limitations under which a federal tax lien may become &quot;unenforceable because of lapse of time&quot; is found at . For taxes assessed on or after November 6, 1990, the lien generally becomes unenforceable ten years after the date of assessment. For taxes assessed on or before November 5, 1990, a prior version of section 6502 provides for a limitation period of six years after the date of assessment. Various exceptions may extend the time periods.

===Perfection of federal tax liens against third parties (the Notice of Federal Tax Lien)===
A federal tax lien arising by law as described above is valid against the taxpayer without any further action by the government.

The general rule is that where two or more creditors have competing liens against the same property, the creditor whose lien was perfected at the earlier time takes priority over the creditor whose lien was perfected at a later time (there are exceptions to this rule). Thus, if the government (which is treated as a &quot;creditor&quot; with respect to unpaid taxes) properly files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) before another creditor can perfect its own lien, the tax lien will often take priority over the other lien.

To &quot;perfect&quot; the tax lien (to create a priority right) against persons other than the taxpayer (such as competing creditors), the government generally must file the NFTL in the records of the county or state where the property is located, with the rules varying from state to state. At the time the notice is filed, public notice is deemed to have been given to the third parties (especially the taxpayer&#x27;s other creditors, etc.) that the Internal Revenue Service has a claim against all property owned by the taxpayer as of the assessment date (which is generally prior to the date the NFTL is filed), and to all property acquired by the taxpayer after the assessment date (as noted above, the lien attaches to all of a taxpayer&#x27;s property such as homes, land and vehicles and to all of a taxpayer&#x27;s rights to property such as promissory notes or accounts receivable). Although the federal tax lien is effective against the taxpayer on the assessment date, the &quot;priority&quot; right against third party creditors arises at a later time: the date the NFTL is filed. The form and content of the notice of federal tax lien is governed only by federal law, regardless of any requirements of state or local law.

::The NFTL is merely a device which gives notice to interested parties of the existence of the federal tax lien. Thus, the NFTL&#x27;s function is to perfect and obtain priority for the federal tax lien. The filing or refiling of the NFTL has no effect on the expiration date of collection statute of limitations provided in [Internal Revenue Code] §6502. Accordingly, even if the NFTL is refiled, if no event extends the collection statute of limitations, the IRS cannot take any further administrative collection action. Conversely, the IRS&#x27;s failure to refile the NFTL does not affect the existence of an otherwise valid underlying federal tax lien, i.e., the underlying lien remains valid but loses its priority.

===Subsequent liens taking priority over previously filed federal tax liens===
In certain cases, the lien of another creditor (or the interest of an owner) may take priority over a federal tax lien even if the NFTL was filed before the other creditor&#x27;s lien was perfected (or before the owner&#x27;s interest was acquired). Some examples include the liens of certain purchasers of securities, liens on certain motor vehicles, and the interest held by a retail purchaser of certain personal property.

Federal law also allows a state—if the state legislature so elects by statute—to enjoy a higher priority than the federal tax lien with respect to certain state tax liens on property where the related tax is based on the &quot;value of that property&quot;. For example, the lien based on the annual real estate property tax in Texas takes priority over the federal tax lien, even where an NFTL for the federal lien was recorded prior to the time the Texas tax lien arose, and even though no notice of the Texas tax lien is required to be filed or recorded at all.

===Certificate of release of federal tax lien===
In order to have the record of a lien released a taxpayer must obtain a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien. Generally, the IRS will not issue a certificate of release of lien until the tax has either been paid in full or the IRS no longer has a legal interest in collecting the tax. The IRS has standardized procedures for lien releases, discharges and subordination. In situations that qualify for the removal of a lien, the IRS will generally remove the lien within 30 days and the taxpayer may receive a copy of the Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien. The current form of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien utilized by the IRS contains a provision that provides that the NFTL is released by its own terms at the conclusion of the statute of limitations period described above provided that the NFTL has not been refiled by the date indicated on the form. The effect of this provision is that the NFTL operates as a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien on the day after the date indicated in the form by its own terms.

===The difference between a federal tax lien and an administrative levy===
The creation of a tax lien, and the subsequent issuance of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, should not be confused with the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Levy under , or with the actual act of levy under . The term &quot;levy&quot; in this narrow technical sense denotes an &quot;administrative action&quot; by the Internal Revenue Service (i.e., without going to court) to seize property to satisfy a tax liability. The levy &quot;includes the power of distraint and seizure &quot;by any means&quot;. The general rule is that no court permission is required for the IRS to execute a section 6331 levy.

In other words, the federal tax lien is the government&#x27;s statutory right that encumbers property to secure the ultimate payment of a tax. The notice of levy is an IRS notice that the IRS intends to seize property in the near future. The levy is the actual act of seizure of the property.

In general, a Notice of Intent to Levy must be issued by the IRS at least thirty days prior to the actual levy. Thus, while a Notice of Federal Tax Lien generally is issued &quot;after&quot; the tax lien arises, a Notice of Intent to Levy (sometimes misleadingly called simply a &quot;notice of levy&quot;) generally must be issued &quot;before&quot; the actual levy is made.

Also, while the federal tax lien applies to all property and rights to property of the taxpayer, the power to levy is subject to certain restrictions. That is, certain property covered by the lien may be &quot;exempt&quot; from an administrative levy (property covered by the lien that is exempt from administrative levy may, however, be taken by the IRS if the IRS obtains a court judgment).

A detailed discussion of the administrative levy, and the related Notice, is beyond the scope of this article.

In connection with federal taxes in the United States, the term &quot;levy&quot; also has a separate, more general sense of &quot;imposed.&quot; That is, when a tax law is enacted by the Congress, the tax is said to be &quot;imposed&quot; or &quot;levied.&quot;

===The effect of an offer in compromise on the tax lien===
A properly submitted offer in compromise does not affect a tax lien, which remains effective until the offer is accepted and the offered amount is fully paid. Once the compromised amount is paid, the taxpayer should request removal of the lien.

==County level tax liens in the United States==

In the United States, a tax lien may be placed on a house or any other real property on which property tax is due (such as an empty tract of land, a boat dock, or even a parking place).

Each county has varying rules and regulations regarding what tax is due, and when it is due. The related forms may be tax lien certificates or tax deed certificates.

===Tax lien certificates===
Tax lien certificates are issued immediately upon the failure of the property owner to pay. These forms describe a lien on the property. The liens are generally in first position over every other encumbrance on the property, including liens secured by loans against the property.

Tax lien states are Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The District of Columbia is also a tax lien jurisdiction.

===Tax deeds===
Tax deeds are issued after the owner of the property has failed to pay the taxes. Tax deeds are issued in connection with auctions in which the property is sold outright. The starting bid is often only for the back taxes owed, although the situation may vary from one county to another.

Tax deed states are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

===Tax lien investing===
Tax liens and tax deeds can be purchased by an individual investor.

In the case of tax liens, interest can be earned. If the property is redeemed then the investor would recover invested money, plus interest due after the lien was purchased. If the property is not redeemed, the deed holder or lien holder has first position to own the property after any other taxes or fees are due.

<text>Irrationality is cognition, thinking, talking, or acting without rationality. 

Irrationality often has a negative connotation, as thinking and actions that are less useful or more illogical than other more rational alternatives. The concept of irrationality is especially important in Albert Ellis&#x27;s rational emotive behavior therapy, where it is characterized specifically as the tendency and leaning that humans have to act, emote and think in ways that are inflexible, unrealistic, absolutist and most importantly self-defeating and socially defeating and destructive.

However, irrationality is not always viewed as a negative. Much subject matter in literature can be seen as an expression of human longing for the irrational. The Romantics valued irrationality over what they perceived as the sterile, calculating and emotionless philosophy which they thought to have been brought about by the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. Dada Surrealist art movements embraced irrationality as a means to &quot;reject reason and logic&quot;. André Breton, for example, argued for a rejection of pure logic and reason which are seen as responsible for many contemporary social problems.

<doc id="691642" wikidata="Q2994848" url="?curid=691642" title="Sámi history">
<text>The Sámi people (also Saami) are a Native people of northern Europe inhabiting Sápmi, which today encompasses northern parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The traditional Sámi lifestyle, dominated by hunting, fishing and trading, was preserved until the Late Middle Ages, when the modern structures of the Nordic countries were established.

The Sámi have co-existed with their neighbors for centuries, but for the last two hundred years, especially during the second half of the 20th century, there have been many dramatic changes in Sámi culture, politics, economics and their relations with their neighboring societies. During the late 20th century, conflicts broke out over the use of natural resources, the reaction to which created a reawakening and defense of Sámi culture in recent years. Of the eleven different historically attested Sámi languages (traditionally known as &quot;dialects&quot;), only nine have survived to the present day but with most in danger of disappearing too.

It is possible that the Sámi people&#x27;s existence was documented by such writers as Tacitus. They have on uncertain grounds, but for a very long time, been associated with the &quot;Fenni&quot;. However, the first Nordic sources date from the introductions of runes and include specifically the Account of the Viking Othere to King Alfred of England.

==Prehistory==
The area traditionally inhabited by the Sámi people is known in Northern Sámi as Sápmi, and typically includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia. Previously, the Sámi have probably inhabited areas further south in Fennoscandia. A few Stone Age cultures in the area had been speculated, especially in the 18th and early 19th centuries, to be associated with the ancestors of the Sámi, though this has been dismissed by modern scholars and extensive DNA testing.

===Stone Age===
The commonly held view today is that the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the Fosna culture in southern and central Norway and what used to be called the Komsa culture in the north. The cultural complex derived from the final Palaeolithic Ahrensburg culture of northwestern Europe, spreading first to southern Norway and then very rapidly following the Norwegian coastline when receding glaciation at the end of the last ice age opened up new areas for settlement. The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.

The term &quot;Fosna&quot; is an umbrella term for the oldest settlements along the Norwegian coast, from Hordaland to Nordland. The distinction made with the &quot;Komsa&quot; type of stone-tool culture north of the Arctic Circle was rendered obsolete in the 1970s. &quot;Komsa&quot; itself originally referred to the whole North Norwegian Mesolithic, but the term has since been abandoned by Norwegian archaeologists who now divide the northern Mesolithic into three parts, referred to simply as phases 1, 2, and 3. The oldest Fosna settlements in Eastern Norway are found at Høgnipen in Østfold. A Neolithic individual from Steigen and other Scandinavian individuals revealed admixture from Eastern Hunter-Gatherers and Western Hunter-Gatherers, suggesting migrations from the core regions of both populations into Northern Norway and Scandinavia as a whole. This mixed ancestry prevailed all the way to the Late Neolithic as evidenced by an individual from Tromsø.

== Origin ==

The genetic origin of the Sámi is still unknown, though recent genetic research may be providing some clues.

Lamnidis et al. 2018 discovered the earliest recorded introgression of Nganasan related Siberian ancestry and Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup N1c into northeastern Europe. Saami people&#x27;s Siberian ancestry varies between 20%-25%, while the bronze age individuals from Bolshoy Oleny Island by the Kola peninsula had around 40% of similar ancestry, accompanied with roughly 50% Mesolithic Eastern Hunter-Gatherer ancestry. This admixture event was estimated to have occurred around 2000 BCE by ALDER dating. Sarkissian et al. 2013 reporting on a larger array of individuals from Bolshoy Oleny Island showed the prevalence of the mtDNA haplogroup U5a1 and other subclades of U and C typical to the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of the time, but also atypical D, T and Z.

Archeological evidence suggests that people along the southern shores of Lake Onega and around Lake Ladoga reached the River Utsjoki in Northern Finnish Lapland before 8100 BC. However, it is not likely that Sami languages are so old. According to the comparative linguist Ante Aikio, the Sami proto-language developed in South Finland or in Karelia around 2000–2500 years ago, spreading then to northern Fennoscandia.

The genetic lineage of the Sami is unique, and may reflect an early history of geographic isolation, genetic drift, and genetic bottle-necking. The uniqueness of the Sami gene pool has made it one of the most extensively studied genetic populations in the world. The most frequent Sami MtDNA (female) haplotype is U5b1b1 comprising nearly half of all haplotypes, with type V in around the same quantities, with some minor D, H and Z.

== Before the 15th century ==
Historically, the Sámi inhabited all of Finland and Eastern Karelia for a long time, though the Eastern Sámi became assimilated into the Finnish and Karelian populations after settlers from Häme, Savo, and Karelia migrated into the region. Place names, such as Nuuksio on the south coast of Finland, have been claimed to prove former Sámi settlement. However, the Sámi people increasingly mixed with Finnish and Scandinavian settlers, losing their culture and language. Placename evidence suggesting a former Sámi presence in northwestern Russia (Arkhangelsk Region and the Vologda Region) has also been identified. However, this may alternatively indicate a former population speaking a language related to but distinct from Sami proper.

How far south the area of Sámi population in Norway extended in the past is an uncertain topic, and is currently debated among historians and archeologists. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle the contemporary question of Sámi land rights. He concluded that the Sámi had lived no further south than Lierne Municipality in Nord-Trøndelag county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femunden in the 18th century. This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen&#x27;s view, it is pointed out that no Sámi settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the Sámi culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources. In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a Sámi presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages has increased. These include foundations in Lesja and Vang in Valdres and in Hol and Ål in Hallingdal. Proponents of the Sámi interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and Sámi people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.

Up to around 1500 the Sámi were mainly fishermen and trappers, usually in a combination, leading a nomadic lifestyle decided by the migrations of the reindeer. Around 1500, due to excessive hunting, again provoked by the Sámi needing to pay taxes to Norway, Sweden and Russia, the number of reindeer started to decrease. Most Sámi then settled along the fjords, on the coast and along the inland waterways to pursue a combination of cattle raising, trapping and fishing. A small minority of the Sámi then started to tame the reindeer, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, who, although often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypical Sami lifestyle, only represent around 10% of the Sami people.

It is believed that since the Viking Age, Sámi culture has been driven further and further north, perhaps mostly by assimilation since no findings yet support battles. However, there is some folklore called &quot;stalo&quot; or &#x27;tales&#x27;, about non-trading relations with a cruel warrior people, interpreted by Læstadius to be histories of Vikings interactions. Besides these considerations, there were also foreign trading relations. Animal hides and furs were the most common commodities and exchanged with salt, metal blades and different kinds of coins. (The latter were used as ornaments).

Along the Northern Norwegian coast, the Sámi culture came under pressure during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The nature of the Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the Sámi were quite happy to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from the area around the White Sea.

However, in the early Middle Ages, this is partly reversed, as the power of the chieftains is broken by the centralized Norwegian state. Another wave of Norse settlement along the coast of Finnmark province is triggered by the fish trade in the 14th century. However, these highly specialized fishing communities made little impact on the Sámi lifestyle, and in the late Middle Ages, the two communities could exist alongside each other with little contact except occasional trading.

==Sámi art==

Traditionally, Sámi art has been distinguished by its combination of functional appropriateness and vibrant, decorative beauty. Both qualities grew out of a deep respect for nature, embodied in the Sámi&#x27;s animism. Sámi religion found its most complete expression in Shamanism, evident in their worship of the &quot;seite&quot;, an unusually shaped rock or tree stump that was assumed to be the home of a deity. Pictorial and sculptural art in the Western sense is a 20th-century innovation in Sámi culture used to preserve and develop key aspects of a pantheistic culture, dependent on the rhythms of the seasons.

== An economic shift ==

From the 15th century on, the Sámi came under increased pressure. The surrounding states, Denmark-Norway, Sweden and Russia showed increased interest in the Sámi areas. Sweden, at the time blocked from the North Sea by Dano-Norwegian territory, was interested in a port at the Atlantic coast, and Russian expansion also reached the coasts of the Barents Sea. All claimed the right to tax the Sámi people, and Finnish-speaking tax collectors from the northern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia reached the northern coasts, their Russian colleagues collected taxes as far west as the Harstad area of Norway and the Norwegian tax collectors collected riches from the inland of the Kola peninsula.100 AD: The first written mention of the Sami appears in Tacitus’s work

Hence the hunting intensified, and the number of wild reindeer declined. The Sámi were forced to do something else. Reindeer husbandry started in a limited way. These tamed reindeer were trained to divert wild reindeer over a cliff or into hunting ditches. Reindeer husbandry intensified.

The majority of Sámi settled along the inland rivers, fjords or coast. They started augmenting their diet and income by fishing, either sea or freshwater, hunting other game and keeping cows, sheep and goats.

Reindeer and other animals play a central part in Sami culture, though today reindeer husbandry is of dwindling economic relevance for the Sámi people. There is currently (2004) no clear indication when reindeer-raising started, perhaps about 500 AD, but tax tributes were raised in the 16th century. Since the 16th century, Samis have always paid taxes in monetary currency, and some historians have proposed that large scale husbandry is not older than from this period.

&quot;Lapponia&quot; (1673), written by the rhetorician Johannes Schefferus, is the oldest source of detailed information on Sámi culture. It was written due to &quot;ill-natured&quot; foreign propaganda (in particular from Germany) claiming that Sweden had won victories on the battlefield by means of Sámi magic. In attempts to correct the picture of Sámi culture amongst the Europeans, Magnus de la Gardie started an early &#x27;ethnological&#x27; research project to document Sámi groups, conducted by Schefferus. The book was published in late 1673 and quickly translated to French, German, English, and other languages (though not to Swedish until 1956). However, an adapted and abridged version was quickly published in the Netherlands and Germany, where chapters on their difficult living conditions, topography, and the environment had been replaced by made-up stories of magic, sorcery, drums and heathenry. But there was also criticism against the ethnography, claiming Sámi to be more warlike in character, rather than the image Schefferus presented.

==Swedish advances into Sápmi==

Since the 15th century, the Sámi people have traditionally been subjects of Sweden, Norway, Russia and for some time Denmark. In the 16th century Gustav I of Sweden officially claimed that all Sámi should be under Swedish realm. However, the area was shared between the countries (i.e. only Sweden and Norway—at that time the Baltic-Finnic tribes of the region that is now Finland were also subjects of Sweden) and the border was set up to be the water flux line in Fennoscandia. After this &quot;unification&quot;, the society, a structure with a few ruling and wealthy citizens called birkarls, ceased to exist, especially with the new king Charles IX who swore by his crown to be the &quot;... Lappers j Nordlanden, the Caijaners&quot; king 1607. During the enforced Christianization of the Sámi people, yoiking, drumming and sacrifices were now abandoned and seen as (juridical terms) &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot;, something that was probably aimed at removing opposition against the crown. The hard custody of Sámi peoples resulted in a great loss of Sámi culture.

In the 1630s Swedish authorities imposed a corveé system on Sámi communities near the Nasa silver mine. Mining at the Nasa silver mine proved unprofitable and ended in 1659 it nevertheless caused many Sámi to move to Torne lappmark in the 1640s and 1650s to avoid forced labour. There are reports of Sámi who served in the mining activities becoming extremely impoverished, becoming beggars in consequence.

The boundary agreement between Sweden and Norway (Stromstad Treaty of 1751) had an annex, frequently called Lapp Codicil of 1751, &quot;Lappkodicillen&quot; or &quot;Sami Magna Carta&quot;. It has the same meaning for Sámi even today (or at least till 2005), but is only a convention between Sweden and Norway and does not include Finland and Russia. It regulates how the land is shared by Sámi peoples between the border of Sweden and Norway.

After the 17th century, many Sámi families lost the right to use Swedish land since they were poor and could not pay tribute for it like other subjects. The state also took the Sámi area in tighter control with specific Lappmark Regulations, enforcing non-Sámi settlements on the area. This fostered opposition among Sámi groups that wanted hunting, fishing, and pastoralistic areas back. Instead other groups often took over to put more use to the land. It was also at this time the county of Lappland was established in Sweden.

==Russian interest==
In the 16th century, as part of a general expansion period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the far reaches of the empire, and several Russian Orthodox chapels were built on the Kola Peninsula. The westernmost advance was St. George&#x27;s chapel in Neiden/Njavdam near Kirkenes in the Norwegian/Russian borderlands.

==Dano-Norwegian policies in the North==
On the Norwegian side, the Sámi were converted to the Lutheran faith around 1720. Thomas von Westen was the leading man of the missionary effort, and his methods included the burning of shamanic drums. However, economically the Sámi were not that badly off, compared to the Norwegian population. They were free to trade with whom they wanted, and entertained trade links with Norwegians and Russians alike. However, the crumbling economy of the Norwegian communities along the outer coast led to increased pressure on the land and conflicts between the two communities.

==19th century: Increased pressure==

The 19th century led to increased interest in the far north.

===New borders in an old land===
In 1809, Finland was seized by Russia, creating a new border right through the Sámi area. In 1826, the Norwegian/Russian border treaty finally drew the border between Norway and Finland-Russia, where large tracts of land had previously been more or less governing themselves under very light joint control from Russia, Sweden and Denmark-Norway. This meant that reindeer herders who until now had stayed in Finland in Winter and on the Norwegian coast in Summer, could no longer cross the borders. The Norwegian/Swedish border, however, could still be crossed by reindeer herders until 1940.

The Sámi crossed the borders freely until 1826, when the Norwegian/Finnish/Russian border was closed. Sámi were still free to cross the border between Sweden and Norway according to inherited rights laid down in the Lapp Codicil of 1751 until 1940, when the border was closed due to Germany&#x27;s occupation of Norway. After World War II, they were not allowed to return. Their summer pasturages are today used by Sámi originating in Kautokeino.

For long periods of time, the Sámi lifestyle reigned supreme in the north because of its unique adaptation to the Arctic environment, enabling Sámi culture to resist cultural influences from the South. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sámi cultural element was strengthened, since the Sámi were independent of supplies from Southern Norway.

===Economic marginalization===
In all the Nordic countries, the 19th century was a period of economic growth. In Norway, cities were founded and fish exports increased. The Sámi way of life became increasingly outdated, and the Sámi were marginalized and left out of the general expansion.

===Christianization and the Laestadius Movement===
In the 1840s, the Swedish Sámi minister, Lars Levi Laestadius, preached a particularly strict version of the Lutheran teachings. This led to a religious awakening among the Sámi across every border, often with much animosity towards the authorities and the established church. In 1852, this led to riots in Kautokeino Municipality, where the minister was badly beaten and the local tradesman slain by fanatic &quot;crusaders&quot;. The leaders of the riots were later executed or condemned to long imprisonment. After this initial violent outbreak, the Laestadius movement continued to gain ground in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the leaders now insisted on a more cooperative attitude with the authorities.

===Cultural pressure===
In Norway, use of the Sámi language in teaching and preaching had initially been encouraged. However, with the rise in nationalism in Norway from the 1860s onward, the Norwegian authorities changed their policies in a more nationalistic direction. From around 1900 this was intensified, and no Sámi could be used in public school or in the official church.

== Early 20th century through World War II ==
In the 20th century, Norwegian authorities put the Sámi culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and culture universal. A strong economical development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts; however, strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the Sámi.

The strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sámi culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in Finnmark, had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language. This also ultimately caused the dislocation in the 1920s, that increased the gap between local Sámi groups, something still present today, and sometimes bears the character of an internal Sámi ethnic conflict.

Just as every portion of the European continent, the circumpolar lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union were not spared the wrath of World War II. For the Sámi, who had no concept of national sovereignty, the concept of nations fighting over land was alien. Nevertheless, the Sámi would become entrapped in the conflict from all sides. Another factor was the heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944–45, destroying all existing houses and visible traces of Sámi culture. After World War II, the pressure was relaxed somewhat.

===Prewar hardliners in Norway===
The 20th century started with increased pressure on the Norwegian side of the border. In the name of progress, Norwegian language and culture was promoted, and Sámi language and culture were dismissed as backward, uncultured, downright ridiculous and even the product of an inferior race. Land that previously belonged to no one, and was used according to age-old principles, was considered state property. Settlers had to prove they could speak Norwegian well before they could claim new land for agriculture.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the policies were at first markedly less militant. Teachers followed Sámi reindeer herders to provide education for the children, but Sámi areas were increasingly exploited by the then new mines in Kiruna and Gällivare and the construction of the Luleå-Narvik railway.

Later, with the founding of the Swedish Race Biology Institute, Sámi graves were plundered to provide research material.

===Russia===
In Russia, the age-old ways of life of the Sámi were brutally interrupted by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most Sámi were organized in a single kolkhoz, located in the central part of the Peninsula, at Lovozero (Sámi: &quot;Lojavri&quot;). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the Sámi people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including Nenets and other Arctic peoples.

===Winter War (1939–40) ===
The first fighting Saami became entangled in was between Finland and the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939 when the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the Soviets were denied the ability to construct military bases there. The Red Army, believing that they could easily march across Finland to the Gulf of Bothnia, made the mistake of invading Finland during an unusually cold winter and suffered 27,000 casualties compared to the Finnish mere 2,700. However, as the weather warmed in March 1940, the Finnish line was breached and facing the far larger Soviet forces, was forced to sue for peace on March 12.

=== German invasion and occupation of Norway===
On April 9, 1940, Hitler began Operation Weserübung and invaded Norway. With assistance from former Norwegian Defense Minister and Nazi sympathizer Vidkun Quisling, the Germans were quickly able to gain a foothold. The Nazis viewed ethnic “Nordic Norwegians”, who are Germanic and oftentimes blonde-haired and blue-eyed, as Aryans just like Germans. Quisling shared their view and proposed the complete eradication of the Sámi people, who he viewed as ethnically inferior. Despite the urging of Winston Churchill, British support for the Norwegians was appallingly slow, an action that was responsible for making him prime minister. As a result, the Nazis easily captured the northern port of Narvik. Despite a blockade by the British Royal Navy, the German Wehrmacht were able to hide in the mountains by forcing local Sámi to serve as guides.

On April 20, 1940, King Haakon and the Norwegian government fled to London along with most of the Allied troops stationed there and formed a government in exile. However, Norwegians continued fighting the Nazis through underground resistance. These resistance fighters included many Sámi who had formerly served as part of the Norwegian Ski Brigade and were instrumental in destroying a secret German nuclear base in Telemark in 1944. However, many other Norwegian Sámi were forced into labor by the SS to mine iron ore and build a railway from Narvik to Finland through Finnmark. Forced sterilizations and deportations were also not uncommon.

=== Continuation War ===
At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler offered Finland assistance in recapturing the lost territory to the Soviets (some of which, e.g. Pachenga/Petsamo Finland conquered for the first time in the midst of the Russian Revolution). However, Finland never formally joined the Axis powers, but did closely cooperate with the Germans – including deporting at least some Jews to German camps. The Finns with assistance from the SS Nord invaded Kola on June 1, 1941. Most Finnish Saami served as part of the “Long Distance Patrol” because of their abilities on skis and familiarity with the terrain.

Unfortunately, Finnish Saami, being supplied by forced labor of Norwegian Saami, were forced to fight Russian Saami during the Continuation War. With Finnish assistance, many Saami villages in the Soviet territory were evacuated for the remainder of the war. However, other Saami were not so lucky and along with many other Soviet soldiers and civilians were placed in prison and even concentration camps. This angered the Finnish government, who also refused to assist the Wehrmacht in seizing Leningrad. Eventually the tide turned in favor of the Red Army and Soviet troops marched back into Finland and on June 9, 1944, the Red Army got within striking distance of Helsinki. The Finns sued for peace and lost much territory, including a large part of Saami.

=== Lapland War (1944–45) ===
As a result of Finland&#x27;s peace deal with the Soviets, German troops were required to leave the country. The withdrawal of the German Wehrmacht from Northern Finland and far north of Norway meant that all houses, roads and infrastructure were destroyed. This meant forced evacuation, destruction, an economic setback and the loss of all visible history. The Germans committed many atrocities against the Norwegians and Norwegian Saámi during the Lapland War, including raping hundreds of women, many of whom committed suicide because of the trauma. The Finnmark province, the north-eastern municipalities of Troms province and all of the northern areas of Finland were but smoking ruins. Eventually Soviet troops fully invaded Sampi with the assistance of the Norwegian Army in Exile and liberated Finnmark. On April 26, 1945, Finnmark was liberated.

==Renewed interest==

News in Sámi on national radio in Norway started in 1946. At about the same time, experiments were being done with bilingual teachings of the alphabet in the first and second grade, to ease the learning process. However, the presence of a Sámi minority in Norway was largely ignored. Education, communication, industrialization, all contributed to integrating Sámi communities into Norwegian society at the point of losing identity.

The conflicts between Sámi and the Nordic governments continued into the mid 20th century. The proposed construction of the hydro power dam in the 1960s and 1970s contained controversial propositions such as putting a village (Máze) and a cemetery under water.

Only a minor part is today working with reindeer husbandry. There are also minor groups working as fishermen, producing Sámi arts and serving tourism. Besides having a voting length in the Sámi parliaments (with differing levels of authority and autonomy in various countries) or influence in any Sámi language, the rest are ordinary citizens, adhering to the Scandinavian culture. In Sweden, major parts of Norrland (and not only Sámi villages) are also experiencing major emigration to larger towns.

With the creation of the Republic of Finland in the first half of the 20th century, the Sámi inhabiting this area were no longer under the rule of the Russian Empire, but instead citizens of the newly created state of Finland. The Sámi Parliament of Finland was created in 1973. One recent issue concerning Sámi rights in Finland is the foresting of traditional Sámi land by state-owned Finnish companies.

Since 1992, the Sámi have had their own national day; the February 6.

In 1898 and 1907/08 some Sámi emigrated to Alaska and Newfoundland, respectively, due to requests from the American government. Their mission was to teach reindeer herding to Native Americans.

== Assimilated Sámi ==
Kainuu Sámi was spoken in Kainuu, but became extinct in the 1700s. Kainuu Sámi belonged to the Eastern Sámi language group. It died out when the Kainuu Sámi assimilated and was replaced by Finnish.

The original inhabitants of Kainuu were Sámi hunter-fisherers. In the 17th century, the Governor General of Finland Per Brahe fostered the population growth of Kainuu by giving a ten-year tax exemption to settlers. It was necessary to populate Kainuu with Finnish farmers because the area was threatened from the east by the Russians.

There are only 14,600 Sámi living in Sweden today.

=== Lapland War 1944–1945 in World War II ===
Waffen-SS (6. SS-Gebirgs-Division Nord) were fighting in the Lapland War. There were encounters between the Sámi people and the Germans. The assimilated Sámi would have been fighting in the Finnish army.

<text>The Basilica della Santissima Annunziata (Basilica of the Most Holy Annunciation) is a Renaissance-style, Catholic minor basilica in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. This is considered the mother church of the Servite Order. It is located at the northeastern side of the Piazza Santissima Annunziata near the city center.

==History==
The church was founded in 1250 by the seven original members of the Servite Order. In 1252, a painting of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; had been begun by a friar Bartolomeo, commissioned by the Servite monks. It is said he despaired about being able to paint a virgin with a beautiful enough face, and fell asleep, only to find the painting completed. This miracle he attributed to an angel. The painting now housed in the church, acquired increasing veneration, such that in 1444 the Gonzaga family from Mantua financed a special tribune. Initially Michelozzo, who was the brother of the Servite prior, was commissioned to build it, but since Ludovico III Gonzaga had a special admiration for Leon Battista Alberti, this latter architect was given the commission in 1469. Alberti&#x27;s designs were constricted by the pre-existing foundations. Construction was completed in 1481, after Alberti&#x27;s death. Though the structure was refurbished in Baroque-style in the seventeenth century, the basic scheme of a domed circular space flanked by altar niches is still evident.

The façade of the church was added in 1601 by the architect Giovanni Battista Caccini, imitating the Renaissance-style of Brunelleschi&#x27;s façade of the Foundling Hospital, which defines the eastern side of the piazza. The building across from the Foundling Hospital, designed by Sangallo the Elder, was also given a Brunelleschian façade in the 1520s.

==Veneration==

Pilgrims who came to the church to venerate the miraculous painting often left wax votive offerings, many of them life-size models of the donor (sometimes complete with horses). In 1516, a special atrium was built to house these figures, the Chiostrino dei Voti. By the late 18th century there were some six hundred of these images and they had become one of the city&#x27;s great tourist attractions. In 1786, however, they were all melted down to make candles.

Pope Alexander VI, in appreciation for the survival of Rome after French occupation, paid homage and gifted a silver effigy to the church.

The Florentine brides traditionally visit the shrine to leave their bouquets.

==Interior ==

This church is entered from the &quot;Chiostrino dei Voti&quot;. The Baroque decoration of the church interior was begun in 1644, when Pietro Giambelli frescoed the ceiling with an &quot;Assumption&quot; as a centerpiece based on designs by Baldassare Franceschini.

The 1st chapel to right contains a &quot;Madonna in Glory&quot; by Jacopo da Empoli, with walls frescoed by Matteo Rosselli. The 5th chapel on the right contains a &quot;Monument to Orlando de&#x27; Medici&quot; (1456) by Bernardo Rossellino. The right transept has a small side chapel has a &quot;Pietà&quot; (1559) by Baccio Bandinelli and graces his tomb.

The chapel-surrounded tribune or choir, known as the &quot;Rotonda&quot;, was designed in turn by Michelozzo and Alberti between 1444 and 1476. Notable among the chapels is the fifth (aligned to nave axis), which has a crucifix (1594–8) by Giambologna for his tomb, with statues of the &quot;Active and Contemplative Lives&quot; by his pupil Francavilla, saints and angels by Pietro Tacca, and murals by Bernardino Poccetti. The next chapel has a &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1548–52) by Bronzino with a statue of &quot;St Roch&quot; attributed to Veit Stoss. The next chapel has a &quot;Madonna with Saints&quot; by a follower of Perugino.

In the sixth chapel to the left of the nave is a &quot;SS Ignatius, Erasmus and Blaise&quot; by Raffaellino del Garbo; the next chapel has one of the panels of &quot;Annunziata Altarpiece&quot; (1507) by Perugino, once at the high altar of the church (the &quot;Deposition&quot;, begun by Filippino Lippi, is now at the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia, while other panels are divided between other collections in the world). The altarpiece of the next chapel has a &quot;Trinity with Saint Jerome and two saints&quot; (c. 1455) by Andrea del Castagno, who also painted the mural of &quot;The Vision of St. Julian&quot; in the next chapel, called the &quot;Feroni chapel&quot;. This chapel was elaborately decorated in a baroque fashion by Gianbattista Foggini in 1692. The first chapel just to the left of the entrance has a tabernacle of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; (1448–52) by Michelozzo and the sculptor Pagno di Lapo Portigiani.

The organ built by Domenico Di Lorenzo da Lucca in 1509–1521 is the oldest in Florence and the third oldest in Italy. Today the titular organist of the church is Simone Stella. The church contains the tomb of the Italian writer Maria Valtorta. A memorial was erected in the church to the painter Giovanna Tacconi Messini by her husband after her death.

==Cloisters==

The &quot;Chiostrino dei Voti&quot; was designed by Michelozzo. The center of this small cloister in front of the basilica facade is now sheltered by a glass roof. Baldovinetti painted the first lunette in the chiostro in c. 1460. In about 1476, Rosselli began its decoration with a lunette dedicated to the then blessed Filippo Benizzi, fifth Prior General of the Servites. Further lunettes were added (1509–1510) by Andrea del Sarto.

The large cloister, known as the &quot;Chiostro Grande&quot; or &quot;dei Morti&quot;, flanking the northwest of the church, contains the famous frescoed lunette depictiong the &quot;Madonna del Sacco&quot; (1525) by del Sarto.

The &quot;Capella di San Luca&quot;, which opens off it, has belonged to the artists confraternity or the &quot;Accademia delle Arti del Disegno&quot; since 1565. Many artists are buried in its vault, including Benvenuto Cellini, Pontormo, Franciabigio, Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Lorenzo Bartolini. Inside is Pontormo’s &quot;Holy Family&quot; (c. 1514) painted for church of St. Ruffillo and murals by Alessandro Allori: &quot;Trinity&quot;; Vasari: &quot;St. Luke paints Madonna&quot;; and Santi di Tito: &quot;Solomon directs the construction of the temple of Jerusalem&quot;. The ten large stucco figures were sculpted by Vincenzo Danti, Montorsoli and others.

Most part of the Cloister of SS. Annunziata is today the seat of Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM). In 2007, in the west part of the cloister occupied by the Istituto, the group found a monumental stair by Michelozzo, previously hidden, an &quot;Annunciation&quot; attributed to Paolo Uccello, and some &#x27;Grottesche&#x27; frescoes by Morto da Feltre.

<text>The digital sound revolution (or digital audio revolution) refers to the widespread adoption of digital audio technology in the computer industry beginning in the 1980s.

== Prior methods ==

=== Software-based pulse-width modulation ===
Some of the first computer music was created in 1961 by LaFarr Stuart, who wrote software to modulate the duration of and between pulses (pulse-width modulation or &quot;PWM&quot;, via a process now often referred to as &quot;bit banging&quot;) on a bus line that had been connected to an amplified speaker originally installed to monitor the functioning of Iowa State University&#x27;s CYCLONE computer, a derivative of the Illiac. The entire computer was used to create simple, recognizable tunes using digital audio.

The speakers in the IBM PC (released in 1981) and its successors may be used to create sounds and music using a similar mechanism.

=== Programmable sound generators ===
Programmable sound generators were the first specialized audio circuits in computers included simple analog oscillators that could be set to desired frequencies, generally approximating tones along the musical scale. An example of this is the 1978 POKEY custom ASIC used in the Atari 8-bit computers.

=== FM synthesis ===

The next development was to produce a base frequency, and then modulating it with another frequency to create desired effects; this process of audio waveform synthesis using frequency modulation is usually referred to as FM synthesis. This technology was introduced in the early 1980s by Yamaha, which began manufacturing FM synth boards for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s. This allowed personal computer game audio to have greater complexity than the simplistic beeps from internal speakers. These FM synth boards produced a &quot;warm and pleasant sound&quot; that musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce video game music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community.

Early integrated circuit devices to incorporate FM synthesis methods include the Yamaha OPL2 chip set (YM3812 and external digital-to-analog converter) was included on the AdLib sound card (1987), on the Creative Technology Sound Blaster (1989), and on the Media Vision Pro AudioSpectrum (1991); these were replaced by the next generation Yamaha OPL3 chip set on the Pro AudioSpectrum 16 and Sound Blaster 16.

== Digital-to-analog converters ==
As they became more cost-effective, digital-to-analog converter (often called &quot;D-to-A&quot;—abbreviated &quot;D/A&quot;, or &quot;DAC&quot;) integrated circuits augmented and ultimately replaced FM synthesis devices. These devices enabled computers to play digital audio using an encoding technique known as pulse-code modulation (&quot;PCM&quot;). Unlike pulse-width modulation (&quot;PWM&quot;), which turns a signal on and off, pulse-code modulation also allows the level of a signal to be set to several intermediate levels; in this regard, PWM is similar to black-and-white images, PCM is similar to grayscale images.

Digital audio compact discs (using PCM) were introduced in 1982. Starting in 1985, the medium was adapted for the storage of computer data via the Yellow Book CD-ROM standard and the High Sierra Format (which evolved in ISO 9660).

The Macintosh 128K (1984) and Atari ST (1985) could produce digital audio via software. Without dedicated audio hardware, digital audio on these machines were usually limited to title screens in games (at higher sampling rates) or games which did not feature heavy animation which left enough CPU time to play lower quality samples.

The first computer to with a digital sound processor was the Amiga released in 1985. The MOS Technology 8364 Paula chip has four independent 8-bit DACs and can play either four mono audio channels or two combined stereo channels. It could play digital samples from memory with virtually no CPU usage or any clever software tricks.

In 1989, the Creative Technology Sound Blaster included a processor and digital-to-analog converter, plus the Yamaha OPL2 chip set FM synthesis devices for compatibility with the AdLib sound card. In 1991, Media Vision introduced the original Pro AudioSpectrum, which offered similar functionality but introduced stereo sound, an audio mixer and CD-ROM interface (SCSI and many variants); its 16-bit successor, the Pro AudioSpectrum 16, offered CD-quality sound via its 16-bit compressor-decompressor (&quot;CODEC&quot;).

In 1997, Intel created its Audio CODEC standard AC&#x27;97, which was superseded in 2004 by Intel High Definition Audio (HD Audio).

== Compression ==
High fidelity audio hardware became inexpensive faster than data storage media, driving the development of compression techniques.

A popular early variant of pulse-code modulation (&quot;PCM&quot;) was a compressed version called adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (&quot;ADPCM&quot;).

Sound module files (originally Amiga .MOD files) enabled music to be created and shared via compact files and played back with high quality (using four channels, each at half the sampling rate of audio compact discs). Soon after the release of its Pro AudioSpectrum 16, Media Vision included with it a MOD file player and sample music files.

In the late 1990s, the MP3 format emerged, allowing music to be stored in relatively small files by using high compressions rates through a predictive synthesis technique. Modern computer CD-ROM drives allowed the Red Book CD-DA data to be read in digital format (versus earlier drives that merely output analog audio), which allows entire volumes of music to be copied and encoded many times faster than normal playback speed.

== Non-moving storage ==
After the year 2000, strong demand for small portable music players such as Apple&#x27;s iPods drove competition in component sales, resulting in data storage devices becoming increasingly economical.

== Online music distribution ==
The popularity of high-quality compressed music and the widespread availability of Internet access enabled widespread copyright infringement (most notably through Napster) followed by widespread legitimate sales of music online through the Apple iTunes Music Store, Amazon.com, Walmart.com and others.

== Tapeless recording ==

Until the early 1990s, music was generally recorded and processed by recording studios with the use of analog tape machines, which were essential in recording, editing, mixing and finalizing audio productions. At the beginning of the 1980s, programmable synthesizers and music workstations like the New England Digital Synclavier and the Fairlight CMI appeared, which allowed for parts of a production to be stored digitally within the system&#x27;s mainframe without the need for audio tape. However, a music production in itself which used such synthesizers usually still involved mixing and editing using analog tape machine equipment.

The first computer applications to offer fully digital tapeless recording, mixing and editing were Cubase and Notator for the Atari ST platform around 1989. In the 1990s, these and similar systems began gaining more ground among recording studios, and as computer processing and storing capacity increased, analog tape equipment was gradually replaced by fully computerized recording, in which every step in the production chain is carried out using software and digital storage.

<doc id="691690" wikidata="Q1572601" url="?curid=691690" title="Treaty of Saginaw">
<text>The Treaty of Saginaw, also known as the Treaty with the Chippewa, was made between Gen. Lewis Cass and Chief Mash Kee Yosh, Chief John Okemos, Chief Wasso and other Native American tribes of the Great Lakes region (principally the Ojibwe, but also the Ottawa and Potawatomi) in what is now the United States, on September 24, 1819, proclaimed by the President of the United States on March 25, 1820, and placed in law as .

Native Americans ceded a large tract of land (more than six million acres (24,000 km2) in the central portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The southern boundary of the tract extended from a few miles northeast of Jackson west to just northeast of Kalamazoo. The line then ran directly to the head of the Thunder Bay River in south-central Montmorency County and then along the river to the mouth in Thunder Bay, near Alpena. From there it extended northeast to the international boundary line between the United States and the British Province of Upper Canada and then along the boundary south to the boundary line established by the Treaty of Detroit in 1807, which ran from the shore of Lake Huron in northeast Sanilac County southwest to a point several miles northeast of Lansing and then due south the point of origin. The treaty reserved several smaller tracts of land for Indian use within the ceded territory.

==Background==
The United States had recently signed the Treaty of Greenville and was looking to further expand. Lewis Cass, territorial governor of Michigan, had sought to bring civilization to the territory. While the Detroit area had been previously ceded with the Treaty of Detroit, he had interest in the Saginaw region. He described it as &quot;of first quality&quot; and claimed it would &quot;undoubtedly settle with great rapidity&quot;.

The Michigan territory was at the time sparsely settled. The Anishinaabeg people living in the area were allied with British Canada, being major participants in the North American fur trade. The United States saw this alliance as a threat to national security, and sought to end the fur trade and thus Britain&#x27;s influence in the area.

==Signing of the treaty==
The Saginaw Ojibweg were unwilling to cede their land at first, after the substantial losses from the Treaty of Greenville. Undeterred, Cass and Louis Campau sent two large boats to Saginaw with soldiers and supplies and built a council house for the meeting. Also arriving at Saginaw were some traders, subagents, and interpreters who journeyed across the territory via horse and canoe. They were joined by around 4,000 Anishinaabeg, consisting of Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi peoples.

Cass himself arrived at Saginaw on September 10, 1819, and called for a meeting the next morning at the newly constructed council house. At their first meeting, the governor made statements regarding the necessity of agriculture as civilization encroached and game became scarce. He concluded by stating they would be better off &quot;confining themselves to reservations&quot; and ceding the territory to the American government.

The Anishinaabeg responded with shock and anger. Ogamawkeketo, a representative of the Anishinaabeg, delivered a rousing rebuttal, decrying the Americans for being greedy and invasive compared to the British.

This angered Cass, who informed the council that the United States had reigned victorious in the War of 1812 and thus could easily take over Saginaw without payment. The meeting concluded with a general sense of disappointment and anxiety.

Over the following days, the Americans began to hand out an immense quantity of brandy and whiskey. The intoxicated leadership of the Anishinaabeg fought bitterly against the settlers where they could, with some of the fiercest opposition too drunk to participate in the debates. Eventually Neome, an influential Saginaw Ojibwe leader from the Flint basin, started talks with trader Jacob Smith. After some discussion, Neome agreed to cede some land in exchange for a reservation for his children, believing that resistance would implore the Americans to forcibly annex the land with no compensation. After this, more Anishinaabeg started to enter agreements to reserve their own reservation land, culminating in a scramble to secure land grants.

The land cession was to be carried out in exchange for private reserves for Anishinaabeg people and land grants set aside for mixed-race children of traders and subagents. As a condition, the Saginaw Ojibwe demanded their annuity be paid in full, unlike the delayed payments of the Treaty of Detroit. Fistfights broke out after negotiations over annuity payments floundered. The Americans handled out fifteen barrels of whiskey to quell the situation, leading to the eventual albeit tense resolution of the debate and the signing of the Treaty of Saginaw, ceding most of the land in question to the United States.

The signing of the treaty caused the influence of the Native nations in the old northwest to substantially weaken as the fur trade collapsed, their historic lands were settled, and they became forcibly dependent on annuity payments from the United States.

<text>The NAL Saras () is the first Indian multi-purpose civilian aircraft in the light transport aircraft category as designed by the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL).

In January 2016, it was reported that the project had been cancelled. But in February 2017, the project was revived. In February 2019, India&#x27;s Ministry of Finance approved for the production of the airliner.

==Development==

In the mid-1980s, the Research Council recommended that the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) should study the civil aviation requirements of India and recommended ways of establishing a viable civil aviation industry. It further recommended that NAL should carry out a formal techno-economical feasibility study of a multi role light transport aircraft (LTA – renamed SARAS in October 1993). The feasibility study (November 1989) showed that there was a significant demand for a 9–14 seat multi-role LTA in the country and estimated a market potential of about 250–350 aircraft in the next 10 years. NAL submitted the feasibility study report to the Research Council in November 1990 and started its search for an industrial partner.

The project began in 1991 as a collaboration with Russia (Myasishchev had a similar project called the Duet), but financial trouble led the Russians to drop out early in the project. The project almost came to a halt when it was hit by US-imposed sanctions in 1998, after India&#x27;s nuclear tests in Pokhran. The Saras project was sanctioned on 24 September 1999 with initial schedule of its maiden flight by March 2001. The first Saras (PT1) completed its maiden flight at the HAL airport in Bangalore on 29 May 2004.

The original design target parameters included a maximum take-off weight of 6,100 kg and a maximum payload of 1,232 kg, a high cruise speed of over 600 km/h, an endurance of six hours, a maximum flight altitude of 12 km (cruise altitude 10.5 km), short take-off and landing distances of about 600 m, a maximum rate of climb of 12 m/s, a low cabin noise of 78 dB, a range of 600 km with 19 passengers, 1,200 km with 14 passengers and 2,000 km with eight passengers, a high specific range of 2.5 km/kg and a low cost of operation of ₹ 5/km.

While the designed empty weight of the aircraft is around 4,125 kg, the first prototype weighed in around 5,118 kg. This issue is sought to be addressed by including composite wings and tail by the third prototype. The airframe of Saras-PT2 was built with lighter composites to reduce its overall weight by about 400 kg from its first prototype, which was overweight by about 900 kg. The aircraft is powered by two Canadian Pratt &amp; Whitney turbo-prop engines mounted in the pusher configuration.

The first prototype will be upgraded to meet the latest design criteria including higher-power 1,200 hp (895 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-67A engines and improvements to the flight control and flight operations systems. The upgraded PT1 is due to make its first flight by the end of 2011 leading to certification and first deliveries in 2013 and 2014 respectively.

=== Revised version ===

As of 20 January 2016 National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) had stopped all work on Saras as the funding for the project stopped by end of 2013. Engineers who were working on NAL Saras got redeployed to other ongoing similar projects with higher strategic importance.

The second prototype of the aircraft was overweight by 500 kg against the specified design weight of 4125 kg. The third prototype has yet to take flight. NAL was hoping to revive funding for the project.

In October 2016, it was reported that government is mulling a revival plan. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), that had almost shelved the plan, is on a rethink mode with additional funding in the pipeline.

As of 14 February 2017, the reconfigured first prototype had been handed over to the IAF&#x27;s Aircraft &amp; Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE), which had conducted a few low-speed ground runs. The National Aerospace Lab&#x27;s (NAL) director Jitendra J. Jadhav is said to be looking at putting the Saras back into the air by June–July, though officers on the programme seem to think August–September was a more likely timeframe.

An upgraded Saras undertook high speed taxi trial on 2 January 2018 at Bangalore.

The revised version with 14 seats instead of 19, Saras-PTN1, has improved avionics, radar, linear wing flap actuator, environmental control system, engine flap actuators and flight control system.

The revised prototype first flew on 24 January 2018 from HAL Airport for 40 minutes, reaching and before evaluating system performance over 20 flights to freeze the production design. In a press conference during Aero India 2019, it was revealed that ₹6,000 crores were released for the production of the aircraft as NAL had got the certification for its improved version recently. Weight was no longer an issue as team was successful in cutting down weight by 0.9 tonnes. The new version will also be fitted with better avionics. The second test flight lasted for 25 minutes was completed on 21 February 2018. Additional improvements include a pair of 1200 shaft horsepower engines and 104-inch diameter propeller to cater the requirement of second segment climb gradient. CSIR will collaborate with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in developing an indigenous turboprop engine for Saras. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will manufacture Saras at its Kanpur facility.

=== &quot;Mark 2&quot; ===
In collaboration with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, NAL is also engaged development of &quot;Saras Mk2&quot;, a 19-seater version of the airliner. Government has given clearance and fund requirement to NAL for development of same. NAL has completed basic testing for pre-production standard and aims for certification in 4 years to produce first aircraft in following one-and-a-half-year. Dassault Systèmes announced that NAL will be using 3DEXPERIENCE and DraftSight for cabin design, 2D/3D modelling, prototyping and laser cutting. Mark 2 will undergo wind tunnel testing in November 2019 with tractor configuration. Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) demanded an additional grant of ₹100 crore for 2021–22. NAL is targeting ₹50 crore per unit cost for Saras Mk2 against ₹55 crore for Dornier 228 that has unpressurized cabin with altitude restriction. NAL wants the government to purchase 50-60 units to make manufacturing viable.

On 27 March 2022, NAL unveiled 16-seater air ambulance variant of Saras Mk2 at Wings India 2022. International Critical Care Air Transfer Team (ICATT) from Bengaluru signed letter of intent to purchase 2 units.

On 14 May 2022, NAL started taxi trials of locally developed digital anti-skid braking system on Saras PT1N that will help landing on shorter runways. A total of 15-20 trials are planned to check system performance. It is a state-of-art brake-by-wire electro-hydraulic braking system that is controlled by high-performance flight control computer. Upon validation, the system will be transferred on Saras Mk2. Paras Defence supplied complete glass avionics suite for Saras MK2 in March 2023.

== Orders ==

The IAF has signed up with National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore for the purchase of 15 Saras aircraft and may need 45 more. &quot;NAL signed a memorandum of understanding with IAF to sell 15 Saras aircraft. The Kanpur unit of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd will manufacture these planes&quot;, The aircraft would be used for coastal surveillance as well as training young cadets on transport flying.

₹6,000 crores were initially released in early 2019 for the production of aircraft. Initial order of 15 aircraft by IAF may go up to 120–140 in upcoming years.

==Operators==
Indian Air Force – 60 aircraft (intended)

* Phase 1 – 15 aircraft
* Phase 2 – 45 aircraft

==Incidents and accidents==

On 6 March 2009, 2 Indian Air Force test pilots, Wing Commander Praveen Kotekoppa and Wing Commander Dipesh Shah along with a Flight Test Engineer Squadron Leader Ilayaraja, were killed when the second prototype Saras aircraft operating Flight 49, crashed and caught fire in an open field near Bidadi, about 30 km from Bangalore. A court of inquiry found that wrong engine relight drills given to the pilots contributed to the crash, concluding that an &quot;Incorrect relight procedure devised by the designer and adopted by the crew at insufficient height leading to rapid loss of altitude and abnormal behaviour of aircraft resulted into accident.&quot;

<text>The Inhumans are a superhuman race of super beings appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The comic book series has usually focused more specifically on the adventures of the Inhuman Royal Family, and many people associate the name &quot;Inhumans&quot; with this particular team of superpowered characters.

The Inhumans first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; No. 45 (December 1965), though members Medusa and Gorgon appeared in earlier issues of that series (#36 and No. 44, respectively). Their home, the city of Attilan, was first mentioned years earlier, in a &quot;Tuk the Caveboy&quot; story written and drawn by Jack Kirby that appeared in &quot;Captain America Comics&quot; No. 1 (March 1941). The city was described as the home of a race that was evolutionarily advanced when human beings were still in the Stone Age.

The Inhuman Royal Family has been adapted to numerous Marvel animated series and video games over the years.

Inhuman characters were introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in live action in the second season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, while the Inhuman Royal Family is featured in the television series &quot;Inhumans&quot;, which premiered in 2017; the latter show was critically panned and lasted only one season. Earlier, a proposed film adaptation of the Inhumans was announced in 2014 by Marvel Studios but was later removed from its slate and never came to fruition. The Inhuman race was represented by the appearance of Black Bolt in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022), portrayed by Anson Mount who reprised his role from the television series.

==Development==
In a 1967 interview, Stan Lee discussed the creation of the Inhumans: &quot;The first Inhuman that we brought in was Gorgon... And he was a fella who looked a little like a centaur or something. He could kick his foot very hard and he had great power. He could shatter a mountain by kicking his foot. He started out as a villain. We liked him so much, I should say Jack liked him so much, that he kept using him. We figured he has to come from somewhere. We decided, let him come from some strange land over in Europe, where there are a whole group of people like him. And well, what else could you call them except the Inhumans. Then Jack had to create a whole bunch of Inhumans and I think he did a great job. When it came to doing the leader, we decided, well, there was no need for them all to be villainous. I think we did have in mind that Black Bolt would eventually be a heroic type. And again, we always try to give a character a hangup so his hangup is he doesn&#x27;t speak.&quot;

In a 1969 interview Kirby discussed the costumes of the Inhumans &quot;[with] Black Bolt I began to dress up the lightning insignias. Karnak with the judo-type uniform, it&#x27;s almost Japanese Oriental and half-Egyptian and Medusa with her hair&quot;

==Publication history==
The Inhumans first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; No. 45 (December 1965). The Inhumans appeared as a back-up feature in &quot;Thor&quot; No. 146 (Nov. 1967) to No. 152 (May 1968) which contained their first extensive origin story. They fight the Silver Surfer in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; No. 18 (September 1970). The Inhumans&#x27; first ongoing feature, the first six issues of which were written and pencilled by their co-creator Jack Kirby, appeared in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; No. 1 (Aug. 1970) to No. 10 (Jan. 1972). The characters received their own self-titled series in October 1975, which ran for 12 issues and ended in August 1977. All but issue No. 9 were written by Doug Moench, who has said he was fascinated with the shaggy God story aspect of the Inhumans. A follow-up to the series&#x27;s ending appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; No. 53 (November 1977).

The Inhumans were largely absent from publications for much of the 1980s, but appeared in their own graphic novel in 1988, written by Ann Nocenti and illustrated by Bret Blevins. Nocenti followed up by making the Inhumans Karnak and Gorgon supporting cast members in &quot;Daredevil&quot; from issue No. 272 (November 1989) through No. 283 (August 1990).

An &quot;Inhumans&quot; limited series by Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee ran for 12 issues from November 1998 – October 1999. The series, which used the Inhumans as a social allegory for the U.S., won an Eisner Award for Best New Series and established the Inhumans as viable comics-selling characters. A four-issue limited series by writers Carlos Pacheco and Rafael Marín and artist José Ladrönn was published in 2000. The fourth volume (2003–2004, 12 issues) concentrated largely on new characters within the Inhumans&#x27; society.

In 2007, the Inhumans featured in the &quot;Silent War&quot; limited series by writer David Hine, and artist Frazer Irving.

Following events in the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, the Inhumans appeared on one side of the &quot;War of Kings&quot; storyline, with Black Bolt being made king of the Kree, facing off against Vulcan, who is leading the Shi&#x27;ar.

The 2013 event, &quot;Infinity&quot;, led to major changes in status quo for the group, with many new Inhumans, or &quot;NuHumans&quot;, appearing as a result of the detonation of the Terrigen Bomb. Writer Charles Soule became the lead writer of the Inhuman franchise, starting with the &quot;Inhuman&quot; series, which ran for 14 issues from April 2014–June 2015. The NuHuman Kamala Khan also becomes the lead of her own title, &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; vol. 3. Following the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, the franchise expanded to two ongoing titles, &quot;Uncanny Inhumans&quot;, which ran for 20 issues from 2015 to 2017, and &quot;All-New Inhumans&quot;, which ran for 11 issues. There have been two spin-off titles with &quot;Karnak&quot; running in 2015 for six issues penned by Warren Ellis and drawn by Gerardo Zaffino and Roland Boschi and &quot;Black Bolt&quot; running for 12 issues from 2017 to 2018 penned by Saladin Ahmed and drawn by Christian Ward. In 2017, Marvel announced two series involving the Inhuman royal family, &quot;Royals&quot; written by Al Ewing drawn by Kevin Libranda that was cancelled after 10 issues, and a five issue miniseries titled &quot;Inhumans: Once &amp; Future Kings&quot; written by Christopher Priest and drawn by Phil Noto that explored the royal family&#x27;s origins.

In July 2018, Marvel launched a new five-issue miniseries titled &quot;Death of the Inhumans&quot; written by Donny Cates and drawn by Ariel Olivetti.

==Fictional species biography==
At the beginning of the Kree-Skrull War, millions of years ago in Earth time, the alien Kree established a station on the planet Uranus, a strategic position between the Kree and Skrull empires. Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby Earth had genetic potential invested in it by the alien Celestials. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth&#x27;s then-primitive race &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; to produce the genetically advanced Inhuman race. Their goal was apparently twofold—to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the Skrulls. Although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment because a genetic prophecy had predicted that the experiments would eventually lead to an anomaly who would destroy the Kree Supreme Intelligence.

Born approximately 50,000 BC, Tuk the Caveboy was the first offspring of the Inhumans.

The Inhumans went on to form a society of their own, which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity and developed advanced technology. Experiments with the mutagenic Terrigen Mist (a process known as Terrigenesis) gave them various powers, but caused lasting genetic damage and deformities, which led to a long-term selective breeding program in an attempt to mitigate the effects of these mutations. The Terrigen Mist is a natural mutagen, arising as a vapor from the Terrigen Crystals, which are able to alter Inhuman biology. The Mists were discovered by the Inhuman geneticist Randac approximately 25,000 years ago. He immersed himself in the Mists and gained mental powers comparable to the Eternals. After centuries of eugenics and birth control, the Inhumans managed to mitigate the genetic damage and cultivated a more responsible use of the Terrigen Mists. The practice they developed was to let only genetically perfect specimens undergo the random mutations provoked by the Mists. Their theory was that genetic screening could avoid the risk of hideous and animal mutations in an individual. However, there are examples throughout the Inhumans&#x27; canon where an exposed Inhuman became a devolved, sometimes mindless, evolutionarily inferior throw-back. The term Alpha Primitives was coined for these unfortunate outcasts of Inhuman society, who would for centuries become the breeding stock of a slave race. Resentment at this caste system sometimes bubbles up, and the Alpha Primitives have tried to overthrow their rulers in multiple storylines, often as a result of manipulation by a third party.

Attilan&#x27;s society and culture are predicated on a conformist belief system that permits individuality as it applies to genetic development and physical and mental ability, but demands rigid conformity in that each member of society is assigned a place within that society according to those abilities following exposure to the Terrigen Mist. Once assigned, no Inhuman, no matter how great or powerful, can change his or her place within this rigid caste system. However, as an exception, a member of the Royal Family, Crystal, married outside the Inhuman race to the mutant Quicksilver.

The Inhumans are led by their king, Black Bolt, and his Royal Family, consisting of Medusa, Karnak the Shatterer, Gorgon, Triton, Crystal, Maximus the Mad, and the canine Lockjaw. Both Crystal and Medusa have been members of the Fantastic Four; Crystal has been a member of the Avengers as well.

Black Bolt has guided the Inhumans through some of the most turbulent times in their history, including several attempts by Maximus to usurp the throne, revolts by the worker class (with their eventual emancipation), attacks by human renegades, the kidnapping of Medusa, the destruction and rebuilding of Attilan, and the revelation of the Inhumans&#x27; existence to humanity.

His role as king of the Inhumans has been tumultuous. The first major crisis occurred when he and Medusa conceived a child. Medusa bore the child in defiance of the Genetic Council, who felt that Black Bolt&#x27;s bloodline was too dangerous to pass on. The Council nonetheless took the child to examine and forbade parental contact. Medusa escaped to Earth with members of the royal family only to be harassed by Maximus. Black Bolt was torn between his love of family and his duty to respect the Genetic Council, and it was only when the council was revealed to be using his son in a plot against him that he finally turned against the council. With that, he gave up the crown as king of the Inhumans. For a while, they lived away from Attilan, but returned in times of need.

The once-secret existence of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth&#x27;s superheroes—including the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men—whom they have aided against threats such as Doctor Doom, Ultron 7, Magneto, and Apocalypse. However, no one came to the Inhumans&#x27; aid when an army of Portuguese mercenaries attacked Attilan, which was now located on risen Atlantean ruins. This was actually a coup-d&#x27;etat orchestrated by Black Bolt&#x27;s brother Maximus the Mad.

Inhuman society changed radically when Ronan the Accuser sought to use the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the Shi&#x27;ar control of the Kree after their defeat in the . Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forced the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. He also exiled Maximus and the Alpha Primitives to the Negative Zone. During their time in forced servitude, Ronan revealed that the Inhumans had always been intended as weapons in service to the Kree. To this end, much of the genetic attributes that were encoded in them during the original experiments were meant to give them the abilities and appearances of various alien races, the idea being that these Inhuman slaves could be used to infiltrate alien worlds and races to conduct espionage or assassinations to weaken potential conquests. Ronan used the Inhumans to launch attacks on ships and bases, disrupt a treaty between the Shi&#x27;ar and Spartax, and manipulate Black Bolt to assassinate Empress Lilandra.

Eventually, Black Bolt sought to free his people by challenging Ronan to a personal battle. If Ronan won, the Inhumans would continue to serve him. If the king won, the Inhumans would go free. After a terrible battle, Black Bolt won and Ronan, demonstrating that the Kree still had honor, kept his word and left the Inhumans. All was not over, as the Inhumans were not willing to just follow Black Bolt back to Earth. Pressure had been building in the closed society of Attilan since open contact with the outside world had been made. During their enslavement by Ronan, the Inhumans had wished for their freedom, but had developed a sense of pride in their power and a belief in their own destiny. They no longer believed that Black Bolt or the Royal Family was fit to lead them in the new life they wanted, and they exiled the Royal Family from Attilan. The Royal Family returned to Earth to find their destiny. After suffering bigotry while living in the Baxter Building with the Fantastic Four and turning down political asylum from Latveria by Dr. Doom, the royal family returned to Attilan, which was located on the Blue Area of the Moon. The Inhumans attempted to foster better relations with Earth by sending students to the University of Wisconsin.

===&quot;Son of M&quot;===

In the events of &quot;Son of M&quot;, Quicksilver stole the Terrigen Crystals in an attempt to regain his powers and cure the de-powered mutants from M-Day. The theft led to a conflict on Genosha between the re-powered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good causing their eventual surrender), the Inhumans, and the U.S. Office of National Emergency. The conflict ended with the O.N.E. confiscating the Terrigen Crystals, an act that incited Black Bolt to verbally declare war on the United States.

===&quot;Silent War&quot;===

In January 2007, the miniseries &quot;Silent War&quot; began, with Gorgon launching a first strike on New York. Although the Inhumans do manage to recover the crystals, the episode ends with Maximus again taking control of Attilan. The mini series ends on a cliffhanger, with the destruction of Atilian (foreshadowed in Son of M) and Maximus having taken control over the Inhumans using his psychic power, leaving only Luna and Black Bolt (imprisoned in a cell while Luna feigns support for Maximus for her own safety) free from his control and Maximus vowing that the Inhumans will enslave Earth in retaliation for their destruction of Atilian.

===&quot;New Avengers: Illuminati&quot;===

It has been revealed that Black Bolt has been replaced by a Skrull impostor, in a time frame after &quot;Silent War&quot;, but before &quot;World War Hulk&quot;. The impostor revealed himself to the Illuminati and was killed after a failed attempt to assassinate the heroes.

The series, along with Planet Hulk and World War Hulk, and subsequent mini-series Secret Invasion outright ignore the events of &quot;Silent War&quot; and its status quo

===&quot;Secret Invasion: Inhumans&quot;===

Written by &quot;Heroes&quot; writer Joe Pokaski, this story digs into how the Inhuman Royal Family deals with the news that the Black Bolt had been replaced by a Skrull impostor. The Skrulls attack Attilan while Black Bolt is revealed to be a prisoner of the Skrulls, who intend to use his voice as a weapon of mass destruction. The Inhuman Royal Family defeated several Skrull soldiers and took a Skrull ship with the point of taking the war to the Skrulls and save Black Bolt. With some help from the Kree, they rescue Black Bolt and return to Attilan. The story itself ignores the ending of Silent War, with Medusa being under Maximus&#x27;s mental thrall, Atilan&#x27;s destruction, and Maximus having seized control over the Inhuman population via his mental powers save for Black Bolt and Luna (who are immune to his telepathy).

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===

The Inhuman Royal Family confronts the Unspoken, a cousin of Black Bolt.

===&quot;War of Kings&quot;===

Finally deciding that they will no longer be used and abused by other races, the Inhumans take drastic action to ensure their survival as a race. To that end, they activate a series of long dormant machines beneath the city of Attilan, transforming it into a gigantic starship, powered by Black Bolt&#x27;s voice. Breaking free from its resting place on the Moon, Attilan enters hyperspace and tracks down the remnants of the Skrull Armada, completely eradicating it. As Attilan enters Shi&#x27;ar space, it attracts the attention of three Shi&#x27;ar warships, who order them to depart or they will open fire. They too are destroyed without mercy.

Attilan reaches the planet Hala, destroying the protective shield that guards their weakened empire and enter the planet itself. The Royal Family confronts Ronan the Accuser, who is serving as king. He admitted he felt that he was just holding the spot of ruler for their true king, Black Bolt, but Black Bolt declined the seat of king.

===&quot;Realm of Kings&quot;===

The T-Bomb has killed Black Bolt, leaving leadership to Queen Medusa. The Inhuman Royal Family struggles to maintain their grip on the Kree Empire. The Alpha Primitives revolt, Maximus tries to take the throne, and the Kree aristocracy revolts, which erodes the Inhumans&#x27; rule.

===Universal Inhumans===
Back on Earth, the Fantastic Four encounter an interstellar group of Inhumans formed from the Centaurians, the Dire Wraiths, the Kymellians, and the Badoon. These new Inhumans reveal that the Kree experimented on other interstellar races, aside from humans, and used methods other than the Terrigen Mists. The resulting Universal Inhumans have banded together and traveled to Earth in search of Black Bolt, who they believe will lead their collective people in an eventual takeover of Earth. When Black Bolt returned, the Universal Inhumans arrive on Earth&#x27;s moon where a prophecy revolving around a Midnight King rising from the Inhuman Program and bringing an end to the Kree is revealed. It is this prophecy which was foresaw by the organic super-computer the Supreme Intelligence during the initial stages of the program that lead to its cancellation. The Intelligence ordered Accuser Huran to murder science officer Von-Warr and weaponized biologist Ry-Noor, the scientists responsible for the program, and summon the Accuser Corps to cleanse the experiments on every world that they had seeded. In its haste, however, the Supreme Intelligence failed to download the full data packet from the scientists, and five races of future &quot;Inhumans&quot; escaped the slaughter: the Badoon, the Centaurians, the Dire Wraiths, the Kymellians and early humans. Together they go to Earth to defeat the four Reeds from the Interdimensional Council.

Meanwhile, the resurrected Supreme Intelligence orders the Kree to launch an attack to destroy the Earth and the Inhumans in a bid to prevent the genetic prophecy from occurring unaware that by doing that he actually put the prophecy in motion. They are repelled, with the Inhumans in pursuit.

===&quot;Infinity&quot;===

During the events of &quot;Infinity&quot;, Thanos and his forces attack Attilan and offer to spare the city in exchange for a tribute: the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt surmises that the offering is a ruse to hide the fact that Thanos actually desires the death of Thane, a half-Inhuman youth Thanos had fathered years earlier. Maximus had Eldrac transport the remaining Inhumans to different locations to keep them from being killed by Thanos. The search for Thane eventually reveals that secret Inhuman tribes have existed on Earth for years and mated with its population, producing a number of seemingly-normal humans who possess dormant Inhuman genes. In response to Thanos&#x27; threat, Black Bolt and Maximus evacuate Attilan before destroying it as a show of defiance. The destruction of the city activates the Terrigenisis Bomb, a creation of Maximus, which spreads the Terrigen Mist across the globe and activates special abilities within numerous unsuspecting humans who were Inhuman descendants.

===&quot;Inhumanity&quot;===

During the &quot;Inhumanity&quot; storyline, Karnak was left mentally scarred by said events and begun destroying the upper west side of Manhattan, babbling and sobbing uncontrollably. He was taken into custody by the Avengers. In Stark Tower, Karnak explained to the Avengers what happened during their fight with Thanos and what it meant for the Inhumans. When he was questioning himself for the reason for Black Bolt to spread the Terrigen Mists and what would happen next, Karnak had an epiphany in which he finally saw &quot;the fault in all things&quot;. He told Medusa who was present during his interrogation that she needed to forget everything she thought she knew, ignore the instincts, and forget the past. Otherwise, all would be lost. Following this revelation in which he stated it was too late for him to unlearn a lifetime of error, Karnak shattered the window from his containment cell and jumped out of Stark Tower, killing himself.

It was later revealed that there is another Inhuman city called Orollan which is located somewhere in Greenland. The Inhuman Lash is from Orollan as he plans to recruit the Inhuman descendants to work for him. As the months pass, Medusa also begins gathering the Inhuman descendants (called NuHumans by many), and reveals the existence of the Inhumans to the world. Attilan is rebuilt from its remains on the Hudson River, in a city called New Attilan, serving as an independent nation welcoming all Inhumans and open to any who wish to visit.

Crystal takes a team of Inhumans on the transport vessel called the R.I.V., or Royal Inhumans Vehicle, to follow the Terrigen Cloud and protect any NuHumans. In Australia she finds a skinhead Inhuman with skin-changing powers and a healer named Panacea. Her team visits the hermit kingdom of Sin-Cong to explore why there have been no NuHumans in that country. Her team then investigates mysterious &quot;skypears&quot; that landed around the globe. They investigate a skyspear in China, but are met with suspicion by the Collective Man and the People&#x27;s Defense Force. The skyspear attacks the Inhumans and the People&#x27;s Defense Force, temporarily de-powering the Collective Man. Flint, unaware he is de-powered, nearly kills him with a rock attack, which traumatizes Flint. Crystal decides to leave China and travel to Africa with Ana Kravinoff as their guide to find Flint&#x27;s family in the Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique, Africa in the hidden Inhuman city of Utolan. Upon their return to Attilan, Panacea empathizes with Gorgon&#x27;s suffering and heals his paralysis as practice before she tries her abilities on his comatose son.

===&quot;Civil War II&quot;===

The Terrigen Cloud sweeps over Ohio where it transforms two Ohio State University students named Ulysses Cain and Michelle into Inhumans. While Michelle emerged as a red-skinned beast with wings and a tail, Ulysses emerged unchanged but with the ability of precognition. Iron Man later infiltrated New Attilan to claim Ulysses after fighting off Medusa, Crystal, and Karnak. This leads the Inhumans to head to Stark Tower to reclaim Ulysses which leads to the Avengers, the Ultimates, and S.H.I.E.L.D. to get involved. When Ulysses projects his latest vision that shows a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the superheroes, this causes the younger Inhumans present to cry.

===&quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot;===

The Beast works with Iso to find a way to counter the Terrigen Cloud as Medusa tells the Inhuman Royal Family to be prepared just in case the X-Men take action against them as the Terrigen Cloud becomes saturated. When the shrinking of the Terrigen Cloud threatens to render Earth inhospitable for mutants, Emma Frost, Magneto, and Storm make plans to destroy the Terrigen Cloud. The Beast heads back to Attilan to speak to the Royal Family, only for Emma Frost to go ahead with the attack. The X-Men take out most of the Inhuman Royal Family and trap them in Limbo. After hearing from Iso about why the X-Men want to destroy the Terrigen Cloud, Medusa is the one who destroys the Terrigen Cloud. Medusa abdicates the throne and gives all leadership duties to Iso, knowing that her people will not understand why she destroyed the remaining Terrigen Cloud. Now free of the burdens of being a queen, Medusa happily reunites with Black Bolt in the Quiet Room.

===Encounter with the Progenitors===
Medusa banishes Maximus into an inter-dimensional prison, then with Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon, and Captain Swain are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala to discover the origins of Terrigen and offer a future to their doomed people. During the trip they learn Maximus and Black Bolt had switched bodies, so Black Bolt was actually banished. To further complicate matters, Medusa runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying. It is soon apparent that Medusa&#x27;s decision to destroy the Terrigen Cloud is afflicting her. She did what she had to to save the mutant race, but in doing so she had doomed the future of her people. Because Medusa had pressed the button, that act had the consequence of gradually draining the life energies from her. Akin to dying of a broken heart, Medusa had acted to end a cultural heritage that had lasted millennia and her body has essentially chosen to end with it. Her only hope now is to find the secrets of the Terrigen and bring a new source of it back to their people, so she too can be revitalized.

The Inhumans and Noh-Var discover info on the Primagen which was used by the Progenitors to create the Kree and what the Terrigen derives from. When the Inhumans obtain the Primagen from the Progenitors&#x27; World Farm and Gorgon buys his fellow Inhumans time to get away, Maximus takes a sample of the Primagen and has a vision where the Progenitors attack Earth in retaliation for the theft of the Primagen. While on the Astral Plane with Black Bolt, Medusa and Black Bolt agreed to continue as partners and not lovers. When Medusa takes the Primagen, it restores her hair and health while also causing a backlash in the attacking Progenitor to destroy the approaching Progenitors causing the Ordinator-Class Progenitors that saw the attack from the World Farm to spare Earth from their invasion.

===Establishing New Arctilan===
Following their return from the Progenitors&#x27; World Farm, members of the former Inhuman Royal Family and their allies settled on the Moon, where Marvel Boy created by using Kree technology from his native universe, a pocket atmosphere that surrounds the Leibnitz crater which was dubbed the Gray Area of the Moon. Inside the crater, Flint used both Moon rock and his own body crystal to build New Arctilan the Inhumans&#x27; new base.

===&quot;Death of the Inhumans&quot;===

The Kree have initiated a murdering campaign to force Black Bolt to join the Kree Empire. This ultimatum causes the deaths of thousands of Inhumans with the word &quot;Join or Die&quot; carved into their bodies which forced Black Bolt to call together the four Queens of the Universal Inhuman tribes to respond to this threat. However, the meeting goes far from as planned, as an Inhuman executioner named Vox, a Super-Inhuman created by the Kree, begins his bloody rampage across the place. When Black Bolt and his Royal Family reached the meeting place, they discover the bodies of Oola Udonta, Aladi Ko Eke, Onomi Whitemane and Goddess Ovoe, with the same three words written in their blood on a banner hanging about their corpses and eventually realized that they fell in to a trap as one of the dead Inhumans was wired with an explosive. While most of Black Bolt&#x27;s group made it out alive, thanks to Lockjaw, Triton was not so lucky and was killed in the explosion. Black Bolt then sent Lockjaw to New Arctilan to retrieve his brother Maximus. Unbeknownst to them, Vox and his men had already arrived on New Arctilan and began murdering every Inhuman they come across, old or new. Armed with all of the Inhumans&#x27; abilities and no humanity, Vox easily cuts his prey down with his powers or his energy scythe. Even Maximus cannot defeat Vox, as he quickly loses an arm for even making the attempt. Lockjaw then arrives and teams up with Maximus in an attempt to stop Vox on their own. However, they are unable to defeat Vox as he fires a massive energy blast, destroying them.

When Karnak is sent to the Kree to relay a message from Black Bolt to them, the Kree Commander explains how they dispatched Ronan the Accuser as leader of the Kree after Hala was placed in ruin by Mister Knife and have begun to forge a new life. When asked to kneel, Karnak does not. Instead, he does his best to fend off Vox only for the Super-Inhuman to subdue Karnak. As Black Bolt arrives, he walks through the halls of the Kree base speaking every name of the fallen Inhumans, making it a song about death. Eventually, it comes down to just Black Bolt vs. Vox who is holding Karnak as a shield. Black Bolt signs to Karnak to have Vox take him instead. Vox apparently accepts the change as he teleports himself behind Black Bolt. Before Karnak&#x27;s very eyes, Vox slits Black Bolt&#x27;s throat.

The Kree take Black Bolt prisoner and repair the damage done to his throat without using any sedatives or anesthesia to dull the pain which prompted them to think that Black Bolt&#x27;s great power is gone when he does not scream and therefore the prophecy about the Midnight King is no longer a threat to the Kree. However while being transported, it turns out that he still has his voice, but it is faint. After killing several Kree, Black Bolt secures a firearm and finds Ronan the Accuser alive. However, he is a prisoner of Vox and having been experimented on alongside the Kree soldiers that are loyal to Ronan. Black Bolt learns of this when he sees that Ronan has been converted to a cyborg. At Ronan&#x27;s request, Black Bolt enables him a mercy killing by whispering &quot;You are forgiven.&quot; Elsewhere, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members try to recruit Beta Ray Bill in their fight against Vox and the Kree.

The Inhuman Royal Family are finally taking the battle to the Kree and arrive just in time to save Black Bolt from Vox. Thanks to the interference of Beta Ray Bill, the Inhuman Royal Family are able to overpower and kill Vox, but not before he is apparently able to kill Crystal. They soon realize to their surprise that Vox was actually Maximus in disguise concluding that the Super-Inhuman is not a person. Instead, it is a program and it is also revealed that the voice power that everyone assumes is vaporizing his targets was actually just teleporting them instead as it was seen after Crystal&#x27;s apparent death, she has been transported to an unknown place where Kree scientists are experimenting on the Inhuman victims who were supposedly killed. While Lockjaw is not seen, Triton appears to be in some kind of stasis tank alongside Naja, Sterilon, and other unnamed Inhumans. Crystal is now doomed to be the next Vox.

Meeting up with the Inhuman Royal Family and Beta Ray Bill, Black Bolt is told by Karnak of Vox being a program that transported his &quot;victims&quot; to the Kree. With the Kree planning to turn any captive Inhumans into Vox, Karnak states that not all of them will be rescued. As Black Bolt has one more scream left, Karnak tells him to make it count. Using his sign language, Black Bolt addresses the others on how he has made mistakes in the past and apologizes to them. After holding a moment of silence, Black Bolt orders Gorgon to turn around. The Inhuman ship strikes the Kree&#x27;s base. Vox then pushes a button to unleash the Vox-controlled Inhumans. As Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill engage the Kree soldiers, Black Bolt, Medusa and Karnak arrive at the laboratory where they find Vox-controlled Inhumans like Crystal and Lockjaw. Using a laser, Black Bolt clears the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw just because they were in his way. Entering one door, Black Bolt signs &quot;I love you. I&#x27;m sorry&quot; before whispering for them to run. As Medusa and Karnak fight the Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw, Black Bolt confronts other Vox-controlled Inhumans like Triton. With what little remained of his power, Black Bolt destroyed the engines responsible for transmitting the Vox program, killing all the Inhumans there and robbing the Kree of their plans. Gorgon and Beta Ray Bill arrive stating that the Kree have fled and see Crystal and Lockjaw still alive, having been freed from the Vox-control when the engines were destroyed. Black Bolt emerges from the room as Medusa orders Lockjaw to take them away from the Kree base. When Crystal asks where they should go, Black Bolt uses his sign language to say &quot;Home.&quot; Lockjaw then teleports them away. Beta Ray Bill would later confirm that the Royals were the last of the Inhumans, though there are still a few Inhumans active on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Even without using the Terrigen Mist, the Kree modifications, combined with centuries of selective breeding, have given all Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years. An Inhuman in good physical condition possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength, reaction time, speed, and endurance greater than the finest of human athletes. Karnak and other normal Inhumans who are in excellent physical shape can lift one ton and are physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist can both enhance and in some cases reduce these physical capabilities. Most Inhumans are used to living in a pollution-free, germ-free environment and have difficulty tolerating Earth&#x27;s current level of air and water pollution for any length of time.

==Known Inhumans==
===Alpha Primitives===
The Alpha Primitives are a slave race created by the Inhumans, first appearing in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; No. 47 (February 1966). Because of the Inhumans&#x27; low population, they created a labor force of hominids bred to be strong, but of limited intelligence. They were also rendered unable to breed, being produced only by cloning. They were used by Maximus the Mad in several schemes, resulting in their being freed from servitude by Black Bolt; they would no longer be cloned and those already made would be allowed to live out their lives in a preserve under the city proper. After some time though it was understood that the Alpha Primitives could not live on their own, and the previous arrangement was reversed.

The former king of the Inhumans called the Unspoken revealed that the Alpha Primitives are actually humans who have been exposed to gas created from Xerogen Crystals, a substance created by the Kree as a weapon for the Inhumans to use against their human enemies.

===Bird People===
The Bird-People are a genetic offshoot of the Inhumans with bird wings, and in some cases, bat wings.

===Super-Inhumans===
The Kree eventually designed a new race of Inhumans that differs greatly from the original called Super-Inhumans. They are believed to be engineered from birth with almost of all of their fellows&#x27; Inhuman abilities and none of their problematic humanity. They cannot be swayed or tricked or bought for as they want nothing but their enemies&#x27; hearts to stop beating. The only known member of this new race is Vox and the reason is that the Super-Inhuman race is actually a ruse perpetuated by the Kree and Vox is not actually a person; instead, it is a program designed by the Kree which is then imprinted on selected Inhumans that transforms them genetically into a killing machine. When Vox is defeated or killed, another selected Inhuman would be activated and transformed into Vox.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Richard Fink of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; included the Inhumans in their &quot;Superhero Characters Who Need Their Own Animated TV Shows&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked the Inhuman Royal Family 4th in their &quot;Marvel: 10 Most Powerful Teams&quot; list, 8th in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Superhero Teams&quot; list, and 10th in their &quot;10 Most Fashionable Teams In Marvel Comics&quot; list. Jeremy Brown ranked the Inhumans 8th in their &quot;Marvel: Best Superhero Teams&quot; list.

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Inhumans&quot; (1998) ====
The &quot;Inhumans&quot; comic book series won Best New Series at the 1999 Eisner Awards.

==== &quot;Inhuman&quot; (2014) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Inhuman&quot; No. 1 was the 18th best selling comic book in April 2014. &quot;Inhuman&quot; No. 2 was the 45th best selling comic book in May 2014.

==== &quot;Royals&quot; (2017) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Royals&quot; No. 1 was the 42nd best selling comic book in April 2017. &quot;Royals&quot; No. 2 was the 79th best selling comic book in April 2017.

Brandon Guerrero of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;Royals&quot; No. 1 a score of 85%, writing, &quot;What would happen if the Inhumans&#x27;s Royal Family were to go on an epic journey into space? This is the question that Ewing and Meyers try to answer for us. With their suave artwork and intense narrative, we&#x27;re giving a story that holds up well with the level of power it has to offer.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Royals&quot; No. 1 a grade of 8.4 out of 10, saying, &quot;The Inhumans needed a fresh start every bit as badly as the X-Men. And while the jury is still out as to whether ResurrXion can truly revive the X-Men franchise&#x27;s prospects, it&#x27;s immediately worked wonders for the Inhumans. This issue builds nicely on Ewing&#x27;s work in Inhumans Prime, paving the way for Medusa, Black Bolt and several other big players to leave Earth and venture into space in search of a brighter future for their people. Between The Ultimates and now this series, Ewing clearly thrives when working in a more cosmic-flavored setting. His prose is intelligent and refined, but not in a clinical way that prevents him from really getting to the heart of the Inhuman struggle and Medusa&#x27;s search for redemption. It&#x27;s not entirely clear whether Jonboy Meyers&#x27; exaggerated style is the ideal fit for such a somber book, but there&#x27;s no ignoring the energy he brings to every page or the eye-popping quality of his character designs. At this point, it&#x27;ll be nice just to see Meyers find a more permanent home for a change.&quot;

==== &quot;Inhumans: Judgment Day&quot; (2018) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Inhumans: Judgment Day&quot; #1 was the 120th best selling comic book in January 2018.

Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;Inhumans: Judgment Day&quot; #1 a score of 95%, stating, &quot;For Inhumans fans, this issue is a must-read. It pulls together different characters and plot lines in an effort to start the Inhumans on a new chapter. While parts of the plot feel a little rushed, &quot;Inhumans: Judgment Day&quot; #1 does an amazing job of reenergizing Medusa and giving readers who love the classic Inhumans cast something to look forward to in future series.&quot; Blair Marnell of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Inhumans: Judgment Day&quot; #1 a grade of 7.5 out of 10, asserting, &quot;It&#x27;s going to take a lot to get past the Inhumans&#x27; &quot;we want to be the new X-Men&quot; phase, and the TV series has made them a joke among the general public. That&#x27;s probably not going to change for the foreseeable future. But these characters still have the spark that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby gave them so many years ago, and they can be compelling in the right hands. For this one-shot, Al Ewing recaptures some of that alchemy by reuniting Black Bolt and Medusa while letting the other characters step back from the spotlight. And it really works. Visually, the reemergence of Medusa&#x27;s full power is a stunning moment from Mike Del Mundo, and the rest of his contribution is solid as well. Kevin Libranda&#x27;s segment gives Black Bolt and Medusa&#x27;s reunion a dreamlike quality while delivering some of the much-needed emotional beats between them. This one-shot felt like the end of the last few years&#x27; worth of Inhumans stories. The former royal couple can&#x27;t simply resume their relationship, but &quot;forward&quot; seems a great note to leave them on.&quot;

==== &quot;Death of the Inhumans&quot; (2018) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Death of Inhumans&quot; No. 1 was the 39th best selling comic book in July 2018. &quot;Death of Inhumans&quot; No. 2 was the 69th best selling comic book in August 2018.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===

The Inhuman origin is retold during the prologue of Earth X and the Royal family is reimagined, with Medusa having a much bolder hairline and Blackbolt with his mouth bolted shut.

===Heroes Reborn===

In this alternate reality created by Franklin Richards, the Inhumans are mostly the same. They live on Earth, in Attilan. The biggest difference is the reverence they hold, shown in statues, for Galactus and the multitude of heralds who operate for him simultaneously. The Terrigen Mists are not completely under their control, coming from a crack in the ground. Their ultimate origins are unknown, but Maximus the Mad escapes in the caverns deep beneath the city to locate it. Here, it is discovered their city holds connections to other areas of the world, such as Mole Man&#x27;s Monster Isle.

===House of M===

Black Bolt appears as an ally of Black Panther. The other Inhumans were present at the meeting between Black Bolt, Professor X, and Magneto.

===Squadron Supreme===
In the original Squadron Supreme universe, Power Princess&#x27;s people the Utopians are the equivalent of the Inhumans.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Inhumans made their debut in the Ultimate Marvel Universe in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual&quot; No. 1 (2005). It begins with two mountain climbers reached the walls of their city, Attilan, in the Himalayas when they are turned back with their memories erased. The Inhumans made themselves known to the Fantastic Four when a member of their royalty, Crystal, fled to New York after being ordered to marry Black Bolt&#x27;s brother Maximus. Johnny came across Crystal and attempted to save her from two royal guards from Attilan who were trying to capture her. Beaten, Crystal took him back to the Baxter Building, and revealed herself to the Fantastic Four. She left behind her dog Lockjaw, who had the ability to teleport the Fantastic Four to Attilan. Once their presence was discovered, the city was stripped of its advanced technology and destroyed by Black Bolt, and the Inhumans, including Crystal, relocated. They are hinted to have relocated to the Moon.

The Ultimate Marvel version of Attilan is quite different in appearance from the Marvel Universe version, like a giant wasp&#x27;s nest crossed with a Gothic cathedral. Ultimate Crystal, Lockjaw, and Black Bolt are similar to their counterparts; Medusa is depicted as having actual snakes for hair, like her mythical namesake. Gorgon is female, Karnak projects energy blasts (though he can still sense weaknesses and pressure points), Triton has a more squid-like appearance, and Maximus is a somewhat effete courtier, whom Crystal describes as &quot;preening&quot; and a &quot;peacock&quot;. Other Inhumans shown include Tri-clops, with clairvoyant vision (including the power to see the invisible), Densitor (Maximus&#x27; flunky, who can presumably increase his strength, durability and mass, enough to become fireproof) and an unnamed Inhuman who can produce a swarm of insect-like flying creatures from his body. They claimed that their city had remained secret for 10,000 years, which makes their ancestors contemporaries with Ultimate Marvel&#x27;s Atlantis.

===Amalgam Comics===
The Un-People are a superhero group in the Amalgam Comics universe. They are a combination of DC Comics&#x27; Forever People and Marvel Comics&#x27; Inhumans.

===&quot;Inhumans 2099&quot;===
In the 2004 Marvel Knights &quot;Inhumans 2099&quot; one-shot written by Robert Kirkman, which took place in the future on an alternate world (Earth-2992) that was not identical to the alternate Marvel Universe on Earth-928 featured in the 1990s Marvel 2099 books, the Inhumans leave Earth&#x27;s moon and are forced to live aboard a spaceship after the Mutant Registration Act is passed. After leaving, Black Bolt places himself and his closest confidants (Triton, Gorgon, Karnak, Crystal, and Medusa) in cryogenic stasis and, in his absence, his brother Maximus takes over as leader of the Inhumans living aboard the spacecraft. While in control, Maximus kills Black Bolt&#x27;s confidants in their sleep. Fifty years later, Black Bolt is released from cryogenic stasis to find that Maximus has killed those closest to him. In retaliation, he breaks his vow of silence and destroys the Inhumans&#x27; spacecraft, killing all aboard, including himself.

===Inhumans (Earth-9997)===
In this reality Attilan was returned to the Himalayan mountains at some point until the population grew tired of living in seclusion and decided to leave the Great Refuge to forge new destinies among humanity. This happened at a time when Maximus was once more vying for power and had built a bomb that – once detonated – would release the Terrigen Mists into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The Inhuman Royal Family managed to stop him from doing so with Medusa killing him in the process. With no kingdom to rule over, the Inhuman Royal Family decided to travel to the stars and find their fate elsewhere in the universe. However, Black Bolt felt that his people would be persecuted and demonized by humanity, much like they treat mutants on the outside world, so he decided to unleash the Terrigen Mist bomb filling Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with the gas. This was unknown to all, including the Watcher, whom Black Bolt had blinded to prevent him from seeing. It has been suggested that Black Bolt had some intimate knowledge about the Celestials&#x27; plans for the Earth, and releasing the Terrigen Mists on the Earth was a way to set plans in motion to stop the Celestial birth in Earth&#x27;s core.

Star-Lord successfully cures the Terrigen Plague and frees Black Bolt, allowing the latter to cripple Ronan&#x27;s ship. In &quot;Inhuman Touch&quot;, the Guardians visit the Inhumans on Attilan where Star-Lord has gotten approval of Black Bolt to interrogate Maximus about the location of the Cosmic Seed, until he plans to escape from his cell to control it and destroy any nearby planets.
* The Inhumans appear in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;. 
** Season 3: In the episode &quot;Inhumans Among Us&quot;, an Inhuman ship carrying Seeker and the Alpha Primitives crashes. The Avengers respond to the distress call, where they have a brief fight with Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, and Karnak until Inferno hatches from a Terrigen cocoon nearby, forcing the Avengers and royal family to join forces to fight the newly created Inhuman. Unbeknownst to both parties, Seeker staged the incident as part of a collaboration with Ultron. In &quot;The Inhuman Condition&quot;, Ultron invades Attilan and captures all of its Inhumans except for Black Bolt, Lockjaw, and Seeker. The Avengers come to aid them, whereupon Seeker reveals he has been working on a device to disperse Terrigen Mist throughout Earth and create more Inhumans. However, Ultron created a larger version to exterminate mankind. Once Attilan&#x27;s inhabitants have been rescued, Black Widow throws a Terrigen Crystal into the device, thwarting Ultron&#x27;s plans and creating more Inhumans. In the four-part episode &quot;Civil War&quot;, Ultron disguises himself as politician Truman Marsh and establishes the Inhuman Registration Act to place &quot;registration disks&quot; on Inhumans so he can control them as part of his new plan to destroy mankind. However, the Avengers and Mighty Avengers discover his plot and free the Inhumans.
**Season 5: In the episode &quot;Mists of Attilan&quot;, Black Panther and Ms. Marvel reunite with Black Bolt, Medusa, and Crystal on Atillan about a promise made years ago by T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s grandfather, T&#x27;Chanda to leave them a piece of a key claw, but they are reluctant. Crystal leads Black Panther and Ms. Marvel to the chamber where the key is located, only to discover that she is Princess Zanda of Narobia, a member of the Shadow Council, who was posing as Crystal in order to take the key. They meet up with the real Crystal in a pit and escape to stop Zanda. After this plot and recovering the key, Black Bolt and Medusa accepted Black Panther&#x27;s apologies for the truth.
* The Inhumans feature prominently in the second season of &quot;Marvel Future Avengers&quot;. During the show&#x27;s events, an outbreak of Terrigen Mist on Earth causes several humans to develop newfound powers, with the Avengers and Future Avengers working to determine the cause of the outbreak while attempting to prevent Earth from going to war with the Inhumans.

<text>Aubagne (; according to the classic norm or according to the Mistralian norm) is a commune in the southern French department of Bouches-du-Rhône. In 2020, the commune was awarded three flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition of cities and villages in Bloom.

==Geography==
Aubagne is located in the Huveaune Valley and surrounded by the mountain ranges of Garlaban with Sainte-Baume to the north and east of Marseille. Aubagne was the main city of the former Agglomeration community of Pays d&#x27;Aubagne et de l&#x27;Étoile; it has been part of the Aix-Marseille-Provence Metropolis since 2016. It is the sixth largest city of Bouches-du-Rhône by population.

It is the main producer of Santon figurines and also hosts many cultural events each year. The Foreign Legion has its headquarters in Aubagne. Public transport has been free at the point of use since the year 2000.

Access to the commune is by the A50 autoroute from Marseille which continues south to Toulon. The A501 and A52 autoroutes branch off the A50 in the commune and merge to go north to Aix-en-Provence. Numerous departmental roads go through the commune including: the D96 which goes north to Roquevaire, the D2 which goes east to Gémenos, the D8N which comes from Marseilles and goes south-east to Cuges-les-Pins, the D41E which goes south to Cassis, and many other connecting roads within the commune. There are several smaller towns and villages in the commune apart from the main town: Les Arnauds, Les Grands Mellets, Pinchon, La Martelle, L&#x27;Agrie, La Coueste, La Thuiliere, and Font de Mai. A large proportion of the commune is urban with mountainous terrain to north and south

The main railway from Marseille passes through the commune splitting into two lines - one going north-west and one going south with a station in the town.

The river Huveaune flows through the commune from the east flowing west into the Mediterranean Sea at Prado beach in the 8th Arrondissement in Marseille.

===Climate===
==Transport==
Aubagne was the first commune in France to be completely surrounded by autoroutes: the A50 autoroute Marseille-Toulon, the A52 autoroute to Aubagne-Aix-en-Provence, and the connecting motorway A501.
Regional TER trains operated call at the Gare d&#x27;Aubagne railway station, linking the city with Marseille and Toulon. Local public transport in the city, operated under the &quot;Lignes de l&#x27;agglo&quot; brand, is provided by a network of buses and, since 2014, a single tram line with seven stops between the railway station and Le Charrel. This project has been criticized, as it is not common for a city of its size. Construction started in 2012 and the first phase opened on 1 September 2014, with service provided by eight Alstom Citadis Compact trams. An eastern extension of this line to Les Paluds, as well as a second line to La Penne-sur-Huveaune in the west, has been planned, with a long-term project to link the network to the Marseille tramway.
In 2009, Aubagne made bus travel zero-fare, a scheme which was subsequently extended to the tramway following its opening. This makes the Aubagne tramway the first in the world to be completely free for all users (the Tallinn network, by contrast, is only free for city residents).

==History==

===The Middle Ages===
The death of Queen Joanna I of Naples began a conflict of succession as to who would become the head of the County of Provence. The Union of Aix, a confederation of cities in the region of Provence, supported Charles, Duke of Durazzo, rather than Louis I, Duke of Anjou. By the spring of 1382 the Lord of Aubagne, François des Baux, supported the Duke of Anjou. This support was conditional upon the Duke helping to restore the queen to her throne.

On 4 April 1402 in Brantes, at the foot of Mont Ventoux, and in the presence of his wife &quot;Alix des Baux&quot;, Odon de Villars bestowed upon his nephew Philippe de Lévis the fiefs of Brantes, Plaisians and their dependencies: the Lordships of Saint-Marcel, Roquefort, le Castellet, Cassis, and Port-Miou which were dependencies of the barony of Aubagne, as well as La Fare-les-Oliviers, and Éguilles. In return, Philippe de Lévis would be surety for Viscount Raymond of Turenne for the agreement between Odon de Villars, his wife Alix, and himself. If Odon and Alix failed to respect the terms of the agreement, they would have to pay 50,000 florins to the viscount.

===Heraldry===
==Politics and administration==

===Political life===
Between 1965 and 2014, Aubagne has elected three Communist mayors: the municipal council is composed mainly of communist, socialist, and other left-leaning members. Still, a significant portion of the population supports centre, right-of-centre, or even far-right political positions. In the second round of elections in 1988, both a representative of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste), Jean Tardito, and a representative of the far-right National Front party (Front National), Joëlle Melin, were elected. Edmond Garcin, of the Communist party, was elected mayor from 1965 to 1987.

In 2001, the resignation of Jean Tardito brought Daniel Fontaine (PCF) to the position of mayor. In 2008 there were 4 candidates in the first round of municipal elections: Daniel Fontaine for The United Left and a civil society, Sylvia Barthelemy for the UMP and the New Centre, Jean-Marie Orihuel for the Democratic Movement, and Joëlle Melin for the National Front. In the second round the United Left, the Civil Society, and the Democratic Movement joined together to form the Left Union list which was renamed the &quot;rainbow&quot;. In 2014, the mayorship shifted as Gérard Gazay (UMP) was elected to the position of mayor after an alliance with Sylvia Barthelemy during the second round.

==Environment and related policies==
Agenda 21 sets the terms and conditions for sustainable development in Aubagne which includes providing free public transit, offering a recycling program, encouraging energy conservation and energy demand management, launching awareness campaigns in schools to promote sustainable development and eco-citizenship, and giving incentives for purchasing solar panels. More than 4,000 individual bins and 15,000 recycling bags are available to residents.

The city of Aubagne conducts its environmental, social, and economic policies in collaboration with neighbouring communities to help enhance sustainable development and improve living conditions.

Communal transport: Since 15 May 2009 municipal buses have been free and the Tramway of Aubagne will also be when it opens in 2014. This has reduced the commune&#x27;s transportation-related ecological footprint: 15% more buses have been put into service, and bus usage has increased by 175%, with 35% of these users from modal shift.

Compiègne and Châteauroux have done the same but with goals that are more socioeconomic: making the centre of town more dynamic, improving buying power, reducing isolation, etc.

==Population==
Its inhabitants are known as &quot;Aubagnais&quot; or &quot;Aubagnaises&quot; in French.

==Economy==

===Industry, trade and crafts===
*Industry:
**Zones of Activity (ZAC): Paluds, La Martelle (shops: Auchan and others), Napallon Business Park;
**Thales Underwater Systems currently has one of two establishments in France at Aubagne. The other is at Brest;
*Agriculture: there are farms at various locations in Aubagne (Huveaune Valley, Beaudinard, Napollon);
*Ceramic Crafts:: terracotta, Santon figurines; the appearance of domestic nurseries has allowed the development of Santon makers who now continue this art in a dozen workshops;

*Branch office of the &quot;Chambre de commerce et d&#x27;industrie Marseille-Provence&quot; (Chamber of Commerce and Industry Marseille-Provence).

===Budget and indebtedness===
Aubagne is one of the most indebted cities in France. According to the latest report of the Court of Auditors of PACA (July 2013), the debt amounts to 157.6 million euros. According to a ranking published by &quot;Le Journal du Net&quot;, Aubagne would place 3rd for debt per head of 3,685 Euros per capita - about 5 times the national average. Only Cannes and Levallois-Perret, much richer communes, are higher. The total indebtedness of 119.9 million euros in 2010 exploded in 2013 to reach EUR 157.6 million. The debt servicing payments have at the same time multiplied by 3.1 from 8.626 million euros to 26.933 million euros between 2010 and 2011.

The listing for Aubagne by the French Fitch Ratings agency in 2010 was &quot;BBB−&quot;: &quot;We have downgraded the city of Aubagne due to a strong presence of structured products, along with a very low savings rate and high debt loads. The rating has changed from &quot;A−&quot; to &quot;BBB−&quot; - the lowest category for this investment type&quot; Subsequently the city has not wanted to pursue the issue of its credit status.

In 2009 Aubagne municipality renegotiated certain loans considered &quot;toxic&quot; which were based on risky products contracted with ABN AMRO bank (loans now owned by NatWest Group). Risky loans have been converted to fixed-rate borrowings: less advantageous but less risky. The Court of Auditors in 2013 noted that these renegotiations resulted in additional financial burden borne by the commune of the order of 50 to 70 million Euros (19 million for the Dexia and Caisse d&#x27;Epargne loans and 25 to 43 million for the RBS loan).

Investments in the commune are about half the average for French communes in the same stratum: approximately 13.3% of revenues against 31.4% according to the administrative accounts for the commune in 2012.

Finally the Observatory of subsidies has repeatedly criticized the management of the city of Aubagne, particularly for subsidies not related to the commune or representing a &quot;waste of public money&quot;.

===Taxation===
The 2012 Administrative Accounts for the commune mentions a result of 662 euros per capita tax for Aubagne against 482 euros for the stratum of comparable communes - or higher taxes by 37%.

Aubagne is part of the &quot;Top 20&quot; of towns who have increased their taxes the most in 2012. The city ranks 12th in France for the highest increases in taxes in 2012 according to the website Challenges.fr

===Cinematic heritage===
Aubagne is the birthplace of Marcel Pagnol, home to the University of Image and Sound (Satis department), 9 cinemas (Cinema Palace and Pagnol), and an International Film Festival.

Aubagne is referred to frequently in the film &quot;Manon des Sources&quot;.

The Aubagne Ciné Passion association was founded in late 1989 by Charles Villani at a time when cinema was in crisis. Rapidly bringing in many members, its activity was intense and from 1992 until 1999 it organized the 1st Festival of Passions sponsored by Ticky Holgado and Gérard Jugnot. Thereafter each year the Festival featuring long and short films takes place in October or November. Numerous directors, actors, screenwriters, and producers come to present their works in advance of their premier at the Festival of Passions: Jean-Claude Carrière, John Malkovich, Christopher Lee, Lio, Jean-François Stévenin, Jacques Marin, Carmen Chaplin, Paul Vecchiali, Mathieu Demy, Julie Gayet, Benoît Magimel, Pierre Sullice, Olivier Austen, Luc Palun, Catherine Jacob, Marc de Jonge, Michel Voletti, Pomme Meffre, Yannick Bellon, Franck Fernandel... and of course Ticky Holgado and Gérard Jugnot.
 
In 2000 the City of Aubagne request 3 associations: Alphée (photos), Aubagne Ciné Passion (long films), Méridiens (short films) to merge to organize an international film festival. The association of &quot;Alcimé&quot; was then created, chaired by Charles Villani for its first year and its first festival called FIFA (International Film Festival of Aubagne) that endured. In 2001 differences of perspective caused the departure of Aubagne Ciné Passion from the Alcimé structure. Charles Villani passed the chairmanship to Jean Michel Descombes (General Delegate of the Young Filmmakers Festival of Saint-Jean-de-Luz) and, in 2002, the association went to the nearby commune of Gémenos to organize the RCG (Cinematographers Meetings in Gémenos). Gisèle Mezzina became the president of Aubagne Ciné Passion. Since 2007, the last year of the RCG, the association continues its activities with its circle of members.

==Uniforms and logos==
The Barrie Colts logo displays an angry horse holding a hockeystick, surrounded by a horseshoe. The Colts colours are red, white, navy blue &amp; gold. The home uniforms are a white background, with red, navy blue and gold trim. The away uniforms are a navy blue background, with red, white &amp; gold trim. Barrie also briefly used a third jersey which was a red background, with white, navy blue &amp; gold trim.

For the 2007–08 season, the Colts have worn a new third jersey. It has a navy blue blackground with white, red and gold trim along the bottom, with the word &quot;Colts&quot; diagonally across the front. For the 2009–10 season the colts wore the Rbk Edge uniforms with a new template.

==Arenas==
The Barrie Colts played at the Barrie Arena during their tenure in the Junior B days and Junior A Tier II days, and also for a portion of their inaugural OHL season until their new arena was completed. The Barrie Arena was located in downtown Barrie and was formerly home to the Barrie Flyers OHA team from 1945 to 1960 and other senior hockey teams. The Arena was torn down in 2008.

Barrie Molson Centre was completed during the early portion of the 1995–96 season. The layout of the arena served as a blueprint for many new OHL arenas built shortly thereafter. The Horsepower Grill restaurant is located at the west end of the arena. The Barrie Molson Centre is located near the southern entrance of Park Place, close to Highway 400. The arena has since been renamed &quot;The Barrie Colts Centre&quot; and then, pursuant to a 10-year naming rights agreement with Paul Sadlon Motors Inc. for $170,121 per year (for a total of $1,701,210), beginning in the Colts&#x27; 2021-22 season, the &quot;Sadlon Arena&quot;.

<text>Francis Beaumont ( ; 1584 – 6 March 1616) was a dramatist in the English Renaissance theatre, most famous for his collaborations with John Fletcher.

==Beaumont&#x27;s life==
Beaumont was the son of Sir Francis Beaumont of Grace Dieu, near Thringstone in Leicestershire, a justice of the common pleas. His mother was Anne, the daughter of Sir George Pierrepont (d. 1564), of Holme Pierrepont, and his wife Winnifred Twaits. Beaumont was born at the family seat and was educated at Broadgates Hall (now Pembroke College, Oxford) at age thirteen. Following the death of his father in 1598, he left university without a degree and followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by entering the Inner Temple in London in 1600.

Accounts suggest that Beaumont did not work long as a lawyer. He became a student of poet and playwright Ben Jonson; he was also acquainted with Michael Drayton and other poets and dramatists, and decided that was where his passion lay. His first work, &quot;Salmacis and Hermaphroditus&quot;, appeared in 1602. The 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes the work as &quot;not on the whole discreditable to a lad of eighteen, fresh from the popular love-poems of Marlowe and Shakespeare, which it naturally exceeds in long-winded and fantastic diffusion of episodes and conceits.&quot; In 1605, Beaumont wrote commendatory verses to Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;.

Beaumont&#x27;s collaboration with Fletcher may have begun as early as 1605. They had both hit an obstacle early in their dramatic careers with notable failures; Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot;, first performed by the Children of the Blackfriars in 1607, was rejected by an audience who, the publisher&#x27;s epistle to the 1613 quarto claims, failed to note &quot;the privie mark of irony about it;&quot; that is, they took Beaumont&#x27;s satire of old-fashioned drama as an old-fashioned drama. The play received a lukewarm reception. The following year, Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Faithful Shepherdess&quot; failed on the same stage. In 1609, however, the two collaborated on &quot;Philaster&quot;, which was performed by the King&#x27;s Men at the Globe Theatre and at Blackfriars. The play was a popular success, not only launching the careers of the two playwrights but also sparking a new taste for tragicomedy. According to a mid-century anecdote related by John Aubrey, they lived in the same house on the Bankside in Southwark, &quot;sharing everything in the closest intimacy.&quot; About 1613 Beaumont married Ursula Isley, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Isley of Sundridge in Kent, by whom he had two daughters; Elizabeth and Frances (a posthumous child). He had a stroke between February and October 1613, after which he wrote no more plays, but was able to write an elegy for Lady Penelope Clifton, who died 26 October 1613. Beaumont died in 1616 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Although today Beaumont is remembered as a dramatist, during his lifetime he was also celebrated as a poet.

==Beaumont&#x27;s plays==

It was once written of Beaumont and Fletcher that &quot;in their joint plays their talents are so...completely merged into one, that the hand of Beaumont cannot clearly be distinguished from that of Fletcher.&quot; Yet this romantic notion did not stand up to critical examination.

In the seventeenth century, Sir Aston Cockayne, a friend of Fletcher&#x27;s, specified that there were many plays in the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio that contained nothing of Beaumont&#x27;s work, but rather featured the writing of Philip Massinger. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century critics like E.H.C. Oliphant subjected the plays to a self-consciously literary, and often subjective and impressionistic, reading – but nonetheless began to differentiate the hands of the collaborators. This study was carried much farther, and onto a more objective footing, by twentieth-century scholars, especially Cyrus Hoy. Short of absolute certainty, a critical consensus has evolved on many plays in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators; in regard to Beaumont, the schema below is among the least controversial that has been drawn.

By Beaumont alone:
* &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle,&quot; comedy (performed 1607; printed 1613)
* &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn,&quot; masque (performed 20 February 1613; printed 1613?)

With Fletcher:

* &quot;The Noble Gentleman,&quot; comedy (licensed 3 February 1626; 1647)

Beaumont/Fletcher plays, later revised by Massinger:
* &quot;Thierry and Theodoret,&quot; tragedy (c. 1607?; 1621)
* &quot;The Coxcomb,&quot; comedy (c. 1608–10; 1647)
* &quot;Beggars&#x27; Bush,&quot; comedy (c. 1612–13?; revised 1622?; 1647)
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Cure,&quot; comedy (c. 1612–13?; revised 1625?; 1647)

Because of Fletcher&#x27;s highly distinctive and personal pattern of linguistic preferences and contractional forms (&quot;ye&quot; for &quot;you&quot;, &quot;&#x27;em&quot; for &quot;them&quot;, etc.), his hand can be distinguished fairly easily from Beaumont&#x27;s in their collaborations. In &quot;A King and No King&quot;, for example, Beaumont wrote all of Acts I, II, and III, plus scenes IV. iv and V. ii &amp; iv; Fletcher wrote only the first three scenes in Act IV (IV, i–iii) and the first and third scenes in Act V (V, i &amp; iii) – so that the play is more Beaumont&#x27;s than Fletcher&#x27;s. The same is true of &quot;The Woman Hater&quot;, &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, &quot;The Noble Gentleman,&quot; and &quot;Philaster&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Coxcomb&quot;, &quot;The Scornful Lady&quot;, &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Bush&quot;, and &quot;The Captain&quot; are more Fletcher&#x27;s than Beaumont&#x27;s. In &quot;Love&#x27;s Cure&quot; and &quot;Thierry and Theodoret&quot;, the influence of Massinger&#x27;s revision complicates matters; but in those plays too, Fletcher appears to be the majority contributor, Beaumont the minority.

<doc id="691708" wikidata="Q234405" url="?curid=691708" title="Princess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily">
<text>Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily (14 December 1784 21 May 1806) was the youngest surviving daughter of Ferdinand, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Carolina of Austria. As the wife of the future Ferdinand VII of Spain, then heir apparent to the Spanish throne, she held the title of Princess of Asturias. It was rumoured that her mother-in-law, Maria Luisa of Parma caused her death, but there is no evidence to prove this.

==Early life==
Born at the Caserta Palace in Caserta, Italy, Maria Antonia was the youngest daughter of King Ferdinand IV/III of Naples and Sicily and his first wife, Maria Carolina of Austria. Named after her mother&#x27;s favorite sister, her maternal aunt Queen Marie Antoinette of France, she was an intelligent girl, having learned several languages by the age of seventeen .

=== Marriage ===

In a series of dynastic alliances, Maria Antonia became engaged to her first cousin, Infante Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias (who later became King Ferdinand VII of Spain), while her eldest brother, Francis, became engaged to Infante Ferdinand&#x27;s sister, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain. On 6 October 1802, Maria Antonia married Infante Ferdinand in Barcelona, Spain.

==Princess of Asturias==

The princess failed to provide the expected heir to the throne: her two pregnancies, in 1804 and 1805, ended in miscarriages. Her mother, Maria Carolina, was highly anti-French after the execution of her sister and brother-in-law during the French Revolution. She was also strongly opposed to the military expansion of the French republic. As Spain became more easily dominated by Napoleon Bonaparte, there were rumours that Maria Carolina wanted her daughter to poison the Queen of Spain and Manuel Godoy, Spain&#x27;s prime minister. However, as with most poison rumours of the period, it is unlikely to be true, not least because both women were devout Roman Catholics and secondly because the Spanish court&#x27;s ties to France were in no way greater or lesser than most in Europe&#x27;s after Napoleon’s early victories. Maria Antonia&#x27;s mother-in-law, Queen Maria Luisa, disliked her daughter-in-law and she encouraged rumours of a Habsburg poisoning plot, even subjecting her books and clothes to scrutiny in order to discredit her daughter-in-law further. In spite of all of this campaign of character assassination, Maria Antonia managed to gain considerable influence over her husband and created an opposition party against Queen Maria Luisa and Godoy.

==Death==
Maria Antonia died of tuberculosis on 21 May 1806 at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez in Aranjuez, Spain, at the age of 21. It was rumoured that Maria Antonia had been poisoned by Queen Maria Luisa and Manuel Godoy but there is no evidence to support this claim. However, Queen Maria Carolina, who was devastated, truly believed this. Maria Antonia&#x27;s father, King Ferdinand, consolidated Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies a decade after her death.

The Neapolitan princess was buried at El Escorial in Spain. Her husband was to marry three more times: –

*Infanta Maria Isabel of Portugal in Madrid on 29 September 1816; the couple had a daughter who died young.
*Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony on 20 October 1819, who bore him no children.
*Maria Antonia&#x27;s niece (born a month before her death), Princess Maria Christina of Naples and Sicily (more often known as &quot;of the Two Sicilies&quot;) with whom Ferdinand had the future Isabella II of Spain.

<text>Alison Elizabeth Larter (born February 28, 1976) is an American actress and former model. She portrayed fictional model Allegra Coleman in a 1996 &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine hoax and took on guest roles on several television shows in the 1990s. She made her film debut in &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1999), which was followed by the horror film &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1999). Her role as Clear Rivers in the &quot;Final Destination&quot; franchise (2000–2003) established her as a scream queen.

Larter played supporting roles in &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; (2001), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001) and the romantic comedy &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot; (2005), and main roles in the Bollywood movie &quot;Marigold&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;Obsessed&quot; (2009). She achieved wider recognition for playing the dual roles of Niki Sanders and Tracy Strauss on the NBC science fiction drama &quot;Heroes&quot; (2006–2010), and for portraying the video game heroine Claire Redfield in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series (2007–2016). Larter presently costars as Angela Norris in the Paramount+ drama series &quot;Landman&quot; (2024).

As of April 2017, Larter&#x27;s films have grossed over US$1.31 billion worldwide. Her presence in the media is reinforced by her appearances in lists compiled by &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, and &quot;Stuff&quot;, as well as &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Dressed List&quot; in 2007. She released her cookbook, &quot;Kitchen Revelry: A Year of Festive Menus from My Home to Yours&quot;, in September 2013.

==Early life==
Larter was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, the daughter of Margaret, a realtor, and Danforth Larter, a trucking executive. She attended Carusi Middle School and later graduated from Cherry Hill High School West during her time as a model, but she didn&#x27;t finish her senior year of high school because of modeling. Her mom accompanied her everywhere until she turned 18. Her parents have since moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Larter said she was a tomboy until she turned 13.

==Career==
===1990–1998: Early modeling and television roles===
She began her modeling career at the age of 14 when a modeling scout discovered her on the street and was asked to star in a &quot;Phillies&quot; commercial; this led to a modeling contract with the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency in New York. Larter subsequently skipped her senior year to model in Australia, Italy, and Japan, the latter a country she would temporarily settle in at the age of seventeen. While modeling in Italy, Larter met fellow model and aspiring actress Amy Smart and the two &quot;became instant friends&quot;, according to Larter.

In November 1996, Larter portrayed fictional actress Allegra Coleman in an &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine hoax. When speaking about the cover and her subsequent fame, Larter said, &quot;When the door opens for you in Hollywood, you need to run with it. You know?&quot; Larter is currently signed to IMG Models. She landed her first professional acting roles in 1997 when she appeared in several television programs. She appeared in an episode of the Brooke Shields television series &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;, and the short-lived series &quot;Chicago Sons&quot;. These roles were followed by a number of other appearances on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, and &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;

=== 1999–2005: Film debut and breakthrough ===
In 1999, Larter made her film debut in the coming-of-age dramedy &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;, which re-united her with &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; star James Van Der Beek and close friend Amy Smart. Smart had persuaded Larter to audition for the movie, in which she played Darcy Sears, a love interest for one of the main characters. &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; drew a domestic box office gross of US$53 million. Also in 1999, she made supporting appearances in the teen comedies &quot;Giving It Up&quot; and &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, and starred in the remake &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; which was made for around US$20 million. The horror film, following a group of strangers invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, was panned by critics, but grossed US$15 million on its opening weekend and went on to earn over US$40 million overall.

Larter starred as Clear Rivers, one of the main characters in the teen supernatural horror film &quot;Final Destination&quot; (2000). Also starring Devon Sawa and Kerr Smith, the movie&#x27;s premise followed several teenagers who survive a plane crash but are stalked and killed by Death itself. &quot;Final Destination&quot; made US$112 million by the end of its theatrical run. In 2001, she appeared in the comedy &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with Reese Witherspoon. She played Brooke Taylor Windham, a widow accused of her husband&#x27;s murder. The film earned the top spot with US$20 million in its opening weekend and ended up grossing $141 million worldwide. With US$96 million of its total gross deriving from domestic markets, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is Larter&#x27;s highest-grossing film domestically.

Larter next appeared as Zerelda Mimms in the western comedy &quot;American Outlaws&quot;. Directed by Les Mayfield and co-starring Colin Farrell and Scott Caan, the film was poorly received by critics and at the box office, garnering US$13 million at the end of its theatrical run. She also starred in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.&quot; That year, Larter appeared on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine and performed in the stage play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in New York City. In Spring 2002, Larter moved from Los Angeles to New York. &quot;I was too young and impressionable to handle the pressures of L.A.&quot; Larter recalled in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;m a woman now. I am no longer the little girl who could be easily influenced.&quot; 

Her first project there was to reprise her role as Clear Rivers in the sequel to &quot;Final Destination&quot; entitled &quot;Final Destination 2&quot;. In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: &quot;When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific.&quot; The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller &quot;Three Way&quot;. After doing so, Larter commented about future producing endeavors during an interview for &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;: &quot;I definitely have many ideas and different avenues that I want to take as my career goes on.&quot; In 2005, Larter appeared in the independent political thriller &quot;Confess&quot;, and had a role in the romantic comedy &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher. That same year, she moved back to Los Angeles. 

=== 2006–2011: Rise to prominence and subsequent hiatus ===
After back moving to Los Angeles, her first audition was for the NBC science fiction drama television series &quot;Heroes&quot;. Larter played the characters of Niki Sanders, who suffered from DID, and Tracy Strauss on the show created by Tim Kring. Larter&#x27;s initial character Niki Sanders, was a wife, mother, and a former internet stripper from Las Vegas who exhibits superhuman strength and alternate personalities who go by the names of Jessica and Niki. &quot;Ali read for the part and just owned it from the second she walked in,&quot; Kring said to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;It was a very impressive audition.&quot; As of the third season, Larter began to play the new character of Tracy Strauss, who possessed the ability to freeze objects; and later, turn her body into water.

Larter took on the title role in &quot;Marigold&quot; (2007), alongside Salman Khan. The film was released in August 2007 and revolved around an American actress (Larter) who goes to India and gets caught up in the exotic world of Bollywood. Filming took place in North India and London, commencing in June 2004. In an interview with the BBC, Larter remarked this role was &quot;an opportunity to overcome my fear of singing and dancing because I have no professional training [...] I really focused on the character and loved this journey she went on and the experiences she had.&quot; She was paid a seven-figure salary for her part in the film.

In 2007, she appeared opposite Milla Jovovich in &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, portraying the character of Claire Redfield, who in the film, is the leader of a convoy of zombie apocalypse survivors who go to Alaska in search of a safe haven. Her role sent her to Mexicali, Mexico for filming from May to late July, and required her hair to be dyed a light red. Larter explained her character Claire: &quot;She became the leader of this convoy. She&#x27;s incredibly strong, patient. I think she serves a role for everyone within this convoy, let it be a mother to someone, a buddy, a best friend.&quot; Despite negative reviews, the film made a total of US$147 million worldwide. Also in the same year, she appeared with Hayes McArthur in the comedy &quot;Homo Erectus&quot; and appeared as Evelyn Garland in the biographical drama &quot;Crazy&quot;, based on guitarist Hank Garland.

Larter starred opposite Beyoncé and Idris Elba in the Screen Gems-produced thriller &quot;Obsessed&quot; (2009). The film follows an office executive (Elba) whose marriage to Knowles&#x27; character is threatened by the aggressive interests of a co-worker, portrayed by Larter. In an interview with Glam, Larter said that she &quot;was excited to get the chance to play a femme fatale. I love playing women that are dark and vulnerable and sort of filled with a little bit of crazy emotion.&quot; While the film was released to mixed reviews, Larter was critically praised for her performance. Derek Malcolm of &quot;The London Evening Standard&quot; felt that the movie was a &quot;dim reworking of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;&quot; and noted: &quot;Larter as the pathological minx is the best thing about it.&quot; &quot;Obsessed&quot; opened at top spot in its opening weekend with US$28 million, and made a total domestic gross of US$68 million, becoming Larter&#x27;s second highest-grossing film in North-America. It resulted in Larter&#x27;s third Teen Choice Award nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight with Beyonce.

Larter reprised her role of Claire Redfield in &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; (2010), which was filmed in 3D and saw her character ambushed and mentally manipulated by the fictional Umbrella Corporation, before she is rescued by Alice (Milla Jovovich). Like the previous &quot;Resident Evil&quot; entries, the film received negative reviews but became a major commercial success, earning US$296 million worldwide. On returning to the role of Claire, she stated in an interview with JoBlo.com: &quot;I guess people liked me as her [...] I&#x27;m excited that they brought me back [...] To work with the man [Paul W. S. Anderson] who really created this world and this vision was what excited me about joining this next installment&quot;. In 2010, Larter appeared as the title character in a short film for Absolut Vodka entitled &quot;Lemon Drop&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Afterlife&quot;, Larter took a career hiatus to focus on her family.

===2014–present: Return to acting===
Larter returned to the big screen playing the love interest of a successful but psychotic man (Matt LeBlanc) in the comedy &quot;Lovesick&quot; (2014). The film screened at the 15th annual Newport Beach Film Festival and was released for VOD and selected theaters. She portrayed the &quot;fair-weather&quot; friend of a woman with ALS in the independent drama &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; (2014), directed by George C. Wolfe and starring Hilary Swank, Emmy Rossum and Josh Duhamel.

In 2014, Larter obtained a regular part in the first season of TNT&#x27;s drama series &quot;Legends&quot;, appearing as Crystal McGuire, an operative with the FBI&#x27;s Deep Cover Operations. Larter starred in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Diabolical&quot; as Madison, a single mother who battles evil forces in her house. Released the following year at South by Southwest, it was distributed for a VOD and limited release in certain parts of United States only. The film received largely mixed reviews; Gary Goldstein of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that her &quot;fraught, more seemingly complex [character] remains underdeveloped&quot; in what he described as a &quot;weak horror-thriller&quot;.

Larter starred in &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016), where her role of Claire teams up with Alice (Jovovich) and the Red Queen to save the remnants of humanity. Despite a largely mixed critical response, with a worldwide gross of over US$312 million, the film emerged as her biggest box office success. She played the role of Amelia Slater in the Fox series &quot;Pitch&quot;, about a young black woman who makes history by becoming the first woman to play Major League Baseball. The series ran for one season, which was released in 2016. 

From 2019 to 2020, Larter played the recurring role of Grace Sawyer in the police procedural series &quot;The Rookie&quot;. In 2021, Larter played the Lead Role in the neo-western film &quot;The Last Victim&quot;. She next starred in the thriller &quot;The Man in the White Van&quot;, which premiered at the 2023 Newport Beach Film Festival and was released in December 2024 to mixed reviews.

In 2024, she co-starred in Taylor Sheridan’s show &quot;Landman&quot;, starring Billy Bob Thornton. Larter played a “cartoonish” funny caricature of a gold-digging ex-wife.

==Media image==
Larter first appeared in the media when she portrayed the fictional character of Allegra Coleman in the November 1996 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;. The magazine, which billed Coleman as the movies&#x27; next dream girl, told of Allegra&#x27;s relationship with David Schwimmer, how Quentin Tarantino broke up with Mira Sorvino to date her, and how Woody Allen overhauled a film to give her a starring role. When the magazine was published, &quot;Esquire&quot; received hundreds of phone calls about the non-existent Coleman and various talent agencies sought to represent her, even after the hoax was revealed. Larter herself received a considerable amount of attention after the cover; she received phone calls from morning TV shows and others for interviews.

The &quot;Esquire&quot; cover led Larter to a role on &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;. One particular scene where Larter&#x27;s character, Darcy Sears, wears nothing but whipped cream to cover herself has become a media favorite. It has been referenced a number of times in the media including on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, where one character refers to it as the &quot;Varsity Blues outfit&quot;. Larter has been acknowledged as a scream queen by MSN due to her appearances in horror/thriller films. After the success of &quot;Heroes&quot;, Larter appeared on &quot;People&quot; &quot;Ten Best Dressed List&quot; as &quot;The Newcomer&quot; in 2007. In 2009, Larter was named &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fun Fearless Female of the year at a ceremony held in Beverly Hills.

Larter has appeared on the cover of numerous magazines, including (in alphabetical order) &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (France, Indonesia, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, Turkey and U.S.), &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia Style&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and &quot;Shape&quot;. She has appeared in print ads and commercials throughout her career. In 2004, she appeared in print ads for Estee Lauder cosmetics. She has appeared in commercials for Parfums de Coeur Designer Imposter Body Sprays and Stolichnaya vodka.

In June 2010, Larter was one of thousands of delegates from 130 countries who participated in a United Nations conference, &#x27;Women Deliver&#x27; in Washington, D.C. Larter, along with her husband Hayes MacArthur, hosted The Art of Elysium Gala in 2013 and are to be recipients of the Spirit of Elysium Award at the January 2014 ceremony.

==Personal life==
During her time as a model, Larter moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. In 2002, she moved to New York for a period of three years. In an interview with &quot;Phillymag&quot;, Larter gave reason for the move: 
In January 2005, she moved back to Los Angeles for a role in &quot;Heroes&quot;. In December 2007, Larter and her then longtime boyfriend, Hayes MacArthur, were engaged to marry. They had met on the set of National Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;Homo Erectus&quot;. In a 2007 interview with &quot;Cosmo&quot;, Larter said: &quot;I told my boyfriend after three weeks that I wanted to marry him and that we could do it tomorrow.&quot; On August 1, 2009, Larter married MacArthur at MacArthur&#x27;s parents&#x27; estate in Kennebunkport, Maine; among the invited was Larter&#x27;s close friend Amy Smart. The couple purchased a three-story home in the Hollywood Hills for $2.9 million in 2012. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they moved to Idaho.

On July 20, 2010, Larter announced that she and MacArthur were expecting their first child and later, on the September 10 episode of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, announced that she was expecting a boy. Larter gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son in 2010. In August 2014, Larter confirmed that she and MacArthur were expecting their second child that winter. She gave birth to a girl in 2015. As of 2013, Larter had two dogs, Jackpot and Ella.

<text>Eugene Edward Wood (October 20, 1925 – May 21, 2004) was an American television personality, known primarily for his work as an announcer on various game shows. From the 1950s to the 1990s, he announced many game shows, primarily Mark Goodson–Bill Todman productions such as &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, and &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. Wood also served a brief stint as a host on this last show, and on another show, &quot;Anything You Can Do&quot;. After retiring from game shows in 1996, Wood worked as an announcer for the Game Show Network until his retirement in 1998.

==Early life==
Wood was born in Quincy, Massachusetts. He majored in speech and theater at Emerson College.

==Career==
His early career included stand-up comedy, television commercials, and writing for Bob Keeshan of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; fame. This work included a Terrytoons-produced cartoon series, &quot;The Adventures of Lariat Sam&quot;, which aired on the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; show. Wood also supplied voices and sang the theme song. Wood also had a comedy career, often pairing with partner Bill Dana, performing their comedy act at nightclubs.

His first role as a game show announcer came as a substitute on the ABC version of &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; in 1966; three years later, he began a long association with Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, where he worked on &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; as its announcer from 1969 to 1972; after the departure of the show&#x27;s host, Jack Narz, Wood then took over as host of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, with Nick Holenreich serving as announcer. Wood hosted the 1971–72 season of the short-lived game show &quot;Anything You Can Do,&quot; which featured teams of men competing against teams of women in stunts similar to &quot;Beat the Clock.&quot; He also appeared as a celebrity panelist on one week of &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1974.

By 1976, Wood had become a regular announcer for Goodson–Todman, working as voice-over for many of the company&#x27;s game shows. In addition to his role as announcer, Wood regularly served as a warm-up act for the audiences on these shows, and often performed a series of comedy skits.
Among his most popular jobs was as announcer on the original version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;. The original version, hosted by Richard Dawson, ran on ABC from 1976 to 1985, and when &quot;Family Feud&quot; was revived in 1988 with Ray Combs as host, Wood announced on that version as well through the 1994–1995 season, during which Dawson returned as host. Another show for which he announced on both the original version and a revival was &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. The show&#x27;s first incarnation, starring Jim Perry, ran from 1978 to 1981 on NBC, while two concurrent revivals (one on CBS and another in syndication, hosted by Bob Eubanks and Bill Rafferty, respectively) ran from 1986 to 1989. Wood announced the first few weeks of &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot; on ABC, before being replaced by Marc Summers.

After the 1985 death of the original announcer Johnny Olson on the Bob Barker version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, Wood was one of four interim announcers on that show, until Rod Roddy was chosen as Olson&#x27;s successor. At that same time, Wood also announced on the nightly syndicated version hosted by Tom Kennedy that ran for the season. According to former producer Roger Dobkowitz, between Barker, Goodson &amp; Dobkowitz, himself, felt that his voice was a little on the harsh side and was unsuitable for the show, despite his experience.

Wood returned to &quot;Price&quot; briefly in 1998 to read the summer rerun fee plugs. He also filled in for Olson, during the final weeks of the Tom Kennedy-hosted version of &quot;Body Language&quot;. Other shows on which Wood served as a regular announcer were &quot;Tattletales&quot; (CBS, 1974–78), &quot;Double Dare&quot; (CBS, 1976–77), &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; (NBC, 1983–84), &quot;Password Plus&quot; (NBC, 1979–82), &quot;Super Password&quot; (NBC, 1984–89), &quot;Love Connection&quot; (Syndication, 1985–1988), &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; (NBC, 1987–91), &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; (Syndicated, 1987–90), the Ross Shafer-hosted &quot;Match Game&quot; (1990–91) and Family Challenge (1995–96). Prior to his retirement in the late 1990s, he also did voiceovers for the Game Show Network.

Wood wrote the narration for the 1965 film &quot;The World of Abbott and Costello&quot;.

==Death==
Wood retired to Adamsville, Rhode Island in the 1990s. He died of lung cancer in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 21, 2004.

<text>In mathematics, and particularly in axiomatic set theory, the diamond principle is a combinatorial principle introduced by Ronald Jensen in that holds in the constructible universe () and that implies the continuum hypothesis. Jensen extracted the diamond principle from his proof that the axiom of constructibility () implies the existence of a Suslin tree.

== Definitions ==
The diamond principle says that there exists a , a family of sets for such that for any subset of ω1 the set of with is stationary in .

There are several equivalent forms of the diamond principle. One states that there is a countable collection of subsets of for each countable ordinal such that for any subset of there is a stationary subset of such that for all in we have and . Another equivalent form states that there exist sets for such that for any subset of there is at least one infinite with .

More generally, for a given cardinal number and a stationary set , the statement (sometimes written or ) is the statement that there is a sequence such that

* each 
* for every , is stationary in 

The principle is the same as .

The diamond-plus principle states that there exists a -sequence, in other words a countable collection of subsets of for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset of there is a closed unbounded subset of such that for all in we have and .

== Properties and use ==
 showed that the diamond principle implies the existence of Suslin trees. He also showed that implies the diamond-plus principle, which implies the diamond principle, which implies CH. In particular the diamond principle and the diamond-plus principle are both independent of the axioms of ZFC. Also implies , but Shelah gave models of , so and are not equivalent (rather, is weaker than ).

Matet proved the principle formula_1 equivalent to a property of partitions of formula_2 with diagonal intersection of initial segments of the partitions stationary in formula_2.

The diamond principle does not imply the existence of a Kurepa tree, but the stronger principle implies both the principle and the existence of a Kurepa tree.

 used to construct a -algebra serving as a counterexample to Naimark&#x27;s problem.

For all cardinals and stationary subsets , holds in the constructible universe. proved that for , follows from for stationary that do not contain ordinals of cofinality .

Shelah showed that the diamond principle solves the Whitehead problem by implying that every Whitehead group is free.

<text>The Desert Eagle or &quot;Deagle&quot; is a single-action, gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol capable of chambering the .50 Action Express, the largest centerfire cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol and famous for other large caliber chamberings.

Magnum Research Inc. (MRI) designed and developed the Desert Eagle. The design was further refined by (and was also manufactured by) Israel Military Industries (IMI), until 1995, when MRI shifted the manufacturing contract to Saco Defense, in Saco, Maine. In 1998, MRI moved manufacturing back to IMI, which later commercialized its small arms branch under the name Israel Weapon Industries. Since December 2009, the Desert Eagle pistol has been produced in the United States at MRI&#x27;s Pillager, Minnesota, facility. Kahr Arms acquired Magnum Research in 2010.

Magnum Research has marketed various versions of the short recoil Jericho 941 pistol under the Baby Eagle and Desert Eagle pistol names; these weapons are not directly related to the Desert Eagle, but share a similar visual design.

== Design ==


The design for the Desert Eagle was initiated by Bernard C. White of Magnum Research and Arnolds Streinbergs of Riga Arms Institute, who filed a US patent application for a mechanism for a gas-actuated pistol in January 1983. This established the basic layout of the Desert Eagle. A second patent application was filed in December 1985, after the basic design had been refined by IMI Systems (Israel Military Industries) for production, and this is the form that went into production.

The pistol is fired by a single-action hammer and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum mechanism that sits over the firing pin, causing the firing pin to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces the possibility of the gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases, allowing the hammer to fall downward, hitting the firing pin, and causing the chambered round to discharge.

The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated ejection and chambering mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blowback designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel in front of the chamber. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder underneath the front of the barrel. The slide, which acts as the bolt carrier, has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder, the piston pushes the slide rearward, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt causing the bolt to rotate and unlock. A mechanism on the left side of the bolt prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, forcing it to remain aligned correctly with the barrel while the breech is open. The spring-loaded ejector is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and the tension from the ejector is released, causing the case to eject, breaking free of the extractor in the process. The slide reaches its rearmost position, and then moves forward again under the tension of the recoil springs. The bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again.

The rotating bolt has three radial locking lugs (the fourth lug is only for pushing the next round in the chamber), with the extractor on the right-hand side fitting where the fifth lug would be, and strongly resembles the seven-lug bolt of the M16 series of rifles, while the fixed gas cylinder and moving piston resemble those of the Ruger Mini-14 carbine (the original patent used a captive piston similar to the M14 rifle).

The advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. Thus, it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas-operated mechanism are the large size of the Desert Eagle, and the fact that it discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing can clog the gas release tap, preventing proper function.

Switching a Desert Eagle to another chambering requires only that the correct barrel, bolt assembly, and magazine be installed. Thus, a conversion to fire other cartridges can be quickly accomplished. The rim diameter of the .50 AE (Action Express) is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge, consequently, only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a .44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful, .50 AE round. The most popular barrel length is 6 in (152 mm), although a 10 in (254 mm) barrel is available. The Mark XIX barrels are machined with integral scope mounting bases, simplifying the process of adding a pistol scope.

The Desert Eagle is fed with a detachable magazine. Magazine capacity is nine rounds in .357 Magnum, eight rounds in .44 Magnum, and seven rounds in .50 Action Express. The Desert Eagle&#x27;s barrel features polygonal rifling. The pistol is primarily used for hunting, target shooting, and silhouette shooting.

== Variants ==

=== Marks I and VII ===

The Mark I, which is no longer produced, was offered with a steel, stainless steel, or aluminum alloy frame and differs primarily in the size and shape of the safety levers and slide catch. The Mark VII includes an adjustable trigger (retrofittable to Mark I pistols). The Mark I and VII are both available in .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum; the Mark VII has been chambered for .41 Magnum. The barrels have a in dovetail, to which an accessory mount can be attached. Later Mark VII models were offered in .50 Action Express with a in Weaver-pattern rail on the barrel; the .50 Mark VII later became the Mark XIX. Barrel lengths are 6, 10, and 14 inches for .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum, but only 6 or 10 inches for .41 Magnum.

=== Mark XIX ===
The most recent model, the Mark XIX, is available in .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, .429 DE (introduced in 2018) and .50 Action Express. This model comes in a variety of different finishes, such as brushed chrome or titanium gold. Magnum Research offered this model in .440 Cor-Bon caliber, a .50 AE derived case. There were fewer than 500 original .440 Cor-Bon Desert Eagles imported into U.S. in December 2000. These are marked by the number 440 on the left lower side of the barrel, in numerals twice the size of other calibers, and without the preceding period. A number of .44 Magnum barrels were re-chambered to produce .440 Corbon barrels, but these can be identified by the off-centered &quot;.440&quot; (with period) produced by adding the final 0 to the original barrel mark.

Mark XIX barrels are available in and lengths only. All .357 Magnum barrels have exterior barrel flutes on the left, right and top sides of the barrel. All .44 Magnum barrels have flutes on the left and right side only, not on the top. The .50 AE barrels have no flutes.

All current-production Mark XIX models except for the CA approved models have Weaver rails along the top of the barrels, as opposed to the Dovetail rails on previous models. Selected Mark XIX models have ported barrels or under-barrel picatinny rails.

The DE44CA (Desert Eagle .44 Magnum California) is the only Mark XIX model approved for dealer sales to the public in the State of California. The California-approved version differs from the regular XIX models in that it has an automatic firing pin block and a two-slot Weaver-style rail for mounting optics.

== In popular culture ==

The Desert Eagle has been featured in more than 600 films, television shows and video games, making it well known in popular culture. The commercial success of the pistol is due in part to its use in films, according to Magnum Research chairman and CEO John Risdall. According to a 1994 newspaper article, the company actively solicited prop houses to use the gun. By 2000, it had been used in over 40 films, including &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;Eraser&quot;, &quot;Red Heat&quot;, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, &quot;Assassins&quot;, &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Double Impact&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, and the television series Reacher, season one.

<doc id="691741" wikidata="Q600043" url="?curid=691741" title="Character theory">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in group theory, the character of a group representation is a function on the group that associates to each group element the trace of the corresponding matrix. The character carries the essential information about the representation in a more condensed form. Georg Frobenius initially developed representation theory of finite groups entirely based on the characters, and without any explicit matrix realization of representations themselves. This is possible because a complex representation of a finite group is determined (up to isomorphism) by its character. The situation with representations over a field of positive characteristic, so-called &quot;modular representations&quot;, is more delicate, but Richard Brauer developed a powerful theory of characters in this case as well. Many deep theorems on the structure of finite groups use characters of modular representations.

== Applications ==
Characters of irreducible representations encode many important properties of a group and can thus be used to study its structure. Character theory is an essential tool in the classification of finite simple groups. Close to half of the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem involves intricate calculations with character values. Easier, but still essential, results that use character theory include Burnside&#x27;s theorem (a purely group-theoretic proof of Burnside&#x27;s theorem has since been found, but that proof came over half a century after Burnside&#x27;s original proof), and a theorem of Richard Brauer and Michio Suzuki stating that a finite simple group cannot have a generalized quaternion group as its Sylow -subgroup.

==Definitions==
Let be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field and let be a representation of a group on . The character of is the function given by

:formula_1

where is the trace.

A character is called irreducible or simple if is an irreducible representation. The degree of the character is the dimension of ; in characteristic zero this is equal to the value . A character of degree 1 is called linear. When is finite and has characteristic zero, the kernel of the character is the normal subgroup:

:formula_2

which is precisely the kernel of the representation . However, the character is &quot;not&quot; a group homomorphism in general.

==Properties==
* Characters are class functions, that is, they each take a constant value on a given conjugacy class. More precisely, the set of irreducible characters of a given group into a field form a basis of the -vector space of all class functions .
* Isomorphic representations have the same characters. Over a field of characteristic , two representations are isomorphic if and only if they have the same character.
* If a representation is the direct sum of subrepresentations, then the corresponding character is the sum of the characters of those subrepresentations.
* If a character of the finite group is restricted to a subgroup , then the result is also a character of .
* Every character value is a sum of -th roots of unity, where is the degree (that is, the dimension of the associated vector space) of the representation with character and is the order of . In particular, when , every such character value is an algebraic integer.
* If and is irreducible, then formula_3 is an algebraic integer for all in .
* If is algebraically closed and does not divide the order of , then the number of irreducible characters of is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of . Furthermore, in this case, the degrees of the irreducible characters are divisors of the order of (and they even divide if ).

===Arithmetic properties===
Let ρ and σ be representations of . Then the following identities hold:
*formula_4
*formula_5
*formula_6
*formula_7
*formula_8
where {{math|&quot;ρ&quot;⊕&quot;σ&quot;}} is the direct sum, {{math|&quot;ρ&quot;⊗&quot;σ&quot;}} is the tensor product, {{math|&quot;ρ&quot;∗}} denotes the conjugate transpose of {{mvar|ρ}}, and {{math|Alt2}} is the alternating product {{math|Alt2&quot;ρ&quot; {{=}} &quot;ρ&quot; ∧ &quot;ρ&quot;}} and {{math|Sym2}} is the symmetric square, which is determined by
formula_9

==Character tables==
{{Further|Character table}}
The irreducible complex characters of a finite group form a character table which encodes much useful information about the group {{mvar|G}} in a compact form. Each row is labelled by an irreducible representation and the entries in the row are the characters of the representation on the respective conjugacy class of {{mvar|G}}. The columns are labelled by (representatives of) the conjugacy classes of {{mvar|G}}. It is customary to label the first row by the character of the trivial representation, which is the trivial action of {{mvar|G}} on a 1-dimensional vector space by formula_10 for all formula_11. Each entry in the first row is therefore 1. Similarly, it is customary to label the first column by the identity. Therefore, the first column contains the degree of each irreducible character.

Here is the character table of

:formula_12

the cyclic group with three elements and generator &quot;u&quot;:

where {{mvar|ω}} is a primitive third root of unity.

The character table is always square, because the number of irreducible representations is equal to the number of conjugacy classes.

===Orthogonality relations===
{{main|Schur orthogonality relations}}
The space of complex-valued class functions of a finite group {{mvar|G}} has a natural inner product:

:formula_13

where {{math|{{overline|&quot;β&quot;(&quot;g&quot;)}}}} is the complex conjugate of {{math|&quot;β&quot;(&quot;g&quot;)}}. With respect to this inner product, the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis for the space of class-functions, and this yields the orthogonality relation for the rows of the character table:

:formula_14

For {{math|&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;}} in {{mvar|G}}, applying the same inner product to the columns of the character table yields:

:formula_15

where the sum is over all of the irreducible characters {{math|&quot;χi&quot;}} of {{mvar|G}} and the symbol {{math|{{pipe}}&quot;CG&quot;(&quot;g&quot;){{pipe}}}} denotes the order of the centralizer of {{mvar|g}}. Note that since {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} are conjugate iff they are in the same column of the character table, this implies that the columns of the character table are orthogonal.

The orthogonality relations can aid many computations including:
* Decomposing an unknown character as a linear combination of irreducible characters.
* Constructing the complete character table when only some of the irreducible characters are known.
* Finding the orders of the centralizers of representatives of the conjugacy classes of a group.
* Finding the order of the group.

===Character table properties===
Certain properties of the group {{mvar|G}} can be deduced from its character table:

* The order of {{mvar|G}} is given by the sum of the squares of the entries of the first column (the degrees of the irreducible characters). More generally, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the entries in any column gives the order of the centralizer of an element of the corresponding conjugacy class.
*All normal subgroups of {{mvar|G}} (and thus whether or not {{mvar|G}} is simple) can be recognised from its character table. The kernel of a character {{mvar|χ}} is the set of elements {{mvar|g}} in {{mvar|G}} for which {{math|&quot;χ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) {{=}} &quot;χ&quot;(1)}}; this is a normal subgroup of {{mvar|G}}. Each normal subgroup of {{mvar|G}} is the intersection of the kernels of some of the irreducible characters of {{mvar|G}}.
*The commutator subgroup of {{mvar|G}} is the intersection of the kernels of the linear characters of {{mvar|G}}.
*If {{mvar|G}} is finite, then since the character table is square and has as many rows as conjugacy classes, it follows that {{mvar|G}} is abelian iff each conjugacy class is a singleton iff the character table of {{mvar|G}} is formula_16 iff each irreducible character is linear.
*It follows, using some results of Richard Brauer from modular representation theory, that the prime divisors of the orders of the elements of each conjugacy class of a finite group can be deduced from its character table (an observation of Graham Higman).

The character table does not in general determine the group up to isomorphism: for example, the quaternion group {{mvar|Q}} and the dihedral group of {{math|8}} elements, {{math|&quot;D&quot;4}}, have the same character table. Brauer asked whether the character table, together with the knowledge of how the powers of elements of its conjugacy classes are distributed, determines a finite group up to isomorphism. In 1964, this was answered in the negative by E. C. Dade.

The linear representations of {{mvar|G}} are themselves a group under the tensor product, since the tensor product of 1-dimensional vector spaces is again 1-dimensional. That is, if formula_17 and formula_18 are linear representations, then formula_19 defines a new linear representation. This gives rise to a group of linear characters, called the character group under the operation formula_20. This group is connected to Dirichlet characters and Fourier analysis.

==Induced characters and Frobenius reciprocity==
{{main|Induced character|Frobenius reciprocity}}
The characters discussed in this section are assumed to be complex-valued. Let {{mvar|H}} be a subgroup of the finite group {{mvar|G}}. Given a character {{mvar|χ}} of {{mvar|G}}, let {{math|&quot;χH&quot;}} denote its restriction to {{mvar|H}}. Let {{mvar|θ}} be a character of {{mvar|H}}. Ferdinand Georg Frobenius showed how to construct a character of {{mvar|G}} from {{mvar|θ}}, using what is now known as &quot;Frobenius reciprocity&quot;. Since the irreducible characters of {{mvar|G}} form an orthonormal basis for the space of complex-valued class functions of {{mvar|G}}, there is a unique class function {{math|&quot;θG&quot;}} of {{mvar|G}} with the property that

:formula_21

for each irreducible character {{mvar|χ}} of {{mvar|G}} (the leftmost inner product is for class functions of {{mvar|G}} and the rightmost inner product is for class functions of {{mvar|H}}). Since the restriction of a character of {{mvar|G}} to the subgroup {{mvar|H}} is again a character of {{mvar|H}}, this definition makes it clear that {{math|&quot;θG&quot;}} is a non-negative integer combination of irreducible characters of {{mvar|G}}, so is indeed a character of {{mvar|G}}. It is known as &quot;the character of&quot; {{mvar|G}} &quot;induced from&quot; {{mvar|θ}}. The defining formula of Frobenius reciprocity can be extended to general complex-valued class functions.

Given a matrix representation {{mvar|ρ}} of {{mvar|H}}, Frobenius later gave an explicit way to construct a matrix representation of {{mvar|G}}, known as the representation induced from {{mvar|ρ}}, and written analogously as {{math|&quot;ρG&quot;}}. This led to an alternative description of the induced character {{math|&quot;θG&quot;}}. This induced character vanishes on all elements of {{mvar|G}} which are not conjugate to any element of {{mvar|H}}. Since the induced character is a class function of {{mvar|G}}, it is only now necessary to describe its values on elements of {{mvar|H}}. If one writes {{mvar|G}} as a disjoint union of right cosets of {{mvar|H}}, say

:formula_22

then, given an element {{mvar|h}} of {{mvar|H}}, we have:

:formula_23

Because {{mvar|θ}} is a class function of {{mvar|H}}, this value does not depend on the particular choice of coset representatives.

This alternative description of the induced character sometimes allows explicit computation from relatively little information about the embedding of {{mvar|H}} in {{mvar|G}}, and is often useful for calculation of particular character tables. When {{mvar|θ}} is the trivial character of {{mvar|H}}, the induced character obtained is known as the permutation character of {{mvar|G}} (on the cosets of {{mvar|H}}).

The general technique of character induction and later refinements found numerous applications in finite group theory and elsewhere in mathematics, in the hands of mathematicians such as Emil Artin, Richard Brauer, Walter Feit and Michio Suzuki, as well as Frobenius himself.

==Mackey decomposition==
The Mackey decomposition was defined and explored by George Mackey in the context of Lie groups, but is a powerful tool in the character theory and representation theory of finite groups. Its basic form concerns the way a character (or module) induced from a subgroup {{mvar|H}} of a finite group {{mvar|G}} behaves on restriction back to a (possibly different) subgroup {{mvar|K}} of {{mvar|G}}, and makes use of the decomposition of {{mvar|G}} into {{math|(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;)}}-double cosets.

If formula_24 is a disjoint union, and {{mvar|θ}} is a complex class function of {{mvar|H}}, then Mackey&#x27;s formula states that

:formula_25

where {{math|&quot;θt&quot;}} is the class function of {{math|&quot;t&quot;−1&quot;Ht&quot;}} defined by {{math|&quot;θt&quot;(&quot;t&quot;−1&quot;ht&quot;) {{=}} &quot;θ&quot;(&quot;h&quot;)}} for all {{mvar|h}} in {{mvar|H}}. There is a similar formula for the restriction of an induced module to a subgroup, which holds for representations over any ring, and has applications in a wide variety of algebraic and topological contexts.

Mackey decomposition, in conjunction with Frobenius reciprocity, yields a well-known and useful formula for the inner product of two class functions {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ψ}} induced from respective subgroups {{mvar|H}} and {{mvar|K}}, whose utility lies in the fact that it only depends on how conjugates of {{mvar|H}} and {{mvar|K}} intersect each other. The formula (with its derivation) is:

:formula_26

(where {{mvar|T}} is a full set of {{math|(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;)}}-double coset representatives, as before). This formula is often used when {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ψ}} are linear characters, in which case all the inner products appearing in the right hand sum are either {{math|1}} or {{math|0}}, depending on whether or not the linear characters {{math|&quot;θt&quot;}} and {{mvar|ψ}} have the same restriction to {{math|&quot;t&quot;−1&quot;Ht&quot; ∩ &quot;K&quot;}}. If {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|ψ}} are both trivial characters, then the inner product simplifies to {{math|{{pipe}}&quot;T&quot;{{pipe}}}}.

==&quot;Twisted&quot; dimension==
One may interpret the character of a representation as the &quot;twisted&quot; dimension of a vector space. Treating the character as a function of the elements of the group {{math|&quot;χ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;)}}, its value at the identity is the dimension of the space, since {{math|&quot;χ&quot;(1) {{=}} Tr(&quot;ρ&quot;(1)) {{=}} Tr(&quot;IV&quot;) {{=}} dim(&quot;V&quot;)}}. Accordingly, one can view the other values of the character as &quot;twisted&quot; dimensions.{{clarify|date=June 2011|reason=recursive definition}}

One can find analogs or generalizations of statements about dimensions to statements about characters or representations. A sophisticated example of this occurs in the theory of monstrous moonshine: the {{mvar|j}}-invariant is the graded dimension of an infinite-dimensional graded representation of the Monster group, and replacing the dimension with the character gives the McKay–Thompson series for each element of the Monster group.

==Characters of Lie groups and Lie algebras==
{{See also|Weyl character formula|Algebraic character}}

If formula_27 is a Lie group and formula_28 a finite-dimensional representation of formula_27, the character formula_30 of formula_28 is defined precisely as for any group as
:formula_32.
Meanwhile, if formula_33 is a Lie algebra and formula_28 a finite-dimensional representation of formula_33, we can define the character formula_30 by
:formula_37.
The character will satisfy formula_38 for all formula_39 in the associated Lie group formula_40 and all formula_41. If we have a Lie group representation and an associated Lie algebra representation, the character formula_30 of the Lie algebra representation is related to the character formula_43 of the group representation by the formula
:formula_44.

Suppose now that formula_33 is a complex semisimple Lie algebra with Cartan subalgebra formula_46. The value of the character formula_30 of an irreducible representation formula_28 of formula_33 is determined by its values on formula_46. The restriction of the character to formula_46 can easily be computed in terms of the weight spaces, as follows:
:formula_52,
where the sum is over all weights formula_53 of formula_28 and where formula_55 is the multiplicity of formula_53.

The (restriction to formula_46 of the) character can be computed more explicitly by the Weyl character formula.

<doc id="691742" wikidata="Q1272738" url="?curid=691742" title="Domo (NHK)">
<text>is the official mascot of Japan&#x27;s public broadcaster NHK, appearing in several 30-second stop-motion interstitial sketches, which are shown as station identification in between the channel&#x27;s programming. The character is a furry monster that is boxy and brown and often has his big mouth wide open.

==Origin==
Domo-kun first appeared in short stop-motion sketches on December 22, 1998, to mark the 10th anniversary of NHK&#x27;s satellite broadcasting.
The name &quot;Domo&quot; was acquired during the second episode of his show, in which a TV announcer said , which is a greeting that can be translated as &quot;Well, hello there!&quot;, but which can also be interpreted as &quot;Hello, Domo&quot;, and thus is a convenient pun (&quot;dajare&quot;). The kun suffix on &quot;Domo-kun&quot;, the name used to describe the character in the Japanese versions, is a Japanese honorific often used with young males.

==Development==
Tsuneo Gōda, a stop motion animator and character designer, created Domo for NHK in 1998 and directed a stop motion animated TV series based on the character in 2008. Gōda says that by using stop motion one can &quot;create a work filled with feeling&quot;.

==Characters==
Domo, the main character, is a brown, furry monster with a large, sawtoothed mouth that is locked wide open. His favorite food is nikujaga, a Japanese meat and potato stew. According to a Tokyopop press release of the Domo comic book, Domo &quot;communicates sotto voce with a verve that only his friends can understand.&quot; Domo can only say his name. Clint Bickham, the writer of the Domo comic book, said that to him Domo&#x27;s expression is &quot;a sort of cheery wonderment. Like when a kid wakes to a room full of presents on Christmas day.&quot; While Domo&#x27;s face has variants, to Bickham most of his expressions have &quot;an underlying sense of fascination.&quot; Domo is known to pass gas repeatedly when nervous or upset. He also sweats when nervous.

Domo lives in a cave with Mr. Usaji, known in Japanese-language versions as , a portmanteau of the words , (rabbit), and (old man, grandpa). Mr. Usaji is a wise old rabbit who has lived in a cave for decades, loves to watch television and drink astringent green tea. Mr. Usaji is not into any &quot;new&quot; materials, and does not own a telephone. In terms of fashion, Mr. Usaji focuses on materials instead of shapes. Mr. Usaji&#x27;s favorite food is carrots, and his least favorite food is &quot;something that is meaningless.&quot;

Also in the cave live two bats, a mother named Maya ( in the Japanese version) and her child Mario ( in the Japanese version). Maya suffers from alcoholism; her favorite foods are seasonal while her least favorite food is alcohol. Mario&#x27;s favorite food is Japanese-style tomato spaghetti, while his least favorite food is shiitake mushrooms.

The other main character in the shorts is a Polar bear or weasel girl named Tashanna ( in the Japanese version). Tashanna, 17 years old, is a weasel who aspires to be a fashion stylist or model in Tokyo and is always using technology (televisions, mobile phones, and cameras). In English Tashanna has a (bear in mind weasels in Japan are not associated with underhandedness) and ends her sentences with &quot;y&quot;s. In the Japanese version, she ends her sentences with &quot;chi&quot; (ち). She has not had a boyfriend in ten years and she is seeking a platonic boyfriend. She has a passion for bidding in auctions, but she gives up by the end. Tashanna&#x27;s favorite food is apricot and mint tarts, and her least favorite food is sea urchin. The Japanese name originates from the word of digital broadcasting.

Bear Boy (), also known as , is a Moon Bear and one of Domo&#x27;s friends from the neighborhood; the timid cub enjoys playing baseball.

Hee () and Haw () are pixie twins from a flower. Domo is the only individual who can see them.

The Fox Trio consists of Esther (), , and Fox Boy (). Esther, the youngest member, enjoys producing crocodile tears, plotting schemes, and causing havoc. Brother Fox, the eldest member, dutifully cares for his youngest siblings and feels upset when referred to as . Fox Boy, having a quiet demeanor, converses with Domo and Bear Boy and prefers to read.

, a large and powerful Brown bear, feels too hungry to take advantage of his strength.

The Ghost () randomly appears and disappears.

==In other media==
*A stop-motion children&#x27;s television series based on the character, titled Domo TV, was co-produced by Nickelodeon and NHK. It was first announced in 2006 and premiered in October 2008 on Nicktoons Network. It continued to air until February 2009. Later that year, Nickelodeon also aired a series of 7-Eleven advertisements featuring Domo. &quot;Domo TV&quot; was released to DVD on July 1, 2009, along with every Domo commercial that had been produced to that date.
*Tokyopop published an original English-language manga based on the character titled Domo: The Manga in the United States and Canada. Clint Bickham created the stories and crafted the dialog; Bickham said that he did &quot;pretty much everything short of drawing it.&quot; The stories were drawn by Priscilla Hamby (aka Rem), Lindsay Cibos, Jared Hodges, Sonia Leong, Maximo V. Lorenzo (in the special 7-11 edition only) and Erie Horita. Bickham decided to use a series of short stories instead of one long story to &quot;recreate the feel of the original series,&quot; &quot;so hopefully, reading a story from the manga will feel the same as watching an episode of the show.&quot; Bickham said that writing the stories became entertaining when he &quot;got into the Domo mindset.&quot; The writer said that Domo&#x27;s thoughts do not need to be expressed in words as they are &quot;always very simple and innocent.&quot; Bickham added that sometimes other characters speak for him. Bickham said that the &quot;Domo: the Manga&quot; stories &quot;are driven by situations instead of dialogue.&quot; To prepare for writing the series, Bickham watched each episode multiple times; Bickham intended to &quot;get a feel for the characters so that the jump from stop-motion to manga would be as seamless as possible.&quot; He added that &quot;more than anything, I had to have fun doing it. I don&#x27;t think you can create a good Domo story without fun.&quot;
*On February 5, 2014, Domo celebrated its 15th anniversary with &quot;Domo Hollywood e Iku!&quot; (Domo Goes to Hollywood!), a television special which was premiered on March 28, 2014.
*In September 2015, the first music compilation based on Domo, &quot;Domo Loves Chiptune&quot;, was released on iTunes, Amazon, and all major music streaming services. The compilation features top artists in the Chiptune genre such Anamanaguchi and Disasterpeace. A Domo Loves Christmas compilation was released in November 2015.
*Domo became well known outside Japan through a mock public service announcement that circulated on the Internet depicting Domos chasing a kitten with the words stating: &quot;Every time you masturbate... God kills a kitten.&quot; An article from &quot;ICv2&quot; stated: &quot;This phony PSA is quite out of character with Domo&#x27;s image in Japan.&quot;
*Domo has 5 video games on the DSiWare on the Nintendo DSi Shop application for the Nintendo DSi. The 5 games are Crash-Course Domo, Hard-Hat Domo, Rock-n-Roll Domo, Pro-Putt Domo and White-Water Domo. The Game Boy Advance game Domo-kun no Fushigi Terebi also features Domo-kun.

<text>Philip Ranulph de Glanville (born 1 October 1968 in Loughborough) is a former English rugby union player who played at centre for Bath and England.

==Rugby career==
de Glanville played for Durham University while an Economics and Politics student, then at Oxford University won a Blue with Oxford University RFC and also represented England U21s and England Students.

de Glanville joined Bath in 1989 and captained them to a league and cup double in 1996, partnering Jeremy Guscott in the centre for this club that season, as well as many others. He played 201 times for Bath over a 12-year career, scoring 53 tries. He started for Bath in the victorious 1998 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Brive.

He made his England debut as a replacement in the match against the Springboks in 1992. Many of de Glanville&#x27;s international caps were earned in a replacement role, as the incumbent centres were Will Carling (long-serving England captain) and Jeremy Guscott. De Glanville is seen as likely to have won many more caps if it weren&#x27;t for this firmly entrenched Carling-Guscott combination, a pairing solidified by early Carling-Guscott successes like the 1991 Rugby World Cup.

In the Autumn of 1996 coach Jack Rowell appointed him as England captain following Will Carling&#x27;s decision to step-down, following England&#x27;s 1996 Five Nations Championship win. However, there was criticism of his inclusion in the starting XV for the 1997 Five Nations as it wasn&#x27;t felt that he was in good enough form to be guaranteed a place in the team. He was not selected for that summer&#x27;s Lions tour to South Africa losing his place to uncapped Will Greenwood. Under new coach Clive Woodward in autumn 1997 he lost both the captaincy to Lawrence Dallaglio and his starting position to Greenwood, though he remained a valued squad member. He showed some very good form in the 1999 world cup, particularly in the pool game against New Zealand. In total he won 38 caps for England and started in the centre throughout the 1994/1995 season, including an outstanding performance in the first tour to South Africa after apartheid, where he played in both test matches. He was involved in over 60 England match day squads

==After rugby==
Chiding his renowned good-looks, teammates often referred to de Glanville as &quot;Hollywood&quot;; a trait seemingly incongruous with his hard, committed playing style.

In 2003 he competed in the BBC&#x27;s Superstars television show, winning the kayaking and golf events but eventually coming last in the final. He was a regional member of Sport England and from 2012 to 2015 was the Director of Elite Sport at Hartpury College. He went into executive search with Hanover Fox UK in 2015 and is one of the three current owners of the business having bought it in 2019.

De Glanville lives in Bath, UK.

He is the father of rugby player Tom de Glanville.

<text>Marian Chace (31 October 1896 – 19 July 1970) is one of the founders of modern dance therapy.

Marian Chace was born 31 October 1896 in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Daniel Champlin Chace, a journalist and editor, and Harriet Edgaretta (Northrop) Chace. Her younger siblings were Marjorie (1899–1991), Olive (1905–1977), and Edgar Northrop Chace (1908–1983).

She studied modern dance and choreography with Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis at the Denishawn School of Dance and started work as a dance performer. She later moved to Washington, D.C., and opened her own studio. As she developed her teaching she believed that the body and mind are interrelated, and was influenced by the work of Harry Stack Sullivan.

She began to teach in Washington D.C. and Wondered why people who were not wanting to be performers continued to take dance classes. She began to change her teaching methods as she observed her students closely. Her students reported feelings of well being which intrigued local doctors, some of the National Institutes of Health, who began to send some of their patients to her classes. Her approach developed into the use of body action, symbolism, therapeutic movement relationship, and rhythmic group activity when she eventually joined the staff at St. Elizabeths hospital in southeast Washington D.C. and studied at the Washington School of Psychiatry. Chace taught in schools and hospitals advocating and lecturing on the therapeutic benefits of dance/body movement.

She worked for number of years with patients at Chestnut Lodge in Rockville Maryland. She taught a course at Turtle Bay Music school in New York City for a number of years. With others in the field she enabled the founding of the American Dance Therapy Association in 1966 and became its first president.

<doc id="691761" wikidata="Q168929" url="?curid=691761" title="Campo Grande">
<text>Campo Grande (, ) is a city in the central and western region of Brazil, capital of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Historically a stronghold of separatists from the North and South, founded by José Antônio Pereira, the city is planned in the middle of a vast green space, with wide streets and tree-lined avenues with several gardens along the way. It is one of the most wooded cities in Brazil, with 96.3% of houses in shade.

The region where the city is located was in the past a waypoint for travellers who wanted to go from São Paulo or Minas Gerais to northern Mato Grosso by land. In the early 1900s, a railway was completed, connecting Campo Grande to Corumbá on the Bolivian border and to Bauru, São Paulo. Also in the beginning of the 20th century, the Western Brazilian Army Headquarters was established in Campo Grande, making it an important military center.

With a population growth from 140,000 people in 1970 to 750,000 people in 2007, Campo Grande is the third largest urban center of the Center-West region, and the 17th largest city in the country. In 1977, the State of Mato Grosso was split into two, and Campo Grande became the capital of the new state of Mato Grosso do Sul, comprising the southern portion of the former state. By that time, Campo Grande had long surpassed the latter&#x27;s capital city of Cuiabá in population, which is unusual in Brazil, where most capitals are also the states&#x27; largest cities.

Today, the city has its own culture, which is a mixture of several ethnic groups, most notably immigrants from the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa, Middle Easterners, Armenians, Portuguese people, Germans, Italians, Spaniards, and Paraguayans, finally mixed with Asian and European Brazilians from the Brazilian Southern and Southeast regions, its native Amerindian peoples and Afro-Brazilians.

==History==
Campo Grande started as a small village founded in 1877 by farmers José Antônio Pereira and Manoel Vieira de Sousa (a.k.a. Manoel Olivério), who came from Minas Gerais just after the end of the Paraguayan War. They founded the village, known at that time as Santo Antônio de Campo Grande, near the Serra de Maracaju cliffs, at the confluence of two streams named Prosa and Segredo (Portuguese for &quot;conversation&quot; and &quot;secret,&quot; respectively), whose courses now coincide with two of the city&#x27;s most important avenues. In the end of 1877, the founder built the village&#x27;s first church. The roughly aligned houses formed the first street, known as Rua Velha (Old Street), today Rua 26 de Agosto (26 August Street). This street ended where today one finds a square in honor of the immigrants that later came to the city. In 1930, the city was the theater of a small conflict involving governmental forces, led by Getulio Vargas, and indigenous groups. The rebels seized large parts of the city until government reinforcement reached and ended the conflict.

The city started to develop relatively fast because of its privileged climate and location. These factors drew people from other regions of the country, especially the South, the Southeast and the Northeast regions. The settlement was officially recognized as a municipality by the State Government on August 26, 1899, and renamed Campo Grande.

==Geography==
=== Vegetation ===
The vegetation in Campo Grande and Central Brazil is a tropical savanna called &quot;Cerrado&quot; that varies from pure grassland to a nearly closed canopy of medium height trees overlying grass. Since forest is the expected climax vegetation there, several theories have been given to explain the types of grassland present.

The most promising of these involve differences in soil properties, but only a few sites have been used for evaluation. The 1960s marked the beginning of the expansion of large-scale agriculture across the Cerrado. The state is one of the largest producers of soybeans in the world.

The municipality contains the Matas do Segredo State Park, created in 2000 to protect an area of &quot;cerrado&quot; forest.
and the Prosa State Park, created in 2002.

===Climate===
Campo Grande has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;), just slightly drier than a tropical monsoon climate, with a mild appearance of cold air masses on the southern edge of the tropics. It has semi-humid, hot summers, and notably seasonal, with a dry winter season from June through September, but without major irregularities in the precipitation. Its altitude a few hundred meters higher than in the surrounding swamps and its location in the interior of South America, gives a much more extreme climate than several Brazilian cities, although still moderate. In addition, the flood is one of the problems seen in the city, the result of intense rains that occur in a short period. Annual rainfall averages . January is the warmest and rainiest month, with mean highs of 29 °C (84.2 °F) and lows of 20 °C (68.0 °F).

July brings on sunny days but cooler temperatures, with mean highs of 25 °C (77.0 °F) and lows of 14 °C (57.2 °F). Occasional near-freezing temperatures can occur on winter&#x27;s coldest nights.

==Economy==
Most of the city&#x27;s active economic labor is absorbed by the tertiary sector (commerce and services). In spite of that, the primary and secondary sectors, especially agribusiness, still play an important role in the local economy. The farming of bovine livestock supplies local slaughterhouses, which in turn allows Campo Grande to export meat to other states in Brazil and abroad. In addition to food processing and agribusiness, construction and non-metallic mineral processing are important. The area&#x27;s most important crops are soy, rice and manioc. Recently, sugar cane is becoming important as well. According to IBGE, Campo Grande has a total of 11,657 commercial and 1,300 industrial enterprises.

The city&#x27;s GDP was R$ 20,7 billion (about US$ 9,59 billions) in 2013, ranks as the richest city in the state, the third in the Central-West region of the country, and the 33rd richest in Brazil (2013).

Per capita income was R$24.839 in 2013 (about US$11,511).

==Education==
Portuguese is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

===Educational institutions===
The city has several universities. The most notable ones are:
* Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS) (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul);
* Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (UEMS) (State University of Mato Grosso do Sul);
* Universidade Católica Dom Bosco (UCDB) (Dom Bosco Catholic University);
* Faculdade Campo Grande (FCG) (Campo Grande College);
* Centro Universitário de Campo Grande (UNAES) (Academic Center of Campo Grande).
* Universidade para Desenvolvimento do Estado e da Regiao do Pantanal (UNIDERP) (Academic Center of Campo Grande).

==Transportation==

===International Airport===

The operation of Campo Grande International Airport is shared with Campo Grande Air Force Base. The airport has two runways.
The airport can receive medium-sized jets such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320, but occasional operations of larger jets have occurred. Operations are mostly domestic, but there are also a few flights to Bolivia and Paraguay.

Campo Grande Air Force Base - ALA5, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Campo Grande.

===Railroad===

Campo Grande is served by a system of railway transport under administration of the Novoeste company, interconnecting with other cities in the state, in a line that goes from Bauru and São Paulo state through Campo Grande all the way to Corumbá and on to Bolivia. This mode of transport has had significant effects on the transport infrastructure, allowing the export of products to other centres of production and consumption. Currently, no passenger services are operated, only freight trains.

===Highways===
Three main federal highways intersect at Campo Grande. BR-262 links Campo Grande to Corumbá and Bolivia to the west, and the Brazilian State of São Paulo to the east. BR-163 connects Campo Grande to Cuiabá and the Amazon region to the north, and to Dourados (which is from the Paraguayan border) to the south. BR-060 links Campo Grande to the state of Goiás and the national capital city of Brasília to the northeast. There are also several state highways converging there.

==Culture==

Festas Juninas were introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese and the custom spread to the rest of the country, including Campo-Grande, where festivities take place with the usual fare of typical foods and decoration, rural costumes, music, dancing, a bonfire, and fireworks.

The Campo Grande Film Festival is held annually in the months of January and February since 2004. It focuses on independent cinema, presenting Brazilian and foreign films alike, as well as regional and short films.

==Sports==

===Car racing===

The city has a car racing and a kart racing track. Orlando Moura International Autodrome has a 3,433-metre (11,263 ft.) runway, and Kartódromo Ayrton Senna a 930-metre (3,051 ft.) runway.

===Football===
As in all of Brazil, the most popular sport in Campo Grande is football. The city has a major football stadium, Estádio Universitário Pedro Pedrossian, popularly known as &quot;Morenão&quot; (&quot;the big brown&quot; in Portuguese, after the city&#x27;s nickname and the Brazilian custom of often giving names derived of augmentatives to football stadiums). The stadium was opened in 1971 and accommodates up to 45,000 people. There are five other minor stadiums in the city, which occasionally host competition games. The city&#x27;s main teams are Esporte Clube Comercial and Operário Futebol Clube.

Additionally, there are 45 multisport playing fields in the city, in clubs, cultural associations and public squares.

===Volta das Nações===

&quot;Volta das nações&quot; is a mini-marathon of 21 km that takes place at Parque das Nações Indígenas every October, where around 26.4 thousand people participate, including professional athletes from Kenya and other parts of the world.

==Notable people==
 
*Rafael Silva, judoka
*Leonardo de Deus, swimmer
*Müller, footballer
*Hoover Orsi (born 1978), racing driver
*Aracy Balabanian (born 1940), Brazilian actress of Armenian descent

==International relations==

===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Campo Grande is twinned with:
* Pedro Juan Caballero, Amambay Department, Paraguay
* Turin, Piedmont, Italy

<doc id="691765" wikidata="Q3088276" url="?curid=691765" title="Polyform">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a polyform is a plane figure or solid compound constructed by joining together identical basic polygons. The basic polygon is often (but not necessarily) a convex plane-filling polygon, such as a square or a triangle. More specific names have been given to polyforms resulting from specific basic polygons, as detailed in the table below. For example, a square basic polygon results in the well-known polyominoes.

==Construction rules==
The rules for joining the polygons together may vary, and must therefore be stated for each distinct type of polyform. Generally, however, the following rules apply:
#Two basic polygons may be joined only along a common edge, and must share the entirety of that edge.
#No two basic polygons may overlap.
#A polyform must be connected (that is, all one piece; see connected graph, connected space). Configurations of disconnected basic polygons do not qualify as polyforms.
#The mirror image of an asymmetric polyform is not considered a distinct polyform (polyforms are &quot;double sided&quot;).

==Generalizations==
Polyforms can also be considered in higher dimensions. In 3-dimensional space, basic polyhedra can be joined along congruent faces. Joining cubes in this way produces the polycubes, and joining tetrahedrons in this way produces the polytetrahedrons. 2-dimensional polyforms can also be folded out of the plane along their edges, in similar fashion to a net; in the case of polyominoes, this results in polyominoids.

One can allow more than one basic polygon. The possibilities are so numerous that the exercise seems pointless, unless extra requirements are brought in. For example, the Penrose tiles define extra rules for joining edges, resulting in interesting polyforms with a kind of pentagonal symmetry.

When the base form is a polygon that tiles the plane, rule 1 may be broken. For instance, squares may be joined orthogonally at vertices, as well as at edges, to form hinged/pseudo-polyominos, also known as polyplets or polykings.

==Types and applications==
Polyforms are a rich source of problems, puzzles and games. The basic combinatorial problem is counting the number of different polyforms, given the basic polygon and the construction rules, as a function of &quot;n&quot;, the number of basic polygons in the polyform.

<doc id="691782" wikidata="Q1448819" url="?curid=691782" title="Ginger beer">
<text>Traditional ginger beer is a sweetened and carbonated, usually non-alcoholic beverage. Historically it was produced by the natural fermentation of prepared ginger spice, yeast and sugar.

Modern ginger beers are often manufactured rather than brewed, frequently with flavour and colour additives, with artificial carbonation. Ginger ales are not brewed.

Ginger beer is still produced at home using a symbiotic colony of yeast and a &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; (bacteria) known as a &quot;ginger beer plant&quot; or from a &quot;ginger bug&quot; starter created from fermenting ginger, sugar, and water.

==History==

Brewed ginger beer originated in Yorkshire in England in the mid-18th century and became popular throughout Britain, the United States, Ireland, South Africa, The Caribbean and Canada, reaching a peak of popularity in the early 20th century.

==Production==

===Alcoholic ginger beer===

Brewed ginger beer originated in the UK, but is sold worldwide. It is usually labelled &quot;alcoholic ginger beer&quot; to distinguish it from the more established commercial ginger beers, which are often not brewed using fermentation but carbonated with pressurized carbon dioxide, though traditional non-alcoholic ginger beer may also be produced by brewing.

====Ginger beer plant====
Ginger beer plant (GBP), a form of fermentation starter, is used to create the fermentation process. Ginger beer was defined by Harry Marshall Ward as “beverage containing a symbiotic mixture of yeast and bacteria, and containing sufficient amounts of nitrogenous organic matter and beet sugar or cane sugar in its aqueous solution”. The GBP was first described by Ward in 1892, from samples he received in 1887.

Also known as &quot;bees wine&quot;, &quot;Palestinian bees&quot;, &quot;Californian bees&quot;, and &quot;balm of Gilead&quot;, it is not a plant but a composite organism comprising the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces florentinus&quot; (formerly &quot;S. pyriformis&quot;) and the bacterium &quot;Lactobacillus hilgardii&quot; (formerly &quot;Brevibacterium vermiforme&quot;), which form a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). It forms a gelatinous substance that allows it to be easily transferred from one fermenting substrate to the next, much like kefir grains, kombucha, and tibicos.
Original ginger beer is brewed by leaving water, sugar, ginger, optional ingredients such as lemon juice and cream of tartar, and GBP to ferment for several days, converting some of the sugar into alcohol. GBP may be obtained from several commercial sources. Until about 2008 laboratory-grade GBP was available only from the yeast bank Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen in Germany (catalogue number DMS 2484), but the item is no longer listed. The National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC) had an old sample of &quot;Bees wine&quot; , but current staff have not used it, and NCYC are unable to supply it for safety reasons, as the exact composition of the sample is unknown.

In the UK, the origins of the original ginger beer plant is unknown. When a batch of ginger beer was made using some ginger beer &quot;plant&quot; (GBP), the jelly-like residue was also bottled and became the new GBP. Some of this GBP was kept for making the next batch of ginger beer, and some was given to friends and family, so the plant was passed on through generations. Following Ward&#x27;s research and experiments, he created his own ginger beer from a new plant that he had made, and he proposed, but did not prove, that the plant was created by contaminants found on the raw materials, with the yeast coming from the raw brown sugar and the bacteria coming from the ginger root.

====Yeast starter====
An alternative method of instigating fermentation is using a ginger beer starter, often called a &quot;ginger bug&quot;, which can be made by fermenting a mixture of water, brewer&#x27;s or baker&#x27;s yeast (not the SCOBY described above), ginger, and sugar. This is kept for a week or longer, with sugar regularly added, &quot;e.g.&quot;, daily, to increase alcohol content. More ginger may also be added. When finished, this concentrated mix is strained, diluted with water and lemon juice, and bottled. This is the process used by some commercial ginger beer makers. Ginger beer made from a yeast-based starter is reported to not have the same taste or mouth feel as that made with ginger beer plant. The near-complete loss of the ginger beer plant is likely due to the decrease in home brewing and the increased commercial production of ginger beer in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Large-scale breweries favoured the use of yeast, as used in conventional beer-making, because of ease for scaled production.

===Ginger beer soft drink===
Non-alcoholic ginger beer is commonly a type of carbonated soft drink flavoured with ginger.

However, some non-alcoholic ginger beers are made by brewing, followed by heating to reduce alcohol content to below 0.5% ABV, below which beverages are legally classified as &quot;non-alcoholic&quot; in many jurisdictions.

==Mixed drinks==

The ginger beer soft drink may be mixed with beer (usually a British ale of some sort) to make one type of shandy, or with dark rum to make a drink, originally from Bermuda, called a Dark &#x27;N&#x27; Stormy. It is the main ingredient in the Moscow Mule cocktail, though ginger ale may be substituted when ginger beer is unavailable.

<doc id="691790" wikidata="Q6641390" url="?curid=691790" title="List of statements independent of ZFC">
<text>The mathematical statements discussed below are independent of ZFC (the canonical axiomatic set theory of contemporary mathematics, consisting of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms plus the axiom of choice), assuming that ZFC is consistent. A statement is independent of ZFC (sometimes phrased &quot;undecidable in ZFC&quot;) if it can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of ZFC.

==Axiomatic set theory==

In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his incompleteness theorems, establishing that many mathematical theories, including ZFC, cannot prove their own consistency. Assuming ω-consistency of such a theory, the consistency statement can also not be disproven, meaning it is independent. A few years later, other arithmetic statements were defined that are independent of any such theory, see for example Rosser&#x27;s trick. 

The following set theoretic statements are independent of ZFC, among others:
* the continuum hypothesis or CH (Gödel produced a model of ZFC in which CH is true, showing that CH cannot be disproven in ZFC; Paul Cohen later invented the method of forcing to exhibit a model of ZFC in which CH fails, showing that CH cannot be proven in ZFC. The following four independence results are also due to Gödel/Cohen.);
* the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH); 
* a related independent statement is that if a set &quot;x&quot; has fewer elements than &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; also has fewer subsets than &quot;y&quot;. In particular, this statement fails when the cardinalities of the power sets of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; coincide;
* the axiom of constructibility (&quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot;); 
* the diamond principle (◊);
* Martin&#x27;s axiom (MA);
* MA + ¬CH (independence shown by Solovay and Tennenbaum).
* Every Aronszajn tree is special (EATS);

We have the following chains of implications:
:&quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot; → ◊ → CH,
:&quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot; → GCH → CH,
:CH → MA,
and (see section on order theory):
:◊ → ¬SH,
:MA + ¬CH → EATS → SH.

Several statements related to the existence of large cardinals cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). These are independent of ZFC provided that they are consistent with ZFC, which most working set theorists believe to be the case. These statements are strong enough to imply the consistency of ZFC. This has the consequence (via Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem) that their consistency with ZFC cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). The following statements belong to this class:
* Existence of inaccessible cardinals
* Existence of Mahlo cardinals
* Existence of measurable cardinals (first conjectured by Ulam)
* Existence of supercompact cardinals

The following statements can be proven to be independent of ZFC assuming the consistency of a suitable large cardinal:
* Proper forcing axiom
* Open coloring axiom
* Martin&#x27;s maximum
* Existence of 0#
* Singular cardinals hypothesis
* Projective determinacy (and even the full axiom of determinacy if the axiom of choice is not assumed)

==Set theory of the real line==

There are many cardinal invariants of the real line, connected with measure theory and statements related to the Baire category theorem, whose exact values are independent of ZFC. While nontrivial relations can be proved between them, most cardinal invariants can be any regular cardinal between ℵ1 and 2ℵ0. This is a major area of study in the set theory of the real line (see Cichon diagram). MA has a tendency to set most interesting cardinal invariants equal to 2ℵ0.

A subset &quot;X&quot; of the real line is a strong measure zero set if to every sequence (&quot;εn&quot;) of positive reals there exists a sequence of intervals (&quot;In&quot;) which covers &quot;X&quot; and such that &quot;In&quot; has length at most &quot;εn&quot;. Borel&#x27;s conjecture, that every strong measure zero set is countable, is independent of ZFC.

A subset &quot;X&quot; of the real line is formula_1-dense if every open interval contains formula_1-many elements of &quot;X&quot;. Whether all formula_1-dense sets are order-isomorphic is independent of ZFC.

==Order theory==

Suslin&#x27;s problem asks whether a specific short list of properties characterizes the ordered set of real numbers R. This is undecidable in ZFC. A &quot;Suslin line&quot; is an ordered set which satisfies this specific list of properties but is not order-isomorphic to R. The diamond principle ◊ proves the existence of a Suslin line, while MA + ¬CH implies EATS (every Aronszajn tree is special), which in turn implies (but is not equivalent to) the nonexistence of Suslin lines. Ronald Jensen proved that CH does not imply the existence of a Suslin line.

Existence of Kurepa trees is independent of ZFC, assuming consistency of an inaccessible cardinal.

Existence of a partition of the ordinal number formula_4 into two colors with no monochromatic uncountable sequentially closed subset is independent of ZFC, ZFC + CH, and ZFC + ¬CH, assuming consistency of a Mahlo cardinal. This theorem of Shelah answers a question of H. Friedman.

==Abstract algebra==

In 1973, Saharon Shelah showed that the Whitehead problem (&quot;is every abelian group &quot;A&quot; with Ext1(A, Z) = 0 a free abelian group?&quot;) is independent of ZFC. An abelian group with Ext1(A, Z) = 0 is called a Whitehead group; MA + ¬CH proves the existence of a non-free Whitehead group, while &quot;V&quot; = &quot;L&quot; proves that all Whitehead groups are free.
In one of the earliest applications of proper forcing, Shelah constructed a model of ZFC + CH in which there is a non-free Whitehead group.

Consider the ring &quot;A&quot; = R[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;] of polynomials in three variables over the real numbers and its field of fractions &quot;M&quot; = R(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;). The projective dimension of &quot;M&quot; as &quot;A&quot;-module is either 2 or 3, but it is independent of ZFC whether it is equal to 2; it is equal to 2 if and only if CH holds.

A direct product of countably many fields has global dimension 2 if and only if the continuum hypothesis holds.

==Number theory==

One can write down a concrete polynomial &quot;p&quot; ∈ Z[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;9] such that the statement &quot;there are integers &quot;m&quot;1, ..., &quot;m&quot;9 with &quot;p&quot;(&quot;m&quot;1, ..., &quot;m&quot;9) = 0&quot; can neither be proven nor disproven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). This follows from Yuri Matiyasevich&#x27;s resolution of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem; the polynomial is constructed so that it has an integer root if and only if ZFC is inconsistent.

==Measure theory==

A stronger version of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for positive functions, where the function is no longer assumed to be measurable but merely that the two iterated integrals are well defined and exist, is independent of ZFC. On the one hand, CH implies that there exists a function on the unit square whose iterated integrals are not equal — the function is simply the indicator function of an ordering of [0, 1] equivalent to a well ordering of the cardinal ω1. A similar example can be constructed using MA. On the other hand, the consistency of the strong Fubini theorem was first shown by Friedman. It can also be deduced from a variant of Freiling&#x27;s axiom of symmetry.

==Topology==

The Normal Moore Space conjecture, namely that every normal Moore space is metrizable, can be disproven assuming the continuum hypothesis or assuming both Martin&#x27;s axiom and the negation of the continuum hypothesis, and can be proven assuming a certain axiom which implies the existence of large cardinals. Thus, granted large cardinals, the Normal Moore Space conjecture is independent of ZFC.

The existence of an S-space is independent of ZFC. In particular, it is implied by the existence of a Suslin line.

==Functional analysis==

Garth Dales and Robert M. Solovay proved in 1976 that Kaplansky&#x27;s conjecture, namely that every algebra homomorphism from the Banach algebra &quot;C(X)&quot; (where &quot;X&quot; is some compact Hausdorff space) into any other Banach algebra must be continuous, is independent of ZFC. CH implies that for any infinite &quot;X&quot; there exists a discontinuous homomorphism into any Banach algebra.

Consider the algebra &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of bounded linear operators on the infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. The compact operators form a two-sided ideal in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;). The question of whether this ideal is the sum of two properly smaller ideals is independent of ZFC, as was proved by Andreas Blass and Saharon Shelah in 1987.

Charles Akemann and Nik Weaver showed in 2003 that the statement &quot;there exists a counterexample to Naimark&#x27;s problem which is generated by ℵ1, elements&quot; is independent of ZFC.

Miroslav Bačák and Petr Hájek proved in 2008 that the statement &quot;every Asplund space of density character ω1 has a renorming with the Mazur intersection property&quot; is independent of ZFC. The result is shown using Martin&#x27;s maximum axiom, while Mar Jiménez and José Pedro Moreno (1997) had presented a counterexample assuming CH.

As shown by Ilijas Farah and N. Christopher Phillips and Nik Weaver, the existence of outer automorphisms of the Calkin algebra depends on set theoretic assumptions beyond ZFC.

Wetzel&#x27;s problem, which asks if every set of analytic functions which takes at most countably many distinct values at every point is necessarily countable, is true if and only if the continuum hypothesis is false.

==Model theory==

Chang&#x27;s conjecture is independent of ZFC assuming the consistency of an Erdős cardinal.

==Computability theory==

Marcia Groszek and Theodore Slaman gave examples of statements independent of ZFC concerning the structure of the Turing degrees. In particular, whether there exists a maximally independent set of degrees of size less than continuum.

<text>In graph theory, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is a problem about graph coloring, named after Paul Erdős, Vance Faber, and László Lovász, who formulated it in 1972. It says:

:If complete graphs, each having exactly vertices, have the property that every pair of complete graphs has at most one shared vertex, then the union of the graphs can be properly colored with  colors.

The conjecture for all sufficiently large values of was proved by Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kühn, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus.

==Equivalent formulations==
 introduced the problem with a story about seating assignment in committees: suppose that, in a university department, there are committees, each consisting of faculty members, and that all committees meet in the same room, which has chairs. Suppose also that at most one person belongs to the intersection of any two committees. Is it possible to assign the committee members to chairs in such a way that each member sits in the same chair for all the different committees to which he or she belongs? In this model of the problem, the faculty members correspond to graph vertices, committees correspond to complete graphs, and chairs correspond to vertex colors.

A &quot;linear hypergraph&quot; (also known as partial linear space) is a hypergraph with the property that every two hyperedges have at most one vertex in common. A hypergraph is said to be uniform if all of its hyperedges have the same number of vertices as each other. The cliques of size in the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be interpreted as the hyperedges of an -uniform linear hypergraph that has the same vertices as the underlying graph. In this language, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture states that, given any -uniform linear hypergraph with hyperedges, one may -color the vertices such that each hyperedge has one vertex of each color.

A &quot;simple hypergraph&quot; is a hypergraph in which at most one hyperedge connects any pair of vertices and there are no hyperedges of size at most one. In the graph coloring formulation of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture, it is safe to remove vertices that belong to a single clique, as their coloring presents no difficulty; once this is done, the hypergraph that has a vertex for each clique, and a hyperedge for each graph vertex, forms a simple hypergraph.
And, the hypergraph dual of vertex coloring is edge coloring. Thus, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any simple hypergraph with vertices has chromatic index (edge coloring number) at most .

The graph of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture may be represented as an intersection graph of sets: to each vertex of the graph, correspond the set of the cliques containing that vertex, and connect any two vertices by an edge whenever their corresponding sets have a nonempty intersection. Using this description of the graph, the conjecture may be restated as follows: if some family of sets has total elements, and any two sets intersect in at most one element, then the intersection graph of the sets may be -colored.

The intersection number of a graph is the minimum number of elements in a family of sets whose intersection graph is , or equivalently the minimum number of vertices in a hypergraph whose line graph is . define the linear intersection number of a graph, similarly, to be the minimum number of vertices in a linear hypergraph whose line graph is . As they observe, the Erdős–Faber–Lovász conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the chromatic number of any graph is at most equal to its linear intersection number.

 present another yet equivalent formulation, in terms of the theory of clones.

==History, partial results, and eventual proof==
Paul Erdős, Vance Faber, and László Lovász formulated the harmless-looking conjecture at a party in Boulder, Colorado in September 1972. Its difficulty was realised only slowly.
Paul Erdős originally offered US$50 for proving the conjecture in the affirmative, and later raised the reward to US$500. In fact, Paul Erdős considered this to be one of his three most favourite combinatorial problems.

 proved that the chromatic number of the graphs in the conjecture is at most formula_1, and improved this to .

In 2023, almost 50 years after the original conjecture was stated, it was resolved for all sufficiently large by Dong Yeap Kang, Tom Kelly, Daniela Kühn, Abhishek Methuku, and Deryk Osthus.

==Related problems==
It is also of interest to consider the chromatic number of graphs formed as the union of cliques of vertices each, without restricting how big the intersections of pairs of cliques can be. In this case, the chromatic number of their union is at most , and some graphs formed in this way require this many colors.

A version of the conjecture that uses the fractional chromatic number in place of the chromatic number is known to be true. That is, if a graph is formed as the union of -cliques that intersect pairwise in at most one vertex, then can be -colored.

In the framework of edge coloring simple hypergraphs, defines a number from a simple hypergraph as the number of hypergraph vertices that belong to a hyperedge of three or more vertices. He shows that, for any fixed value of , a finite calculation suffices to verify that the conjecture is true for all simple hypergraphs with that value of . Based on this idea, he shows that the conjecture is indeed true for all simple hypergraphs with . In the formulation of coloring graphs formed by unions of cliques, Hindman&#x27;s result shows that the conjecture is true whenever at most ten of the cliques contain a vertex that belongs to three or more cliques. In particular, it is true for .

<doc id="691819" wikidata="Q821141" url="?curid=691819" title="List of Nashville Predators players">
<text>The Nashville Predators are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1997, and played their first game during the 1998–99 season. At the end of the 2018–19 season, 280 players, 17 goaltenders and 263 skaters (forwards and defenseman), have played at least one game for Predators in the regular or post-season.

==Key==
* Appeared in a Predators game during the 2023–24 season.



&quot;The &quot;Seasons&quot; column lists the first year of the season of the player&#x27;s first game and the last year of the season of the player&#x27;s last game. For example, a player who played one game in the 2000–2001 season would be listed as playing with the team from 2000–2001, regardless of what calendar year the game occurred within.&quot;

&quot;Statistics complete as of the 2023–2024 NHL season.&quot;

==Skaters==



==Notes==
a: As of the 2005–06 season, all games have a winner; teams losing in overtime and shootouts are awarded one point thus the OTL stat replacees the tie statistic. The OTL column also includes SOL (Shootout losses).

<doc id="691822" wikidata="Q5259222" url="?curid=691822" title="Denny Triangle, Seattle">
<text>The Denny Triangle is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, that stretches north of Downtown Seattle to the grounds of the Seattle Center. Its generally flat terrain was originally a steep hill, taken down as part of a mammoth construction project in the first decades of the 20th century known as the Denny Regrade, which is another name for the neighborhood on the regraded area. The name Denny Triangle, referring to the northeastern portion of this regrading project, is a term that has gained currency as this neighborhood has seen increasing development in the first decades of the 21st century.
As with most Seattle neighborhoods, the Denny Triangle has no formal borders. The Seattle City Clerk&#x27;s Neighborhood Map Atlas (which is published by the city but does not have official status as defining neighborhoods) defines the Denny Regrade as bounded on the north by Denny Way, on the southwest by Third Avenue, on the southeast by Olive Way, with a small eastern border on Interstate 5. A 2009 map from northwestplaces.com treats the term &quot;Denny Regrade&quot; as synonymous with Belltown and shows both names as referring to a triangle bounded on the north by Denny Way, on the southwest by Western Avenue (two blocks inland of the Central Waterfront), and on the southeast by Stewart Street; the southern tip of this triangle falls in the northern part of Pike Place Market. A map on downtownseattle.com agrees on the northern boundary at Denny Way, but splits this area into &quot;Belltown&quot; and the Denny Triangle and gives both a less regular shape. They divide Belltown to the southwest from the Denny Triangle to the northeast, with the border running mainly along Fifth Avenue but including a small number of properties along Denny Way west of Fifth Avenue as being in the Denny Triangle. They mark the southwest border of Belltown as a block closer to the water (Elliott Avenue) and draw a more ragged southeast border: west of Fifth Avenue, Belltown extends south only to Lenora Street, while east of Fifth Avenue the Denny Triangle is bounded in its westernmost block by Virginia Street and (once it crosses Westlake Avenue) by Olive Way, and with an eastern border on the same small piece of Interstate 5 as the City Clerk&#x27;s map.

==Denny Hill==
Seattle is located on an isthmus between Lake Washington on the east and Puget Sound on the west. The north-south orientation of the lake and of the city&#x27;s many hills is the result of glaciation. The terrain was first gouged by south-moving glaciers, and when they retreated, was marked by mounds of rock debris left in their wake. Denny and Queen Anne Hills are two of those north of what is now downtown Seattle. Denny Hill was removed in a series of regrades beginning in 1898 and ending in 1930.

==Regrading projects==
The Denny Regrade project was the removal of Denny Hill, one of the proverbial seven hills of Seattle. It ran east from First Avenue between Pike Street and Denny Way. Hill and street were named after the Denny family, who were among the city&#x27;s earliest white inhabitants. The First Avenue regrade was started in 1897 and completed on January 6, 1899. From 1902 to 1911, the hill was sluiced into Elliott Bay by pumping water from Lake Union using hydraulic mining techniques, in a series of regrades along Pike and Pine Streets, Second Avenue, and the massive Denny Regrade No. 1 which regraded everything remaining between Fifth Avenue and the waterfront. In 1929–30, Denny Regrade No. 2 removed the final pieces of the hill east of Fifth Avenue using steam shovels.

<doc id="691824" wikidata="Q2849587" url="?curid=691824" title="Angie Aparo">
<text>James Angelo &quot;Angie&quot; Aparo is an American musician and songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia.

Aparo began playing in a group called Angie&#x27;s Hope in the early 1990s before making the decision to go solo. After making that decision, Aparo chose to go out on the road touring with his acoustic guitar in the Southeast. In 1996, he released his first album, &quot;Out of the Everywhere,&quot; recorded at David Briggs Studio in Nashville, Tennessee with Jim Stabile as engineer.

In 1999, with Matt Serletic, Aparo released his second studio album &quot;The American&quot;. His single, &quot;Spaceship,&quot; was released in 2000 and became one of his biggest hits. &quot;The American&quot; also includes his original version of the song &quot;Cry&quot;, made popular by Faith Hill and featured on her album of the same name. Faith Hill&#x27;s husband Tim McGraw also covered &quot;Free Man&quot; from &quot;The American&quot;.

Following record label issues, Aparo released the independent album &quot;Weapon of Mass Construction&quot; (2001) (Later re-released under the title &quot;One With the Sun&quot;), a CD of cover songs taken from varying artists from Beastie Boys to Neil Young and Elton John, as well as two previously unreleased originals. In his own words, &quot;It was fun, and I got it out of my system.&quot;

In 2003, he released another album, &quot;For Stars and Moon,&quot; again independently.

Aparo put together backing band The Infidels and toured the Southeast while recording a 2006&#x27;s EP &quot;El Primero Del Tres&quot; with producer Dann Huff. The Infidels consists of Derek Murphy (&quot;The American&quot;, &quot;9Live&quot;, &quot;One With the Sun&quot;, &quot;For Stars and Moon&quot;, &quot;Praise Be&quot;), Mark Dannells, Martin Lesch (&quot;For Stars and Moon&quot;), and Shannon Woods. Aparo also released the album &quot;Praise Be&quot; that year.

In 2009, Aparo contributed the song &quot;Junkyard&quot; with the Zac Brown Band on their album &quot;Pass The Jar – Zac Brown Band And Friends From The Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta (Live)&quot;.

In April 2016, Aparo suffered torn carotid artery, which caused a stroke that initially immobilized him and rendered him unable to speak or remember his songs.

In February 2018 he released the album &quot;Life Is a Flower, Life Is a Gun.&quot;

<doc id="691826" wikidata="Q15999952" url="?curid=691826" title="Proctor">
<text>Proctor (a variant of &quot;&quot;) is a person who takes charge of, or acts for, another.

The title is used in England and some other English-speaking countries in three principal contexts:
# In law, a proctor is a historical class of lawyers, and the King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Proctor is a senior government lawyer.
# In religion, a proctor represents the clergy in Church of England dioceses.
# In education, proctor is the name of university officials in certain universities.

In the United States and some other countries, the word &quot;proctor&quot; is frequently used to describe someone who supervises an examination (i.e. a supervisor or invigilator).

==Law==
===England===
A proctor was a legal practitioner in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts in England. These courts were distinguished from the common law courts and courts of equity because they applied &quot;civil law&quot; derived from Roman law, instead of English common law and equity. Historically, proctors were licensed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to undertake the duties that were performed in common law courts by attorneys and in the courts of equity by solicitors. Proctors were attached to the Doctors&#x27; Commons, which performed a similar function for civil law or &quot;civilian&quot; advocates (the doctors) to that of the Inns of Court for barristers. Reforms in the mid-19th century removed the monopoly of the civilian doctors and proctors in the family and admiralty courts, leaving only the ecclesiastical Court of Arches. Later, the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, which created the Supreme Court of Judicature, combined the three roles (proctor, attorney, and solicitor) into the common profession of &quot;solicitor of the Supreme Court&quot;.

====King/Queen&#x27;s Proctor====
The King/Queen&#x27;s Proctor is the historical name for an official who acted for the Crown in certain courts in England. The modern name of the office is HM Procurator-General, and this office has for many years been combined with that of the Treasury Solicitor, whose formal title is His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Procurator-General and Treasury Solicitor.

In the admiralty courts, the King/Queen&#x27;s Proctor historically acted in all causes concerning the King or Queen. A proctor or procurator was an officer who, in conjunction with the King/Queen&#x27;s Proctor, acted as the attorney or solicitor in all causes concerning the Lord High Admiral&#x27;s affairs in the High Court of Admiralty and other courts.

In probate and divorce courts, this official acted as the proctor or solicitor representing the Crown. In petitions of divorce, or for declaration of nullity of marriage, the King/Queen&#x27;s Proctor may, under direction of the Attorney General, intervene in the suit for the purpose of arguing any question that the court deems expedient to have argued. The powers are set out in section 8 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, and include the power to show cause against a decree nisi being made absolute, usually on receipt of information indicating that the court has been misled into granting a decree.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the two groups of legal practitioners, advocates (similar to barristers) and Proctors (similar to solicitors) existed since 1833 until the Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, created a single group of practitioners, known as attorneys-at-law. There were two types of proctors; proctors of the Supreme Court and proctors of a district court. The former could practice in any court, while the latter was allowed to practice in the lower courts in a specific district. The Attorney General was authorised a proctor from each district to serve as the Crown Proctor to instruct or brief crown counsel on civil and criminal cases in district courts, courts of requests and police courts on behalf of the Crown.

===Australia===
Proctor is a term that survives in Western Australia and in South Australia. Until it was amended in 1992 and later superseded by the Legal Profession Act in 2008, the Legal Practitioners Act 1893 (WA) provided for legal practitioners in Western Australia to be admitted and entitled to practice as &quot;practitioners&quot;. That term was then defined as &quot;a person admitted and entitled to practice as a barrister, solicitor, attorney, and proctor of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, or in any one or more of these capacities&quot;. Whilst it was theoretically possible to apply for admission in any of these capacities, as there was no separate qualification for such separate admissions, the standard practice (pre-1992) was for all persons to be admitted as barristers, solicitors, and proctors of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. Many survive today. South Australian legislation still provides as of December 2019 that a person admitted as a Solicitor to the Supreme Court of South Australia is also both a Proctor and an Attorney of that court.

===United States===
The American colonies continued the British use of the term proctor in admiralty for attorneys who were admitted to specialized admiralty and patent bars. With the unification of the federal Admiralty Rules with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1966, attorneys practicing admiralty law before the federal courts ceased to be formally called proctors, though the term remains in unofficial use.

==Ecclesiastical==
In the context of the Church of England, a proctor represents clergy in convocation. The Lower Houses of the Convocations of Canterbury and York include &quot;specially elected&quot; proctors (the deans of cathedrals and the Dean of either Jersey or Guernsey) and &quot;directly elected&quot; proctors (representing beneficed and licensed clergy, clergy with permission to officiate, archdeacons, clergy holding office in a cathedral, religious communities, universities and institutions of theological education).

==Education==

===High university official===
In some universities, a proctor is a high official.

====Cambridge University====

The early history of the office at Cambridge is obscure, but it seems that the Proctors have always represented the colleges in University proceedings. In the past the Proctors administered the university&#x27;s finances, acted as examiners for all candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, prosecuted anyone suspected of unfair trading, and had a multitude of other tasks. At present their functions are twofold: (1) taking part in all university ceremonials, and (2) enforcing discipline in the case of members of the university who are &quot;in statu pupillari&quot; (undergraduates, Bachelors of Arts and Bachelors of Laws).

=====Election=====
At Cambridge University the Proctors are nominated every May by colleges identified in a predetermined cycle. They then serve for one year from 1 October, assisted by their Deputy Proctors and two Pro-Proctors. They must have been a member of the Senate for three years, and must have resided two years at the university. The two Pro-Proctors are not, as at Oxford, nominated by the Proctors, but are also elected by the Regent House on the nomination of the colleges, each college having the right to nominate a Pro-Proctor for the year next before that in which it nominates the Proctor (Grace of 26 February 1863). Two additional Pro-Proctors are also elected by the Senate each year, on the nomination of the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors, to assist the latter in the maintenance of discipline (Grace of 6 June 1878).

The Proctors for 2020–2021 are Dr Karen Ottewell (Senior Proctor) of Emmanuel College and Dr Annamaria Motrescu-Mayes (Junior Proctor) of Clare Hall.

The Deputies to the Proctors are Dr Gemma Burgess (Deputy to the Senior Proctor) of St Edmund&#x27;s College and Mr Francis Knights (Deputy to the Junior Proctor) of Fitzwilliam College.

The Pro-Proctors are Dr John Fawcett (Senior Pro-Proctor) of Churchill College and Rev&#x27;d Dr Mark Smith (Junior Pro-Proctor) of Clare College.

Mr Timothy Milner of Darwin College is additional Pro-Proctor for Ceremonial.

Mr Gordon Chesterman of St Edmund&#x27;s College is additional Pro-Proctor (2020–21).

The first hundred years of Proctorial records are mostly lost, but the Proctors&#x27; Office web site has a more or less complete list of the Proctors since 1314.

=====Ceremonial functions=====
The Proctors are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Board of Scrutiny, the Board of Examinations, and various other bodies. Their presence is essential at all Congregations of the Regent House, at which the Senior Proctor reads all the Graces and the Junior Proctor takes the vote of the Regent House. If any Grace is opposed by any member of the Senate saying &quot;non-placet&quot;, the Proctors take the votes of those present and announce the result. Graces are offered not only for making changes in University Statutes and Ordinances and for appointing examiners and the like, but also for granting degrees. When a degree is to be taken, the college of the candidate presents a &quot;supplicat&quot; or petition for the degree; this petition is approved by the Regent House, if and when they have satisfied themselves that the candidate has fulfilled the conditions, and is read at the Congregation by the Senior Proctor: these &quot;supplicats&quot; are practically never opposed, but Graces for new Statutes and Ordinances are frequently opposed, and on very important occasions such as the election of a new Chancellor many hundreds of non-resident members of the Senate come up to record their votes.

=====Disciplinary functions=====
The proctors&#x27; powers as to discipline have a very long history. As far as concerns members of the university they have authority to impose certain fines for minor offences, such as not wearing academic dress on occasions when it is ordered, and also to order a student not to be out of their college after a certain hour for a certain number of days (&quot;gating&quot;). For more serious offences, the proctor generally reports the matter to the authorities of the offender&#x27;s college to be dealt with by them, or as a last resort brings the offender before the university court of discipline, which has power to rusticate or send down (expel). 

The power of the proctors over persons who are not members of the university dates from charters granted by Elizabeth I and James I, which empowered the university authorities to search for undesirable characters, men and women, rogues, vagabonds, and other &quot;personas de male suspectas&quot; (persons suspected of evil), and punish them by imprisonment or banishment. In recent times this power was often exercised with respect to prostitutes. The proctors promenaded the streets attended by their servants who are always sworn in as special constables. These constables, colloquially known as &quot;Bulldogs&quot;, are now members of Cambridge University Constabulary: they retain full police powers of arrest within 5 miles (8 km) of Great St Mary&#x27;s Church, deemed to be the centre of the university (proctors no longer have the power of arrest). 

If occasion arose, the proctors and their constables could arrest a suspected woman and have her taken to the Spinning House (for which Thomas Hobson the carrier had left an endowment). The next day, the woman would be brought before the vice-chancellor, who had power to commit her to the Spinning House; as a general rule the sentence was for no longer than three weeks. For this purpose the Vice-Chancellor sat &quot;in camera&quot; and the jurisdiction had nothing to do with that of the vice-chancellor&#x27;s court. In 1898, attention was called to this procedure by the case of a girl named Daisy Hopkins, who was arrested and committed to the Spinning House. Application was made on her behalf to the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and when the application came on it appeared that there had been a technical irregularity (the prisoner not having been formally charged when brought before the Vice-Chancellor); so the writ was granted and the prisoner released. She afterwards brought an action against the proctor, which failed. It was then decided to abolish the practice of hearing these cases &quot;in camera&quot;. The whole practice was, however, objected to by the authorities of the town, and after a conference an agreement was reached: the proctorial jurisdiction over persons not members of the university was abolished (1904).

Today, the Junior Proctor retains special responsibility for university societies and for resolving disputes arising from the Cambridge Students&#x27; Union. The Special Pro-Proctor for Motor Vehicles is responsible for licensing the keeping and using of motor vehicles (other than mopeds) within of Great St Mary&#x27;s Church by University students who have not yet reached MA status and are in residence in term or in the Long Vacation period of residence. The Motor Proctor also has the power to impose a fine of up to £175 on students breaching the regulations on the keeping and using of motor vehicles.

====Oxford University====
The Proctors of Oxford University are senior officers of the university who are responsible for enforcing University discipline and sanctions, for handling complaints against the university, and for conducting public examinations (often at the Examination Schools). They are elected annually by the colleges. Two Proctors are elected each year: a Senior and a Junior Proctor.

The reform of the university statutes in 2002 reorganised the disciplinary system of the university and reduced the powers of the Proctors. However, they still act as ombudsmen for the university, and handle formal complaints by and against students (although more minor disciplinary matters are usually dealt with by the Dean of each college). They have the power to issue fines to members of the university for numerous offences, including cheating in examinations.

Prior to 2003, the Proctors were aided in disciplinary matters by the Oxford University Police (who wore bowler hats and were generally known as &quot;Bulldogs&quot;); the University Police were a private constabulary with full powers of arrest within the precincts of the university and within four miles (6 km) of any University building. However, after receiving public criticism in 2002 for their exercise of authority over citizens of Oxford who were not members of the university, the force was disbanded by the University Council in 2003, due partly to the excessive expense of complying with new Government requirements on police training and complaints procedures. Today, the Constables have been redesignated as &quot;Proctors&#x27; Officers&quot; and continue to serve under the Proctors, but no longer have the powers of police constables.

===Examination supervisor===

In the United States and some other countries, a proctor can be any teacher or other staff member at a university, secondary school, or even elementary school when they are supervising the administration of a test or examination; i.e., the role referred to as an &quot;invigilator&quot; in British, Canadian, Australian and South African English.

====Online proctoring====
Online proctoring is the monitoring or invigilation of assessments taken remotely.

Online proctors verify test-taker identity and monitor to prevent cheating using a variety of methods, including live, record-and-review, and automated proctoring. Online proctoring services work with colleges, universities, corporations, and other certification providers to offer identity verification services and assessment monitoring.

Demand for online proctoring has expanded in recent years as a result of rapid expansions in online learning. In 2006, the Department of Education waived the so-called “50 percent rule,” which stipulated that U.S. students in online degree programs could only receive federal student aid if half of their programs were campus-based. As of 2017, one in three students take at least one course online during their college career. In addition, instructors in face-to-face classes can also administer exams online.

Higher education institutions around the world make use of online proctoring for tens of thousands of exams. The 17 campuses of the University of North Carolina proctor between 30,000 and 40,000 exams online per year. At the fully online Western Governors University, 30,000 exams are proctored online each month. Recent estimates suggest that there are about fifteen providers of online proctoring.

====Research on online proctoring====
Research suggests that students are equally likely to cheat online as they are in person. However, one study found that nearly three-quarters of college students hold the perception that cheating online is easier than cheating in person. In 2016, USA Today reported on research by Examity which suggests that 6% of students violate rules for proctored online exams.
There is clear evidence to that it is easily possible to circumvent e-proctoring software. A scientific test of the Proctorio software at the Dutch University of Twente showed that the software was not able to detect any of the cases of examination fraud it was subjected to. The conclusion was that the sensitivity of Proctorio is disastrous and should be considered at very close to zero.

Some online proctoring providers give colleges and universities access to anonymized, aggregated data on proctoring and cheating rates. These analytics tools allow institutions to measure their violation rates against other schools, as well as to track incidents by time of year and type of course, among other metrics.

<doc id="691829" wikidata="Q3191413" url="?curid=691829" title="KIRO-TV">
<text>KIRO-TV (channel 7) is a television station in Seattle, Washington, United States, affiliated with CBS and Telemundo. Owned by Cox Media Group, the station maintains studios on Third Avenue in the Belltown section of Downtown Seattle, and its transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Queen Anne neighborhood, adjacent to the station&#x27;s original studios.

KIRO-TV signed on in 1958 as the last commercial VHF television station for the Seattle metropolitan area; owing to its status as the television extension to KIRO (710 AM), the station immediately took the CBS affiliation from Tacoma-licensed KTNT-TV (now KSTW), but they were forced to share the affiliation for two years after the owners of both stations settled a lawsuit over the affiliation switch. Subsequently owned for more than three decades by the broadcasting division of the LDS Church, KIRO-TV briefly became a UPN affiliate when KSTW reaffiliated with CBS in 1995 during a nationwide affiliation shuffle, but rejoined CBS in 1997 via a three-way trade that involved the two stations.

==History==
===Early years===
After KOMO-TV (channel 4) signed on in December 1953, Seattle&#x27;s channel 7 was the last commercial VHF channel allocation available in the Puget Sound area. As such, its construction permit was heavily contested among several local broadcast interests. Three radio stations—KVI (570 AM), KXA (770 AM, now KTTH) and KIRO (710 AM)—were locked in a battle for the frequency over several years of comparative hearings at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Following an initial decision in 1955 and a reaffirmation in 1957, the ultimate victorious party was Queen City Broadcasting, owners of KIRO radio, who signed-on channel 7 on February 8, 1958. Queen City was led by president and general manager Saul Haas, who purchased KIRO radio in 1935 and included U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson and CBS News correspondent Edward R. Murrow amongst its shareholders. The station&#x27;s original studios were located on Queen Anne Avenue, adjacent to its broadcast tower and directly across the street from KIRO radio. The first program shown on channel 7 was the explosion of Ripple Rock, a hazard to navigation in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia.

KIRO radio had been a CBS Radio affiliate for over 20 years and KIRO-TV subsequently became an affiliate of the CBS television network upon signing on. Channel 7 took the CBS affiliation from Tacoma-licensed KTNT-TV (channel 11, now KSTW) prompting that station&#x27;s owners at the time, the &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot; to file an antitrust lawsuit accusing CBS of having a standing agreement with KIRO to affiliate with the television network before Queen City&#x27;s permit to build channel 7 was even approved. In May 1960, KIRO-TV was forced to share CBS with KTNT-TV as part of a settlement reached between the three parties. This arrangement lasted for the next two years with KIRO-TV again becoming the market&#x27;s exclusive CBS affiliate in September 1962.

====Sale to LDS Church====
In April 1963, the Deseret News Publishing Company, the for-profit media arm of the Salt Lake City–based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), began purchasing stock in Queen City Broadcasting starting with a 10 percent share from several minority partners including Sen. Magnuson. Six months later the LDS Church purchased an additional 50 percent, giving them majority control of the KIRO stations. Along with having earned a handsome return on his original investment of 28 years earlier, Saul Hass subsequently joined the board of the LDS Church&#x27;s broadcasting subsidiary, which was renamed Bonneville International in 1964.

Soon after the FCC approved the sale, Bonneville executives Lloyd Cooney and Kenneth L. Hatch arrived in Seattle to lead the renamed KIRO, Inc. division. Upon Cooney&#x27;s departure to run for U.S. Senate in 1980, Hatch became president, CEO and chairman, positions he held until 1995. Under Hatch&#x27;s leadership, KIRO, Inc. (which, in addition to KIRO-AM-FM-TV, would later include KING radio and Third Avenue Productions) became one of the nation&#x27;s premier regional broadcast groups. KIRO&#x27;s corporate board included many notable leaders including Mary Maxwell (mother of Bill Gates); Pay &#x27;n Save chairman M. Lamont Bean; Washington Mutual chief executive officer Tony Eyring and Gordon B. Hinckley, a future president of the LDS Church. The KIRO stations moved their offices and studios to &quot;Broadcast House&quot; at Third Avenue and Broad Street in Seattle&#x27;s Belltown district in 1968, where KIRO-TV remains to this day.

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, KIRO-TV still faced competition in some parts of Western Washington from Bellingham-based KVOS-TV (channel 12), which was also then a CBS affiliate. After years of legal challenges and negotiations with CBS and KIRO-TV, KVOS (at the time owned by Wometco Enterprises) began to phase out most CBS programming by 1980. At age 29 in 1979, John Lippman joined KIRO-TV as news director, and he worked there until 1992. During that time, KIRO staff grew increased from 45 to 100, and KIRO-TV was at or near the top of the ratings in the Seattle market for most of the decade.

KVOS retained a nominal affiliation with CBS until 1987 (KVOS gradually became an independent, and is now a Univision affiliate), during which it would run any CBS network programs that were preempted by channel 7.

===From CBS to UPN===
In 1994, CBS found itself without an affiliate in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex after KDFW-TV left the network to become a Fox affiliate as a result of the station&#x27;s owner, New World Communications, signing an affiliation deal with Fox (it later was purchased outright by the network). Consequently, CBS began to negotiate with Gaylord Broadcasting to secure an affiliation agreement with the independent station it had long owned in Fort Worth, KTVT. As part of the deal, CBS would also affiliate with Gaylord-owned independent KSTW in Tacoma; both KSTW and KTVT had been scheduled to affiliate with The WB Television Network (the network would instead pair up with KTZZ-TV [now KZJO] and KDAF, respectively). The deal was announced on September 15, 1994, and CBS programs that had been preempted by KIRO-TV (such as &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;) moved to KSTW soon afterward. Other CBS programs such as &quot;The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder&quot; were shown on KSTW beginning in January 1995, although the show aired an hour later at 1:35 a.m., whereas other CBS affiliates aired the program directly after the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; at 12:35 a.m. Even when channel 11 regained the CBS affiliation for the third time in its history in March 1995, the program continued to air at 1:35 a.m.

Two days before the affiliation switch was announced, Bonneville announced that it would sell KIRO-TV to the Belo Corporation, while retaining ownership of KIRO radio. In addition, in anticipation of the affiliation change, Belo stated that it would run channel 7 as a news-intensive independent station. However, on December 6, the station reached an affiliation deal with another then-forthcoming network, UPN.

More changes descended upon channel 7 after Belo took control of the station on January 31, 1995. The station began carrying UPN programming upon its startup on January 16, 1995; however, until CBS moved completely to KSTW on March 13 of that year, UPN programs generally aired on weekend afternoons, though KIRO-TV did preempt CBS programming so that it could air the series premiere of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in prime time.

Local newscasts on channel 7 expanded during this time to nearly 40 hours each week with expansions to its morning and early evening newscasts to compensate for UPN not having national news programs. Outside of UPN&#x27;s program offerings, the rest of KIRO-TV&#x27;s schedule was filled with first-run syndicated talk shows, reality shows, off-network dramas, a couple of off-network sitcoms and movies. This format was unusual for a UPN affiliate (but was becoming standard for a Fox affiliate) as most UPN affiliates had a general entertainment format outside of network programming hours. In 1996, Belo acquired the Providence Journal Company, which owned Seattle&#x27;s NBC affiliate KING-TV (channel 5). Belo could not own both KING-TV and KIRO-TV under FCC rules at the time, and as a result, the company opted to sell KIRO-TV.

===Rejoining CBS===
Though there was speculation that Belo would swap KIRO-TV to Fox Television Stations in exchange for KSAZ-TV in Phoenix and KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas, Belo announced on February 20, 1997, that it would swap channel 7 to UPN co-owner Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Stations Group subsidiary (now part of CBS News and Stations), in exchange for KMOV in St. Louis. At the time, Paramount Stations Group was in the process of selling off the CBS and NBC affiliates that it inherited from Viacom through its 1994 purchase of Paramount Pictures.

Concurrently, Paramount/Viacom traded KIRO-TV to Cox Enterprises in exchange for KSTW, just one month after Cox announced it would acquire that station from Gaylord Broadcasting. The trades were completed on June 2, 1997. The two stations retained their respective syndicated programming, but swapped network affiliations once again—with KSTW becoming a UPN owned-and-operated station, and KIRO-TV regaining its CBS affiliation on June 30, 1997.

In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations. The sale gave KIRO-TV in-state sisters in Spokane&#x27;s KAYU-TV, the Tri-Cities&#x27; KFFX-TV, and Yakima&#x27;s KCYU-LD—all of which are Fox affiliates. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019. The Fox stations were sold off to Imagicomm Communications in August 2022.

==Programming==
===Past programming===

One of the most famous and longest-running regional children&#x27;s television programs in the United States, &quot;The J.P. Patches Show&quot; was produced in-house by KIRO-TV and broadcast steadily from 1958 to 1981. The program starred Chris Wedes as Julius Pierpont Patches, a shabby clown and self-professed mayor of the City Dump and Bob Newman as J.P.&#x27;s &quot;girlfriend&quot; Gertrude, in addition to a number of other characters. &quot;Nightmare Theatre&quot; was KIRO-TV&#x27;s weekly horror movie series, seen from 1964 to 1978 and hosted by &quot;The Count&quot; (Joe Towey) from 1968 to 1975. Towey, who also directed &quot;The J.P. Patches Show&quot;, died in 1989.

During the 1970s, KIRO-TV preempted the first half hour of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; each morning in order to air &quot;J.P. Patches&quot;. Many parents protested by writing letters to the station because they preferred more educational value from &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; than with &quot;J.P.&quot;, while children preferred &quot;J.P. Patches&quot;. From 1987 to 1995, under Bonneville ownership, KIRO-TV refused to air &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which normally aired at 12:30 p.m.; the station aired a 60-minute local newscast from 12 noon to 1 p.m. instead. As a result, the station received many protest letters from fans of the show during that period and even one from the show&#x27;s creator himself, William J. Bell. The show was cleared when KSTW had CBS for their brief time from 1995 to 1997, and was eventually cleared on KIRO-TV after they went back to CBS from UPN and a change of ownership to Cox. In 2014, KIRO-TV once again went back to an hour of local news at noon, delaying &quot;B&amp;B&quot; to 3 p.m., and later 2 p.m. when &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; moved to 9 a.m. On September 10, 2018, KIRO-TV went back to an hour of news at noon. &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; stayed at 2 p.m., with &quot;Right This Minute&quot; moving to 2:30 p.m.

In 1990, KIRO-TV tape-delayed the Daytona 500 by six hours to show a Seattle SuperSonics game as it was the flagship station of the team. The race was won by Derrike Cope (who is a native of nearby Spanaway, Washington) in an upset over Dale Earnhardt in the final lap after a cut tire. Prior to joining UPN in 1995, KIRO-TV ran the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; at 6 p.m. between local newscasts at 5 and 6:30 p.m. (The program now airs at 6:30 p.m., the recommended Pacific Time Zone slot for the newscast.)

===Sports programming===
KIRO-TV was also the flagship station for pre-season game broadcasts of the Seattle Seahawks from 1976 to 1980. Play-by-play announcers were Gary Justice (1976–78) and Wayne Cody (1979–85), who was also the station&#x27;s sports anchor. For years, KIRO-TV was the flagship station for Seattle SuperSonics broadcasts, coinciding with the NBA&#x27;s broadcast contract with CBS that it held from 1973 to 1990, which included the SuperSonics&#x27; winning the 1979 NBA Finals. KIRO-TV also carried the Seattle Mariners from 1986 to 1988 as well as in 1992 and again from 1995 to 2000, in addition to any games aired through CBS&#x27; MLB contract from 1990 to 1993. KIRO-TV carried the Tacoma Stars (MISL) from 1986 to 1988.

The station also airs Seahawks games (at least two each season) when the team hosts an AFC team at Lumen Field, via the NFL on CBS (it was previously the station where the majority of the team&#x27;s games aired in 1976 and again from 1998 to 2001), and beginning in 2014, with the institution of the new &quot;cross-flex&quot; broadcast rule, any games in which they play another NFC team (or an AFC team on the road) that are moved from Fox (KCPQ) to CBS.

KIRO-TV had also broadcast the Albert Lee Appliance Cup H1 Unlimited hydroplane races on the culminating day of Seattle&#x27;s Seafair festival. The rights also include coverage of other Seafair events, including Seattle&#x27;s Fourth of July fireworks on Lake Union (which were brought under the auspices of Seafair in 2013), as well as the Torchlight Parade. In 2017, full-day coverage of the races were discontinued, marking the first time since 1951 that the races were not broadcast live, and the end of a 31-year run of live broadcasts on the station. KIRO cited the costs of producing the telecast as reasoning, and replaced the live broadcast with a 90-minute recap show aired in the evening. However, full-day coverage of all Seafair races returned via Tegna-owned KONG-TV (sister station to KING-TV) in 2018 in association with SWX Right Now.

===News operation===
KIRO-TV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).

In 1969, KIRO-TV made major upgrades to its news programming, implementing the now-commonplace &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format with chief correspondent Clif Kirk, sportscaster Ron Forsell and assistant anchor Sandy Hill, who later left KIRO-TV to become a co-host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, KIRO-TV was known in Seattle for hiring women in the roles of &quot;assistant anchors&quot; and &quot;weather presenters&quot;, including Sandy Hill, Ann Martin, Mikki Flowers and Ann Busch. Throughout the decades, KIRO-TV placed a high emphasis on news programming and investigative stories. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; team of anchors John Marler and Gary Justice, meteorologist Harry Wappler and Wayne Cody (and later joined by Susan Hutchison) overtook KING-TV for supremacy in local news.

Beginning in the 1970s, KIRO-TV&#x27;s newscasts also included op-ed segments prepared by Lloyd R. Cooney. After Cooney left the station in 1980 to pursue an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign, the station editorials were handled by a series of commentators: KIRO, Inc. CEO and chairman Ken Hatch, followed by former Seattle City Council member John Miller (later elected as Congressman from Washington&#x27;s First District) and then by former &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; editor Louis R. Guzzo. In 1986, KIRO-TV debuted &quot;Point Counterpoint&quot; featuring conservative John Carlson and liberal Walt Crowley; the segment aired on what was then KIRO-TV&#x27;s most popular newscast, &quot;The Sunday Newshour&quot; with Crowley and Carlson becoming well known for their pointed and bombastic debates.

In 1990, KIRO-TV became one of the first television stations in the United States (if not &quot;the&quot; first) to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30 a.m. timeslot—long before it started to become commonplace nationwide in the late 2000s and 2010s (at the time, most news-producing stations started their morning news programs at 6 or 6:30 a.m., with many not expanding into earlier timeslots until as early as the mid-1990s); the program eventually reverted to a 5:30 a.m. start by 1993. Also during this time period, KIRO began producing a 10 p.m. newscast for local independent station KTZZ (currently KZJO); a simulcast of KIRO radio&#x27;s morning drive program was added to KTZZ in 1993. The 10 p.m. newscast was dropped in September 1993.

By the early 1990s, the well-worn, &quot;happy talk&quot; format faltered and KING-TV&#x27;s newscasts had overtaken KIRO-TV in the local news ratings, leading to a major restructuring of its news department. In June 1992, the station merged its news department with that of KIRO radio, under its news director Andy Ludlum. Seeking to differentiate itself from its competitors, station president Ken Hatch oversaw a major revamp of KIRO-TV&#x27;s newscasts that launched on February 4, 1993, which the station billed as &quot;news outside of the box&quot;. Robert Bovill designed an open newsroom set, which synergized the radio and television staff as the &quot;KIRO News Network&quot;, and included a rotating, three-section platform for studio interviews, with walls meant to resemble Mount Rainier; the &quot;command center&quot; in the center of the area contained a nine-screen video wall, and an assignment desk designed to resemble a ferryboat. The Seattle Symphony recorded new theme music, and Pacific Northwest Ballet co-artistic director Kent Stowell coached the anchors in the art of walking toward a moving camera while simultaneously delivering the news.

The result was an unmitigated disaster; viewers quickly complained they were distracted by the moving anchors, the constant buzz of assignment editors in the background of newscasts and periodic &quot;visits&quot; into the KIRO radio studios. The television reporters&#x27; primary assets were lost on radio listeners, while many of the radio reporters were clearly uncomfortable on camera. The original concept also called for live airing of raw, unedited field tape, which only called attention to the importance of proper news editing. In addition, KOMO-TV and KING-TV were fighting for first place in the Seattle market; the latter station&#x27;s local sketch comedy show, &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, took potshots at KIRO&#x27;s news format the week of the debut. Even KIRO&#x27;s own employees were not enthused about it; one unidentified reporter was quoted as saying &quot;All of this is being done for cosmetics. It&#x27;s all superficial garbage. There&#x27;s been no effort to improve substance. But it&#x27;s like the emperor&#x27;s new clothes: You can&#x27;t question it.&quot; Attempts were made to salvage the format, including using tighter camera angles.

By September 1993, after veteran anchor Susan Hutchison threatened to leave the station, Ludlum and other backers of the idea had either left or been fired. Under new news director Bill Lord, the station returned to a more conventional format as &quot;KIRO NewsChannel 7&quot;; his colleagues applauded a promise to &quot;nail the anchors&#x27; shoes to the floor&quot;. The station ultimately returned to &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; (with a new graphics set and logo based on sister station WHIO-TV in Dayton, Ohio) when Cox purchased the station and concurrent to its return to CBS in 1997. During the station&#x27;s UPN affiliation, the station launched additional newscasts to replace CBS programming in time periods not programmed by UPN, including a two-hour morning newscast extension from 7 to 9 a.m. and an hour of news at 10 p.m. Beginning in March 2003, the station would once again produce a 10 p.m. newscast for another station, this time for KSTW (whose own news department had been shuttered in 1998, shortly after the affiliation swap between KSTW and KIRO had been reversed); the newscast was canceled on December 19, 2003, and returned on June 28, 2004, before being canceled permanently in June 2005; news would not return to KSTW until 2022. On October 3, 2015, KIRO-TV introduced a new set, refreshed logo, and dropped the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; title again, this time in favor of &quot;KIRO 7 News&quot;.

<text>Stephen Paul David Morris (born 28 October 1957) is an English drummer who has worked with the rock band New Order and, previously, Joy Division. He also wrote and performed in The Other Two, a band consisting of Morris and his girlfriend and later wife, Gillian Gilbert. Morris also participated in the New Order spin-off band Bad Lieutenant. He and frontman Bernard Sumner are the only two continuous members of New Order, and appeared on every band’s albums.

==Career==
Stephen Paul David Morris was born on 28 October 1957, in Macclesfield, Cheshire. His father was a travelling salesman who also put on dances. His uncle was a musician. When Morris told his father he wanted to be a drummer, he replied: &quot;Drummers, Stephen. I’ve never met a sane one yet... They all end up taking morphine and drinking absinthe, rotting their brains. You don’t want to end up like that, do you?&quot;
He attended the King&#x27;s School, Macclesfield, as did Joy Division singer Ian Curtis. After Joy Division (then called Warsaw) tried three other drummers, they eventually recruited Morris, who responded to a wanted ad posted in a local music shop.

Morris is noted for his &quot;machine-like&quot; skills as a drummer, which he credits to krautrock influences, naming Klaus Dinger of Neu! as an important influence.

Drummers he also named as musical inspiration, were Jaki Liebezeit of Can and Moe Tucker of the Velvet Underground because they &quot;were the ones who kept it simple&quot;. He also cited John French as an influence. From 1977, he was influenced by the music of Siouxsie and the Banshees because their &quot;drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms&quot;; &quot;hearing the sessions they&#x27;d done on John Peel&#x27;s show and reading gig write-ups&quot;, [...] inspired him. 

During Joy Division recording sessions with Martin Hannett, Morris was asked to record his parts one drum at a time so that Hannett could have complete control over the production. He also took an early interest in drum machines, combining them with traditional drumming on many Joy Division and New Order releases. Although he is primarily a percussionist, Morris also plays keyboards and synthesizer.

Early on, Morris was a contender to become New Order&#x27;s lead vocalist, and his vocals can be heard on some early live tracks. He also contributed musically to as-yet-unreleased demos by Quando Quango and produced a number of acts with Gilbert for Factory, such as the duo Red Turns To..., under New Order&#x27;s Be Music production tag. He played drums for Echo &amp; the Bunnymen on their rendition of the Doors&#x27; &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;, which they recorded at Amazon Studios in Liverpool in 1986.

During a break from New Order, Morris and Gilbert formed the side project The Other Two; together they have released two albums as well as various remixes and soundtrack work. 

In 2007, Morris and Gilbert remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remix album &quot;Year Zero Remixed&quot;. In June 2009, during New Order&#x27;s second break-up, band members Bernard Sumner and Phil Cunningham, along with Jake Evans, formed a new band called Bad Lieutenant. Morris recorded drums on several songs with the band, and joined their line-up for live gigs. Bad Lieutenant released their debut album &quot;Never Cry Another Tear&quot; in 2009 and toured from October 2009 to April 2010. They began work on a second album, but are presently on hiatus.

New Order reformed with a new line-up in September 2011, and Morris returned to playing with New Order.

In 2019, the book &quot;Record Play Pause&quot;, the first volume of his &quot;Confessions of a Post-Punk Percussionist&quot;, was published by Constable and later by Little, Brown and Company. 

On 2020 the second volume, &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, was published by Little, Brown and Company. In 2021 Morris contributed to an interview reflecting on the previous 10 years of New Order 

==Personal life==
In 1979, Morris was questioned about the Yorkshire Ripper case. Joy Division&#x27;s touring schedule happened to be similar to Peter Sutcliffe&#x27;s movements which led to the police&#x27;s suspicion. Following gigs in Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds and Manchester, both Morris and bass player Peter Hook were questioned.

Morris married fellow New Order member Gillian Gilbert in 1994. The couple live in Rainow, Cheshire, and have two daughters.

He is a science fiction fan, particularly of the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He has a full-sized Dalek replica in his rehearsal room, which Sumner has called &quot;the sixth member&quot; of New Order. He also owns several military vehicles including a Mark IV Ferret armoured reconnaissance vehicle and several tanks.

<doc id="691836" wikidata="Q7177097" url="?curid=691836" title="Peter Steinbrueck">
<text>Peter Steinbrueck (born October 14, 1957) is an American architect and politician from Seattle, Washington. He is the principal and founder of Steinbrueck Urban Strategies and was a member of the Seattle City Council from 1997 to 2008. He also was a Seattle Port Commissioner from 2018 to 2022.

==Early life and education==
Steinbrueck was born and raised in Seattle and is the son of noted architect Victor Steinbrueck (1911–1985) and artist Elaine Pearl Worden. His parents divorced when he was young and he would live with his mother but spend time with his dad at protests to save Pike Place Market. He graduated from Lakeside School, received his bachelor of arts degree in government from Bowdoin College, and a master of architecture degree from the University of Washington College of Built Environments.

In the 1980s and &#x27;90s, Steinbrueck was a civil activist as a leading advocate and author of the Citizens Alternative Plan, focusing on limiting downtown building heights. The CAP campaign was partially fueled by the failure to preserve Westlake Park as open space, which was supported by his father Victor before he died in 1984.The CAP initiative came to the city for a vote and passed with 62% support, but the council put some restrictions on the initiative to protect it from court challenges.

==Political career==
===Seattle city council===
Steinbrueck was a Seattle City Council member, first elected to the council on November 4, 1997, and immediately sworn in to fill the unfinished term of John Manning. He ran for re-election in 1999 and 2003 winning both elections with 80% of the vote. He served as chair of the Housing and Human Services Committee in his first four years on the council, later the Parks, Education, and Libraries Committee, and in his final four years, he chaired the Urban Development and Planning Committee, served as council president from 2002 to 2003.

Over his tenure, Steinbrueck led legislation that focused on early education, the environment, homeless services, housing, and historic preservation. On the environment, he developed legislation creating the nation&#x27;s first law requiring a LEED Silver rating for public buildings and separate legislation protecting the Cedar River watershed. He also used his experience as an architect in the design and development of public buildings, such as Seattle City Hall and the Seattle Central Library. He also passed legislation that restored funding for homelessness services, funded creation of low-income housing, and double fees on downtown developers for an affordable housing fund.

In 2007, Steinbrueck announced that he would not seek reelection.

===Mayoral election===

In late 2012, Steinbrueck announced his candidacy for Mayor of Seattle in the 2013 election. He focused his campaign on public safety, with more police in parks with high crime and other police reform, and on infrastructure and urban planning. In the August primary election, Steinbrueck came in third with 16% of the vote and did not advance to the general election.

===Port of Seattle commissioner===
On November 7, 2017, Steinbrueck was elected as Seattle Port Commissioner, Position 4.

Steinbrueck served one term on the Port of Seattle Commission beginning in 2018, where he is credited with creating the Port&#x27;s $20 million South King County Community Fund. Steinbrueck authored a motion passed by the full Commission developing a task force on Policing and Civil Rights that examined Port Police hiring, training, promotions, and the use of force. Steinbrueck was President of the Commission during the Port&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and successfully lead the organization to financial stability without staff layoffs as Port revenues reduced dramatically with flight cancelations and the cancelation of the cruise season.

In 2021, Steinbrueck ran for reelection and lost to Toshiko Grace Hasegawa, the executive director of the Washington State Commission on Asian-Pacific American Affairs, 45% to 54%.

==Urbanist activities==
In 2007, after leaving his City Council position, Steinbrueck founded his firm, Steinbrueck Urban Strategies, an urban planning, urban sustainability, and urban design consulting practice. He has been a visiting instructor at the University of Washington’s College of the Built Environments and is a frequent speaker, commentator, and writer on the emerging framework for advancing the environmental sustainability of cities and regions. In 2009, Steinbrueck was named a Loeb Fellow in the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University, where he completed the academic year 2009-10 of independent research focused on the environment, climate change, and urban sustainability in the United States. Steinbrueck is a Harvard Center for the Environment&#x27;s Working Group for Sustainable Cities member.

==Awards and recognition==

The American Institute of Architects (AIA) recognized Steinbrueck with its Young Architects Award in 1999 for his public and civic contributions affecting affordable housing, homelessness, civic design, historic preservation, and the environment. In 2006, the AIA elevated him to membership in its College of Fellows for his achievements in public office and contributions to the profession and society. In 2002, Steinbrueck received the Public Sector Achievement Award from the National Alliance to End Homelessness for his commitment to reducing and preventing homelessness through systematic change. In 2012, Steinbrueck received the U.S. Federal Executives Board&#x27;s Outstanding Public Service Award.

Other local, state, and national organizations that have honored him include th Seattle Human Services Coalition (Stewardship Award, 2006), &quot;Seattle magazine&#x27;s&quot; Most Influential People (2006), and the Washington State Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (Outstanding Career Achievement in Historic Preservation, 2008).

<text>The Unruh effect (also known as the Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect) is a theoretical prediction in quantum field theory that an observer who is uniformly accelerating through empty space will perceive a thermal bath. This means that even in the absence of any external heat sources, an accelerating observer will detect particles and experience a temperature. In contrast, an inertial observer in the same region of spacetime would observe no temperature.

In other words, the background appears to be warm from an accelerating reference frame. In layman&#x27;s terms, an accelerating thermometer in empty space (like one being waved around), without any other contribution to its temperature, will record a non-zero temperature, just from its acceleration. Heuristically, for a uniformly accelerating observer, the ground state of an inertial observer is seen as a mixed state in thermodynamic equilibrium with a non-zero temperature bath.

The Unruh effect was first described by Stephen Fulling in 1973, Paul Davies in 1975 and W. G. Unruh in 1976. It is currently not clear whether the Unruh effect has actually been observed, since the claimed observations are disputed. There is also some doubt about whether the Unruh effect implies the existence of Unruh radiation.

== Temperature equation ==
The Unruh temperature, sometimes called the Davies–Unruh temperature, was derived separately by Paul Davies and William Unruh and is the effective temperature experienced by a uniformly accelerating detector in a vacuum field. It is given by
:formula_1

where is the reduced Planck constant, is the proper uniform acceleration, is the speed of light, and is the Boltzmann constant. Thus, for example, a proper acceleration of corresponds approximately to a temperature of . Conversely, an acceleration of corresponds to a temperature of .

The Unruh temperature has the same form as the Hawking temperature with denoting the surface gravity of a black hole, which was derived by Stephen Hawking in 1974. In the light of the equivalence principle, it is, therefore, sometimes called the Hawking–Unruh temperature.

Solving the Unruh temperature for the uniform acceleration, it can be expressed as
:formula_2,
where formula_3 is Planck acceleration and formula_4 is Planck temperature.

== Explanation ==
Unruh demonstrated theoretically that the notion of vacuum depends on the path of the observer through spacetime. From the viewpoint of the accelerating observer, the vacuum of the inertial observer will look like a state containing many particles in thermal equilibrium—a warm gas.

The Unruh effect would only appear to an accelerating observer. And although the Unruh effect would initially be perceived as counter-intuitive, it makes sense if the word &quot;vacuum&quot; is interpreted in the following specific way. In quantum field theory, the concept of &quot;vacuum&quot; is not the same as &quot;empty space&quot;: Space is filled with the quantized fields that make up the universe. Vacuum is simply the lowest &quot;possible&quot; energy state of these fields.

The energy states of any quantized field are defined by the Hamiltonian, based on local conditions, including the time coordinate. According to special relativity, two observers moving relative to each other must use different time coordinates. If those observers are accelerating, there may be no shared coordinate system. Hence, the observers will see different quantum states and thus different vacua.

In some cases, the vacuum of one observer is not even in the space of quantum states of the other. In technical terms, this comes about because the two vacua lead to unitarily inequivalent representations of the quantum field canonical commutation relations. This is because two mutually accelerating observers may not be able to find a globally defined coordinate transformation relating their coordinate choices.

An accelerating observer will perceive an apparent event horizon forming (see Rindler spacetime). The existence of Unruh radiation could be linked to this apparent event horizon, putting it in the same conceptual framework as Hawking radiation. On the other hand, the theory of the Unruh effect explains that the definition of what constitutes a &quot;particle&quot; depends on the state of motion of the observer.

The free field needs to be decomposed into positive and negative frequency components before defining the creation and annihilation operators. This can only be done in spacetimes with a timelike Killing vector field. This decomposition happens to be different in Cartesian and Rindler coordinates (although the two are related by a Bogoliubov transformation). This explains why the &quot;particle numbers&quot;, which are defined in terms of the creation and annihilation operators, are different in both coordinates.

The Rindler spacetime has a horizon, and locally any non-extremal black hole horizon is Rindler. So the Rindler spacetime gives the local properties of black holes and cosmological horizons. It is possible to rearrange the metric restricted to these regions to obtain the Rindler metric. The Unruh effect would then be the near-horizon form of Hawking radiation.

The Unruh effect is also expected to be present in de Sitter space.

It is worth stressing that the Unruh effect only says that, according to uniformly-accelerated observers, the vacuum state is a thermal state specified by its temperature, and one should resist reading too much into the thermal state or bath. Different thermal states or baths at the same temperature need not be equal, for they depend on the Hamiltonian describing the system. In particular, the thermal bath seen by accelerated observers in the vacuum state of a quantum field is not the same as a thermal state of the same field at the same temperature according to inertial observers. Furthermore, uniformly accelerated observers, static with respect to each other, can have different proper accelerations (depending on their separation), which is a direct consequence of relativistic red-shift effects. This makes the Unruh temperature spatially inhomogeneous across the uniformly accelerated frame.

== Calculations ==
In special relativity, an observer moving with uniform proper acceleration through Minkowski spacetime is conveniently described with Rindler coordinates, which are related to the standard (Cartesian) Minkowski coordinates by

: formula_5

The line element in Rindler coordinates, i.e. Rindler space is

: formula_6

where , and where is related to the observer&#x27;s proper time by (here ).

An observer moving with fixed traces out a hyperbola in Minkowski space, therefore this type of motion is called hyperbolic motion. The coordinate formula_7 is related to the Schwarzschild spherical coordinate formula_8 by the relation 
:formula_9

An observer moving along a path of constant is uniformly accelerating, and is coupled to field modes which have a definite steady frequency as a function of . These modes are constantly Doppler shifted relative to ordinary Minkowski time as the detector accelerates, and they change in frequency by enormous factors, even after only a short proper time.

Translation in is a symmetry of Minkowski space: it can be shown that it corresponds to a boost in &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot; coordinate around the origin. Any time translation in quantum mechanics is generated by the Hamiltonian operator. For a detector coupled to modes with a definite frequency in , we can treat as &quot;time&quot; and the boost operator is then the corresponding Hamiltonian. In Euclidean field theory, where the minus sign in front of the time in the Rindler metric is changed to a plus sign by multiplying formula_10 to the Rindler time, i.e. a Wick rotation or imaginary time, the Rindler metric is turned into a polar-coordinate-like metric. Therefore any rotations must close themselves after 2 in a Euclidean metric to avoid being singular. So

: formula_11

A path integral with real time coordinate is dual to a thermal partition function, related by a Wick rotation. The periodicity formula_12 of imaginary time corresponds to a temperature of formula_13 in thermal quantum field theory. Note that the path integral for this Hamiltonian is closed with period 2. This means that the modes are thermally occupied with temperature . This is not an actual temperature, because is dimensionless. It is conjugate to the timelike polar angle , which is also dimensionless. To restore the length dimension, note that a mode of fixed frequency in at position has a frequency which is determined by the square root of the (absolute value of the) metric at , the redshift factor. This can be seen by transforming the time coordinate of a Rindler observer at fixed to an inertial, co-moving observer observing a proper time. From the Rindler-line-element given above, this is just . The actual inverse temperature at this point is therefore

: formula_14

It can be shown that the acceleration of a trajectory at constant in Rindler coordinates is equal to , so the actual inverse temperature observed is

:formula_15

Restoring units yields

: formula_16

The temperature of the vacuum, seen by an isolated observer accelerating at the Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration of = , is only . For an experimental test of the Unruh effect it is planned to use accelerations up to , which would give a temperature of about .

The Rindler derivation of the Unruh effect is unsatisfactory to some, since the detector&#x27;s path is super-deterministic. Unruh later developed the Unruh–DeWitt particle detector model to circumvent this objection.

== Other implications ==
The Unruh effect would also cause the decay rate of accelerating particles to differ from inertial particles. Stable particles like the electron could have nonzero transition rates to higher mass states when accelerating at a high enough rate.

== Unruh radiation ==
Although Unruh&#x27;s prediction that an accelerating detector would see a thermal bath is not controversial, the interpretation of the transitions in the detector in the non-accelerating frame is. It is widely, although not universally, believed that each transition in the detector is accompanied by the emission of a particle, and that this particle will propagate to infinity and be seen as Unruh radiation.

The existence of Unruh radiation is not universally accepted. Smolyaninov claims that it has already been observed, while O&#x27;Connell and Ford claim that it is not emitted at all. While these skeptics accept that an accelerating object thermalizes at the Unruh temperature, they do not believe that this leads to the emission of photons, arguing that the emission and absorption rates of the accelerating particle are balanced.

== Experimental observation ==
Researchers claim experiments that successfully detected the Sokolov–Ternov effect may also detect the Unruh effect under certain conditions.

Theoretical work in 2011 suggests that accelerating detectors could be used for the direct detection of the Unruh effect with current technology.

The Unruh effect may have been observed for the first time in 2019 in the high energy channeling radiation explored by the NA63 experiment at CERN.

<text>William George Unruh (; born August 28, 1945) is a Canadian physicist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver who described the hypothetical Unruh effect in 1976.

==Early life and education==
Unruh was born into a Mennonite family in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His parents were Benjamin Unruh, a refugee from Russia, and Anna Janzen, who was born in Canada. He obtained his B.Sc. from the University of Manitoba in 1967, followed by an M.A. (1969) and Ph.D. (1971) from Princeton University, New Jersey, under the direction of John Archibald Wheeler.

==Areas of research==
Unruh has made seminal contributions to our understanding of gravity, black holes, cosmology, and quantum fields in curved spaces, including the discovery of what is now known as the Unruh effect. Unruh has contributed to the foundations of quantum mechanics in areas such as decoherence and the question of time in quantum mechanics. He has helped to clarify the meaning of nonlocality in a quantum context, in particular that quantum nonlocality does not follow from Bell&#x27;s theorem and that ultimately quantum mechanics is a local theory. Unruh is also one of the main critics of the Afshar experiment.

Unruh is also interested in music and teaches the Physics of Music.

===Unruh effect===

The Unruh effect, described by Unruh in 1976, is the prediction that an accelerating observer will observe black-body radiation where an inertial observer would observe none. In other words, the accelerating observer will find itself in a warm background, the temperature of which is proportional to the acceleration. The same quantum state of a field, which is taken to be the ground state for observers in inertial systems, is seen as a thermal state for the uniformly accelerated observer. The Unruh effect therefore means that the very notion of the quantum vacuum depends on the path of the observer through spacetime.

The Unruh effect can be expressed in a simple equation giving the equivalent energy &quot;kT&quot; of a uniformly accelerating particle (with &quot;a&quot; being the constant acceleration), as:

<text>Edmund (&quot;Ted&quot;) John Bowen FRS (29 April 1898 – 19 November 1980) was a British physical chemist.

==Early life and wartime career==
E. J. Bowen was the eldest of four born to Edmund Riley Bowen and Lilias Bowen (née Kamester) in 1898 in Worcester, England. He attended the Royal Grammar School Worcester.

He won the Brackenbury Scholarship in 1915 to the University of Oxford where he studied chemistry. In 1916, after less than a year of his undergraduate course, he volunteered for training as a gunner officer and served as Second Lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery during World War I. After being demobilised in 1919, he returned to Balliol College.

==Research career==
In 1922, Bowen became a Fellow in Chemistry of University College, Oxford, succeeding R. B. Bourdillon, who was briefly Fellow in Chemistry at the College from 1919 to 1921, but who subsequently changed his field of interest from chemistry to medicine. Bowen also served as Domestic Bursar of University College and as Junior Proctor of Oxford University in 1936.

Created a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1935 for his research into fluorescence, he was awarded the Davy Medal in 1963. He wrote a seminal book called &quot;The Chemical Aspects of Light&quot;. He was Vice-President of the Faraday Society and of the Chemical Society.

Much of Bowen&#x27;s research work was carried out at the Balliol-Trinity Laboratories in Oxford. He was an accomplished glass blower for his chemical apparatus and even produced artworks in glass. His 1966 Liversidge Lecture on Fluorescence was based on his life&#x27;s research. After retirement in June 1965, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of University College on 6 October 1965. He was one of the longest serving Fellows of that college (43 years as an ordinary Fellow and a total of 59 years). There is a room in the college named after him. He was also a prominent Worcester Old Elizabethan serving on its Committee for many years and organising the Oxford branch of that club.

During May 1931, Bowen, then a University don, attended a series of three lectures given by Albert Einstein at Rhodes House in Oxford. After the second lecture on 16 May, he helped rescue the blackboard used by Einstein; Sir Francis Wylie (Warden of Rhodes House) formally presented it to the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford where it remains on prominent display to this day.

As well as chemistry, Bowen also had an interest in geology, especially around Ringstead Bay on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset on the south coast of England. &quot;Perisphinctes boweni&quot;, an ammonite from the Jurassic period, is named after him. Bowen was involved with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and produced a scale model of the sun, earth, and moon, for the upper galleries in the museum.

==Later life and death==
Bowen lived for most of his working life in Park Town and is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, north of Oxford. Bowen was married to Edith née Moule and they had a son (also a chemist) and a daughter. He died on 19 November 1980 after a short illness.

==Bowen room==

The room at University College that Bowen used was subsequently named the &#x27;Bowen room&#x27;. It was used by Emeritus Fellows of the college and later occupied by Prof. Ruth Chang. Bowen&#x27;s papers (1931–1980) are held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford.

<text>Sinesio Baudillo García Fernández (20 May 1897 – 18 October 1983), commonly known by his pseudonym Diego Abad de Santillán, was a Spanish Argentine anarcho-syndicalist economist. Born in León, his family moved to Argentina while he was young. He returned to Spain for his higher education and became involved in the Spanish anarchist movement. After his studies, he went back to Argentina and became involved with the Argentine Regional Workers&#x27; Federation (FORA), co-founding the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA). Following the 1930 Argentine coup d&#x27;état and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, he again went to Spain, becoming involved in the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI). During the Spanish Civil War, he served in the Catalan government as Minister of Economy. After the war, he returned to Argentina and largely ceased political activities, going back to Spain only after the Spanish transition to democracy.

==Biography==
In 1897, Santillán was born Sinesio Baudillo García Fernández in Reyero, a small, isolated town in the region of León. His father was from a Leonese family of blacksmiths and his mother was from an Andalucian family of miners. In 1905, the family moved to Argentina, settling in Santa Fe.

After working a number of jobs, in 1913, the young Sinesio returned to León and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at a local university. After some travels around Catalonia and the Basque Country, in 1915, he enrolled at the University of Madrid, where he studied the humanities, graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy. In the Spanish capital, he began to live a bohemian lifestyle, taking the pseudonym Diego Abad de Santillán while writing for dissident journals.

Santillán participated in the 1917 Spanish general strike, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After receiving an amnesty, he returned to Argentina, briefly reuniting with his family in Santa Fe before moving to the capital Buenos Aires. There he joined the Argentine Regional Workers&#x27; Federation (FORA), working as editor of its newspaper &quot;&quot;. In 1922, he went to Germany and participated in the establishment of the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA), staying behind in Berlin in order to study medicine. There he met a number of famous anarchists, including Max Nettlau, for whom he helped translate his works into Spanish. In 1925, he briefly went to Mexico and helped organise the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) before returning to Argentina, where he took part in the Sacco &amp; Vanzetti defense campaign and wrote a history of anarchism in Argentina. In the wake of the 1930 Argentine coup d&#x27;état, he was sentenced to death for sedition, but managed to escape into exile in the newly-established Spanish Republic.

In Spain, Santillán joined the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and became secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), for which he edited their respective newspapers &quot;Solidaridad Obrera&quot; and &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia and was appointed Minister of Economy in the Catalan government. In the wake of the May Days, he took a critical line against the government of Juan Negrín and the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), publishing &quot;After the Revolution&quot;, which outlined a program for workers&#x27; self-management under anarcho-syndicalism. In the program, Santillán invoked British utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill in his attacks against capitalism, declaring:

When the Republic was defeated, Santillán fled into exile in France, before finally returning to Argentina. There he continued his historical work and contributed to dictionaries and encyclopedias, notably writing &quot;Why We Lost the War&quot;, which his son Luis later adapted into film. He largely ceased political activities and gravitated increasingly towards reformism, defending anarchist collaboration with the Republican government during the war, while also coming to prioritise the abolition of the state over the abolition of capitalism.

During the Spanish transition to democracy, Santillán finally returned to Spain, settling in Barcelona, where he died in 1983.

<text>Jillian Noel Hennessy (born November 25, 1968) is a Canadian actress and singer. She is best known for her roles on the American television series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, on which she played prosecutor Claire Kincaid for three seasons, and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, on which she played the lead character, Jordan Cavanaugh, for six seasons. She has also acted in films such as &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, and the independent films &quot;Chutney Popcorn&quot; and &quot;The Acting Class&quot;, the latter of which she also wrote and co-directed.

==Early life==
Hennessy was born in Edmonton, Alberta. Her father, John Hennessy, was a meat salesman and sales/marketing executive, a job that required considerable travel and resulted in frequent moves for the family. Her mother, Maxine, a secretary, left the family in 1982, leaving her daughter to be partially raised by her paternal grandmother, Eleanor, in Kitchener, Ontario. She has a younger brother, John Paul &quot;J.P.&quot; Hennessy, Jr., an older sister, Faith and an identical twin sister, Jacqueline, who is a magazine writer and TV show host in Canada. Hennessy has Irish, French, Swedish and Italian ancestry on her father&#x27;s side, and mostly Ukrainian Roma, as well as Austrian, ancestry on her mother&#x27;s. She attended Stanley Park Senior Public School and graduated from Grand River Collegiate Institute, both in Kitchener, Ontario, and used to busk in the Toronto subway.

==Career==

Hennessy and her sister, Jacqueline, made their acting debut playing twin call girls in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. She was short listed for the role of Dana Scully on &quot;The X-Files&quot; according to Gillian Anderson, the actress who was eventually chosen for the role.

She appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;&quot; in 1990.

In 1993, she appeared as Dr. Marie Lazarus in &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;.

Hennesey&#x27;s big network breakthrough came in 1993, when Dick Wolf signed Hennessy as assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid in the NBC crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She played the role for three seasons, leaving the show in 1996.

In 1999, she appeared as Lisa in &quot;Chutney Popcorn.&quot; In 2000, Hennessy wrote, produced, and jointly directed (with Elizabeth Holder) an independent film mockumentary titled &quot;The Acting Class&quot;, which looked at the trials and tribulations of a dysfunctional acting class. The film co-starred her sister, Jacqueline, and included cameo appearances from a number of Hennessy&#x27;s former &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; co-stars. She also appeared in the film &quot;Nuremberg&quot;, as Elsie Douglas.

In 2001, she portrayed Jackie Kennedy in the film &quot;Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot&quot;. That same year she appeared in a small role as Commander Mulcahy in the Steven Seagal action film &quot;Exit Wounds&quot;. She received praise from critic Owen Gleiberman who said &quot;With the right role, Hennessy might just be a movie star.&quot; In 2003, she made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Abby Singer&quot;. From 2001 to 2007, she starred on the TV show &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; as title character Jordan Cavanaugh. She also played the wife of Tim Allen&#x27;s character in the 2007 film &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;. On June 9, 2007, she received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

During sessions in Austin, Texas, Hennessy recorded the album &quot;Ghost in My Head&quot;, which was released in June 2009. She performed as a guest of the Indigo Girls on a November 2009 episode of &quot;Mountain Stage&quot;, and was the focus of another episode of the show later the same month. She performed at Lilith Fair in 2010.

Hennessy starred in the independent crime thriller &quot;Small Town Murder Songs&quot; in 2010. She also appeared as a veterinarian in the HBO series &quot;Luck&quot;, and promoted Zaxby&#x27;s &quot;Zalads&quot; in a pair of television commercials in 2012.

In 2015, Hennessy appeared in several episodes of &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;, and in October of that year, her second album, &quot;I Do&quot;, was released.

In 2018, she appeared on the Michael Weatherly series &quot;Bull&quot; as the mother of the deceased hacker character Cable McCrory. Also in 2018, she began the role of Senator Huntington on the series &quot;Yellowstone&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hennessy is multilingual, and fluently speaks English, Italian, French, Spanish, and German. She plays the guitar and sings, and enjoys riding motorcycles with her husband, who she married in 2000. They had a second marriage ceremony in January 2001, which took place at New York City Hall with Mayor Rudy Giuliani officiating. Their first son was born in 2003, and a second was born in 2007.

==In popular culture==
The Minneapolis-based band Mollycuddle wrote the song &quot;The Ballad of Jill Hennessy&quot; in honor of the actress. Hennessy was reportedly very pleased and offered to perform with the band on rhythm guitar.

<text>The Royal Aeronautical Society, also known as the RAeS, is a British multi-disciplinary professional institution dedicated to the global aerospace community. Founded in 1866, it is the oldest aeronautical society in the world. Members, Fellows, and Companions of the society can use the post-nominal letters MRAeS, FRAeS, or CRAeS, respectively.

==Function==
The objectives of The Royal Aeronautical Society include: to support and maintain high professional standards in aerospace disciplines; to provide a unique source of specialist information and a local forum for the exchange of ideas; and to exert influence in the interests of aerospace in the public and industrial arenas, including universities. 

The Royal Aeronautical Society is a worldwide society with an international network of 67 branches. Many practitioners of aerospace disciplines use the Society&#x27;s designatory post-nominals such as FRAeS, CRAeS, MRAeS, AMRAeS, and ARAeS (incorporating the former graduate grade, GradRAeS).

The RAeS headquarters is at 4 Hamilton Place, London, W1J 7BQ. In addition to offices for its staff the building is used for Society events and parts of the building are available for private hire.

Divisions of the Society have been formed in countries and regions that can sustain a number of Branches. Divisions operate with a large degree of autonomy, being responsible for their own branch network, membership recruitment, subscription levels, conference and lecture programmes.

Specialist Groups covering various facets of the aerospace industry exist under the overall umbrella of the Society, with the aim of serving the interests of both enthusiasts and industry professionals. Their remit is to consider significant developments in their field through conferences and lectures, with the intention of stimulating debate and facilitating action on key industry issues. The Groups also act as focal points for all enquiries to the Society concerning their specialist subject matter.

As of September 2013, the Specialist Group committees are: Aerodynamics, Aerospace Medicine, Air Power, Air Law, Air Transport, Airworthiness &amp; Maintenance, Avionics &amp; Systems, Environment, Flight Operations, Flight Simulation, Flight Test, General Aviation, Greener by Design, Historical, Human Factors, Human Powered Flight, Propulsion, Rotorcraft, Space, Structures &amp; Materials, UAS, Weapons Systems &amp; Technologies, and Women in Aviation &amp; Aerospace.

In 2009, the Royal Aeronautical Society formed a group of experts to document how to better simulate aircraft upset conditions, and thus improve training programmes.

==History==

The Society was founded in January 1866 with the name &quot;The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain&quot; and is the oldest aeronautical society in the world. Early or founding members included James Glaisher, Francis Wenham, the Duke of Argyll, and Frederick Brearey. In the first year, there were 65 members, at the end of the second year, 91 members, and in the third year, 106 members. Annual reports were produced in the first decades. In 1868 the Society held a major exhibition at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace with 78 entries. John Stringfellow&#x27;s steam engine was shown there. The Society sponsored the first wind tunnel in 1870–71, designed by Wenham and Browning.

In 1918, the organisation&#x27;s name was changed to the Royal Aeronautical Society.

In 1923 its principal journal was renamed from &quot;The Aeronautical Journal&quot; to &quot;The Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society&quot; and in 1927 the &quot;Institution of Aeronautical Engineers Journal&quot; was merged into it.

In 1940, the RAeS responded to the wartime need to expand the aircraft industry. The Society established a Technical Department to bring together the best available knowledge and present it in an authoritative and accessible form – a working tool for engineers who might come from other industries and lack the specialised knowledge required for aircraft design. This technical department became known as the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU) and eventually became a separate entity in the 1980s.

In 1987 the &#x27;Society of Licensed Aircraft Engineers and Technologists&#x27;, previously called the &#x27;Society of Licensed Aircraft Engineers&#x27; was incorporated into the Royal Aeronautical Society.

==Medals and awards==
In addition to the award of Fellowship of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS), the Society awards several other medals and prizes. These include its Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals. The very first gold medal was awarded in 1909 to the Wright Brothers. Although it is unusual for more than one medal (in each of the three grades) to be awarded annually, since 2004 the Society has also periodically awarded team medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) for exceptional or groundbreaking teamwork in aeronautical research and development. Others awarded have included the R. P. Alston Memorial Prize for developments in flight-testing, the Edward Busk prize for applied aerodynamics, the Wakefield Medal for advances in aviation safety, and an Orville Wright Prize. Honorary Fellowships and Honorary Companionships are awarded as well.

The Sir Robert Hardingham Sword The Sir Robert Hardingham Sword is awarded in recognition of outstanding service to the RAeS by a member of the Society. Nominally an annual award, in practice the award is only made about one year in two.

<text>Charles de l&#x27;Écluse, L&#x27;Escluse, or Carolus Clusius (19 February 1526 – 4 April 1609), seigneur de Watènes, was an Artois doctor and pioneering botanist, perhaps the most influential of all 16th-century scientific horticulturists.

==Life==

Clusius was born Charles de l&#x27; Écluse in 1526, in Arras (Dutch &quot;Atrecht&quot;), then in the County of Artois, Spanish Netherlands, now northern France (Hauts-de-France). At the urging of his father, who wanted him to enter the law, he commenced his studies in Latin and Greek at Louvain, followed by civil law. His father then gave him some money to move to Marburg to further his legal studies, but after eight months when his mentor moved away from Marburg he switched to theology, initially at Marburg and then on the suggestion of one of his professors at Wittenberg, where he also began a study of philosophy. Even at Marburg he had also developed an interest in plants that he continued in Wittenberg. Aware of the emerging study of botany, he decided to move to France to study medicine at the University of Montpellier (1551–1554), under professor Guillaume Rondelet, though he never practiced medicine, or styled himself as a physician. He died in Leiden in the Netherlands in 1609, at the age of 83.

While little is known of his relationships, he formed many friendships, both male and female, and his extensive preserved correspondence throws considerable light on those friendships. His male friends were largely academic, with whom he corresponded in Latin, his female friends (at least 35 are known) predominantly collectors and horticulturalists with whom he corresponded in their vernacular, but treated all with the same respect. Unlike his male friends, who were from all over the world, his women friends were all in the Habsburg countries, especially the southern Netherlands and Austria.

== Work ==

In the 1560s Clusius was employed by the Fugger banking family as tutor to one of Anton Fugger&#x27;s sons and as agent, including a plant collecting expedition to Spain, where he became familiar with plants introduced from the New World. In 1573, with the help of Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, he was appointed prefect (director) of the imperial medical garden in Vienna by Emperor Maximilian II (1564–1576) and made Gentleman of the Imperial Chamber. Busbecq, who had been ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (1554–1562) under the previous emperor, Ferdinand I (1558–1564), was a keen gardener and soon arranged for exotic bulbs to be sent from the court at Constantinople to the gardens in Vienna. Clausius was discharged from the imperial court shortly after the death of Maximilian and accession of his son Rudolf II (1576–1612) in 1576.

After leaving Vienna in the late 1580s he established himself in Frankfurt am Main, before his appointment as professor at the University of Leiden in October 1593, where he also became the first &quot;praefectus&quot; (prefect) of the city&#x27;s new botanical garden, the &quot;Hortus Academicus&quot;, associated with the university. There he helped to create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe and his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate his garden near where it originally lay. He was invited to join the Accademia dei Lincei as a corresponding member in 1604, but declined.

He traveled extensively throughout Europe, furthering his knowledge of plants. Clusius was among the first to study the flora of Austria, under the auspices of Maximilian II. He was the first botanist to climb the Ötscher and the Schneeberg in Lower Austria, which was also the first documented ascent of the latter. His illustrated works form an important chapter in sixteenth century natural history, producing a large body of drawing and watercolours. The latter, forming part of an important collection of late sixteenth century botanical illustration, the &quot;Libri picturati&quot;. He was responsible for the cultivation of a number of plants, new to Europe, including the tulip, potato, and horse chestnut. Clusius was widely influential in European science and culture and his circle of correspondents included princes and aristocrats such as Wilhelm IV of Hessen-Kassel (1567–1592) and Princesse Marie de Brimeu, who was one of his most frequent correspondents.

=== Study of tulips ===

In the history of gardening he is remembered not only for his scholarship but also for his work on tulips. At Leiden, his cultivation of tulips in the botanic gardens there, laid the foundations of the Dutch tulip bulb industry. In particular his observations on tulip&#x27;s &quot;breaking&quot; — a phenomenon discovered in the late 19th century to be due to a virus — causing the many different flamed and feathered varieties, which led to the speculative tulip mania of the 1630s. Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry today.

=== Clusius&#x27; life and times ===

During Clusius&#x27; lifetime, botanical knowledge was undergoing enormous expansion, partly fueled by the expansion of the known plant world by New World exploration, and is thought of as a botanical Renaissance. Europe became engrossed with natural history from the 1530s, and gardening and cultivation of plants became a passion and prestigious pursuit from monarchs to universities. The first botanical gardens appeared as well as the first illustrated botanical encyclopaedias, together with thousands of watercolours and woodcuts. The experience of farmers, gardeners, foresters, apothecaries and physicians was being supplemented by the rise of the plant expert. Collecting became a discipline, specifically the &quot;Kunst- und Wunderkammern&quot; (cabinets of curiosities) outside of Italy and the study of &quot;naturalia&quot; became widespread through many social strata. The great botanists of the sixteenth century were all, like Clusius, originally trained as physicians, who pursued a knowledge of plants not just for medicinal properties, but in their own right. Chairs in botany, within medical faculties were being established in European universities throughout the sixteenth century in reaction to this trend, and the scientific approach of observation, documentation and experimentation was being applied to the study of plants.

Clusius&#x27; influence was a key factor in all these developments with his pioneering and influential publications, and introduction of hitherto unknown exotic plants to the Low Countries. As adviser to princes and aristocrats and central figure of a vast European network of exchange, he successfully transmitted his knowledge widely. He is considered one of the most eminent botanists of the European Renaissance, and his influence on tulip breeding continues to the present day.

=== Publications ===

His first publication was a French translation of Rembert Dodoens&#x27;s herbal, &quot;Histoire des Plantes&quot;, published in Antwerp in 1557 by van der Loë. His &quot;Antidotarium sive de exacta componendorum miscendorumque medicamentorum ratione ll. III ... nunc ex Ital. sermone Latini facti&quot; (1561) initiated his fruitful collaboration with the renowned Plantin printing press at Antwerp, which permitted him to issue late-breaking discoveries in natural history and to ornament his texts with elaborate engravings. Clusius, as he was known to his contemporaries, published two major original works: his &quot;Rariorum aliquot stirpium per Hispanias observatarum historia&quot; (1576)— is one of the earliest books on Spanish flora— and his &quot;Rariorum stirpium per Pannonias observatorum Historiae&quot; (1583) is the first book on Austrian and Hungarian alpine flora.

Clusius&#x27; collected works were published in two parts: &quot;Rariorum plantarum historia&quot; (1601) contains his Spanish and Austrian flora and adds more information about new plants as well as a pioneering mycological study on mushrooms from Central Europe (as appendix: &quot;Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum&quot;, covering toxic fungi in the section: &quot;Fungi noxii et perniciosi&quot;); and &quot;Exoticorum libri decem&quot; (1605) is an important survey of exotic flora and fauna, both still often consulted. His &quot;Rariorum plantarum&quot;, published in four books, is illustrated with many woodcuts of botanical specimens, and is indicative of the new interest in botany and botanical gardens which arose during the Renaissance. He contributed as well to Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s map of Spain. Clusius translated several contemporary works in natural science. 

Clusius&#x27; vast correspondence with his European contemporaries has been preserved at Leiden University Libraries and made available digitally by the Scaliger Institute there (The Clusius Project). The collection contains about 1,500 letters from 320 correspondents in six languages during the period 1560–1609.

== Legacy ==

Justus Lipsius called Clusius &quot;the father of all the beautiful gardens in this country&quot;.

=== Eponomy ===

His contribution to the study of alpine plants has led to many of them being named in his honour, such as &quot;Gentiana clusii&quot;, &quot;Potentilla clusiana&quot; and &quot;Primula clusiana&quot;. The genus &quot;Clusia&quot; (whence the family Clusiaceae) also honours Clusius. His work formed an important step in the development of modern botany.

<doc id="691874" wikidata="Q1142091" url="?curid=691874" title="Nomen nescio">
<text>Nomen nescio (), abbreviated to N.N., is used to signify an anonymous or unnamed person. From Latin &quot;nomen&quot; – &quot;name&quot;, and &quot;nescio&quot; – &quot;I do not know&quot;, it literally means &quot;I do not know the name&quot;. The generic name Numerius Negidius used in Roman times was chosen partly because it shared initials with this phrase.

==Usage==
One use for this name is to protect against retaliation when reporting a crime or company fraud. In the Netherlands, a police suspect who refuses to give his name is given an &quot;N.N. number.&quot; In Germany and Belgium, &quot;N.N.&quot; is also frequently seen in university course lists, indicating that a course will take place but that the lecturer is not yet known; the abbreviation in this case means &quot;nomen nominandum&quot; – &quot;the name is to be announced&quot;. Thus, the meaning is different from the above definition and is the same as TBD (to be decided).

&quot;N. N.&quot; is commonly used in the scoring of chess games, not only when one participant&#x27;s name is genuinely unknown but when an untitled player faces a master, as in a simultaneous exhibition. Another reason is to protect a known player from the insult of a painful defeat.

Genealogists often use the abbreviation to signify an unknown or partially unknown name (such as &quot;N.N.&quot; Jones).

It has increased in usage in online gaming as an insult to mean that someone is unknown within the community.

<doc id="691884" wikidata="Q632762" url="?curid=691884" title="Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge">
<text>The Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge is a religious encyclopedia. It is based on an earlier German encyclopedia, the Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche. 
Like the &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;, it focuses on Christianity from a primarily Protestant point of view.
The final edition, titled &quot;The New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge&quot;, was published
1908–14 in 13 volumes, based on the third edition of the &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot; (1896–1909).

==Publishing history==
The &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;″s publishing history was:

* 1853–1868: 1st ed. Ed. Johann Jakob Herzog (1805–1882). 22 vols.
* c. 1877: new ed. Ed. Herzog and G.L. Plitt (1836–1880).
* 1896–1909: 3rd ed. Ed. Albert Hauck (1845–1918). 22 vols.

The &quot;Schaff-Herzog&quot;″s publishing history was:
* 1882–84: 1st ed. Ed. Philip Schaff (1819–93). (Based on the first two editions of the &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;.)
* 1891: 3rd ed. Ed. Albert Hauck.
* 1908–14: &quot;The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge&quot;. 13 vols. This was a substantial update, based throughout on the &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;, 3rd ed.

Christian Classics Ethereal Library has digitized the work and made it available online. Logos Bible Software is also undertaking a digitization project of it.

&quot;The new Schaff-Herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge, embracing Biblical, historical, doctrinal, and practical theology and Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical biography from the earliest times to the present day&quot;. Edited by Samuel MacAuley Jackson (Volumes 2 to 12 have abbreviated titles which vary slightly; volume 13 is an Index volume, which was edited by George William Gilmore).

==Developments==
The idea of translating &quot;Herzog&quot; in a slightly condensed form occurred to John Henry Augustus Bomberger, a minister of the German Reformed Church, and then president of Ursinus College, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and in 1856 he brought out in Philadelphia the first volume, whose title-page reads thus: &quot;The Protestant Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopedia: Being a Condensed Translation of Herzog&#x27;s Real Encyclopedia. With Additions from Other Sources. By Rev. J. H. A. Bomberger, D.D., Assisted by Distinguished Theologians of Various Denominations. Vol. I. Philadelphia: Lindsay &amp; Blakiston, x 1856&quot;. In this work he associated with himself twelve persons, all but one ministers. In 1860 he issued the second volume. But the American Civil War breaking out the next year put a stop to so costly an enterprise and it was never resumed. The first volume included the article &quot;Concubinage&quot;, the second &quot;Josiah&quot;. It had been issued in numbers, of which the last was the twelfth.

In 1877 Professor Philip Schaff (1819–93) was asked by Dr. Herzog himself to undertake an English reproduction of the second edition of his encyclopedia, and this work was fairly begun when, in the autumn of 1880, Clemens Petersen and Samuel Macauley Jackson were engaged to work daily on it in Dr. Schaff&#x27;s study in the Bible House, New York City. The next year Dr. Schaff&#x27;s son, the Rev. David Schley Schaff, later professor of church history in the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa., joined the staff. The original publishers were S. S. Scranton &amp; Company, Hartford, Conn., but a change was made before the issue of the first volume and the encyclopedia was issued by Funk &amp; Wagnalls. The title-page read thus:

&quot;A Religious Encyclopædia: or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology. Based on the Real-Encyklopädie of Herzog, Plitt, and Hauck. Edited by Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Associate editors: Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, M. A., and Rev. D. S. Schaff. Volume I. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Publishers, 10 and 18 Dey Street&quot;. The first volume was issued Wednesday, November 1, 1882, the second Thursday, March 1, 1883, and the third Tuesday, March 4, 1884. Volume I. had pp. xix. 1–847; volume II. pp. xvii. 848–1714; and volume III. pp. xix. 1715–2631. In November, 1886, a revised edition was issued and at the same time the &quot;Encyclopedia of Living Divines and Christian Workers of All Denominations in Europe and America, Being a Supplement to Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Edited by Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., and Rev. Samuel Macauley Jackson, M. A. New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Publishers, 18 and 20 Astor Place, 1887&quot;. In 1891 the third edition of the encyclopedia was issued and with it was incorporated the &quot;Encyclopedia of Living Divines&quot;, with an appendix, largely the work of Rev. George William Gilmore, bringing the biographical and literary notices down to December, 1890. The entire work was repaged sufficiently to make it one of four volumes of about equal size, and it is this four-volume edition which is known to the public as the &quot;Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia&quot;, the volumes being respectively of pp. xlviii. 679 and four pages unnumbered; 680–1378; 1379–2086; iv. 2087–2629, viii. 296. As the German work at its base was overtaken by the time &quot;S&quot; had been reached, the &quot;Schaff-Herzog&quot; from that letter on was based on the first edition of &quot;Herzog&quot;. Therefore, much of its matter is now very old. Yet it has been a useful work, and in 1903 its publishers determined on a new edition based on the third edition of &quot;Herzog&quot; which had been appearing since 1896. But inasmuch as there was a space of ten years between the beginnings of the two works, it has been necessary to bring the matter from the German down to date. This end has been accomplished by two courses: first by securing from the German contributors to &quot;Herzog&quot; condensations of their contributions, in which way matter contributed to the German work has in many instances been brought down to date, and second by calling on department editors for supplementary matter.

&quot;The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopædia of Religious Knowledge&quot; followed the previous editions. The points of similarities were:

* that at its base lay the &quot;Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie and Kirche&quot;
* that it gave in condensed form the information in that work, and took such matter directly from the German work in most instances, although occasionally while the topic was the same the treatment was independent of the German original;
* that it had much new information contributed by the editorial staff and specially secured contributors;
* that in biblical matters it limited its titles to those of the German base, so that it should not be considered to be a Bible dictionary.

The points of dissimilarity were:

* The new edition contains much information furnished directly by those contributors to the German work who have kindly consented to condense their articles and bring them within prescribed limits. These limits were often narrow, but in no other way was it possible to utilize the German text;
* The new edition contains hundreds of sketches of contemporary persons derived in almost every instance from information furnished by themselves. The entries are in more detail than those in the British and American &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; and from the German &quot;Wer ist&#x27;s&quot; (a similar work for Germany);
* A much more thorough bibliography was furnished than in previous editions. The attempt was made to give sources so that students could pursue a subject to its roots; second, to supply the best literature in whatever language it occurred; third, to supply references in English for those who only read that language.

<doc id="691889" wikidata="Q6230488" url="?curid=691889" title="John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton">
<text>John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton (18 October 1731 – 18 August 1783), of Spitchwick the parish of Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon, was an English lawyer and politician, born in Ashburton in Devon, who served as Solicitor-General from 1768. He was first noticed in English politics when he wrote a notice in 1762 defending the British East India Company merchants against their Dutch rivals. He was a member of parliament from 1768 onward. His career in the House of Commons is best known for his motion in 1780 that &quot;the influence of the crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished&quot;. He was created Baron Ashburton in 1782.

==Early life==
He was born at Ashburton in Devon on 18 October 1731. He was a younger son of John Dunning of Ashburton, attorney, by his wife Agnes Judsham, daughter of Henry Judsham, attorney, of Old Port in the parish of Modbury, Devon. After receiving education at Ashburton Grammar School, he was articled to his father, who had a legal practice in the town. He went to London to study for the bar, and was admitted a student of the Middle Temple on 8 May 1752.

==Legal career==
While a student Dunning became close to Lloyd Kenyon and John Horne Tooke. He was called to the bar on 2 July 1756, and joined the western circuit. For several years after his call he had little success. In 1762, however, John Glynn, one of the leading counsel on the circuit, suddenly fell ill, and placed his briefs in Dunning&#x27;s hands. By 1764 he was making £2,000 a year, helped by his pamphlet, drawn up by Dunning on behalf of the directors of the English East India Company. In 1765 he established his legal reputation by his arguments against the legality of general warrants in the case of Leach v. Money.

In 1766 Dunning was appointed recorder of Bristol, and on 28 January 1768 he became Solicitor-General in the Duke of Grafton&#x27;s administration, in the place of Edward Willes, who was raised to the bench.

==Parliamentarian==
At the general election in March 1768, Dunning, through the influence of Lord Shelburne, was returned to parliament as one of the members for the borough of Calne. Though solicitor-general, he took no part in the debate on the expulsion of John Wilkes from the house, and was absent from the division. On 9 January 1770 Dunning both spoke in favour of the amendment to the address urging an inquiry into the causes of &quot;the unhappy discontents which at present prevail in every part of his majesty&#x27;s dominions&quot;; and a few days later tendered his resignation. On 19 March he spoke on the side of the minority in the debate on the remonstrance of the city of London. After some delay Edward Thurlow was appointed solicitor-general on 30 March 1770.

On 12 October 1770 the freedom of the city of London was voted to Dunning. In the debate which took place on 25 March 1771, Dunning made a speech against Welbore Ellis&#x27;s motion to commit Alderman Richard Oliver to the Tower of London, in which he denied the right of the house to commit in such a case. Dunning opposed the third reading of the bill for regulating the government of Massachusetts Bay on 2 May 1774. At the general election in October 1774 he was re-elected for Calne, and continued to oppose the ministerial policy towards the American colonies. On 6 November 1776 he supported Lord John Cavendish&#x27;s defeated motion for the &quot;revisal of all acts of parliament by which his majesty&#x27;s subjects in America think themselves aggrieved&quot;. In the next session Dunning, continued to oppose the ministry, and was instrumental in obtaining the insertion of a clause in the bill for the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which lessened its scope.

On 14 May 1778 Dunning seconded Sir George Savile&#x27;s motion for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of Roman Catholics; and it was on his amendment that the house unanimously voted that a monument should be erected in Westminster Abbey to the memory of the Earl of Chatham. On 21 February 1780 he supported Savile&#x27;s motion for an account of crown pensions; and on 6 April moved his famous resolutions that &quot;the influence of the crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished&quot;, and that &quot;it is competent to this house to examine into and correct abuses in the expenditure of the civil list revenues, as well as in every other branch of the public revenue, whenever it shall appear expedient to the wisdom of the house so to do&quot;. In the teeth of Lord North&#x27;s opposition, the first resolution (with a slight addition) was carried by 233 to 215, and the second agreed to without a division. Dunning a few weeks later proposed an address to the king requesting him not to dissolve the parliament; he found himself in a minority of 51.

At the general election in September 1780 Dunning was again returned for Calne, and proposed the re-election of Sir Fletcher Norton as Speaker, but Cornwall, the ministerial candidate, was elected by 203 to 134. In February 1782 he supported Conway&#x27;s motion against the further prosecution of the American war, and a month later announced that arrangements were being made for the formation of a new ministry. On 27 March 1782 Dunning, with Lord John Cavendish, Charles James Fox, Edmund Burke, and Augustus Keppel, was admitted to the privy council, and on 8 April was created Baron Ashburton of Ashburton in the county of Devon. The king retained Thurlow as Lord Chancellor, and Dunning was sworn in as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 17 April. He continued in the cabinet after Lord Rockingham&#x27;s death, and was consulted by Shelburne in legal matters, but took little part in debates in the House of Lords.

==Works==
Dunning was supposed by some to have been the author of &quot;A Letter to the Proprietors of East India Stock on the subject of Lord Clive&#x27;s Jaghire, occasioned by his Lordship&#x27;s letter on that subject&quot; (London, 1764), and also of an &quot;Inquiry into the Doctrines lately promulgated concerning Juries, Libels, &amp;c., upon the principles of the Law and the Constitution&quot;. The joint authorship of &quot;Junius&#x27;s Letters&quot; has also been attributed to him.

==Marriage and progeny==
On 31 March 1780, Dunning married Elizabeth Baring (21 July 1744 – 23 February 1809), daughter of the Exeter cloth merchant Johann (John) Baring (1697–1748) of Larkbear House, near Exeter, Devon (born in Bremen, Germany, as &quot;Johann&quot; Baring and naturalised 1723), by his wife Elizabeth Vowler. Elizabeth was the sister of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet (1740–1810), and John Baring (1730–1816), who in partnership founded the precursor to Barings Bank. In 1805, Elizabeth built to the designs of John Nash a &quot;villa rustica&quot; country house at Sandridge Park in the parish of Stoke Gabriel. By Elizabeth he had two sons:
* John Dunning (29 October 1781 – April 1783), eldest son, who predeceased his father 
* Richard Dunning, 2nd Baron Ashburton (20 September 1782 – 15 February 1823), who on 17 September 1805 married Anne, daughter of William Cunninghame of Lainshaw. He died without issue at Friar&#x27;s Hall, Roxburghshire, whereupon the title became extinct. The title Baron Ashburton was in 1835 re-created for his first cousin Alexander Baring, the second son of Sir Francis Baring.

==Death and succession==
On Shelburne&#x27;s resignation, Dunning had several interviews with the king, who asked his advice on the formation of a new ministry. Before the act for the reform in the civil list expenditure (22 George III, c. 82) was passed, a pension of £4,000 was granted to Dunning. His health, however, had begun to give way, and he died at Exmouth a few months after the death of his eldest child, on 18 August 1783. He was buried in the parish church of Ashburton, where a monument was erected to his memory.

<text>An Interpol notice is an international alert circulated by Interpol to communicate information about crimes, criminals, and threats by police in a member state (or an authorised international entity) to their counterparts around the world. The information disseminated via notices concerns individuals wanted for serious crimes, missing persons, unidentified bodies, possible threats, prison escapes, and criminals&#x27; &quot;modus operandi&quot;.

There are eight types of notices, seven of which are colour-coded by their function: red, blue, green, yellow, black, orange, and purple. The best-known notice is the &quot;red notice&quot;, which is the &quot;closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today&quot;. An eighth &quot;special notice&quot; is issued at the request of the United Nations Security Council.

Notices published by Interpol are made either on the organisation&#x27;s own initiative or are based on requests from national central bureaus (NCBs) of member states or authorised international entities such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. All notices are published on Interpol&#x27;s secure website. Extracts of notices may also be published on Interpol&#x27;s public website if the requesting entity agrees.

Interpol may only publish a notice that adheres to all the proper legal conditions. For example, a notice will not be published if it violates Interpol&#x27;s constitution, which forbids the organisation from undertaking activities of a political, military, religious, or racial character. Interpol may refuse to publish a notice that it considers inadvisable or a potential risk.

Notices may be issued in any of the four official languages of Interpol: English, French, Spanish, and Arabic.

==Notice types==
In 2025, Interpol began piloting a Silver Notice for assets used in criminal activities. Similar to the notice is another request for cooperation or alert mechanism known as a &quot;diffusion&quot;. This is less formal than a notice, but also is used to request the arrest or location of an individual or additional information in relation to a police investigation. A diffusion is circulated directly by a member state or international entity to the countries of their choice, or to the entire Interpol membership and is simultaneously recorded in Interpol&#x27;s databases.

==History==

The International notice system was created in 1946 as Interpol re-established itself after World War II in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Cloud. It initially consisted of six colour-coded notices; Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, and Purple. In 2004, the seventh colour was added, Orange.

In 2005, the Interpol-United Nations Security Council special notice was created at the request of the UN Security Council through Resolution 1617 to provide better tools to help the Security Council carry out its mandate regarding the freezing of assets, travel bans, and arms embargoes aimed at individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and was adopted by Interpol at its 74th General Assembly in Berlin in September 2005.

==Controversy==
===Red notice controversies===

In his book &quot;Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man&#x27;s Fight for Justice&quot;, Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, describes how the Russian government repeatedly requested that Interpol issue a red notice for his arrest. Interpol refused to do so on the basis that it deemed the request was &quot;predominantly political in nature and therefore contrary to INTERPOL&#x27;s rules and regulations&quot;. Unable to secure his extradition, Browder was subsequently tried and convicted by a Moscow court for tax evasion &quot;in absentia&quot;.

In January 2017, United Kingdom-based NGO Fair Trials called on Interpol to introduce more rigorous checks. Fair Trial chief executive Jago Russell stated, &quot;Interpol has been allowing itself to be used by oppressive regimes across the world to export the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents&quot;. There have been concerns about conflict of interest as well as in March 2017, the UAE donated $54 million to Interpol, which roughly equalled the contributions by all other member states. Interpol&#x27;s secretary-general, Jurgen Stock, stated that Interpol had introduced a task force to review requests &quot;even more intensively&quot;.

In June 2020, Iran issued an arrest warrant for U.S. President Donald Trump and 35 other U.S. political and military officials for their role in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani and asked Interpol to issue a red notice.

It was shown in 2013 that Interpol red notices were sometimes inaccurate and could be politically motivated. NGOs such as Fair Trials International have pointed to its limited internal controls to tackle political abuses. Many of its members have poor human rights records and corrupt, undemocratic governments and have been accused of abusing the red notice networks for political purposes.

Some red notices are controversial and have been used to persecute opponents of regimes, for example the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, whose red notice was removed because it was shown to be a political request.

Interpol issued a new refugee policy in 2015, stipulating that a red notice should not be issued against a refugee when it has been requested by the country from which the refugee initially fled.

In November 2018, Bahrain issued a red notice for footballer and dissident Hakeem al-Araibi, who had fled Bahrain in 2014 and been granted refugee status in Australia some years later. He was arrested on arrival in Thailand with his wife for a honeymoon in November 2018 by Thai police on the basis of the red notice, despite the red notice being withdrawn a few days later on the basis of illegality. On 11 February, he was released after Thai prosecutors dropped the case, arriving in Australia the following day. He was granted Australian citizenship one month later, on 12 March 2019.

There has been growing concern about refugees being targeted by red notices illegally. Recent examples before al-Araibi&#x27;s case include the detention of Russian activist Petr Silaev in Spain and Algerian human rights lawyer Rachid Mesli in Italy. In al-Araibi&#x27;s case, despite the red notice being withdrawn only a few days after being issued, Bahrain nonetheless issued an extradition order, and Thailand complied, leading to a trial in which al-Araibi had to defend his opposition to the extradition.

==Commission for the Control of Interpol&#x27;s Files==

The Commission for the Control of Interpol&#x27;s Files (CCF) is an independent monitoring body. It operates in line with a number of official rules and documents and has three main functions:
* Monitoring the application of data protection rules to personal data processed by Interpol
* Advising with regard to any operations or projects concerning the processing of personal information
* Processing requests for access to Interpol&#x27;s files

In 2008, the Interpol General Assembly voted to amend Interpol&#x27;s constitution to integrate the CCF into its internal legal structure, thereby guaranteeing its independence.

The CCF&#x27;s most notable function, however, is to consider legal petitions submitted by individuals requesting the revocation of red notices. Such petitions, as a rule, only succeed when a red notice is deemed to infringe on Interpol&#x27;s Constitution either because it offends the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or because it was issued for political, religious, military, or racial reasons.

==In popular culture==

* In the original 1985 version of the Broderbund video game &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, the first part of the player&#x27;s objective in each mission is to obtain an Interpol red notice (imprecisely described as a &quot;warrant to arrest&quot;) against a member of a fictional crime syndicate.
* &quot;Black Notice&quot;, a crime novel by Patricia Cornwell, was named after the Interpol procedure.
* The films &quot;Red Notice&quot; and &quot;&quot; were named after the Interpol procedure.

<text>Lord John Cavendish (22 October 1732 – 18 December 1796) was a British nobleman and politician.

==Background==
Cavendish was the youngest son of William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, and his wife Catherine, daughter of John Hoskins. Prime Minister William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, Lord George Cavendish and Field Marshal Lord Frederick Cavendish were his elder brothers. He was educated at Newcome&#x27;s School in Hackney and at Peterhouse, Cambridge.

==Political career==
He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1782 and 1783, and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1782. He was a supporter of Lord Rockingham, and subsequently of the Fox-North Coalition that brought the Duke of Portland to power. He lost his seat in the election of 1784, when the coalition fell, and did not return to the House of Commons until 1794, in the family seat of Derbyshire.

==Family==
Cavendish lived at Billing Hall, Northamptonshire which he commissioned John Carr to substantially remodel in the fashionable Palladian style around 1776. The house passed to the Elwes family in 1790.

He died unmarried in December 1796, aged 64.

==Legacy==

Cavendish&#x27;s friend Edmund Burke penned several eulogies of him after his death: &quot;The world never produced a more upright and honourable mind; with very considerable talents, and a still more considerable improvement of them&quot;.

There is lost to the world, in every thing but the example of his life the fairest mind that perhaps ever infor&#x27;d a human body. A mind totally free from every Vice, and fill&#x27;d with Virtues of all kinds, and in each kind of no common rank or form; benevolent, friendly, generous, disinterested, unambitious almost to a fault; Tho&#x27; cold in his exterior, he was inwardly quick and full of feeling, and tho&#x27; reserv&#x27;d from modesty, from dignity, from family temperament and not from design, he was an entire stranger to every thing false and counterfeit: so great an Enemy to all dissimulation active or passive, and indeed even to a fair and just ostentation, that some of his Virtues, obscur&#x27;d by his other Virtues, wanted something of that burnish and lustre which those who know how to assay the solidity and fineness of the metal wish&#x27;d them to have. It were to be wish&#x27;d that he had had more of that Vanity of which we who acted on the same stage had enough and to spare. I have known very few men of better natural Parts, and none more perfected by every species of elegant and usefull erudition. He served the publick often out of Office, sometimes in it, with Fidelity, and diligence, and when the occasion call&#x27;d for it, with a manly resolution. At length when he was overborne by the Torrent, he retir&#x27;d from a world that certainly was not worthy of him. He was of a character that seems as if it were peculiar to this Country. He was exactly what we conceive an English Nobleman of the old Stamp, and one born in better times.

Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; sketched Cavendish&#x27;s character:

Lord John Cavendish was listened to, whenever he rose, with...deference or predilection. His near alliance to the Duke of Devonshire; his very name, connected with the Revolution of 1688, which secured the liberties of Great Britain; his unblemished reputation, and his talents, though very moderate;—all these qualities combined to impress with esteem, even those who differed most from him in political opinion. Nature had in the most legible characters stamped honesty on his countenance.

<doc id="691904" wikidata="Q2258200" url="?curid=691904" title="Pietro Acciarito">
<text>Pietro Umberto Acciarito (27 June 1871 – 4 December 1943) was an Italian anarchist who at the age of 25 attempted to assassinate the then king of Italy, Umberto I.

== Early life ==
Acciarito was born in Artena, where his family had migrated to a decade before his birth. His parents were Camillo Acciarito, and Anna Jossi. Acciarito&#x27;s family were in a state of poverty due to Rome&#x27;s housing construction boom in the 1880s which the Italian government did nothing to relieve.

In 1885 Acciarito found work as a blacksmith with the Bank of Naples however due to his frustration with the lack of payment he was dismissed. He then proceeded to form his own business, but the depressed economy of the time meant business was low.

Acciarito frequently dealt with suicidal thoughts which were exasperated by his inability to marry his lover Pasqua Venaruba, whom he met in the summer of 1886. He disclosed to his friends that if were to commit suicide he would do so in a way which would send a message to the Italian government: &quot;the government must provide for the poor people&quot;.

== Assassination attempt ==

As Acciarito&#x27;s anger and disillusionment grew, reports of him muttering to himself, intending to kill either himself or someone of status soon emerged. His father became worried and reported Acciarito to the police. The police were unable to locate him so the Police Chief of Rome, Ernesto Martelli, informed all those concerned with the King&#x27;s safety to be on high alert.

On 20 April 1897, he closed his workshop permanently and visited his father announcing that it was the last time they would see each other. Acciarito soon learned of the king&#x27;s appearance at the derby horse Capannelle track outside of Rome on 22 April 1897. Aware that Umberto was travelling along the Via Appia Nuova, Acciarito waited for him near the Porta San Giovanni, armed only with a homemade dagger. The royal carriage arrived at 14:00 to which Acciarito attacked the carriage and attempted to murder the king although it failed and he was subsequently detained.

=== Aftermath ===
After the attempted assassination, anarchists and socialists were routinely harassed and arrested, particularly those in the Esquilino district, the arrests included the staff of the &quot;L&#x27;Agitazione&quot; (the turmoil), Acciarito&#x27;s friends who were deemed, accomplices along with a man named Romeo Frezzi who possessed a photo including Acciarito which was used as evidence for his and the other men in the photo&#x27;s involvement. Frezzi was soon found dead after his arrest, which the police claimed was either a suicide or brain aneurysm, however, evidence found in the autopsy report showed he was certainly beaten to death by prison guards. Frezzi soon became mystified and used as a symbol of an oppressive regime prosecuting and abusing innocents and protests soon erupted all throughout Italy. Despite claims by the police there was no proof of Acciarto having any associates or any connection to anarchists whatsoever. Legalisation was then proposed to clamp down on the press with greater censorship and prevent the election of democrats and socialists.

Acciarito&#x27;s trial took place on 28-29 May 1897, at the Rome Court of Assize. Chief prosecutor Eugenio Forni hoped to establish a connection between the attack and the anarchist movement although Acciarito denied such a connection existing, never referring to anarchist principles, ideas or even identifying as one. Acciarito was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, with the first seven years spent in solitary confinement in chains and provided with a diet which could barely sustain life. Acciarito seemed unfazed, with him commenting &quot;Very well, me today, tomorrow the bourgeois government. Long live the social revolution!. Long Live Anarchy!&quot;.

== Life in prison, second trial and death ==

Despite absolute proof of no connection to anarchism or others involved, the state still claimed otherwise saying that the anarchist socialist party based in Ancona were responsible. The government tried to coerce him into confessing the identity of assumed associates such as informing Acciarito of his friend&#x27;s arrest and placing a fellow prisoner into the adjacent cell posing as an anarchist hoping to gain Acciarito&#x27;s trust. When these proved to be fruitless they convinced a new plan amounting to psychological torture-convince Acciarito that his girlfriend had given birth to a son. Acciarito quickly become obsessed with this hypothetical child and feared he would be killed unless Acciarito collaborated and named associates. Acciartito quickly requested to write to his son, which was then used against him as prison officials drafted a false letter imitating the nonexistent child in the hope of Acciartito confessing in order to secure a pardon.

On 2 December 1898, he signed a petition requesting pardon. Weeks later once it became clear that this was to no avail he signed a second petition this time naming supposed associates &quot;Collabona, Gudini and Trenta&quot;. Collabona and Gudini pleaded their innocence, stating their only involvement was searching for him on 22 April to notify him of the police&#x27;s search. He would later apologise to both for implicating them, believing it to be necessary for a pardon. At the hearing of his pardon, Acciarito was informed that the son he believed to exist, was instead a fabrication. Acciarito, devastated, then placed into evidence the letters he had supposedly received from his son. The defence attorneys questioned as to why such flagrant abuse could knowingly happen to which the prison officials replied that they believed it was in the best interest of the state. On 3 July 1899, the trial was suspended, however, it quickly resumed to which Acciarito discredited his past testimonies restating that he was the only perpetrator. On 5 April 1900, he was acquitted of all charges, however, a pardon was never granted. Acciarito would spend the rest of his life in prison and a mental asylum upon being diagnosed as insane.

He died in prison age (72) at Italy.

== Legacy ==
Acciarito is one of a long line of Italian anarchist attempted assassins, including Gaetano Bresci&#x27;s successful assassination of Umberto I, Michele Angiolillo&#x27;s assassination of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, Sante Geronimo Caserio&#x27;s assassination of Marie François Sadi Carnot, among many others.

<text>Concert dance (also known as performance dance or theatre dance in the United Kingdom) is dance performed for an audience. It is frequently performed in a theatre setting, though this is not a requirement, and it is usually choreographed and performed to set music.

By contrast, social dance and participation dance may be performed without an audience and, typically, these dance forms are neither choreographed nor danced to set music, though there are exceptions. For example, some ceremonial dances and baroque dances blend concert dance with participation dance by having participants assume the role of performer or audience at different moments.

==Forms==
Many dance styles are principally performed in a concert dance context, including these:

*Ballet originated as courtroom dance in Italy, then flourished in France and Russia before spreading across Europe and abroad. Over time, it became an academic discipline taught in schools and institutions. Amateur and professional troupes formed, bringing ballet from the courts to the theater and making it one of the most widely performed concert dance styles today.
*Modern dance and contemporary dance emerged largely as 20th century offshoot of traditional ballet technique; although modern and contemporary dance have each evolved their own quality of movement, sharing only a portion of their common repertoire of techniques, both of the newer genres continue to be performed primarily in a concert/theatre hall setting.
*Acrobatic dance emerged in the United States and Canada in the early 1900s as one of the types of acts performed in vaudeville. Acro dance has evolved significantly since then, with dance movements now founded in ballet technique. From its inception, acro dance has been a concert dance form.
*Classical Indian dance originated in temples in India. After the Indian independence movement (1947 to 1950), dance became a university subject, dance schools appeared for the first time, and classical Indian dance became a concert dance form performed in theaters.
*Classical Persian dance was elevated to an art form during the Qajar dynasty (1795 to 1925). It was performed in the royal court of the Shah and it remained there and among the elite and bourgeois families until the 20th century. Since then, it has evolved into its modern-day form and become a widely performed concert dance style.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, theatre dance is a common term used to indicate a range of performance dance disciplines, and widely used in reference to the teaching of dance. The UK has a number of dance training and examination boards, with the majority having a separate branch dedicated to theatre dance, with codified syllabi in each technique. Many dance teachers and schools worldwide, prepare their pupils for dance examinations and qualifications with a UK-based organisation, with notable examples including the Royal Academy of Dance, the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing and the International Dance Teachers Association. All UK theatre dance organisations are consistent in offering classical ballet, tap and modern or jazz as their core theatre branch subjects. Many also offer &#x27;theatre craft&#x27; or &#x27;stage dance&#x27;, which is devised to reflect the choreography seen in musical theatre.

<doc id="691912" wikidata="Q2746880" url="?curid=691912" title="Ramón Acín">
<text>Ramón Acín Aquilué (30 August 1888, Huesca, Aragon, Spain – 6 August 1936) was a Spanish anarcho-syndicalist, teacher, painter, sculptor, writer and avant-garde artist who was murdered by fascists in the first year of the Spanish Civil War.

Acín was a friend of film director Luis Buñuel and provided some of the money for &quot;Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan&quot; (1932) and so is credited as co-producer of the film.

== Biography ==
Ramón Acín Aquilué was the son of Santos Acín Muliera, a surveyor engineer, and María Aquilué Royán. Ramón was the youngest of four siblings. Ramón&#x27;s other siblings were named Santos, Ascensión, and Enriqueta.
Acín was interested in painting from an early age, beginning drawing classes with the painter Felix Lafuente at the age of 10. At 12 he entered the Second Teaching Institute in Huesca. In 1907 he enrolled in chemical sciences at the Faculty of Sciences of Zaragoza.

Towards the end of 1908 Acín left his career in chemistry and returned to Huesca. He was supposed to join the army in 1909, but was freed of military service because his parents were in their sixties. The same year he went to Madrid to oppose a public works project, fails to defeat it, and returns to Huesca to take drawing classes in the prive academy of the painter Anselmo Gascón de Gotor.

Afterwards Acín decided to dedicate himself exclusively to art. In August 1910 &quot;El Diario de Avisios de Zaragoza&quot; published his first illustrations. In August 1911 his illustration of the celebrations of San Lorenzo were used as the cover of the magazine and at the end of the same year one of his drawings was used as the cover of the satirical magazine &quot;Don Pepito.&quot;

In January 1912 &quot;El Diaro de Huesca&quot; came under the direction of Luis López Allué and Acín was put in charge of the humor section where he used the pen name &quot;Fray Acin&quot;. At the same time Acín began to published political cartoons with other progressive newspapers: &quot;El Pueblo, Vida Socialista,&quot; and others.

In July 1913 Acín settled in Barcelona at the request of his friend Ángel Samblancat with whom he founded the weekly newspaper &quot;La Ira.&quot; In the first issue of &quot;La Ira&quot; he published a vignette entitled &quot;Id Vosotros&quot; which fiercely criticized the war with Morocco. In the second he wrote &quot;No Riais,&quot; a hash criticism of the church. After the second issue the editors of &quot;La Ira&quot; were imprisoned and the newspaper closed.

=== Execution ===
With the 1936 coup d&#x27;état, Acín fought against the fascist-aligned military rebellion until he was forced to hide after Huesca was besieged by the nationalists. On 6 August 1936 Acín emerged from hiding in order to protect his wife and was executed. His wife Conchita was murdered seventeen days later, along with a hundred Republican soldiers.

<doc id="691917" wikidata="Q4676846" url="?curid=691917" title="Acting (law)">
<text>In law, a person is acting in a position if they are not serving in the position on a permanent basis. This may be the case if the position has not yet been formally created, the person is only occupying the position on an interim basis, the person does not have a mandate, or if the person meant to execute the role is incompetent or incapacitated.

== Business ==
Organizations are advised to have a succession plan including the designation of an acting CEO if the person in that job vacates that position before a replacement has been determined. For example, the lead director on the board of directors may be designated to assume the responsibilities of the CEO until the board finds a new CEO.

== Politics ==

Examples of acting positions in politics include acting mayor, acting governor, acting president, and acting prime minister. Officials in an acting position sometimes do not have the full powers of a properly appointed official, and are often the proper official&#x27;s deputy or longest serving subordinate. Being placed in an acting position is a good indicator that the acting person has the confidence of their superiors or colleagues, and is likely to be chosen for the position on a permanent basis.

== Legal frameworks ==

=== Commonwealth ===
In Commonwealth countries including Australia and Canada, the Carltona doctrine is the overarching legal principle governing when a minister may be said to be acting for or on behalf of a government department.

=== United States ===
The 1910 edition of &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;acting&quot; as a &quot;term employed to designate a &quot;locum tenens&quot; who is performing the duties of an office to which he does not himself claim title&quot;. The 1914 edition of &quot;Corpus Juris Secundum&quot; gives much the same account.

&quot;Fraser v. United States&quot;, the first case cited in the &quot;Black&#x27;s&quot; entry on &quot;acting&quot;, concerns James G. Hill, the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Hill had been suspended with pay while being investigated for a charge of fraud. Another person, John Fraser, was then directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to take charge of and perform the duties of Hill&#x27;s office as &quot;Acting&quot; Supervising Architect. Officially, Fraser was merely a contractor who had been contracted to oversee the construction of a building for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. When Hill was returned to his position some five and a half months later, Fraser sought to be compensated for the time he had worked as Acting Supervising Architect, seeking the difference between the salary for that office and his much lower pay as a contracting architect for the Treasury. The Court of Claims found that the &quot;acting&quot; position was not a statutory creation, and that Fraser was entitled to no pay beyond that of his contract for the period.

The rules for appointment of acting officials are covered in many cases by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA). Legal scholar Anne Joseph O&#x27;Connell notes that one central—and unresolved—question about the nature of acting officials under FVRA is their status under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution of the United States. O&#x27;Connell observes that portions of FVRA, an act of Congress which sets out a detailed scheme for filling vacant positions in federal agencies, may be unconstitutional if acting officials can be &quot;principal&quot; officers under the Appointments Clause. The constitutional issue emerges because the Appointments Clause requires principal officers to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. If acting officers who take office pursuant to FVRA—not pursuant to presidential nomination and Senate confirmation—can be considered principal officers, then the FVRA would be unconstitutional to the extent that it allows this to occur. Heilpern, for his part, argues that acting Cabinet-level officials are principal officers.

<text>Arthur Charles Townley (December 30, 1880 – November 7, 1959) was an American political organizer best known as the founder of the National Non-Partisan League (NPL), a farmers&#x27; organization which had considerable political success in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota during the second half of the 1910s.

== Early life ==
Townley was born December 30, 1880, near Browns Valley, Minnesota, the son of Fitch R. Townley and Esther J. Cross, and graduated from high school in Alexandria, Minnesota.

== Career ==
He moved to western North Dakota to farm with his brother Covert, and participated in a failed large-scale wheat farming venture in Colorado before returning to North Dakota in 1907.

By 1912, Townley owned considerable area near Beach, North Dakota, and was being called the &quot;Flax King of the Northwest&quot;. In August 1913, a freak snowstorm together with the fluctuations of a speculative grain market ruined him financially, causing an abrupt change in vocation.

=== Politics ===
After joining the Socialist Party of North Dakota and running unsuccessfully for the state legislature in 1914, he abandoned the Socialists and criss-crossed the state in a borrowed Model-T Ford, signing up members in a new political party called the Nonpartisan League. His message resonated with the grievances of small farmers against the exploitative big interests: the Minneapolis grain merchants, the railroads, and the eastern banks.

In 1916, the Nonpartisan League candidate, Lynn Frazier, won the North Dakota gubernatorial election, and in 1919 the state legislature enacted the entire NPL program, consisting of state-owned banks, mills, grain elevators and hail insurance agencies. However, the political winds soon turned. Newspapers and business groups portrayed the NPL as socialist, and the NPL&#x27;s lack of political experience led to infighting and corruption. Frazier became the first U.S. state governor to be recalled.

Townley&#x27;s popularity declined along with the NPL. Near the end of World War I, Townley was arrested in Jackson County, Minnesota for &quot;conspiracy to discourage enlistments,&quot; based on League pamphlets that questioned the motivations of the American war effort. He was convicted by a jury hand-picked by a virulent anti-League judge and served 90 days for the offense in 1921, after appeals were exhausted. One of the only other inhabitants of the Jackson County jail was a boy who was serving 30 days due to his inability to pay the fine for stealing an old automobile tire. Townley paid his $25 fine and gave him train fare home.

Finding himself increasingly irrelevant to NPL affairs, he drifted from one failed project to another. He founded the short-lived National Producer&#x27;s Alliance in 1923, and later promoted the drilling of an oil well in Robinson, North Dakota in 1926. Through the depression, he worked as a traveling salesman.

In 1934, Townley was a candidate for the Farmer-Labor nomination in Minnesota&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the primary and as an independent candidate for Governor of Minnesota in the general election. In the former he lost to Rich T. Buckler with 13,671 votes to Buckler&#x27;s 17,874 votes. In the latter he finished fourth of five candidates with 4,454 votes.

During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, he lectured for donations on the evils of communism. His public accusations that the North Dakota Farmers Union was dominated by Communists led to libel suits against him.

Townley ran for the U.S. Senate from North Dakota as an independent in 1956 and 1958. In 1958, he lost to Republican incumbent William Langer, whose first state office was attorney general on Townley&#x27;s original Non-Partisan League slate in 1916, and who served two terms as governor of North Dakota in the 1930s before leaving the NPL.

== Personal life ==
In Colorado, he met his eventual wife Margaret Rose Teenan, whom he married in 1911. After his wife and foster daughter died in 1944, he lived near New Effington, South Dakota, with a faith-healing group.

Townley was an insurance salesman, trying to raise money to pay his legal bills, when he was killed in a car-truck accident near Minot, North Dakota on November 7, 1959.

<doc id="691927" wikidata="Q6059532" url="?curid=691927" title="Invariant subspace problem">
<text>In the field of mathematics known as functional analysis, the invariant subspace problem is a partially unresolved problem asking whether every bounded operator on a complex Banach space sends some non-trivial closed subspace to itself. Many variants of the problem have been solved, by restricting the class of bounded operators considered or by specifying a particular class of Banach spaces. The problem is still open for separable Hilbert spaces (in other words, each example, found so far, of an operator with no non-trivial invariant subspaces is an operator that acts on a Banach space that is not isomorphic to a separable Hilbert space).

==History==
The problem seems to have been stated in the mid-20th century after work by Beurling and von Neumann, who found (but never published) a positive solution for the case of compact operators. It was then posed by Paul Halmos for the case of operators formula_1 such that formula_2 is compact. This was resolved affirmatively, for the more general class of polynomially compact operators (operators formula_1 such that formula_4 is a compact operator for a suitably chosen non-zero polynomial formula_5), by Allen R. Bernstein and Abraham Robinson in 1966 (see for a summary of the proof).

For Banach spaces, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Per Enflo. He proposed a counterexample to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article&#x27;s complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987 Enflo&#x27;s long &quot;manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians&quot; and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976). Enflo&#x27;s works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Bernard Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo&#x27;s ideas.

In the 1990s, Enflo developed a &quot;constructive&quot; approach to the invariant subspace problem on Hilbert spaces.

In May 2023, a preprint of Enflo appeared on arXiv, which, if correct, solves the problem for Hilbert spaces and completes the picture.

In July 2023, a second and independent preprint of Neville appeared on arXiv, claiming the solution of the problem for separable Hilbert spaces.

In September 2024, a peer-reviewed article published in Axioms by a team of four Jordanian academic researchers announced that they had solved the invariant subspace problem. However, basic mistakes in the proof were pointed out.

==Precise statement==

Formally, the invariant subspace problem for a complex Banach space formula_6 of dimension &gt; 1 is the question whether every bounded linear operator formula_7 has a non-trivial closed formula_1-invariant subspace: a closed linear subspace formula_9 of formula_6, which is different from formula_11 and from formula_6, such that formula_13.

A negative answer to the problem is closely related to properties of the orbits formula_1. If formula_15 is an element of the Banach space formula_6, the orbit of formula_15 under the action of formula_1, denoted by formula_19, is the subspace generated by the sequence formula_20. This is also called the formula_1-cyclic subspace generated by formula_15. From the definition it follows that formula_19 is a formula_1-invariant subspace. Moreover, it is the &quot;minimal&quot; formula_1-invariant subspace containing formula_15: if formula_9 is another invariant subspace containing formula_15, then necessarily formula_29 for all formula_30 (since formula_9 is formula_1-invariant), and so formula_33. If formula_15 is non-zero, then formula_19 is not equal to formula_11, so its closure is either the whole space formula_6 (in which case formula_15 is said to be a cyclic vector for formula_1) or it is a non-trivial formula_1-invariant subspace. Therefore, a counterexample to the invariant subspace problem would be a Banach space formula_6 and a bounded operator formula_7 for which every non-zero vector formula_43 is a cyclic vector for formula_1. (Where a &quot;cyclic vector&quot; formula_15 for an operator formula_1 on a Banach space formula_6 means one for which the orbit formula_19 of formula_15 is dense in formula_6.)
===Known special cases===

While the case of the invariant subspace problem for separable Hilbert spaces is still open, several other cases have been settled for topological vector spaces (over the field of complex numbers):
*For finite-dimensional complex vector spaces, every operator admits an eigenvector, so it has a 1-dimensional invariant subspace.
* The conjecture is true if the Hilbert space formula_6 is not separable (i.e. if it has an uncountable orthonormal basis). In fact, if formula_15 is a non-zero vector in formula_6, the norm closure of the linear orbit formula_19 is separable (by construction) and hence a proper subspace and also invariant.
*von Neumann showed that any compact operator on a Hilbert space of dimension at least 2 has a non-trivial invariant subspace.
* The spectral theorem shows that all normal operators admit invariant subspaces.
* proved that every compact operator on any Banach space of dimension at least 2 has an invariant subspace.
* proved using non-standard analysis that if the operator formula_1 on a Hilbert space is polynomially compact (in other words formula_4 is compact for some non-zero polynomial formula_5) then formula_1 has an invariant subspace. Their proof uses the original idea of embedding the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in a hyperfinite-dimensional Hilbert space (see Non-standard analysis#Invariant subspace problem).
* , after having seen Robinson&#x27;s preprint, eliminated the non-standard analysis from it and provided a shorter proof in the same issue of the same journal.
* gave a very short proof using the Schauder fixed point theorem that if the operator formula_1 on a Banach space commutes with a non-zero compact operator then formula_1 has a non-trivial invariant subspace. This includes the case of polynomially compact operators because an operator commutes with any polynomial in itself. More generally, he showed that if formula_61 commutes with a non-scalar operator formula_1 that commutes with a non-zero compact operator, then formula_61 has an invariant subspace.
*The first example of an operator on a Banach space with no non-trivial invariant subspaces was found by , and his example was simplified by .
*The first counterexample on a &quot;classical&quot; Banach space was found by , who described an operator on the classical Banach space formula_64 with no invariant subspaces.
*Later constructed an operator on formula_64 without even a non-trivial closed invariant &quot;subset&quot;, that is that for every vector formula_15 the &quot;set&quot; formula_20 is dense, in which case the vector is called hypercyclic (the difference with the case of cyclic vectors is that we are not taking the subspace generated by the points formula_20 in this case).
* gave an example of an operator without invariant subspaces on a nuclear Fréchet space.
* proved that any infinite dimensional Banach space of countable type over a non-Archimedean field admits a bounded linear operator without a non-trivial closed invariant subspace. This completely solves the non-Archimedean version of this problem, posed by van Rooij and Schikhof in 1992.
* gave the construction of an infinite-dimensional Banach space such that every continuous operator is the sum of a compact operator and a scalar operator, so in particular every operator has an invariant subspace.

<text>Alexei Shulgin (; born 1963 in Moscow) is a Russian born contemporary artist, musician, and online curator. Working out of Moscow and Helsinki, Shulgin established the Immediate Photography Group in 1988 and started his career in this area of study. After 1990, he shifted his interests from photography to the Internet, and in 1994 founded Moscow-WWW-Art-Lab WWW Art Lab, collaborating with many artists from London and Slovenia. That very same year, Shulgin created an online photo museum called &quot;Hot Pictures&quot;. In 1997, he continued with the invention of Form Art (Form Art) and the introduction of the Easy Life website (Easy Life). In 1999, Shulgin became Webmaster at FUFME, Inc. Since 2004, Shulgin has been a co-owner of Electroboutique (Electroboutique).

==Highlights==
Particularly involved with software art and internet art, he is a part of the readme culture and uses code as a form of art. In 1997, he released his first interactive work, Form Art, in which only minimum factors are programmed in the form of HTML. Navigating this site requires aimless click-throughs of blank boxes and links, which lead the viewer through 19 pages of &quot;form art&quot; animations. Behavioral expectations are subverted by frequently overriding default functionality of basic form elements such as radio buttons and list boxes.

Shulgin is probably most well known for his ongoing so called &quot;386DX&quot; performances, in which he manipulates an antiquated computer with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and an Intel 386 processor to perform MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) renditions of popular music hits while a synthesized text-to-speech voice &quot;sings&quot; the lyrics. Shulgin describes his project, which he began in 1998, of electronic covers as &quot;the world&#x27;s first cyberpunk rock band.&quot; Shulgin and his software have given live performances in many different locales all over the world, from the San Diego/Mexico border, with Shulgin on one side and his computer on the other, to the streets of Graz, Austria, where the machine was actually given money as if it were a real person for playing the music. Shulgin encourages his audience to also manipulate the early Microsoft software- with the self-release of his cover songs on an enhanced cd titled &quot;The Best of 386 DX&quot;, which included the same first version of Windows that he used, followed by the release of &quot;Biggest Smash Hits&quot; on the Staalplaat label.

<text>Jack Rowell OBE (1 November 1936 – 1 July 2024) was an English rugby union coach and executive. He was coach of Bath and England.

==Rugby career==
===Playing===
Rowell played as a Lock for Hartlepool Rovers and Middlesbrough RUFC. He was injured in trials for Oxford University RFC and was recommended not to play again, but restarted playing in his late 20s at Gosforth RFC.

===Coaching===
From 1972 Rowell coached Gosforth, leading them to victory in the John Player Cup in 1975/76 and 1976/77, before his business career took him to the South West.

Between 1978 and 1994 Rowell coached Bath during their golden era, winning eight John Player/Pilkington Cups and five League Championships.

Rowell was the coach of the England rugby team from 1994 to 1997. He took over from Geoff Cooke, announcing that England would give up the forward-dominated, risk-free strategies that had won so many Five Nations Championship titles in the past, instead adopting a &#x27;running rugby&#x27; style. Rowell&#x27;s England won twenty-one of their twenty-nine matches, including the 1995 World Cup quarter-final against Australia. In percentage terms of games won Rowell is England&#x27;s second most successful rugby union coach.

In 2002 he returned to Bath as director of rugby.

===Administration===
In 1998 Rowell became a non-executive director on the board of Bristol, when millionaire businessman Malcolm Pearce saved the club from extinction. In September 2000 he became managing director.

==Business career==
Rowell was Chairman of Celsis plc, Chairman of UK products Ltd which is quoted on AIM and Chairman of Turleigh Ltd, a private company.

He acted as chairman of a number of companies in the public and private sectors, mainly in food. He was previously an executive director on the board of Dalgety plc with responsibility for the consumer foods division.

==Personal life and death==
Rowell was born on 1 November 1936 in Hartlepool. On 1 July 2024, Rowell died at the age of 87.

==Honours==
Rowell was awarded the OBE for services to the game of Rugby Union.

In 1994, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath.
