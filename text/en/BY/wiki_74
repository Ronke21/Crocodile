<doc id="714842" wikidata="Q7311469" url="?curid=714842" title="Relocation of professional sports teams">
<text>Relocation of professional sports teams occurs when a team owner moves a team, generally from one metropolitan area to another, but occasionally between municipalities in the same conurbation. The practice is most common in North America, where a league franchise system is used and the teams are overwhelmingly privately owned. Owners who move a team generally do so seeking better profits, facilities, fan support, or a combination of these.

==North America==

Unlike most professional sport systems worldwide, North America does not have comprehensive governing bodies whose authority extends from the amateur to the highest levels of a given sport. North American sports generally do not operate a system of promotion and relegation in which poorly performing teams are replaced with teams that do well in lower-level leagues.

A city wishing to get a team in a major professional sports league can wait for the league to expand and award new franchises. However, such expansions are infrequent, and generally limited to a narrow window in time. Many current owners believe 32 is the optimal size for a major league due to playoff structure and ease of scheduling. , each of the major leagues has 30 or 32 franchises. The National Hockey League (NHL) has expanded to 32 teams, with the Vegas Golden Knights having become the league&#x27;s 31st team in 2017 and the Seattle Kraken becoming the 32nd team in 2021.

In past decades, aspiring owners whose overtures had been rejected by the established leagues would respond by forming a rival league in hopes that the existing major league would eventually agree to a merger; the new league would attain major league status in its own right; or the established league was compelled to expand. The 1960s American Football League (AFL) is perhaps the most recent example of a successful rival league, having achieved each of the three goals listed above in reverse order. However, all major sports have had a rival league achieve at least some of these goals in the last half of the 20th century. Baseball&#x27;s proposed Continental League did not play a game, but only because Major League Baseball (MLB) responded to the proposal by adding teams in some of the new league&#x27;s proposed cities. The American Basketball Association (ABA) and World Hockey Association (WHA) each succeeded in getting some of their franchises accepted into the established leagues, which had both unsuccessfully attempted to cause their upstart rivals to fold outright by adding more teams.

However, the upstart leagues owed their success in large part to the reluctance of owners in the established leagues to devote the majority of their revenues to player salaries and also to sports leagues&#x27; former reliance primarily on gate receipts for revenue. Under those conditions, an ambitious rival could often afford to lure away the sport&#x27;s top players with promises of better pay, in hopes of giving the new league immediate respect and credibility from fans. Today, however, established leagues derive a large portion of their revenue from lucrative television contracts that would not be offered to an untested rival. Also, the activism of players&#x27; unions has resulted in the established leagues paying a majority of their revenues to players, thus the average salary in each of the big four leagues is now well in excess of $1 million per season.

Under present market and financial conditions, any serious attempt to form a rival league in the early 21st century would likely require hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in investment and initial losses, and even if such resources were made available the upstart league&#x27;s success would be far from guaranteed, as evidenced by the failure of the WWF/NBC-backed XFL in 2001 and the UFL from 2009 to 2012. The current major leagues have established lucrative relationships with all of the major media outlets in the United States, who subsidize the league&#x27;s operations because their established fame ensures strong ratings; the networks are far less willing to provide such coverage to an unproven upstart league, often requiring the upstart league to pay the network for those leagues to be covered.

Therefore, as long as leagues choose not to expand and/or reject a city&#x27;s application, the only realistic recourse is to convince the owner(s) of an existing team to move it (or convince a prospective owner to purchase a team with the intent of moving it). Owners usually move teams because of weak fan support or because the team organization is in debt and needs an adequate population for financial support or because another city offers a bigger local market or a more financially lucrative stadium/arena deal. Governments may offer lucrative deals to team owners to attract or retain a team. For example, to attract the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns in 1995, the state of Maryland agreed to build a new stadium in Baltimore and allow the team to use it rent-free and keep all parking, advertising and concession revenue. (This move proved so unpopular in Cleveland that the move was treated as the Baltimore Ravens being awarded an expansion franchise, and the Browns name and their official lineage would remain in Cleveland for a &quot;reactivated&quot; team that rejoined the NFL three years later.) A little more than a decade earlier, the Baltimore Colts left for Indianapolis (NFL owners voted to give Colts owner Robert Irsay permission to move his franchise to the city of his choosing after no satisfactory stadium would be built).

Moving sports teams is often controversial. Opponents criticize owners for leaving behind faithful fans and governments for spending millions of dollars of tax money on attracting teams. However, since sports teams in the United States are generally treated like any other business under antitrust law, there is little sports leagues can do to prevent teams from flocking to the highest bidders (for instance, the Los Angeles Rams filed suit when the other NFL owners initially blocked their move to St. Louis, which caused the NFL to back down and allow the move to proceed). Major League Baseball, unique among the major professional sports leagues, has an exemption from antitrust laws won by a Supreme Court decision but nonetheless has allowed several teams to change cities. Also recently, courts denied the attempted move of the team then known as the Phoenix Coyotes by siding with the NHL, which claimed that it had final authority over franchise moves.

Newer sports leagues tend to have more transient franchises than more established, &quot;major&quot; leagues, but in the mid-1990s, several NFL and NHL teams moved to other cities, and the threat of a move pushed cities with major-league teams in any sport to build new stadiums and arenas using taxpayer money. The trend continued in the 2000s, when three National Basketball Association (NBA) teams moved in a seven-year span after there were no moves at all in the 16 years before it. Critics referred to the movement of teams to the highest-bidding city as &quot;franchise free agency.&quot;

==Australia and New Zealand==

The two major professional sporting leagues in Australia are the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL). Both competitions were originally based in one city (Melbourne and Sydney respectively) and expanded to a national level, and through that process, there have been team moves, mergers and closures in both leagues. The clubs are owned by members, not privately, but the North American franchise model exists, which means entry to the league is restricted. The hybrid model has meant that the leading promoter of moving is the league itself, trying to grow the football code by encouraging poorly performing clubs to move interstate.

The two most significant relocations in Australian history were the interstate relocations of the South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney (1983:) and the Fitzroy Football Club&#x27;s move of playing operations to Brisbane (1996: ), both ambitious moves due also to crossing the cultural divide known as the Barassi Line.

==Europe==

In Europe, moves are very rare because of the different relationship between clubs and their league in the European system of professional sports league organization. The practice is considered anathema. In most European sports, teams can be relegated from their current league to a lower one or promoted to the one above.

==Latin America and the Caribbean==
Team moves in Latin America occur very rarely for the established teams with established bases. Smaller teams, either small team from large agglomerations or provincial teams with little or no fan base frequently move in search of a larger market and/or more affordable facilities, as frequently, there are only large complexes available with a necessity to groundshare with a larger club. The practice is considered anathema.

===Brazil===
The first move of a first division football team was in 2010. Grêmio Barueri moved to Presidente Prudente, becoming Grêmio Prudente, only to return as Grêmio Barueri in the middle of 2011.

Esporte Clube Dom Pedro II, named after Pedro II of Brazil was founded on February 22, 1996, in Guará. The club moved to Núcleo Bandeirante in 2009, and it was renamed to Esporte Clube Dom Pedro Bandeirante. On November 1, 2016, after achieving promotion back to the first division of the Campeonato Brasiliense, the club changed its name to Real Futebol Clube and moved to Brasília. Ahead of the 2020 campaign, the club again changed name to Real Brasília Futebol Clube.

Guaratinguetá Futebol on October 15, 2010 announced its move from Guaratinguetá to Americana, and their change of name to Americana Futebol. On November 28, 2011, after more than a year in Americana, the club&#x27;s administrator, Sony Sports, announced the team&#x27;s return to Guaratinguetá to compete in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista and other competitions, as Americana city and its main stadium, Estádio Décio Vitta was not able to support the club and the city&#x27;s club, Rio Branco, and also because most of the supports of the club live in Guaratinguetá.

In other sports, such as volleyball, basketball or futsal, moving is more common, although it does not occur frequently.

===Chile===
*Badminton F.C., was a football club based in the city of Santiago, until 1969, when they moved to Curicó, before folding in 1972.
*C.D. Green Cross, founded on June 27, 1916, were a sports club based in the city of Santiago until 1965, when they moved to Temuco and merged with the local football team Deportes Temuco.

===Colombia===
In Colombia historic teams from first division are rarely moved, but newer teams created in second division are often moved from city to city looking for a responding fan base.
*Atlético Juventud, founded in 2007, moved from Soacha to Girardot in 2010, however the club dissolved later that same year, and its affiliation rights were bought by Fortaleza F.C.
*Bajo Cauca F.C. moved to Itagüí in 2008. As a result, the local Itagüí F.C. was refounded. The team was expelled from Itagüí in May 2014, following a dispute between the club&#x27;s chairman and the city&#x27;s mayor regarding the financial support received by the club from Itagüí&#x27;s government. The decision to expel the club from the city was made by the mayor after being publicly criticized by the club&#x27;s chairman for the scarce support provided to the club. This incident meant the team would change its name to Águilas Pereira, moving to the city of Pereira and playing its home matches at Hernán Ramírez Villegas stadium, change approved by DIMAYOR&#x27;s Assembly in an extraordinary meeting on July 14, 2014. In March 2015, the club moved to Rionegro, changing its name to Águilas Doradas and then Rionegro Águilas.
*Centauros Villavicencio in May 2011 moved from Villavicencio to Popayán considering its huge debts, the refusal of financial support from successive local authorities that deemed it as a feeder club for Deportes Quindío, and the support expressed from the Cauca Department Governorate for a football club in the department&#x27;s capital city, thus becoming Universitario Popayán.
*Boyacá Chicó F.C., the 2008–I Colombian champions, started as a Primera B team in Bogotá only to move to Tunja after being promoted to First Division.
*Córdoba F.C., founded in 2006 moved 2 years after its creation from Montería to Sincelejo, and became Atlético de la Sabana. They in turn moved in 2011 to Barranquilla, becoming Uniautónoma FC. At the end of 2015 Uniautónoma, in turn, moved to Palmira and became Orsomarso S.C.
*Dépor F.C. was founded in 2005 in Cartago, Valle del Cauca. For the following year, the club moved to Jamundí, in the same department. During the 2006 and 2008 seasons its home was the Estadio Cacique Jamundí. Due to financial difficulties and the support from Cali&#x27;s public utilities company Emcali, the club was renamed in 2009 and moved from Jamundí to the Aguablanca District in the city of Cali, now playing their home games at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero.
*Deportivo Rionegro, founded in 1957 in Rionegro, being the traditional team of the region of Antioquia, moved to Bello in 2014, being renamed to Leones Fútbol Club, and the following year they moved to Turbo where they stayed for another year before moving to Itagüí in 2016.
*Girardot F.C., founded in 1995, moved from Girardot in 2008 to Palmira, becoming Deportes Palmira. They move did not last as long as they moved a year later to Buenaventura to become Pacífico F.C.

*Univalle F.C. was founded in 1998, playing the first half in Jamundí and the second in Palmira. They were renamed Expreso Palmira in 1991. In 2002, Expreso Palmira was purchased by businessmen who renamed the club Expreso Rojo de Cartegena moving to Cartagena. In 2005 Expreso Rojo moved to Sincelejo, which only lasted a year, and in 2006 returned to Cartagena. In the 2007 season the team moved to the city of Fusagasugá, Cundinamarca. In 2009, the team moved to Zipaquirá due to economic problems. For the 2011 season Expreso Rojo decided to move back to the city of Fusagasugá, however, due to the poor performance the club moved to Soacha. In 2015, the team move back to Zipaquirá. The following season in 2016, the club was renamed as Tigres F.C.

===Costa Rica===
*Founded in 2004 as Brujas de Escazú, when they took over the A.D. Guanacasteca licence to play in the Primera División de Costa Rica, they moved from Nicoya, Guanacaste where they played at the Estadio Chorotega, to Escazú in an attempt to get more support from fans.

===Jamaica===
Hazard United, founded in 1985 in May Pen, moved in 2001 to Clarendon and renamed itself Clarendon United. JFF regulations stipulated that each club have stands to seat at least 1,500, which Clarendon lacked. So the team moved again, to St. Catherine and began to use the Ferdi Neita Sports Complex. Initially, Clarendon and the St. Catherine football club agreed to share the stadium. In 2002, St. Catherine suggested Clarendon change its affiliation to become a St. Catherine team, as the club&#x27;s name was not locally identifiable and the club itself was only slowly gaining followers. Instead, Clarendon moved in 2003 to Portmore and renamed itself Portmore United. The club has since won four Premier League titles.

===Mexico===
Liga MX has a relegation system but its teams have some territorial rights recognized, perhaps due to U.S. influence as many league matches are aired in the U.S., where only traditional top-flight teams are perceived to most effectively reach the immigrant fan-base. 
* In 1971, Cruz Azul moved from Tula de Allende to Mexico City.
* In 2003, Club Necaxa moved from Mexico City to Aguascalientes.

==Asia==
Team moves in Asia are done according to the type of sport played and/or the predominant style of league organization, as well as individual economic circumstances. For instance, in Japan there is a difference between Nippon Professional Baseball which is run like MLB, and the J.League which is run like European football leagues.

Club moves are also common when an amateur or semiprofessional club tries to acquire its own facilities to become a professional club, and no money and/or space is available to build their own in a long-established location.

===China===

Team moves in China are very common. Although China has a European-style promotion and relegation league system, the teams themselves are North American-style franchises, which means the teams are overwhelmingly privately owned and therefore more prone to moving. Owners who move a team generally do so seeking better profits, facilities, fan support, or a combination of these. There are neither rules regarding moves nor many established fan bases, outside a handful of top teams.

===Hong Kong===
*Gansu Tianma F.C. was a football team based in Lanzhou, Gansu, who were relegated to the Yi League in 2004 and sold to Dongguan Dongcheng, who moved the club to the Hong Kong First Division League. The club folded in 2009.

It then moved to Solo in 2000, Cilegon in 2002, Purwakarta in 2006, Bandung in 2008, and Karawang in 2009, before moving back to Bandung in 2012. Throughout those years, the team retained the &quot;Pelita&quot; name until it was rebranded as Persipasi Bandung Raya for the ultimately abandoned 2015 Indonesia Super League, although the club&#x27;s home base was actually in Bekasi at the time. The current iteration of the club began in 2016, ahead of the temporary Indonesia Soccer Championship.

===Iran===
*Saba Qom F.C. was a team based in Qom, Iran, dissolved in 2018. The team was a former part of Saba Battery Club, owned by &quot;Saba Battery Co.&quot;, and was moved to Qom in 2007, although they were formerly registered as a team from Tehran playing at Shahid Derakhshan Stadium of Robat Karim.
*In late May 2007 rumours of the dissolution of Pas Tehran&#x27;s football team began to emerge. It was said that because the city of Tehran has many football teams that have low attendance figures, it would be best for a number of teams to be moved to other cities. On 9 June 2007, Pas Tehran was dissolved. Their right to participate in the Persian Gulf Cup was given to a newly formed team called Pas Hamedan. The staff and players of the football team were move to Hamedan in order to form the team.

The club was moved to Nishapur from May to November 2011, however due to lack of support in Nishapur, the club moved back to Mashhad.
*During the 1980 outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War, Abadan and Khuzestan were heavily hit, which meant the club Sanat Naft Abadan F.C. from 1980 to 1988 was based in Shiraz, returning to Abadan after the war.

===Japan===
====Association football====
The J.League is run similarly to European football leagues. In contrast to the baseball league it has allowed only a few teams to move out of crowded or unprofitable markets:
*The most prominent move was Tokyo Verdy moving from Kawasaki, Kanagawa to Tokyo. 
*Thespa Kusatsu actually plays in the nearby larger city of Maebashi, Gunma because Kusatsu does not have a large stadium. In 2024 they renamed themselves Thespa Gunma to reflect their status as the top team in their prefecture.
*Tokyo Verdy, FC Tokyo, Gamba Osaka and V-Varen Nagasaki play outside their city limits but in due to the specific nature of these large cities the circumstances are for practical reasons. (Nagasaki, which currently plays in nearby Isahaya, is in the process of building a new stadium in Nagasaki city proper.)
*A.C. Nagano Parceiro played in Saku from 2014 to 2015 due to their stadium in Nagano not being fit for J.League football.
*Kyoto Sanga F.C. moved to a football-specific stadium in Kameoka, outside the city of Kyoto, in 2020.

====Baseball====
Nippon Professional Baseball is run in similar fashion to MLB and has moved several franchises out of crowded markets. Moves also happened when the teams changed ownership (which also sometimes involved changing the team name).
*Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters were originally based in Tokyo and moved to Sapporo, Hokkaido in 2004. They moved outside Sapporo to a new stadium in Kitahiroshima in 2023, but did not change their name.
*Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks were originally based in Osaka and moved to Fukuoka in 1988 after Nankai Electric Railway sold the team to Daiei. The team was acquired by SoftBank in 2004 but did not change location.

===South Korea===
====Association football====
Football club moves were frequent in the 1980s and 1990s. South Korea has three national tiers, but as in the North American system, there was initially no promotion or relegation between them.

There were three professional football clubs Ilhwa Chunma (currently Seongnam FC), LG Cheetahs (currently FC Seoul), Yukong Elephants (currently Jeju United) in Seoul by 1995. However, due to K League&#x27;s decentralization policy, these three clubs were forced to move to other cities in 1996, changing their name in the process. These moves are done under the accord that if any of these teams build a football specific stadium in Seoul, they can return there, of which two clubs took advantage of. As a result, the following moves occurred:

* Ilhwa Chunma became Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma based in Cheonan, 95 km away. In 2000, Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma moved from Cheonan to Seongnam, a satellite city of Seoul, 28 km away to become Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma.
* LG Cheetahs became Anyang LG Cheetahs based in Anyang, a satellite city of Seoul, 21 km away. In 2004, Anyang LG Cheetahs returned to Seoul, assuming a small part of the construction costs of the vacant Seoul World Cup Stadium and renamed as FC Seoul.
* Yukong Elephants became Bucheon SK based in Bucheon, a satellite city of Seoul, 25 km away. On February 2, 2006, Bucheon&#x27;s club Bucheon SK was moved by its owner, SK Group, to Jeju Island and the vacant Jeju World Cup Stadium, without notice, and rechristened Jeju United
*In 2003, Sangmu FC, founded in 1984 as the football side of Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps. established a home base in Gwangju at the start of the 2003 season as Gwangju Sangmu FC. The reserve side, Sangmu B, competed in the K2 League from 2003 to 2005 before joining the K League&#x27;s reserve league, and was based in Icheon for the three years it competed at division 2 level. The club&#x27;s hometown was moved from Gwangju to Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do after Gwangju founded the new professional club Gwangju FC in 2011.

====Other sports====
In South Korean major professional sports such as Korea Professional Baseball, Korean Basketball League, V-League, moves were common.

In ice hockey, Mando Winia were a team based in Mok-dong, Seoul, which moved to Anyang, Gyeonggi in 2005 and became Anyang Halla.

===Thailand===
*Prachinburi United F.C. in early 2012 moved to Klaeng District Stadium, Rayong, Rayong Province after moving from Prachinburi Province. They currently play at the Rayong Province Central Stadium.

==Africa==

===South Africa===

In South Africa most football clubs are privately owned, and club moves are relatively common. Several clubs, including top division Premier Soccer League clubs have moved and taken on new identities. There are many other cases of South African moves. The ease of selling and buying of club licences make moves common and sometimes difficult to determine what determines whether a new club represents an existing one that has moved or an entirely separate new entity.

*Hellenic F.C.&#x27;s franchise was sold by the Greek owners in early 2004 to the Ndlovu family, who renamed it Premier United and moved it to Benoni, Gauteng. In 2011, the Hellenic franchise took over the former Blaauwberg City FC, under the management of Mark Byrne. Byrne is looking to revive the quality of the 1970s, to become one of the best youth developments in the country. In 2013, the club acquired a SAB League franchise (South African 4th Division). In August 2016, the club announced that they had sold their SAFA Second Division franchise license to &quot;ensure that we grow from strength to strength in achieving our aim to be the number one youth structure in Cape Town.&quot;
*Khakhu Fast XI initially were founded as an amateur club in 1937, and represented the local city Khakhu, located 170 km northeast of Polokwane. Ahead of the 1998–99 season, the club owner Joseph Mapfulagasha, moved the team about 30 km south to the city Mapate, and at the same time changed the name of the club to Mapate Silver Stars. Silver Stars became Platinum Stars as Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) entered as the club&#x27;s sponsor in 2006 and moved the team to play at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Phokeng. Club name also changed, when RBN bought 51% of the shares in May 2007.
*Makwane Computer Stars were founded in 1977 in a small village of Makwane in an area then known as QwaQwa. They were then renamed Qwa-Qwa Stars before becoming Free State Stars after becoming based at Goble Park in Bethlehem.
*Manning Rangers, based in Durban, declared bankruptcy in 2006. The Fidentia Group purchased the club in 2007 and renamed it the Fidentia Rangers however the new owners moved the club from Durban to Cape Town.
*Nathi Lions was based in KwaMashu, roughly 30 kilometers North of Durban. The team franchise was renamed Atlie FC in 2011 and moved to Ekurhuleni.

<text>This is a list of past arrangements of Canada&#x27;s electoral districts. Each district sends one member to the House of Commons of Canada.

Federal electoral districts in Canada are re-adjusted every ten years based on the Canadian census and proscribed by various constitutional seat guarantees, including the use of a grandfather clause, for Quebec, the Central Prairies and the Maritime provinces, with the essential proportions between the remaining provinces being &quot;locked&quot; no matter any further changes in relative population as have already occurred. Any major changes to the status quo, if proposed, would require constitutional amendments approved by seven out of ten provinces with two-thirds of the population to ratify constitutional changes allowing changes in the existing imbalance of seats between various provinces. During the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, an attempt was made to get around this by adding additional seats. These 30 new seats are the largest increase in the number of seats at any single redistribution since confederation.

<doc id="714845" wikidata="Q752542" url="?curid=714845" title="Aswang">
<text>Aswang is an umbrella term for various shape-shifting evil creatures in Filipino folklore, such as vampires, ghouls, witches, viscera suckers, and transforming human-beast hybrids (usually dogs, cats, pigs). The aswang is the subject of a wide variety of myths, stories, arts, and films, as it is well known throughout the Philippines. Spanish colonists noted that the aswang was the most feared among the mythical creatures of the Philippines, even in the 16th century. Although with no specific motive other than harming others, their behavior can be interpreted as an inversion of the traditional Filipino&#x27;s values. The aswang is especially popular in southern parts of Luzon, and some parts of Mindanao and Visayas, especially the Visayan province of Capiz.

== Historical accounts ==
&quot;The sixth was called &quot;silagan&quot;, whose office it was, if they saw anyone clothed in white, to tear out his liver and eat it, thus causing his death. This, like the preceding, was in the island of Catanduanes. Let no one, moreover, consider this a fable; because, in Calavan, they tore out in this way through the anus all the intestines of a Spanish notary, who was buried in Calilaya by father Fray Juan de Mérida.

The seventh was called &quot;manananggal&quot;, and his purpose was to show himself at night to many persons, without his head or entrails. In such wise the devil walked about and carried, or pretended to carry, his head to different places; and, in the morning, returned it to his body—remaining, as before, alive. This seems to be a fable, although the natives affirm that they have seen it, because the devil probably caused them so to believe. This occurred in Catanduanes.

The eighth they called &quot;osuang&quot;, which is equivalent to &#x27;sorcerer;&#x27; they say that they have seen him fly, and that he murdered men and ate their flesh. This was among the Visayas Islands; among the Tagalos these did not exist.&quot;

Fr. Juan de Plasencia, Customs of the Tagalogs (1589)

== Description and taxonomy ==
According to Maximo Ramos, the term &quot;aswang&quot; can be thought of as an aggregate term for a multitude of Filipino supernatural creatures. These creatures can be organized into five categories that parallel creatures from Western traditions. These categories are the vampire, the self-segmenting viscera sucker, the weredog, the witch, and the ghoul.

=== The vampire ===
The vampire aswang disguises itself in the shape of a beautiful woman. It shares its diet of blood with vampires of Western cultures. However, it differs by sucking blood using a proboscis-like tongue, rather than sharpened teeth. Furthermore, aswang do not live in tombs. Some live in forests far from human communities, but the aswang can infiltrate human society by means of marrying into a community, and either slowly draining their husband of blood, or else using it strictly as a hideout and leaving at night to raid other villages, thereby keeping their cover intact. One example of a vampire aswang is the Tagalog &quot;mandurugo&quot;, said to live in the region of Capiz.

=== The viscera sucker ===
The viscera sucker, also known as &quot;manananggal&quot;, is said to have a diet of internal organs, or the phlegmatic discharge of the sick. Like the vampire aswang, it consumes its food with its tongue, narrow and tubular, but not pointed like the vampire. By day, it takes the shape of an attractive, light-skinned, and long-haired woman. By night, it grows wings and segments itself, leaving behind its body from the waist downwards. It takes great care to hide its lower half, then flies in searches for victims. It is particularly attracted to the fetuses growing inside pregnant women. Viscera suckers are said to live in domiciles deep in the jungle, if not the trees themselves. But like the vampire aswang, most infiltrate human communities via marriage.

=== The weredog ===
Maximo Ramos refers to this category as the weredog, though the creature does not necessarily transform into a dog. Ramos reasons that the werecreature of a given region is named after their most ferocious creature. As such, for example, Europe has werewolves, India has weretigers, and Africa has wereleopards. The Philippines has no indigenous wolf population, thus making weredog the more appropriate term. Like the previous aswang, the weredog infiltrates villages and turns into a creature by night, around midnight. The creature is most commonly a dog, but a cat or pig is also possible. The weredog then kills and eats people, particularly pregnant women on the road in the night, and do not let their long hair hang loose. (Doing so is said to protect against these aswang.) The weredog is said to develop a taste for human flesh by eating food spat on, or licked, by another weredog. (The same is said of the viscera sucker.) Unlike the previous aswang, the weredog does not infiltrate human communities through marriage, but as a traveler of some sort, such as a peddler or a construction labourer.

=== The witch ===

Witch aswang are characterized by extreme vindictiveness, laying curses upon those who have crossed her by making certain objects, such as rice, bones, or insects, come out of the bodily orifices of the cursed. Witches have eyes that reflect images upside down, as well as elongated irises. They live in the outskirts of towns and villages. Witches in the Philippines are feared, avoided and hated. Witches can become aswang, only if they have certain qualities that follow an aswang already. Then they can become an aswang, and by doing so their powers become stronger, stronger than the other witches as well. If an aswang is caught, they are to be immediately killed without question. Though with witches there is just complete avoidance by the people and people around them regard them with fear. Though if an incident were to happen near the witch&#x27;s residence, then there is reason to turn to the witch to blame and punish.

=== The ghoul ===
Ghoul aswang are described as humanoid but generally hidden. Their diet consists of human corpses, they are carrion-eaters. Their nails and teeth are sharp and strong to help with the theft and consumption of the corpses. Their diet makes them smell rank and pungent. They gather in trees near cemeteries to exhume and consume the fresh burials.

== Behaviour ==
Aswang commonly dwell at night in locations such as cemeteries and woods, as their powers are significantly, or sometimes totally, reduced during the daytime. However, despite being described as wild monsters that often live in the wilderness and outskirts of society, aswang are also described as creatures that are capable of living within close proximity of or even within the confines of a village, leading to several reports of aswang attacks within large, populated towns and cities. Their ability to adapt and live within the urban and rural environments populated by humans while still maintaining their feral, monstrous nature is cited as a feature that distinguishes aswang from most other monsters. Aswang also generally have a fear of light. Wakes were often brightly lit to ensure that aswang would not come to the funeral to steal and devour the corpse. They also have a disdain for noise, but rare occasions describe aswang attending noisy parties.

Aswang are traditionally described as one-dimensional monsters and inherently evil by nature with no explicable motives beyond harming and devouring other creatures. Their overtly evil behaviour may be described as an inversion of traditional Filipino values. Traditional aswang have no bias when selecting their prey and will not hesitate to target their own kin: an inversion of the traditional Filipino value of strong kinship and family closeness. Aswang are described to be unclean and favor raw human meat to the food found in traditional Filipino culture. The aswang are also often described to be lewd in behaviour, with female aswang often exposing their genitals to contrast values of traditional modesty.

=== Countermeasures ===
There are several remedies and countermeasures to drive away or slay aswang. The different countermeasures often vary depending on the cultural and symbolic significance of each tool. Holy objects, spices, salt, ash, the tail of a sting-ray, large crustaceans, vinegar, betel nut chew, and urine are all listed as tools for protection against aswang. The reversal of a ladder leading to the house was also said to be a countermeasure against aswang.

Because aswang were believed to be the cause of miscarriages, countermeasures to drive aswang away and prevent them from prowling during childbirth were developed. One method is for the husband of the child-bearing wife to remain under the house naked while furiously waving a sword. Sharp sticks or bolos should be inserted between the bamboos of the house floor to prevent aswang from lurking under the house. Additionally, sick people should not stay in houses with holes and are told not to groan in order not to attract aswang.

There is also a special anti-aswang oil that can be developed. To make this oil, select a particular coconut and watch it grow. Pick it at twilight during a full moon when it is wet and gloomy; the breeze should also be chilly. The coconut should be grated and its juice must be squeezed out. Boil the mixture until it becomes oil. Recite secret prayers and throw all the waste into the ocean so that aswang cannot trace whoever made the oil. Once complete, the oil should be hung at the door of the house; it will boil when an aswang is near.

There are other methods of detecting aswang without the use of the special oil. Scratching noises heard from the ceiling of a house is often a sign of a nearby aswang. Aswang in disguise can be detected by seeing if your reflection in the creature&#x27;s eye is inverted. Additionally, dogs, cats, and pigs with no tails are said to be aswang in disguise. During holy masses, aswang will also attempt to dodge the blessings.

To kill a witch aswang, a bolo knife can be used to strike the middle of the witch&#x27;s back; if that area is not struck, the witch can lick its wounds to heal its injuries. After slaying an aswang with a bolo, the bolo must be planted under the ground. Firearms are not advised for killing aswang and it is useless to stab and slash at an aswang while it is in the form of an animal. Magic prayers can be used to make the aswang vulnerable; while it is in this helpless state, its body must be cut into pieces. If the aswang is cut into two pieces, each piece must be separated and taken to opposite river banks.

== Origins and influences ==
Because of the archipelagic geography of the Philippines, and the primarily oral mode of inheriting and imparting narratives from the past for preservation or didactic purposes, stories about the aswang have evolved and adapted according to the locality in question.

The aswang was born out of Philippine folklore, with stories of this terrifying creature dating back to at least the 16th century, when Spanish explorers created the first written record of the monster. The explorers noted that of all the monsters in their folklore, the aswang was the most feared by native people. 
One of the most famous origins of the term aswang came from the aswang tradition in the Bicol region during the sixteenth century. The Bicolanos believed in the God named Gugurang, who was the good God that acted as the beneficent of their region, the defender and guardian of their homes, and their protector against the evil of the God Asuang. The God Asuang, however, was the evil God and rival, who attempted to always cause harm to Gugurang and found pleasure in doing so. Gugurang was always praised by the Bicolanos, and Asuang shunned and cursed.

However, in another story, Gugurang is portrayed as a fire-wielding God who, if displeased with the humans, would cause Mt. Mayon to erupt. The aswang had no control over the people and became jealous of Gugurang&#x27;s power. As the aswang begged for Gugurang&#x27;s fire, Gugurang felt that the aswang was only trying to have fire to win the favor of the people, and the two began to argue for centuries. But the aswang was able to steal fire by turning himself invisible and hiding the fire in a coconut shell. However, the aswang was unable to control the power and caused the entire world to catch flames. Gugurang followed the flames which led him to the aswang and took the fire back. He called the Gods to help him put out the fire with rain and take revenge on the aswang by making thunder and lightning to strike the mountains. The act brought upon all the evils and destruction in the land, which the people had never forgotten the aswang for.

=== Home of the aswang ===
Aswang are most commonly associated with the province of Capiz, which lies on the island of Panay at the Western Visayas region, so much so that Capiz has come to be dubbed as the creature&#x27;s &quot;hometown&quot;. In an April 29, 2019, documentary of &quot;Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho&quot; (KMJS), aswang are also allegedly sighted in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, which also lies at Western Visayas, where several residents have been reportedly terrorized by the appearance of the aswang at night. The KMJS team tried to substantiate the resident&#x27;s claim by installing cameras to capture the alleged creature, but to no avail.

From the lens of social anthropology, what inspired the legends of the aswang can be traced back to two possible sources: the behaviour of the wildlife within the region, and the prominence of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism within the region.

==== Wildlife behaviour ====
Sounds attributed to the aswang&#x27;s hunting calls (&quot;tiktik&quot; and &quot;wakwak&quot;) are similar to the sounds of nocturnal forest wildlife such as bats and Philippine flying lemurs (which is locally called &quot;kagwang&quot;). The sounds they make have resulted in them being hunted, under the suspicions that these creatures are aswang in disguise.

==== Prominence of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism ====
X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a genetic form of dystonia found almost entirely among males of Filipino descent (XDP Canada). It is also known as the Dystonia of Panay, due to the fact that most current cases today can be traced back to a common ancestor in Panay. According to most recent studies, 93% of current cases today are located on Panay Island, with 63% of those being located in Capiz.

Individuals diagnosed with this disease exhibit debilitating symptoms that put them in a &quot;transforming state&quot;, which results in their &quot;bod[ies] twisting, tongue[s] protruding from their mouth[s], [and] salivating.&quot; With the disorder being endemic to the region for generations, the visible symptoms have been interpreted as a major contribution to the prevalence of narratives surrounding Capiz as the home of the aswang. Individuals afflicted with this disease are branded as aswang and are socially ostracized, which prevent their families from seeking effective medical treatment and forcing them to isolate themselves from the larger community.

=== Influences in contemporary society ===
The folklore of the aswang has been interpreted as having influenced certain idiosyncrasies of the Filipino people. Maximo Ramos, focusing on the ghoul-aspect and viscera-sucker aspect of the aswang, proposes that certain behaviours of modern-day Filipinos can be traced back to older traditions and customs that were geared towards protecting themselves from the aswang. Some of the contemporary behaviours he mentions include:

* The vociferous nature of Filipino gatherings, as compared to the solemn and subdued natures of other ethnic groups. This is most obvious when Filipinos meet with each other in non-Philippine settings.
* The floors are not swept while the dead is lying in state for sweeping the floor would spread the scent of death around the area, which would attract ghouls.
* A chicken whose jugular vein is cut is tossed down the steps and is allowed to flutter away and die while the dead is carried out of the house. The chicken would serve as a distraction for the ghouls.
* In some parts of Luzon, orphans wear red strips of cloth around their wrists, necks, and waists, since red represents fire, a common countermeasure against ghouls. This can explain why &quot;peasant Filipinos&quot; prefer the red clothing which is seen in their dances and in their costumes. (The ghouls have acute hearing but blurred vision.)
* Widows and widowers do not marry for at least a year after the spouse&#x27;s death, for the new spouse may be mistaken for the old one. This fact explains the unpopularity of the recently widowed in tradition-bound communities.
* Phrases meant to identify that the speaker is not an aswang, and to announce ones presence to spirits, are still common in the Philippines.
*In the Philippines in the 1950s the CIA was fighting the Huks, they spread rumours that evil men would be attacked by a local aswang or &#x27;vampire&#x27;. They then punctured holes in the corpse of a Huk and drained all the blood from his body before leaving the body to be discovered on a road. Colonel Edward Lansdale was likely among those who encouraged and spread word of the practice as part of psy-ops against the Huks.

<text>Junín () is a department and region in the central highlands and westernmost Peruvian Amazon. Its capital is Huancayo.

==Geography==


The region has a very heterogeneous topography. The western range located near the border with the Lima Region, has snowy and ice-covered peaks. On the east, there are high glacier valleys which end up in high plateaus (&quot;Altiplano&quot;). Among them is the Junín Plateau that is located between the cities of La Oroya and Cerro de Pasco.

The Mantaro Valley becomes wider before Jauja up to the limit with the Huancavelica Region. This area concentrates a large share of the region&#x27;s population. Towards the east, near the jungle, there is an abundance of narrow and deep canyons, with highly inclined hillsides, covered by woods under low-lying clouds.

The Waytapallana mountain range is located in the south central area of the region. This range holds a great fault which is the reason earthquakes happen in the area. The upper jungle, with valleys of great length, modelled by the Tulumayu, Pawqartampu, Perené and Ene rivers, is located on the eastern side of the region.

Lake Junin, the largest lake entirely within Peru, is located in the region, except for its northernmost tip which belongs to the Pasco Region. Junín Region is also home to Mount Toromocho.

It is rich in minerals, including silver, copper, mercury, bismuth, molybdenum, lead and coal.

===Boundaries===
The Junín Region borders the regions of Pasco in the north, Ucayali in the northeast and Cusco in the east. The Mantaro River marks the border of the region with the Ayacucho and Huancavelica regions in the south and in the west it is bordered by the Lima Region.

===Climate===
The Junín Region has an average annual temperature of 13.1 °C (56 °F), a maximum high of 17 °C (62 °F) and a minimum low of 0 °C (32 °F).

The rainy season runs from November to April, and from December to March in tropical areas.

==Political division==
The region is divided into nine provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 123 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces and their capitals are:

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents was Spanish (86.63%) followed by Quechua (9.29%). The Quechua varieties spoken in Junín are Huanca Quechua (in the Southwest), Yaru Quechua (in the Northwest, especially in Tarma Province). The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Junín Region by province:

== History ==

Until the arrival of the Incas the eastern plains of the Junín region, known in Quechua as &quot;Pampas,&quot; were inhabited by the Yanesha&#x27; and the Asháninka people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and tended to be hostile towards outsiders. Meanwhile, the southwestern Mantaro Valley was inhabited by the Huancas. Sapa Inca Pachacuti conquered this region in 1460, bringing it under the domain of the Inca Empire. Huancayo became the region&#x27;s main highway rest stop on the Inca Trail.

Woolen mills (known in Spanish as &quot;obrajes&quot; or &quot;mills&quot;) were created during the viceroyalty, where the tissue and its craft became a tradition that continues today. On September 13, 1825, Simón Bolívar issued a decree creating what is now the Junín Region, to commemorate his victory in the Battle of Junín, the last real cavalry charge in South America where no shot was fired. Major events of national importance occurred during this period: Huancayo hosted the Assembly that issued the 1839 Constitution and on December 3, 1854, Ramón Castilla signed a decree that granted freedom to Afro-Peruvian slaves.

<text>Poecilia is a genus of fishes in the family Poeciliidae of the order Cyprinodontiformes. These livebearers are native to fresh, brackish and salt water in the Americas, and some species in the genus are euryhaline. A few have adapted to living in waters that contain high levels of toxic hydrogen sulfide () and a population of &quot;P. mexicana&quot; lives in caves (other populations of this species are surface-living).

Some common and widespread species are often kept as aquarium fish, while other have very small ranges and are seriously threatened. Species in &quot;Poecilia&quot; are called &quot;mollies&quot; (e. g. &quot;P. sphenops&quot;) or &quot;guppies&quot; (e. g. &quot;P. reticulata&quot;) depending on body shape.

&quot;Micropoecilia&quot; has been proposed to be included as a subgenus of &quot;Poecilia&quot;.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
&quot;Poecilia&quot; was first proposed as a genus in 1801 by the German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Theaenus Schneider when the described &quot;Poecilia vivipara&quot; as a new species. &quot;P. vivipara&quot; was subsequently designated as the type species of the genus by Pieter Bleeker in 1864. It is the type genus of the subfamily Poeciliinae and of the family Poeciliidae. &quot;Poecilia&quot; refers to the Greek word &quot;poikilos&quot;, which means &quot;variegated&quot; or &quot;speckled&quot;, an allusion to the coloration and pattern of the type species, as well as that of and other related fishes, such as &quot;Fundulus heteroclitus&quot; which Bloch &amp; Schneider classified in this genus.

==Aquaria==
Fish of this genus have extremely variable coloration and have been selectively bred to create many different varieties. The most commonly kept species are guppies (&quot;P. reticulata)&quot;, mollies (&quot;P. sphenops&quot; or &quot;P. latipinna&quot;), and Endler&#x27;s livebearers (&quot;P. wingei&quot;). Members of the genus readily hybridize with each other and so most commercially offered fish are hybrids (with guppies having some Endler, and mollies being a mix of common and sailfin mollies).

They are easy to sex as males have a prominent gonopodium, a modified anal fin used to inseminate females. They mature quickly and breed readily, with females giving birth to a dozen or more fry every month. Some poecilids are cannibalistic and will eat any of their fry that are unable to flee in time (with females often eating the fry they just gave birth to, especially in a cramped aquarium setting).

==Species==
The 41 currently recognized species in this genus are:

<text>The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two, two guard or off guard, is one of the five traditional positions in a regulation basketball game. A shooting guard&#x27;s main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from to while in the WNBA, shooting guards tend to be between and .

== Characteristics and styles of play ==
&quot;The Basketball Handbook&quot; by Lee Rose describes a shooting guard as a player whose primary role is to score points. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are good long-range shooters, typically averaging 35–40 percent from three-point range. Many shooting guards are also strong and athletic, and have the ability to get inside the paint and drive to the basket.

Typically, shooting guards are taller than point guards. Height at the position varies; many bigger shooting guards also play small forward. Shooting guards should be good ball handlers and be able to pass reasonably well, though passing is not their main priority. Since good shooting guards may attract double-teams, they are frequently the team&#x27;s back-up ball handlers to the point guard and typically get a fair number of assists.

Shooting guards must be able to score in various ways, especially late in a close game when defenses are tighter. They need to have a good free throw percentage too, to be reliable in close games and to discourage opposing players from fouling. Because of the high level of offensive skills shooting guards need, they are often a team&#x27;s primary scoring option, and sometimes the offense is built around them.

In the NBA, there are some shooting guards referred to as &quot;3 and D&quot; players. The term 3 and D implies that the player is a good 3 point shooter who can also play effective defense. The 3 and D player has become very important as the game sways to be perimeter oriented.

Good shooting guards can often play point guard to a certain extent. It is usually accepted that point guards should have the ball in their hands at most times in the game, but sometimes the shooting guard has a significant enough influence on the team where they handle the ball extremely often, to the point where the point guard may be reduced to a backup ball handler or a spot-up shooter, a player who &quot;spots-up&quot; for catch-and-shoot shots to provide spacing for the offense. Notable shooting guards include Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Manu Ginobili, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Tracy McGrady, Joe Dumars, Clyde Drexler, Jerry West, Sam Jones, Donovan Mitchell, Allen Iverson, and Anthony Edwards in the NBA and Diana Taurasi, Chelsea Gray, Jewell Loyd, Seimone Augustus, Cynthia Cooper, and Cappie Pondexter in the WNBA.

== Skills and qualities ==
It is important for a shooting guard to develop skills in defense, passing and strength in addition to shooting ability. This position displays the most movement offensively when trying to get an open shot, along with keeping things under control on the defensive end.

Understanding that this position is shaped around the shooting ability of the athlete, many external abilities implemented into the player will overall help construct the potential the athlete possesses. External abilities would consist of strong ball handling, a sharp mind, and the development of a high basketball intelligence.

Shooting guards are often used as the secondary ball handler to help eliminate pressure of the 1 guard.

<text>To the Struggle Against World Terrorism (also known as the Tear of Grief and the Tear Drop Memorial) is a 10–story sculpture by Zurab Tsereteli that was given to the United States as an official gift from the Russian government as a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It stands at the end of the former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey. Ceremonial groundbreaking occurred on September 16, 2005, in a ceremony attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The monument was dedicated on September 11, 2006, in a ceremony attended by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.

==Design==
The sculpture comprises a bronze-clad tower split with a jagged opening in the middle, in which hangs a -tall nickel-surfaced teardrop. The eleven sides of the monument&#x27;s base bear granite name plates, on which are etched the names of those who died in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. However, like some other 9/11 memorials, the dedication was based on an outdated compilation and contains about forty people who were removed from later victim listings.

Tsereteli did not disclose the cost of the sculpture except to say that he paid for labor and materials. A lawyer for the sculptor released the cost at about $12 million. Tsereteli said metals for the sculpture were obtained &quot;From a military factory that did airplanes. In Dzerzhinsk. A secret city.&quot;

==Further information==
The monument was initially given to the local government of Jersey City, but was rejected. It was then relocated to its present placement in Bayonne. In August 2010 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced it had plans to build a container facility on the location and the monument would most likely have to be moved. However, Robert &quot;Captain Bob&quot; Terzi, a Bayonne taxi driver started an online petition to prevent the relocation. 

It was listed as one of the world&#x27;s ugliest statues by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, while &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said that it looked like &quot;a giant tea biscuit&quot; from a distance. Pro Arts Jersey City called it &quot;an insensitive, self-aggrandizing piece of pompousness by one of the world&#x27;s blatant self-promoters&quot;.

In September 2011, a section of steel from the World Trade Center was placed adjacent to the sculpture.

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city of Bayonne had Vladimir Putin&#x27;s name covered on the two plaques in the park.

<doc id="714878" wikidata="Q205126" url="?curid=714878" title="Department of La Libertad">
<text>La Libertad (; in English: The Liberty) is a department and region in northwestern Peru. Formerly it was known as the Department of La Libertad (&quot;&quot;). It is bordered by the Lambayeque, Cajamarca and Amazonas regions on the north, the San Martín Region on the east, the Ancash and Huánuco regions on the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Its capital is Trujillo, which is the nation&#x27;s third biggest city. The region&#x27;s main port is Salaverry, one of Peru&#x27;s largest ports. The name of the region is Spanish for &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty&quot;; it was named in honor of the Intendancy of Trujillo&#x27;s proclaiming independence from Spain in 1820 and fighting for that. It is the ninth smallest department in Peru, but it is also its second-most populous department after Piura and its second-most densely populated department after Lambayeque.

==Name==

During the viceroyalty of Peru, the La Libertad region, together with the present-day regions of Lambayeque, Piura and Tumbes regions in Peru, and Guayaquil and El Oro Province in Ecuador, were all within the jurisdiction of the Intendancy of Trujillo. These were included in the domain of the city of Trujillo; together they comprised the &quot;Departamento de Trujillo&quot; of the viceroyalty.

After the intendancy joined the emancipation cause and was the first to gain independence from Spain as the Department of Trujillo, in 1825 the Congress of the Peruvian republic changed the name to &quot;Departmento de la Libertad.&quot; Since the late 20th century, Peru has decentralized its government. All former Departments in Peru are now called Regions; their governors are elected, and they have more independent authority in decisionmaking.

==Geography==
La Libertad is the only Peruvian region that includes all three natural regions of the nation: coast, Sierra (highlands), and &quot;selva&quot; (rainforest).

Trujillo, the capital, has a strategic location, near where the Andes come closest to the coast. Seen from Trujillo, the Andes appears as a row of low-elevation hills. The Andean Plateau increases altitude sharply to the east, in the provinces of Otuzco and Santiago de Chuco. These two provinces comprise the Pacific hydrographic watershed, which give rise to the Moche and Virú rivers, to the south, and Chicama River to the north. Pacasmayo Province, located more to the north, is along the coast. To the east, Sánchez Carrión Province waterways drain into the Amazon River and thus belong to the Atlantic Ocean watershed.

==Demographics==

===Population===
La Libertad region is the third-most populous in Peru; the census 2007 recorded 1,617,050 residents, representing 5.9% of the Peruvian population. It was surpassed only by the Department of Lima and Piura. In 2012 its capital Trujillo is the second-most populated metropolitan area in Peru and the largest city in northern Peru. The largest population is concentrated in provincial capitals and districts, which comprise the majority urban population in La Libertad region. The migrant population to the region comes from border departments and immigrants from other countries.

===Principal cities===
The principal cities in La Libertad region are shown in the next table.

==Political division==

The Region is separated into 12 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;), political divisions that generally correspond to counties in the United States of America. A Peruvian Region has as its head political executive a governor (&quot;governador&quot;), an elected official. The head political executive of each province is a lieutenant governor (&quot;teniente governador&quot;), an official appointed by the governor. These 12 provinces comprise a total of 80 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals are:

==Economy==

===Principal companies===
Some of the main companies in La Libertad Region are the following:
*Cementos Pacasmayo. It manufactures cement and it is based in Pacasmayo Province.
*Sociedad Agrícola Virú, dedicated to agribusiness and based in Virú Province
*SEDALIB, water supply and sanitation company based in Trujillo city
*Caja Trujillo, banking company centered in Trujillo
*Cesar Vallejo University, based in Víctor Larco city

==Archaeology==
The coastal strip set the stage for the rise of many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the pre-Ceramic Huaca Prieta civilization, which is more than 5,000 years old &amp; the Cupisnique, which is more than 3,000 years old. From 200 A.C., the first one to expand beyond its cradle was the Moche or Mochica culture. It was basically an agriculture and/or a warrior culture, which built countless temples and palaces such as the &quot;Sol&quot; (Sun), &quot;Luna&quot; (Moon), &quot;El Brujo&quot; &amp; &quot;Cao Viejo&quot;, and other huacas. The Chimú culture emerged later and built its capital in Chan Chan, the largest pre-Columbian city in South America, &amp; huacas like &quot;Esmeralda&quot; &amp; &quot;Arco Iris&quot; (Rainbow). At its zenith, Chan Chan was home to 60,000 inhabitants who stubbornly resisted the expansion of the Inca Empire. These ancient cultures used irrigation canals and water reservoirs, which systems were increasingly better engineered and extensive over the years. The technological acumen of these sophisticated agricultural systems was carried into the Inca Empire, which surrounded the remnants of the prior cultures. The Spanish colonizers destroyed most of the agricultural works to more effectively establish political control and provide &quot;de facto&quot; slave labor from the displaced native agriculturalists.

The archaeological remains of Chan Chan, 6 km (3.7 mi) northeast of downtown Trujillo, are rather well-preserved despite being built out of adobe (mud bricks), largely because 1) dearth of rainfall and consequent erosion, and 2) lack of significant re-use of its construction materials (adobes do not respond easily to removal and transport and are relatively cheap to make on-site in current methods of construction).

During the Late Moche phase (AD 600 to 850), one of the largest power centers of the region was the fortified site of Cerro Chepén in the Jequetepeque Valley. It is located to the south of the site of San José de Moro.

Cerro Chepén has a sophisticated system of fortifications, and a dominant position on top of the hill, with many monumental buildings. Recent excavations at the site revealed that there was much internal conflict there that affected local communities.

===Archeological sites===
Some of the archeological sites in La Libertad Region are:
*Chan Chan
*El Brujo
*Huaca del Sol
*Huaca de la Luna
*Marcahuamachuco
*Pacatnamu
*Pirqa Pirqa
*San José de Moro
*Huaca Santa Clara
*Wiraquchapampa
*Archeological Complex Caballo Muerto

==Places of interest==
* Calipuy National Sanctuary

==Ecological regions==

==Water supply and sanitation==
The public company for water supply and sanitation in La Libertad Region is SEDALIB which is formed by shareholders of municipalities of the Region.

==Culture==

===Festivals and events===
*Spring Festival
*Marinera Festival
*International Calzaferia El Porvenir. It is a fair of footwear and in 2012 took place the 10th edition; it is held in &quot;El Porvenir&quot; city.
*Regional Fair of the Pineapple. It is held in the town of Poroto.
*Virgin of La Puerta. Patronal Feast; the celebration originated in 1664 when it placed the image of the Virgin at the entrance of Otuzco as precaution of the risk of a pirate raid. The main day is celebrated on December 15 every year and in 2012 the feast of Our Lady of the Gate was declared a National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.
*Contradanza. Expression cultivated in Huamachuco city, in the villages Urpay, Shiracmaca and Culicanda. This dance in 2012 has been declared a National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.

<doc id="714889" wikidata="Q838913" url="?curid=714889" title="Jump shot (basketball)">
<text>In basketball (and derivatives like netball), a player may attempt to score a basket by leaping straight into the air, the elbow of the shooting hand cocked, ball in hand above the head, and launching the ball in a high arc towards the basket for a jump shot (colloquially, a jumper). Although early critics thought the leap might lead to indecision in the air, the jump shot replaced the earlier, less quickly released &quot;set shot&quot;, and eventually transformed the game because it is the easiest shot to make from a distance and more difficult for a defender to block. Variations on the simple jump shot include the &quot;turnaround jumper&quot; (facing away from the basket, then jumping and spinning towards it, shooting the ball in mid-air); the &quot;fadeaway&quot; (jumping &quot;away&quot; from the basket to create space); and the &quot;leaning jumper&quot; (jumping towards the basket to move away from a trailing defender). With the &quot;hook shot,&quot; a player is turned sideways with the shooting arm away from the basket outstretched so that with a sweep he can launch the ball over his head. Since a defender must leap to block a jumper, the shooter may use a pump fake to get the defender in the air at the wrong time and so have a clear shot. If the shooter leaps into the defender, a foul is called on the defensive player, whereas the shooter is awarded two or three free throws according to the value of a missed attempt, or a single free throw.

== Technique ==
Though techniques differ from player to player, coaches and instructors stress &quot;BEEF&quot; when shooting: Balance, Eyes, Elbows, &amp; Follow Through. Because players have different builds, play styles, and individual preferences, not every player strictly adheres to this form.

When performing the jump shot maneuver, balance is paramount. While elite shooters like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson can get off shots from a myriad of angles, a solid base—one with feet pointed towards the basket—greatly increases the chance of making the shot: &quot;[p]roficient free throw shooters had greater knee and elbow flexion&quot;. A strong base that uses legs and core improves the chances the jump shooter will have of making a shot from distance—using legs and core to spring up will get the player enough power to get the ball in the basket. Eyes locked on the rim, shooters know what to aim for; some players elect to aim for the front of the rim, some the back. The elbow is considered the make-or-break aspect of a shooting form— having the elbow straight and in line with the rim keeps the ball on target, according to Steve Kerr. The shooting hand should be cocked onto the ball; when raising arms to shoot, the shooting arm should form an angle between 45º and 90º with the elbow straight. Following through on the shot puts rotation, or spin, on the ball to keep it on its trajectory. This is done by flicking the wrist and pointing fingers down.

Debate still continues as to who invented the jump shot. In the NCAA collegiate archives, John Miller Cooper, who played at the University of Missouri in the 1930s, is recognized as the person to hoist the first jump shot. However, John Christgau, in &quot;The Origins of the Jump Shot&quot;, makes a strong case that Ken Sailors did so in May 1934. Sailors went on to play for the University of Wyoming and was selected as MVP of their 1943 NCAA Championship team. Sailors also played for five different teams in the old American Basketball League. Other people that Christgau credits with the jump shot are Glen &quot;Glenn&quot; Roberts, Myer &quot;Whitey&quot; Skoog, John &quot;Mouse&quot; Gonzales, Bud Palmer, Davage &quot;Dave&quot; Minor, “Jumping” Joe Fulks, Johnny Adams, and Belus Smawley. Hank Luisetti is credited with popularizing the jump shot. Paul Arizin popularized the running jump shot.

== Advancement ==
In the last ten years, the National Basketball Association has seen an increase in the percentage of three-pointers taken. With this increase —from 22% in 2011 to 39% in 2021—, the percentage of “deep twos”, or midrange jump shots, has decreased. The advent of “small ball” encourages a spread-out, open offense, lending itself to more perimeter shots.

With more guards and hybrid, utilitarian position-less players on the floor, shooting more jump shots is incorporated into game strategies by coaches. Traditionally, methodical half court offenses used to swing the ball around, pass it to the big man, who might score inside by sheer strength or footwork grace. Now, the game of basketball as a whole employs a more fast-paced, playstyle that emphasizes passing and perimeter (three point) based offenses.

As result, taller players are more comfortable shooters than their similarly statured predecessors. When a larger player is adept at shooting, they are known as a stretch four, as they stretch the floor by pulling their larger (interior) defender out on the perimeter. This opens up driving lanes for other players to attack the rim. Players like Dirk Nowitzki (right) break the mold of a traditional 7-footer; 40 years ago, Nowitzki would have been required to put on weight and become a heavyweight center, but his versatile offensive repertoire allowed him and Steve Nash to change the way opposing defenses guarded the pick and roll. Nowitzki had the ability to &quot;pick and pop&quot;, spacing the floor for his teammates.

<doc id="714896" wikidata="Q210061" url="?curid=714896" title="Department of Lambayeque">
<text>Lambayeque () is a department and region in northwestern Peru known for its rich Moche and Chimú historical past. The region&#x27;s name originates from the ancient pre-Inca civilization of the &quot;Lambayeque&quot;. It is the second-smallest department in Peru after Tumbes, but it is also its most densely populated department and its eighth most populous department.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Lambayeque&quot; is a Spanish derivation of the god &quot;Yampellec&quot;, said to have been worshipped by the first Lambayeque king, &quot;Naymlap&quot;. The Spanish gave the name to the early people.

==Geography==

The vast plains that make up the department of Lambayeque&#x27;s territory are watered by rivers that originate in the Andes; cultivation is only possible in a small portion of this parched region with irrigation. The fertile river valleys produce half of the sugar cane crop of Peru. In addition, Lambayeque and the department of Piura provide most of the rice crops consumed in Peru.

Increased agricultural harvest is expected with completion of the Olmos Transandino Project. The water supply project will transfer up to 2 billion m3 annually of water from the Huancabamba River in the department of Cajamarca east of Lambayeque.

In the smaller scale farming of earlier centuries, the Olmos Carob Tree Forest supported goat herds that fed on carobs. The fine goatskins were tanned to create the fine, pale, leather known as &quot;cordoban&quot; or &quot;cordovan&quot;, from the Spanish town of Córdoba, where the process was developed. Goat fat was used to make soap.

There are two small islands off the Pacific coast of the department of Lambayeque: Lobos de Afuera, and Lobos de Tierra; there was a dispute with the department of Piura over ownership of the latter island.

The region is bordered by the Piura Region on the north, the Cajamarca Region on the southeast, the La Libertad Region on the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west.

==History==

Legend tells that in ancient times, a great float of balsa rafts arrived at the beaches of the existing San José cove. Formed by a brilliant cortege of nine foreign warriors, this float was led by a man of great talent and courage, named Naymlap, the mythical founder of the first northwest civilization.

Among the descendants of Naymlap were the Moche and the Chimú, the latter builders of a great civilization forged in Lambayeque before being conquered by the later Inca Empire. The Chimú grew to acquire a notable state parallel to the Inca. The Chimú moved their capital to the northern area, establishing great urban centers there. They were great farmers, textile experts and, wonderful goldsmiths, with extraordinary works in gold. 

The Inca conquest of what today is Lambayeque, lasted almost four decades. Pachacuti, Tupac Inca Yupanqui and Huayna Cápac, successively, ruled during the process.

In the 16th century, the Spaniard leader Francisco Pizarro took his conquistadors across the region on the way to Cajamarca to conclude the defeat of the Inca empire. He was amazed by the gold exposed in vases and utensils.

During Colonial times, a rivalry started between the people of the towns of Lambayeque and Santiago de Miraflores de Saña. The reason of the conflict was the opulence in which the latter lived, even provoking the greed of pirates. A flood in 1720, however, destroyed Saña and marked the end of a flourishing city.

The people of Lambayeque followed Juan Manuel Iturregui as their leader in the struggles for emancipation and independence from Spain. He spread the libertarian ideas and helped get arms for the cause.

=== Archaeology ===
In November 2019, Peruvian archaeologists led by Walter Alva discovered a 3,000-year-old, 130 feet long megalithic &#x27;water cult&#x27; temple with 21 tombs in the Oyotún district in the Zaña Valley. Archaeologists assumed that the temple was abandoned around 250 BC and later used as a burial ground by the Chumy people. Twenty of the tombs belonged to the people of Chumy, and one to an adult male buried during the Formative period with a ceramic bottle with two spouts and a bridge handle. According to the excavations, as many as three construction phases took place in the temple: the first was between 1500 BC–800 BC, when people built the foundations of the building from cone-shaped clay; second, between 800 BC–400 BC, when the megalithic temple was built under the influence of the pre-Inca civilization known as the Chavin; and finally 400 BC–100 BC, when people added circular pillars used to hold the roof of the temple.
==Political division==

The department is divided into 3 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 38 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

* Chiclayo (Chiclayo)
* Ferreñafe (Ferreñafe)
* Lambayeque (Lambayeque)

== Places of interest ==
* Pómac Forest Historical Sanctuary
* Tucume Pyramids

== Music from Lambayeque ==

The most famous composer from Lambayeque was Luis Abelardo Nuñez, born in Ferreñafe on 22 November 1926. His songs are among the most popular ones in Peruvian music. These included the following:

* &quot;Marinera norteña&quot;, Los Troveros Criollos
* Waltz: &quot;Porqué no volverás?&quot;
* Waltz: &quot;Embrujo&quot;

<text>The Department of Lima (), known as the Department of the Capital () until 1823, is a department and region located in the central coast of Peru; the seat of the regional government is Huacho.

Lima Province, which contains the city of Lima, the country&#x27;s capital, is located west of the department; this province is autonomous and not under the jurisdiction of the regional government since 2003.

==History==

The remains of early Andean inhabitants, hunters and harpoon fishermen from more than 6500 years ago, are to be found in the department of Lima. These remains were found in Chivateros, near the Chillón River, and in various other places. These persons incorporated nets, hooks, farming, ceramics and weaving to their everyday objects. The inhabitants of the coast lived in the &quot;lomas&quot; and the valleys, where they built temples and dwelling complexes, leading to huge ceremonial centres, such as the Huacoy on the Chillón River; Garagay and La Florida on the Rímac River, Manchay on the Lurín River; and Chancay, Supe and many other valleys to the north and south. There are finely ornamented temples with figures modelled in clay.

Lithic prehistoric projectile points of Paijan type were found at Ancón, 40 kilometres northeast of Lima in the Chillón River Valley.

The 5,000-year-old ruins known as El Paraíso are also located in this area. A temple at the site is believed to be about 5,000 years old.

From 1784 to 1821, the area was administered as the Intendancy of Lima. After independence, its northern area was administered as the Department of the Coast. When the department was created in 1821 as the &quot;Department of the Capital&quot;, the aforementioned department was annexed into it in 1823.

In 2006, a team of archeological researchers led by Robert Benfer announced their findings from a four-year excavation at Buena Vista in the Chillón River valley a few kilometres north of present-day Lima. They had discovered a 4200-year-old observatory constructed by an early Andean civilization, a three-dimensional sculpture, unique for the time period in this region, and sophisticated carvings. The observatory is on top of a 10-meter pyramidal mound and has architectural features for sighting the astronomical solstices. The discovery pushes back the time for the development of complex civilisation in the area and has altered scholars&#x27; understanding of Preceramic period cultures in Peru.

The Lima culture (100 A.D. to 650 A.D.) arose in this area, specially in the central valleys from Chancay to Lurín. It was distinguished by painted adobe buildings.

During this time, the Huari conquest took place, thus giving rise to Huari-style ceramics, together with a local style known as Nievería. As the population grew, their culture changed. With the decline of the Huari, whose most important center was Cajamarquilla, new local cultures arose. The Chancay are the most well-known. They developed large urban centers and a considerable textile production, as well as mass-produced ceramics.

At this stage in the mid-15th century, the Incas arrived from their base in the Andes. They conquered and absorbed the regional cultures and occupied important sites such as Pachacamac, turning it into an administrative centre.

== Political divisions ==
The department is divided into nine provinces, which are composed of 171 districts.

*Barranca (Barranca)
*Cajatambo (Cajatambo)
*Cañete (San Vicente de Cañete)
*Canta (Canta)
*Huaral (Huaral)
*Huarochirí (Matucana)
*Huaura (Huacho)
*Oyón (Oyón)
*Yauyos (Yauyos)

==Geography==

The department of Lima is bordered by the departments of Ancash on the north, Huánuco, Pasco, and Junín on the east, Huancavelica on the southeast, Ica on the south, and the Pacific Ocean and the Lima Province on the west.

The department has a coastal and an Andean zone, and has a great diversity of natural regions: the Coast or &quot;Chala&quot; (0 to 500 meters above sea level) up to the &quot;Janka&quot; or &quot;Mountain range&quot; (, over 4800 meters). The predominating regions are the &quot;Yunga&quot; (500 to 2300 meters above sea level) and &quot;Quechua&quot; (2300 to 3500 meters)

==Points of interest==
Points of interest in the department include Caral, Lachay National Reserve and Nor Yauyos-Cochas Landscape Reserve.

===Lachay National Reserve===

The Lachay National Reserve, in the Huaura province, is a unique mist-fed eco-system of wild plant and animal species, is a natural reserve located in the north of the department.

=== Huacho - The capital of the Lima Region ===
Huacho is the capital of the Lima Region and the most populous city of the department (excluding Lima which is administered by an autonomous government, the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima). Sitting at the bottom of a wide bay, it has a pleasant and dry climate. In its vicinity is the Huaura River where rice, cotton, sugar cane and different fruits and cereals are grown. This has given rise to an important cotton industry as well as soap and oil factories.

===Lunahuaná===
Lunahuaná District of Cañete Province, is located away from the south city of San Vicente de Cañete. The Incahuasi Archeological complex is located there. Lunahuaná has a dry climate and the sun shines during most of the year. Lately, Lunahuaná has become an adventure sports paradise, such as: &quot;Canotaje&quot; (Whitewater Rafting), &quot;Parapente&quot; &amp; &quot;Ala Delta&quot;. Whitewater rafting is possible due to the Cañete River, which has rapids up to level 4. The main settlement in this district is the town of Lunahuaná.

<text>John Dominis (June 27, 1921 – December 30, 2013) was an American documentary photographer, war photographer and photojournalist.

== Life ==
Dominis was born 1921 in Los Angeles. He studied cinematography at the University of Southern California. In 1943 he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, he worked as a freelance photographer for several publications, such as &quot;Life&quot; magazine. In 1950 he went to Korea as a war photographer in the Korean War.
Later he worked in Southeast Asia, in America, Africa and Europe, including President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 West Berlin speech. Dominis went to six Olympic Games. One of his best-known pictures was shot during the 1968 Summer Olympics, when Dominis pictured Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their Black Power salute.

Dominis worked for &quot;Life&quot; magazine during the Vietnam War and later also went to Woodstock. In the 1970s he worked for &quot;People&quot; magazine. From 1978 to 1982 he was an editor for the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He often pictured stars like Steve McQueen or Frank Sinatra, and these photo series were later published as illustrated books. Together with Giuliano Bugialli he published several books about the Italian cuisine, with Dominis being responsible for the food photography.

In John Loengard&#x27;s book &quot;Life Photographers: What They Saw&quot;, Dominis reported about the staging of his picture &quot;A leopard about to kill a baboon&quot;. The picture was shot in 1966 in Botswana when a hunter had brought a captured leopard to a bunch of baboons. Most fled immediately but one faced the leopard and was killed subsequently. Dominis was heavily criticized after the staging became public and apologized for it. He mentioned that during the 1960s the staging of pictures was very popular and he wouldn&#x27;t use this method today.

Dominis died December 30, 2013, in New York City of complications from a heart attack. He was 92.

<doc id="714908" wikidata="Q740445" url="?curid=714908" title="Ridge">
<text>A ridge is a long, narrow, elevated geomorphologic landform, structural feature, or a combination of both separated from the surrounding terrain by steep sides. The sides of a ridge slope away from a narrow top, the crest or ridgecrest, with the terrain dropping down on either side. The crest, if narrow, is also called a ridgeline. Limitations on the dimensions of a ridge are lacking. Its height above the surrounding terrain can vary from less than a meter to hundreds of meters. A ridge can be either depositional, erosional, tectonic, or a combination of these in origin and can consist of either bedrock, loose sediment, lava, or ice depending on its origin. A ridge can occur as either an isolated, independent feature or part of a larger geomorphological and/or structural feature. Frequently, a ridge can be further subdivided into smaller geomorphic or structural elements.

== Classification ==
As in the case of landforms in general, there is a lack of any commonly agreed classification or typology of ridges. They can be defined and classified on the basis of a variety of factors including either genesis, morphology, composition, statistical analysis of remote sensing data, or some combinations of these factors.

An example of ridge classification is that of Schoeneberger and Wysocki, which provides a relatively simple and straightforward system that is used by the USA National Cooperative Soil Survey Program to classify ridges and other landforms. This system uses the dominant geomorphic process or setting to classify different groups of landforms into two major groups, &quot;Geomorphic Environments&quot; and &quot;Other Groupings&quot; with a total of 16 subgroups. The groups and their subgroups are not mutually exclusive; landforms, including ridges, can belong to multiple subgroups. In this classification, ridges are found in the Aeolian, Coastal Marine and Estuarine, Lacustrine, Glacial, Volcanic and Hydrothermal, Tectonic and Structural, Slope, and Erosional subgroups.

=== Aeolian ridge ===
;Aeolian dune ridge: An aeolian dune ridge is a ridge of sand piled up by the wind. A sand dune can be either a hill or ridge of sand piled up by the wind. A single sand dune can range in length from less than one meter to several tens of kilometers, their height can vary from a few tens of centimeters to a 150 meters. &quot;Megadunes&quot; or &quot;draas&quot; are very large dunes, which can have smaller dunes superimposed on them.

=== Coastal ridges ===
;Beach ridge: A beach ridge is a low, essentially continuous ridge of beach or beach-and-dune sediments piled up by the action of waves and currents on a shoreline beyond the present limit of storm waves and the reach of ordinary tides. They occur occurring singly or as one of a series of approximately parallel ridges that are roughly parallel to the shoreline.

=== Erosional ridges ===
;Dendritic ridge: In typical dissected plateau terrain, the stream drainage valleys will leave intervening ridges. These are by far the most common ridges. These ridges usually represent slightly more erosion resistant rock, but not always – they often remain because there were more joints where the valleys formed or other chance occurrences. This type of ridge is generally somewhat random in orientation, often changing direction frequently, often with knobs at intervals on the ridge top.

;Strike ridge: A strike ridge is an asymmetric ridge created by the differential erosion of a hard, erosion-resistant, dipping layer of rock sandwiched between layers of weaker, more easily eroded rock. A strike ridge has a distinctly gentler sloping side (dip slope), that roughly parallels the inclined layer of erosion-resistant rock. The opposite side of a strike ridge is relatively short, steep or cliff-like slope (scarp slope) that cuts across the tilted layers of rocks. In foldbelts such as the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, they form series of long, parallel, straight to arcuate ridges. Strike ridges are subdivided into cuestas, flatirons, homoclinal ridges, and hogbacks.

;Reef: A term applied by early explorers and settlers in the western United States to ridges that formed a rocky barrier to land travel, by analogy with ocean reefs as barriers to sea travel. Examples include Capitol Reef National Park and the San Rafael Reef. The usage may have originated with sailors during the Australian gold rushes to describe the gold-bearing ridges of Bendigo, Australia.
=== Glacial ridges ===
;Moraines and eskers: Glacial activity may leave ridges in the form of moraines and eskers. An arête is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.

;Pressure ridge (ice): An ice pressure ridge is a ridge of deformed ice along the boundaries of individual ice floes when the ice floes on a lake or ocean collide and compress their edges. The average height of a sea ice pressure ridge is between 5 and 30 meters.

=== Tectonic and Structural ridges ===
;Oceanic spreading ridge: In tectonic spreading zones around the world, such as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the volcanic activity forms new land between tectonic boundaries creating volcanic ridges at the spreading zone. Isostatic settling and erosion gradually reduces the elevations moving away from the zone.

;Impact Crater ridge: Large asteroid strikes typically form large impact craters bordered by rim(s) that are circular ridge(s).

;Shutter ridge: A shutter ridge is a ridge that has moved along a fault line, blocking or diverting drainage. Typically, a shutter ridge creates a valley corresponding to the alignment of the fault that produces it.

=== Volcanic and Hydrothermal ridges ===
;Pressure ridge (lava): A specific case of pressure ridge, also known as a &quot;tumulus&quot;, usually develops in lava flows, especially when slow-moving lava beneath a solidified crust wells upward. The brittle crust usually buckles to accommodate the inflating core of the flow, thus creating a central crack along the length of the tumulus.

;Volcanic crater/caldera ridges: Large volcanoes often have a central crater or caldera or both, bordered by rims that form circular ridges.

;Volcanic subglacial ridges: Subglacial volcanic eruptions can create volcanic ridges, known as &quot;tindars&quot;, that vary from tens of meters up to 250 meters in height. Tindars are a piles of volcanic ash that have been generated by explosive subaqueous eruptions in a glacial meltwater-filled vault or lake within a glacier or ice sheet.

<text>The Community Telegraph was a free distribution newspaper published by Independent News &amp; Media.
The newspaper, a sister paper of the paid-for title, &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot;, was created in order to replace its direct predecessor, the now defunct &quot;Herald and Post&quot;, also a freesheet.

The &quot;Community Telegraph&quot; was distributed weekly in four editions throughout north, south, east Belfast and County Down, Northern Ireland. Its paid-for competitors were the &quot;North Belfast News&quot; and &quot;South Belfast News&quot; from the Andersonstown News group, and the &quot;Bangor Spectator&quot; and &quot;Newtownards Chronicle&quot;. In April 2007 the paper was relaunched as The CT and in June that year a website was launched.

One journalist was assigned to each edition and was responsible for all aspects of editorial production - writing stories, taking photographs, designing pages and publishing on the internet. Leading UK media commentator Roy Greenslade has highlighted the model as one which other newspapers may adopt due to the potential for huge cost savings.

The &quot;Community Telegraph&quot; (and its four editions) was closed in December 2013, with INM describing the titles as &quot;no longer sustainable&quot; in light of falling print advertising revenues.

<text>The small forward (SF), also known as the three, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. Small forwards are typically shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers but taller, larger, and stronger than either of the guard positions. They are strategic and are often relied upon to score, defend, create open lanes, and rebound for their team.

The small forward is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions as they contribute offensively and defensively. In the NBA, small forwards typically range from 6&#x27; 6&quot; (1.98 m) to 6&#x27; 9&quot; (2.06 m); in the WNBA, they are usually between 6&#x27; 0&quot; (1.83 m) to 6&#x27; 2&quot; (1.88 m). This puts them at the average height of all professional basketball players because they are taller than the guards, but shorter than the power forward and center. 

Small forwards are responsible for scoring points and defending, and often are secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center. In professional basketball, some have considerable passing responsibilities, and many are prolific scorers. 

The styles with which small forwards score vary widely. Some are very accurate shooters, such as Kevin Durant, and some prefer to initiate physical contact with opposing players, such as LeBron James. Other small forwards are often primarily slashers who also possess jump shots. In some cases, small forwards position on the baseline; in other cases, they operate as off-ball specialists. The defensive specialists among them are notably versatile, often being able to guard multiple positions using their size, speed, and strength. Having adequate footwork and a solid defensive stance contributes to why small forwards are successful. When it comes to statistics, small forwards must be all over the map and at least have stats in most categories.

There are many excellent small forwards that are well known for their contributions and versatility. Top small forwards in the history of the WNBA include: Maya Moore, Angel McCoughtry, Tamika Catchings, Elena Delle Donne, and DeWanna Bonner. Small forwards inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame include Julius Erving, Larry Bird, James Worthy, Elgin Baylor, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, John Havlicek, Scottie Pippen, Alex English, Bernard King, Chris Mullin, Dominique Wilkins, Rick Barry, Grant Hill, Tamika Catchings, Cheryl Miller, and Sheryl Swoopes.

<text>The Greenland Dog (Greenlandic: &quot;Kalaallit Qimmiat&quot;, Danish: &quot;Grønlandshund&quot;) is a large breed of husky-type dog kept as a sled dog. They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Canadian Eskimo Dog. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is considered the same breed as the Greenland Dog since they have not yet diverged enough genetically to be considered separate breeds, despite their geographic isolation.

Today, the breed is considered nationally and culturally important to Greenland and efforts are made to safeguard its purity. In western Greenland north of the Arctic Circle and the entirety of eastern Greenland, it is illegal to import any dog from outside (except for police and assistance dogs with a special permit), and since 2017 all dogs have to be microchipped and registered in the Greenland dog database. In the southwest, such restrictions are not in place and the purity of dogs is not monitored. As the population has been falling ( 15,000 in Greenland as of 2016), a number of projects have been initiated in an attempt of ensuring that Greenland&#x27;s dog sledding culture, knowledge and use, along with the breed itself, are not lost.

== History ==
An Esquimaux bitch was exhibited at one of the earliest dog shows held in Darlington, Britain on 29 July 1875, which was reported in the &quot;Live Stock Journal&quot; and &quot;Fanciers Gazette&quot; published on 6 August 1875. They were recognized by the Kennel Club at its foundation in 1880.

The Greenland dog has been a draught animal in the Arctic regions for centuries and consequently they have developed a powerful body and heavy coats, with a natural capacity for load pulling and endurance in a harsh working environment. Roald Amundsen later used Greenland dogs to great success on his 1912 expedition to the Antarctic, where he became the first person to reach the South Pole. The men started with more dogs than they technically needed to pull the sledges, killing them along the way to use as food for dogs and men.

== Lineage ==


The first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. Dogs first appeared in Greenland around 4,000 years ago. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia. In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Huskies and Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor, and this haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs but the nearest match was with a 1,000 year-old dog from Florida.

Nearly all dog breed&#x27;s genetic closeness to the grey wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes – the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog that are also associated with Arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.

In 2020, a genetic study found that Greenland sled dogs have been kept isolated from other breeds since their arrival in Greenland with the Inuit 850 years ago. Their lineage traces more genomic history than other arctic-breeds to their ancestor&#x27;s remains which were found on Zhokhov Island, arctic northeastern Siberia and dated to be 9,500 years old. Based on this study, the Greenland Dog is considered one of the oldest dog breeds according to Guinness World Records.

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===
The Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular, short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back. When it lies down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool-like fur, the outer layer of longer, coarser, water-repellent fur. The Greenland Dog comes in all colors, from black to fawn (excluding albino dogs and merle patterning). Blue eyes and heterochromia are not permitted, and are considered disqualifications based on standard.

A characteristic of most Greenland Dogs is the &quot;úlo&quot;, a triangular shaped area on the shoulders. It is named after a common woman&#x27;s-knife from Greenland which is of the same shape.

Males are significantly larger than females at 60cm (23.6in) and up at the withers; females are 55cm (21.7in) and up.

=== Stamina ===
As is common among sled dogs, Greenland Dogs are able to traverse very difficult terrain with ease and with a high tempo. As working dogs they are especially valued for their physical strength and endurance, with a tireless and bold mentality.

<text>James Wylie Huffman (September 13, 1894May 20, 1980) was an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Ohio. He represented Ohio in the United States Senate from 1945 until 1946.

==Early life==
Huffman was born in Chandlersville, Ohio on September 13, 1894 and attended the schools of Rich Hill Township in Muskingum County as well as schools in Ashland County. He was a student at Ohio Wesleyan University and Ohio State University, then worked as a high school teacher and principal for three years.

==World War I==
Huffman joined the United States Army for World War I. He completed officer training, received his commission as a second lieutenant, and was assigned as a machine gun officer for the 329th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 83rd Division. He was subsequently assigned to the 120th Machine Gun Battalion, a unit of the 32nd Division. Huffman participated in four major American Expeditionary Forces offensives -- Aisne–Marne, Oise–Aisne, Meuse–Argonne, and Argonne Forest. In 1918, he was promoted to first lieutenant. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the war, Huffman remained in Germany for six months of occupation duty.

==Career==
Huffman was discharged from the army in 1919 and attended the University of Chicago Law School, from which he graduated with an LL.B. degree in 1922. He was admitted to the bar in Illinois and practiced in Chicago. He carried out a temporary appointment as an assistant state attorney general in 1923, then decided to return to Ohio.

In 1925, Huffman married Margaret Catherine Donahey, the daughter of Governor A. Victor Donahey. Huffman served as Donahey&#x27;s executive assistant during his governorship, and was a member of the state public utilities commission from 1927 to 1929. At the expiration of his term, Huffman began to practice law in Columbus. In 1944, Huffman ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Ohio governor. He subsequently served as Ohio&#x27;s director of commerce during the first term of Governor Frank Lausche.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1945, Senator Harold Hitz Burton resigned in order to accept appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Lausche appointed Huffman to fill the vacancy and he served in the U.S. Senate from October 8, 1945 to November 5, 1946, when Kingsley A. Taft defeated him in the election to complete the remainder of the term. After leaving the Senate, Huffman resumed practicing law until 1957, when he became president of the Motorists Mutual Insurance Company. He later became president of a newly-formed subsidiary, Motorists Life Insurance Company.

==Death and burial==

Huffman died in Pickerington, Ohio on May 20, 1980. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;ExternalData&quot;,&quot;service&quot;: &quot;page&quot;,&quot;title&quot;: &quot;Loreto-Perú y sus 8 Provincias.map&quot;}
&lt;/mapframe&gt;
Loreto () is Peru&#x27;s northernmost department and region. Covering almost one-third of Peru&#x27;s territory, Loreto is by far the nation&#x27;s largest department, slightly smaller than Japan; it is also one of the most sparsely populated regions due to its remote location in the Amazon Rainforest. Its capital is Iquitos.

==Geography==

* Northwest: Ecuador: Sucumbíos Province, Orellana Province, Pastaza Province and Morona-Santiago Province
* North: Colombia: Putumayo Department
* Northeast: Colombia: Amazonas Department
* East: Brazil: Amazonas State and Acre State
* South: Ucayali and Huánuco regions
* West: San Martín and Amazonas regions

Loreto&#x27;s large territory comprises parts of the high and low jungle, and is largely covered with thick vegetation.

This territory has wide river flood plains, which are covered with rainwater and are usually swamped in summer. In these flood areas there are elevated sectors called &quot;restingas&quot;, which always remain above water, even in times of the greatest swellings. There are numerous lagoons known as &quot;cochas&quot; and &quot;tipishcas&quot;, surrounded by marshy areas with abundant grass vegetation.

Numerous rivers cross Loreto&#x27;s territory, all of which are part of the Amazonian hydrographical system. Most of them are navigable. The main river crossing the region is the Amazon, one of the world&#x27;s most important rivers. Its numerous curves are always changing and sometimes make for a difficult journey. The width between banks of the Amazon sometimes measures a staggering . The Yavari River runs from Peru to Brazil, the Putumayo River serves as part of the border with Colombia, and the Ucayali and Marañón rivers penetrate Loreto after going through the Pongo de Manseriche.

===Climate===
The weather is warm and humid with an average temperature of to during the months of June and July, and up to a high of from December through March.

The average humidity level is 84%, with strong rain all year round.

==Administrative divisions==
The region is divided into eight provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 53 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
* Alto Amazonas (Yurimaguas)
* Datem del Marañón (San Lorenzo)
* Loreto (Nauta)
* Mariscal Ramón Castilla (Caballococha)
* Maynas (Iquitos)
* Requena (Requena)
* Ucayali (Contamana)
* Putumayo (San Antonio del Estrecho)

==History==
The first settlers in the region expanded through the various eastern slopes of the Andes. Many of these ethnic groups settled in the Purús, Turúa and Yaraví river basins, receiving names different from those of their lineage.

It is hard to determine the number of indigenous peoples in the region when the first European explorers and missionaries arrived. Numbers given by chroniclers indicate that within the first century of contact, 100,000 natives were baptized. Presumably, when the Spanish arrived, the total population was almost 300,000. Later on, however, the natives were afflicted with diseases such as smallpox, malaria, and yellow fever, due to contact with the Spaniards.

On February 12, 1542, and after a search of several months, Spanish conqueror Francisco de Orellana discovered the Amazon River, an adventure that began in the Sierra.

Even though colonization had started several decades earlier, the city of Iquitos was founded in the 1750s. It is located between the Nanay River and the left bank of the Amazon river, which makes it an ideal starting point when traveling to surrounding regions.

During colonial times, the Jesuits and Franciscans evangelized and founded different towns. During these years, they contributed by opening travel routes and cutting down distances between indigenous groups and colonial villages.

When the missions fell, a long period of relative national neglect followed, encompassing most of the 19th century. Nonetheless, this was the time when the foundations of the future political organization were laid. Also, this was the beginning of navigation via steamboats, the rubber heyday, and foreign immigration.

The Golden Age of Iquitos started at the end of the 19th century with the rubber boom. Since the region was very rich in rubber and it became so expensive, it turned into the center of attention and ambitions in the world. This period lasted 25 years and left behind gigantic development once the rubber boom had passed.

In 1853, the Littoral Province of Loreto was established, comprising today&#x27;s departments of Ucayali, San Martín, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia.

== Demographics ==
Loreto is home to many Amazonian indigenous peoples such as the Amhuacas and the Urarina. As of the 2017 Peru Census, 82% of the population identifies as Mestizo, 11.4% identify as other (mostly Amazonian tribes), 2.9% identify as Afro-Peruvian, 2% identify as White, and 1.5% identify as Quechua.

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the mother tongue of most of the residents was Spanish (92.51%). The following table shows the mother tongue of the people of the Loreto Region by province:
Ethnicities

==Culture==

===Festivities===
* First week of January. Anniversary of Iquitos. Week-long festivities to celebrate the founding of the city.
* Third week of February. Carnivals.
* June 24. &quot;Fiesta de San Juan&quot;. The local people go to the Nanay and Amazonas river banks, taking with them the traditional juanes, cooked on the eve. In front of the waters, they merrily drink and dance.
* First two weeks of August. A farm, livestock and crafts fair takes place in the small town of Santa Clara de Nanay, located from the city of Iquitos.
* September 7. &quot;Señora de la Natividad&quot;. Date in which the Tamshiyacu people, in the province of Maynas, honor their patron.
* December 8. &quot;Fiesta de la Purísima&quot;, celebrated in the district of Punchana, located from Iquitos

===Typical dishes and beverages===
The typical dishes in Loreto are very similar to those of other places in the Amazon region. &quot;Motelo&quot; or turtle meat soup and &quot;juanes&quot; (rice tamales with chicken or fish) are typical Loretan dishes. Vendors in the local markets offer fried or steamed monkey or lizard meat considered delicious according to the local people.

Other typical dishes include, &quot;cecina&quot; (dried and smoked pork), &quot;tacacho&quot; (coal cooked bananas, pork, and chopped onions), &quot;chonta&quot; salad, &quot;palometa&quot; (fish soup), carachama (fish) and &quot;paiche&quot; (a large fish). Among desserts there is a refreshing &quot;aguaje&quot; ice cream.

To drink, they serve &quot;masato&quot; (a beer made of cassava) or natural fruit juices such as aguaje, &quot;maracuyá&quot; (passion fruit), and &quot;cocona&quot; (&quot;Solanum sessiliflorum&quot;).

<doc id="714940" wikidata="Q76514" url="?curid=714940" title="Alfred Weber">
<text>Carl David Alfred Weber (; 30 July 1868 – 2 May 1958) was a German economist, geographer, sociologist, philosopher, and theoretician of culture whose work was influential in the development of modern economic geography. His other work focused on the sociology of knowledge and the role of intellectuals in society. In particular, he introduced the concept of free-floating intelligentsia (&quot;Freischwebende Intelligenz&quot;). 

==Life==
Alfred Weber, younger brother of the well-known sociologist Max Weber, was born in Erfurt and raised in Charlottenburg. From 1907 to 1933, he was a professor at Heidelberg University. Weber started his career as a lawyer and worked as a sociologist and cultural philosopher.

==Work==
Weber supported reintroducing theory and causal models to the field of economics, in addition to using historical analysis. In this field, his achievements involve work on early models of industrial location. He lived during the period when sociology became a separate field of science.

Though his theory on &#x27;Industrial Location&#x27; was strictly economic during his time it is widely studied in the field of geography now, mostly as a theoretical concept in the subdomain of economic geography.

Weber maintained a commitment to philosophy of history. He contributed theories for analyzing social change in Western civilization as a confluence of civilization (intellectual and technological), social processes (organizations) and culture (art, religion, and philosophy).

==Least cost theory==
Leaning heavily on work developed by the relatively unknown Wilhelm Launhardt, Alfred Weber formulated a least cost theory of industrial location which tries to explain and predict the locational pattern of industry at a macro scale. It emphasizes that firms seek a site with minimum costs for transport and labor.

== Material index ==
The point of optimal transportation is based on the costs of distance to the &quot;material index (MI)&quot; – the ratio of weights of the intermediate products (raw materials or RM) to finished product or FP.

a)  RM is more than FP;   MI&gt;1

b)  RM is equal to FP;       MI=1

c)  RM is less than FP;      MI&lt;1

In one scenario (a), the weight of the final product is less than the weight of the raw material going into making the product—the &quot;weight losing industry&quot;. For example, in the copper industry, it would be very expensive to haul raw materials to the market and process them there, so the processing occurs near the raw materials. (Besides mining, other primary activities (or extractive industries) are considered material oriented: timber mills, furniture manufacture, most agricultural activities, etc.. Often located in rural areas, these businesses may employ most of the local population. As they leave, the local area loses its economic base.)

In other cases, the final product is equally as heavy as the raw materials that require transport (i.e. the Material Index is equal to 1). Usually this is a case of some ubiquitous raw material, such as water, being incorporated into the product. This is called the weight-gaining industry. This type of industry might build up near a market or near a raw material source, and as a result might be called a foot-loose industry. Cotton industry is a prominent example of weight-gaining raw material.

In a third set of industries, including the heavy chemical industry, the weight of raw materials is less than the weight of the finished product. These industries always grow up near market.

Weber&#x27;s point of optimal transportation is a generalization of the Fermat point problem. In its simplest form, the Fermat problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the distances between D and each of the three other points is minimized. As for the Weber triangle problem, it consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimized. In 1971, Luc-Normand Tellier found the first direct (non iterative) numerical solution of the Fermat and Weber triangle problems. Long before Von Thünen&#x27;s contributions, which go back to 1818, the Fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of space economy. It was formulated by the famous French mathematician Pierre de Fermat before 1640. As for the Weber triangle problem, which is a generalization of the Fermat triangle problem, it was first formulated by Thomas Simpson in 1750, and popularized by Alfred Weber in 1909.

In 1985, in a book entitled &quot;Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l&#x27;espace habité&quot;, Tellier formulated an all-new problem called the &quot;attraction-repulsion problem&quot;, which constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003). The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005) as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.

<text>The Belfast Telegraph is a daily newspaper published in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by Independent News &amp; Media, which also publishes the Irish Independent, the Sunday Independent and various other newspapers and magazines in Ireland. Its editor is Eoin Brannigan. Reflecting its unionist tradition, the paper has historically been &quot;favoured by the Protestant population&quot;, while also being read within Catholic nationalist communities in Northern Ireland. It has been owned by Independent News and Media, a Dublin-based media company, since 2000, and is the company&#x27;s only print title outside of the Republic of Ireland.

==History==
It was first published as the Belfast Evening Telegraph on 1 September 1870 by brothers William and George Baird. Its first edition cost half a penny and ran to four pages covering the Franco-Prussian War and local news.

The evening edition of the newspaper was originally called the &quot;Sixth Late&quot;, and &quot;Sixth Late Tele&quot; was a familiar cry made by vendors in Belfast city centre in the past. Local editions were published for distribution to Enniskillen, Dundalk, Newry, and Derry.

Its competitors are &quot;The News Letter&quot; and &quot;The Irish News&quot;, and local editions of London-based red tops also compete in this market, in some cases selling at a cheaper price than the &quot;Tele&quot;.

Sometimes described as having &quot;unionist leanings&quot;, and operating an editorial policy supportive of &quot;moderate unionism&quot;, the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; was bought by the Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media group in March 2000.

The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; was entirely broadsheet until 19 February 2005, when the Saturday morning edition was introduced and all Saturday editions were converted to compact. The weekday morning compact edition was launched on 22 March 2005.

In 2015, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; launched the magazine supplement &quot;Family Life&quot;.

The paper now publishes two editions daily, &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; final edition and the &quot;North West Telegraph&quot; which is distributed in Derry.

Its editor, since April 2020, is Eoin Brannigan.

==Awards==
The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; was named as Best UK Regional Newspaper of the Year 2012 by the Society of Editors Regional Press Awards.

==Circulation==
Reflecting a decline in newspaper sales generally, circulation of the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; has declined as of the early 21st century, from 109,571 for the period July to December 2002, to 31,340 for the same period in 2019.

<doc id="714948" wikidata="Q210896" url="?curid=714948" title="Department of Madre de Dios">
<text>Madre de Dios (, ) is a department and region in southeastern Peru, bordering Brazil, Bolivia and the Peruvian departments of Puno, Cusco and Ucayali, in the Amazon Basin. Its capital is the city of Puerto Maldonado. It is also the third largest department in Peru, after Ucayali and Loreto. However, it is also the least densely populated department in Peru, as well as its least populous department. It has one of the lowest poverty rates in Peru.

The name of the department is derived from the Madre de Dios River, ultimately a tributary of the Amazon, and named by ethnic Spanish colonists. It is a very common Spanish language designation for the Virgin Mary, literally meaning Mother of God.

==Geography==
The department is almost entirely low-lying Amazon rainforest. The climate is warm and damp, with average temperatures around [max.: , min.: ]. The rainy season is from December to March, when torrential rainfall causes rivers to swell and often overflow their banks. Annual precipitation can be as much as .

The north-western boundary with the Cusco Region is known as the Isthmus of Fitzcarrald, a series of small and low mountains that separate the Madre de Dios River and the Urubamba/Ucayali River basins.

Notable rivers in the Madre de Dios River watershed are the Inambari, Tambopata, Manu, Tahuamanu, Las Piedras (also known as Tacuatimanu River), Heath, Acre and Los Amigos.

Due to the vast size of the area and its low population density, rivers provide the best way of getting from one town to another. Human activity is invariably confined to riverbanks. A number of explorers have searched for the lost city of &quot;Paititi&quot; in the jungle within the region. A new road that opened in early 2011 through the area will connect Brazil and Peru for trade, and change the isolation of this area.

The only important highway is between the Peruvian cities of Puerto Maldonado and Cusco, away in the Cuzco Department. It is part of the newly built Interoceanic Road between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, passing by the border town Iñapari on the Acre river. Flights between Cusco and Puerto Maldonado remain the most common and quicker method of transport between the two.

From Puerto Maldonado a road about long leads to the mining town Laberinto (&quot;Labyrinth&quot;). A second road is between the village of Pillcopata and Itahuania (into the Manú National Park). It is a roughly -long single-track road that is hard to travel in the rainy season. It also has a dirt road to the native community of Infierno (&quot;Hell&quot;), where the Ese&#x27;ejas (or Guarayos) live. Their chief is Agustín Shapaja, who led the famous expedition (made into a TV special) to the Candamo. He was featured in the TV documentary &quot;El Candamo, la Ultima Tierra sin Hombres&quot; (The Candamo, The Last Land without Men).

==Economy==
Madre de Dios depends heavily on natural products and raw materials for its economy. There is virtually no manufacturing industry. The main agricultural products are:

#Cotton
#Coffee
#Sugarcane
#Cacao beans
#Brazil nuts
#Palm oil

Gold mining is the only other large industry of the region, confined mainly to alluvium adjacent to the Inambari and Madre de Dios rivers. Significant deforestation has resulted due to this activity. In addition, techniques for gold mining have been described as resulting in both a major environmental and public health problem. Most gold miners use liquid mercury to extract gold particles from the alluvium. They often handle the toxic liquid mercury with their bare hands. To purify the gold particles, the mercury is burned off. After being vaporized, mercury particles contaminate the surrounding ecosystems. Mercury bioaccumulates throughout the food chain to become concentrated in top predators, such as large river fish and carnivorous birds. The local people may be harmed by direct contact with the element, as well as by ingesting dangerous levels of mercury when they eat the fish. Mercury results in a variety of neurological and congenital health problems.

Ecotourism is a major emerging industry in Madre de Dios. A number of lodges in Manu and Tambopata are becoming part of what is described as the Vilcabamba-Amboró Corridor. Some of these EcoLodges offer adventure activities as well, such as Ecoaventuras Amazonicas. New legislation encourages private investors to create concessions for conservation or ecotourism. This is to extend the reaches of the public protected areas. This integration includes native communities, which are increasingly involved in ecotourism. The importance of including the local population relies on the long-term incentives for leaving standing forest. The local population is integrated into conservation initiatives as well as economic cycles.

==Political divisions==
The region is divided into three provinces (provincias, singular: provincia), which are composed of 11 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
* Manu (Salvación)
* Tahuamanu (Iñapari)
* Tambopata (Puerto Maldonado)

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the national 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents of the region was Spanish (80.00%), followed by Quechua (16.53%). The Quechua varieties spoken in Madre de Dios are Cusco–Collao Quechua and Santarrosino Kichwa. The following table shows the breakdown by province of first languages:

==Culture==
The region is the location of many ancient Inca ruins. Several indigenous tribes survive in the jungle of the Amazon Basin. 

== Places of interest ==
* Amarakaeri Communal Reserve
* Purús Communal Reserve
* Tambopata National Reserve

==Representation in other media==
*This area was the setting of Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; (1982), based on the exploits of Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald (1862–1897), a rubber baron from Iquitos.
*In the science fiction novel &quot;&quot; (2008), most of the story takes place in Madre de Dios. A time anomaly has opened and let a pack of prehistoric &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot; into the modern world.
*The region is the subject of a memoir by conservationist and explorer &quot;Paul Rosolie&quot;, &quot;Mother of God: An Extraordinary Journey into the Uncharted Tributaries of the Western Amazon&quot; (2014)
*The region is the primary setting for the memoir &quot;Ruthless River: Love and Survival by Raft on the Amazon&#x27;s Relentless Madre de Dios&quot; (2017) by Holly Fitzgerald about an ill-fated rafting journey in 1973.

<text>Minar-e-Pakistan (, &quot;Manār-e-Pākastān&quot;; ; ) is a public monument tower located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 – the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.

The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called the Greater Iqbal Park.

==Design==

The tower reflects a blend of Mughal/Islamic and modern architecture.

The tower was designed and supervised by, Nasreddin Murat-Khan, a Russian-born Pakistani architect and civil engineer. The minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can access the top by climbing up the stairs or by means of an elevator.

The tower base is shaped like a flower. The area surrounding the monument is covered with parks and flowers. The location is often used for political and religious events. It is also known as the &quot;Liberty Tower of Pakistan&quot;.

=== Structure ===

The base is about 8 metres above the ground. The tower rises about 62 metres on the base, and the total height of the Minar is about 70 metres above the ground. The unfolding petals of the flower-like base are 9 metres high. The diameter of the tower is about 9.75 meters. The rostrum is built of patterned tiles, and faces Badshahi Mosque. The base consists of four platforms. To symbolise the humble beginning of the struggle for freedom, the first platform is built with uncut stones from Taxila, the second platform is made of hammer-dressed stones, and the third platform is made of chiselled stones. Polished white marble used for the fourth and final platform depicts the success of the Pakistan Movement. The structure uses the imagery of crescents and stars, signs that symbolize the culture of Pakistan, similarly seen in the National Flag.

Mr. Mukhtar Masood, a prolific writer and the then–deputy commissioner of Lahore, was one of the members of the Building Committee for the tower. Services Engineer Mian Abdul Ghani Mughal went on to build many other landmarks of Pakistan, including Gaddafi Stadium Lahore, City Hospital Gujranwala, Chand da Qila By-Pass Gujranwala, Lords Hotel, and University of Punjab Campus Gujranwala.

=== Inscriptions ===
At the base, there are floral inscriptions on ten converging white marble commemorative plaques. The inscriptions include the text of the Lahore Resolution in Urdu, Bengali and English, as well as the Delhi Resolution&#x27;s text, which was passed on 9 April 1946. On different plaques, Quranic verses and 99 names of Allah are inscribed in Arabic calligraphy. Other important inscriptions included on the monument are the National Anthem of Pakistan in Urdu and Bengali, excerpts from the speeches of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Urdu, Bengali and English; and a few couplets written by Allama Iqbal.

==Construction==
The foundation stone was laid on 23 March 1960. Construction took eight years, and was completed on 21 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs 7,058,000. The money was collected by imposing an additional tax on cinema and horse racing tickets at the demand of Akhter Husain, governor of West Pakistan.

==Significance==
Minar-e-Pakistan is considered the national emblem of Pakistan, and an expression of post-colonial national identity.

== Notable visits and events==
On February 21, 1999, Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the first Indian leader to visit Minar-e-Pakistan (previous Indian state visits to Pakistan had not included a visit to Lahore). Vajpayee&#x27;s visit was compared to Nixon&#x27;s visit to China in terms of significance.

Minar-e-Pakistan has served as the location for a number of rallies. The rallies have often caused damage to the surrounding flora, according to the Parks and Horticulture Authority. In 2014, the Punjab government considered banning any political or non-political large gatherings.

<doc id="714958" wikidata="Q208182" url="?curid=714958" title="Department of Moquegua">
<text>Moquegua () is a department and region in southern Peru that extends from the coast to the highlands. Its capital is the city of Moquegua, which is among the main Peruvian cities for its high rates of GDP and national education.

== Geography ==
The department&#x27;s volcanoes and its geomorphology make its geography remarkable. It is formed by upstream portion of the Tambo River, one of the most torrential coastal rivers, which forms deep valleys that can be divided into three sectors, the first one being in the northwest, forming the Puquina-La Capilla sector. These are veritable oasis enclaved in the rocks; arid hillsides and some terraces where horticulture is possible. High quality alfalfa as well as fruits, especially grapes, are produced here, due to a good climate and a rich soil. The second sector is the valley of Omate, one of the most populated and fertile soils of the department. The Ubinas Volcano, Peru&#x27;s most active volcano, is located nearby. In the hillsides, the land is fertile in contrast with the desolation and sterility of its highlands. In the southern part of the Tambo River is located the town of Carumas, which along with Puquina and Omate, are the vital centers of this geography. The Moquegua River is a short run one and is formed by its tributaries: the Torata, Huaracane and Tumilaca rivers. After passing through the regional capital, it digs deep into a canyon called the Osmare.

=== Boundaries ===
The Department of Moquegua is bordered by the Arequipa Region in the north, the Puno Region in the east, the Tacna Region in the south and the Pacific Ocean in the west.

== Political division ==

The region is divided into three provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 20 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
* General Sánchez Cerro (Omate)
* Ilo (Ilo)
* Mariscal Nieto (Moquegua)

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
According to the 1993 census, the Moquegua Region has a population of 128,747 inhabitants, 51.9% of which (66,843) are male and 48.1% (61,904) are female.

, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática estimates the region&#x27;s population to be 156,750.

=== Languages ===
According to the last census in Peru in 2007, the languages learnt first by the residents were Spanish (79.37%), Aymara (10.71%), Quechua (9.57%) and Asháninka (0.04%). Other indigenous languages were learnt first by 0.19% and foreign languages by 0.04%. The Quechua variety spoken in Moquegua is Cusco–Collao Quechua. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Moquegua Region by province:

=== Immigration ===
Persons originating from other regions of the country make up 37.8% of the population and 0.2% of residents were born abroad.

The largest immigrant groups come from the Puno Region (14.7% of the total population) and the Arequipa Region (9.9%).

=== Age ===
The population is spread out, with 43.3% under the age of 20, 9.9% from 20 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 13.4% from 45 to 64, and 4.8% who are 65 years of age or older.

=== Education ===
Secondary education has been attended by 33.3% of the population and 5.5% also have graduated from non-university higher education, while 4.3% have complete university studies. 37.9% only have attended primary education and 7.1% have not had any education.

The illiteracy rate in the region is 10%.

== History ==
Inca oral tradition as documented by the Spanish chroniclers has long held that the present-day Moquegua Region was inhabited by small groups of natives known as &quot;pukinas&quot; and &quot;qullas&quot; long before the arrival of the Incas. According to chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega, it was Inca Mayta Cápac who organized the military expedition to expand the domains of the Cusco monarchs along this part of the coast.
Since these were fertile lands, capable of supporting a larger population, the Inca army officers in charge decided to establish the towns of Cuchuna and Moquegua. In doing so, they were also protecting the Inca domain over the conquered lands.

Archaeological research conducted over the past several decades has shed considerable light on the ancient history of Moquegua, giving this remote section of Peru a unique place in the history of Peru. Archaeological surveys and excavations, documented in myriad professional publications, as well as books for the public available at Moquegua&#x27;s Museo Contisuyo, demonstrate a sequence of occupation stretching from more than 10,000 B.C. through the present day.

There is no accurate data on the Spanish conquest or the founding of the city of Moquegua by its army. Presumably, it was founded on 25 November 1541 by Pedro Cansino and his wife, Josefa de Bilbao.

During the War of the Pacific, Moquegua suffered the invasion of Chilean troops. They looted all buildings —including churches— tortured women, and took people&#x27;s jewelry.

==Tourism==

===In the city===

The attractions in the city of Moquegua are Main Square which features a fountain made and built in France by the Engineer Gustave Eifel, Santo Domingo Church contains the image of Santa Fortuna, a martyr, from the first centuries of Christianity who is worshipped by the faithful.

Contisuyo Museum is also located in the city of Moquegua. The museum exhibits a variety of archaeological remains of the Uros and Puquina cultures as well as an explanation of the time period in which different cultures settle in this region.

Other attractions in the city are casa del regidor perpetuo de la ciudad and casa de Alayza, which are houses built with architecture of the eighteenth century.

===Outside the city===
Attractions outside the city are Samegua which has the best typical food restaurants for tourists. Samegua also produces good quality avocados which are the reason why it&#x27;s called the avocado territory. Another attraction located from Moquegua is Torata that is a district that offers the visitor a picturesque environment in which the visitor can admire the traditional ridged roof houses, the Torata Church, the stone windmills from the viceroyal period, and Sabaya and Camata an Inca administrative center known as the Machu Picchu of Moquegua. In addition at about northeast of Moquegua is found Mount Baul a geological formation which appear to have been cut perpendicular in the top area and it also bears a resemblance to the type of chest of trunk that was utilized all over Peru in the old days.

Another attraction outside of the city is Ilo located from Moquegua. Ilo is one of the most tourist visited places in Moquegua. The main places to visit in this town are: Punta Coles, Los Olivares, and El Puerto, La Glorieta Jose Galvez, San Geronino church and beautiful beaches like Roca del Rio.

<text>Lilith Clay, also known as Omen, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Robert Kanigher and Nick Cardy, Lilith made her first appearance in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #25 (February 1970) and commonly appears as a member of the eponymous group. She is depicted as the best friend of Donna Troy (the first Wonder Girl) and the second hero to join the original Teen Titans after its founders, following Roy Harper (the first Speedy). Although her origin and powers have varied significantly throughout her history, she is consistently seen as both precognitive and psychic.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Lilith is a girl with psychic powers who leaves home after learning that she is adopted. She joins the Teen Titans, but eventually leaves them and moves to the West Coast. There, she founds Titans West and enters a relationship with Gnarrk.

Prior to the disbanding of the original Teen Titans and their Titans West counterpart group, Lilith revealed that she had a vision of her teammate Donna Troy (Wonder Girl) marrying a red-haired man before they and their child are killed. Fearing Lilith&#x27;s prophecy, Donna breaks up with Roy Harper.

During the &quot;Terror of Trigon&quot; storyline (&quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #1–6), Lilith bonds with the goddess Azar and houses the souls of her followers to cleanse Raven of evil.

After Azrael returns, Lilith gains pyrokinesis, learns that she is the daughter of the Titan Thia, and leaves to live on Mount Olympus.

===Post-Crisis===
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Lilith does not appear for some time. She later appears as the masked figure Omen and helps gather the Teen Titans.

In &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot;, Lilith is killed by a malfunctioning Superman android. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, she returns as a Black Lantern before Dawn Granger kills her.

=== The New 52 ===
An unrelated, villainous character named Omen appears in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot as an ally of Harvest and N.O.W.H.E.R.E.

===DC Rebirth===
The original Lilith appears in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, where she is revealed to be a founding member of the Teen Titans and former lover of Wally West.

In &quot;Dawn of DC&quot;, Lilith and Power Girl establish a psychic counseling service where Power Girl enters the minds of others and physically defeats their problems.

==Powers and abilities==
Lilith Clay possesses various psychic abilities, including telepathy, precognition, and energy projection. Furthermore, she can teleport and generate illusions and fire.

<doc id="714977" wikidata="Q1771130" url="?curid=714977" title="Jarlsberg">
<text>Jarlsberg was a former countship that forms a part of today&#x27;s Vestfold county in Norway. 

The former countships of Jarlsberg and Larvik were merged into a county in 1821. Jarlsberg and Larvik&#x27;s County (&quot;Jarlsberg og Larviks amt&quot;) were renamed Vestfold in 1919.

Created in 1673 as Griffenfeldt Countship (&quot;Griffenfeld grevskap&quot;), it was after a few years known as Tønsberg Countship (&quot;Tønsberg grevskap&quot;) until 1684, when the name became Jarlsberg. Dating to 1681, the countship was associated with members of the Dano-Norwegian noble family, Wedel-Jarlsberg. The countship was abolished in 1893 in accordance with Norway&#x27;s nobility law, but the manor is still in its own family.

== House of Griffenfeld==
Jarlsberg was originally created as a countship in 1673 for Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld, a Danish statesman and Chancellor of Denmark during the reign of King Christian V of Denmark. Schumacher received in 1671 an armorial grant with the name Griffenfeld. The creation involved that Count Griffenfeld, in addition to owning 14 percent of the countship&#x27;s land, received large tax revenues and also the right to appoint all civil and ecclesiastical officials, including officers and judges, who would serve within the countship. 

* 1673-1676 Count Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld
== House of Gyldenløve==
After Griffenfeld&#x27;s arrest in 1676, in the aftermath of the Scanian War, his properties and the countship was renamed Tønsberg Countship and were transferred by King Christian V to Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve, the Count of Larvik. Gyldenløve, an illegitimate son of King Frederick III of Denmark, was the Viceroy (&quot;Statholder&quot;) of Norway. 

* 1676-1684 Count Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve

== House of Wedel Jarlsberg==
In 1683, Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve sold Tøsnberg countship to Gustav Frederik Wilhelm Wedel. Von Wedel was an ancient nobility from Holstein, which received naturalization patent in 1681 as Friherre von Wedel by king Christian V. Field Marshal Wedel, who had become commanding General in Norway in 1681, received the title Lensgreve patent with the name &quot;Wedel af Jarlsberg&quot; in 1684 and introduced the name Jarlsberg, which means ‘Earl’s Hill’.

* 1684-1718 Count Gustav Wilhelm von Wedel-Jarlsberg 
* 1718–1738 Count Frederik Anton Wedel Jarlsberg
* 1738–1776 Count Frederik Christian Otto Wedel Jarlsberg
* 1776–1811 Count Frederik Anton II Wedel Jarlsberg
* 1811–1840 Count Johan Caspar Herman Wedel Jarlsberg
* 1840–1893 Peder Anker Wedel Jarlsberg

<text>Piura () is a coastal department and region in northwestern Peru. The region&#x27;s capital is Piura and its largest port cities, Paita and Talara, are also among the most important in Peru. The area is known for its tropical and dry beaches. It is the most populous department in Peru, its twelfth smallest department, and its fourth-most densely populated department, after Tumbes, La Libertad, and Lambayeque.

The country&#x27;s latest decentralization program is in hiatus after the proposal to merge departments was defeated in the national referendum in October 2005. The referendum held on October 30, 2005, as part of the ongoing decentralization process in Peru, to decide whether the region would merge with the current regions of Lambayeque and Tumbes to create a new &quot;Región Norte&quot; was defeated.

==Geography==
The Piura Region is bordered to the north by the Tumbes Region and Ecuador, to the east by Cajamarca Region, to the south by the Lambayeque Region, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Punta Pariñas&quot; in Piura is South America&#x27;s most western point.

The territory of the Piura Region has many climate variations due to its geographical location. It is just 4 degrees south of the equator, yet receives two ocean currents at the same time: the cold Humboldt Current () and the warm El Niño Current (). This makes the Piura Region a land that is both tropical and arid at the same time, &quot;The Land where the Tropics meets The Desert&quot;

The coast is divided by the Peruvian &quot;subtropical desert&quot; of Sechura on the south and savanna-like scrub Tumbes–Piura dry forests to the center and north of the region. There are also small valleys of tropical climate, where rice and coconut fields are common, especially around the Piura and Sullana rivers.

There is montane forest (&quot;selva alta&quot;) as one goes away from the coast onto the sierra. Páramo climates and cooler temperatures appear higher in the sierra.

Topography is smooth in the coast and rough in the Sierra. There are many arid plains in the southern region. The Sechura Desert, located south of the Piura River, is Peru&#x27;s largest desert and one of the world&#x27;s few examples of a tropical desert; it borders a tropical terrain to the north. The Bayóvar Depression, which is the lowest point in Peru and all of the Southern Tropics, is located in this desert.

The morphological forms most common in the coast are the dry ravine that suddenly become copious when there are heavy rains, forming tropical dry forests all over. Other features are half-moon shaped dunes, the marine terraces such as those of Máncora, Talara and Lobitos. Valleys have been formed by fluvial terraces of the Chira River and Piura River.

To the east, valleys are more or less deep and have been eroded by rivers forming &quot;equatorial tropical-dry-forests&quot;. The major peak surpasses 3000 m. The Paso de Porculla, in the southwest of the territory is only 2,138 meters high and is the lowest pass of the Peruvian Andes.

The rivers crossing its territory belong both to the Pacific watershed and to the Amazon Basin. The Chira River is the most important and flows into the Pacific Ocean. The Piura River also flows into the Pacific Ocean although the flow varies greatly with the changing seasons and during severe droughts will dry up.

===Climate===

The climate is subtropical and tropical savanna in the center and north coast, Semi-arid in the southern coast near Lambayeque Region. Piura has a tropical dry or tropical savanna climate monsoon weather that averages throughout the whole year. Pleasant warm winters (June to October) that average between during the daytime and lows around during the night.

In 2013 and 2016, Chulucanas and the Lancones District, two places in the Department of Piura, recorded a temperature of . This is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Peru.

Piura is covered by deserts, tropical valleys, dry equatorial forests, tropical montane climates as you reach between 1000 and 1500 meters, and a humid subtropical sierra climate if you reach over 2,000 meters. The Páramo climate is found in the higher regions of the Sierra.

Rain is scarce from May to November: it rains only from December to April at discontinuous rates due to the influence of the El Niño Current, but every so often, when the El Niño phenomenon arrives, rain is copious and makes the dry ravines become alive, giving rise not only to the impressive forests but to many floods and great landslides. El Niño occurs when ocean waters reach . When ocean water temperatures elevate 1 or 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than , the consequence could be catastrophic rains.

Although ocean waters can drop to during the dry winter months (May to October), they can also rise to during the humid summer months (December to April); this calls for pleasant rains; yet if the temperatures rise 1 or 1.5 °C degrees above that, El Niño is assured.

During the hottest days of summer (December to April), temperatures can reach almost inland. During night time, 30s or even high 20s may seem unpleasant, which urge people to go to beach resorts such as Máncora or Colán.

The rest of the months have pleasant summer temperatures in the low 30s and mid 20s °C (77–90 °F).

===Natural resources and wildlife===

Piura is a land of unique algarrobo trees, a variety of mesquite similar to the carob, and it is the region with the most equatorial tropical dry forests in the whole Pacific.

These ecoregions carry a unique variety of orchids, birds, reptiles, plants and mammals. Piura is known for the best and oldest lime-lemons in South America as well as South America&#x27;s finest mango (tropical dry). With Lambayeque, it is the original home of Pima cotton. Piura also produces bananas, coconuts, rice and other fruits as local income.

The &quot;Manglares de San Pedro de Vice&quot; in Sechura Province of Piura are the southernmost mangroves on the Pacific coast of South America.

Its development has been favoured also by the petroleum found in the ocean of Talara Province, fishing is blessed by two ocean currents, silver mines are common and the current Bayovar Deposits are present as well.

==History==

The most important culture that developed in the Piura region was Vicús, which stood out for its ceramics and delicate work in gold. The Tallanes or Yungas, however, were the first settlers, who migrated from the Sierra. During a period that is still vague, they lived in &quot;behetrias&quot;, which were primitive settlements without a head or an organization. Later they were conquered by the Mochicas and, centuries later, by the Incas, during the rule of Tupac Inca Yupanqui.

In 1532, Francisco Pizarro founded the first Spanish city in South America on the banks of the Chira River in the Tangarará Valley. He named it San Miguel de Piura. The founding date is still subject of controversy. However, during the 450th anniversary celebrations, July 15 was adopted as the official date.

In 1534, due to a lack of sanitary conditions, the capital was moved to Monte de los Padres (Morropón); in 1578, and for the same reason, it was moved again, this time to San Francisco de la Buena Esperanza (Paita). In 1588, the permanent attacks of the English pirates and privateers forced a final relocation of the capital to Piura.

During colonial times, life went by peacefully. Yet, the raids against the Spanish authorities led by Admirals Borran and Cochrane, members of the libertarian expedition of José de San Martín, woke the longing for liberty in the minds of the local people.

==Culture and customs of Piura==

Piura is host to a stunning &quot;mestizo&quot; culture, since all races mix here.
Local &quot;Piuranos&quot; have a different accent from their neighbours at both sides since: they tend elongate their syllables in a similar ways to northern Mexicans. &quot;Piuranos&quot; have their own proud slang. Locals for example, call themselves &quot;Churres&quot; (popular term used for a young Piuran or northern person).

&quot;Piuranos&quot; are characterized by their witty minds, melancolic &quot;Tondero music&quot; and welcoming personalities. Like many Peruvians, they enjoy drinking chicha de jora, pisco or beer and many of them have a tendency towards creativity and art as their source of income.

Local gastronomical dishes include the Piuran Secho de Chavelo (the capital&#x27;s dish), Algarrobina cocktails, many types of ceviches and other seafoods like Majarisco and Pasao al Agua. Piura is famed for its natilla sweets as well.

The warm climate of this region forbids hard labour from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., so it is common tradition to take &quot;siestas&quot; and better to wake up early to get important stuff done before noon.

Processions and religious folk are passionately practiced by some of the locals. One of them is Cristo de Ayabaca.

Popular crafts are the Chulucana Pottery and handy hats and silversmith arts made from the Catacaos Province.

Northern cowboys can still be seen today wandering the deserts of Sechura, Catacaos and the forests of Morropon transporting their goods using donkeys and mules. They seem to resemble physically the &quot;American Southwest&quot; cowboys, or Argentinian gauchos and Mexican charros. They are noted not only for their abilities to sing and play &quot;Cumanana and Tondero&quot; but as silversmiths that work the filigree earrings, leathers, hats, wooden and silver utensils of Catacaos region.

===Music===

The Tondero and Cumanana are the traditional music of the Piura Region.

Chicha music, now called Tecnocumbia (originally a Peruvian styled cumbia with electronic elements), is the modern version of popular music all over, as well as &quot;Salsa&quot; among youngsters.

Another great tradition that is sung by all northern Peruvians is the famous &quot;Peruvian Waltz&quot;, well practiced by traditional musicians (northern Peruvians have their style).

==Political division==

The region is divided into 8 provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 64 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

<doc id="714988" wikidata="Q304550" url="?curid=714988" title="Simeon D. Fess">
<text>Simeon Davison Fess (December 11, 1861 – December 23, 1936) was a Republican politician and educator from Ohio, United States. He served in the United States House of Representatives (1915 to 1923) and U.S. Senate (1923 to 1935).

==Early life==
Born on a farm near Harrod, Ohio, to Henry and Barbara (Herring) Fess, he was educated in country schools and graduated at Ohio Northern University (ONU) of Ada in 1889 and married Eva C. Thomas the following year. After graduation, he taught history and law at the university as well was working in the university administration from 1889 to 1896. Fess graduated from the law department at ONU in 1894 and served as dean of that department from 1896 to 1900. He then served as vice president of the university from 1900 to 1902. He left for Illinois to become a graduate student and lecturer at the University of Chicago from 1902 to 1907. He then returned to Ohio and served as the president of Antioch College of Yellow Springs from 1907 to 1917.

==Politics==
In 1912, while still serving at Antioch College, Fess was a delegate to the state constitutional convention as well as being elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1913 – March 3, 1923 (6th district 1913–15, 7th district 1915–23). He served as chairman of the Committee on Education during the Sixty-sixth and Sixty-seventh Congresses, and chairman of the Republican National Congressional Committee from 1918 to 1922. In 1922, he did not seek re-election, but ran for the U.S. Senate and won, serving from March 4, 1923, to January 3, 1935. He served as chairman of the Committee on the Library during Sixty-ninth through Seventy-second Congresses, and as Republican Whip from 1929 to 1933. He also served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1930 to 1932. After his appointment, the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; referred to Fess as a &quot;party wheelhouse and stand patter of the most approved type,&quot; and added &quot;It was Senator Fess&#x27;s proven ability not only to defend, but to eulogize, the acts of Republican administrations, no matter how unpopular they may be, that led to his selection as national chairman.&quot; Fess campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover by claiming Hoover was &quot;the country&#x27;s greatest peacetime leader,&quot; a hard sell in the fall of 1932. That speech, a month before the presidential election, was delivered to just 150 listeners, a sign of the Republican Party&#x27;s problems in mid-Depression. He was an unsuccessful candidate for a third term as senator in 1934.

==Retirement and death==
Fess was a Methodist, an editor, an author and a member of the Freemasons and Knights of Pythias. He died in Washington, D.C. at the age of 75 and was interred at Glen Forest Cemetery in Yellow Springs, Ohio.

<text>A bike path or a cycle path is a bikeway separated from motorized traffic and dedicated to cycling or shared with pedestrians or other non-motorized users. In the US a bike path sometimes encompasses &quot;shared use paths&quot;, &quot;multi-use path&quot;, or &quot;Class III bikeway&quot; is a paved path that has been designated for use by cyclists outside the right of way of a public road. It may or may not have a center divider or stripe to prevent head-on collisions. In the UK, a &quot;shared-use footway&quot; or &quot;multi-use path&quot; is for use by both cyclists and pedestrians.

== Bike paths with independent rights-of-way==
Bike paths that follow independent rights-of-way are often used to promote recreational cycling. In Northern European countries, cycling tourism represents a significant proportion of overall tourist activity. Extensive interurban bike path networks can be found in countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands, which has had a national system of cycle routes since 1993. These networks may use routes dedicated exclusively to cycle traffic or minor rural roads whose use is otherwise restricted to local motor traffic and agricultural machinery.

The &quot;Fietspad&quot; or Bicycle Path in the Netherlands is logically constructed to link shops, housing, stations, schools, workplaces for everyday cycling. The more sensible approach is based on efforts to increase utility cycling. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. by 2007 9% of all shopping trips in Germany were by bicycle.

Although it is unusual, to connect people to places, bike paths may be extended into indoor spaces. An example is the indoor bike path at Funan Mall in Singapore that is extended from a shared-use biking and walking path along North Bridge Road.

The UK has recently implemented the National Cycle Network.

Where available, these routes are often rail trails making use of abandoned railway corridors. A prominent example in the UK is the Bristol &amp; Bath Railway Path, a path for walkers and cyclists that is part of National Cycle Route 4. Other UK examples include The Ebury Way Cycle Path, The Alban Way, the Hillend Loch Railway Path and the Nicky Line. In 2003 the longest continuous bike path in Europe was opened, along the Albacete-Valdeganga highway in Spain, a distance of . Bogota&#x27;s Bike Paths Network (&quot;Ciclorutas de Bogotá&quot; in Spanish), designed and built during the administration of Mayor Enrique Peñalosa attracts significant recreational use. Numerous cycle links between regions are being developed in Italy. The most important is the &quot;Ciclovia Adriatica&quot;, partially completed which extends, at times, from Trieste to Santa Maria di Leuca. 

The relative safety of bike paths that follow independent rights-of-way closed to motorized traffic is difficult to assess. In terms of car/bicycle collisions, this is clearly mediated by how the bike path network rejoins the main road network. In the English town of Milton Keynes, a study showed that cyclists using the off-road Milton Keynes redway system had on a per journey basis a significantly higher rate of fatal car-bicycle collisions at path/roadway crossings than cyclists on ordinary roads. This safety can be altered substantially by design. For example, the Dutch Simultaneous Green Junction design has a nearly flawless record when it comes to accommodating cyclists at traffic light junctions.

== Shared use path ==
In many jurisdictions bike paths are shared with pedestrians, but there is a wide variety of quality in helping to minimize cyclist-pedestrian conflicts.

== Pop-up bike paths ==

Pop-up bike paths are created rapidly in response to unforeseen events, usually with short timescales between their inception and implementation. The creation of pop-up bike paths typically involves &quot;reallocating road space to better enable this shift and make it safer for people who choose to walk, cycle or wheel for essential trips or for exercise&quot;.

<text>San Martín () is a department and region in northern Peru. Most of the department is located in the upper part of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Its capital is Moyobamba and the largest city in the department is Tarapoto.

==Geography==

===Boundaries===
* North and East: Loreto Region
* South: Huánuco Region
* West: La Libertad and Amazonas regions

===Morphology===

The territory of San Martín can be divided into four morphological zones: 
* the west, near the eastern side of the Andean Plateau, with a rough topography and many ravines;
* the zone of the wide valleys, with stepped terraces formed by the Huallaga River and its affluents, where population is engaged mainly in cattle and agriculture;
* the southwest zone, with a relief coming down from the Cordillera Azul, with low elevation, where is an impressive canyon known as Cajón de Sión, which finishes in the Cayumba rapids;
* a small lower-lying jungle zone with areas easily flooded and with almost no hills.

The Huallaga River is one of the most important rivers in the region. It forms, together with its tributaries a hydrographical system which drains all of the region&#x27;s territory. The Pongo de Aguirre is an important canyon formed by the Huallaga going through the Andean hills.

==History==

Tupac Yupanqui entered and subdued the Inca dominion, the province of Moyobamba, known back then by its native name, Muyupampa. In 1539, Spaniard Alonso de Alvarado reached the Mayo River and founded a city he named &quot;Santiago de los Valles de Moyobamba&quot;, which later became the capital of Maynas. Another important personality was Priest Manuel Sobreviela who, between 1787 and 1790, accomplished traveling across the Huallaga River and subsequently published a map named &quot;Planning for the course of the Huallaga and Ucayali Rivers and for the Pampa del Sacramento&quot;.

On August 19, 1821, Moyobamba was the first Peruvian city in declaring its independence.

The construction of a highway in recent years has increased the exchange of different products, benefitting the economy of this region.

==Political division==

The region is divided into 10 provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 78 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;).

The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
* Bellavista (Bellavista)
* El Dorado (San José de Sisa)
* Huallaga (Saposoa)
* Lamas (Lamas)
* Mariscal Cáceres (Juanjuí)
* Moyobamba (Moyobamba)
* Picota (Picota)
* Rioja (Rioja)
* San Martín (Tarapoto)
* Tocache (Tocache)

==Archaeology==

Gran Pajáten is a pre Inca complex of circular slate buildings decorated with figures of flying condors situated on the border with La Libertad. Due to its difficult access, tourism is not yet possible at the site.

<text>Elnesvågen is the administrative centre of Hustadvika Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The village is located along the Frænafjorden about north of the town of Molde, east of the village of Tornes, and northwest of the villages of Malme and Sylte. The village has a population (2018) of 2,572 and a population density of .

The area is predominantly an agricultural area; however, there are also several factories including Moxy Engineering (which produces trucks), the Hustadmarmor marble factory (which produces calcium products for European paper producers), and the Tine cheese factory (which is the largest producer of Jarlsberg cheese with exports to the UK, USA, Canada, Germany, and Australia).

Myrbostad Church was built in 1880 in the eastern part of Elnesvågen. A combined association football-athletics stadium was completed in 1997. The best views of Elnesvågen are from the mountains Heiane/Lågheiane and Gjendemsfjellet. Heiane is most easily accessible from Hauglia, the major residential area in Elnesvågen.

<doc id="715004" wikidata="Q1437709" url="?curid=715004" title="Canción">
<text>Canción (&quot;song&quot;) is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish popular song forms, including tiranas, polos and boleros; also in Italian light operetta, French romanza, and the slow waltz. Initially, even when written by the creole population of Cuba, who opposed the ruling hierarchy, the music retained its European style of &quot;intricate melodies, and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics&quot;.

Later, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the canción came under the influence of the trovador movement. This resulted in the lyrical expression of the feelings and aspirations of the population. The accompaniment of the guitar followed naturally, and the canción gradually fused with other forms of Cuban (and therefore Latin American) music such as the bolero. As a distinguishing mark, though, the canción never has the full-blooded Afro-Cuban percussion which marks so much Cuban popular music.

&quot;Canción&quot; means &quot;song&quot; in Spanish. In the Renaissance, the term was often used interchangeably with cantiga, cantar, canson, and sometimes villancico; it was related to the chanson of the Franco-Flemish school. Canción was the least specific term to cover all the popular, secular styles of vocal music of Spain at the time. In Spanish-language concerts and recordings, when the title of a particular song does not belong to a danceable genre (such as son in Cuba, or chacarera in Argentina, its genre is mentioned as &quot;canción&quot;.

<doc id="715006" wikidata="Q839568" url="?curid=715006" title="Shell cordovan">
<text>Shell cordovan, cordovan, or cordwain is a type of tanned leather commonly used in high-end shoemaking. Cordovan is an equine material made from the superficial fascia (or &quot;shell&quot;) of the lower layers of the hide on the rump of a horse. The material derives its name from the city of Cordoba, Spain, which was long known as a center of leather production. It is a difficult and expensive material to make, and in the late 19th and early 20th century was mostly used for razor strops to hone razors in barber shops. More recently it has been increasingly used for shoes, wallets, and watch straps due to its visual appeal and exceptional durability. It is also used in archery to protect the fingers. It is smooth and durable, ideal for a finger tab. Shell cordovan has a unique non-creasing characteristic. Because it is made of connective tissue, it is smooth and lacks the pebbled effect of leather derived from the outer skin.

==Production==
After removal from the horse, the hide is measured from the root of the tail forward on the backbone. The hide is cut at right angles to the backbone and the resulting pieces termed a &quot;front&quot; (the forward part) and the &quot;butt&quot;. The term cordovan leather applies to the product of both the tanned fronts and tanned butts, but is especially used in connection with the term galoshes, meaning the vamps or boot-fronts cut from the shell of the butt.

After being tanned, leather from the &quot;front&quot; is typically used in the fabrication of gloves, or blackened, to be used in the tops of shoes. The &quot;butt&quot;, after tanning, is passed through a splitting-machine which removes the grain, or hair side, revealing what is termed the &quot;shell&quot;. The close fibers of the shell result in a smooth and pliable material used mostly in the manufacture of shoes. Other uses include watch straps and the manufacture of finger protection tabs for archerywhere it is prized for its toughness, longevity, and protective qualities.

<text>Aliʻiōlani Hale is a building located in downtown Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, currently used as the home of the Hawaiʻi State Supreme Court. It is the former seat of government of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and the Republic of Hawaiʻi.

Located in the building&#x27;s courtyard is the famed gold-leaf statue of Kamehameha the Great.

== Design and history ==
The Aliʻiōlani Hale was designed by Australian Thomas Rowe in an Italian Renaissance Revival as the royal palace for King Kamehameha V. In the Hawaiian language, &quot;Aliʻiōlani Hale&quot; means &quot;House of Heavenly Kings&quot;. The name &quot;Aliʻiōlani&quot; was also one of the given names of Kamehameha V.

Although the building was designed to be a palace, Kamehameha V realized that the Hawaiian government desperately needed a government building. At that time, the several buildings in Honolulu used by the government were very small and cramped, clearly inadequate for the growing Hawaiian government. Thus, when Kamehameha V ordered construction of Aliʻiōlani Hale, he commissioned it as a government office building instead of a palace.

Kamehameha V laid the cornerstone for the building on February 19, 1872. He died before the building was completed, and it was dedicated in 1874 by one of his successors, King David Kalākaua. At the time, Hawaiian media criticized the building&#x27;s extravagant design, suggesting that the building be converted into a palace as originally designed.

Until 1893, the building held most of the executive departments of the Hawaiian government as well as the Hawaiian legislature and courts.

== Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy ==
It was from Aliʻiōlani Hale in 1893 that the Committee of Safety, under the leadership of Lorrin A. Thurston, deposed Queen Liliʻuokalani by public proclamation.

After the establishment of the Hawaiian provisional government in 1893 and the Republic of Hawaiʻi in 1894, some of the offices in Aliʻiōlani Hale were moved to ʻIolani Palace, including the Hawaiian legislature. As a result, Aliʻiolani Hale became primarily a judicial building.

== Aliʻiōlani Hale since 1900 ==

The growing size of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s government continued to be a problem for the building, especially after Hawaiʻi became a United States territory in 1900. In 1911, the building was extensively renovated to help solve these space problems. The entire interior of the building was gutted and rebuilt, giving the building&#x27;s interior a completely new floorplan. Since the building was originally designed to be a palace, its floorplan was not adequate for its later usage as a judicial building. The new layout of the building fixed this problem.

The size of the territorial government continued to grow. In the 1940s, a new wing was added to the building to help alleviate the growing problem of overcrowding. The architects who designed the new wing tried to blend it in with the original building that dated back to the 1870s.

Over the next many decades, most of the state judiciary functions moved out of Aliʻiōlani Hale to various other buildings around Honolulu (including the state district, family, and circuit courts). Today, the building houses the Hawaiʻi State Supreme Court and is the administrative center of the Hawaiʻi State Judiciary. It also houses the Judiciary History Center, a museum featuring a multimedia presentation of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s judiciary, a restored historic courtroom, and other exhibits dealing with Hawaiʻi&#x27;s judicial history. The building also houses Hawaiʻi&#x27;s largest law library.

In December 2005, a capsule buried by Kamehameha V when he laid the cornerstone was located, at the direction of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, by Professor Larry Connors of the University of Denver using ground penetrating radar. The capsule contained photos of royal families and the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Hawaiian postage stamps, Hawaiian and foreign coinage, newspapers, a calendar and books. The capsule was located to protect it during future renovations, and not retrieved due to concerns of damaging the structure of the building itself.

Copper thieves stripped several copper downspouts from the building in 2006.

In the 2010 version of CBS&#x27; &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; TV series, Aliʻiōlani Hale is depicted as the Iolani Palace; headquarters for the Five-0 task force with exterior shots of the building being used frequently throughout the series.

Aliʻiōlani Hale is one of many buildings in downtown Honolulu listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Within walking distance are the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Hawaiʻi State Capitol, Hawaiʻi State Library, Honolulu Hale, ʻIolani Palace, Kawaiahaʻo Church, Territorial Building, and Washington Place.

== King Kamehameha V Judiciary History Center ==
The King Kamehameha V Judiciary History Center, located in Aliʻiōlani Hale, focuses on Hawaii&#x27;s legal history and landmark court cases. Admission is free and the public can tour the exhibits from Monday through Friday from 8am to 4pm. Group tours are offered by reservation.

<text>The English Football League Championship, known simply as the Championship and for sponsorship purposes as [[Sky Betting &amp; Gaming|Sky Bet]] Championship, is a professional football league in England and Wales. EFL Championship is the highest division of the English Football League (EFL) and second-highest overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League, and is contested by 24 clubs.

Introduced for the 2004–05 season as the Football League Championship, the division is a rebrand of the former Football League First Division, which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Second Division prior to the 1992 launch of the Premier League. The winning club of this division each season receives the EFL Championship trophy, which was the previous trophy awarded to the winners of the English top-flight prior to the launch of the Premier League. As with other divisions of professional English football, Welsh clubs can be part of this division, thus making it a cross-border league.

Each season, the two top-finishing teams in the Championship are automatically promoted to the Premier League. The teams that finish the season in third to sixth place enter a playoff tournament, with the winner also gaining promotion to the Premier League. The three lowest-finishing teams in the Championship are relegated to League One.

The Championship is the wealthiest non-top-flight football division in the world, the ninth-richest division in Europe, and the 12th best-attended division in world football (with the second highest per-match attendance of any secondary league – after the German 2.Bundesliga). Its average match attendance for the 2022–23 season was 18,787.

Cardiff City have spent more seasons in this division than any other team, and Bristol City, Preston North End and Queens Park Rangers currently hold the longest tenure in this division, having last been absent in the 2014–15 season. Barnsley became the first club to attain 1,000 wins in second-tier English league football with a 2–1 home victory over Coventry City on 3 January 2011. They also became the first club to play 3,000 games in second-level English league football following another 2–1 home victory, this time against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 12 March 2013 The current champions of the league are Leicester City.

==History==

Sunderland won the league in the first season since rebranding, with Wigan Athletic finishing second to win promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time in their history. They had only been elected to the Football League in 1978 playing in the fourth tier as recently as 1994 before their promotion. West Ham United won the first Championship play-off final that season, following a 1–0 victory over Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The 2004–05 season saw the division announce a total attendance (including postseason) of 9.8 million, the fourth-highest total attendance for a European football division, behind the Premier League (12.88 million), Spain&#x27;s La Liga (11.57 million) and Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga (10.92 million). Additionally, Millwall, competing in the inaugural Championship season, qualified for the UEFA Cup, only to lose in the first qualifying round. In the 2005–06 season, Reading broke the Football League points record for a season, finishing with 106 points, exceeding the record of 105 set by Sunderland in 1999.

Sunderland won their second Championship title in the 2006–07 season, after being relegated from the top division the previous season. On 4 May 2007, Leeds United became the first side since the re-branding of the division to enter administration; they were deducted 10 points and were relegated as a result. On 28 May 2007, Derby County won the first Championship play-off final at the new Wembley Stadium, beating West Bromwich Albion 1–0. West Brom would go on to win the Championship in the following season.

Burnley, who finished fifth in 2009, defeated Sheffield United to earn their first season in the newly branded Premier League, last being in the Football League First Division in 1976.

On 30 September 2009, Coca-Cola announced they would end their sponsorship deal with the Football League, which began in 2004, at the end of the 2009–10 season. On 16 March 2010, npower were announced as the new title sponsors of the Football League, and from the start of the 2010–11 Football League season until the end of the 2012–13 season, the Football League Championship was known as the &quot;Npower Championship&quot;. Crystal Palace became the second Championship club to enter administration in 2010.

After winning the 2011 League Cup final, Birmingham City became the first Championship club to compete in the group stage of the UEFA Cup/Europa League, finishing third in the group, only one point behind Portuguese club Braga. Birmingham City eventually finished fourth in the Championship that season, and would lose to fifth-place Blackpool in the play-off. Wigan Athletic became the second club to participate in the Europa League group stage after winning the 2013 FA Cup, only to accumulate one win and lose their last three group matches.

On 18 July 2013, UK bookmaker Sky Bet announced that they had signed a five-year agreement to sponsor the league.

On 24 May 2014, the Championship play-off final between Derby County and Queens Park Rangers saw the highest crowd for any Championship fixture – 87,348 witnessed a Bobby Zamora stoppage time winner for QPR to win promotion for the London club.

For the 2016–17 season, the Football League was rebranded as the English Football League. The league had a cumulative attendance of more than 11 million – excluding play-off matches – with more than two million watching Newcastle United and Aston Villa home fixtures alone, both of whom had been relegated from the Premier League in the previous season. This was included in the highest crowds for the second to fourth tier in England since the 1958–59 season. Newcastle won the title in 2016–17, while Aston Villa finished 13th, eventually returning to the Premier League in 2019.

On 13 March 2020, Championship play was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a suspension lasting until 4 April. It was then extended to the end of April, with the league eventually restarting on 20 June. Leeds United were confirmed as champions on 17 July 2020, being promoted to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years.

Brentford, having been in League Two in 2009 and gaining promotion to the Championship five years later, were promoted following a play-off victory against Swansea City on 29 May 2021, after losing the play-off to Fulham the previous year. On 29 May 2022, Nottingham Forest, having been in the Championship for 14 consecutive seasons, ended their 23-year absence from the top flight by beating Huddersfield Town in the play-off final, after being last in the league as late as round 8 of the 2021–22 season.

The EFL Championship took a unique four-week break in November and December 2022 to allow for players to join their national teams at the 2022 FIFA World Cup held in Qatar.

==League structure==
The league comprises 24 teams. Over the course of a season, which runs annually from August to the following May (in 2022, the year of a World Cup break in November and December, the league started in July), each team plays twice against the others in the league, once at &#x27;home&#x27; and once &#x27;away&#x27;, resulting in each team competing in 46 games in total. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and zero for a loss. The teams are ranked in the league table by points gained, then goal difference, then goals scored, and then their head-to-head record for that season (including away goals record). If two or more teams finish the season equal in all these respects, then teams are separated by alphabetical order, unless a promotion, relegation, or play-off place (see below) is at stake, when the teams are separated by a play-off game, though this improbable situation has never arisen in all the years the rule has existed.

At the end of the season, the top two teams and the winner of the Championship play-offs are promoted to the Premier League and the bottom three teams are relegated to EFL League One. The Football League Championship play-offs is a knock-out competition for the teams finishing the season in third to sixth place with the winner being promoted to the Premier League. In the play-offs, the third-placed team plays against the sixth-placed team and the fourth-placed team plays against the fifth-placed team in two-legged semi-finals (home and away). The winners of each semi-final then compete in a single match at Wembley Stadium with the prize being promotion to the Premier League and the Championship play-off trophy.

The EFL Championship is the second most-watched second-tier domestic sports league in the World, behind the German 2. Bundesliga (29,081), with an average of 23,048 spectators per game in the 2023–24 season. The Championship is the fifth most watched league in Europe.

The highest average league attendance was in 2023–24 season, when 12.7 million fans attended Championship matches, at an average of 23,048 per game. The lowest average league attendance came in the 2013–14 season, when 9.1 million spectators watched at an average of 16,605 per game. The highest seasonal average for a club was 51,106 for Newcastle United in the 2016–17 season.

==Historic performance==
Since the restructuring into the Championship in 2004, 57 teams have spent at least one season in the division, including 13 of the 20 teams in the 2024–25 Premier League. Cardiff City have spent the longest in the league with 19 seasons. The 15-season spell for Ipswich Town between 2004 and 2019 is the longest consecutive spell of any team in the division. The teams with the current longest tenure are Bristol City, Preston North End and Queens Park Rangers, who will each have their tenth consecutive season as a Championship team in the 2024–25 season. Norwich City has had six separate spells in the Championship; the most of any team. There have been 13 different winners of the EFL Championship, with seven teams (Burnley, Leicester City, Newcastle United, Norwich City, Reading, Sunderland and Wolverhampton Wanderers) having won it twice.

Burnley and Norwich City have been promoted out of the Championship on four occasions, with five teams (Fulham, Hull City, Sheffield United, Watford, West Brom) having been promoted on three occasions. Rotherham United have been relegated from the Championship the most times on five occasions, with Wigan Athletic having been relegated the second-most times on four occasions and two teams (Barnsley and Charlton Athletic) having been relegated on three occasions. 14 teams have been both promoted out of and relegated from the Championship.

<doc id="715010" wikidata="Q1191690" url="?curid=715010" title="Mount Haruna">
<text>is a dormant stratovolcano in Gunma Prefecture, in the Kantō region of eastern Honshū, Japan.

== Outline ==
Mount Haruna started to form more than 300,000 years ago and the last known eruption was 550 AD. The volcano has a summit caldera containing the symmetrical cinder cone of Mount Haruna-Fuji, along with a crater lake, Lake Haruna, along the western side. To the west of the lake is Mount Kamonga, the tallest of Mount Haruna&#x27;s numerous peaks at high.

The lake and the area to its east, as well as the southern and southwestern slopes, lie within the borders of Takasaki city. The border of Shibukawa city (to the east) nearly approaches Lake Haruna. Both Shinto village and Yoshioka town are on the southeast slopes of the mountain. The northern and northwestern slopes lie within Higashi Agatsuma town, which also bounds Lake Haruna. The summit lies on the border of Takasaki and Higashi Agatsuma.

Mount Haruna, along with Mount Akagi and Mount Myōgi, is one of the &quot;Three Mountains of Jōmō.&quot; (Jōmō is an old name for Gunma.)

==In popular culture==
The Japanese battlecruiser/Battleship Haruna was named after the Mount Haruna.

The mountain was made famous in the manga series &quot;Initial D&quot; under the fictional name Akina (秋名), where the main character, Takumi Fujiwara, delivers tofu every day to a hotel uphill, and back down using his father&#x27;s highly modified Toyota Sprinter Trueno (AE86). It is also where Takumi won his first few races. It is the home course for the racing team called the Akina Speed Stars with which Takumi becomes closely associated. Later in the anime Takumi, due to his unbeatable track records and for his downhill driving technique, is popularly referred to as &#x27;Akina&#x27;s 86&#x27;.

The mountain is featured in the PlayStation 2 games &quot;Kaido Battle&quot;, &quot;Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction&quot; and &quot;Kaido Battle: Touge no Densetsu&quot;. It is also featured in the PC games &quot;Race Driver: GRID&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot;, although not realistically.

<doc id="715013" wikidata="Q205104" url="?curid=715013" title="Department of Puno">
<text>Puno () is a department and region in southeastern Peru. It is the fifth largest department in Peru, after Cuzco, Madre de Dios, Ucayali, and Loreto. It is bordered by Bolivia on the east, the departments of Madre de Dios on the north, Cusco and Arequipa on the west, Moquegua on the southwest, and Tacna on the south. Its capital is the city of Puno, which is located on Lake Titicaca in the geographical region known as the Altiplano or high sierra.

Puno was the territory of the Tiahuanacos (800 A.D. – 1200 A.D.), who were the highest cultural expression of the Aymara people who established themselves in what is today Peru and Bolivia. The Incas took over these lands in the fifteenth century, and the Spanish, attracted by the mining industry developed there, left an important Colonial legacy throughout the entire area.

==Geography==

The department of Puno is located in the Collao Plateau. The western part of Lake Titicaca, which is the world&#x27;s highest navigable lake, is located in the department. The Andean mountains make up 70% of the region&#x27;s territory, and the rest is covered by the Amazon rainforest.

The lake contains numerous islands whose inhabitants continue to live as their ancestors have in custom and tradition. The Uros an example of this; this people group lives on &quot;floating islands&quot; that they have artificially made entirely of totora reeds, and they navigate in their traditional boats also made out of totora reeds. Taquile, Suasi, and Amantaní are known for their kindness of their residents, their ancestral skill in weaving, their pre-Columbian constructions, and lovely countryside. The Titicaca National Reserve (36,180 hectares) protects extensive stretches of totora reeds and various species of plants and animals.

The climate is cold and dry, with a four-month rain season. On the other hand, the climate of the rainforest is warm. The water resources are taken from the Lake Titicaca, 50 lagoons and more than 300 rivers. There is also an important potential in underground waters.

==Political division==
The region is divided into 13 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 107 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

* Azángaro (Azángaro)
* Carabaya (Macusani)
* Chucuito (Juli)
* El Collao (Ilave)
* Huancané (Huancané)
* Lampa (Lampa)
* Melgar (Ayaviri)
* Moho (Moho)
* Puno (Puno)
* San Antonio de Putina (Putina)
* Sandia (Sandia)
* San Román (Juliaca)
* Yunguyo (Yunguyo)

==History==

In ancient times, the Collao plateau was inhabited by Aymara groups (Collas or Qolla, Zapanas, Kallahuayos and Lupacas). The Quechuas came later.

According to chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, these ancient times coincide with the legend of Manco Cápac and Mama Ocllo, who emerged from the waters of Lake Titicaca to found the Inca Empire.

The Aymara culture, also known as Putina, was the most important and influential pre-Hispanic culture in the region.

During the Viceroyship, Puno was the obliged route for travelers going to Potosí, Bolivia. In 1668, viceroy Conde de Lemos established San Juan Bautista de Puno as the capital of the province of Paucarcolla. Later, it was called San Carlos de Puno, in honor of the ruling king, Charles II of Spain. The town was the capital of the Intendancy of Puno.

In 1870, the railway route Arequipa-Puno was installed and navigation in Lake Titicaca started.

In 2007, a meteorite landed in the region, triggering a widespread illness amongst the locals. The exact cause of the illness is unknown, but is speculated to be a result of arsenic or other toxic chemicals that may have been released by the heat of impact.

==Language and ethnicity==
Indigenous people are the majority in the Puno region. , 41.4% of Puno&#x27;s inhabitants speak Quechua, 30.39% speak Aymara; 0.05% speak Ashaninka; and 0.03% speak another indigenous language. Monolingual Spanish speakers make up 28.1% of the population.

According to the 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents was Quechua (38.01%) followed by Spanish (34.81%) and Aymara (26.93%). The Quechua variety spoken in Puno is Cusco–Collao Quechua. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Puno Region by province:

==Tourism==

Tourism is currently expanding in the Puno Region, with several tour operators and hotels ranging from low budget hostels to high-end hotels.

<text>Deathstroke is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, the character first appeared in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #2 (December 1980) as Deathstroke the Terminator.

In his comic book appearances, Slade Wilson is a former U.S. Army operative who gains enhanced physical and mental abilities from an experimental super-soldier serum and becomes the mercenary Deathstroke. Widely considered the greatest and deadliest assassin in the DC Universe, he serves as the archenemy of Dick Grayson and the Teen Titans, and is also an adversary of other superheroes such as Batman, Green Arrow, and the Justice League. Deathstroke&#x27;s vendetta against the Titans began when he swore revenge for the death of his eldest son Grant; his other two children, Jericho and Rose, would go on to join the Titans to oppose him. A bicolored black-and-orange mask that covers his missing right eye serves as Deathstroke&#x27;s visual motif.

Deathstroke has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in television by Manu Bennett in &quot;Arrow&quot; and Esai Morales in &quot;Titans&quot;, and by Joe Manganiello in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Justice League&quot; and its director&#x27;s cut. Ron Perlman and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice in animation and video games. The character’s popularity with readers also led Rob Liefeld to create the popular Marvel Comics character Deadpool, whose name, powers, and costume were originally patterned on Deathstroke.

==Publication history==
Deathstroke the Terminator was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, and made his first appearance in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #2 in December 1980.

Due to his popularity, Deathstroke received his own series, &quot;Deathstroke the Terminator&quot;, in 1991. It was retitled &quot;Deathstroke the Hunted&quot; for issues #0 and #1–45; and then simply &quot;Deathstroke&quot; for issues #46–60. The series was cancelled with issue #60. In total, &quot;Deathstroke&quot; ran for 65 issues (#1–60, plus four &quot;Annuals&quot; and a special #0 issue).

Following his injury in &quot;DC Universe: Last Will and Testament&quot;, Deathstroke appears in one of the four &quot;Faces of Evil&quot; one-shots, written by David Hine.

Despite predating James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;The Terminator&quot; by four years, the character is now simply called Deathstroke, though the full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as &quot;Justice League Elite&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

Slade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age. After participation in the Korean War, he was assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.

Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with a drug that allowed him to utilize and use up to 90% of his brain&#x27;s capacity granting him enhanced physical powers and near-mastery control of his body (accelerated healing-factor and heightened senses) in an attempt to create metahuman super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend Wintergreen, who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge. However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor.

A criminal named Jackal took his younger son Joseph Wilson hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph&#x27;s throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph&#x27;s vocal cords and rendering him mute.

After taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eye patch to cover his eye.

===The Teen Titans===
Slade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the H.I.V.E., dubbed himself Ravager, and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans. However, Grant&#x27;s enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from S.T.A.R. Labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone. The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded Beast Boy in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.

Deathstroke next appeared in New York, holding officials hostage to lure the Titans into confronting him. Terra, a new ally of the Titans, and Beast Boy were the only ones available to answer the call. Terra knocked Beast Boy out and fought Deathstroke single-handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a Titan. Deathstroke escaped as the other Titans arrived, but by then Terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership. Later that night, it was revealed that Terra and Deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team.

===The Judas Contract===
During &quot;The Judas Contract&quot;, the Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. Donna Troy was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, Victor Stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, Starfire was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and Raven was taken down by Terra herself. Nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself. He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at Titans Tower to discover Slade&#x27;s ex-wife and son. She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.

Nightwing, to confront Deathstroke and H.I.V.E., joined Jericho (Joseph Wilson). During the confrontation, Deathstroke recognized Jericho as his son, which caused him to hesitate. Jericho freed the Titans by possessing his father&#x27;s body. After Terra died during the battle, Slade was then taken into custody.

Slade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Changeling so that he could kill Slade himself, believing that he was responsible for Terra&#x27;s betrayal of the Titans. Slade agreed to the confrontation, but showed up out of costume. Changeling found himself unable to kill Slade, so instead they talked. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Changeling realized that Slade was not to blame for the choices that Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms, with Slade returning to Africa with Wintergreen.

===Titans Plague===
Months later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. Donna Troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier. He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away. Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.

===Titans Hunt===
Shortly after this, he came to the Titans&#x27; assistance again during the &quot;Titans Hunt&quot; storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the &quot;Judas Contract&quot;. Mento, an on-and-off member of the Doom Patrol, hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the Wildebeest Society, and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke&#x27;s son.

It was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of Azarath, as they were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho&#x27;s true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho&#x27;s heart, seemingly killing him.

Afterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional ally to the Titans, aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry, most notably during the &quot;Total Chaos&quot; storyline when the Team Titans arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot Lord Chaos. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former cop who would become the new Vigilante. Pat Trayce became Slade&#x27;s lover later on, and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship.

===Family business===
After Slade foiled an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade&#x27;s friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and Sarge Steel, Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.

Meanwhile, Slade&#x27;s relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn, as Slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (but this power is limited, as Slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor). After gaining this power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This alteration of her DNA drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state.

In &quot;Titans&quot; #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state had revived the H.I.V.E. and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho&#x27;s apparent death. During the battle, interrupted by Vandal Savage and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titans battles, Adeline&#x27;s throat was slit. In a brief return of sanity, she begged Slade to kill her, requesting him to reunite her with &quot;my... &quot;our&quot; children...&quot; because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound, but only allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand&#x27;r shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely, per Adeline&#x27;s wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of Starfire&#x27;s act.

It was then revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death. Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor and confidant Wintergreen. He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering Impulse&#x27;s knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father&#x27;s body. Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child Rose Wilson into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, to find and kill Jericho, using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge. Unfortunately, the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane, to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him.

===&quot;Nightwing&quot; and &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;===
Deathstroke appeared in &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 2) #23 as a mercenary against Black Canary and Conner Hawke as part of the &quot;Brotherhood of the Fist&quot; tie-in to the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; story arc.

Deathstroke also appeared in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #22–24, where he was sent to Gorilla City by Blockbuster to get an ape-heart. He is accompanied by Lady Vic, Grimm, and Black Canary, who is posing as Oracle.

===&quot;Identity Crisis&quot;===
In the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for Doctor Light, who was being pursued by the Justice League of America as a suspect in the murder of Sue Dibny. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of Elongated Man, Flash, Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Atom and Green Lantern. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring&#x27;s energies using his own formidable willpower. But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke&#x27;s right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape. Near the end of &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade&#x27;s cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade&#x27;s eye socket. The note reads &quot;This is yours – we&#x27;re not done.&quot;

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
Deathstroke was a founding member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline. He was seen in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #1, hiding in a warehouse south of Metropolis waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters with several other members. The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the Phantom Lady. Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death).

He was the employer of Nightwing, whom he hired to train his daughter Rose. However, after the two have a confrontation with Superman, Deathstroke discovers that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism. He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter, because doing so would undo all of Slade&#x27;s teachings. Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the metahuman villains out of Blüdhaven. The deal held for 34 hours until &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #4, when Slade, under the orders of Alexander Luthor Jr., the real leader of the Society, went with several villains (including old Titans and Doom Patrol foes and Brotherhood of Evil members Monsieur Mallah and Brain) to drop Chemo on Blüdhaven, killing over 100,000 people. Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again.

Nightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and Rose&#x27;s training session, revealing to the latter that the kryptonite that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to Kryptonians. Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him. Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him. Nightwing disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for Blüdhaven.

At the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Slade was confronted by Batman, Robin and Nightwing. During the struggle, he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society. His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory; Batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor, and Nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him. Enraged, Slade said that was because of Nightwing, and that it was always because of him, before Batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

Slade appears in the &quot;Green Arrow&quot; series after the one year jump in DC Comics&#x27; storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several Star City businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.

However, things do not quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, trapping him within a ring of armed National Guardsmen. The fight ends with Deathstroke&#x27;s arrest and subsequent conviction and incarceration; however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to Constantine Drakon, another jailed foe of Green Arrow who has information on the hero&#x27;s activities in the lost year, which include Green Arrow studying under Natas, an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.

Deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as Titans East. The current Titans team included Ravager, who now wanted nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke seemingly intended to &quot;reclaim&quot; Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that failed, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he specially selected each member of Titans East, believing that, overall, each member would successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up.

As indicated over the course of the subsequent issues, Deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He had blackmailed former Titan Risk while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage, was drugging Batgirl with the same serum he had used on Rose, and supplied Inertia with a formula that granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the Speed Force following the initial battle with Superboy-Prime. His team, however, slowly fell apart over the course of the attack, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum and Raven convinced Duela Dent to switch sides. Slade and his remaining Titans subsequently faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he was defeated, he still managed to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it was revealed to the readers that Slade&#x27;s real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them: a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans. By attacking the Titans, he insured that Rose and Jericho would become more trusted by their associates, and thus grow closer to the team.

Recently, Deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting (through unknown means) the powers of Geo-Force, the half-brother of the original Terra, into the same powers as his traitorous sister. Using this leverage, Deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if Geo-Force became his own personal spy within the Justice League. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, Geo-Force alerted Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman of Deathstroke&#x27;s scheme, which culminated in Geo-Force alerting the League that Deathstroke (whose rivalry with Green Arrow had reached vendetta-level proportions) planned on using an army of supervillains to crash Green Arrow and Black Canary&#x27;s wedding. Weeks later, Geo-Force was tortured by Gorilla Grodd after the League was kidnapped by the Injustice League, and ultimately transferred to Batman&#x27;s newest incarnation of the Outsiders afterward, robbing Deathstroke of his potential pawn.

Deathstroke can be seen as a member of Libra&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

Deathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by Geo-Force in &quot;DC Universe: Last Will and Testament&quot;. Following his injury, he is recuperating at Belle Reve while doctors labor to save him. Deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down. When he awakens, he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past.

Ravager comes to visit him, but in fact, wants to finish her father off. She tries to strangle him with a plastic wire, but Deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack. He escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter. Later, Deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
In the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) tie-in to the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen&#x27;s house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.

The two hopelessly fight the regenerating Black Lanterns until Jericho, cured from his earlier insanity, arrives and turns the tide of the fight. During the course of the battle, Deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the Teen Titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him, they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail. Just as Slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed, Jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the Black Lanterns and their power rings, permanently sending them back to the grave. After realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive, and leaves after threatening to kill Slade if he tries to stop her. Jericho chooses to stay with his father, reasoning that only Slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness.

===&quot;Batman and Robin&quot;===
Recently, Deathstroke has been seen working with Talia al Ghul, controlling the body and physical actions of the current Robin to kill the recent Batman. Deathstroke is able to control Robin&#x27;s actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin&#x27;s spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke&#x27;s enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a &#x27;trailer&#x27; for what he will do later.

===&quot;Titans: Villains for Hire&quot;===
Following the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of Tattooed Man, Cheshire, Osiris, and the new character Cinder following the launch of &quot;Brightest Day&quot;. The team ambushes Ryan Choi in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan&#x27;s chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero&#x27;s body to Dwarfstar.

Following the assassination of the Atom, Deathstroke and the Titans are hired to kill Lex Luthor during his stay in Midway City. The attack is revealed to be a ruse crafted by Slade and Luthor to draw out a traitor on Luthor&#x27;s security staff, who is revealed to be a shape-shifting assassin named Facade. After the Titans capture Facade and turn him over to the scientists at LexCorp, Luthor rewards Slade by examining technology that he had earlier ordered Tattooed Man and Cheshire to steal. Slade claims that this will bring him one step closer to his true goal: the ability to somehow cheat death itself. He also succeeds in recruiting Arsenal, a former member of the Teen Titans and Justice League, into the team. Shortly after inducting Arsenal into the team, Slade accepts a mission to rescue a child from a drug lord named Elijah. After discovering that Elijah is using the bodies of kidnapped children to create an addictive drug called Bliss, the Titans promptly kill the gangster and shut down his operation. As the Titans are preparing to return to the Labyrinth, Cheshire notices that Slade has tied up DJ Molecule, a powerful metahuman who was working for Elijah as a bodyguard. When asked what he is doing with the young man, Slade cryptically responds by saying that he only accepted the mission to capture Molecule for some unknown purpose.

Afterward, Slade and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader Drago over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Arsenal, and Cheshire betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago. While Slade is held captive, Drago arrives and reveals to him that he is actually Slade&#x27;s old friend, Corporal Daniel Rogers, who abandoned him during the civil war in Afghanistan. Drago then gouges out Slade&#x27;s left eye making him blind. Slade is then imprisoned along with Arsenal and begins to tell him about his past with Drago. Later, Drago takes a trip down memory lane with Slade, explaining how he lost his sight, and basically re-telling his origin and how it involved Jeremiah, right before he throws Slade beneath the complex to fend for his life against a crazed subhuman. During the fights, Slade&#x27;s left eye was restored due to his metahuman healing factor, and the Titans arrive to rescue him. Slade and the Titans break into Drago&#x27;s mansion and attack. Slade drugs Drago so that he cannot focus his telepathic powers. When Drago is defeated, Slade allows him to live and the Titans then leave his island. While returning to the labyrinth, Slade and the Titans are approached by the Atom and the Justice League, who attempt to arrest them for the murder of Ryan Choi.

During the battle of Slade&#x27;s Titans against the Justice League in Khandaq, the battle was stopped by Isis, who forces them to choose between leaving or continuing the fight and starting &quot;World War III&quot;. The Justice League chose to retreat and Slade retrieves a sample of Supergirl&#x27;s Kryptonian blood. Upon returning to the labyrinth, with his workers, Doctor Sivana and Doctor Impossible, Slade reveals to the Titans that their efforts support creation of a diabolical invention called the &quot;Methuselah Device&quot; for his dying son Jericho.

The machine successfully heals Jericho, and Slade offers its abilities to all the Titans, offering to restore their deceased loved ones as payment for their services. All agree but Cinder, who does not want her brothers to live forever, as she claims to be doing. She attacks Cheshire and Osiris, and is then joined by Tattooed Man and Arsenal. As the Titans come to blows, Deathstroke attempts to take Jericho and leave, but Jericho, disgusted at what his father did to achieve his restoration, takes over his body, intending to destroy first the Methuselah Device, then himself and Deathstroke. While the Titans fight over the Methuselah Device, its power source, a metahuman named DJ Molecule, is released. DJ Molecule blasts Slade, knocking Jericho out of his body. Arsenal then attacks him for stealing the Titans&#x27; legacy. Slade escapes and the Methuselah Device is destroyed by Cinder. Afterwards, Slade berates himself and becomes Deathstroke once more.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world. Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain Clayface, Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode – namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive. During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy. Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father&#x27;s hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him.

Slade takes a contract from Harvest, to bring the Ravagers back to the colony. He does this in exchange for his daughter Rose and Terra. It turns out that Lynch, the leader of Team 7 had needed Terra to stop a rampaging Majestic, who was thought to be killed by Dinah Drake&#x27;s sonic scream. For a plan B, to Slade&#x27;s dismay, he calls in Joseph Wilson, now going by the name Jericho, with Adeline and Grant, to stop Majestic. Instead of stopping Majestic, Jericho takes control of Majestic, Adeline, Grant, and Terra to kill his father. Adeline dies, buried in the rubble caused by Majestic&#x27;s stampede. Jericho momentarily loses control by this time, and Slade, Rose, and Terra manage to restrain Majestic, with the help of Rose&#x27;s Gen-factor. However, Jericho retains control over Grant and Terra. When Slade knocks Terra unconscious, a cornered Jericho threatens to stab himself and Grant with a sword. Deathstroke, without hesitation, drives the sword into both of them, killing them instantly. But a later scene suggests Jericho has escaped, since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean-up scene, strongly implying Jericho has possessed the man to flee.

====Origins====
Deathstroke&#x27;s altered origin is introduced in &quot;Deathstroke&quot; (vol. 2) #0. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen, was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.

This origin was again changed in &quot;Teen Titans: Deathstroke&quot; #1. After a mission that involved destroying a children&#x27;s hospital which Slade was unaware of, he quit the army. After Team 7&#x27;s termination, Slade started to operate under the Deathstroke identity. He took Grant on his mission, considering him as not only his son, but as a business partner, and the only person he could trust. But during a mission in North Korea, their refuge was infiltrated and North Korean soldiers barged in, firing into the house. Grant was shot, and as Slade looked back at his son, a bullet penetrated his right eye, blinding it. Enraged, Slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers. However, Grant was presumed dead. Now, Slade works for the sake of his daughter Rose, as he knows the only thing that will keep Rose safe after he is gone is money. It is unclear if Rose&#x27;s mother is Adeline or not.

====Team 7====
Five years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with &quot;Team 7&quot;. With metahuman threats rising, &quot;The Majestic Project&quot;, a plan to control future metahuman threats, was devised by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the Eclipso Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center. Hank Henshaw is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including Caitlin Fairchild. Team 7 is sent to the spot. Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door. Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson&#x27;s Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, Dinah Drake, and Cole Cash had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch. Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected.

Team 7&#x27;s last mission was to salvage Pandora&#x27;s Box. The Team, with new pilot Steve Trevor is sent to Gamorra. The Kaizen, who possessed Pandora&#x27;s Box, prepared to unleash its power. When they reach the Kaizen&#x27;s palace, the child precogs show the Team a future where Kaizen Gamorra has opened the Box and the whole world is going off the rails. Hearing the precogs say the Kaizen had to be stopped to prevent this fate, Majestic flies up into space, and impacts the coast of Gamorra with the force of a comet, creating a massive tidal wave, annihilating five million residents. But the Kaizen&#x27;s palace stood however, and the team couldn&#x27;t defeat him, until Majestic burst in. The Kaizen explains that Majestic is the key to opening the box, which also explains why he targeted Bronson in the first place. Majestic kills the Kaizen with a single blow. But he subdues to the Box&#x27;s power, and starts attacking the team. Dinah lets out a canary cry that destroys the entire palace. In the chaos, Lynch is possessed by the box, but Amanda Waller knocks the box from his hands and tells Dinah to take the box away as far as possible. Lynch tries to take down the helicopter containing Dinah and the remaining team agents, but Waller shoots him from behind, seemingly killing Lynch and leading to Team 7&#x27;s dissolution.

====Forever Evil====
During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, Copperhead, and Shadow Thief at the White House when he is looking for the President. Later, the party turns up in Wayne Industries with Power Ring to fight Batman, Lex Luthor, and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate. Deathstroke has Lex Luthor&#x27;s life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth. Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him. After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over. Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate he is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower. The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed. Deathstroke witnesses the only &quot;hero&quot; from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities. Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor.

===DC Rebirth===
&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; is a comic book publishing initiative launched by DC Comics in May 2016. It was designed to be a relaunch of the entire DC Comics line, following the conclusion of the &quot;New 52&quot; era that began in 2011. DC Rebirth aimed to bring back many of the classic elements and characters that had been missing or altered during the New 52 era, while also introducing new storylines and characters. The initiative featured a mix of ongoing series and limited series, with some series continuing from the New 52 era and others starting fresh with new creative teams.

Deathstroke, along with Lady Shiva, is mentioned as one of the enemies that Batman thinks may be attacking him on Two-Face&#x27;s orders. He also stars in an ongoing series about his exploits as a mercenary and his tumultuous relationship with his ex-wife and children as well introducing Hosun Park, Slade&#x27;s son-in-law and hacker. During one such operation, he comes into contract with the Red Lion/Matthew Bland, the President/Dictator of the African nation of Buredunia. Bland offers him a high sum for making sure his competition does not bring in US forces, and later takes one of Slade&#x27;s Promethium suits for himself. Later, Slade attempts to save his son Grant from dying in battle with the Teen Titans by using Speed Force energy drained from Kid Flash to time travel. He becomes trapped in the Speed Force in the process, but is rescued the Titans and Teen Titans. The experience moves him to give up being Deathstroke, so he builds a team of heroes called Defiance, with both his children, Wintergreen, Adeline Kane, and Wallace as his teammates. It was later disbanded after Power Girl took her own life, and Slade&#x27;s attempts have grown worse to himself.

Deathstroke was later imprisoned in Arkham Asylum, though he escapes and is later captured by the new Damian Wayne&#x27;s new roster of Teen Titans. In a bid to fulfill his death-wish, he releases all the inmates that Robin had been locking up illegally to attack the group. He tried to goad Damian into killing him, but he was instead killed by Red Arrow. Shortly afterwards, a funeral was held by all the villains. At his funeral, Raptor gave Slade&#x27;s body leprosy, which sent his healing ability into overdrive and resurrected him. He took his resurrection as a second chance in life and went into hiding as a doctor. 

=== Infinite Frontier ===
Deathstroke teamed up with Black Canary to work with an organization called T.R.U.S.T. They both realized that the organization was led by Secret Society of Super Villains and Deathstroke kicks Black Canary out to take control of it, naming it Deathstroke Inc. He meets Rose Wilson and Respawn, a boy made from his and Talia&#x27;s DNA who resembled Damian Wayne. He was framed for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s murder by Geo-Force who wanted revenge on Talia and Deathstroke. During the conflict, Deathstroke is killed by Talia Al Ghul but is resurrected by his followers using a Lazarus Pit. 

In &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;, Deathstroke is possessed by the Great Darkness and attempts to destroy the multiverse. He is eventually defeated and has the Darkness exorcised from his body, losing his powers in the process. Deathstroke is hospitalized in the Hall of Justice, but a mysterious figure deactivates his life support and leaves him to die. However, he is later revealed to be alive.

== Characterization ==
Christopher Priest, the writer of Deathstroke&#x27;s self-titled solo series in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, has said:

Deathstroke is widely regarded as one of the most feared and deadly professional assassins in the world with a considerable seven figure fee and a six figure deposit. He is infamous for completing nearly all of his contracts, having only failed his contract with H.I.V.E. to kill the Teen Titans. He uses his resources to hire lawyers to prevent law enforcement from proving that Slade Wilson and Deathstroke are the same person. Deathstroke has been described as being emotionally crippled, believing everyone else to be &quot;idiots&quot; and struggling to commit despite desperately loving his children and desiring closeness with them. He is a poor father and often suffers from past choices made between his children and wife, Adeline.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Slade Wilson was given an experimental super-soldier serum that increased his physical and mental abilities to superhuman levels, granting him enhanced strength, speed, stamina, agility, durability, reflexes, and senses. Deathstroke also possesses a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. Despite stating that he can only heal non-fatal injuries, he has shown to heal from severe organ trauma such as impalement and bullet wounds to the brain. These regenerative abilities have given him a slowed aging process and extended longevity, in addition to a resistance to toxins. While Deathstroke was originally stated to be able to use up to 90% of his brain&#x27;s capacity, it was later clarified that his brain processes information nine times more efficiently than an ordinary human&#x27;s. Deathstroke also has an eidetic memory and has been described as a tactical genius with a strategic mind rivaling that of Batman.

Even prior to acquiring his powers, Deathstroke mastered numerous hand-to-hand combat and martial art forms as well as swordsmanship and marksmanship as part of his elite training in the military. His arsenal of weapons include various swords, firearms, knives, and a ballistic staff capable of firing bolts of energy from each end.

<text>The English Football League Two, simply known as League Two and for sponsorship purposes as [[Sky Betting &amp; Gaming|Sky Bet]] League Two, is a professional football league in England. EFL Two is the third division of the English Football League (EFL) and fourth-highest tier overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League, EFL Championship and the EFL League One and is contested by 24 clubs.

Introduced for the 2004–05 English football season as Football League Two, it is a rebrand of the former Football League Third Division, which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Fourth Division prior to the 1992 launch of the Premier League.

As of the 2024–25 season, Newport County hold the longest tenure in this division following their promotion in the 2012–13 season. There are currently two former Premier League clubs competing in this division: Bradford City (1999–2001) and Swindon Town (1993–94).

The current holders are Stockport County.

==Structure==
There are 24 clubs in this division. Each club plays each of the other clubs twice (once at home and once away) for a total of 46 matches per season and is awarded three points for a win, one for a draw and no points for a loss. From these points a league table is constructed.

At the end of each season the top three teams, together with the winner of the play-offs between the teams which finished in the fourth to seventh positions, are promoted to EFL League One and are replaced by the four teams that finished at the bottom of that division.

Similarly, the two teams that finished at the bottom of League Two are relegated to the National League and are replaced by the team that finished first and the team that won the second through seventh place play-off in that division. Technically a team can be reprieved from relegation if the team replacing them does not have a ground suitable for League football, but in practice this is a non-factor because every team currently in the National League has a ground that meets the League criteria (and even if they did not, a ground-sharing arrangement with another team could be made until their stadium was upgraded). The other way that a team can be spared relegation is if another team either resigns or is expelled from the EFL.

Final league position is determined, in order, by points obtained, goal difference, goals scored, a mini-league of the results between two or more teams ranked using the previous three criteria, and finally a series of one or more play-off matches.

There is a mandatory wage cap in this division that limits spending on players&#x27; wages to 55% of club turnover.

<text>The chain (abbreviated ch) is a unit of length equal to 66 feet (22 yards), used in both the US customary and Imperial unit systems. It is subdivided into 100 links. There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile. In metric terms, it is 20.1168 m long. By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer.

The chain has been used since the early 17th century in England, and was brought by British settlers during the colonial period to other countries around the globe. In the United Kingdom, there were 80 chains to the mile, but until the early nineteenth century the Scottish and Irish customary miles were longer than the statute mile; consequently a Scots chain was about 74 (imperial) feet, an Irish chain 84 feet. These longer chains became obsolete following the adoption of the imperial system of units in 1824. In India, &quot;metric chains&quot; of exactly are used, along with fractions thereof.

==Definition==
The UK statute chain is 22 yards, which is . This unit is a statute measure in the United Kingdom, defined in the Weights and Measures Act 1985. One link is a hundredth part of a chain, which is .

The surveyor&#x27;s chain first appears in an illustration in a Dutch map of 1607, and in an English book for surveyors of 1610. In 1593 the English mile was redefined by a statute of Queen Elizabeth I as 5,280 feet, to tie in with agricultural practice. In 1620, the polymath Edmund Gunter developed a method of accurately surveying land using a surveyor&#x27;s chain 66 feet long with 100 links. The 66-foot unit, which was four perches or rods, took on the name the chain. By 1675 it was accepted, and Ogilby wrote:
From Gunter&#x27;s system, the chain and the link became standard surveyors&#x27; units of length and crossed to the colonies. The thirteen states of America were expanding westward and the public land had to be surveyed for a cadastral. In 1784 Thomas Jefferson wrote a report for the Continental Congress proposing the rectangular survey system; it was adopted with some changes as the Land Ordinance of 1785 on 20 May the following year. In the report, the use of the chain as a unit of measurement was mandated, and the chain was defined. 


==Modern use and historic cultural references==
===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the chain is no longer used for practical survey work. However, it is still used on the railways as a location identifier. When railways were designed, the location of features such as bridges and stations was indicated by a cumulative longitudinal &quot;mileage&quot;, using miles and chains, from a zero point at the origin or headquarters of the railway, or the originating junction of a new branch line. Since railways are linear in topology, the &quot;mileage&quot; or &quot;chainage&quot; is sufficient to identify a place uniquely on any given route. Thus, a given bridge location may be indicated as 112 miles and 63 chains (181.51 km) from the origin. In the case of the photograph, the bridge is near Keynsham, which is that distance from London Paddington station. The indication &quot;MLN&quot; after the mileage is the Engineer&#x27;s Line Reference describing the route as the Great Western Main Line, which is needed to uniquely determine the bridge, as there may be points at 112 miles 63 chains on other routes.

On new railway lines built in the United Kingdom such as High Speed 1, the position along the alignment is still referred to as &quot;chainage&quot;, although the value is now expressed in metres.

===North America===
The use of the chain was mandatory in laying out US townships. A federal law was passed in 1785 (the Public Land Survey Ordinance) that all official government surveys must be done with a Gunter&#x27;s (surveyor&#x27;s) chain. Chains and links are commonly encountered in older metes and bounds legal descriptions. Distances on township plat maps made by the US General Land Office are shown in chains.

Under the US Public Land Survey System, parcels of land are often described in terms of the section (), quarter-section (), and quarter-quarter-section (). Respectively, these square divisions of land are approximately 80 chains (one mile or 1.6 km), 40 chains (half a mile or 800 m), and 20 chains (a quarter mile or 400 m) on a side.

The chain is still used in agriculture: measuring wheels with a circumference of 0.1 chain (diameter ≈ 2.1 ft or 64 cm) are still readily available in Canada and the United States. For a rectangular tract, multiplying the number of turns of a chain wheel for each of two adjacent sides and dividing by 1,000 gives the area in acres.

In Canada, road allowances were originally 1 chain wide and are now 20 metres.

The unit was also used in mapping the United States along train routes in the 19th century. Railroads in the United States have long since used decimal fractions of a mile. Some subways such as the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro were designed with and continue with a chaining system using the 100-foot engineer&#x27;s chain.

In the United States, the chain is also used as the measure of the rate of spread of wildfires (chains per hour), both in the predictive National Fire Danger Rating System as well as in after-action reports. The term &quot;chain&quot; is used by wildland firefighters in day-to-day operations as a unit of distance.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In Australia and New Zealand, most building lots in the past were a quarter of an acre, measuring one chain by two and a half chains, and other lots would be multiples or fractions of a chain. The street frontages of many houses in these countries are one chain wide—roads were almost always wide in urban areas, sometimes or . Laneways would be half a chain (10.1 m). In rural areas the roads were wider, up to where a stock route was required. roads were surveyed as major roads or highways between larger towns, roads between smaller localities, and roads were local roads in farming communities. Roads named Three Chain Road etc. persist today.

The &quot;Queen&#x27;s Chain&quot; is a concept that has long existed in New Zealand, of a strip of public land, usually 20 metres (or one chain in pre-metric measure) wide from the high water mark, that has been set aside for public use along the coast, around many lakes, and along all or part of many rivers. These strips exist in various forms (including road reserves, esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, marginal strips and reserves of various types) but not as extensively and consistently as is often assumed.

===Cricket pitches===
The chain also survives as the length of a cricket pitch, being the distance between the stumps.

==Measuring instruments==
Civil engineers and surveyors use various instruments including chains to measure distance. Other instruments used for measuring distance include tapes and bands. A steel band is also known as a &quot;band chain&quot;.

===Surveyors&#x27; chain (Gunter&#x27;s chain) ===
In 1620, the polymath Edmund Gunter developed a method of accurately surveying land using a 100 link chain, 22 yards (66 feet) long, called the Gunter&#x27;s Chain. Other surveyors chains have been used historically.

=== Engineer&#x27;s chain (Ramsden&#x27;s chain)===
A longer chain of , with a hundred links, was devised in the UK in the late 18th century by Jesse Ramsden, though it never supplanted Gunter&#x27;s chain. Surveyors also sometimes used such a device, and called it the &quot;engineer&#x27;s chain&quot;.

=== or Texas chain===
In the Southwestern United States, the &quot; chain&quot; also called the &quot;Texas chain&quot;, of 20 (16.9164 m , or  ft) was used in surveying Spanish and later Mexican land grants, such as the major Fisher–Miller and Paisano Grants in Texas, several similarly large ones in New Mexico, and over 200 smaller in California.

===Metric chains===
Metric chains, of lengths 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 30 m, are widely used in India. Tolerances are ±3 mm for 5 m and 10 m chains, ±5 mm for a 20 m chain, and ±8 mm for a 30 m chain.

====Revenue chain====
In India, a revenue chain with 16 links and of length is used in cadastral surveys.

===Other instruments===
Also in North America, a variant of the chain is used in forestry for traverse surveys. This modern chain is a static cord (thin rope) 50 metres long, marked with a small tag at each metre, and also marked in the first metre every decimetre. When working in dense bush, a short axe or hatchet is commonly tied to the end of the chain, and thrown through the bush in the direction of the traverse.

Another version used extensively in forestry and surveying is the &quot;hip-chain&quot;: a small box containing a string counter, worn on the hip. The user ties off the spooled string to a stake or tree and the counter tallies distance as the user walks away in a straight line. These instruments are available in both feet and metres.

==Use in popular culture==
The lyrics of Three Chain Road, by Lee Kernaghan, include the line &quot;He lived out on the three chain road&quot; which is the name of many Australian roads; referring to the width of the road reserve.

<text>The Casualties are an American punk rock band from New York City, founded by vocalist Jorge Herrera, Hank Fischer (guitar), Colin Wolf (vocals), Mark Yoshitomi (bass) and Yureesh Hooker (drums) in 1990. In July 2017, it was announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that original frontman Jorge Herrera had officially retired from touring. As of 2022, the band consists of members Jake Kolatis (guitarist), Marc Meggers (drums), Doug Wellmon (bass), and David Rodriguez (vocals).

== History ==
=== Early years (1990–1998) ===
The Casualties were formed in 1990, with original members Jorge Herrera (vocals), Hank (guitar), Colin Wolf (vocals), Mark Yoshitomi (bass) and Yureesh Hooker (drums). The members aimed to return to what they viewed as the &quot;golden era&quot; of street punk, embodied by bands such as The Exploited and Charged GBH, which they believed had disappeared by 1985. During the early years, the lineup was fluid, with several changes.

In early 1991, Hank left the band and was replaced by Fred Backus on guitar to record &quot;Political Sin&quot; in March 1991 for the &quot;Benefit for Beer&quot; compilation. Soon more changes were in the works, with new guitarist Fred heading off to school. C Squat&#x27;s Scott temporarily filled Fred&#x27;s shoes until he returned a short time later. During this period, guitarist Hank filled in for a couple of shows, and Steve Distraught also played briefly with the group on second guitar. 

The Casualties stabilized long enough to record their first demo in the fall of 1991, and the “40 Oz Casualty” EP in the spring of 1992, and was building up a fan base in their hometown of New York City. At the end of 1992, Mark and Fred left the band and were replaced by Mike Roberts on bass and Jake Kolatis on the guitar, followed by the departure of Yureesh and Colin in 1994, to be replaced on drums by Shawn, while the band went down to a single vocalist. 1994 saw the recording of the four-song EP, &quot;Drinking Is Our Way of Life;&quot; however, it would not be released. The songs would later appear on the Casualties &quot;The Early Years: 1990-1995&quot; album in 1999. In 1995, the band&#x27;s second release, the four-track &quot;A Fuckin&#x27; Way of Life&quot; EP was released on Eyeball Records. After recording &quot;A Fuckin&#x27; Way of Life,&quot; Shawn left the band, and Marc Eggers (nicknamed Meggers) of the Rivits became the regular drummer. The line-up of Jorge, Jake, Mike and Meggers continued until 1997.

In 1996 the Casualties became the first American band to appear at the &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot; Festival in London. 1997 saw the release of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;For the Punx&quot; on Tribal War Records, and the band embarked on its first American tour with The Varukers. Mike (the bassist) left the band in 1998, to be replaced with Johnny Rosado, from The Krays. They released their second LP that year, &quot;Underground Army,&quot; and began a world tour. Jon left the band during the European leg of the tour, to be temporarily replaced by Dave Punk Core.

=== Later years (1998–2017) ===

After the world tour, Dave would be replaced by Rick Lopez from the band Manix. The line-up was now solidified for the band. The end of the millennium, 1999, saw the band produce a compilation album, &quot;Early Years 1990–1995&quot;, which included tracks which appeared on earlier EPs, as well as never before released songs, such as the four songs they had recorded on the never released EP &quot;Drinking Is Our Way of Life&quot; back in 1994.

The 2000s have seen the band to continue to tour and produce albums (an album list can be seen below). They have toured with several other bands, such as The Exploited, GBH, Cockney Rejects, Slaughter &amp; the Dogs, and the English Dogs. In December 2009, The Casualties toured alongside Hatebreed, The Acacia Strain, Crowbar, and Thy Will Be Done as part of the Stillborn Fest. In the summer of 2012, The Casualties co-headlined the Tonight We Unite tour along with Nekromantix, where they played For the Punx in its entirety, the first time they had played the album through since its release in 1997. Later that year, The Casualties released their new album titled &quot;Resistance&quot; through Season of Mist. In 2013, The Casualties played at the largest punk rock festival in the world, the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, England, where they shared the stage with The Exploited, Special Duties, Chron Gen and Anti-Establishment, and others.

=== &quot;Chaos Sound&quot;, departure of Herrera, and new member (2016–2022) ===
On January 22, 2016, the band released their tenth studio album titled &quot;Chaos Sound&quot;. The album was recorded in Orange County, California at Buzzbomb Studio, produced by Paul Miner and released by Season of Mist. It is the last album to feature original vocalist Jorge Herrera.

While no longer associating with The Casualties, there have been no incidents to indicate that there is any bad blood between Herrera and the remaining or current members of The Casualties. Frontman of The Krum Bums, David Rodriguez officially replaced Herrera, changing the band&#x27;s line-up for the first time in 19 years. Guitarist Jake Kolatis and drummer Meggers are the two remaining long term members of the band.
=== Departure of Rick Lopez, and new member (2022–present) ===
On October 7, 2022, Rick Lopez announced on his Instagram account that he would be taking a &quot;-needed break&quot; and starting a new life, without giving further details about his departure from the band. The Casualties&#x27; official account, when consulted by Rick, only limited itself to saying that he was no longer a member of the band. Neither party provided details of his departure but they continue to interact on social media.

<text>The English Football League One, known as Sky Bet League One for sponsorship purposes or simply League One is a professional football league in England. EFL One is the second-highest division of the English Football League and the third-tier overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League and the EFL Championship and is contested by 24 clubs.

Introduced in the 2004–05 English football season as Football League One, it is a rebrand of the former Football League Second Division, which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Third Division before the 1992 launch of the Premier League.

Shrewsbury Town currently hold the longest tenure in the division following promotion from League Two at the end of the 2014–15 season. There are eight former Premier League clubs currently competing in this division; Barnsley (1997–98), Birmingham City (2002–06, 2007–08 and 2009–11), Blackpool (2010–11), Bolton Wanderers (1995–96, 1997–98, and 2001–12), Charlton Athletic (1998–99 and 2000–07), Huddersfield Town (2017–19), Reading (2006–08 and 2012–13), and Wigan Athletic (2005–13).

==Structure==
There are 24 clubs in this division. Each club plays each of the others twice. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. At the end of the season a table of the final League standings is determined, based on the following criteria in this order: points obtained, goal difference, goals scored, an aggregate of the results between two or more clubs (ranked using the previous three criteria), most matches won, most goals scored away from home, fewest &quot;penalty points&quot; based on yellow and red cards received, followed by fewest straight red cards for certain offenses. If two or more teams are still tied after examining all of these criteria, they will share the higher place between them. The only exception would be if the tied teams span the boundary between 2nd and 3rd, 6th and 7th, or 20th and 21st place, in which case one or more play-off matches would be arranged between the tied clubs.

At the end of each season the top two clubs, together with the winner of the play-offs between the clubs which finished in the third to sixth positions, are promoted to EFL Championship and are replaced by the three clubs that finished at the bottom of that division.

Similarly, the four clubs that finished at the bottom of EFL League One are relegated to EFL League Two and are replaced by the top three clubs and the club that won the fourth to seventh place play-offs in that division.

==Current members==

==Attendances==

EFL League One is the most-watched third-tier domestic sports league in the world, with an average of 10,613 spectators per game in the 2022–23 season, also making it one of the top ten most watched leagues in Europe. The closest third-tier association football league in terms of average attendance is the Germany 3. Liga (8,219). 

The highest average attendance since the restructure into League One was the 2022–23 season, when over 5.3 million spectators watched games, with an average of 10,613 per game. The highest average attendance by a single club was Sunderland in the 2018–19 season with 32,157. They also set the League One attendance record for a single game in the same season, when 46,039 spectators attended the Boxing Day game against Bradford City.

== Historic performance ==
Since the restructuring into League One in 2004, 78 teams have spent at least one season in the division, including 8 of the 20 teams in the 2024–25 Premier League. Milton Keynes Dons has spent 15 seasons in League One, the most of any team. Oldham Athletic&#x27;s single 14-season consecutive spell was the longest of any team. The team with the current longest tenure is Shrewsbury Town, who will be in their tenth consecutive season in the division, having been in League One since the 2015–16 season. Rotherham United have had the highest number of separate spells in League One with six. There have been 17 different Champions of League One, with Wigan Athletic having won the division three times.

==Financial Fair Play==
Beginning with the 2012–13 season, a Financial Fair Play arrangement has been in place in all three divisions of the Football League, the intention being eventually to produce a league of financially self-sustaining clubs. In League One, this takes the form of a Salary Cost Management Protocol in which a maximum of 60% of a club&#x27;s turnover may be spent on players&#x27; wages, with sanctions being applied in the form of transfer embargoes.

<doc id="715048" wikidata="Q757354" url="?curid=715048" title="Atlee Pomerene">
<text>Atlee Pomerene (December 6, 1863 – November 12, 1937) was an American Democratic Party politician and lawyer from Ohio. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio for a few months in 1911 and then represented Ohio in the United States Senate from 1911 until 1923.

==Early life==
Atlee Pomerene was born on December 6, 1863, in Berlin, Holmes County, Ohio, to Elizabeth and Peter P. Pomerene. He graduated with high honors from Princeton University in 1884. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1886 and was admitted to the bar in Ohio.

==Career==
In 1886, he began practicing law with Charles R. Miller in Canton, Ohio. He then entered a partnership with Judge Robert S. Shields in the firm Shields and Pomerene. He then organized the firm Pomerene, Ambler and Pomerene with Ralph Ambler and his brother Celsus Pomerene. From 1887 to 1901, he served as the city solicitor of Canton. He then worked as prosecutor of Stark County from 1897 to 1900. He prosecuted the homicide case against Anna George for the murder of George Saxton, brother of Ida Saxton McKinley. In 1906, he was appointed a member of the honorary tax commission of Ohio by Governor Andrew L. Harris. In 1910, he was chairman of the state Democratic convention.

After serving in a variety of city, county, and state positions as solicitor and prosecutor, Pomerene was elected the 31st lieutenant governor of Ohio in 1910. He briefly served in the post until January 19, 1911, when he was elected by the State Legislature to the U.S. Senate, succeeding Charles W. F. Dick. In 1913, he was a member of the Senate Banking Currency Commission and assisted in developing the legislation to create the Federal Reserve. Pomerene was re-elected in 1916, defeating Myron T. Herrick. He narrowly lost a bid for a third term six years later to Simeon D. Fess. He ran again the following election, but lost to Frank B. Willis. In 1923, he joined the law firm Squire, Sanders and Dempsey of Cleveland. In March 1923, President Warren Harding named him to the 5th Pan-American Conference held in Santiago, Chile. He was a Democrat.

Pomerene was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge alongside Owen Roberts to serve as a special prosecutor to deal with the Teapot Dome scandal. He ran unsuccessfully for the other U.S. Senate seat from Ohio in 1926 and for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. presidency in 1928. On August 1, 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Pomerene to succeed Charles G. Dawes as head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation after Dawes&#x27; sudden resignation on June 7. He served in that role until his retirement on March 4, 1933.

Pomerene then continued practicing law in Cleveland.

==Personal life==

Pomerene married Mary H. Bockius, daughter of L. V. Bockius, of Canton on June 29, 1892.

Pomerene died following pneumonia and a stroke in Cleveland on November 12, 1937, and was buried in Westlawn Cemetery in Canton.

==Awards and legacy==
Pomerene received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Miami University, Wooster University and Mount Union College. He also received an honorary degree from Kenyon College.

<doc id="715051" wikidata="Q638572" url="?curid=715051" title="Ardās">
<text>The Ardās (, pronunciation: ) is a set prayer in Sikhism. It is a part of worship service in a Gurdwara (Sikh temple), daily rituals such as the opening the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; for &quot;prakash&quot; (morning light) or closing it for &quot;sukhasan&quot; (night bedroom) in larger Gurdwaras, closing of congregational worship in smaller Gurdwaras, rites-of-passages such as with the naming of child or the cremation of a loved one, daily prayer by devout Sikhs and any significant Sikh ceremonies. 

An Ardas consists of 3 parts. The first part recites the virtues of the ten Gurus of Sikhism from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, starting with lines from &quot;Chandi di Var&quot; from the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;. The second part recites the trials and triumphs of the Khalsa and petition. The third salutes the divine name. The first and the third part are set and cannot be changed, while the second part may vary, be shortened and include a supplication such as seeking divine help or blessing in dealing with daily problems, but is usually in agreed form. While it is sung, the audience or the Sikh devotee typically stands, with folded hands, many with bowed headed, with some typically saying &quot;Waheguru&quot; after certain sections.

Ardas is attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the founder of the Khalsa and the 10th Guru of Sikhism.

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ardas is related to the Sanskrit word &quot;ard&quot; (अर्द) which means &quot;request, ask, beg&quot;. It is also related to the Persian word &quot;arzdasht&quot; which means a written &quot;petition made by an inferior to a superior&quot;.

==Structure==
The Ardās is usually always done standing up with folded hands and is commonly preceded by the eighth stanza of the fourth ashtapadi of the bani Sukhmani, beginning &quot;Tu Thakur Tum Peh Ardaas&quot;. It consists of three parts:
#The beginning of the Ardās is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh and may not be altered or omitted. It appears as the opening passage of Var Sri Bhagauti Ji Ki (see Chandi di Var). The first part is an invocation from the &quot;Chandi di Var&quot; and recites the virtues of the Sikh Gurus.
#The second part is several paragraphs recounting Sikh symbols, places or worship and values significant and related to Khalsa. This may be changed by reciting a &quot;short ardaas&quot;. The Sikh devotee may include a personal prayer such as &quot;Waheguru, please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake&quot; when starting a new task, help me with this problem, or add any personal petition for God. 
#The third salutes the divine name. This part may also not be altered or omitted. 

The end of the Ardaas (&quot;Nanak Nam Chardi Kala, Tere Bhane Sarbat Da Bala&quot;, &quot;O Nanak, may the Nam (Holy) be ever in ascendance! in Thy will may the good of all prevail!&quot;) is also set and may not be altered or omitted.

==Origins==

The &quot;Ardās&quot; of Sikhism was first composed by Guru Gobind Singh. He fixed the first eight lines and the last section, and these are considered unalterable in Sikhism. The second section has been fluid, revised extensively and particularly by Tat Khalsa in the 20th century. The Sikh Rahit Maryada has published an approved version of the entire Ardas.

<text>Charles William Frederick Dick (November 3, 1858 – March 13, 1945) was a Republican politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.

==Early life==
Born in Akron, Ohio, his parents were Gottlieb Dick (a Scots/German immigrant), and Magdalena or &quot;Lena&quot; (Von Handel) Dick, who immigrated to the United States from Heidelberg, Germany. On June 30, 1881, Dick married Carrie May Peterson, the daughter of Dr. James Holman Peterson and Caroline Van Evera. They had five children: James, Lucius, Carl, Grace (Mrs. Edgar Williams) and Dorothy (Mrs. William Robinson). Dick was a Scottish Rite Mason, Odd Fellow, and Knight of Pythias.
==Career==
===Early career===
&quot;Charley&quot; Dick was educated in Akron, and worked at several stores and banks. In 1886, he was the successful Republican nominee for Summit County auditor, and he was re-elected in 1888. He also read law, and was admitted to the bar in 1894. Dick was a delegate to the 1892, 1896 and 1900 Republican National Conventions. He was elected Chairman of the Ohio Republican Party in 1887 and 1891, and served as the Secretary of the Republican National Committee from 1896 to 1900.

===Military career===
In November 1885 Dick joined the Ohio Army National Guard as a private in Company B, 8th Ohio Infantry Regiment, and he was commissioned as a first lieutenant a few days later. His regiment volunteered for service in the Spanish–American War, and Dick served in Cuba as a major and lieutenant colonel. He continued his military service after the war, and attained the rank of major general as head of the Ohio National Guard. From 1902 to 1909 he was president of the National Guard Association of the United States.

===Congressional career===
He was elected to the United States House of Representatives by a special election in 1898 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Stephen A. Northway, serving the .

Dick was Chairman of the Militia Committee, and sponsored the Militia Act of 1903 (the Dick Act). This act codified the circumstances under which the National Guard in each state could be federalized, provided federal resources for equipping and training the National Guard, and required National Guard units to organize and meet the same readiness requirements as the regular Army.

Dick served until he resigned in 1904, having been elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the death of Marcus A. Hanna.

In the Senate he served as chairman of the Mining Committee and the Committee on Indian Depredations. He also was the head of a Congressional Committee which investigated hazing at the United States Military Academy. He served until 1911, when he lost a bid for a second term.

While in Congress, he became one of the largest stockholders in the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and served as a vice president and member of the board of directors.

===Later career===
Dick practiced law after leaving the Senate, and pursued a successful business career, including ownership of the Franklin Square Hotel in Washington, D.C., and the Hotel Chatham in New York City.

He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 1918, losing to Martin L. Davey. In 1922 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, losing to Simeon D. Fess.

==Retirement, death and burial==
From 1941 until his death in Akron on March 13, 1945, Dick was the oldest living former US Senator. He was buried in Akron&#x27;s Glendale Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Since 1988 the National Guard Association of the United States presents the annual Charles Dick Medal of Merit to recognize support for the National Guard by state and federal legislators.

<text>A church service (or a worship service) is a formalized period of Christian communal worship, often held in a church building. Most Christian denominations hold church services on the Lord&#x27;s Day (offering Sunday morning and Sunday evening services); a number of traditions have mid-week services, while some traditions worship on a Saturday. In some Christian denominations, church services are held daily, with these including those in which the seven canonical hours are prayed, as well as the offering of the Mass, among other forms of worship. In addition to this, many Christians attend services on holy days such as Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, Ascension Thursday, among others depending on the Christian denomination.

The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the &quot;Word of God&quot; (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the &quot;church&quot; in &quot;church service&quot; refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the physical place in which it takes place. In most Christian traditions services are presided over by clergy wherever possible, but some traditions utilize lay preachers. Styles of service vary greatly, from the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Reformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian), and Lutheran traditions of liturgical worship to informal worship characterized by certain free church traditions, common among Methodists and Baptists, that often combine worship with teaching for the believers, which may also have an evangelistic component appealing to backsliders and the non-Christians in the congregation (cf. altar call). Quakers and some other groups have no formal outline to their services, but allow the worship to develop as the participants present feel moved.

==History==
The worship service is a practice of Christian life that has its origins in Jewish worship. Jesus Christ and Paul of Tarsus taught a new form of worship of God. As recorded in the gospels, Jesus met together with his disciples to share teachings, discuss topics, pray, and sing hymns. The holding of church services pertains to the observance of the Lord&#x27;s Day in Christianity.

The Bible has a precedent for a pattern of morning and evening worship that has given rise to Sunday morning and Sunday evening services of worship held in the churches of many Christian denominations today, a &quot;structure to help families sanctify the Lord&#x27;s Day.&quot; In and , &quot;God commanded the daily offerings in the tabernacle to be made once in the morning and then again at twilight&quot;. In Psalm 92, which is a prayer concerning the observance of the Sabbath, the author writes that &quot;It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night&quot; (cf. Psalm 134:1). Church father Eusebius of Caesarea thus declared: &quot;For it is surely no small sign of God&#x27;s power that throughout the whole world in the churches of God at the morning rising of the sun and at the evening hours, hymns, praises, and truly divine delights are offered to God. God&#x27;s delights are indeed the hymns sent up everywhere on earth in his Church at the times of morning and evening.&quot;

The first miracle of the Apostles, the healing of the crippled man on the temple steps, occurred because Peter and John went to the Temple to pray (Acts 3:1). Since the Apostles were originally Jews, the concept of fixed prayer times, as well as services therefore which differed from weekday to Sabbath to holy day, were familiar to them. Pliny the Younger (63 – ), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed prayer times by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: &quot;They met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity[...] after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.&quot;

The real evolution of the Christian service in the first century is shrouded in mystery. By the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of formalised, regular services: the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and prayers at the third hour of the day (terce), the sixth hour of the day (sext), and the ninth hour of the day (none). The concept of major hours of prayer corresponding to the first and last hour of the day likely correspond to Jewish practices; that Sunday services (corresponding to the Sabbath in Christianity) are more complex and longer (involving twice as many services if one counts the Eucharist and the afternoon service) also likely have root in Jewish practices. Similarly, the liturgical year from Christmas via Easter to Pentecost covers roughly five months, the other seven having no major services linked to the work of Christ. Though worship services had their origins in Jewish services, it is unlikely that Jewish services were copied or deliberately substituted (see Supersessionism).

===Contemporary church services===
Contemporary worship services have their origins in the Jesus Movement of the 1960s. In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music, comprising a variety of musical styles, such as Christian rock and Christian hip-hop was adopted by evangelical churches. Over the years, the organs have been replaced by pianos, electric guitars and drums. These contemporary worship services feature a sermon based on the Bible. Worship service in Evangelical churches is seen as an act of God&#x27;s worship. It is usually run by a Christian pastor. It usually contains two main parts, the praise and the sermon, with periodically the Lord&#x27;s Supper.
 During worship there is usually a nursery for babies. Prior to the worship service, adults, children and young people receive an adapted education, Sunday school, in a separate room. With the 1960s&#x27; charismatic movement, a new conception of praise in worship, such as clapping and raising hands as a sign of worship, took place in many evangelical denominations. In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music, including a wide variety of musical styles, such as Christian Rock and Christian Hip hop, appeared in the praise. Some churches have services with traditional Christian music, others with contemporary Christian music, and some offer both in separate services. In the 2000s and 2010s, digital technologies were integrated into worship services, such as the video projectors for broadcasting praise lyrics or video, on big screens. The use of social media such as YouTube and Facebook to retransmit live or delayed worship services, by Internet, has also spread. The offering via Internet has become a common practice in several churches. In some churches, a special moment is reserved for faith healing with laying on of hands during worship services. Faith healing or divine healing is considered a legacy of Jesus acquired by his death and resurrection. The taking up of tithes and offerings (gifts made beyond the tithe) is a normative part of the worship services. The main Christian feasts celebrated by the Evangelicals are Christmas, Pentecost, and Easter for all believers, among others depending on Christian denominations (cf. evangelical feasts).
===Quaker meeting for worship===

Quakers (the Religious Society of Friends), like other Nonconformist Protestant denominations, distinguish between a church, which is a body of people who believe in Christ, and a &#x27;meeting house&#x27; or &#x27;chapel&#x27;, which is a building where the church meets. Quakers have both unprogrammed and programmed meetings for worship. Unprogrammed worship is based on waiting in silence and inward listening to the Spirit, from which any participant may share a message. In unprogrammed meetings for worship, someone speaks when that person feels that God/Spirit/the universe has given them a message for others. Programmed worship includes many elements similar to Protestant services, such as a sermon and hymns. Many programmed meetings also include a time during the service for silent, expectant waiting and messages from the participants.

==Common features==

Vocal music is traditionally sung by a choir or the congregation (or a mixture of the two), usually accompanied by an organ. Sometimes other instruments such as piano, classical instruments, or modern band instruments may be part of the service, especially in churches influenced by the contemporary worship movement. Some churches are equipped with state-of-the-art multi-media equipment to add to the worship experience. The congregation may sing along in hymnals or words to hymns and worship songs may be displayed on a screen. More liturgical denominations may have the words to specific prayers written in a missalette or prayer book, which the congregation follows. Though most of the services are still conducted in church buildings designed specifically for that purpose, some services take place in &quot;store front&quot; or temporary settings.

For those unable to attend a service in a church building a burgeoning televangelism and radio ministry provides broadcasts of services. A number of websites have been set up as &quot;cyber-churches&quot; to provide a virtual worship space free to anyone on the internet. Church services are often planned and led by a single minister (pastor) or a small group of elders or may follow a format laid out by the dictates of the denomination. 

Some churches are &quot;lay led&quot; with members of the congregation taking turns guiding the service or simply following format that has evolved over time between the active members. More commonly, an ordained minister will preach a sermon (which may cover a specific topic, or as part of a book of the Bible which is being covered over a period of time). Depending on the church, a public invitation follows whereby people are encouraged to become Christians, present themselves as candidates for baptism or to join the congregation (if members elsewhere), or for other purposes. Many congregations begin their church services with the ringing of a bell (or a number of bells); a current trend is to have an introductory video which serves as a &quot;countdown&quot; to the beginning of the service. The service usually involves the singing of hymns, reading of scripture verses and possibly a psalm. If the church follows a lectionary, the sermon will often be about the scripture lections assigned to that day. Eucharistic churches have usually Holy Communion either every Sunday or several Sundays a month. Less liturgical congregations tend to place a greater emphasis on the sermon. Many churches will take up a collection of money (offertory) during the service. The rationale for this is taken from , , and . But some churches eschew this practice in favor of voluntary anonymous donations for which a box or plate may be set up by the entrance, or return-address envelopes may be provided that worshippers may take with them. Offering through the Internet has become a common practice in many evangelical churches. On occasion, some churches will also arrange a second collection, typically occurring after Communion, for a specific good cause or purpose.

Some churches offer Sunday school classes. These will often be for younger children, and may take place during the whole of the service (while the adults are in church), or the children may be present for the beginning of the service and at a prearranged point leave the service to go to Sunday school. Some churches have adult Sunday school either before or after the main worship service.

Following the service, there will often be an opportunity for fellowship in the church hall or other convenient place. This provides the members of the congregation a chance to socialize with each other and to greet visitors or new members. Coffee or other refreshments may be served.

===Types of church service===
Church services take many forms, and set liturgies may have different names. Services typically include:

*Regular Sunday services. These are a part of most traditions. Holy Communion may be celebrated at some or all of these; often it is included either once a month or once a quarter. A few denominations have their main weekly services on Saturday rather than Sunday. Larger churches often tend to have several services each Sunday; often two or three in the morning and one or two in the late afternoon or evening, as well as on Saturdays. Some churches have begun to provide religious services conducted through internet technology, for the benefit of those who cannot attend for health or other reasons, or who may want to preview the church before attending in person.
*Midweek services. Again, Holy Communion can be part of these, either on every occasion or on a regular basis.
*Holiday services. Treated like a regular Sunday service, but made more specific for the day.
*Weddings. These are normally separate services, rather than being incorporated into a regular service, but may be either.
*Funerals. These are always separate services. 
*Baptisms. These may be incorporated into a regular service, or separate.
*Confirmation. This is normally incorporated into a regular Sunday service, which will also include communion. It was traditionally the first Communion of the confirmee, but more recently, children are invited to communion in some denominations, whether confirmed or not.
*Ordination of clergy. New bishops, elders, priests and deacons are usually ordained or installed generally in a solemn but celebratory ceremony on Saturday or Sunday, generally open to the public, either by their own superior or by another approved senior minister with ordination powers. The service is held either at the area headquarters church or cathedral or at another church agreed upon by those to be ordained and the ordaining ministers. Ordination of bishops or elders may require consecration by more than one individual and have a more limited audience. 
*First Communion. Children may celebrate Communion for the first time.
*Opening of new churches or church buildings.
*Dedication of new missionaries or those about to be sent on new missions.

== Places of worship ==

Places of worship are usually called &quot;churches&quot; or &quot;chapels&quot;. Some services take place in theaters, schools or multipurpose rooms, rented for Sunday only.

==Attire==
Christians have historically tended to wear modest clothes at church services (cf. 1 Timothy 2:9–10). Men have traditionally removed their caps while praying and worshipping, while women have traditionally worn a headcovering while praying and worshipping (cf. 1 Corinthians 11:1–11). These practices continue to be normative in certain churches, congregations, and denominations, as well as in particular parts of the world, such as in Eastern Europe and in the Indian subcontinent, while in the West, attention to these observances has waned generally (apart from those denominations that continue to require them, such as Conservative Anabaptist churches). In many nondenominational Christian churches, it may be customary, depending on the locality, for people to be dressed casually.

<text>Sir Reginald Stephen Garfield Todd (13 July 1908 – 13 October 2002) was a liberal Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia from 1953 to 1958 and later became an opponent of white minority rule in Rhodesia.

==Background==
Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. He was educated at Otago University, Glen Leith Theological College, and the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1932 he married Jean Grace Wilson, with whom he had three daughters. 
Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. One of the primary-school teachers in his charge was Robert Mugabe. Though he had no formal medical training, Todd and his wife, Grace, set up a clinic where he delivered hundreds of babies and treated minor injuries. His ranch, Hokonui, was named after the hills in his home province of Southland.

==Political involvement==
In 1948 Todd won election to parliament. He succeeded Sir Godfrey Martin Huggins as leader of the United Rhodesia Party and Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in 1953 when Huggins became the inaugural Prime Minister of the newly established Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953. 

From 1955 to 1960 Todd served as first vice-president of the World Convention of Churches of Christ.

==Government==

Todd introduced modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. His government introduced a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. He doubled the number of primary schools and gave grants to missionary-run schools to introduce secondary school and pre-university courses for blacks.

He also introduced the appellation &quot;Mr&quot; for blacks instead of &quot;AM&quot; (&quot;African Male&quot;) and ended the prohibition on the sale of alcohol to black residents of the reserves, who were allowed to drink European beer and wine, though not spirits.

Todd pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly, allowing for multiracial trade unions, thereby undercutting the growing white nationalist influence in the unions. Lastly, in a bid to increase the number of blacks eligible to vote from 2% to 16% of the electorate, he moved to lower property and education qualifications, but this was rejected. 
In response, Todd&#x27;s ministers resigned en bloc, and following the appointment of a new cabinet, his party forced him out of power; three months later he was replaced as party leader and Prime Minister by Edgar Whitehead.

In a farewell statement, he said &quot;We must make it possible for every individual to lead the good life, to win a place in the sun. We are in danger of becoming a race of fear-ridden neurotics – we who live in the finest country on Earth.&quot;

In addition to prime ministership, Todd was Minister of Finance and several other portfolios. He was granted retention of the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; in October 1958, for having served more than three years on the executive council.

==Later life==
After helping to co-ordinate the isolation and embargo of Rhodesia, and especially after his support for legitimising guerrilla activity by black nationalists, Todd was widely condemned as a traitor by white Rhodesians. When the Smith Government was ultimately forced to give up power and the nation became the independent state of Zimbabwe in 1980, Todd was immediately considered for appointment to the new black government for his &quot;collaborating&quot; role. Lord Soames, following the recommendation of Prime Minister-elect Robert Mugabe, appointed Todd to the Senate on 8 April 1980, where Todd served until his retirement in 1985. After years of supporting Mugabe, Todd became disillusioned with the new regime due to its blatant violence against political opponents. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to Africa and New Zealand, by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1986 New Year Honours, at the instigation of the New Zealand government.

During retirement, Todd donated of his ranch to former guerillas who had been maimed in the Rhodesian Bush War. Nonetheless, Todd&#x27;s criticism of Mugabe intensified and, in 2002, he was stripped of Zimbabwean nationality. He died, aged 94, on 13 October 2002, in Bulawayo.

<doc id="715108" wikidata="Q1395876" url="?curid=715108" title="Thomas Morris (Ohio politician)">
<text>Thomas Morris (January 3, 1776December 7, 1844) was an American politician from Ohio who served in the United States Senate and was a member of the Democratic Party. In the 1844 presidential election, he was the vice presidential nominee of the anti-slavery Liberty Party.

==Biography==
Morris was born in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and enlisted as a Ranger to fight the Indians in 1793. He settled in western Ohio two years later. Morris began practicing law in Bethel, Ohio in 1804.

==Career==
On May 12, 1806, shortly after the beginning of the 1806–1807 term of the Ohio House of Representatives, Morris contested the election of David C. Bryan and was awarded the seat from Clermont County.

Morris served in the Ohio State House of Representatives for Clermont County in 1806–1807, 1808–1809, 1810–1811, and 1820–1821. He served as Justice of the Ohio State Supreme Court in 1809. He was then a member of the Ohio State Senate for Clermont County in 1813–1815, 1821–1823, 1825–1829 and 1831–1833.

He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1833, and served a single term. He did not seek re-election. He was nominated to the Vice Presidency by the Liberty Party in 1844 under James G. Birney. The ticket came in third after Democratic candidate James Knox Polk and Whig Party candidate Henry Clay.

==Family life==
Morris was the father of Isaac Newton Morris and Jonathan David Morris.

==Death==
He died December 7, 1844.

== Legacy ==
Author and prominent American Civil War historian Eric Foner argues in his seminal book &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men&quot; that Sen. Morris is one of the most significant figures in the anti-slavery movement and the &quot;first political martyr of the anti-slavery cause when he was denied re-election to the Senate because of his abolitionist convictions.&quot; He also argues that Morris &quot;awakened (Salmon Chase) to the character of the Slave Power and to the need for political organization to combat its influences,&quot; leading the way for the term &quot;Slave Power&quot; to enter the American political jargon and paving the way for the creation of the Republican Party.

<text>SS &quot;Cuba was a [[Passenger ship|passenger]] and [[Cargo ship|cargo]] [[steamship]] that was wrecked in 1923 off the coast of [[California]]. Her remains are now a [[wreck diving]] site. She was launched in [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1897 as Coblenz for [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] (NDL), who owned and operated her until the [[United States]] seized her in 1917. The [[United States Shipping Board]] took possession of her and renamed her Sachem&quot;. In 1920 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company bought her and renamed her &quot;Cuba&quot;.

==Building==
In 1897 NDL took delivery of a trio of sister ships for its route between Bremen and South America. Blohm+Voss in Hamburg launched &quot;Coblenz&quot; on 18 March, and completed her on 5 May. Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Bremerhaven launched &quot;Mainz&quot; on 15 May, and completed her on 8 July. Schichau Seebeckwerft in Bremerhaven launched &quot;Trier&quot; on 5 June, and completed her on 15 June.

&quot;Coblenz&quot;″s registered length was , her beam was and her depth was . Her tonnages were and . As built, she had berths for 20 passengers in First class and 232 in Third Class.

&quot;Mainz&quot; had twin screws, each driven by a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine the combined power of her twin engines was rated at 280 NHP, and gave her a speed of .

==NDL service==
NDL registered &quot;Coblenz&quot; at Bremen. Her code letters were QGJW. In May 1897 she began her maiden voyage, which was to Santos in Brazil. In September 1900 she made a voyage from Bremen to Baltimore. In 1903 NDL put &quot;Coblenz&quot;, &quot;Mainz&quot;, and &quot;Trier&quot; on its route between Bremen and Manzanillo, Cuba. Ports of call on this route were Antwerp; A Coruña; Vilagarcía de Arousa or Vigo; Havana; and Cienfuegos.

In 1909 NDL revised &quot;Coblenz&quot;″s passenger accommodation to 24 First Class; 32 Second Class; and 68 Third Class, and transferred her to its route between Sydney and Kobe. On her first voyage on the route, she left Hong Kong on 13 August, and reached Sydney on 5 September. Ports of call on this route were Brisbane; Rabaul; Friedrich-Wilhelms-Hafen; Maron (Hermit Islands, alternate voyages); Yap; Angaur (alternate voyages); Manila; and Hong Kong. On this route she proved more satisfactory than NDL&#x27;s &quot;Prinz Waldemar&quot; and &quot;Prinz Sigismund&quot;, so the German Government made her a Reichspostdampfer (&quot;State Post Steamer&quot;).

On 25 July 1914 &quot;Coblenz&quot; left Sydney for Kobe as normal, and called at Brisbane two days later. She was in passage from Brisbane to Rabaul on the eve of the First World War, when the German Government ordered all German merchant ships to take refuge in the nearest German or neutral port. &quot;Coblenz&quot; increased speed, reached Rabaul, and there disembarked all her passengers. From there she made for Manila, as the United States and its colonies were neutral.

==Seizure by the US==
By 1917 &quot;Coblenz&quot; was one of 17 German merchant ships in Manila. On 3 February that year the US Government detained German ships in all ports of the US and its colonies.

On 6 April 1917 the USA declared war on Germany, and the US Government seized all the German ships that had been detained since February. The United States Shipping Board (USSB) assumed ownership of &quot;Coblenz&quot;. In September 1917 it was reported that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had chartered three of the German ships seized in Manila: NDL&#x27;s &quot;Coblenz&quot;, &quot;Princess Alice&quot;; and &quot;Tübingen&quot;.

By 1918 the USSB had renamed the ship &quot;Sachem&quot;, and her official number was 215771. By 1919 she was registered in San Francisco, her code letters were NFKJ, and she was equipped with wireless telegraphy.

==Pacific Mail service and loss==
On 6 February 1920, Pacific Mail bought &quot;Sachem&quot; from the USSB for $400,000. She was renamed &quot;Cuba&quot;, and her code letters were changed to LHTM. Pacific Mail put her on its route between San Francisco and Havana via the Panama Canal. Later it shortened &quot;Cuba&quot;″s route to San Francisco – Cristóbal.

In September 1923 &quot;Cuba&quot; had been navigating through a dense fog for several days. At 04:30 hrs on the morning of 8 September she struck a reef at position , just off San Miguel Island in the Santa Barbara Channel off Point Arguello of Santa Barbara County, California. Her wireless was not working, and her No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 holds were flooded. The Chief Officer and eight crewmen set out in one of her lifeboats to seek help. Another 68 of &quot;Cuba&quot;″&#x27;s passengers and crew then set out in two more lifeboats. Her Master, Purser, and eight seamen remained aboard to guard her cargo, which included $2.5 million in silver bullion.
Despite the fog, a squadron of United States Navy destroyers was in the area undertaking a speed trial. One of the destroyers, , changed course because of the fog. At about 15:00 hrs, &quot;Reno&quot; passed of &quot;Cuba&quot;″s lifeboats at speed. After &quot;Reno&quot; passed a second lifeboat, and turned back. She rescued all the occupants of the two boats, who included women and children passengers. The survivors then directed &quot;Reno&quot; to &quot;Cuba&quot;″s wreck.

At first, the Chief Officer and eight men who had left &quot;Cuba&quot; in the first boat were not accounted for. However, a Standard Oil of California tanker, &quot;W. S. Miller&quot;, happened to find them, and landed them at Los Angeles.

The remainder of &quot;Reno&quot;″s squadron continued with the speed trial. It led to the Honda Point disaster later that day, in which seven of the destroyers were wrecked.

&quot;Cuba&quot;″s wreck forms an artificial reef, and supports marine life including the California sheephead. As such, it is now a wreck diving site.

<text>The catholic epistles (also called the general epistles) are seven epistles of the New Testament. Listed in order of their appearance in the New Testament, the catholic epistles are:
== Naming ==
The use of the word &quot;catholic&quot; in the term &quot;&#x27;catholic&quot; epistles&#x27; has been a convention going back to the fourth century. Untied to a particular denomination, it simply meant &quot;general&quot; at that time. Later, the word &quot;catholic&quot; would become part of the name of the Catholic Church. To avoid the assumption that these texts are therefore specific to the Catholic Church or Catholicism, alternative terms such as &quot;general epistles&quot; or &quot;general missionary epistles&quot; are used. 

In the historical context, the word &quot;catholic&quot; probably signified that the letters were addressed to the general church, and not to specific, separate congregations or persons, as with the Pauline epistles. However, 2 John and 3 John appear to contradict this view, because their addresses are respectively to the &quot;elect lady&quot;, speculated by many to be the church itself, and to &quot;Gaius&quot;, about whom there has been much speculation but little in the way of conclusive proof as to his identity. Some historians therefore think that the label &quot;catholic&quot; was originally applied to just 1 John, and expanded to all other non-Pauline epistles later on.

Some Protestants have termed these &quot;Lesser Epistles&quot;.

== Authorship ==
Three of the seven letters are anonymous. These three have traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee and one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Consequently, these letters have been labelled the Johannine epistles, despite the fact that none of the epistles mentions any author. Most modern scholars believe the author is not John the Apostle, but there is no scholarly consensus for any particular historical figure. (See Authorship of the Johannine works.)

Two of the letters claim to have been written by Simon Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. Therefore, they have traditionally been called the Petrine epistles. However, most modern scholars agree the second epistle was probably not written by Peter, because it appears to have been written in the early 2nd century, long after Peter had died. Yet, opinions on the first epistle are more divided; many scholars do think this letter is authentic, although it is written in a polished Greek even better than that of Paul, which is unlikely for an illiterate Jewish fisherman, and adopts Paul&#x27;s theology, which fits poorly with the tension between Paul and Peter.

In one epistle, the author only calls himself James (Ἰάκωβος &quot;Iákobos&quot;). It is not known which James this is supposed to be. There are several different traditional Christian interpretations of other New Testament texts which mention a James, brother of Jesus. However, most modern scholars tend to reject this line of reasoning, since the author himself does not indicate any familial relationship with Jesus. A similar problem presents itself with the Epistle of Jude (Ἰούδας &quot;Ioudas&quot;): the writer names himself a brother of James (ἀδελφὸς δὲ Ἰακώβου &quot;adelphos de Iakóbou&quot;), but it is not clear which James is meant. According to some Christian traditions, this is the same James as the author of the Epistle of James, himself reputedly a brother of Jesus; and so, this Jude should also be a brother of Jesus, despite the fact he does not indicate any such thing in his text.

With the exception of the Petrine epistles, both of which may be pseudepigrapha, the seven catholic epistles were added to the New Testament canon because early church fathers attributed the anonymous epistles to important people, and attributed the epistles written by people with the same name as important people to those important people.

== Rejection from the biblical canon ==
Acceptance of the Catholic epistles was contentious for the first few centuries of Christianity. Rejection among some Christians was first described by Origen in the early third century. Even after the epistles began to widely appear in canonical lists from the late fourth century, some groups continued to reject some or all the catholic epistles into the sixth and seventh centuries.

<doc id="715149" wikidata="Q1042863" url="?curid=715149" title="Carlos di Sarli">
<text>Carlos Di Sarli (January 7, 1903January 12, 1960) was an Argentine tango musician, orchestra leader, composer and pianist.

== Early years ==
Carlos di Sarli was born at 511 Buenos Aires street (now Yrigoyen) in the city of Bahía Blanca, located in Southern Argentina. He was the eighth child of the Italian immigrant Miguel Di Sarli, the owner of a gunsmith store, and Serafina Russomano, daughter of the tenor singer Tito Russomano. Baptized as Cayetano di Sarli in accordance with the solid Catholic tradition of his parents, he later changed his name to Carlos. Music played an important role in the family: Carlos&#x27; older brother Domingo was a teacher at the Williams music conservatory in Bahía Blanca, Nicolas, another older child, became a famous baritone, and Carlos&#x27; younger brother, Roque, turned into a pianist. Carlos received training in classical music in the conservatory where his brother was teaching.

In 1916, working in his father&#x27;s store, he suffered an accident that cost him an eye and which forced him to wear glasses for the rest of his life. Once recovered from the accident, 13-year-old Carlos joined a company of traveling musicians, touring various provinces and playing popular music including tangos. Then he moved to Santa Rosa in the La Pampa province where a friend of his father, another Italian immigrant by the name of Mario Manara, owned a cinema and a club. He played piano there for two years, accompanying silent movies and performing early tango songs at the club. In 1919, he returned to Bahía Blanca and set up his first orchestra, playing at the Cafe Express on the corner of Zelarrayan and Buenos Aires streets, and in Cafe Moka, on O&#x27;Higgins street. The orchestra also did tours in the provinces La Pampa, Córdoba, Mendoza, San Juan and Salta. In 1923, Carlos and his younger brother Roque moved to Buenos Aires.

== Active years as a musician ==

There, with the help of Alberico Spatola, the composer of the tango &quot;El trece&quot; and the director of the Buenos Aires police orchestra, he was able to join the band of Anselmo Aieta. In early 1924, Carlos joined an orchestra directed by the violin player Juan Pedro Castillo, and later, the trio of Alejandro Scarpino (the composer of &quot;Canaro en Paris&quot;). He accompanied the actress and singer Olinda Bozán on her recordings for the Electra label and worked as part of a sextet in the cabaret &quot;Chantecler&quot;.

Thanks to a recommendation from José Pécora, a violin player, he joined Osvaldo Fresedo&#x27;s orchestra in 1926 and played at the opening night of the &quot;Fénix&quot; theater in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Flores. Fresedo became an important influence on di Sarli&#x27;s music as well as a good friend. The tango &quot;Viejo milonguero&quot;, which di Sarli composed around 1927-28, was dedicated to Fresedo. It was around the same time that Juan &quot;Pacho&quot; Maglio and José María Rizzutti recorded the tango &quot;Meditación&quot; which di Sarli had composed around 1919 but never recorded himself.

In late 1927 he started to set up his own sextet or &quot;orchestra tipica&quot; (José Pécora and David Abramsky on violin, César Ginzo and Tito Landó on bandoneón and Adolfo Kraus on bass), directing it from behind the piano that he himself played. With the orchestra, di Sarli played live in clubs as well as radio shows in Radio Cultura and recorded for the label RCA Victor. In addition to instrumentals, he recorded with the vocalists Santiago Devincenzi (who later changed his last name to Devin), Ernesto Famá and Fernando Díaz. These singers were hired only to sing the short verses (&quot;estribillos&quot;) during the performances and were not constant members of his orchestra, unlike the musicians. Between November 26, 1928 and August 14, 1931, he recorded 48 tracks including the tangos &quot;T.B.C.&quot; by Edgardo Donato, &quot;Maldita&quot; by Antonio Rodio and Celedonio Flores, and the Eduardo Arolas compositions &quot;La guitarrita&quot; and &quot;Una noche de garufa&quot;.

In 1930, during a performance in the café &quot;El Germinal&quot;, di Sarli had an argument with one of the café&#x27;s owners who did not understand that he wore dark glasses on stage for medical reasons because of his accident at age 13. Di Sarli promptly moved with his orchestra to Bahía Blanca, where he performed at the &quot;La Central&quot; club. In 1932, Antonio Rodríguez Lesende joined the orchestra as a singer. In 1934, for unclear reasons, di Sarli left the orchestra and moved to Rosario in Santa Fe province where he joined a small band with the bandoneón player Juan Cambareri, the violin player Alberto Saikievich and the singer Roberto Pieri. His sextet continued to play without him, later changing its name to &quot;Orquesta Novel&quot; due to their performances at the club &quot;Novelty&quot;. At the request of the orchestra&#x27;s members in 1935, di Sarli rejoined the band temporarily to replace the pianist Ricardo Canataro who was ill at the time.

In late 1938, di Sarli reorganized his orchestra and in January 1939 debuted in Radio El Mundo. His orchestra consisted of Roberto Guisado, Ángel Goicoechea and Adolfo Pérez on violin, Roberto Gianitelli, Domingo Sánchez and Roberto Mititieri on bandoneón and Domingo Capurro on bass. The singer was Ignacio Murillo, soon to be replaced by Roberto Rufino who was 16 years old at the time. On December 11, 1939, they recorded for RCA Victor the tangos &quot;Corazón&quot; (composed by di Sarli, with Hector Marco&#x27;s lyrics) and &quot;Retirao&quot; by Carlos Posadas. He stayed with this recording label until 1949, when he withdrew from tango for commercial reasons.

In November 1951, he returned to the label Music Hall until April 1953 recording 84 tracks with the vocals of Mario Pomar and Oscar Serpa. From June 1954 until 1958 he returned to the RCA Victor label, leaving that year for Philips to record his last 14 tracks with Horacio Casares and Jorge Durán.

== Last orchestra lineup ==

Since 1958, in addition to Di Sarli on the piano, the orchestra included the violinists Roberto Guisado, Elvino Vardaro, A. Rouco, Szymsia Bajour, Carlos Arnaiz, Juan Schiaffino, C. González and A. Rossi; the bandoneón players F. Verdi, José Libertella, Julián Plaza, A. Marcucci y D. Sánchez; A. Sciarretta on bass and the singers Horacio Casares and Jorge Durán. Di Sarli, already seriously ill, gave his last performance on March 8, 1959, in the club &quot;Podestá de Lanús&quot;, finishing with a performance of &quot;Bahía Blanca&quot;, his own composition dedicated to his hometown.

== His vocalists ==

During the sextet years, his singers (in chronological order) were Santiago Devin (cenzi), Ernesto Famá, Fernando Díaz, Antonio Rodríguez Lesende, Roberto Arrieta and Ignacio Murillo. In his later years, larger orchestra Murillo was followed by Roberto Rufino, then Antonio Rodríguez Lesende, Agustín Volpe, Carlos Acuña, Alberto Podestá, again Roberto Rufino, then again Alberto Podestá, Osvaldo Cabrera, Roberto Rufino for a third time, Alberto Podestá for a third time, Jorge Durán, Raúl Rosales, Alberto Podestá for the fourth time, Osvaldo Cordó, Oscar Serpa, Mario Pomar, again Oscar Serpa, Argentino Ledesma, Rodolfo Galé, Roberto Florio, and finally Jorge Durán again and Horacio Casares.

== Di Sarli&#x27;s musical style ==

In the beginning, his music had a simple structure, but over time it matured into a more lyrical, richer, playful and more subtle style which remained popular with tango dancers as it continued to have a clear dancing beat. This clean &quot;compás&quot; made him a favorite of beginning social tango dancers, while more advanced ones could enjoy the complexity and variations of his music. Because of this, di Sarli&#x27;s orchestra was among the most popular ones during Carnival balls of his age and can still be heard at milongas in Buenos Aires and around the world today.

Di Sarli moved beyond the style of the &quot;guardia vieja&quot; of tango and Julio de Caro&#x27;s avant-garde, preferring to forge his own style without concession to the fashions of the day. While being influenced by Fresedo early on, he soon established his own way. A talented piano player, he directed his orchestra from behind his own instrument. His recordings do not feature significant instrumental solos; the bandoneóns at times carry the melody but essentially play a rhythmical, milonguero role. Only the violins stand out, playing a short solo or a counterpoint melody. He recorded many tracks more than once over the years, often with different singers. Di Sarli&#x27;s creativity was mostly limited to the left hand piano part, filling in, modulating and accenting his delicate and elegant dancing beat. His reputation for musical elegance got him his nickname &quot;El Señor del Tango&quot; (&quot;The Gentleman of Tango&quot;).

<text>The Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg (also referred to as the University of Würzburg, in German &quot;Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg&quot;) is a public research university in Würzburg, Germany. Founded in 1402, it is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Germany. The university initially had a brief run and was closed in 1415. It was reopened in 1582 on the initiative of Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn. Today, the university is named for Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn and Maximilian Joseph.

The University of Würzburg is part of the U15 group of research-intensive German universities. The university is also a member of the Coimbra Group. In the winter semester 2022/2023, 26,787 students were enrolled, of which 16,351 were women and 3,250 were first semester university students. The University is associated with 14 Nobel laureates.

==Name==
Its official name is Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg (or &quot;Julius-Maximilian University of Würzburg&quot;) but it is commonly referred to as the University of Würzburg. This name is taken from Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, who reestablished the university in 1582, and Prince Elector Maximilian Joseph, the prince under whom secularization occurred at the start of the 19th century. The university&#x27;s central administration, foreign student office, and several research institutes are located within the area of the old town, while the new liberal arts campus, with its modern library, overlooks the city from the east. The university today enrolls approximately 29,000 students, out of which more than 1,000 come from other countries.

==History==

===First founding in 1402===

The university was founded as the &quot;High School of Würzburg&quot; on an initiative started in 1401 by Prince Bishop Johann von Egloffstein. He wanted to transform the &quot;Gymnasium herbipolense&quot; into a university with four faculties hoping that an influx of teaching staff and students in his territory would cover the need for qualified lawyers and clerics and thus lead to an upturn in the city&#x27;s economy. He bought the buildings needed for teaching from members of his cathedral chapter.

On 10 December 1402, he was granted the required privilege from Pope Boniface IX. This put Würzburg among the cities with the oldest universities in the then German-speaking area – Prague (1348), Vienna (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388) and Erfurt (1392), and made Würzburg the oldest university in Bavaria. Among the teachers at the university were Winand von Steeg, Johannes Ambundi and Bartholomäus Fröwein.

Already before 1430, however, teaching was suspended shortly after the death of Prince Bishop von Egloffstein. The reason for the decline was primarily the lack of funding, since it had not been possible to establish a foundation that had its own benefice. On 30 November 1413, the rector of the university, Johann Zantfurt, was murdered by his valet; the circumstances were never clarified. Later, Lorenz Fries bought the university building. In 1427, the &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; was mentioned for the last time in a document. By that time, it had not been dissolved yet, but had become insignificant. Friedrich von Wirsberg, who became prince-bishop in 1558, was the first to consider rebuilding the university. Due to problems with the clergy and administration, however, he was unable to realize his plans

=== From re-founding in 1582 to 1945 ===
After classes had been resumed in some of the subjects in 1551 and the first doctorates had already been awarded in 1567, the Würzburg Prince-Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, during the Counter-Reformation, in 1575, first obtained the imperial and then, in 1576, the papal privileges to re-establish the university (see also Erasmus Neustetter called Stürmer). This time, financing was better ensured, and student regulations were stricter. On 2 January 1582, first the theological and philosophical faculties were reopened, and their deans appointed. The name of the university was &quot;Academia Iulia&quot; (Julius University). The university seal was not created until the following year, and thus bears the year 1583. Statutes for the medical faculty were drawn up in 1587. Although the number of lecturers was not complete until 1593, the first medical student, Georg Leyerer from Ebersbrunn, was already enrolled on 2 October 1585.

In 1591, the four-winged university building and the associated church (Neubaukirche) in one of its angles, both commissioned by Julius Echter, were completed. It seems certain that the architect of the building was Georg Robin. Theologians, lawyers and humanities scholars were accommodated in this complex which today is called &quot;Alte Universität&quot;. The medical faculty found its home in Juliusspital.

Initially, the university was only open to Catholic students. In 1734, Prince Bishop Friedrich Karl von Schönborn issued new study regulations which opened it up to non-Catholics, too. First, theology in Würzburg was determined by Jesuits. But in 1773, the Würzburg Jesuit College was dissolved, and Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim hired followers of the Enlightenment for the theological faculty and thus laid the foundation for its future orientation. From then on, and especially under his successor Franz Ludwig von Erthal, Enlightenment theologians became increasingly active in Würzburg. Nevertheless, it was only in the early 19th century, after Würzburg had come under Bavarian rule, that the university gave up its ecclesiastical-Catholic character.

The modern development of medical subjects began in the 18th century with the establishment of the medical clinic – in 1767, the &quot;internist&quot; and chemist Franz Heinrich Meinolf Wilhelm became the first head of the Juliusspital hospital. The surgical university clinic was established in 1769 under Carl Caspar von Siebold. In 1796, the physician and court medicus Anton Müller (1755–1827) began working at Juliusspital in Würzburg; although he never belonged to the university, he became the first psychiatrist in the hospital and the first to publish on his specialty. Franz Heinrich Meinolf Wilhelm, who as a professor held lectures in German for the first time from 1785, was the first to practice experimental chemistry at the University of Würzburg.

==== 19th century onwards ====
Around 1800, the first student associations were founded in Würzburg. The Scientific dentistry in Würzburg began with the appointment of Carl Joseph Ringelmann as professor in 1807. In 1822, a faculty of political science was established at the university.

During the coalition wars, the university was renamed several times: First &quot;Churfürstliche Julius-Universität&quot; (1803), &quot;Julius Maximilians Universität&quot; (1803/04–1805/06), then &quot;Kurfürstliche Universität zu Würzburg&quot; (1806–1806/07), &quot;Großherzogliche Universität zu Würzburg&quot; (1807–1814), and finally &quot;Königliche Universität zu Würzburg&quot; (1815–1838). The names reflected the different affiliations of the university to the Electorate of Bavaria, which perished in 1806, to the Grand Duchy of Würzburg, which existed as a Rhineland state until 1814, and then to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

In the winter semester of 1838/39, the &quot;Königliche Universität zu Würzburg&quot; was renamed &quot;Königliche Julius-Maximilians-Universität&quot; and two years later &quot;Königlich Bayerische Julius-Maximilians-Universität&quot; which was to be its name for almost 80 years.

After 1850, the university experienced a strong upswing. Numerous new buildings were created: for medicine in the vicinity of Juliusspital and Pleicherwall, for the natural sciences on today&#x27;s Röntgenring and on Koellikerstraße, for dentistry at Pleichertor (demolished in 1879), and for the mental hospital on Schalksberg. Basic medical subjects were taught and researched in the &quot;Kollegienhaus&quot;, which was completed in 1853 and was the first modern &quot;biocentre&quot; in Germany. The first full professor of ophthalmology, appointed in 1866 by the Bavarian king, was Robert Ritter von Welz, a student of Albrecht von Graefe.

In 1857, the doctor, who had been teaching ophthalmology and dentistry in Würzburg since 1850, opened a private eye clinic in the former birthing house of Adam Elias von Siebold on Klinikstraße 6. On 4 January 1858, he acquired the building, which was donated by the Welzsche Marienstiftung for Poor People with Eye Diseases according to Welz&#x27; will in 1878 and became the first Würzburg university eye clinic. The former delivery house, which had been founded in 1805 as the first maternity clinic in Würzburg and a training center for midwives and obstetricians, in 1857, under Friedrich Wilhelm Scanzoni von Lichtenfels, moved to a new building on Klinikstraße 8. As an assistant to the surgeon Cajetan von Textor, Robert von Welz was also one of the pioneers of ether anesthesia in the German-speaking world. He developed an inhaler and, after testing it on himself and others in the winter of 1846/47, published the first work on it, and thus established modern anesthesiology in Würzburg.

In the winter semester of 1876/77, the number of students at the University of Würzburg exceeded 1,000 for the first time. In 1888, the university, whose medical faculty was one of the most important after Vienna and Prague between 1850 and 1880, received its own pharmaceutical institute.

On 28 October 1896, a new main building, called &quot;Neue Universität&quot;, was inaugurated on Sanderring (its construction began in 1892); it is still the seat of the university management today.

On 3 June 1896, Marcella O&#x27;Grady Boveri was the first woman to be admitted to the Würzburg Medical Faculty. The first woman to habilitate at the University of Würzburg was the psychologist Maria Schorn in 1929.

A new eye clinic was opened on Röntgenring 12 in 1901, with the portrait of Welz engraved over the portal. Welzhaus on Klinikstraße 6 was affiliated to the women&#x27;s clinic on Klinikstraße 8, which existed there until 1934, and connected to it by a corridor on the first floor, which was destroyed in World War II and restored in 1974. Welzhaus which was also destroyed except for its outer façade on 16 March 1945, was rebuilt in 1953/1954. The Mathematical Institute was accommodated there until 1974, when the building was affiliated to the Medical Polyclinic.

Between 1901 and 1911, five Würzburg researchers, whose appointment was mainly due to the mathematician Friedrich Prym (dean and rector), were awarded Nobel Prizes. This strongly contributed to the international importance of the University of Würzburg, particularly of its philosophical faculty.

After the November Revolution of 1918/19, which ended monarchy in Bavaria, the university also lost its title &quot;Königlich Bayerisch&quot; and was given its current name: &quot;Julius-Maximilians-Universität&quot;.

The medical faculty separated from Juliusspital and in 1921 moved to the new University Hospital of Würzburg on the outskirts of the city. It was called &quot;Luitpold Krankenhaus&quot;. The State Luitpold Hospital was solemnly handed over on 2 November 1921, and within one year the various clinics moved into it. By the summer semester that year, the proportion of students enrolled in medicine had risen to 60 percent.

In 1934, under its director Carl Joseph Gauss, the university women&#x27;s clinic and the affiliated midwifery school moved from Welzhaus on Klinikstraße to the Grombühl district.

An Institute for Genetics and Race Research was set up in Welzhaus on Klinikstraße 6 in November 1938 and inaugurated in May 1939.

Between 1933 and 1945, the University of Würzburg deprived 184 scientists of their doctoral degrees. Above all, scientists of Jewish origin were thus degraded. After the critical processing of these events in 2010, the university posthumously rehabilitated these researchers in a public ceremony in May 2011.

=== Post War period ===
After the Second World War, the faculty of theology was the first to start anew on 1 October 1945. The faculty of medicine (dean: Jürg Zutt) followed; it was officially reopened with the constitutive faculty meeting on 11 January 1947, and began its lectures in the winter semester of 1946 /47. On 12 March 1947, the university was solemnly reopened.

According to a report by rector Josef Martin (philologist), the military government had dismissed 123 of the 150 professors who had worked before 1945 and only allowed 27 back to lecture at the university.

In 1955, Julius Büdel significantly developed Africa Research in Würzburg. It was mainly due to the results of Büdel&#x27;s and Horst Mensching&#x27;s research trips, that Würzburg had become an important center for geographical research on Africa by the late 1970s.

On 11 May 1965, the university laid the foundation stone for the new Hubland Campus on a hill in the east of Würzburg. The site had been acquired by the Free State of Bavaria from the city of Würzburg in 1962 already, to make room for the more than 6,000 students enrolled at Alma Julia. In the years that followed, numerous new buildings were put up there, among them the chemistry center (from 1965 to 1972 the rooms for organic chemistry, pharmacy and food chemistry, inorganic chemistry and a central building were set up), the philosophy building, the university library, the biocentre (1992), sports facilities, buildings for physics, mathematics and computer science, a computer centre, a new canteen and student residences. In 2011, the central lecture hall and seminar building for all faculties (Z6) was inaugurated on Hubland campus, as well as a new internship building for the natural sciences.

Starting from the existing Surgical Clinic (head: Ernst Kern), new subjects, departments and clinics developed in the seventies: in 1970, the Urological University Clinic (Hubert Frohmüller); in 1978, the Department for Special Thoracic Surgery (Associate Professor H. J. Viereck), the Department for Surgical X-ray Diagnostics (Extraordinarius G. Viehweger), and the Department for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology (Extraordinarius D. Wiebecke). Furthermore, on 16 June 1969, the first Bavarian chair for anesthesiology was established in the medical faculty, headed by his professor Karl-Heinz Weis (* 1927). Weis had already been in charge of the anesthesiology department since 1966 when Werner Wachsmuth was head of the surgical clinic. The former Chair for Genetic Science and Race Research, which Gebsattel had taken over, was renamed the Chair for Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy in 1965 and was filled by Dieter Wyss in 1968. In 1979, Holger Höhn was appointed to the Institute for Human Genetics, which had emerged from this chair. In 1978 the Institute for X-ray Diagnostics was established in the Medical Clinic under Extraordinarius H. Braun.

In 1973, over 10,000 students were enrolled at the University of Würzburg, and the former conservatory became a university of music. In 1981, the University Library of Würzburg moved into its new building on Hubland.

On 31 January 1983, a poisoned drink attack was carried out at the university. The drinks, which were mixed with thallium(I) sulfate, were put in front of a lecture hall together with a note declaring them as leftovers from a carnival party and donating them to the freshmen. The medical student Robert A. died as a result of the poisoning; eleven other students had to be treated in the hospital; the law student Peter S. sustained lasting damage. The perpetrator could never be identified.

On 12 April 2011, the university opened its new Campus North, right next to Hubland campus: An additional site of 39 hectares is now available for the future development of the university. Campus North used to be a US military base (Leighton Barracks). After the Americans withdrew in January 2009, the university had the opportunity to use part of the former barracks for itself. This conversion from military to civilian area made rapid progress, and the campus canteen was inaugurated in 2014.

== Criticism ==
The university management practices name sponsorship for its lecture halls; there is a Sparkassen Lecture Hall, a Brose Lecture Hall and an AOK Lecture Hall. The student representatives criticized that the university ran the risk of becoming dependent on its sponsors because the State was reluctant to renovate lecture halls.

== Miscellaneous ==
The tower of Neubaukirche (university auditorium), with its height of 91 meters the city&#x27;s tallest church tower, has one of the four carillons in Bavaria. Between Easter and Christmas, public concerts of about 30 minutes are given on it every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m.

In March 2016, JMU was the first university in Bavaria to be awarded the &quot;Bavaria barrier-free&quot; signet. The award was given for the removal of structural barriers, especially in new buildings, and for the establishment of the Information Center for People with Disabilities and Chronic Diseases (KIS), created in 2008.

On 7 January 2019, the online portal WueStudy of the University of Würzburg was launched after a lengthy planning and processing phase. It replaces the former sb@home portal and uses the HISinOne software developed by the Hochschul-Informations-System.

== The University and the city ==
Today, around 28,000 students are enrolled at the university. In addition, there are more than 8,600 students at the University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt, founded on 1 August 1971, and around 750 students at the University of Music. Thus, every fourth citizen of Würzburg is a student.

With a total of more than 10,000 employees, the university and its hospital are among the largest employers in the region.

<doc id="715156" wikidata="Q380673" url="?curid=715156" title="Osvaldo Pugliese">
<text>Osvaldo Pedro Pugliese (December 2, 1905 – July 25, 1995) was an Argentine tango musician. He developed dramatic arrangements that retained strong elements of the walking beat of salon tango but also heralded the development of concert-style tango music. Some of his music, mostly since the 1950s, is used for theatrical dance performances. In Buenos Aires, Pugliese is often played later in the evening when the dancers want to dance more slowly, impressionistically and intimately.

== Personal life ==

His father, Don Adolfo Pugliese (1877–1945), pushed him to work harder; his mother, Aurelia Terragno (1880–1947), often whispered to her son while he was practicing, &quot;¡Al Colón!&quot; (&quot;To the Colón!&quot;), referring to Buenos Aires&#x27; famous Teatro Colón, where only the country&#x27;s finest artists play. His other brothers &quot;Adolfo Vicente&quot; and &quot;Alberto Roque&quot; were violinists. He was married two times, to María Concepción Florio and to Lydia Elman. His first wife died in 1971, and he had one daughter, Lucela Delma &quot;Beba&quot; Pugliese (b. 1939), a pianist in her own right.

== Orquesta Osvaldo Pugliese ==

In 1918 he left primary school to work as a print graphic artist. His father finally convinced him to take classes with the teacher Antonio D&#x27;Agostino, at the Conservatorio Odeon.

He wrote his first tango, &quot;Recuerdo,&quot; in 1924, when he was 19. Two years later, when it was finally recorded, it became a classic. &#x27;La yumba&#x27; (1946) is another famous and most popular Pugliese&#x27;s tangos compositions.

In 1939 he formed his orchestra as a cooperative and made his debut at Café El Nacional (980 Corrientes Avenue – &quot;Cathedral of Tango&quot;) on 11 August 1939.

The orchestra toured the former Soviet Union in 1959 (eighty cities in three months – sometimes playing two or three shows a day) and also China (twenty-eight cities in another month), Chile (1990), Mexico, Columbia (1980), Peru, Cuba (1984, 1988, 1992), Japan (1965, 135 shows in five months; 1979, 1989), the U.S. (stopping in Chicago in 1979), the Middle East, France (1984), Portugal, Spain (1985; 1988 playing in Madrid, at Teatro Albéniz with the singer Joan Manuel Serrat, and Barcelona), Belgium, The Netherlands (with Astor Piazzolla in Amsterdam, 29 June 1989), Finland and almost all South and Central American countries: Uruguay (1987, Solís Theatre in Montevideo). For his work the maestro received high cultural distinctions, including from the Argentine, French and Cuban governments.

=== Teatro Colón concert (1985) ===

At age 80, he was allowed on 26 December 1985 to give a concert at the Teatro Colón, in Buenos Aires. He received 5 standing ovations. With characteristic humility he said: “The truth is... it’s a night of the people, of the masses, lovers of our genre, our beloved genre, tango.” The ceremony was led by Luis Brandoni and Héctor Larrea. The orchestra&#x27;s members that night were: Roberto Álvarez, Alejandro Previgniano, Fabio Lapinta (bandoneons), Osvaldo Montermi, Fernando Rodríguez, Diego Lerendegui, Gabriel Rivas (violins), Merei Brain (Viola), Amílcar Tolosa (double bass) and Osvaldo Pugliese (piano).

List of songs that were played:

== Tango compositions ==

The most famous tango composition of Osvaldo Pugliese are: Recuerdo (1924), Ausencia (Tango mío) (1931), El frenopático, Primera categoría, El encopao (1942), Recién (1943), Adiós Bardi (1944), Una vez (1946), Igual que una sombra (1946), La yumba, Negracha (1948), Malandraca (1949), Milonga para Fidel (1961), Para Eduardo Arolas.

The first recording of &quot;Recuerdo&quot; was by the Julio De Caro orchestra, on December 9, 1926, in instrumental form. In 1927 the female singer Rosita Montemar recorded it sung for the first time, with the accompaniment of musicians from the Víctor label. The Bianco-Bachicha orchestra recorded it instrumentally in Paris in 1928. And in 1930, the Orquesta Típica Victor, with the voice of Roberto Díaz. All labels feature A. Pugliese. And even more, it still appears like this on the RCA-Víctor 39776 album, from Ricardo Tanturi&#x27;s version of 1942.

The famous tango &quot;Recuerdo – a los amigos&quot; was composed by Puglise in the honor of his friends: Torcuato Di Giorgio, Amadeo Pioriello, Alfredo Bianchi, Jose Tonareeli &amp; Rogelio Boisselier.

Pugliese had composed the immortal Recuerdo in 1924 – “a tango for the year 3000”, according to Julio De Caro, who premiered it in 1927– and performed with Paquita Bernardo, Alfredo Gobbi (h) and Elvino Vardaro: he was not a stranger, but a popular musician who put together that initial orchestra as a cooperative.

== Political views ==

Pugliese was outspoken in his political opinions. His communist sympathies, though never violent, at times earned him the hostility of those in power.

“The exact reason why Osvaldo Pugliese was imprisoned the first time was never known, a fact that did not occur during the Perón government but before, in 1939, when he was preparing to debut with his orchestra at the inauguration of the new headquarters of the Communist Party”...&quot;They wanted to punish the rebellion by imprisoning a prestigious figure on the left.&quot; according to the writer Enrique Medina. It is known: at the police station he was treated with respect, invited to drink mate in the officer&#x27;s office and they went to look for “tortitas negras”, which he liked. After a few days, freedom, the expected debut now at the National Theater and the confession of the police that they had &quot;felt honored to be with such an artist.&quot;

The idea of the red carnation on the piano was born: if Pugliese was in prison, the orchestra played the same, without a pianist. It has been said that it was proposed by Negro Mella, then presenter and reciter and later replaced by Eduardo Moreno, the author of the lyrics of Recuerdo. However, other testimonies –Petit de Murat, García Jiménez, Jauretche- pierced that story: yes, the carnation was placed on the piano, but many times Don Osvaldo appeared later, gave the flower to some lady in the audience.

He was a member of the Communist Party starting in 1936. He also managed to help create &quot;Sociedad de Músicos y Artistas Afines&quot; to increase job stability and wages for musicians.

In 1956, he was imprisoned by the dictatorship of the Revolución Libertadora in the so-called &quot;Operation Cardenal&quot;, together with the entire Central Committee of the Communist Party. They were locked up in the ship &quot;París&quot;, which was to be sunk with them inside. That night, Pugliese&#x27;s orchestra had to appear on Radio Splendid, and they appeared without their conductor, and with a red carnation on the piano as a protest.
The imprisonment of Rodolfo Ghioldi and Oreste Castronuovo, among other anonymous militants, in a Pugliese&#x27;s ship, and the rumors that it was going to be sunk, generated so much commotion that they had to be released.

In 1961, he wrote &quot;Milonga Para Fidel&quot; to show his support for the Cuban revolution. When he was in jail, he still wrote arrangements and the orchestra still performed, and placed a red carnation on the keyboard of the piano in his honor.

The 1960s government of the late General Juan Carlos Onganía (who had a deep fear of Peronists and communists alike) simply banned Pugliese from radio broadcasts and public places.

Pugliese was a man of integrity and humility. He spent years in jail due to his beliefs. The government also restricted his recordings to 10 per year. As a communist, he organised his orchestra as a cooperative and paid his members by their contribution, earning their loyalty. Quite rare, his core orchestra members (Osvaldo Ruggiero 1st bandoneon, Enrique Camerano 1st violin, Julio Carrasco and Oscar Herrero 2nd violins, Alcides Rossi on double bass) stayed with him nearly 30 years (1939–1968).

In 1955 Pugliese was imprisoned in Devoto from January to July, and in that prison he was seen, with a mop and bucket, cleaning corridors, refusing to let other detainees take away that work.

Don Osvaldo was never an agitator, but a man with convictions who never confused art with ideology. It happened that in certain political stages of Argentina, due to his popularity, they considered him a &quot;war booty&quot;.

At the end of 1973, a few months before Peron died, the founder of Justicialismo organized an artistic show to which he invited figures such as Horacio Guarany, Mercedes Sosa, Edmundo Rivero and Osvaldo Pugliese. The next noon there was a lunch in Olivos, and there Perón got up, went to Pugliese and extended his hand:

&quot;I want to apologize, teacher, for those little matters that we had pending...&quot;

The musician accepted the greeting and replied:

&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. Everything is already forgotten.&quot;

Perón looked him in the eye raised his voice:

&quot;Only greats like you know how to forgive.&quot;

== Death ==

He died after a short illness on 25 July 1995 at 89 years old. His remains are in Chacarita Cemetery in an imposing mausoleum, the work of Juan Carlos Ferraro (1997), which was made thanks to the generous contribution of his fans. His funeral received great attention with an impressive caravan that marched in reverse along Corrientes Avenue.

== &quot;San Pugliese&quot; ==

It is said that during a Charly García recital a series of situations and technical problems were triggered that delayed the start of the show. The sound was not working well, until someone from the team tried to do a test with a record of Maestro Pugliese. Everything began to improve and Charly gave the show. Hence the myth of good luck that the invocation of the musician brought.

In 2000, five years after Pugliese&#x27;s death, the musician Alberto Muñoz wrote a prayer to pray to the tango patron saint.

Other artists, including León Gieco and Javier Calamaro, acknowledged that they invoked the musician born on December 2, 1905, to ward off any inconvenience. &quot;We always mention Pugliese&quot;, Gieco sings in &quot;Los Salieris de Charly&quot;, a song dated 1992. Sebastián Bianchini, from the Tree group, composed an ironic song dedicated to Pugliese (&quot;Suerte&quot;)

&quot;It seems that mixing his musical activity with the political would mean making it dirty, but he never loses sight of this ethical-aesthetic relationship that he has known how to project and shape in his interlocutors&quot;, said María Mercedes Liska

In the image of &quot;Saint Pugliese&quot; the artist and the man committed to society are synthesized, without his name being at the mercy of the negative connotations of politics.

== Filmography ==

He participated as an actor in the films:

* &quot;Mis cinco hijos&quot; (1946).
* &quot;Tango y tango&quot; (1984).
* &quot;Coexistencia&quot; (1993).
* &quot;Muchas gracias maestro&quot; (1993), unfinished documentary.

== Awards ==

* In 1986, during the tenure of Mayor Julio César Saguier, the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires declared him &quot;Ciudadano Ilustre&quot;.
* In 1988 he was awarded with the title of Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Ministry of Culture of France.
* In 1992, on 11 November he was awarded with the Alejo Carpentier medal, the most important cultural distinction by the Council of State of Cuba.

<text>The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (, abbreviated AUTh), often called the University of Thessaloniki, is the second oldest tertiary education institution in Greece. Named after the philosopher Aristotle, who was born in Stageira, about east of Thessaloniki, it is the largest university in Greece and its campus covers in the centre of Thessaloniki, with additional educational and administrative facilities elsewhere.

As of 2023, it has approximately 88,283 active students enrolled at the university (77,198 at the undergraduate level and 6,588 in postgraduate programmes of which 3,952 at doctoral level) and 2,366 faculty members. There are additionally 248 members of the Laboratory Teaching Staff and 213 members of the Special Technical Laboratory Staff. The administrative staff consists of 400 permanent employees and 528 subcontractor employees that are contracted by the university.

The language of instruction is Greek, although there are programs in foreign languages and courses for international students, which are carried out in English, French, German and Italian.

== History ==

The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was founded in 1925 during the premiership of Alexandros Papanastassiou and was legislated under Law 3341/14-6-25. It was the second Greek university to be founded after the University of Athens, which was established in 1837. The university was built on top of the remains of what had once been the Jewish cemetery in Thessaloniki, until the cemetery&#x27;s destruction during the Nazi occupation. Gravestones from the Jewish cemetery were used as building materials in the construction of the university.

According to Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27; plans following the end of the World War I, Smyrna was intended to be the seat of the second Greek university, while the third university was to be established in Thessaloniki. However, Smyrna was not part of Greece at the time and the plans fell through after the outcome of the Greco-Turkish War in Asia Minor. Nevertheless, in 1924, Alexandros Papanastassiou decided to found a university in Thessaloniki in order to boost the local economy and culture.

The chronological development of the university, which was renamed the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1954, can be divided into three stages, each covering a period of approximately 25 years.

=== First stage (1926–1950) ===
During the first stage of its operation (1926–1950), the development focused on those schools which were generally accepted as constituting one educational institute, namely the Faculty of Philosophy, the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Law and Economics, the School of Theology and the Medical School. The first stage of development ended with the foundation of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1950, which was the only faculty of veterinary medicine in Greece for many years. After this period, some of the aforementioned faculties were extended by integrating more departments. In more detail, the Departments of Pharmacy and Dentistry were founded in 1955 and 1959 respectively and they were incorporated into the Medical School. Moreover, the Faculty of Philosophy was expanded by integrating the Institutes of Foreign Languages (English, French, German and Italian).

=== Second stage (1951–1975) ===
During the second stage (1951–1975) the focal point of development was the Faculty of Engineering, also known as the Polytechnic Faculty. At the beginning, this faculty constituted an independent institute also called the Polytechnic or Technical University. Therefore, for the first fifty years of its operation the Aristotle University consisted of two distinct institutes which operated independently. Subsequently, these two educational institutes were unified. The various schools within the Faculty of Engineering were founded in the following order: School of Civil Engineering (1955–56), School of Architecture (1956–57), School of Rural and Surveying Engineering (1962–63), School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (1972–73), School of Chemical Engineering (1972–73), School of Mathematics, Physics and Computational Sciences (1982–83) and School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering (2004). The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was split in two independent schools (School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 1976.

=== Third stage (1975–present) ===
Finally, during the third stage of its development (1975-today), new schools and departments were founded along with the aforementioned engineering schools. Moreover, the university acquired a small number of departments which operated in the past as independent institutes of higher education. During this period, the Faculty of Fine Arts was established, along with all its constituent schools (Drama, Film Studies, Music Studies, Visual and Applied Arts). Additionally, the School of Journalism and Mass Media Studies and the School of Physical Education and Sports Sciences were created as independent schools. Overall, the third stage of development of the Aristotle University is characterized not only by the establishment of new faculties, schools and departments, but also by many major changes in the structure of the university itself. These changes include the downgrade of some former faculties into schools or departments and the upgrade of others.

Today, the Aristotle University comprises 12 faculties, 36 schools, and numerous other units (e.g. laboratories, study rooms, libraries, clinics and research centres), which make it the largest university in Greece and southeastern Europe in terms of number of staff, undergraduate and postgraduate students and the facilities offered. According to the significant Jewish past and present of Thessaloniki the Aristotle University planned together with the Jewish community of Thessaloniki in 2014, the reopening of the Faculty of Jewish Studies. A former Jewish faculty was abolished 80 years before by the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas. This new faculty took in October 2015, her work on with leading professor Georgios Antoniou. 

On the university campus a monument commemorating the old Jewish cemetery was unveiled in 2014. The monument consists of grave stones in a bed of grass alongside a broken Jewish menorah. The campus was built partially on this old cemetery. The memorial has been vandalized several times.

== Emblem ==
The emblem of the Aristotle University is Demetrius of Thessaloniki.

== Departments and faculties ==

The university consists of eleven faculties, consisting of 41 schools.

History and affiliations of schools
* The School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering is located in Veria.
* Part of the School of Physical Education and Sports Sciences is located in Serres.
* The School of Medicine is strongly associated with the AHEPA University Hospital. 
* Philosophy is typically taught in conjunction with Pedagogy on Greek Universities, unlike foreign counterparts.

== Research ==
The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki performs a great deal of research in a variety of scientific fields. It is in constant and close cooperation with universities, organizations and research centres both in Greece and abroad. The large number of its faculties and its approximately 250 laboratories enable scientists of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki to carry out a variety of research projects with great success.

== Rankings and academic evaluation==
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki is among the most prestigious universities in Greece.

An external evaluation of all academic departments in Greek universities was conducted by the Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (HQA), giving it the &quot;Worthy of merit&quot; final overall evaluation.

Despite the university&#x27;s good reputation within Greece, internationally the university currently performs averagely on major international rankings. Once best university in Greece, it is currently ranked 650-700th in the latest (2023) QS rankings, further progressing to the 530th place for the year 2024, and 801-1000th in Times Higher Education.

Finally, CWTS Leiden ranking places AUTh as the 299th best university in the world for the year 2023. 

== Organization and administration ==
The Aristotle University is one of Greece&#x27;s public universities and therefore it is a legal entity with full self governance. It is primarily state-funded and functions under the supervision of the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs. Other financial resources for the university are donations from individuals, participation in various EU research programmes and profits generated through management of the university assets. It is important to note that no fees are charged to the students of the university, except for international students studying medicine in English. With tuition fees reaching up to €6000 per semester.

The university administration consists of departments that make decisions within the framework of Greek law. The main objectives of the administration are to ensure the proper function of the university and to benefit the academic community as a whole.

=== Hierarchy ===
Every Greek public university comprises the faculties and the faculties comprise the schools. A school covers a basic scientific area and thus is considered to be the basic academic unit. Every school is subdivided into departments, which are responsible for the teaching of a specific part of the school&#x27;s scientific area. Moreover, schools have substantial autonomy in educational matters and therefore they are mainly responsible for planning and implementing educational programs and granting degrees.

=== Administrative authorities ===

==== University Senate ====

The highest administrative authority is the University Senate. It consists of the following members (senators):
* The rector and the three vice-rectors.
* The deans of the various faculties.
* The chairmen of the various schools.
* Representatives of the associate professors, assistant professors and lecturers.
* Representatives of the special laboratory teaching staff and the administrative staff.
* Representatives of the undergraduate and postgraduate students of every faculty.

==== Rector&#x27;s Council ====
The second highest administrative authority is the Rector&#x27;s Council, which comprises the rector, the three vice-rectors, one student representative and one representative of the administration staff. Each member of the Rector&#x27;s Council is elected every five years.

==== Rector ====
The rector is the president of the University Senate and the main representative of the university in various national and international bodies. Moreover, he or she is responsible for developing an overall strategy for the development of the university and for implementing the decisions taken by the Senate and the Rector&#x27;s Council. Both the rector and the three vice-rectors are elected every three years in university-wide elections where all faculty, staff and student representatives vote. Each vice-rector has different administrative responsibilities, among which are: staff management, financial planning and development, academic affairs.

==== Faculty, school and department administrative bodies ====
Every faculty, school and department has its own administrative body, the members of which are democratically elected on the basis of collective processes. In more detail, decisions on academic, financial and administrative matters within a single department are made by the department&#x27;s general assembly, which consists of faculty members and student representatives. The decision-making process often involves the creation of ad hoc committees.

== Staff ==
The university staff is divided into five main categories:
* Teaching research staff: The staff in this category undertakes the majority of the teaching and research work done in the university. It comprises professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. Lecturers (rank abolished) also belong in this category. These four levels were established under law 1268/1982 and to advance to a higher level, one must show significant teaching and research work.
* Laboratory teaching staff: The members of this category are administering the university laboratories and they undertake special applied and laboratory teaching work. Holders of a doctoral degree who are members of this rank can independently teach courses and supervise undergraduate and post-graduate theses, in the same way as the Teaching research staff members do.
* Special teaching staff: Members of this category carry out special educational-teaching work, e.g., teaching foreign languages or Greek as a foreign language, physical education, design as well as other fine and applied arts.
* Special technical laboratory staff: They are responsible for keeping the laboratory equipment in good condition. They also provide specific technical laboratory services and help with the teaching laboratory.
* Administrative staff: This category comprises all employees working in administrative positions.

The educational work is also exercised by people who do not belong to the university staff, such as guest professors and generally scientists who are invited to teach specific courses.

== University units ==
The campus of the Aristotle University covers 230,000 square metres and is located near the centre of the city of Thessaloniki. The majority of the university units is found inside the campus, but there are also various institutions, laboratories, and facilities of the university which are located outside the campus such as the Centre of Byzantine Researches, veterinary clinics, the university farm, and forest reserves. The following are some of the most important university units of the Aristotle University:

=== Library ===
The Aristotle University Library was founded in 1927 and is constituted of two main elements: The Central Library is housed in a separate building at the centre of the university campus; &quot;departmental libraries&quot; are owned by a university department. These two elements comprise the A.U.Th. library system, where more than 800,000 book titles and 300,000 volumes of periodicals can be found. The A.U.Th. library subscribes to 3,500 periodicals from all over the world.

The Central Library has a reading room for students and a reading room for university researchers and teaching personnel. The students&#x27; reading room has a capacity of approximately 1,300 students and can be used by any student who brings and reads his own books.

Every department of the university has its own departmental library where students can find books, periodicals, and information concerning the specific subjects their department deals with. Every departmental library has a reading room whose opening hours are determined according to the needs of the department&#x27;s students and staff.

The Aristotle University Library is nowadays the second largest library in Greece, after the National Library. Since 1976 the library has been a member of International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), which enables it to lend and borrow books from libraries all over the world.

=== Student Club ===
The University Student Club is housed in a private building located on the eastern side of the campus and plays a very important role in student life. Inside the Student Club is a restaurant, a reading room, a medical service, a snack bar, and a hairdresser&#x27;s shop. There is also a musical department and a photography club.

The Student Club is responsible for the catering and medical care of the students of A.U.Th. and University of Macedonia. Every day it caters for approximately 12,000 students. Among its other responsibilities, it also organizes artistic, cultural and athletic events and maintains a chorus and a musical department.

The third branch is located in Kalamaria.

The residence halls are reserved for students with special needs, such as members of low-income or large families, as well as some foreign students.

=== Seismological Station ===
The Aristotle University Seismological Station was founded in 1978 and is used since then for the detection and measurement of earthquakes that occur nationwide and worldwide. It is mainly used by researchers of the geophysics sector, which is a part of the Department of Geology of A.U.Th.

The Station&#x27;s main objective is to monitor Greece&#x27;s seismic activity, record and analyze the earthquakes that occur in 24-hour base, and inform the public when necessary. This is an important task given that Greece has powerful seismic activity. The personnel of the station is constituted of professors and specialized scientists with a great deal of experience concerning seismological matters.

One of the station&#x27;s primary roles is to conduct tours for the public and familiarize it with the earthquake phenomenon and how it can be dealt with. This helps to achieve better protection of the public against earthquakes.

Finally, the seismological station promotes collaboration on issues of seismological interest with a lot of other Greek and European institutions. It is also a source of information for international seismological centres concerning the seismic activity of the Mediterranean region, but also of the entire world.

=== Farm and Forest Reserves ===

The University Farm covers an area of 1.9 square kilometres and is located in the south side of Thessaloniki near the city airport. It was ceded to the Aristotle University by the Greek Ministry of Agriculture in order to cover the research and educational needs of the School of Agriculture.

Inside the farm there are 21 buildings, two of which are used throughout the whole year as convention centres where conferences, events, presentations and lectures take place. The rest 19 buildings house laboratories of the School of Agriculture, where research and educational activities take place. Furthermore, the farm is used by staff and students of the School of Agriculture in order to grow experimental crops, breed animals and conduct laboratory excises.

The farm is managed by a Board of Directors, which consists of three professors, one laboratory director, and one representative of the people working at the farm. It is elected every two years and its president is the president of the School of Agriculture.

The University Forest Reserves cover a total area of 88 square kilometres. The first one is located on the Pindus mountain range at an altitude of 1,100 to 1,200 metres and covers approximately 33 square kilometres. The second one is located in Chalkidiki at an altitude of 300 to 1,200 metres and covers approximately 55 square kilometres. Both of these university forests are used by the Faculty of Forestry and Natural Environment in order to conduct research and student training. Inside the forests there are special buildings where staff and students can stay overnight.

=== Camping facilities ===
The University Camp was initially founded in 1960. It is now located in Poseidi, Chalkidiki, in a very beautiful place by the sea, full of pine trees. It opens its gates every year during the summer period for the students and the staff of the A.U.Th. The camp consists of a restaurant, a small grocery store, a bar, basketball and beach volley courts, and many more sport and entertainment facilities.

Furthermore, student unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences, demonstrations, university occupations and so on.

The structure of a student union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: The general assembly and the board of directors. The General Assembly consists of all student-members of the union. It takes place on a regular basis and is the only decision-making body. During the general assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The board of directors makes sure that the decisions of the general assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the board of directors, among which is the union&#x27;s president, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the union.

Every year in early spring the student elections take place nationwide, during which students vote for their representatives.

All student unions in Greece are members of the &quot;National Student Union of Greece&quot; (ΕΦΕΕ – Εθνική Φοιτητική Ένωση Ελλάδας). Moreover, all Student Unions of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki form the &quot;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Student Union&quot; (ΦΕΑΠΘ – Φοιτητική Ένωση Αριστοτελείου Πανεπιστημίου Θεσσαλονίκης). Both unions, ΕΦΕΕ and ΦΕΑΠΘ, are inactive since 1995.

<text>The University of Turku (, shortened &quot;UTU&quot;) is a multidisciplinary public university with eight faculties located in the city of Turku in southwestern Finland. The university also has campuses in Rauma and Pori and research stations in Kevo and Själö.
Established in 1920, the university is the third largest in the country as measured by student enrollment, after the University of Helsinki and Tampere University. It is a member of the Coimbra Group and the European Campus of City-Universities (EC2U).

==History==

===Royal Academy of Turku===
The first university established in Turku was the Royal Academy of Turku, founded on March 26, 1640, by Queen Christina of Sweden at the suggestion of Count Per Brahe. It originated from the Turku Cathedral School, which had been established in 1276. The Royal Academy was the third university in the Swedish Empire and the only one in Finland during the period of Swedish rule.

In 1809, after Russia&#x27;s victory over Sweden in the Finnish War, Finland was annexed by Russia as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. To reduce Swedish influence and move the capital closer to Saint Petersburg, Finland&#x27;s capital was relocated from Turku to Helsinki on April 8, 1812. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, the Royal Academy was also transferred to Helsinki, where it eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. For the remainder of the 19th century, Turku did not have a university.

===University of Turku===

In 1918, university-level teaching returned to Turku with the founding of Åbo Akademi, an exclusively Swedish-speaking institution. This prompted the Finnish intelligentsia to establish a university where Finnish would be the language of instruction—the first of its kind in Finland. As a result, the modern University of Turku was founded on &quot;Kalevala&quot; Day (February 28) in 1920. A total of 22,040 people contributed to the fundraising campaign. Finland’s newly gained independence and the success of the campaign are reflected in the university&#x27;s motto: &quot;The gift of a free people to free science.&quot;

The first premises of the University of Turku were in the centre of the city, by the market square. In the 1950s a new campus was built on (&quot;Russian Hill&quot; – now known as University Hill). In the 1960s the university started to expand rapidly, a process that still continues.

The university was made a public institution in 1974.

Since 1995 the University of Turku has been a member of the Coimbra Group. In 2017, the university became a member of The European Campus of City-Universities (EC2U).

In January 2010, the Turku School of Economics merged with the University of Turku, forming a seventh faculty of the university. 

In 2021, the Faculty of Technology was established as the eighth faculty of the university.

==Enrollment==
The university has approximately 22,000 degree students. Bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees are offered both in Finnish and in English. The largest faculties are the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Science and Technology.

The University is a home for The University of Turku Graduate School (UTUGS) which consists of doctoral programmes covering all disciplines. The graduate school has approximately 2,000 doctoral candidates pursuing a PhD.

== Faculties ==
There are altogether eight faculties in the University of Turku

* Faculty of Humanities
* Faculty of Education
* Faculty of Medicine
* Faculty of Science
* Faculty of Law
* Faculty of Social Sciences
* Turku School of Economics
* Faculty of Technology

In addition to the faculties, the research and learning activities at the university take place in five independent units: Brahea Centre of the University of Turku, Centre for Language and Communication Studies, Turku PET Centre, Finnish Centre for Astronomy with ESO and Turku Bioscience Centre.

==Organization==

The university management consists of the Board, The Rector and the vice rectors and the University Collegiate Council.

&quot;The Board&quot; is the highest decision-making organ of the university and is made up of 10 members from academia, society and studentship. It develops the university&#x27;s operating processes and approves plans concerning its financing and activities; it decide on the guidelines of granting appropriations; it give its opinion in any matters of significance that concern the university in principle and the Board approves the service regulations and other similar rules.

&quot;The Rector&quot; directs the activities and processes of the university and solves any issues concerning its general management. The Rector represents the university and uses the university&#x27;s right to speak in courts of law and in dealings with the authorities. Professor Marjo Kaartinen is currently the elected Rector.

The University Collegiate Council consists of 30 members: ten professors, ten other teaching and research personnel and other staff and ten students.

==Campus area==
The University of Turku shares a campus with Åbo Akademi University and elements of Turku Science Park. The area also encompasses Turku University Hospital (TYKS) and the Student Village. The Main Building and the surrounding complex was built in the fifties on what became known as the University Hill. The campus is constantly expanding, the latest example is the Medisiina D building which houses the facilities of the Faculty of Medicine. The university also owns the Botanic Garden at Ruissalo as well as the research station at the Island of Seili. In addition to the campus area in Turku, the university also has campus areas in the nearby cities of Pori and Rauma.

==Research==
As defined in its strategy 2030, the university&#x27;s multidisciplinary research is profiled through six thematic areas which are biodiversity and sustainability; future technologies and digital society; cultural memory and social change; children, young people and learning; health, diagnostics and drug development; and sea and maritime studies.

The University of Turku has been involved in many research projects in the Peruvian Amazon. With the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute (&quot;Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana – IIAP&quot;), based in Iquitos, has been studying the Amazon in the BIODAMAZ Project.

<text>Juan d&#x27;Arienzo (December 14, 1900 – January 14, 1976) was an Argentine tango musician, also known as &quot;El Rey del Compás&quot; (&quot;King of the Beat&quot;). He was a violinist, band leader, and composer.

He was the son of Italian immigrants and used more modern arrangements and instrumentation; his popular group produced hundreds of recordings.

His first memorable performance was in 1919 at the Nacional theater during the comic play by Alberto Novión, &quot;El cabaret Montmartre&quot;.

He received the nickname Rey del Compás (King of the Beat), from Príncipe Cubano, at the Florida cabaret when he was replacing Osvaldo Fresedo. He said:
&quot;Mine was always a tough orchestra, with a very swinging, much nervous, vibrant beat. And it was that way because tango, for me, has three things: beat, impact and nuances. An orchestra ought to have, above all, life. That is why mine lasted more than fifty years. And when the Prince gave me that title, I thought that it was OK, that he was right.&quot;

His music is played often at milongas in Buenos Aires.

His recordings were accompanied by singers: Alberto Echagüe, Armando Laborde, Héctor Maure, Jorge Valdez, Alberto Reynal, Antonio Prieto, Carlos Casares, Carlos Dante, Enrique Carbel, Francisco Fiorentino, Horacio Palma, Héctor Millán, Mario Bustos, Juan Carlos Lamas, Libertad Lamarque, Mercedes Serrano, Raquel Notar, Osvaldo Ramos, Roberto Lemos and Walter Cabral.

He recorded more than 1000 tangos, milongas and fast valses, wrote lyrics for 3 tangos, composed 46 tangos.

He is interred in the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

== Filmography ==
Juan D&#x27;Arienzo participated in several movies:
* &quot;Una ventana al éxito&quot; (1966)
* &quot;La voz de mi ciudad&quot; (1953)
* &quot;El cantor del pueblo&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Yo quiero ser bataclana&quot; (1941)
* &quot;Melodías porteñas&quot; (1937)

<text>The University of Coimbra (UC; , ) is a public research university in Coimbra, Portugal. First established in Lisbon in 1290, it went through a number of relocations until moving permanently to Coimbra in 1537. The university is among the oldest universities in continuous operation in the world, the oldest in Portugal, and played an influential role in the development of higher education in the Portuguese-speaking world. In 2013, UNESCO declared the university a World Heritage Site, noting its architecture, unique culture and traditions, and historical role.

The contemporary university is organized into eight faculties, granting bachelor&#x27;s (&quot;licenciado&quot;), master&#x27;s (&quot;mestre&quot;) and doctorate (&quot;doutor&quot;) degrees in nearly all major fields. It lends its name to the Coimbra Group of European research universities founded in 1985, of which it was a founding member. Enrolling over 25,000 students, more than 15% of whom are international, it is one of Portugal&#x27;s most cosmopolitan universities.

Coimbra&#x27;s alumni over the centuries include Portugal&#x27;s national poet Luís de Camões, the mathematician Pedro Nunes, many statesmen, prime ministers and presidents of Portugal, and Nobel Prize laureate António Egaz Moniz.

==History==
The university was founded, or ratified, in 1290 by King Dinis, having begun its existence in Lisbon with the name Studium Generale (&quot;Estudo Geral&quot;). &quot;Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis&quot;, the royal charter announcing the institution of the university was dated 1 March of that year, although efforts had been made at least since 1288 to create this first University in Portugal; it is thus the second oldest of such establishments in the Iberian Peninsula. The papal confirmation was also given in 1290 (on 9 August of that year), during the papacy of Nicholas IV. In accordance with the papal bull, all the &quot;licit&quot; faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established. Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law and Medicine were the first to be created. It was, however, not to remain in Lisbon for long. In 1308, likely due to problems of emancipation from the Church (relations between the latter and the political power being somewhat strained at the time) and conflicts between the inhabitants of the city and the students, the university moved to Coimbra. This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the Monastery of Santa Cruz. The university was then established on the site known as &quot;Estudos Velhos&quot;, which corresponds roughly to the area where the Main Library now stands.

In 1338, during the reign of Afonso IV, it was once again transferred to Lisbon, from whence it returned in 1354, this time to the centre of the town which was then in full expansion. In 1377, during the reign of King Fernando, it was transferred yet again to Lisbon, where it would remain for over a century and a half. The authorization for a Faculty of Theology probably dates from this period – around 1380.
In 1537, during the reign of João III (1521–57), the university moved definitively to Coimbra, where it was installed in the Alcaçova Palace which was subsequently purchased from the royal family in 1597.

During the same 1521-57 period, significant reforms were carried out. Both the university as an institution, and all of its library&#x27;s books were moved from Lisbon to Coimbra. Most of the new faculty, previously affiliated to the Spanish University of Salamanca, was initially not tenured at Coimbra and, subsequently, professors did not generally relocate. Faculties, hitherto scattered in different buildings, were brought together in the &quot;Palacio del Rey&quot;, while other new and prestigious Spanish professors were also invited. At the faculty of Theology taught Alfonso de Prado and Antonio de Fonseca, the latter a doctor of Paris; at the faculty of Law, the famous canonist Martin de Azpilcueta (Doctor Navarrus), Manuel de Costa, and Antonio Francisco Suárez, all three from Salamanca. Meanwhile, Francisco Franco (chamber physician to John III) and Rodrigo Reinoso taught at the School of Medicine. Classical languages and literatures were taught by professors such as Cipriano Suárez, the author of a famous treatise on rhetoric (&quot;De arte rhetorica libri tres, ex Aristotele, Cicerone et Quintiliano praecipue deprompti&quot;), at the Colegio de la Artes, which young students learnt as a preparation for further academic studies; this college, independent at first, was eventually merged with the college of Theology, and entrusted to the Jesuits. One of its first professors was the Scotch Latinist George Buchanan, later a follower of John Knox and a reviler of Mary Stuart. The colleges of Sao Pedro and São Paulo were founded for graduates (doctors) intending to pursue teaching careers; other colleges received students of various religious orders.

In 1770 (23 December), King José I, following the ambitious Marquis de Pombal&#x27;s initiative, appointed a commission in charge of reorganizing the university. This commission advised the creation of two new faculties, Mathematics and Natural philosophy, leaving intact the older faculties of Theology, Canon law, Civil law, and Medicine. In the end, however, the former and hitherto successful Jesuit college was turned over to the faculty of Medicine, as it would profit from its clinics and laboratories, before being finally confiscated at the time of the expulsion of the Society from Portugal, in 1759 (Coimbra University colleges).

Among the main readings at the University of Coimbra during the Jesuit period were the books composing the influential &quot;Cursus conimbricenses&quot;a group of 11 volumes on Aristotle produced as part of King John III of Portugal&#x27;s efforts to rival the University of Paris.[1]

In the 18th century, the Marquis of Pombal, Minister of the kingdom, made radical reforms in the university, especially regarding the teaching of sciences, in accordance to his Enlightenment and anticlerical creed.
During many decades it was the only university in Portugal, since its foundation in 1290 until 1559 (a university in Évora operated between 1559 and 1759), and again between 1759 and 1911 (University of Lisbon and University of Porto were created in 1911). The long history and past predominance of the University of Coimbra made it an important focus of influence in Portugal, not only educational, but also political and social.

Initial steps towards some convergence of European higher education systems were taken with the signature of the Sorbonne declaration by the ministers in charge of higher education in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, in 1998, and later, in 1999, with the signature of the Bologna declaration. The Bologna process, aimed at creating a European Higher Education Area by implementing a comparable degree structure, common quality assurance standards and by promoting the mobility of students and faculty members, was a major revolution in Europe&#x27;s higher education. Globalization, technological change and increased international competition for scarce high-skilled labor highlighted the importance of making European higher education institutions attractive and competitive worldwide. A more integrated European Higher Education Market enhanced competition between European universities—a necessary condition for producing leading-edge innovations and for catching up with the US economy. In Portugal, the University of Coimbra decided to defer the adoption of the new Bologna Process model from 2006 to 2007/2008 (with exceptions authorized for a few programs on which a national consensus for change had been reached among institutions) in order to make the transition maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity. Only in the 2008/2009 school year did the entire university fully adopt the new programs within its 8 faculties.

==Organisation==

Its governance is assured by the Rector, the Senate and the University Assembly, the last responsible for the election of the Rector and the Senate. The Rector has the main responsibility for the strategic direction and the overall administration of the university, together with the Senate and assisted by the Administrative Council.

The university is divided into eight different faculties (Letters, Law, Medicine, Sciences &amp; Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology &amp; Education Sciences and Sports Sciences &amp; Physical Education), comprising about 25,000 students. The Faculty of Sciences and Technology (FCTUC) is the largest by number of professors and students, awards the highest number of academic degrees, and manages more classrooms and research units than any other in the UC. Both the National Legal Medicine Institute, an organization under direct supervision of the Portuguese Ministry of the Justice, which provides forensic science services to the police forces and government agencies of Portugal, and the University of Coimbra&#x27;s teaching hospital, HUC (&quot;Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra&quot;), a university hospital known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties, are managed by the Faculty of Medicine (FMUC).

The university harbours a huge central library (University of Coimbra General Library), botanical gardens (Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra), stadiums and other sports facilities (&quot;Estádio Universitário de Coimbra&quot; sports complex and &quot;Campo de Santa Cruz&quot; stadium), an astronomical observatory, a publishing house, a private chapel (São Miguel Chapel), a theatre (Teatro Académico de Gil Vicente), and many support facilities such as dining halls and studying rooms. In addition, the university manages several museums and other cultural organizations, including a science museum (Science Museum of the University of Coimbra), a museum of sacred art (&quot;Sacred Art Museum of the University of Coimbra&quot;), and an academic museum (&quot;Academic Museum of the University of Coimbra&quot;).

The university has five main campuses or other sites:
* &quot;Pólo I&quot; (the monumental ancient university core centre, with the main library and administration services, as well as faculties of law, medicine, letters, psychology, and natural sciences – active since the early university times before the 16th century, with major expansions in the 18th century and from the 1940s to the 1960s, during Estado Novo)
* &quot;Pólo II&quot; (engineering, sciences &amp; technology – built during the 1990s and 2000s)
* &quot;Pólo III&quot; (medicine, pharmacy &amp; the university hospital – built in the 1980s with major expansions in the 2000s)
* &quot;Faculdade de Economia&quot; (economics, social sciences – founded in the 1970s)
* &quot;Faculdade de Ciências do Desporto e Educação Física&quot; (sports sciences – founded in the late 1990s in the university sports complex)

==Students==


Students are represented by the students&#x27; union Associação Académica de Coimbra (AAC). Formed on 3 November 1887, it is the oldest university students&#x27; union in Portugal, with a long history of struggle against unpopular state policies, forming notable politicians and intellectuals along the way. It also harbours a very dynamic associative life, with its numerous sports and cultural sections, as well as a number of other autonomous organizations. It is an important structure of extracurricular formation of the University of Coimbra&#x27;s students and a major institution of the city itself. The AAC develops activities such as theatre, cinema, radio and television broadcast, music, choral singing, journalism or philately, as well as rowing, athletics and many other sports. Every student, and occasionally some non-students, are entitled to belong to these sections.

==Culture, sports and traditions==

The university&#x27;s academic traditions and institutions color the life of the city. The old &quot;Republics&quot; (autonomous students&#x27; residences) remain, as well as some traditional festivities, most notably the &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot; (a celebration of graduation&#x27;s end, symbolized by the burning of the ribbons with the colors of each of the eight faculties), the &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; (a homecoming), the frequent use of traditional attire, the &quot;Fado de Coimbra&quot; (Coimbra&#x27;s fado, now sung in organized shows rather than the traditional street serenades), and the academic ceremonies (namely the conferring of doctorate degrees).

The official colors of the Faculties of the University of Coimbra are:
* Faculty of Law: Red
* Faculty of Medicine: Yellow
* Faculty of Humanities: Dark Blue
* Faculty of Sciences &amp; Technology: Light Blue
* Faculty of Pharmacy: Purple
* Faculty of Economics: Red and White
* Faculty of Psychology &amp; Education Sciences: Orange
* Faculty of Sports Sciences &amp; Physical Education: Brown

These colors are used in the institutional seal and other symbols of each faculty, in the university ceremonies conferring doctorate degrees, and are also used by the students in their ribbons related with the academic traditions (see Queima das Fitas &quot;(The Burning of the Ribbons)&quot;). The color of the university seal and of the Rector&#x27;s office, representing the entire institution as a whole, is dark green. The flag of the University of Coimbra (white flag with the dark green seal in the middle) is always erected, over the top of the old university tower, on 1 March, which is the day of the university, being an occasion for a week of debates, conferences, workshops, and special events related with multiple aspects of the institution.

The Praxe (Praxis) is a body of ritual and custom founded upon ancient traditions and it is a controversial part of Coimbra&#x27;s academic life to which no university student is indifferent. Part of the attraction of Coimbra&#x27;s academic life, aside from its recognized excellence is that it is more &quot;Praxe&quot;, having unique rituals that set it apart from other institutions and give its students a special sense of participation in academic rituals that developed hundreds of years ago. Though these rituals are seen as crude and violent by some, they remain an important reference in the academic experience of the students for others. The rules of the &quot;Praxe&quot; are contained in a book (The Code of Academic Praxis, by a committee of older students of the AAC – Associação Académica de Coimbra), which prescribes appropriate student behavior for activities like drafting, evaluation, groups or bands and the Burning of the Ribbons rituals. Even inside the AAC, Coimbra&#x27;s student organisation, there are &quot;anti-Praxe&quot; groups and people who advocate for more thorough reforms in traditional rituals. The Freshman (1st yr.) period (the lowest category in the &quot;Praxe&quot; hierarchy) is, for many students, a time of good and lasting memories of never to be repeated events. One of the most visible and distinctive traditions is the use of the academic costume of the University of Coimbra, a black suit and cape worn on special occasions by the students, which was adopted by other Portuguese universities and is actually used by students of almost all higher education institutions in the city and across the country.

Praxis almost disappeared in the years after the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear if for the length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The academic attire could be completely torn at the end of studies, with the exception of the cape that would not get torn in that ritual (but could have been cut before with a different symbolism), and would be used by former students when attending Queima das Fitas. Today the academic attire is used less frequently, but it is, arguably, still used more often by students in Coimbra, than in other universities.

A student who had been enrolled more than the years of his course was a &quot;veteran&quot;. In the past, when University enrollment was a matter of social class, some students would accumulate quite a number of enrollments. The individual who had the most was Dux Veteranorum, a notable figure in the student scene at the university. In the middle 1980s for instance, the Dux Veteranorum had more than 20 enrollments in Law School but had graduated in only 2 or 3 courses. This tradition is disappearing as the university is putting constraints in the number of years a student can enroll. Most student costs are supported with public money and it is no longer found acceptable that some individuals burden finances to extend their stays without graduating. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend the university and the attraction of new types of mature students (almost always as part-time or evening class students) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the university&#x27;s gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).

The sports sections of the AAC play a significant role in Coimbra&#x27;s sport life, often being the city&#x27;s main representative in that area. They include rugby, handball, basketball, baseball, martial arts, athletics, gymnastic or swimming, among others. Just as with the cultural sections, every student, including professional or semi-professional athletes, may belong to them.

The city&#x27;s main football club, usually known as &quot;Académica&quot; or &quot;Briosa&quot;, is in formal terms an autonomous organism of the AAC and is called AAC-OAF, but in practical terms it is an independent club, only loosely connected to its mother institution. It is a relatively important team, especially as regards to its huge number of followers nationwide, and plays in the top Portuguese football leagues, having been the first winner in history of the Portuguese Football Cup, in 1939.

===Recepção ao Caloiro===
In Portugal, the homecoming is known as &quot;Recepção ao Caloiro&quot; (The Freshman&#x27;s Reception). It includes numerous events and traditions born in the 19th century in the University of Coimbra. It is defined as a welcome to the new students, the freshmen (&quot;caloiros&quot;), and takes place at the beginning of the academic year in Portuguese university towns. In every classic public university of Portugal the homecoming is celebrated yearly. The events are followed in varying degrees by other less traditional or smaller institutions. A street parade of students, concerts, and sports events are always organized for the freshmen&#x27;s reception. The street parade organized in several major Portuguese universities is known as &quot;Latada&quot;, and its name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen&#x27;s legs (the word &quot;lata&quot; is tin can in Portuguese).

====History====
&quot;The Freshman&#x27;s Reception&quot; (&quot;Recepção ao Caloiro&quot;, the Portuguese name for university homecoming) goes back to the 19th century when the law students of the University of Coimbra felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely tin cans, which is the original root of &quot;The Tin Can Parade&quot;.

====Coimbra====
In Coimbra, where the oldest Portuguese university was founded in the Middle Ages, the &quot;Recepção ao Caloiro&quot; (The Freshman&#x27;s Reception) week, includes the &quot;Festa das Latas&quot; (The Tin Can Festival). The Tin Can Festival&#x27;s name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen&#x27;s legs for the parade (The Tin Can Parade) which is known as &quot;Latada&quot;. The events are organized by the students&#x27; union of the University of Coimbra, the Associação Académica de Coimbra, and takes place during the fall. It is an important part of the &quot;praxe académica&quot; (student praxis) in Coimbra, followed by the city population as an ancient cultural manifestation and local tradition, and has become a tourist attraction for a number of visitors every year.

=====Events=====

The highlight of this homecoming, which now takes place at the beginning of the academic year (October/November) is the special parade known as the Latada. After marching through the streets of the city the new students are baptized in the Mondego River thus entering into the Coimbra academic fraternity. The second-year students are awarded their Grelos (a small ribbon). The Grelo is a small, woollen ribbon with the color(s) of the student&#x27;s faculty, that is attached to a student&#x27;s briefcase. Before this, the students must have visited the Dom Pedro V market during the morning, where they must get a turnip to sustain the Caloiros during the day&#x27;s festivities. Besides the tin cans they have tied to their legs, the new students wear all kinds of costumes made up according to the creativity and imagination of their godmothers or godfathers, who are older students. They also carry placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders. The homecoming includes the &quot;Tin Can Festival&quot; week, with concerts and several other cultural events and sports activities beyond the parade, which always happens on a Tuesday. These include the historical night-time student fado serenade which happens in the stairs of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra to a crowd of thousands of students and other spectators, every year during the celebrations.

===Queima das Fitas===

Coimbra&#x27;s &quot;Queima das Fitas&quot; (Burning of the Ribbons), the oldest and most famous in the country, is organized by a students&#x27; commission formed by members of the students&#x27; union of the University of Coimbra, the Associação Académica de Coimbra. Celebrating the end of graduation courses, symbolized by the ritual burning of the ribbons representing each faculty, it takes place at the second semester (first weekend of May), being among the biggest student festivities in Europe. It lasts for 8 days, one for each Faculty: Letters, Law, Medicine, Sciences &amp; Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology &amp; Education Sciences and Sports Sciences &amp; Physical Education. During this period, a series of concerts and performances are held, turning Coimbra in a lively and vibrant city.

===Students Lore===

Stories passed along over generations of students, the university folklore is plentiful. One student usually asked his father for money, stating &quot;Rent 20, Food 30&quot;. One day he asked &quot;Rent 20, Food 30, Hammering 20, Fixing of the hammer and medication 40.&quot; Another student had oral examinations at Law School. Unresponsive to the simplest of questions, the professor already impatient, turned to the bailiff and asked &quot;Bring in a stack of hay&quot; to which the student very quickly added &quot;And I&#x27;ll have a glass of water please.&quot;
The years of dictatorship were gruesome. Apart from the students that got 7 years in prison for toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would spend the whole night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police would have a hard time chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.

Other items are plain local knowledge:
* &quot;Black it is, Chicken made it&quot; (a pun on a children&#x27;s charade, &quot;White it is, chicken hatched it&quot;, to which the answer is &quot;the egg&quot;)—it happens that the gates of the Botanical Garden are black, and were made by a person named Chicken (Galinha).
* Bet you can&#x27;t climb the Monumental Stairs, two steps at a time, as there are 125 steps in 5 installments of 25 steps each.

Freshmen on first day of classes may have rough stuff to go through. In the escalator of the Mathematics Department it is common to see them buying season tickets to take the ride all year round, and at least once, as urban myth has it, a poster announcing &quot;Flight Insurance For This Elevator, At Sale in The Lobby&quot;, was inquired about by the newcomers.

==Business incubator and science park==
The &quot;Instituto Pedro Nunes&quot; (IPN), founded by the University of Coimbra, is a business incubator and an innovation and technology transfer center of the university, working for the business and applied research communities. The Coimbra iParque is a science park which has among its several founders and associates the University of Coimbra. Notable startup companies born from the University of Coimbra include ISA, Critical Software, Crioestaminal, Ciberbit and Feedzai.

==Academics==

===Reputation===
University of Coimbra&#x27;s reputation in teaching and research is testified by independent external rankings and reports. According to The Times Higher Education Supplement (2007 QS World University Rankings, by QS – Quacquarelli Symonds), the University of Coimbra was ranked number 3 among the universities in the Portuguese-speaking countries (behind the University of São Paulo and
the University of Campinas), and ranked 318 in the overall world rank. It was ranked number one among the universities of the Portuguese-speaking countries in 2006. It tends to be ranked number one (consistently one of the top) in Portugal, number 3 among the universities in the Portuguese-speaking countries, and number 394 in the world (234 in Natural Sciences, 260 in Engineering &amp; IT, 282 in Social Sciences, 290 in Arts &amp; Humanities, 325 in Life Sciences). In addition, it has students from 70 different nationalities; almost 20% of its students are foreigners, being among Portugal&#x27;s most international universities.

The University of Coimbra is among the major science and technology hubs for applied and fundamental research in Portugal. One of the most powerful supercomputers in Portugal belongs to the University of Coimbra and is managed by the Laboratory for Advanced Computing of the Department of Physics at the University of Coimbra. Built in the mid-2000s, the supercomputer was called &quot;Milipeia&quot;, using 528 processors and 1000 GB of memory. Its capacity has been expanded since then. The main tasks of the university&#x27;s supercomputer include modeling and calculus in molecular biology, genetics, particle physics, astrophysics, mathematics, engineering, geophysics, condensed matter physics, etc. Besides University of Coimbra&#x27;s researchers, other Portuguese scientific community members are allowed to work with &quot;Milipeia&quot;.

The university is also notorious in Portugal for being the national university with the highest rate of academic inbreeding, with 80% of its hired faculty having obtained their doctoral degrees at the University of Coimbra, this factor is most pronounced at the Faculty of Law (100%) and the Faculty of Medicine (97%).

===Organisation and length of courses===
School year calendar starts in October and finishes in July. In 2004, it was among the first universities in Portugal limiting the time for degree completion. The degree programmes have a specified minimum and maximum time for completion. The time limit is 6 years from the date of first enrolment for the 4 years degrees, and 8 years from the date of first enrolment for 6 years degrees (i.e. Medicine). After that, students have to pay the entire costs of their courses. The tuition fee for undergraduate degrees was €356/year in 2002/2003. It was increased to €880/year in 2004/2005 and to €901,23/year in 2005/2006, the maximum fee allowed to state universities by law. Even with the time limit and the increased tuition fees, the university has had a high number of applicants every year. Like other universities in Portugal, and unlike the polytechnical institutes and many private universities, the university does not have special classes for workers or night classes. Overcrowded classrooms have been frequent in some disciplines at the Faculties of Science and Technology, Law, and Economics. In those occasions, students may stand during the classes or even stay outside the classroom. These faculties have the highest abandon rate and the biggest average time for degree completion. New buildings, campus expansion and modernized infrastructures since the late 1990s and the 2000s, have solved almost all these problems.

===Admission===
Admission is strictly merit-based, and the university has several departments which are known for higher-than-average selectiveness. Numerus clausus is applied to select among competing applicants. To programmes such as medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200). Acceptance rates may vary significantly from faculty to faculty or from department to department. Foreign applicants usually make up more than 10 percent of the applicant pool, and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective state of origin or through bilateral protocols between the governments of Portugal and foreign governments. There are also a number of other extraordinary admission processes for older people (admission for candidates older than 23 years old), sportsmen, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), etc., which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each department or faculty.

==Notable alumni and students==

In chapter 6 of Voltaire&#x27;s novella &quot;Candide&quot;, first published in 1759, the narrator remarks that the University of Coimbra had decided that &quot;the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking.&quot;

In the comics series &quot;Tintin,&quot; Senhor Pedro João Dos Santos is a Portuguese physicist of the University of Coimbra. He was a member of Decimus Phostle&#x27;s expedition team to recover samples from a fallen meteorite in the Arctic Ocean, the Aurora Expedition. He is seen only in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, the tenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The story was serialised daily in &quot;Le Soir&quot;, Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from October 1941 to May 1942.

<text>The University of Lyon ( , or UdL) is a university system (&quot;ComUE&quot;) based in Lyon, France. It comprises 12 members and 9 associated institutions. The 3 main constituent universities in this center are: Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, which focuses upon health and science studies and has approximately 47,000 students; Lumière University Lyon 2, which focuses upon the social sciences and arts, and has about 30,000 students; Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, which focuses upon the law and humanities with about 20,000 students.

Following Paris and Toulouse, Lyon stands as France&#x27;s third-largest university hub. Hosting 129,000 students, 11,500 educators and researchers, along with 510 private and public laboratories, it encompasses the city&#x27;s three faculties (Lyon-1, Lyon-2, and Lyon-3), alongside the Jean Monnet University of Saint-Étienne, École Centrale de Lyon, École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, and the Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Lyon. The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France&#x27;s public institution for scientific research, is a vital member of this university network. Collaboratively, private and public higher education institutions in the Lyon region pool resources to advance and promote scientific research. Originally established between 1896 and 1968 as a centralized university amalgamating three historical faculties (sciences, arts, medicine, and law), the University of Lyon transitioned into a decentralized model under the Edgar Faure law, advocating for university autonomy. Flourishing as a prominent research hub for Egyptological studies since the late 19th century, Lyon witnessed the birth of the Institute of Egyptology in 1879. In 1975, Egyptological studies found a home in the Victor Loret Institute of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), alongside the creation of the Maison de l&#x27;Orient et de la Méditerranée.

Distinguished alumni and faculty of the University of Lyon include Nobel laureates such as Victor Grignard (Chemistry, 1912), Alexis Carrel (Medicine), Yves Chauvin (Chemistry, 2005), and Jean Jouzel (co-laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize, 2007). Notable figures also include Ume Kenjirō, architect of the Japanese civil code and former law faculty student, Cédric Villani, Fields Medal recipient and alumnus of Lyon-III, astrophysicist Hélène Courtois, pioneer of criminal anthropology Alexandre Lacassagne, and Louis Léopold Ollier, founding figure in modern orthopedic surgery.

== History ==
Lyon has historically been an industrious and mercantile city, oriented towards free trade and commerce due to its geographical location: at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers, near Switzerland and Italy, on the route between northern and southern Europe. Primarily a merchant city under the Ancien Régime, Lyon does not have a long university history: this delay is partly due to the fear that education would divert young people from commerce and industry. The first modern higher education institution in Lyon was established in 1519 under the initiative of the Brotherhood of the Trinity (&quot;Confrérie de la Trinité&quot;). On 21 July 1527, following its success, the institution came under the control of the Lyon municipality, which then assumed financial responsibility for it. The institution became the &quot;Collège Confrérie de la Trinité&quot;. It was the first coeducational institution, notably welcoming poets Louise Labé and Pernette du Guillet during the Renaissance. In the 16th century, this university college was an influential humanist centre. Amidst the religious wars between Catholic and Huguenots, the director of the institution, the poet Barthélemy Aneau, was massacred in 1561, accused of sympathising with the Reformation. In 1565, Pope Pius IV confirmed the transfer of the college’s administration to the Jesuits, a transfer later validated in 1568 by King Charles IX of France. The college expanded in the 17th century, with the works financed by Queen Anne of Austria. Besides a theatre, a library, and an observatory, the Collège de la Trinité incorporated numerous buildings not primarily intended for education, including eight congregation chapels. To construct buildings specifically for boarders, the Jesuits began acquiring properties from the 1680s onwards, with acquisitions peaking between 1712 and 1713. In 1702, an astronomical observatory was built atop the Trinity Chapel, driven by astronomer Jean de Saint-Bonnet. In 1763, following the suppression of the Jesuit order in France, the Lyon municipality ordered the institution’s takeover by the Oratorian order. Like all universities and higher education institutions of the Ancien Régime, the Collège de la Trinité was abolished by the National Convention on 15 September 1793 during the Revolution, on the grounds that they were too aristocratic and did not align with the revolutionaries&#x27; vision of public education accessible to all.

In 1806, Napoleon I established the University of France, an institution that centralised all faculties in France. Ephemeral faculties of arts and sciences were created in Lyon during this period but were abolished during the Bourbon Restoration in 1815. At the beginning of the 19th century, it had a total of 2,551 students, making it the largest university in the country after Paris. The modern faculties, ancestors of the University of Lyon, were established under the July Monarchy: the Faculty of Sciences of Lyon opened its doors in 1833, the Faculty of Letters in 1838, the Faculty of Theology in 1839 (transformed into the Catholic Faculty in 1885), the Faculty of Law in 1875 by decree of President Mac Mahon, and the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy in 1877. The law of 10 July 1896 formally created the University of Lyon, composed of these faculties. Each faculty maintained a high degree of autonomy despite sharing what was then known as the &quot;Palais des Facultés&quot;, now the Palais Hirsch, located on the left bank of the Rhône at Quai Claude-Bernard. By 1920, Lyon had over 3,500 university students, making it the second largest university in the country after Paris, which had 17,000 students. The University of Lyon in this centralised form existed until 1968.

As with all universities in France, following the events of May 1968, the University of Lyon was replaced by autonomous faculties. The Edgar Faure law aimed to grant greater autonomy to faculties and break with the highly centralised vision that had governed higher education in France since 1896. The law provided a legal status of autonomy to the faculties, that of &quot;public establishments of a scientific and cultural nature.&quot; The University of Lyon was then divided into three autonomous entities: University Lyon-I - &quot;Claude Bernard&quot; (former faculty of medicine and pharmacy, now a university of sciences), University Lyon-II - &quot;Lumière&quot; (former faculty of letters, now a university dedicated to the humanities, social sciences, and arts), and University Lyon-III - &quot;Jean Moulin&quot; (former faculty of law, now a university dedicated to law and political science). The University of Sciences Lyon-I is named Claude Bernard in honour of this eminent physiologist and scientist; the University of Lyon-II is named Lumière in reference to the brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière, the inventors of cinema; the University Lyon-III is named Jean Moulin in honour of the prefect and resistance leader during World War II, who unified the French Resistance and died under torture by the Gestapo in Lyon in 1943.

== Structure ==
After Paris and Toulouse, Lyon is the third largest university city in France with 2,335 students in 1898, 36,500 students in 1973, 42,600 students in 1978, 50,000 students in 1982, and 52,000 students in 1985; in 2024, Lyon has 175,000 students, including 23,000 international students, and 11,500 researchers and faculty members. The university has a total of 510 private and public laboratories, and an average of 800 doctoral theses are defended there each year. The university comprises a total of 510 private and public laboratories, 18 doctoral schools, and an average of 800 doctoral theses are defended there each year. The doctoral schools are divided into five categories: life sciences (biological sciences, health, neurobiology, sciences and cognition, cancerology and biology), exact sciences (electronics and electrotechnics, mechanics and civil engineering, chemistry, materials, engineering, computer science and mathematics, physics and astrophysics), and humanities and social sciences (social sciences, literature, languages and linguistics, education and psychology, economics and management, philosophy and history, law).

UdL, on behalf of its member institutions, oversees several major projects related to the &quot;Investments for the Future&quot; programme, for which it has secured nearly one billion euros in funding. As part of these major projects, 12 laboratories have been awarded the &quot;&quot;Laboratoire d&#x27;Excellence&quot; (LabEx) label, and 8 projects have received the &quot;Equipement d&#x27;Excellence&quot;&quot; (EquipEx) label from the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation. Additionally, 3 of its research institutes have been awarded the Carnot label, which is given to public research laboratories conducting scientific research in public-private partnerships.

As part of the France 2030 programme, launched in 2021 by the French government with a total budget of €54 billion, the UdL has established a technology transfer acceleration company (&quot;société d&#x27;Accélération du Transfert de Technologies&quot;, SATT). This subsidiary, created by one or more institutions (universities and research organisations), aims to professionalise the valorisation of public research. The company is responsible for managing patent applications, proof-of-concept operations, startup creation, and licensing. The University of Lyon&#x27;s SATT, called PULSALYS, has a budget of €57 million over 10 years to strengthen the collaboration between fundamental research and entrepreneurship.

<text>Francisco Canaro, also known by the nickname Pirincho, (November 26, 1888 – December 14, 1964) was a Uruguayan violinist and tango orchestra leader.

Canaro was born in San José de Mayo, Uruguay, in 1888. His parents were Italian immigrants, and later, when he was less than 10 years old, they emigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina in the late nineteenth century. As a young man he found work in a factory, where an empty oil can, in his skilled hands, became his first violin. Performing in seedy bars initially, he ultimately forged a career that spanned many decades, and his orchestra was one of the most recorded. His introduction to the tango came by orquesta típica leader Vicente Greco in 1908, and in 1912 he composed &quot;Pinta brava&quot; (&quot;Fierce Look&quot;). Canaro composed the music for the 1915 Argentine classic film &quot;Nobleza gaucha&quot;. He later was romantically attached to Argentine actress and tango vocalist Ada Falcón, but the relationship, which began in the early 1920s, grew apart a decade later. 
In 1920 Canaro discovered Azucena Maizani, who rapidly developed into a major tango star.

Canaro was active in the cause of intellectual property rights from 1918 onwards, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Argentine Society of Composers and Songwriters (SADAIC), in 1935, purchasing the downtown Buenos Aires lot where its headquarters were built. He performed in Paris with his orchestra in 1925, and a success among local audiences, he remained in Europe for a decade. Becoming a naturalized Argentine citizen in 1940, much of his recorded music is in the classic salon style of that decade, but he is also considered a member of the old guard, and some of his later recordings contributed to the transition to concert tango.

Canaro&#x27;s orchestra became a fixture on Argentine radio during the 1940s and early 1950s, though for many contemporary dancers and listeners, his early golden age recordings remained the best in their genre. Canaro authored his memoirs, &quot;Mis 50 años con el tango&quot; (&quot;My Fifty Years with the Tango&quot;) in 1956, but later developed Paget&#x27;s disease, and was forced to retire. He died in Buenos Aires in 1964.

<text>Wołów (, ) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in south-western Poland. It is the seat of Wołów County and Gmina Wołów. It lies approximately north-west of the regional capital Wrocław. , the town has a population of 12,373. It is part of the larger Wrocław metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name is derived from the Polish word &quot;wół&quot; (&quot;ox&quot;).

==History==
The area around Wołów has been settled since prehistoric times. It became part of the emerging Polish state in the late 10th century under Mieszko I of Poland. The town was first mentioned in 1157 when a wooden castle founded by Senior Duke of Poland Władysław II the Exile is documented, which developed into a castle complex, which was again mentioned in 1202. Two villages developed near the castle, one of them called Wołowo. Probably in the second half of the 13th century the town was founded near Wołowo and partially on the soil of the second village. Wołów received Magdeburg town rights about 1285 at the time of German Ostsiedlung in the region; a Vogt is mentioned in 1288.

At that time Wołów belonged to the Duchy of Głogów, after 1312 to the Duchy of Oleśnica. With the duchy it came under the suzerainty of Bohemia in 1328. Since the 15th century, the town was a center of clothmaking. From 1473 dates the oldest known seal of the town, which already shows an ox, as do all later seals. Wołów was ruled by local Polish dukes until 1492, and soon after, in 1495, it came into the possession of the Czech Podiebrad family, then in 1517 it came into the hands the Hungarian magnate Johann Thurzó, before returning to Piast rule in 1523, by passing to the Duchy of Legnica. It remained there until the Piast dukes of Legnica-Brzeg-Wołów died out in 1675. As a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town&#x27;s population fell by half.

The Protestant Reformation was introduced to the town in 1522 by duke Frederick II. After the extinction of the local Piasts the duchy passed to the House of Habsburg, which opposed the Protestant denomination in the town, as part of the Counter-Reformation. In 1682 the town&#x27;s parish church was closed and given to the Catholics. According to the Treaty of Altranstädt the church however was already returned to the Protestants in 1707 and stayed Protestant until 1945. The small Catholic minority in return received a Josephinian curacy.

In 1742 Wołów was annexed by Prussia. The duchy was divided into two districts and the town became county seat of one of the districts. The structure of the town was, until 1700, defined by craft, especially clothiers. As the seat of a duchy and a district administrative function however became more and more important. The industrialization played only a minor role and mostly affected smaller companies of the timber industry. In 1781 the city suffered a fire.
The town was part of Germany from 1871 to 1945. During World War I, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Allied prisoners of war in the town. During World War II, the Germans operated a youth prison in the town, with multiple forced labour subcamps in the region, including one in the town itself. In 1943–1945, the Germans carried out mass executions of Allied prisoners of war in the forest in the present-day district of Gancarz. In January 1945 – just before town was taken by the Red Army – the Wehrmacht evacuated the German population westwards. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the town became again part of Poland. The totality of the town&#x27;s previous population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

Deportation of Germans from the surrounding villages proceeded in 1945-46. Often, the local mayor announced at eve that families were to show up for deportation the next morning. Very often, the victims&#x27; luggage was plundered.

In 1962, the town was the site of the Wołów bank robbery, one of the largest bank robberies in Poland.

==Sports==
