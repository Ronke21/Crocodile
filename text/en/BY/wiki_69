<text>The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages or sexual maturity rating (SMR)) is a scale of physical development as pre-pubescent children transition into adolescence, and then adulthood. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, length of the penis, volume of the testes, and growth of pubic hair. This scale was first quantified in 1969 by James Tanner, a British pediatrician, after a two-decade-long study following the physical changes in girls undergoing puberty.

Due to natural variation, individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of puberty. Among researchers who study puberty, the Tanner scale is commonly considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing pubertal status when it is conducted by a trained medical examiner. In HIV treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which regimen to follow for pediatric or adolescent patients on antiretroviral therapy (adult, adolescent, or pediatric guidelines). The Tanner scale has also been used in forensics to determine aging, but its usage has decreased due to lack of reliability.

==Stages==
Adapted from &quot;Adolescent Health Care: A Practical Guide&quot; by Lawrence Neinstein.

===Genitals (male)===

; Tanner I
: testicular volume less than 1.5 ml; small penis (prepubertal) 
; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged 
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis further increases in length and starts to increase in breadth
; Tanner V
: testicular volume greater than or equal to 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis

===Breasts (female)===

; Tanner I
: no glandular tissue: areola follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal)
; Tanner II
: breast bud forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen 
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and papilla form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===
; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all (prepubertal)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum (males) or on the labia majora (females) 
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally
; Tanner IV
: adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs

==Height==
During Tanner V, females stop growing and reach their adult height. Usually, this happens in their mid teens at 14 or 15 years for females. 

Males also stop growing and reach their adult height during Tanner V; usually this happens in their late teens at 16 to 17 years, but can be a lot later, even into the early 20s.

==Historical data==
In 1970, boys reached the last Tanner stage, the postpubertal stage, on average at the age of 14.9 years and girls around the age of 14 depending on social class and the particular study. In the nearly fifty years since those studies, the ages at which children are beginning puberty has only declined: () &quot;The age of puberty, especially female puberty, has been decreasing in western cultures for decades now [...] for example, at the turn of the 20th century, the average age for an American girl to get her period was 16 or 17. Today, that number has decreased to 12 or 13 years.&quot;

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the pornography industry for its potential to lead to false child pornography convictions, such as in the case of pornographic actress Lupe Fuentes where in 2009 United States federal authorities used it to assert that she was not an adult despite her age. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.

Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale misrepresents the intended use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.

<text>Power Station at BerkleeNYC is a recording studio on 441 West 53rd Street in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It was originally founded in 1977 as Power Station and known as Avatar Studios from 1996 to 2017. Renowned for its exceptional acoustics, the studio has been the site of hundreds of gold, platinum, and Grammy Award-winning recordings.

==History==
=== Background ===

Producer Tony Bongiovi and former Mediasound Studios co-worker engineer Bob Walters partnered to open the recording studio, putting together a team of people that included engineer Ed Stasium, Ed Evans, and Bob Clearmountain. They located an abandoned building on 441 West 53rd Street, between Ninth and Tenth avenues, in New York City&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood, which Bongiovi purchased from New York City for $360,000 as part of a building rehabilitation program. Bongiovi, Walters, and their team worked with Stephen B. Jacobs Associates to design a studio that would apply Bongiovi&#x27;s ideas regarding acoustics, naming the new studio Power Station in acknowledgment of the building&#x27;s origins as a former Consolidated Edison power station.

=== Power Station (1977-1996) ===
Power Station opened in 1977, The studio&#x27;s largest room, Studio A, is a pine-paneled 52 x 48 foot space with 35-foot ceilings and several isolation booths and a control room equipped with a 40-channel Neve 8068 mixing console.

The new studio became a favorite for the Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards project Chic, which recorded several hit albums with Clearmountain at Power Station in the late 1970s. Chic&#x27;s production team also collaborated on Sister Sledge&#x27;s hit album &quot;We Are Family&quot; and Diana Ross&#x27; best-selling album &quot;Diana&quot; at the studios. In 1979, Ian Hunter recorded his album &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone with a Schizophrenic&quot; at the studio with members of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band as the backing band. In 1979 Springsteen himself came to the Power Station to work on what would become his only double-album, &quot;The River&quot;. Other albums recorded at the studio in 1980 included David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;, Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Come Upstairs&quot;, Suicide&#x27;s Ric Ocasek-produced , and Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Making Movies&quot;, co-produced by a young Jimmy Iovine. 

Choosing Nile Rodgers to produce his next album, David Bowie returned to Power Station to record his massively successful album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, which featured players from Chic and then-unknown Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. Dire Straits returned to the studio for &quot;Love over Gold&quot; (1982), and John Waite recorded his debut solo album there the same year. Roxy Music recorded &quot;Avalon&quot; at Power Station with Clearmountain, and Pat Metheny Group recorded the first of many albums they would record at the studios. In 1982, Jim Steinman produced two songs at Power Station that would simultaneously top the Billboard charts the following year: Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s biggest career hit, &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; and Air Supply&#x27;s &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;.

Mark Knopfler returned to the studio to record his award-winning soundtrack album, &quot;Local Hero&quot;, and Bob Dylan recorded &quot;Infidels&quot; at Power Station in 1983. 1984 marked the recording of Bon Jovi&#x27;s debut studio album, the band&#x27;s frontman no other than studio co-founder Bongiovi&#x27;s cousin Jon Bon Jovi, who had been working at the studio since 1980. The same year, Bruce Springsteen recorded much of his hit album &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; at Power Station, and Madonna chose to record &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; with Nile Rodgers at the studio. In 1984, a supergroup composed of Robert Palmer, Chic drummer Tony Thompson, and Andy and John Taylor of Duran Duran came to the studio to record a one-off album, subsequently naming both the group and its debut album The Power Station after the studio where it was recorded. In 1986, Cyndi Lauper recorded &quot;True Colors&quot; and Peter Gabriel recorded &quot;So&quot; at Power Station. Other artists recording at the studio in the 1980s included Keith Jarrett, Bill Frisell, Grace Jones, Lou Reed, James Taylor, Bobby McFerrin, and Eurythmics.

In the 1990s, Jim Steinman returned to Power Station with Meat Loaf for the recording of &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;, and the studio became popular with jazz musicians, including John Scofield, Joshua Redman, and Diana Krall. By 1995, over 400 gold and platinum records had been recorded at Power Station, and that year, 9 of the 13 major Grammy award winners were recorded and/or mixed at Power Station.

=== Avatar Studios (1996-2016) ===
In May 1996, Chieko and Kirk Imamura bought the entire building from Bongiovi in a bankruptcy auction for $5.4 million, and continued to run the business as Avatar Studios (under the Avatar Entertainment Corporation).

In 2015, the studio was up for sale again, but the owners would only consider offers from buyers who want to keep it as a recording studio.

=== Power Station at BerkleeNYC (2017-present) ===
In September 2017, with the support of the New York City Mayor&#x27;s Office of Media and Entertainment and the Economic Development Corporation, Pete Muller with Berklee College of Music acquired the studios and renamed them Power Station at BerkleeNYC. The studio reopened in 2020 after a full renovation, while maintaining the studio spaces.

== Power Station New England ==
In 1995, Sonalysts, which had begun as an underwater acoustics research company, licensed the Power Station&#x27;s design and naming rights from Bongiovi and Walters. The company built a perfect replica of the original Studio A in Waterford, Connecticut, as a part of the new Power Station New England.

<text>Fernando James Ferrer (born April 30, 1950) is an American politician who was the borough president of The Bronx from 1987 to 2001. Ferrer was a candidate for mayor of New York City in 1997 and 2001 and was the Democratic Party nominee for mayor in 2005, when he was defeated by Michael Bloomberg. Ferrer served on the New York City Council in the 1980s and has served as chairman and vice chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

==Early life and education==
Ferrer grew up in the Longwood section of the South Bronx. He graduated from Catholic schools in the Bronx: St. Anselm Elementary School and Cardinal Spellman High School. Ferrer earned his B.A. degree from the University Heights Campus of New York University and his M.P.A. from Baruch College.

==Career==
===New York City Council===
Ferrer represented the former 13 City Council district in the Bronx from 1982 to 1987. Ferrer authored legislation requiring interpreters in city emergency rooms. Ferrer went on to chair the Health Committee, fight for anti-discrimination laws on behalf of gays and lesbians, and lead the fight for a Civilian Complaint Review Board for the NYPD.

=== Bronx Borough President ===
Ferrer was appointed Bronx Borough President as the result of incumbent Stanley Simon&#x27;s resignation in connection with the Wedtech scandal. In 1987, Simon, aware that he had been under investigation and that charges against him were pending, resigned from his post. Ferrer began his 14-year tenure as Bronx borough president when the borough was a symbol of urban decay and neglect. National attention led to a federal commitment to rebuild. During the Ferrer administration housing was created for about 66,000 families. The borough saw a significant drop in crime, particularly in the South Bronx neighborhood, and a steady rise in business and real estate investment.

=== Campaigns for Mayor of New York City ===
==== 1997 mayoral campaign ====

In 1997, Ferrer launched a campaign for Mayor of New York. Trailing in the polls and under increased pressure from party insiders for a unified Democratic Party, he abruptly dropped out and endorsed the eventual Democratic nominee, Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger.

==== 2001 mayoral campaign ====

In the 2001 election, Ferrer ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor. He won the first primary with 34%, but failed to win the necessary 40% to secure the nomination and ultimately lost a divisive runoff election to Mark Green following the September 11th terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers. Ferrer, who is of Puerto Rican descent, received a high level of support from Hispanic voters but not from African-Americans.

==== 2005 mayoral campaign ====

Ferrer was the Democratic candidate for mayor in 2005.

Ferrer&#x27;s campaign was hurt by remarks he made in March 2005 concerning the Amadou Diallo shooting. Ferrer, who&#x27;d marched in protest against the shooting when it occurred and had gotten arrested, expressed his belief to the New York City Police Department Sergeants Benevolent Association that the incident was a &quot;tragedy,&quot; but &quot;not a crime.&quot; He was strongly criticized by Diallo&#x27;s family and others for these remarks, and he slid in popularity polls, especially among African-Americans.

Ferrer prevailed in the primary election held on September 13, 2005. The first tally indicated that Ferrer garnered 39.95% of the final vote. He needed 40% to avoid a runoff, but Anthony D. Weiner, the second-place finisher, conceded, thus ensuring that Ferrer would advance to the general election. A final count indicated that Ferrer actually received 40.15% of the votes.

Political analyst Fred Siegel summarized Ferrer&#x27;s campaign as follows:
:If anyone doubted the hapless nature of Ferrer&#x27;s campaign they had only to watch his ads featuring the rotund Reverend Al Sharpton salsa dancing. In Fernando Ferrer&#x27;s losing bid for mayor, that was about as innovative as things got. The campaign was also plagued by revenue problems as the ads they wished to use were too long and hence too expensive and these &quot;salsa&quot; ads were done to save money but also to hopefully get the campaign some needed attention. Sadly, the focus became Al Sharpton and the others used in these ads rather than the message they tried to convey.

Ferrer&#x27;s campaign was hurt when the &quot;New York Times&quot; and other big newspapers endorsed Mike Bloomberg. Also, Ferrer&#x27;s campaign relied mainly on small contributions, compared to Bloomberg&#x27;s $96 million from his personal billion dollar fortune.

Bloomberg defeated Ferrer, 58.4%-39.0%, on Election Day. Polls taken just days before had indicated that Ferrer would lose by between 30 and 35 percent.

===MTA Chairman===
Andrew Cuomo appointed Ferrer to run the MTA as interim Chairman on three separate occasions.

==Personal life==
As of 2005, Ferrer resided in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.

<text>&quot;Victrola&quot; is a single by the band Veruca Salt. It was released in 1995 on Minty Fresh Records. It includes a cover of The Knack&#x27;s &quot;My Sharona&quot;.

The cover artwork does not actually depict a Victrola (a brand name of early phonograph with the horn inside a wooden cabinet), but rather an early 20th-century outside horn gramophone or phonograph.

The single was the third release from the album &quot;American Thighs&quot; but unlike the first two, failed to reach the Top 75 Singles Chart in the UK, peaking at number 88.

<doc id="713404" wikidata="Q26906" url="?curid=713404" title="Ciudad Bolívar">
<text>Ciudad Bolívar (; Spanish for &quot;Bolivar City&quot;), formerly known as Angostura and St. Thomas de Guyana, is the capital of Venezuela&#x27;s southeastern Bolívar State. It lies at the spot where the Orinoco River narrows to about in width, is the site of the first bridge across the river, and is a major riverport for the eastern regions of Venezuela.

Historic Angostura gave its name to the Congress of Angostura, to the Angostura tree, to the House of Angostura, and to Angostura bitters. Modern Ciudad Bolívar has a well-preserved historic center; a cathedral and other original colonial buildings surround the Plaza Bolívar.

==History==

Originally a Spanish settlement, it was called Santo Tomé de Guayana (Saint Thomas of Guyana). The settlement was a fortified port which had to be moved on three occasions because it was constantly attacked by Carib natives and European rivals, such as the Dutch and English.

In 1576 &quot;Saint Thomas of Guyana&quot; was first located in present-day Ciudad Guayana by missionaries near the Caroní River until Dutch forces led by Captain Adrian Janson destroyed the town in 1579. The second settlement was founded by Don Antonio de Berrío in 1595, who had arrived from the New Granada with the mission of colonizing Guiana, and was moved westward down the Carońi about . One of Walter Raleigh&#x27;s expeditions sacked the second settlement in 1617, resulting in the death of his son Watt Raleigh.

Fernando de Berrio was present on March 11, 1619 in the destroyed Saint Thomas of Guyana with the credentials granted by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe, just a few months after the decapitation of Raleigh in 1618.

The first task was the reconstruction of Saint Thomas of Guyana on the sides of Chirica, a more defensible and suitable place for tobacco cultivation. Berrio commissioned Captain Jerónimo de Grados and Alonso de Monteros to recruit indigenous in the Esequibo River, but they were captured by British pirates for whose freedom they intended to collect a ransom translated into a few quintals of tobacco in branch. Finally Saint Thomas of Guyana was refounded by Fernando de Berrio in 1620.

In 1629, English and Dutch pirates, under the command of Adrian Jansz Pater, attacked and destroyed Saint Thomas of Guyana and afterwards fortified themselves in the branches and creeks of the Orinoco River.

In 1637 the Dutch, settled at the mouths of the Amakura, Essequibo and Berbice, again attacked and burned Saint Thomas of Guyana and raided Trinidad.

The fourth and present day city was officially founded in 1764 by Don Joaquin Moreno de Mendoza as San Tomas de la Nueva Guayana, Santo Tomé de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco, or San Tomé de Angostura, named in honor of its diocese and for its position at the first narrows of the Orinoco River. The Spanish relied on trade from the Dutch colony of Essequibo further down the Caroní River until 1771.

Angostura was the capital of Guayana Province and the site of the Congress of Angostura from 1819 to 1821. It was responsible for the creation of Gran Colombia in its first year of operation. Angostura bitters were invented in the city in 1824, although the company which produced them later moved to Trinidad and Tobago.

The city was renamed in honor of Simon Bolivar in 1846.

The Venezuelan artist Jesús Rafael Soto was a native of the city. The Jesús Soto Museum of Modern Art, named in his honor and designed by Venezuelan architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva, was opened in 1973.

<text>Theophilus Cazenove, or Theophile Cazenove (13 October 1740 – 6 March 1811), was a Dutch financier and one of the agents of the Holland Land Company.

== Life and career ==
Theophilus Cazenove was baptized in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam as the son of Théophile Cazenove (–1760) and Marie de Rapin-Thoyras, both French/Swiss Huguenots. The couple had seven children.

His grandfather was Paul de Rapin, a historian, who fled to the Netherlands. His father was a merchant-banker who traded on Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, Stockholm, and the West Indies. In 1759 he lost four ships loaded with sugar and coffee, which were taken by a Bristol privateer. In 1760, the elder Théophile gave up his business and his sons Charles and Theophile the Younger assumed control of the company. In 1762 Charles was involved in a fight with Marc-Michel Rey, the publisher of Rousseau.

==Career==
Cazenove spent his early career in commercial transactions in France and Russia, but went almost bankrupt during the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763, collaborating with L.P. de Neufville and Hope &amp; Co. Only a few weeks later he married Margaretha Helena van Jever (1747–1833), the daughter of a tradesman in Russia, and a member of the vroedschap. The couple lived at Raamgracht with a view on Zuiderkerk, but in 1766 they sold the house and his mother, who remarried in 1763, had moved to Vevey. Theophile was involved in a plantation in Surinam with his father-in-law. In 1770, he had his portrait painted by Jean-Baptiste Perronneau. In 1788, he collaborated with Étienne Clavière and Jacques Pierre Brissot, who both traveled to the United States.

In November 1789, Cazenove was retained by Pieter Stadnitski to travel to the United States to act as an investment agent for Stadnitski and other Dutch investors, including Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst, Pieter &amp; Christiaen Van Eeghen, and Ten Cate &amp; Vollenhoven. Casenove settled in at Market Street in Philadelphia, where he dealt with financier Robert Morris; his fellow traveller Gerrit Boon later went north. Boon believed that harvesting maple syrup could be a year-round activity, so slavery on the sugarcane plantations could be avoided.

In 1792, Cazenove invested his clients&#x27; money in development bonds issued by the new states and the federal government, after Alexander Hamilton promised to pay the debt in full. Another venture included investing in large tracts of undeveloped land in Genesee County, New York, which included the Holland Purchase. In order to implement these large and difficult purchases (sometimes complicated by the claims of Native Americans), he employed the advisory services of Hamilton and, later, Aaron Burr.

Cazenove lived well as a &quot;grand seigneur&quot; and was known for his extreme carelessness. His business dealings in maple syrup and canals were not particularly successful and the investors barely made any profit, even losing money in the Pennsylvania land dealings which he organized with James Wilson. He was also hard-pressed to account for funds that were under his control. During this period he helped his cousin from Geneva, Antoine Charles Cazenove, settle in Philadelphia. Alexander Baring wrote: &quot;Cazenove is a sad dirty fellow and does all the mischief he can.&quot; In 1798, he hired Joseph Ellicott, to survey the Holland Land Purchase; Paul Busti became his successor in 1799.

Although he became an American citizen in 1794, Cazenove returned to Europe in 1799. In Amsterdam, he began to archive purchase of land for the financiers. He left the employment of the Dutch investors in 1802 and sought a position under Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who he had met in Philadelphia in 1795. Cazenove died on 6 March 1811 in Paris at the Hôtel de Galliffet, 84 rue du Bac, owned by Talleyrand.

=== Legacy ===
Cazenove&#x27;s correspondence, along with the records of the Holland Land Company, is held in the Amsterdam City Archives.

A number of locations in New York state are named after him, including the Village of Cazenovia, Town of Cazenovia, Cazenovia College, Cazenovia Lake, and Cazenovia Creek.

<text>Sophos Limited is a British security software and hardware company. It develops and markets managed security services and cybersecurity software and hardware, such as managed detection and response, incident response and endpoint security software. Sophos was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Thoma Bravo, an American private equity firm in March 2020.

== History ==
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on developing and selling antivirus technology and embarked on a program of international expansion.

In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax Partners.

In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008) was accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.

In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise US$100 million on the London Stock Exchange. Sophos was floated on the FTSE in September 2015.

On 14 October 2019, Sophos announced that Thoma Bravo, a US-based private equity firm, made an offer to acquire Sophos for US$7.40 per share, representing an enterprise value of approximately US$3.9 billion. The board of directors of Sophos stated their intention to recommend the offer to the company&#x27;s shareholders unanimously. On 2 March 2020, Sophos announced the completion of the acquisition.

In February 2024, President Joe Levy was appointed acting CEO after Kris Hagerman resigned from the CEO position. Mr. Levy was named the permanent CEO in May 2024.

In October 2024, Sophos released a report about their Pacific Rim counter-offensive operation, detailing actions taken against China-based adversaries along with additional information concerning this effort. It was reported by &quot;Wired&quot; that the company had been targeted for years by hackers affiliated with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Sichuan Silence Information Technology, a company associated with China&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security. The attacks were attributed to Chinese advanced persistent threats such as APT41, APT31, and Volt Typhoon. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asked for the public&#x27;s help in identifying the attackers.

== Acquisitions and partnerships ==
In 2003, Sophos acquired ActiveState, a Canadian software company that developed anti-spam software. From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.

In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, United States, which developed and sold security policy compliance and network access control (NAC) software.

In July 2008, Sophos agreed to acquire Utimaco, a publicly-held company focused on encryption and other data security products, for over $340 million; the acquisition closed for $314 million in September 2008. In October 2013, Utimaco was divested via a management buyout involving investors PINOVA Capital and BIP Investment Partners.

In May 2011, Sophos announced the acquisition of Astaro, a privately held provider of network security products, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA and Karlsruhe, Germany. At the time Astaro was the 4th largest UTM (Unified Threat Management) vendor and while the deal made sense at the time Forbes questioned its viability. Sophos subsequently renamed the Astaro UTM to Sophos UTM.

In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products.

In December 2015, Sophos merged with Surfright, the company behind the malware scanner HitmanPro. They would later integrate HitmanPro Alert, an anti malicious program designed to detect malicious behavior and stop it into Sophos.

In November 2016, Sophos acquired Barricade, a start-up with a behavior-based analytics engine.

In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.

In October 2024, Sophos agreed to acquire SecureWorks, a publicly-held company majority owned by Dell focused on Extended Detection and Response (XDR), for $859 million. The acquisition was completed in February 2025, and was closely followed by a layoff of 6% (or an estimated 400 people) from the combined workforce.

<text>General elections were held in Luxembourg on 13 June 2004, alongside European Parliament elections. The ruling Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV) of Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker won the election, increasing its number of seats to its highest since before 1989 and its share of the vote to levels not seen since the 1959 election.

As expected, the CSV won a plurality of seats, adding 5 new deputies, and continued as the majority partner in the coalition government. However, the junior partner changed from the liberal Democratic Party (DP), which lost 5 seats, to the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP), which gained one seat. The Greens also slightly increased their representation, whilst the Alternative Democratic Reform Party (ADR) lost ground.

The election coincided with the 2004 European Parliament election.

==Candidates==
==Results==
===By locality===

The CSV won pluralities in all four districts; in the previous election, the Democratic Party had won a plurality in Centre. However, the CSV won a better-than-average increase in their vote share in Luxembourg City (of 7.4%) and Centre generally (7.5%), wiping out the DP&#x27;s advantage and winning 2 deputies in that circonscription alone. The CSV&#x27;s vote remaining roughly constant across all circonscriptions (in all cases between 35.5% and 38.6%):

The CSV won pluralities across almost all of the country, winning more votes than any other party in 111 of the country&#x27;s (then) 118 communes. The LSAP won pluralities in five communes in the industrial Red Lands: Differdange, Dudelange, Kayl, Rumelange, Schifflange. The DP won the northern communes of Schieren and Préizerdaul.

<doc id="713442" wikidata="Q1817063" url="?curid=713442" title="Lemon &amp; Paeroa">
<text>Lemon &amp; Paeroa, often shortened to L&amp;P, is a sweet, lemon-flavoured soft drink manufactured in New Zealand. It is considered Kiwiana, and was traditionally made by combining lemon juice with naturally carbonated mineral water from the town of Paeroa. Today, it is manufactured by multi-national Coca-Cola. The origin date of the drink is uncertain, but the brand estimates 1908.

In the township of Paeroa, the origin place of the drink, there is a tall Lemon &amp; Paeroa bottle statue. It is one of the most photographed locations in the country, and is also considered a New Zealand icon.

==History==

Originally, Lemon &amp; Paeroa used naturally carbonated water from a spring in the town of Paeroa. The spring is located near the Ohinemuri and Waihou rivers. The land at the spring was originally used to service gold mines, and was a cow paddock when the spring was discovered. Locals frequently visited the spring following its discovery to drink the water. This was a time before anyone had thought of commercialising it.

James Coote and Alexander Hogg, who were both from Paeroa, owned the land where the spring was located. In August 1887 they subdivided the property, transferring the plot with the spring (13 acres) to Sir John Logan Campbell. The land was bought by timber merchant James McAndrew in 1896, who built a sawmill there. The land then transferred through several owners during the next decade until December 1908, when Robert Fewell and his brother-in-law, Frank Brinkler, bought the sawmill and the land around it including the spring.

Analysis of the spring&#x27;s water in 1904 carried out by Arthur Wohlman revealed magnesium bicarbonate in a concentration of 73 grains to the gallon (1040 mg/L), that the water had a temperature of , and that the water also had a pleasant taste. Wohlman believed that it had medicinal benefits, such as for constipation. Wohlman believed that due to the colony&#x27;s widespread consumption of tea, demand for the spring&#x27;s water would be limited.

In 1909 Fewell started bottling the spring water commercially. He erected a steam pump at the spring and built a concrete reservoir to hold the water pumped up. A bottling plant was constructed that could manage 500 dozen bottles per day. Samples of the water were exhibited at the Auckland Winter Exhibition in May 1909. Fewell incorporated the Paeroa Natural Mineral Water Company in March 1910. This company sold cases of bottled mineral water rather than Lemon &amp; Paeroa. Fewell&#x27;s factory burnt down in July 1912, but was probably rebuilt as the bottled water continued to be sold. Fewell left Paeroa to live in Auckland in 1914.

In 1915, the Paeroa Natural Mineral Water Company and the property the spring sits on was sold to Grey &amp; Menzies Limited, and by November 1915 &#x27;Lemon and Paeroa&#x27; was being advertised. In 1916 Grey &amp; Menzies advertised their &quot;new idea&quot; of bottled Paeroa mineral water with added lemon. Grey &amp; Menzies later opened a new factory in Paeroa in 1926 producing plain mineral water, but also had a factory in Auckland.

Water from Paeroa was transported in barrels by trucks and tankers to the Auckland factory, where Lemon &amp; Paeroa was made. It took until 1934 for the Lemon &amp; Paeroa label design to be trademarked, although the name itself was not trademarked at the time. This was because place names (Paeroa) and generic fruit are often not trademarkable. In 1934 L&amp;P started to be manufactured in the Paeroa factory. In 1960 the company was bought by New Zealand Breweries Ltd, which was later acquired by Schweppes. In 1963 Menzies &amp; Co merged with Hamilton-based bottlers CL Innes, and L&amp;P took on the &quot;Innes Tartan&quot; as a motif on the neck of the L&amp;P bottle. In the 1960s the well of the spring was lined with concrete that went deep, and in 1970 a pipeline was laid from the well to the factory. Due to the carbon dioxide from the well causing breathing issues for workers, there was difficulty upgrading it. The crane first chosen for these upgrades could not lift as much weight as required, meaning that a new crane had to be used. In 1969 Lemon &amp; Paeroa won the British Bottlers&#x27; Institute Diploma of Excellence Award, the only non-British company to do so. Innes Tartan and Schweppes was acquired by Oasis Industries in the late 1970s, who were later bought by Coca Cola in 1989.

In the 1970s the Paeroa factory was upgraded, increasing the floor space to . Around this time, a new spring water pipe was placed between the Paeroa factory and the Railway Reserve, which pumped filtered Paeroa spring water, allowing the public to drink the spring&#x27;s water for free by using a hand pump in a kiosk. It was smashed multiple times by vandals, causing the system&#x27;s closure eighteen months later. By the 1970s, water used in Lemon &amp; Paeroa was made artificially rather than coming from the spring. To make sure that the artificial water tastes the same as the original, checks were made between the artificial and spring water. In July 1980 the factory in Paeroa closed. L &amp; P production shifted to Auckland, and the drink is now manufactured by Coca-Cola.

In 1995 a complaint was made under the Fair Trading Act to the Commerce Commission, stating that as the water used in the drink now comes from Auckland rather than the Paeroa spring, it should renamed to Lemon &amp; Panmure (Panmure is the current location of the water supply), or production moved back to Paeroa. The Commerce Commission said that no action was necessary.

== Branding and packaging ==

In 1982–1983, two-litre bottles were released for L&amp;P, up from the previous maximum of 1.25 litres.

The brand was redesigned in 2005, changing the label to a &quot;retro&quot; style. After advertising marking the rebrand, the new branding was rolled out three months later in stores so that people would recognise the new bottle designs. In 2012 the branding was redesigned by Dow Design with the intention of making it look more up to date and in line with the younger generation. This included changing the cream coloured lid to a yellow one. The branding was changed again in 2016. It included a logo change and new bottle shapes, allowing for better differentiation of the various L&amp;P flavours.

In 2022 Coca-Cola announced that they were considering changing the plastic on the bottles from brown to clear, which would make recycling of the bottle easier. A similar change had already been made with Sprite bottles. Critics including Hauraki District Mayor Toby Adams have mentioned that because the brown bottle is iconic, people may have a hard time supporting the change. Adams said that if the reason of change (recycling) was given to consumers, they would be more likely to accept it. When asked if he thought the colour change would affect tourist numbers to the L&amp;P statue in Paeroa, Adams said he believed tourists are attracted to it because it is a large and famous bottle, not because of its colour.

=== Summer cans ===
The summer cans released in October 2018 had a spelling mistake. It spelt &quot;Cook Straight&quot; rather than the correct spelling, &quot;Cook Strait&quot;. After the first production run the typo was discovered and corrected. Lemon &amp; Paeroa decided to release these cans instead of throwing them away. Head of marketing at University of Auckland, Bodo Lang and brand strategist of University of Waikato, Korey Rubenstein have expressed the possibility that this was a deliberate marketing move rather than a mistake.

The 2023 edition, the eighth year of the summer cans, was the first year that the cans included both English and Māori words.

== Flavours and variations ==
A sugar-free version of L&amp;P was introduced in 2005, dry ginger beer was introduced in 2009, and sour in 2013. In October 2016 Lemon &amp; Paeroa launched a limited edition Chilli &amp; Lime flavour with stereotypical Mexican branding. It was described by the company as &quot;Like getting kicked by a baby donkey&quot;. To introduce this flavour an unscripted &quot;L&amp;P Live&quot; show was created, which was set in a dairy and hosted by comedians Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery.

There have been multiple L&amp;P fusion foods, such as a Whittaker&#x27;s chocolate in 2013, Griffin&#x27;s L&amp;P biscuit around 2017, L&amp;P Fruju in the summer of 2017, and a Pineapple lumps-flavoured drink for three months in 2020.

In 2019 Lemon &amp; Paeroa created a limited edition set of bottles which were tall. Ten of these bottles were made, and one sold on Trade Me for over $1,000.

== Attractions ==

=== Big Lemon &amp; Paeroa bottle ===
There is a tall L&amp;P bottle in Paeroa. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most famous icons, and one of the most photographed locations in the country. It began in 1967 as a replica rocket in the centre of town for a Christmas promotion of Paeroa, which was taken down after the summer. Materials from the rocket were used to create the Lemon &amp; Paeroa bottle for the 1968 Christmas season, but the bottle was dismantled after the summer as it became a traffic hazard. It was rebuilt in 1969, this time permanently, further away from the town centre near State Highway 2. The bottle became a traffic hazard again due to photographers, so in 2002 it was moved 20 m away to the Ohinemuri Reserve. The move took 40 minutes and was watched by about 100 residents. Since then, a park has been built around the statue.

In 2013 after Lemon &amp; Paeroa partnered with Whittaker&#x27;s to make an L&amp;P chocolate, a Whittaker&#x27;s delivery van was placed next to the statue to make it appear as if the van had crashed into it. Chief executive of the council, Langley Cavers, ordered that Whittaker&#x27;s pay for damage of the crash. It was reported that the mayor and council knew about the campaign and were told by Whittaker&#x27;s to &quot;play dumb&quot;.

=== Lemon &amp; Paeroa Café ===
Lemon &amp; Paeroa&#x27;s brand team operates a café, which was opened on 16 December 2000. It sells food flavoured with L&amp;P, which includes L&amp;P flavoured ice-cream, eggs benedict with L&amp;P hollandaise sauce, L&amp;P pork ribs, and L&amp;P chicken salad. Outside the café is a tall L&amp;P bottle outside, which is not to be confused with the tall bottle in the Ohinemuri Reserve. Having two L&amp;P bottle statues in Paeroa has caused controversy. The café also has a souvenir shop. In 2015 the café was refurbished. It was listed for sale in 2018, and 2020.

== Marketing ==
An instrumental piece written for a Lemon &amp; Paeroa advertisement won the writer, Mike Harvey, the Clio Award in 1978 for the best musical soundtrack in a commercial. In late 1987, a promotional music video for Lemon &amp; Paeroa was made by prominent music artists under the name &quot;80 in the Shade&quot;. It is based on the 1960s Motown song &quot;Heatwave&quot;, and the video was filmed in an L&amp;P factory. In 1988 it was named the country&#x27;s best commercial in the Listener Film and Television Awards. A long-running 1990s television advertisement for Lemon &amp; Paeroa, featuring the Swingers song &quot;Counting the Beat&quot; and the slogan &quot;World famous in New Zealand&quot;, was shot at various locations around Paeroa including the Lemon &amp; Paeroa statue. Starting in the early 2000s, there was an advertising campaign encouraging people to not get caught drinking anything other than L&amp;P. In the two years that this campaign ran, sales grew by 30%, which was higher than the soft drink industry overall.

At the time of the 2005 rebranding there was a $1.25 million advertising campaign that started on 27 February which changed the slogan from &quot;World famous in New Zealand&quot; to &quot;World famous in New Zealand since ages ago&quot;. The campaign mocked cringeworthy parts of the recent past, featuring 1970s and 1980s imagery such as stubbies, speedos, and the phrase &quot;bring back the mullet&quot;. The campaign started three months before new bottles were introduced in stores so that people would recognise the new branding.

In 2014 Lemon &amp; Paeroa created a &quot;3D pop-out billboard&quot; in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. The billboards had free gifts which could be detached, such as sandals, jandals, and towels. A Snapchat campaign took place in 2015, titled the &quot;Trickshot Challenge&quot;. People would buy a limited edition can labelled with &quot;Shot Bro Trickshot Challenge&quot;, which had one of four unique instructions showing how to use the can to perform a trickshot. Contestants would then tag Lemon &amp; Paeroa on Snapchat.

Lemon &amp; Paeroa launched a non-TV &quot;Backyard Cricket&quot; campaign. It featured friends and family playing cricket using unconventional gear, such as beer crates as wickets and tennis balls for bowling. The campaign creative said that the goal of the advertisements was to align Lemon &amp; Paeroa with New Zealand pastimes, and that &quot;backyard cricket is something every Kiwi can relate to&quot;. Similar use of local icons was used again in a 2017 campaign. It was named &quot;On the lamb&quot;, where sheep drank Lemon &amp; Paeroa, escaped the paddock, and then participated in iconic small town New Zealand pastimes such as playing arcade games, visiting the local Four Square, and having a swim at the beach, before returning back to a Māori farmer.

Lemon &amp; Paeroa launched an advertisement in 2019 that featured zombies in a post-apocalyptic city. The Advertising Standards Authority had received 40 complaints about the advertisement by November 2019. Complainants described it as &quot;frightening&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, and some complained that the advertisement had inappropriate timing, running before 7pm. The Authority did not uphold the complaints, but the advertisement was later rescheduled to play after 7pm.

In 2021 Lemon &amp; Paeroa launched a campaign named &quot;Space Manu&quot;. It started with a man in space, dressed in a space suit, who jumps from a platform to free fall to the ground, stripping down to his shorts, and eventually landing in a pool where he does a cannonball dive or manu. In 2023 Lemon &amp; Paeroa started &quot;Manu Applied Sciences Aotearoa&quot; (MASA) which had a logo with similar appearance to the one of NASA. A manu L&amp;P swimsuit was created, featuring an advertisement in outer space. The creative director of the campaign said that it was inspired by comments on their 2021 space advertisement. The swimsuit was made to be practical for doing the manu.

=== &quot;World Famous in New Zealand&quot; ===

The &quot;World Famous in New Zealand&quot; slogan was created in 1993 by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for Lemon and Paeroa. The lead creative of the campaign said that the campaign was &quot;very refreshing at a time when lots of brands were striving to mimic overseas trends. It was one of the first campaigns to truly embrace Kiwi quirks instead of shying away from them&quot;. The advertising campaign where the phrase was used would playfully mock aspects of Paeroa, such as by saying &quot;it ain&#x27;t famous for its [surf, Hollywood mansions, harbour bridge]&quot;. The advertisement then cut to a group of people in a car in front of the Lemon &amp; Paeroa bottle statue, and described Paeroa with &quot;But, it is famous!&quot;. The advertisement ran for over a decade, and was perceived as a classic. Now the phrase has entered everyday speech, referring to objects that are loved by locals.

In 2005, it was temporarily changed to &quot;World famous in New Zealand since ages ago&quot;.

The slogan was trademarked in 2004. Beginning in 2007, Tony Coombe tried to repeal Coca-Cola Amatil&#x27;s attempt to trademark it. Coombe himself owned a non-trading company named World Famous in New Zealand. He said that the main reason for his battle is that the phrase is a popular &quot;kiwi-ism&quot;, a popular part of New Zealand language, that belongs to New Zealanders. A legal argument used was that there had been several non-L&amp;P products with the name, and that people who use the phrase often do not reference L&amp;P. This was ultimately dismissed by the High Court. In a hearing in December 2009, Brian Jones, assistant commissioner of trademarks, said that L&amp;P had used the phrase since 1993, and later decided in favour of Coca Cola. By May 2010, Coombes had spent a total of $30,000 on legal fees.

<doc id="713455" wikidata="Q6815700" url="?curid=713455" title="Memory augmentation">
<text>Memory augmentation is the process by which one&#x27;s ability to retain information is increased. The retrieval of memory has been theorized to be untrustworthy, and it can be partially inaccurate and not totally reliable (see more: Recovered memory.) Ubiquitous Memory Systems have been invented in order to reduce these memory mistakes. A study conducted by students of the Information Science Department in Nara, Japan sought to measure different types of memory augmentation. They used a computer system, the &quot;Ubiquitous Memories,&quot; to demonstrate if the technology aided to augmentation better than other methods such as notes with a pen and paper, portraits used in a previous trial experiment, and just plain human memory. The results were that the Ubiquitous Memories aided in retrieving memory, and decreased the likelihood of mistakes in comparison to other methods.

Some researchers have even gone so far as to create mixed-reality simulations to assist individuals in improving their memories. Many of these systems implement the method of loci which involves using the spatial layout of a familiar place to help individuals remember certain things. For example, one might attempt to remember a packing list for a trip by imagining the items around their room.

Memory augmentation not only refers to our ability to recall information accurately, it also refers to our ability to encode long-term information quickly. Some researchers suggest that through using augmented reality interfaces, we have the ability to memorize information and store it in our long-term memory after only being exposed to it once. Specifically, the function of these interfaces is to stimulate parts of the brain that are essential to memory such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and entorhinal cortex which would result in the acquisition of episodic memory for things we would normally use long-term semantic memory to recall.

== Approaches to human memory ==
The traditional approach to memory is often what most people think of when they consider memory functions. This describes the instances in which individuals rely on areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, to function properly in order to maximize memory. However, the situated approach relies on external memory aids and environmental cues.

Another approach to human memory augmentation is using devices such as cell phones to capture videos and pictures of various life events and experiences. These pictures and videos can serve as retrieval cues for not only that particular instance but also for other memories associated with the time the picture or video was taken. In addition to this, it is suggested that keeping journal entries of important life events, writing to-do lists, and keeping an updated calendar can all assist in augmenting memory. Researchers have recently been studying the concept of lifelogging, which refers to the ability to continuously film one’s life through wearable cameras. This would increase the human capacity to remember events correctly because it would allow the individual to go back and replay parts of their life that they have forgotten.

When it comes to visual memory, some researchers believe that it is possible to know what someone is paying attention to, and therefore to know what they will remember simply by tracking what they are looking at. In other words, when an individual is not looking at something, they are not paying attention and therefore will be less likely to remember what they were not looking at.

== Memory augmentation and aging ==
Memory augmentation techniques can vary in effectiveness between age groups. Children tend to have an easier time learning and remembering new information, while older adults often have a more difficult time learning new information. Because there is often a decline in memory abilities as individuals age, the traditional approach to memory is not always most effective. Rather, external environmental cues have been found to be more effective when it comes to memory augmentation of the elderly. Researchers have also suggested that in order to improve the memory augmentation of older adults, the pace at which the individual learns may need to be slowed down in order to allow for them to fully process the information being presented. In addition to this, it is suggested that learners should be vigilant about organizing their learning materials. This could include creating a tidy learning environment as well. Imagery techniques such as using the method of loci for example also assists in the augmentation of memory in older adults. In addition to this, mnemonics can be used to remember lists of items. It is also important for older adults to learn in supportive environments that encourage them to try their best while not subjecting them to unnecessary pressure to remember. As with individuals of any age, if there is a high amount of pressure to remember certain concepts or items in a list, the individual will have a more difficult time remembering them. It is also essential for older adults to know what types of memory changes are and are not normal as they age.

== Memory improvement strategies ==
There are four different strategies many individuals use to improve and augment their long-term memories, which are:

1.    Nootropics: substances which can be consumed in an attempt to enhance memory encoding as well as retrieval. Nootropics are typically prescription medications such as Ritalin and Adderall which are used to treat various disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Any type of substance which includes any form of psychoactive compounds can also be considered a nootropic. For example, the compounds found in energy drinks such as caffeine and taurine have also been shown to improve cognitive functioning, and in turn, improve memory.

2.    Brain stimulation: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to stimulate certain brain regions associated with memory in a non-invasive way. This causes those areas to be more activated than other areas of the brain when an individual is trying to remember something. This, however, requires special equipment only accessible in a laboratory and therefore cannot be used at home.

3.    Mnemonics: commonly used memory techniques which involve strategies such as repetition, creating memorable phrases or words with the first letter of every word one wants to remember, using visual imagery, or creating a story involving the things which are necessary to remember.

4.    External aids: memory technique that involves writing down what one wants to remember. Making lists and reminders to ourselves often can be beneficial in enhancing our abilities to remember more items for longer periods of time.

==Ubiquitous memories system==

The Ubiquitous memories system contains two advantages:

# &quot;Cognitive design&quot; (vs. subliminal vs. rehearsal): It is a new design in the system to recover problems. Cognitive design was demonstrated in a study conducted by DeVaul et al. The user can operate the cognitive load by him/her self to arrange his/her memories in both controllable conscious and unconscious cognitive traits. This design recover the problems in subliminal and rehearsal operation that memory augmentation will be hard to obtain when the user is over-supported by the operations.
# &quot;Touching operation:&quot; Physically touching objects rather than simply looking at them can better aid an individual’s memory of that object because he or she now has tactile experience with it.

In order to select an object, the system must detect the object under the two conditions: 1:Dense/dust-covered object; a dense object is an object that is one of thickly gathered objects or one of piled object; a dust- covered object represents an object is not used often.

&quot;6 Procedures illustrate the Ubiquitous memories system:&quot;

# A user perceives an event via his/her body.
# The perceived event is stored into his/her brain as a memory.
# The human body is used as media for propagating memories.
# The transferred memory remains in the object.
# He/she transfers the memory from the object to his/her body when interested in the object and then touches the object again.
# He/she can recall the event.

<doc id="713467" wikidata="Q5003608" url="?curid=713467" title="Buzzy Bee">
<text>The Buzzy Bee is a popular toy in New Zealand. It resembles a bee with rotating wings that move and make a clicking noise while the toy is pulled along the ground. Possibly based on another earlier concept, it was designed and first produced in Newton, Auckland in the 1930s, by Maurice Schlesinger. It became popular during the post-war baby boom. Its bright colours and clicking sound call are familiar to many New Zealanders, making it one of the most well-recognised items of Kiwiana. Since this time however, the Buzzy Bee has branched out into various merchandise including books, puzzle and clothing.

==Promotion==

It received a good deal of free promotion with the visit of The Prince and Princess of Wales in 1983 with their infant son, Prince William of Wales, who played with a Buzzy Bee.

As an iconic New Zealand symbol, the Buzzy Bee caricature was used on the keel of NZL84, one of Emirates Team New Zealand&#x27;s entrant yachts for the America&#x27;s Cup held in Valencia, Spain, in 2007.

==Adaptations==
In June 2007, plans were unveiled for a Buzzy Bee stage show &quot;Buzzy Bee&#x27;s Big Day Out&quot;. The company behind the show also revealed that they had made an animated show reel and were finalising details of a distribution deal, and that they hoped to begin work on an animated series for television. 

An animated TV show, &quot;Buzzy Bee and Friends&quot;, premiered on TV2 in 2009. 52 episodes were produced.

<text>Paul Busti (8 October 1749 – 23 July 1824) was the &quot;Agent General&quot; (chief operating officer) of the Holland Land Company from 1799 until his death in 1824. As administrator of the Holland Land Company, Busti was responsible for the economic, political, and social development of large areas of central and western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. 

Busti was also known as &quot;Paulus Busti&quot; and &quot;Paolo Busti&quot;.

==Early life==

Busti was born in Monza (Italy). He was the son of Giulio Cesare Busti, a Milanese banker, and Marianna Zappa and was baptized &quot;Pauolo Ignatio Gerardo Maria Busti&quot;. Busti grew up in Milan and received a &quot;liberal education&quot; during the Italian Enlightenment led by Cesare Beccaria, Paolo Frisi and Roger Boscovich and the culture of &quot;Il Caffè&quot;. Busti spoke and wrote in several languages.

==Career==

From 1771, he was sent to Amsterdam, working in his uncle&#x27;s counting house. He lived at Herengracht 455 (Golden Bend) and 619. (In 1796 the Bolongaro Simonetta Company liquidated.) In 1797 he moved to the United States.

Busti was named &quot;Agent General&quot; of the Holland Land Company following the departure of Theophilus Cazenove in 1799. Busti supervised resident land agents located in Barneveld, New York, Cazenovia, New York, Batavia, New York and Meadville, Pennsylvania. Busti approved the establishment by Joseph Ellicott of the Holland Land Company Office in Batavia, New York, In 1802 Harm Jan Huidekoper transferred to Philadelphia to become his assistant. Busti dealt with Robert Morris (financier), Aaron Burr, John Dunlap and Alexander Hamilton (the treasurer). Busti kept a diary and as a farmer he made notes about improving agriculture, and the weather. Twice Busti visited Western New York during his twenty-four years as leadership. There he met with Francois Adriaan van der Kemp, and John Lincklaen.

==Personal life==

Busti married Elisabeth May, the daughter of John May, Jr. and Martha Naudin in 1794 in the English Episcopal Church in Amsterdam. The May family were of English origin and her father, uncle and grandfather were shipwrights, contractors, and suppliers for the Admiralty of Amsterdam. The Naudin family were merchants of French descent. Elisabeth&#x27;s older sister, Martha May, was married to Isaak ten Cate, one of the Holland Land Company investors. Busti was predeceased by his wife in 1822 and died on 23 July 1824 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both are buried in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
The Town of Busti, New York and the hamlet of Busti in Chautauqua County are named after him. There is also a Busti Avenue in Buffalo, New York, and the Paolo Busti Cultural Foundation in Batavia, New York.

<doc id="713491" wikidata="Q1267167" url="?curid=713491" title="Five stages of grief">
<text>According to the model of the five stages of grief, or the Kübler-Ross model, those experiencing sudden grief following an abrupt realization (shock) go through five emotions: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. 

Critics of the model have warned against using it too literally.

Introduced as &quot;The Five Stages of Death&quot; by Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in 1969, this model has been known by various names, including &quot;The Five Stages of Loss&quot;, &quot;The Kübler-Ross Model&quot;, the &quot;Kübler-Ross Grief Cycle&quot;, the &quot;Grief Cycle&quot;, &quot;The Seven Stages of Grief&quot;, and the &quot;Kübler-Ross Change Curve&quot;.

==History==
The model was introduced by Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients. Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the University of Chicago&#x27;s medical school. Kübler-Ross&#x27;s project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research, became the foundation for her book. Although Kübler-Ross is commonly credited with creating stage models, earlier bereavement theorists and clinicians such as Erich Lindemann, Collin Murray Parkes, and John Bowlby used similar models of stages or phases as early as the 1940s. In the foreword to the first 1970 English edition of &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;, Colin Murray Parkes wrote, &#x27;This book describes how some American individuals have coped with death.&#x27;

In her book, Kübler-Ross states that the medical advancements of the time were the mark of change for the way people perceive and experience death. Due to this, pediatricians have been seeing fewer life-threatening ailments for their patients compared to one-hundred years ago.

In her 1974 book &quot;Questions and Answers on Death and Dying&quot;, Kübler-Ross had by then observed that the stages are not experienced in a strictly linear progression. She noted, &#x27;Most of my patients have exhibited two or three stages simultaneously, and these do not always occur in the same order.&#x27; She later regretted writing them in a way that was misunderstood. &quot;Kübler-Ross originally saw these stages as reflecting how people cope with illness and dying,&quot; observed grief researcher Kenneth J. Doka, &quot;not as reflections of how people grieve.&quot; In the 1980s, the Five Stages of Grief evolved into the Kübler-Ross Change Curve, which is now widely utilized by companies to navigate and manage organizational change and loss. 

As of 2019, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; has been translated into forty-one languages, with the 50th anniversary edition published by Simon &amp; Schuster. In December 2019, &quot;The American Journal of Bioethics&quot; published a special issue (Volume 19, Number 12) dedicated to commemorating the 50th anniversary of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross&#x27;s work, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;.

== Stages of grief ==

Kübler-Ross originally developed stages to describe the process patients with terminal illness go through as they come to terms with their own deaths; it was later applied to grieving friends and family as well, who seemed to undergo a similar process. The stages, popularly known by the acronym DABDA, include:
# Denial – The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the precipitating event is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality. Some may also isolate themselves, avoiding others who may have accepted what is happening. This stage is usually a temporary defense, so long as the person has adequate time to move amongst the stages as they contemplate death. In her book, Kübler-Ross states that technological advancements have caused people to become fearful of violent, painful deaths; therefore, in order to protect the psychological mind, they deny the reality of their own inevitable death.
# Anger – When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: &quot;Why me? It&#x27;s not fair!&quot;; &quot;How can this happen to me?&quot;; &quot;Who is to blame?&quot;; &quot;Why would this happen?&quot;. Some may lash out at loved ones, medical staff, and other family. In Kübler-Ross&#x27;s other book, &quot;Questions and Answers on Death and Dying,&quot; she emphasizes the need for people to do their best to let those who are in this stage feel their feelings and try not to take the anger personally.
# Bargaining – The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise. Examples include the terminally ill person who &quot;negotiates with God&quot; to attend a daughter&#x27;s wedding, an attempt to bargain for more time to live in exchange for a reformed lifestyle or a phrase such as &quot;If I could trade their life for mine&quot;.
# Depression – &quot;I&#x27;m so sad, why bother with anything?&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m going to die soon, so what&#x27;s the point?&quot;; &quot;I miss my loved one; why go on?&quot;During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen.
# Acceptance – &quot;It&#x27;s going to be okay.&quot;; &quot;I can&#x27;t fight it; I may as well prepare for it.&quot; In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.
Kübler-Ross identified additional stages of emotional response beyond the five widely recognized stages of grief, illustrated in a full-page graphic on page 251 of the 50th anniversary edition of &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;. Alongside the well-known stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, Kübler-Ross detailed other &quot;stages&quot; such as shock, partial denial, preparatory grief (also known as anticipatory grief), hope, and decathexis, which refers to the process of withdrawing emotional investment from external objects or relationships. She also acknowledged other emotional responses including guilt, anxiety, and numbness.

In &quot;Questions and Answers on Death and Dying,&quot; Kübler-Ross answered questions after the publication of her first book, &quot;On Death and Dying.&quot; She emphasized that no patient should be directly told that they are dying and that practitioners should try to wait until the patient asks about death to discuss it. In her book, she also proposes that practitioners listen to the patient first and foremost, and that the patient&#x27;s right to self-determination should still be practiced.

In a posthumously published book co-authored with David Kessler, Kübler-Ross expanded the model to address a wide range of personal losses, recognizing that it might be more about change than solely about grief. This broader framework, more commonly known as the Kübler-Ross Change Curve, encompasses various forms of loss, including the death of a loved one, job or income loss, major rejection, relationship breakups or divorce, drug addiction, the onset of illness or infertility, and even minor setbacks like losing insurance coverage.. Kessler has also proposed &quot;Meaning&quot; as a sixth stage of grief. Other authors have also explored and expanded upon stage theories, such as Claire Bidwell Smith in her book &quot;Anxiety: The Missing Stage of Grief&quot;, which addresses additional aspects of emotional response and adjustment beyond Kübler-Ross’s original framework.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kessler applied the five stages to responses to the virus, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s not a map but it provides some scaffolding for this unknown world.&quot;

&quot;There&#x27;s denial, which we saw a lot of early on: &quot;This virus won&#x27;t affect us.&quot; There&#x27;s anger: &quot;You&#x27;re making me stay home and taking away my activities.&quot; There&#x27;s bargaining: &quot;Okay, if I social distance for two weeks everything will be better, right?&quot; There&#x27;s sadness: &quot;I don&#x27;t know when this will end.&quot; And finally there&#x27;s acceptance. &quot;This is happening; I have to figure out how to proceed.&quot;

Acceptance, as you might imagine, is where the power lies. We find control in acceptance. &quot;I can wash my hands. I can keep a safe distance. I can learn how to work virtually&quot;.&quot; 

==Criticism==
Criticisms of this five-stage model of grief center mainly on a lack of empirical research and empirical evidence supporting the stages as described by Kübler-Ross and, to the contrary, empirical support for other modes of the expression of grief. Moreover, it was suggested that Kübler-Ross&#x27; model is the product of a particular culture at a particular time and might not be applicable to people of other cultures. These viewpoints have been expressed by many experts, including Robert J. Kastenbaum (1932–2013) who was a recognized expert in gerontology, aging, and death. In his writings, Kastenbaum raised the following points:
* The existence of these stages as such has not been demonstrated.
* No evidence has been presented that people actually do move from Stage 1 through Stage 5.
* The limitations of the method have not been acknowledged.
* The line is blurred between description and prescription.
* The resources, pressures, and characteristics of the immediate environment, which can make a tremendous difference, are not taken into account.

A widely cited 2003 study of bereaved individuals conducted by Maciejewski and colleagues at Yale University obtained some findings consistent with a five-stage hypothesis but others inconsistent with it. Several letters were also published in the same journal criticizing this research and arguing against the stage idea. It was pointed out, for example, that instead of &quot;acceptance&quot; being the final stage of grieving, the data actually showed it was the most frequently endorsed item at the first and every other time point measured; that cultural and geographical bias within the sample population was not controlled for; and that out of the total number of participants originally recruited for the study, nearly 40% were excluded from the analysis who did not fit the stage model. In subsequent work, Prigerson &amp; Maciejewski focused on acceptance (emotional and cognitive) and backed away from stages, writing that their earlier results &quot;might more accurately be described as &#x27;states&#x27; of grief.&quot;

George Bonanno, Professor of Clinical Psychology at Columbia University, in his book &quot;The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss&quot;, summarizes peer-reviewed research based on thousands of subjects over two decades and concludes that a natural psychological resilience is a principal component of grief and that there are no stages of grief to pass. Bonanno&#x27;s work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome.

Among social scientists, another criticism is a lack of theoretical underpinning. Because the stages arose from anecdotes and not underlying theoretical principles it contains conceptual confusion. For example, some people criticize that some stages represent emotions while others represent cognitive processes, as if the experience felt must discern one from another. Also, there is no rationale for arbitrary dividing lines between states. On the other hand, there are other theoretically based, scientific perspectives that better represent the course of grief and bereavement such as: trajectories approach, cognitive stress theory, meaning-making approach, psychosocial transition model, two-track model, dual process model, and the task model.

Misapplication can be harmful if it leads bereaved persons to feel that they are not coping appropriately or it can result in ineffective support by members of their social network and/or health care professionals. The stages were originally meant to be descriptive but over time became prescriptive. Some caregivers dealt with clients who were distressed that they did not experience the stages in &quot;the right order&quot; or failed to experience one or more of the stages of grief.

Criticism and lack of support in peer-reviewed research or objective clinical observation by some practitioners in the field has led to the labels of &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;fallacy&quot; in the notion that there are stages of grief. Nevertheless, the model&#x27;s use has persisted in popular news and entertainment media, and some professionals have stated their confidence in the veracity of the model.

Kübler-Ross acknowledged the variability and complexity of individual experiences, using the so-called &quot;stages&quot; of emotional responses as a framework to describe common patterns. She explicitly described these stages as a heuristic device, noting that they are categories artificially isolated for clarity, with the understanding that emotional responses are fluid and overlapping. In her book, Kübler-Ross repeatedly warned that these &quot;stages&quot; can overlap, occur simultaneously, or be missed altogether, and she even placed the term &quot;stages&quot; in inverted commas in the book’s diagrammatic representation to emphasize their tentative nature. The principal aim of &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; was to fundamentally reshape attitudes toward the experiences of dying patients by advocating for a more humane and patient-centered approach in medical practice and beyond, rather than merely defining the experience of dying in &quot;stages.&quot;

<doc id="713492" wikidata="Q5111364" url="?curid=713492" title="Christmas Hills, Victoria">
<text>Christmas Hills is a town in Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Christmas Hills recorded a population of 365 at the 2021 census.

Christmas Hills is located between Kangaroo Ground and Yarra Glen, along Eltham-Yarra Glen Road (&quot;State Route C726&quot;), north of the Yarra River, in the Dandenong Ranges. In 1904, the Australian Handbook described Christmas Hills as &quot;an excellent health resort&quot;.

The locality is very hilly, with One Tree Hill in the northwest rising to above sea level, and is home to several reserves, including One Tree Hill Reserve and Sugarloaf Reservoir Park, opened in 1980 and managed by Melbourne Water.

==History==
Christmas Hills owes its name to an emancipated convict and shepherd, David Christmas, who became lost on a grazing lease in the area in 1842, and was found after days of wandering at a rise which was subsequently named after him. The area was considered to have poor quality soil, although nearby settlers earned an income from chopping firewood in the sclerophyll forests.

Gold was discovered at One Tree Hill in 1859, fuelling a brief goldrush. Quartz reef operations ended in 1864, and alluvial mining continued until 1908.

The area grew considerably in the 1870s; at one point the town had two hotels, two schools, a post office and a Mechanics&#x27; Institute.

The Post Office opened on 10 December 1874 as Christmas Hill, was renamed in 1913, and closed in 1974.

In 1884, a primary school was built, and by 1912, when the railway from Heidelberg to Hurstbridge was built, the area had a population of 146 and had become a tourist destination, popular with Melburnians seeking &quot;clean air and an invigorating climate&quot;.

In 1893, 1939, 1962 and 2009, the area suffered from destructive bushfires.

==Present Day==
Christmas Hills today is a large area encompassing several districts.

===Christmas Hills township===
The Christmas Hills township consists of a cluster of homes, a public hall, a tennis court, a memorial park with a World War I monument and a fire brigade shed, erected after the 1939 bushfires. About to the west is Christmas Hills Primary School, first established in 1884, with an enrolment of 22 students in 2006. A mobile library service managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library visits the community, parked at the school regularly.

===Rob Roy===
&quot;Rob Roy&quot; () in the western part is used for a range of hill racing events by the MG Car Club of Victoria. It was first established in 1937 by motoring enthusiasts and the Light Car Club for hill-racing motorbikes and cars and was utilised as a venue well into the postwar years. Initially a dirt track, it was fully bitumenised in 1939. It was burnt out in 1962, and abandoned. The MGCC took out a lease on the property in 1992, and rebuilt all the facilities, running the first meeting of the &quot;modern era&quot; in February 1993.

===One Tree Hill===
&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (), a former mining area in northwestern Christmas Hills, is now a 143 hectare reserve managed by Parks Victoria. Its main features are Happy Valley Creek, which runs through the reserve, and the One Tree Hill in the northeast. According to the Land Conservation Council of Victoria, it has been assessed as &quot;being of State botanical significance for its ecological integrity and viability, rarity and representation of community types&quot;, and is home to 22 species assessed as regionally threatened, rare or restricted in the greater Melbourne area, including roosting colonies of large bent-wing bat and eastern horseshoe bat, and the powerful owl, brush-tailed phascogale and barking owl. The LCC reports that 79 bird, 24 mammal, 7 reptile and 7 frog species have been recorded in the reserve.

===Sugarloaf Reservoir===
Sugarloaf Reservoir () is a 440-hectare reservoir which has a total water capacity of 96,000 megalitres, and was developed in the late 1970s and completed in 1981. It is managed by Melbourne Water and supplies scheme water to Melbourne&#x27;s northern, western and inner suburbs. Sugarloaf is fed by the Maroondah Aqueduct and the Yarra River, and before entering the domestic water supply, water is treated at the Winneke Water Treatment Plant on the south bank of the reservoir to World Health Organization guidelines. The main dam is 89 m high and 1,050 m long.

Around the reservoir is the &quot;Sugarloaf Reservoir Park&quot;, which opened in 1982 and is managed by Parks Victoria. The park&#x27;s entrance, open during most daylight hours, is off Eltham-Yarra Glen Road. Barbecue and picnic facilities are available at Saddle Dam, south-east of the dam wall, and Ridge Park to the North. Several walking trails can be used with permission of Parks Victoria. Watercraft are only permitted to launch from the Sugarloaf Sailing Club on the north bank, and sail boards, keel boats and/or craft with cabins, cooking or toilet facilities are not permitted on the Reservoir. The area is home to eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas, wedge-tailed eagles, crimson rosellas and other wildlife including a population of deer. Vegetation ranges from grassland, having been cleared for agriculture in the decades prior to the reservoir&#x27;s construction, to dry forest.

==Transport==
The nearest public transport is by bus to Yarra Glen downhill to the east. Driving is a much more viable option, considering the time and distance taken to use public transport, and spread of the towns.

<doc id="713497" wikidata="Q6453712" url="?curid=713497" title="Wireless mesh network">
<text>A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It can also be a form of wireless ad hoc network.

A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes constantly or frequently move, the mesh spends more time updating routes than delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes
computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. Hence, this is a low-mobility centralized form of wireless ad hoc network. Also, because it sometimes relies on static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc network.

Mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones, and other wireless devices. Mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways, which may or may not be connected to the Internet. The coverage area of all radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud depends on the radio nodes working together to create a radio network. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with different wireless technologies including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology or protocol.

==History==
Wireless mesh radio networks were originally developed for military applications, such that every node could dynamically serve as a router for every other node. In that way, even in the event of a failure of some nodes, the remaining nodes could continue to communicate with each other, and, if necessary, serve as uplinks for the other nodes.

Early wireless mesh network nodes had a single half-duplex radio that, at any one instant, could either transmit or receive, but not both at the same time. This was accompanied by the development of shared mesh networks. This was subsequently superseded by more complex radio hardware that could receive packets from an upstream node and transmit packets to a downstream node simultaneously (on a different frequency or a different CDMA channel). This allowed the development of switched mesh networks. As the size, cost, and power requirements of radios declined further, nodes could be cost-effectively equipped with multiple radios. This, in turn, permitted each radio to handle a different function, for instance, one radio for client access, and another for backhaul services.

Work in this field has been aided by the use of game theory methods to analyze strategies for the allocation of resources and routing of packets.

==Features==

===Architecture===
Wireless mesh architecture is a first step towards providing cost effective and low mobility over a specific coverage area. Wireless mesh infrastructure is, in effect, a network of routers minus the cabling between nodes. It is built of peer radio devices that do not have to be cabled to a wired port like traditional WLAN access points (AP) do. Mesh infrastructure carries data over large distances by splitting the distance into a series of short hops. Intermediate nodes not only boost the signal, but cooperatively pass data from point A to point B by making forwarding decisions based on their knowledge of the network, i.e. perform routing by first deriving the topology of the network.

Wireless mesh networks is a relatively &quot;stable-topology&quot; network except for the occasional failure of nodes or addition of new nodes. The path of traffic, being aggregated from a large number of end users, changes infrequently. Practically all the traffic in an infrastructure mesh network is either forwarded to or from a gateway, while in wireless ad hoc networks or client mesh networks the traffic flows between arbitrary pairs of nodes.

If rate of mobility among nodes are high, i.e., link breaks happen frequently, wireless mesh networks start to break down and have low communication performance.

===Management===
This type of infrastructure can be decentralized (with no central server) or centrally managed (with a central server). Both are relatively inexpensive, and can be very reliable and resilient, as each node needs only transmit as far as the next node. Nodes act as routers to transmit data from nearby nodes to peers that are too far away to reach in a single hop, resulting in a network that can span larger distances. The topology of a mesh network must be relatively stable, i.e., not too much mobility. If one node drops out of the network, due to hardware failure or any other reason, its neighbors can quickly find another route using a routing protocol.

===Applications===
Mesh networks may involve either fixed or mobile devices. The solutions are as diverse as communication needs, for example in difficult environments such as emergency situations, tunnels, oil rigs, battlefield surveillance, high-speed mobile-video applications on board public transport, real-time racing-car telemetry, or self-organizing Internet access for communities. An important possible application for wireless mesh networks is VoIP. By using a quality of service scheme, the wireless mesh may support routing local telephone calls through the mesh. Most applications in wireless mesh networks are similar to those in wireless ad hoc networks.

Some current applications:
* U.S. military forces are now using wireless mesh networking to connect their computers, mainly ruggedized laptops, in field operations.
* Electric smart meters now being deployed on residences, transfer their readings from one to another and eventually to the central office for billing, without the need for human meter readers or the need to connect the meters with cables.
* The laptops in the One Laptop per Child program use wireless mesh networking to enable students to exchange files and get on the Internet even though they lack wired or cell phone or other physical connections in their area.
* Smart home devices such as Google Wi-Fi, Google Nest Wi-Fi, and Google OnHub support Wi-Fi mesh (i.e., Wi-Fi ad hoc) networking. Several manufacturers of Wi-Fi routers began offering mesh routers for home use in the mid-2010s.
* Some communications satellite constellations operate as a mesh network, with wireless links between adjacent satellites. Calls between two satellite phones are routed through the mesh, from one satellite to another across the constellation, without having to go through an earth station. This makes for a shorter travel distance for the signal, reducing latency, and also allows for the constellation to operate with far fewer earth stations than would be required for an equal number of traditional communications satellites. The Iridium satellite constellation, consists of 66 active satellites in a polar orbit and operates as a mesh network providing global coverage.

===Operation===
The principle is similar to the way packets travel around the wired Internet – data hops from one device to another until it eventually reaches its destination. Dynamic routing algorithms implemented in each device allow this to happen. To implement such dynamic routing protocols, each device needs to communicate routing information to other devices in the network. Each device then determines what to do with the data it receives – either pass it on to the next device or keep it, depending on the protocol. The routing algorithm used should attempt to always ensure that the data takes the most appropriate (fastest) route to its destination.

===Multi-radio mesh===
Multi-radio mesh refers to having different radios operating at different frequencies to interconnect nodes in a mesh. This means there is a unique frequency used for each wireless hop and thus a dedicated CSMA collision domain. With more radio bands, communication throughput is likely to increase as a result of more available communication channels. This is similar to providing dual or multiple radio paths to transmit and receive data.

===Research topics===
One of the more often cited papers on wireless mesh networks identified the following areas as open research problems in 2005:

; New modulation schemes
: To achieve higher transmission rate requires new wideband transmission schemes other than OFDM and UWB.
; Advanced antenna processing
: Advanced antenna processing including directional, smart and multiple antenna technologies is further investigated, since their complexity and cost are still too high for wide commercialization.
; Flexible spectrum management
: Tremendous efforts on research of frequency-agile techniques are being performed for increased efficiency.
; Cross-layer optimization
: Cross-layer research is a popular current research topic where information is shared between different communications layers to increase the knowledge and current state of the network. This could facilitate development of new and more efficient protocols. A joint protocol that addresses various design problems—routing, scheduling, channel assignment etc.—can achieve higher performance since these problems are strongly co-related. Note that careless cross-layer design can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend.
; Software-defined wireless networking
: Centralized, distributed, or hybrid? - In a new SDN architecture for WMNs is explored that eliminates the need for multi-hop flooding of route information and therefore enables WMNs to easily expand. The key idea is to split network control and data forwarding by using two separate frequency bands. The forwarding nodes and the SDN controller exchange link-state information and other network control signaling in one of the bands, while actual data forwarding takes place in the other band.
; Security
: A WMN can be seen as a group of nodes (clients or routers) that cooperate to provide connectivity. Such an open architecture, where clients serve as routers to forward data packets, is exposed to many types of attacks that can interrupt the whole network and cause denial of service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

==Examples==
A number of wireless community networks have been started as grassroots projects across the world at various points in time.

Other projects, often proprietary or tied to a single institution, are:
* ALOHAnet was first used in Hawaii in 1971 to connect the islands.
* Amateur radio operators began experimenting with VHF and later UHF digital communications networks in Canada in 1978 and the US in 1980. By 1984, the volunteer-operated Amateur Packet Radio Network (AMPRNet) of &#x27;digipeaters&#x27; spanned most of North America. The emerging network allowed a licensed operator using merely an early laptop computer such as TRS-80 Model 100 and compatible handheld FM transceiver operating in the 1.25-meter band or 2-meter band to accomplish wireless transcontinental digital communications. With the development of the Internet, portals into and out of other IP networks facilitated &#x27;tunnels&#x27; to reach packet networks in other parts of the world.
* In 1998–1999, a field implementation of a campus-wide wireless network using 802.11 WaveLAN 2.4 GHz wireless interface on several laptops was successfully completed. Several real applications, mobility and data transmissions were made.
* Mesh networks were useful for the military market because of the radio capability, and because not all military missions have frequently moving nodes. The Pentagon launched the DoD JTRS program in 1997, with an ambition to use software to control radio functions - such as frequency, bandwidth, modulation and security previously baked into the hardware. This approach would allow the DoD to build a family of radios with a common software core, capable of handling functions that were previously split among separate hardware-based radios: VHF voice radios for infantry units; UHF voice radios for air-to-air and ground-to-air communications; long-range HF radios for ships and ground troops; and a wideband radio capable of transmitting data at megabit speeds across a battlefield. However, JTRS program was shut down in 2012 by the US Army because the radios made by Boeing had a 75% failure rate.
* Amazon eero is a Wi-Fi mesh networking system designed for use in homes and small businesses.
* Google Home and Google Nest Wifi support Wi-Fi mesh networking.
* In rural Catalonia, Guifi.net was developed in 2004 as a response to the lack of broadband Internet, where commercial Internet providers weren&#x27;t providing a connection or a very poor one. Nowadays with more than 30,000 nodes it is only halfway a fully connected network, but following a peer to peer agreement it remained an open, free and neutral network with extensive redundancy.
* In 2004, TRW Inc. engineers from Carson, California, successfully tested a multi-node mesh wireless network using 802.11a/b/g radios on several high speed laptops running Linux, with new features such as route precedence and preemption capability, adding different priorities to traffic service class during packet scheduling and routing, and quality of service. Their work concluded that data rate can be greatly enhanced using MIMO technology at the radio front end to provide multiple spatial paths.
* Zigbee digital radios are incorporated into some consumer appliances, including battery-powered appliances. Zigbee radios spontaneously organize a mesh network, using specific routing algorithms; transmission and reception are synchronized. This means the radios can be off much of the time, and thus conserve power. Zigbee is for low power low bandwidth application scenarios.
* Thread is a consumer wireless networking protocol built on open standards and IPv6/6LoWPAN protocols. Thread&#x27;s features include a secure and reliable mesh network with no single point of failure, simple connectivity and low power. Thread networks are easy to set up and secure to use with banking-class encryption to close security holes that exist in other wireless protocols. In 2014 Google Inc&#x27;s Nest Labs announced a working group with the companies Samsung, ARM Holdings, Freescale, Silicon Labs, Big Ass Fans and the lock company Yale to promote Thread.
* In early 2007, the US-based firm Meraki launched a mini wireless mesh router. The 802.11 radio within the Meraki Mini has been optimized for long-distance communication, providing coverage over 250 metres. In contrast to multi-radio long-range mesh networks with tree-based topologies and their advantages in O(n) routing, the Maraki had only one radio, which it used for both client access and backhaul traffic. In 2012, Meraki was acquired by Cisco. 
* The Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey CA, demonstrated such wireless mesh networks for border security. In a pilot system, aerial cameras kept aloft by balloons relayed real time high resolution video to ground personnel via a mesh network.
* SPAWAR, a division of the US Navy, is prototyping and testing a scalable, secure Disruption Tolerant Mesh Network to protect strategic military assets, both stationary and mobile. Machine control applications, running on the mesh nodes, &quot;take over&quot;, when Internet connectivity is lost. Use cases include Internet of Things e.g. smart drone swarms.
* An MIT Media Lab project has developed the XO-1 laptop or &quot;OLPC&quot; (One Laptop per Child) which is intended for disadvantaged schools in developing nations and uses mesh networking (based on the IEEE 802.11s standard) to create a robust and inexpensive infrastructure. The instantaneous connections made by the laptops are claimed by the project to reduce the need for an external infrastructure such as the Internet to reach all areas, because a connected node could share the connection with nodes nearby. A similar concept has also been implemented by Greenpacket with its application called SONbuddy.
* In Cambridge, UK, on 3 June 2006, mesh networking was used at the “Strawberry Fair” to run mobile live television, radio and Internet services to an estimated 80,000 people.
* Broadband-Hamnet, a mesh networking project used in amateur radio, is &quot;a high-speed, self-discovering, self-configuring, fault-tolerant, wireless computer network&quot; with very low power consumption and a focus on emergency communication.
* The Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN) project is developing mesh networking software based on open source implementations of the Hazy-Sighted Link State Routing Protocol and Expected Transmission Count metric. Additionally, the Wireless Networking Group in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are developing a multichannel, multi-radio wireless mesh testbed, called Net-X as a proof of concept implementation of some of the multichannel protocols being developed in that group. The implementations are based on an architecture that allows some of the radios to switch channels to maintain network connectivity, and includes protocols for channel allocation and routing.
* FabFi is an open-source, city-scale, wireless mesh networking system originally developed in 2009 in Jalalabad, Afghanistan to provide high-speed Internet to parts of the city and designed for high performance across multiple hops. It is an inexpensive framework for sharing wireless Internet from a central provider across a town or city. A second larger implementation followed a year later near Nairobi, Kenya with a freemium pay model to support network growth. Both projects were undertaken by the Fablab users of the respective cities.
* SMesh is an 802.11 multi-hop wireless mesh network developed by the Distributed System and Networks Lab at Johns Hopkins University. A fast handoff scheme allows mobile clients to roam in the network without interruption in connectivity, a feature suitable for real-time applications, such as VoIP.
* Many mesh networks operate across multiple radio bands. For example, Firetide and Wave Relay mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 5.2 GHz or 5.8 GHz, but communicate node to client on 2.4 GHz (802.11). This is accomplished using software-defined radio (SDR).
* The SolarMESH project examined the potential of powering 802.11-based mesh networks using solar power and rechargeable batteries. Legacy 802.11 access points were found to be inadequate due to the requirement that they be continuously powered. The IEEE 802.11s standardization efforts are considering power save options, but solar-powered applications might involve single radio nodes where relay-link power saving will be inapplicable.
* The WING project (sponsored by the Italian Ministry of University and Research and led by CREATE-NET and Technion) developed a set of novel algorithms and protocols for enabling wireless mesh networks as the standard access architecture for next generation Internet. Particular focus has been given to interference and traffic-aware channel assignment, multi-radio/multi-interface support, and opportunistic scheduling and traffic aggregation in highly volatile environments.
* WiBACK Wireless Backhaul Technology has been developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems (FOKUS) in Berlin. Powered by solar cells and designed to support all existing wireless technologies, networks are due to be rolled out to several countries in sub-Saharan Africa in summer 2012.
* Recent standards for wired communications have also incorporated concepts from Mesh Networking. An example is ITU-T G.hn, a standard that specifies a high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). In noisy environments such as power lines (where signals can be heavily attenuated and corrupted by noise), it is common that mutual visibility between devices in a network is not complete. In those situations, one of the nodes has to act as a relay and forward messages between those nodes that cannot communicate directly, effectively creating a &quot;relaying&quot; network. In G.hn, relaying is performed at the data link layer.

<doc id="713509" wikidata="Q780517" url="?curid=713509" title="Speed garage">
<text>Speed garage (occasionally known as plus-8) is a genre of electronic dance music, associated with the UK garage scene, of which it is regarded as one of its subgenres.

==Characteristics==
Speed garage features sped-up NY garage 4-to-the-floor rhythms that are combined with breakbeats. Snares are placed as over the 2nd and the 4th kickdrums, so in other places of the drum pattern. Speed garage tunes have warped, heavy basslines, influenced by jungle and reggae. Sweeping bass is typical for speed garage. It is also typical for speed garage tunes to have a breakdown. Speed garage tunes sometimes featured time-stretched vocals. As it is heavily influenced by jungle, speed garage makes heavy use of jungle and dub sound effects, such as gunshots and sirens.

A widely regarded pioneer of the speed garage sound is record producer, DJ and remixer Armand van Helden, whose Dark Garage remix of the Sneaker Pimps&#x27; &quot;Spin Spin Sugar&quot; in 1996 helped bring the style of speed garage into the mainstream arena.

== Resurgence in the 2020s ==
In the early 2020s, speed garage experienced a notable resurgence within the UK music scene. This revival was marked by a renewed interest in the genre&#x27;s distinctive basslines and energetic rhythms, leading to a fresh wave of productions and chart successes.

A pivotal moment in this revival was the release of &quot;B.O.T.A. (Baddest of Them All)&quot; by Interplanetary Criminal and Eliza Rose in the summer of 2022. The track, featuring a Korg M1 organ bassline characteristic of speed garage, achieved the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart, underscoring the genre&#x27;s renewed popularity.

Interplanetary Criminal, a Manchester-based producer, has been instrumental in this resurgence. His work blends traditional speed garage elements with contemporary sounds, appealing to both longtime fans and new listeners. In April 2020, he released &quot;Pride (Speed Garage Mix)&quot;, which showcased his commitment to revitalising the genre.

Collaborations have also played a significant role in the genre&#x27;s revival. In November 2024, Interplanetary Criminal teamed up with Sammy Virji to release &quot;Damager&quot;, a track that fuses speed garage with donk influences, further highlighting the genre&#x27;s evolving sound.

This renewed interest in speed garage has been accompanied by a broader UK garage revival, with artists and producers drawing inspiration from the genre&#x27;s classic sounds while infusing them with modern production techniques. The resurgence has been evident in clubs, festivals, and charts, indicating a vibrant and enduring appreciation for speed garage in contemporary music culture.

==Notable songs/remixes==

<doc id="713529" wikidata="Q123811" url="?curid=713529" title="Elisabeth Kübler-Ross">
<text>Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (July 8, 1926 – August 24, 2004) was a Swiss-American psychiatrist, a pioneer in near-death studies, and author of the internationally best-selling book, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; (1969), where she first discussed her theory of the five stages of grief, also known as the &quot;Kübler-Ross model&quot;.

In 1970, Kübler-Ross delivered the Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard University, focusing on her book, &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;. By July 1982, Kübler-Ross had taught 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions. In 1999, the New York Public Library named &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; one of its &quot;Books of the Century,&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the &quot;100 Most Important Thinkers&quot; of the 20th century. Throughout her career, Kübler-Ross received over 100 awards, including twenty honorary degrees, and was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2024, Simon &amp; Schuster released a list of their 100 most notable books, including Kübler-Ross&#x27;s &quot;On Death &amp; Dying&quot;. Stanford University&#x27;s Green Library currently houses her remaining archives which are available for study.

==Early life and education==
Elisabeth Kübler was born on July 8, 1926, in Zürich, Switzerland, into a Protestant Christian Family. She was one of a set of triplets, two of whom were identical. Her life was jeopardized due to complications, weighing only 2 pounds at birth, but she said she survived due to her mother&#x27;s love and attentiveness. Elisabeth later contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized at age 5, during which she had her first experience with death as her roommate died peacefully. Her early experiences with death led her to believe that, because death is a necessary stage of life, one must be prepared to face it with dignity and peace.

During World War II, at only 13 years of age, Kübler-Ross worked as a laboratory assistant for refugees in Zürich. From a young age, she was determined to become a doctor despite her father&#x27;s efforts in forcing her to become a secretary for his business. She refused him and left home at 16. She began working as a housemaid for a mean woman, where she met a doctor who wished to help her in becoming a doctor. She then worked as an apprentice for a Dr. Braun, a scientist in her hometown, up until he went bankrupt. Here, she remembered getting her first lab coat with her name on it.

On May 8th, 1945, at the age of eighteen, she joined the International Voluntary Service for peace as an activist. Two days later, she crossed the border into France, leaving her home of Switzerland for the first time. Her first assignment was to help rebuild the French town of Ecurcey. For the next four years, she continued to do relief work in France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. 

In 1947, Kübler-Ross visited the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, an experience that profoundly affected her understanding of compassion and the resilience of the human spirit. The harrowing stories of survivors left an indelible mark on her, inspiring her life&#x27;s mission to assist and heal others. She was also profoundly affected by the images of hundreds of butterflies carved into some of the walls there. To Kübler-Ross, the butterflies—these final works of art by those children facing death—stayed with her for years and influenced her thinking about the end of life. Later that year, she briefly lived with Romani people near the Polish/Russian border town of Bialystok. During this period, she faced the imminent closure of borders by the Russians. She encountered American officers who assisted in her evacuation on a transport plane from Poland to Berlin.

After returning to Zürich, Kübler-Ross worked for a dermatologist named Dr. Kan Zehnder at the Canton Hospital an apprentice. After this time, she worked to support herself in a variety of jobs, gaining major experience in hospitals while volunteering to provide aid to refugees. Following this, she went on to attend the University of Zurich to study medicine, and graduated in 1957.

==Career==
===Academic career===

After graduating from the University of Zurich in 1957, Kübler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continue her studies.

She commenced her psychiatric residency in the Manhattan State Hospital on July 6, 1959, marking the beginning of her career working by creating her own treatments for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title &quot;hopeless patient&quot;, a term used at the time to reference terminal patients. These treatment programs would work to restore the patient&#x27;s sense of dignity and self-respect. Kübler-Ross also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world. During this time, Ross was horrified by the neglect and abuse of psychiatric patients as well as the imminently dying. She found that the patients were often treated with little care or completely ignored by the hospital staff. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals. She developed a program that focused on the individual care and attention for each patient. This program worked incredibly well, and resulted in significant improvement in the mental health of 94% of her patients.

In 1962, she accepted a position at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. There, Kübler-Ross worked as a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but she wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. She stated to her students:

Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now you&#x27;ll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to treat them with compassion – the same compassion that you would want for yourself

Kübler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional psychiatry that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical psychoanalysis training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Pritzker School of Medicine, where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar consisting of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.
By 1966, Kübler-Ross was giving regular weekly seminars on dying patients at her hospital. In late 1966, she wrote a seventeen-page article titled &quot;The Dying Patient as Teacher: An Experiment and an Experience&quot; for the December issue of &quot;The Chicago Theological Seminary Journal,&quot; which was themed &quot;On Death and Dying.&quot; Although she expressed concerns about her English proficiency, the editor reassured her. Despite the journal&#x27;s limited circulation, a copy of her article reached an editor at Macmillan Publishing Company in New York City. Consequently, on July 7, 1967, Macmillan offered Kübler-Ross a contract to expand her work into a 256-page book titled &quot;On Death &amp; Dying.&quot; Coincidentally, just six days later, on July 13, 1967, St. Christopher&#x27;s Hospice, the first modern hospice, admitted its inaugural patient. The book was officially registered with the US copyright office on May 19, 1969. Despite delays, the book was eventually published in November 1969 and quickly became a best-seller, profoundly altering her life. Notably, as of December 18, 1976, &quot;On Death &amp; Dying&quot; remained on the New York Times Best Seller list for trade paperbacks, listing at #3.

In November 1969, &quot;Life&quot; magazine ran an article on Kübler-Ross, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced Kübler-Ross&#x27;s decision to focus her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. Kübler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the &quot;greatest mystery in science&quot;—death.
During the 1970&#x27;s, Kübler-Ross became a champion of the worldwide hospice movement. She traveled to over twenty countries on six continents initiating various hospice and palliative care programs. In 1970, Kübler-Ross spoke at the prestigious Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard University on the subject of death and dying. On August 7, 1972, she spoke to the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging to promote the &quot;Death With Dignity&quot; movement. In 1977, she was named &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. In 1978, Kübler-Ross cofounded the American Holistic Medical Association.

===Healing center California===
Kübler-Ross was one of the central figures in the hospice care movement, believing that euthanasia prevents people from completing their &quot;unfinished business&quot;.

In 1977, she founded &quot;Shanti Nilaya&quot; (Home of Peace) on forty acres of land in Escondido, California. At this time, Kübler-Ross began conducting &quot;Life, Death, and Transition (LTD) workshops with the goal of assisting people to resolve their &quot;unfinished business&quot;, using Shanti Nilaya as a setting for some of these five-day workshops. She also intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the American Holistic Medical Association during this time period.

In the late 1970s, after interviewing thousands of patients who had died and been resuscitated, she became interested in out-of-body experiences, mediumship, spiritualism, and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by Jay Barham, founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could channel the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal &quot;entities&quot;, he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the &quot;spirits&quot;. He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose. Kubler-Ross&#x27; friend Deanna Edwards was invited to attend a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true. He was found to be naked and wearing only a turban when Edwards unexpectedly pulled masking tape off the light switch and flipped on the light. Despite the accusation of sexual misconduct Kübler-Ross defended him for over a year. The authorities did not press charges against the Barhams. Then she announced the ending of her association with both Jay Barham and his wife Martha in her &quot;Shanti Nilaya Newsletter&quot; (issue 7) on June 7, 1981.

===Investigations on near-death experiences===
Kübler-Ross also dealt with the phenomenon of near-death experience. She was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife, serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS).
Kübler-Ross reported her interviews with the dying for the first time in her book, &quot;On Death and Dying: What the Dying Have to Teach Doctors, Nurses, Clergy, and Their Own Families&quot; (1969). Originally, this book had a thirteenth chapter on near-death experiences but her colleagues strongly advised her to remove it for the sake of public acceptance, which she did before the book went to press.

In 1981, she appeared on an Australian radio documentary about death and near-death experiences that aired on the ABC, &quot;And When I Die, Will I Be Dead?&quot; It was adapted into a book in 1987.

Kübler-Ross went on to write several books about near-death experiences (NDEs). Her book &quot;On Life After Death&quot; (1991) was compiled from three lectures she gave:
*&quot;Leben und Sterben&quot; (Living and Dying), a speech she made in Switzerland in December 1982 in the German language.
*&quot;There is no Death&quot;, given in San Diego in 1977.
*&quot;Life, Death, and Life After Death&quot;, a recorded lecture she gave in 1980. 
The English language edition sold over 200,000 copies. The German Language edition also was a best seller with 100,000&#x27;s sold.

Another book, &quot;The Tunnel and The Light&quot; (1999), originally entitled &quot;Death is of Vital Importance&quot;, was also composed of various lectures she had previously given.

=== Life, Death, and Transition Workshops ===
In the late 1970s, Kübler-Ross developed a series of 5-day residential workshops aimed at helping individuals who were nearing the end of their lives to live more fully during their remaining time. These workshops were designed to accommodate not only the dying but also their caregivers, who were encouraged to participate in the sessions. The workshops provided a forum for patients to share their stories and express their fears, anger, and grief regarding their impending death. A recurring theme in the workshops was addressing regrets associated with perceived wasted time and energy related to unresolved childhood issues such as abuse and neglect. These unresolved issues often manifested as misplaced anger, perfectionism, controlling behavior, prioritization of material wealth over relationships, feelings of unworthiness, and a lack of meaning.

To address the intensity of these emotions, Dr. Kübler-Ross incorporated techniques to help participants externalize their emotions, including the release of buried rage, grief, and fear. This approach often facilitated a deeper understanding and resolution of long-standing pain, leading to a transformation of fear and grief into gratitude. Recognizing that caregivers also benefited from the workshops, Dr. Kübler-Ross opened the sessions to anyone seeking to live more fully until death.

A distinctive feature of the workshops was the use of impromptu crayon drawings, a technique influenced by the work of Jungian analyst Dr. Susan Bach. Dr. Kübler-Ross instructed participants on drawing interpretation to help uncover unconscious reasons for their attendance and to address past losses. Additionally, she presented a model of human development encompassing four parts— emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual—referred to as &quot;The Four Quadrants,&quot; which forms the basis of her work in the beginnings of the palliative care movement. She also addressed what she called &quot;the five core emotions&quot; —fear, anger, natural jealousy, grief, and love—and their natural expressions and distortions.

=== Work with children ===
Throughout her career, Kübler-Ross extensively studied and wrote about children&#x27;s perceptions of death. Her notable works include &quot;The Dougy Letter&quot; (1979), &quot;Living with Death and Dying&quot; (1981), and &quot;On Children and Dying&quot; (1983). These books explore how children understand, discuss, and respond to death, reflecting her insights into the unique ways children express their experiences and fears.

Kübler-Ross&#x27;s work was partly driven by requests from patients and readers seeking a deeper understanding of the language used by terminally ill children to articulate their needs. In &quot;Living with Death and Dying&quot; (1981), she argues that children have a more nuanced awareness of death than often assumed and are more willing to discuss it openly. 

Influenced by the work of Susan Bach and Gregg Furth, Kübler-Ross examined how children&#x27;s drawings serve as a crucial means of communication. She identified two distinct types of communication related to death in children. &quot;Nonverbal Symbolic Language&quot; is used by younger children, who may express their understanding of death through drawings, pictures, or objects, as they might lack the verbal skills to articulate their feelings directly. As children grow older, they may transition to &quot;Verbal Symbolic Language,&quot; characterized by complex stories and unusual questions that serve to express their emotions and concerns about death. Children may be fearful of asking direct questions regarding their death, so they may come up with stories or strange questions that will meet their needs. This form of communication reflects their evolving ability to articulate their feelings and fears, though they may still struggle with direct inquiries about death.

===AIDS work===
During a time when patients suffering from AIDS were being disowned and discriminated against for their illness, Kübler-Ross accepted them with open arms. She conducted many workshops on life, death, grief, and AIDS in different parts of the world, teaching about the disease and working to reduce the stigma surrounding it. Later, she created a workshop meant solely for patients who had contracted AIDS; even though the majority of people who contracted AIDS at that time were gay men, women and children also contracted the disease. This surprised her, as she had not expected just how many children and babies had contracted the terminal illness. She noted in her book that babies typically contracted the disease through the mother or father or through contaminated blood transfusions, also remarking that older children that had the disease may have contracted it due to sexual assault from someone who was HIV-seropositive.

=== Prison hospice ===
During this period, Kübler-Ross developed an interest in the concept of prison hospice care. In the mid-1980&#x27;s, the prison facility at Vacaville, California emerged as the primary site for delivering healthcare services to incarcerated individuals. In 1984, Kübler-Ross delegated one of her staff members, Irene Smith to conduct an investigative assessment of conditions at this institution. Subsequently, Kübler-Ross enlisted the aid of Nancy Jaicks Alexander, a workshop leader in Kübler-Ross&#x27; Life, Death, and Transition (LDT) workshops, to further explore avenues for enhancing end-of-life care for AIDS patients confined at the Vacaville facility. Nancy alongside her husband, Robert went on to co-found the first prison hospice in 1992. Concurrently, Kübler-Ross pursued additional prison-related initiatives in Hawaii, Ireland and Scotland throughout the 1980s. In June 1991, she held her first LDT workshop inside a prison at Edinburgh&#x27;s Saughton Prison (HM Prison).

One of her greatest wishes was to build a hospice for abandoned infants and children infected with HIV to give them a lasting home where they could live until their death. Kübler-Ross attempted to set this up in the late 1980s in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In October 1994, she lost her house and many possessions, including photos, journals, and notes, to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.

=== Legacy and contributions ===

Kübler-Ross changed the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice care, palliative care, bioethics, and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals&#x27; lives to the public eye. Kübler-Ross was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to &quot;treat the dying with dignity&quot;. Balfour Mount, the first palliative care physician in Canada and the person who coined the term &quot;palliative care&quot;, credits Kübler-Ross with sparking his interest in end-of-life care. Kübler-Ross wrote over 20 books on death and dying, which have been translated into 44 languages. At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring two books with David Kessler including &quot;On Grief and Grieving&quot; (2005). In 2018 Stanford University acquired the Kübler-Ross archives from her family and has started building a digital library of her papers, interviews and other archival material.

Following extensive work with dying patients, Kübler-Ross published &quot;On Death and Dying&quot; in 1969, in which she proposed the now famous &quot;five stages&quot; model as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. This model has since become widely accepted in academia and by the general public. In the graphic that was included in &quot;On Death &amp; Dying&quot;, Kübler-Ross mentions other emotions as being a part of this journey including: shock, partial denial, preparatory grief (anticipatory grief), hope, and decathexis.

The five-stage model has received some criticism by academics who argue against approaches that universally apply it to all bereaved groups or claim that grief should be expressed in a set number of rigidly linear stages. Kübler-Ross, with colleague David Kessler in &quot;On Grief and Grieving&quot;, cautioned that the stages &quot;are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of them or in a prescribed order.&quot; Dr. Allan Kellehear responded to the critics in the 40th anniversary edition&#x27;s introduction to &quot;On Death &amp; Dying&quot; the following, &quot;the so-called “stage theory” that you will read in this book is openly described and discussed as a heuristic device. In other words, these stages are merely a set of categories artificially isolated and separately described so that the author can discuss each of these experiences more clearly and simply. The careful reader will note Kübler-Ross’s own repeated warnings that many of these “stages” overlap, occur together, or even that some reactions are missed altogether. To emphasize this conditional way of taking about stages, the word “stages” was even put in inverted commas to emphasize their tentative nature in the only diagrammatic representation of these ideas in the book.&quot;

In the 1980&#x27;s, an increasing number of companies began using the five stages model to explain reactions to change and loss. This is now known as the &quot;Kübler-Ross Change Curve&quot; and is used by a variety of &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies in the US and internationally.

The Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation continues her work through a series of international chapters around the world. She received many awards and honors during her career, including honorary degrees from various universities, and is featured in a photograph exhibit at the Virginia headquarters of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. The &quot;American Journal of Bioethics&quot; devoted its entire December 2019 issue to the 50th anniversary of &quot;On Death and Dying&quot;. For instance, in his article &quot;Everything I Really Needed to Know to Be a Clinical Ethicist, I Learned From Elisabeth Kübler-Ross,&quot; American bioethicist Mark G. Kuczewski outlined how Kübler-Ross laid the foundation for clinical bioethics and emphasized the need to listen to patients for understanding their needs and improving their quality of life.

==Personal life==
In 1958, she married a fellow medical student and classmate from America, Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Ross, and moved to the United States. Together, they completed their internships at Long Island&#x27;s Glen Cove Community Hospital in New York. After they married, she had their first child in 1960, a son named Kenneth, and in 1963, a daughter named Barbara. The marriage dissolved in 1979. They remained friends until his death on December 9, 1992.

===Final years and death===

Kübler-Ross endured a sequence of strokes from 1987 to 1994, none of which imposed lasting physical limitations upon her. Following a Virginia house fire on October 6, 1994, and subsequent transient ischemic attack (TIA), she relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona. During this period, the Healing Waters Farm and the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Center ceased operations in Headwaters, Virginia. The following month, she acquired a residence in the desert near Carefree, Arizona. After suffering a larger stroke in May 1995, she found herself living in a wheelchair and wished to be able to determine her time of death.

In 1997, Oprah Winfrey flew to Arizona to interview Kübler-Ross and discuss with her whether she herself was going through the five stages of grief. July 2001 saw her traveling to Switzerland to celebrate her final birthday (her 75th) with her three triplet sisters. In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a &quot;damned procrastinator&quot;. From 2002 until August 2004, she was in a nursing home under hospice care, spending her final days there.

Kübler-Ross died with her two children at her side in Scottsdale on August 24, 2004, aged 78 of natural causes. She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Scottsdale.

In 2005 her son, Ken Ross, founded the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona. The trademark &#x27;Elisabeth Kübler-Ross,&#x27; along with all associated copyrights and other trademarks associated with Kübler-Ross, is managed and controlled by her children through the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Family Limited Partnership.

==In popular culture==
Since Kübler-Ross&#x27; death, many songs and albums have been named after her or dedicated to her. Songs such as &quot;Kübler-Ross&quot; have been named after her by artists including: Matthew B Everett (2008), Chuck Wilson (2010), Elephant Rifle (2010), Permute (2011), Taylor Whitelow of the Youth (2012), Dominic Moore (2015), Andy Jenkinson (2019)Alp Aybers (2020), Audio Medic (2021), O SIZE (2022), Kübler-Ross &quot;the band&quot; (2020), Norro (2024), and Mic Lanny &amp; James Rock (2014). In 2008 Matt Elliott release, &quot;The Kübler-Ross Model&quot; on his album, &quot;Howling Songs. &#x27;In 2006, The Gnomes released a song track titled “Elisabeth Kübler-Ross has Died.” Notably, the Oxford-based band Spring Offensive incorporated excerpts of Kübler-Ross&#x27;s voice three times in their 13:20-minute rock ballad &#x27;The First of Many Dreams About Monsters,&#x27; a 2010 song about grief, death, and the singer&#x27;s deceased mother.&quot;

In addition to songs, EP albums such as &quot;Kübler-Ross&quot; by Chine Drive (2023), &quot;Kübler-Ross Soliloquies&quot; album by Deadbeat (2023), &quot;Kübler-Ross&quot; album by Coachello (2024), and &quot;Kübler-Ross (Five Stages of Grief)&quot; album by Saint Juvi (2024) have been named in her remembrance. 

Several musical artists have also titled albums based on Kübler-Ross’s books, such as &quot;Beyond the Shores (On Death &amp; Dying)&quot; by Shores of Null (2020) and &quot;Wheel of Life&quot; by Japanese saxophonist Sadao Watanabe. Marina&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Love &amp; Fear&quot; draws inspiration from Kübler-Ross&#x27;s philosophy.

Kübler-Ross&#x27;s impact extends to band names as well, with KÜBLER ROSS, a Swedish punk band founded by a former nurse, and Kübler-Ross, a synth/wave/industrial band from Glasgow, Scotland, whose album &quot;Kübler-Ross&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year in Scotland in 2021. A South Korean math rock band named &quot;Dabda&quot;, an acronym representing the Five Stages of Grief, was formed in 2014.

Most of the valley is agricultural; however, the oceanside towns of Yamba and Iluka are popular holiday resorts.

The council was formed in February 2004 by the merger of the City of Grafton and Maclean Shire, and parts of Copmanhurst, Pristine Waters and Richmond Valley local government areas, and the activities of North Coast Water and Clarence River County Council.

<doc id="713540" wikidata="Q1994978" url="?curid=713540" title="Brainiac 5">
<text>Brainiac 5 (Querl Dox) is a superhero appearing in comics published by DC Comics. He is from the planet Colu and is a long-standing member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th and 31st centuries.

Brainiac 5 has been substantially adapted into other media, primarily in association with the Legion. He is voiced by Adam Wylie in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006) and portrayed by James Marsters and Jesse Rath in &quot;Smallville&quot; and the Arrowverse respectively. A gender-swapped alternate universe variant of Brainiac 5 appears in the fifth season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Rath&#x27;s sister Meaghan Rath.

==Publication history==
Brainiac 5 first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #276 (May 1961) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. He was originally written as a descendant of Superman&#x27;s enemy Brainiac. Several years later, when Brainiac was revealed to be a living computer, Brainiac 5 was retconned to be a descendant of his adopted son.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original continuity (1958–1994)===

Brainiac 5 is a teenage Coluan of the planet Colu, who claimed to be descended from the original Brainiac, one of Superman&#x27;s deadliest enemies, and wished to join the Legion as atonement for his misdeeds. When Brainiac 1 was revealed to be an android created by the Computer Tyrants, Brainiac 5 discovered he was descended from Brainiac 2, the clone of the original Brainiac and leader of the rebellion against the tyrants. Brainiac 5&#x27;s ingenuity led to the invention of, amongst other things, the Legion flight ring (perfecting an invention of the original Invisible Kid based on a metal discovered by Mon-El), the anti-lead serum that allowed Mon-El to leave the Phantom Zone and the force field belt which became the signature device of the character. Another of Brainiac 5&#x27;s creations had less beneficial effects: the super computer Computo, which attempted to take over the world, killing one of Triplicate Girl&#x27;s three selves in the process. He successfully destroyed his creation with &quot;an anti-matter force&quot;. Another experiment, performed in conjunction with honorary Legionnaire Rond Vidar, led to the transformation of fellow scientist Professor Jaxon Rugarth into the psychotic, all-powerful Infinite Man.

As time went on, Brainiac 5 began to be portrayed as unstable. Long attracted to Supergirl, Brainiac 5 created a robot duplicate of her in his sleep, convincing himself this was the real Supergirl. The Legion encountered Pulsar Stargrave, a villain who convinced Brainiac 5 that he was the Coluan&#x27;s long-lost father. Brainiac 5 joined Stargrave to battle the sorcerer Mordru, but the android&#x27;s influence would haunt him long after that. It was claimed in &quot;Superboy&quot; #225 that Stargrave was actually the original Brainiac android, but the truth of this is uncertain.

When Stargrave murders Ultra Boy&#x27;s ex-girlfriend An Ryd, Brainiac 5 frames Ultra Boy for the murder. Chameleon Boy, who suspected Brainiac 5 from the beginning, finds proof when Brainiac&#x27;s madness leads him to an attempt to destroy the universe using the Miracle Machine, a device that turns thoughts into reality. He is stopped by Matter-Eater Lad, who eats the machine, and both are committed to a mental institution (the energies of the Machine having driven Matter-Eater Lad insane). Brainiac 5 eventually recovers his sanity and rejoins the group. Shortly afterward, however, he is accused of having murdered Ultra Boy&#x27;s ex-girlfriend himself. To prove his innocence, he finds Stargrave and defeats him. He later manages to cure Matter-Eater Lad&#x27;s insanity. Around this time, he corrects another of his mistakes by finding a way of controlling Computo.

====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;====

Brainiac 5 enters a state of deep melancholy upon the thousand-year anniversary of Supergirl&#x27;s death at the hands of the Anti-Monitor during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. However, as the Crisis eliminated Supergirl from existence, Brainiac 5 (as well as everyone else) has no recollection of her. Beyond this, however, Brainiac 5&#x27;s history was relatively unaffected by the Crisis, although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new Brainiac 1. Following the death of the pocket universe Superboy, Brainiac 5 is one of a number of Legionnaires who swear revenge on the Time Trapper. To this end, he recreated the Infinite Man. The Infinite Man and Time Trapper seemingly destroy each other, but Brainiac 5 quits the Legion after being accused of murdering Professor Rugarth. He rejoins in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 3) #63 (August 1989), shortly before the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;.

====&quot;Five Year Gap&quot;====
Five years after the end of the &quot;Magic Wars&quot;, things had radically changed for the heroes, most notably the disbanding of the Legion and an ongoing war with the Khund Empire, which had resulted in Earth&#x27;s government (Earthgov) signing a deal with the Dominators. When &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4) began, Brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the Validus Plague, a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former Lightning Lad, Garth Ranzz. Soon after the start of &quot;Legion&quot; (vol. 4) a retcon removed the Superman family of characters almost completely from Legion continuity. Supergirl was replaced by Laurel Gand, a Daxamite descendant of Lar Gand&#x27;s brother. Unlike Supergirl, she was a native of the 30th century. Brainiac 5 and Laurel did have a relationship, but the couple eventually separated and she became the common law wife of Rond Vidar (a Legion ally and Green Lantern who had been a close friend of Brainiac 5).

Brainiac 5 joins other Legionnaires in searching for the space pirate Roxxas, and is present when the team officially reforms. The reassembled Legion repels a Khund invasion fleet and confronts Darkseid, but shortly thereafter, is swept into the war against the corrupt Earthgov and the Dominators. Furthermore, a temporal clone of Brainiac 5 from &quot;Batch SW6&quot; is introduced.

Not long after the destruction of Earth, Brainiac 5 discovers the timestream is unstable and that the Legion&#x27;s history is in a state of constant flux. He is rapidly aged by the sorceress Glorith before being killed when his universe is destroyed.

===&quot;Zero Hour&quot; reboot continuity (1994–2004)===

Following the Zero Hour event and the rebooting of the Legion, the &quot;new&quot; Brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues. He barely interacted with the other Legionnaires, although he was still somewhat attracted to Laurel Gand, now called Andromeda, who was now also something of an outsider. When Andromeda was believed killed, he was the only person who really missed her, a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion. It was later revealed that, even amongst Coluans, Querl Dox had been something of a loner, due to his even higher intelligence, interest in practical experiments rather than &quot;pure&quot; thought, and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments. It was also revealed that his mother, Brainiac 4, had abandoned him at birth, having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child. As a child, he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people, developing no social skills. Having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century, leading to the Legion&#x27;s rescue of Valor, Brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time-travel. He was later pardoned when R.J. Brande became President of the United Planets.

In addition to having a crush on Andromeda, Brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo-collection featuring Andromeda herself, Dreamer (Nura Nal), Spark (Ayla Ranzz) and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with &quot;In-&quot; (obviously Invisible Kid), and probably others. Before that, in a moment of rare emotional outburst, Brainy kisses Lyle&#x27;s cheek as he finds him again, and right after he feels embarrassed.

====Trapped in the 20th century====
Brainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century. He spent his efforts trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment. He finally produced a computer capable of doing this, utilizing a 30th Century Omnicom, a New Gods Mother Box loaned to him by Metron and the responsometer of Veridium of the Metal Men. Unfortunately, this became the post-Zero Hour C.O.M.P.U.T.O. The Legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time. While in the 20th century, he also encountered his ancestors, Brainiac and Vril Dox II, as well as the post-Crisis Supergirl. Ironically, he was attracted to Supergirl due to her similarity to Andromeda.

====Upgrade: Brainiac 5.1====
Upon his return, he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly. The anomaly &quot;upgraded&quot; him: he was now more considerate of others, and had vastly improved people skills. He also internalized his force shield apparatus. Following his return from the space anomaly, he befriends teammate Gates, who dubs him &quot;Brainiac 5.1&quot;.

Shortly after that, the Legion investigated the criminal/terrorist organization called the Dark Circle. Querl learned his mother, Brainiac 4, was the leader of the Dark Circle, having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions. The shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former, distant self. Although he did not revert, he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again. He also began researching without considering the consequences again, inadvertently transforming the team into a &quot;Bizarro Legion&quot;.

====&quot;Legion Lost&quot;====

Brainiac 5.1 was amongst the Legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the Stargate network was shut down. They spent a year travelling through the &quot;Lost Galaxy&quot;. During this time, he felt a great amount of stress, as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation. As he eventually confessed to Saturn Girl, he did not have a clue how to get them home - or even where &quot;home&quot; was, relative to their location. In the same conversation, he also complained that he&#x27;d &quot;always hated [his] name upgrade,&quot; and on the way out, as well as reassuring him, she made a point of redubbing him &quot;Brainiac Five,&quot; and he dropped the &quot;.1&quot; from his name thereafter. Eventually, using his teammate Shikari&#x27;s tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they&#x27;d earlier found, but been forced to leave, he did get them home. Upon their return, Brainiac began developing a replacement for the Stargates, based on the &quot;threshold&quot; doorway they had used to return from the Lost Galaxy. Restoring the connection to the planet Xanthu, they learned that it had been at war with Robotica, the &quot;robot homeworld&quot;, until they mysteriously disappeared. Robotica&#x27;s leader was revealed as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. A strike team was launched against it, but Brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself, so it no longer sought vengeance. It was revealed that the Coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence, however, and Brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine-life from destruction.
===&quot;DC One Million&quot;===

During the Reboot Legion&#x27;s heyday, they are tangentially involved in the &quot;DC One Million&quot; crossover, where the audience is shown the &quot;Justice Legion L&quot; of the 853rd Century. Loosely based on members of the Legion of the 31st Century, the Justice Legion L are tasked with protecting the remains of the United Planets, by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on Braal. Several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new, symbiotic worlds, including Colu-Bgztl. The Justice Legion L includes Brainiac 417, a counterpart to Brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world. As with all members of his race, he combines super-intelligence with an ephemeral, intangible state; Brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body. His race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought. Brainiac 417 is not the leader of the Justice Legion L (that duty fell to Cosmicbot), but is one of the most valuable members, and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of Superboy for the purposes of saving the day.

===&quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity (2004–2009)===
In volume 5 of the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; title, Brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor Vril Dox II in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot;. He is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially, but is more politically savvy. He has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting Legion leader Cosmic Boy, who suspects him of planning a coup. He also has problems with Dream Girl as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means. &quot;Brainy&quot; was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry. When she was killed during Terror Firma&#x27;s attack on the Legion HQ on Earth, he became obsessed with &quot;outthinking death.&quot; In a botched experiment to restore her to life, he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind, enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams, and keep using her precognition in his behalf. Following Cosmic Boy&#x27;s disappearance, Brainiac 5 has become the advisor to Legion leader Supergirl and later to Lightning Lad.

Brainiac 5 eventually proposes to Dream Girl after spending the night together in which Dream Girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist, however, on the same night, Princess Projectra has her own urges and primal, repressed emotion, viciously attack Dream Girl upon her return to Querl&#x27;s mind, viciously beating her and gouging out her eyes, leaving the girl blind and powerless, thus hoping to strip Brainiac 5 of her constant counseling. He much later manages to turn their dream into reality when, forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates, mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the cyberspace, creates a new body for Dream Girl, imprinting her personality, into the cloned body. Successful in his attempt, that, despite Nura&#x27;s previsions, even restored her lost sight, Brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage, holding hands with his resurrected soon-to-be bride Unbeknownst to Brainiac 5, the dark side of his mind, the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings, was granted a physical body by Princess Projectra.

===Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2007)===
The events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; story arc in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, and in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. This incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

====&quot;The Lightning Saga&quot;====

The pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac 5 appears in the Justice League/Justice Society &quot;Lightning Saga&quot; crossover. He is revealed as the mastermind behind the Legion&#x27;s plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to the Flash. At the end of the storyline, Brainiac 5 is seen holding one of the lightning rods the Legionnaires used on 21st century Earth, and told his teammates that the Legion had gotten what it came for. This Brainiac 5&#x27;s agenda does not end there, however; in the pages of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Una arrives in the present to stop Karate Kid from returning to the 31st century, explaining that Brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day.

====&quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;====

In this follow-up story to the Lightning Saga (taking place in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #858-863), Brainiac 5 masquerades as a tyrannical dictator to delay Colu, which is the strategical beachhead of a United Planets attack on Earth. Brainiac still possesses the Lightning Rod, and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the &quot;Crisis of the 31st century&quot;. However, his ruse is discovered, and Brainiac leaves with the Legion, with only four hours until the United Planets go to war. After Superman and the Legion defeat Earthman and his &quot;Justice League of Earth&quot;, and convince the armada to stand down, Brainiac 5 tells Superman that the Legion will not forget him this time.

====&quot;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&quot;====

In this &quot;Final Crisis&quot; tie-in, Brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being banished by Colu and facing continued xenophobia. He considers leaving the Legion, but is convinced to remain as a way to prove all his naysayers wrong. When Superboy-Prime attacks Takron-Galtos and frees the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainiac 5 informs his fellow Legionnaires of his plan to recruit their Post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; and &quot;Threeboot&quot; selves to help. His plan succeeds, and Brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities. The &quot;Threeboot&quot; version of Brainiac refuses to work with his older self, due to his rebellious nature, while the Post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced, and tries to mediate between his alternate selves. Despite their differences, all three versions of Brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original Brainiac&#x27;s master contingency plan against Superboy-Prime. This plan, which involved the resurrections of Superboy-Prime foes Bart Allen/Kid Flash (whose essence was in the lightning rod) and Superboy, was devised long ago when Brainiac 5 was forewarned of Prime&#x27;s arrival by one of Dream Girl&#x27;s prophesies.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
Brainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; miniseries, as is true for the Legion of Super-Heroes as a whole. However, the term &quot;Brainiac&quot; is no longer his name but an honorable title. This adds understanding to the opening arcs of &quot;Action Comics&quot; (vol. 2) (2011) by Grant Morrison, where an alien is stealing and bottling cities, an act usually committed by Brainiac, but is here only named &quot;the Collector&quot;.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
A younger Brainiac 5 appears briefly during &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 3) (2017) by Bryan Hitch, though unconnected to the Legion. He is also not referred to by his name, only as the &quot;brainy kid&quot; by Cyborg. After analyzing the Timeless technology with specialized contacts, he lends Cyborg his prototype flight bracelet, marked with the Brainiac sigil, so the League member can reach the weapon.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Doctor Manhattan erases Brainiac 5 and the Legion from existence before eventually restoring them.

==Powers and abilities==
Brainiac 5 possesses a twelfth-level intelligence, above the eighth-level intelligence of most Coluans. This gives him superhuman calculation skills, enhanced memory, and the ability to operate on several tracks of thought at once.

Brainiac 5 is also a skilled inventor who created the Legion&#x27;s flight rings as well as a force field belt, the supercomputer Computo, and a Time Bubble.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Brainiac 5 appears in TV series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). Following a non-speaking cameo appearance in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;New Kids In Town&quot;, he returns in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Far From Home&quot;, voiced by Matt Czuchry. This version is an organic being who was created to serve the original Brainiac before leaving him to join the Legion. After bringing Green Arrow, Supergirl, and Green Lantern to his time to help battle the Fatal Five, he falls in love with Supergirl, who decides to stay in the future to be with him and have a sense of belonging.
* Brainiac 5 appears in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006), voiced by Adam Wylie. This version is a young, nanotechnology-based cyborg who sports monochromatic pink eyes as well as transformative abilities, which he primarily uses to extend his limbs and assume a large, mecha-like form. Additionally, he was previously part of the Coluan hive mind before breaking off through unknown means and strives to prove himself to the older Legionnaires, especially new recruit Superman. In the second season, Imperiex manipulates Brainiac 5 into being possessed by the original Brainiac until he regains control with help from Superman and his clone Superman X and assumes a fully organic form. Brainiac 5 subsequently leaves the Legion out of guilt while Brainiac secretly rebuilds himself using his discarded armor.
* Brainiac 5 appears in the tenth season of &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by James Marsters. This version was created by the Legion after they reprogrammed the original Brainiac.
* Brainiac 5, also known as &quot;Brainy&quot;, appears in TV series set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Jesse Rath.
** First appearing in the third season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, he travels back in time to the 21st century with fellow Legionnaires Mon-El and Imra Ardeen to help Supergirl defeat Reign. After the original Brainiac creates a virus that renders the 31st century too dangerous to return to, Brainy stays in the past and joins the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO). In the fourth season, he becomes a mentor to and develops a romantic attraction towards Nia Nal while helping Supergirl and the DEO fight Agent Liberty and his Children of Liberty as well as Lex Luthor. In the fifth season, Brainy continues to explore his relationship with Nia, which is strained after an encounter with several of his multiversal doppelgangers leads to him disabling some of his personality inhibitors to maximize his intellectual capabilities and work with Luthor to combat Leviathan.
*** Meaghan Rath portrays a female alternate reality version of Brainy in the fifth season, in addition to Jesse portraying several alternate reality versions in &quot;The Bottle Episode&quot;.
** Brainy also appears in the crossover events &quot;Elseworlds&quot; and &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

<text>The Great Firewall (&quot;GFW&quot;; ) is the combination of legislative actions and technologies enforced by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to regulate the Internet domestically. Its role in internet censorship in China is to block access to selected foreign websites and to slow down cross-border internet traffic. The Great Firewall operates by checking transmission control protocol (TCP) packets for keywords or sensitive words. If the keywords or sensitive words appear in the TCP packets, access will be closed. If one link is closed, more links from the same machine will be blocked by the Great Firewall. The effect includes: limiting access to foreign information sources, blocking foreign internet tools (e.g. Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, and others) and mobile apps, and requiring foreign companies to adapt to domestic regulations.

Besides censorship, the Great Firewall has also influenced the development of China&#x27;s internal internet economy by giving preference to domestic companies and reducing the effectiveness of products from foreign internet companies. The techniques deployed by the Chinese government to maintain control of the Great Firewall can include modifying search results for terms, such as they did following Ai Weiwei’s arrest, and petitioning global conglomerates to remove content, as happened when they petitioned Apple to remove the &quot;Quartz&quot; business news publication’s app from its Chinese App Store after reporting on the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests.

The Great Firewall was formerly operated by the SIIO, as part of the Golden Shield Project. Since 2013, the firewall is technically operated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which is the entity in charge of translating the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s ideology and policy into technical specifications.

As mentioned in the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle, China&#x27;s special administrative regions (SARs) such as Hong Kong and Macau are not affected by the firewall, as SARs have their own governmental and legal systems and therefore enjoy a higher degree of autonomy. Nevertheless, the U.S. State Department has reported that the central government authorities have closely monitored Internet use in these regions, and Hong Kong&#x27;s National Security Law has been used to block websites documenting anti-government protests.

The term &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot; is a combination of the word firewall with the Great Wall of China. The phrase &quot;Great Firewall of China&quot; was first used in print by Australian sinologist Geremie Barmé in 1997.

==History==
A favorite saying of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s in the early 1980s, &quot;If you open the window, both fresh air and flies will be blown in&quot;, is considered to be the political and ideological basis of the GFW Project. The saying is related to a period of the economic reform of China that became known as the &quot;socialist market economy&quot;. Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy and opened up the market for foreign investors. Nonetheless, despite the economic freedom, values and political ideas of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have had to be protected by &quot;swatting flies&quot; of other unwanted ideologies.

The internet in China arrived in 1994, as the inevitable consequence of and supporting tool for a &quot;socialist market economy&quot;. Gradually, while Internet availability has been increasing, the Internet has become a common communication platform and tool for trading information.

The Ministry of Public Security took initial steps to control Internet use in 1997, when it issued comprehensive regulations governing its use. The key sections, Articles 4–6, are:
In 1998, the Chinese Communist Party feared that the China Democracy Party (CDP) would breed a powerful new network that CCP elites might not be able to control. The CDP was immediately banned, followed by arrests and imprisonment. That same year, the GFW project was started. The first part of the project lasted eight years and was completed in 2006. The second part began in 2006 and ended in 2008.
On 6 December 2002, 300 people in charge of the GFW project from 31 provinces and cities throughout China participated in a four-day inaugural &quot;Comprehensive Exhibition on Chinese Information System&quot;. At the exhibition, many western high-tech products, including Internet security, video monitoring and human face recognition were purchased. It is estimated that around 30,000–50,000 police were employed in this gigantic project.
Fang Binxing is known for his substantial contribution to China&#x27;s Internet censorship infrastructure, and has been dubbed &quot;Father of China&#x27;s Great Fire Wall&quot;.

==Origins of Chinese Internet law==
China&#x27;s view of the Internet is one of &quot;Internet sovereignty&quot;: the notion that the Internet inside the country is part of the country&#x27;s sovereignty and should be governed by the country.

While the United States and several other western countries passed laws creating computer crimes beginning in the 1970s, China had no such legislation until 1997. That year, China&#x27;s sole legislative body – the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) – passed CL97, a law that deals with cyber crimes, which it divided into two broad categories: crimes that target computer networks, and crimes carried out over computer networks. Behavior illegal under the latter category includes, among many things, the dissemination of pornographic material, and the usurping of &quot;state secrets.&quot;

Some Chinese judges were critical of CL97, calling it ineffective and unenforceable. However, the NPC claimed that it intentionally left the law &quot;flexible&quot; so that it could be open to future interpretation and development. Given the gaps in the law, the central government of China relies heavily on its administrative body, the State Council, to determine what falls under the definitions, and their determinations are not required to go through the NPC legislative process. As a result, the Chinese Communist Party has ended up relying heavily on state regulation to carry out CL97.

The latter definition of online activities punishable under CL97, or &quot;crimes carried out over computer networks&quot;, is used as justification for the Great Firewall, and can be cited when the government blocks any ISP, gateway connections, or any access to anything on the internet. The definition also includes using the internet to distribute information considered &quot;harmful to national security,&quot; and using the internet to distribute information considered &quot;harmful to public order, social stability, and Chinese morality.&quot; The central government relies heavily on its State Council regulators to determine what specific online behavior and speech fall under these definitions.

The reasons behind the Internet censorship in China include:
* Social control: the Internet is a means for freedom of speech, and dissemination of campaigns could lead to protests against the government.
* Sensitive content: to control information about the government in China. 
* Economic protectionism: China prefers the use of local companies that are regulated by Chinese regulations, since they have more power over them, e.g. Baidu over Google.

==Campaigns and crackdowns==
As part of the Great Firewall, beginning in 2003, China started the Golden Shield Project, a massive surveillance and censoring system, the hardware for which was provided by mostly U.S. companies, including Cisco Systems. The project was completed in 2006, and is now carried out in buildings with machines operated by civilians and supervised by China&#x27;s national police force, the Public Security Bureau (PSB). The main operating procedures of the gatekeepers at the Golden Shield Project include monitoring domestic websites, email, and searching for politically sensitive language and calls to protest. When damaging content is found, local PSB officials can be dispatched to investigate or make arrests. However, by late 2007, the Golden Shield Project proved to operate sporadically at best, as users had long adapted to internet blocking by using proxy servers, among other strategies, to make communications and circumnavigate to blocked content.

Internet cafés, an extremely popular way of getting online in developing countries and where fewer people can afford a personal computer, are regulated by the Chinese government and by local Chinese government officials. Minors (in China, those under the age of 18) are not allowed into Internet cafés, although this law is widely ignored, and when enforced, has spurred the creation of underground &quot;Black Web Bars&quot; visited by those underage. As of 2008, internet cafés were required to register every customer in a log when they used the internet there. These records may be confiscated by either local government officials or the PSB. To illustrate local regulation of internet cafés, in one instance, a government official in the town of Gedong lawfully banned internet cafés from operating in the town because he believed them to be harmful to minors, who frequented them to play online games (including those considered violent) and surf the internet. However, internet cafés in this town simply went underground, and most minors were not deterred from visiting them.

In May 2015, China indefinitely blocked access to the Chinese-language Wikipedia. In 2017, China discussed plans for its own version of Wikipedia. As of May 2019, all language versions of Wikipedia have been blocked by the Chinese government.

==Blocking methods==

===Active filtering===
One function of the Chinese firewall is to selectively prevent content from being accessed. It is mostly made of Cisco, Huawei, and Semptian hardware. Not all sensitive content gets blocked; in 2007, scholar Jedidiah R. Crandall and others argued that the main purpose is not to block 100%, but rather to flag and to warn, in order to encourage self-censorship. An illustrative but incomplete list of tactics includes:

=== Active probing ===
In addition to previously discussed techniques, the CAC is also using active probing in order to identify and block network services that would help escaping the firewall. Multiple services such as Tor or VPN providers reported receiving unsolicited TCP/IP connections shortly after legitimate use, for the purported purpose of network enumeration of services, in particular TLS/SSL and Tor services, with the aim of facilitating IP blocking. For example, shortly after a VPN request is issued by a legitimate Chinese VPN client and passes outbound though the Great Firewall to a hidden VPN IP, the Great Firewall may detect the activity and issue its own active probe to verify the nature of the previously unknown VPN IP and, if the probe confirms the IP is part of a blacklisted VPN, blacklist the IP. This attack can be circumvented with the Obfs4 protocol, which relies on an out-of-band shared secret.

=== Proxy distribution ===
The Great Firewall scrapes the IPs of Tor and VPN servers from the official distribution channels, and enumerates them. The strategy to resist this attack is to limit the quantity of proxy IPs revealed to each user and making it very difficult for users to create more than one identity. Academics have proposed solutions such as Salmon, a volunteer-based proxy network designed to combat censorship. Dynamic IPs are quite effective to flush out from blacklists.

==Goals, impact and resistance==

=== Goal of the Firewall ===
Article 15 of a 20 September 2000 document from the Chinese State Council, posted by the Xinhua News Agency, lists 9 categories of information which should be censored, blocked, or filtered from access to the citizens using the internet within China:

# Opposing the basic principles as they are confirmed in the Constitution.
# Jeopardizing the security of the nation, divulging state secrets, subverting state power, or jeopardizing the integrity of the nation&#x27;s unity
# Harming the honor or the interests of the nation
# Inciting hatred against peoples, racism against peoples, or disrupting the solidarity of peoples
# Disrupting national policies on religion, propagating evil cults and feudal superstitions
# Spreading rumors, disturbing social order or disrupting social stability
# Spreading obscenity, pornography, gambling, violence, murder, terror, or abetting the commission of a crime
# Insulting or defaming third parties, infringing on the legal rights and interests of third parties
# Containing any other content prohibited by law or administrative rules

To filter this content, the Chinese government not only uses its own blocking methods, but also heavily relies on internet companies, such as ISPs, social media operators such as Weibo, and others to actively censor their users. This results in private companies censoring their own platform for filtered content, forcing Chinese internet users to use websites not hosted in China to access this information. Much of this information is related to sensitive topics. The Great Firewall&#x27;s goal is perceived by the Chinese Communist Party as helping to protect the Chinese population by preventing users from accessing these foreign websites which, in their opinion, host content which would be &#x27;spiritual pollution&#x27;, as well as information about these sensitive topics. These topics include:

* Names of paramount leaders, such as Xi Jinping and Deng Xiaoping
* Political movements and protests
* Falun Gong and other spiritual groups
* The Tiananmen Square Massacre
* The Xinjiang internment camps
* Discussions of Tibetan Independence

A 2020 study found that the Great Firewall blocks approximately 311,000 domains.

=== Impact on people in China ===
The Cybersecurity Law behind the firewall is targeted at helping increase internet user privacy, increase protections on personal data, and making companies more responsible for monitoring bad actors, in hopes to make the Internet a safer place for Chinese citizens. Despite this, there have been growing criticisms that the actions of the Chinese government have only hurt Chinese free speech, due to increased censorship, and lack of non-sanctioned sources of information, such as Wikipedia and many English news sources. This has resulted in reports of some cases of legal persecution of those charged with spreading this information.

The Chinese government itself does legally support free speech; article 35 of the Constitutions of the People&#x27;s Republic states that &quot;citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration.&quot; In recent decades, many criticisms of the Chinese government found that some of these laws are often abused. A study by PEN America claimed that &quot;Some of the government&#x27;s most rights-abusive laws are aimed at criminalizing free speech that — in the eyes of the government — encourages subversion, separatism, or rejection of the State’s authority.&quot;

Censorship of sensitive topics in China has also been easier for the government because of the firewall and its filtering. Because the monitoring of social media and chat apps in China presents a possibility of punishment for a user, the discussion of these topics is now limited to the thought of the Chinese Communist Party, or one&#x27;s home and private spaces, reducing the chance for information about these topics to spread, reducing any threat of protest against the CCP. According to Yaqiu Wang, a prominent human rights researcher, there was a time in China where the internet provided a method for Chinese citizens to learn about the sensitive topics the government had censored in the news, through access to international news reports and media coverage. She claims that, in the past 10 years, it has been increasingly difficult to access second opinions on events, meaning that students rarely have the opportunity to learn diverging viewpoints — only the &quot;correct&quot; thought of the CCP.

=== Economic impacts ===
The Great Firewall has also allowed China to develop its own major internet services, such as Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Renren, Youku, and Weibo. China has its own version of many foreign web properties, for example: Bilibili and Tencent Video (YouTube), Weibo (Twitter), Moments and Qzone (Facebook), WeChat (WhatsApp), Ctrip (Orbitz and others), and Zhihu (Quora). With nearly one quarter of the global internet population (700 million users), the internet behind the GFW can be considered a &quot;parallel universe&quot; to the Internet that exists outside.

=== Resistance ===
While the Great Firewall has had an impact on Chinese citizens&#x27; ability to use the internet to find information about sensitive topics about the Chinese Communist Party, it has not completely stopped them from doing so. The firewall itself has caused much frustration amongst both individuals and internationally operating companies in China, many of whom have turned to VPNs, speaking in codes, and other methods to retain their access to the international internet.

==Circumvention==
=== Methods for bypassing the firewall ===
Because the Great Firewall blocks destination IP addresses and domain names and inspects the data being sent or received, a basic censorship circumvention strategy is to use proxy nodes and encrypt the data. Bypassing the firewall is known as (翻墙, &quot;climb over the wall&quot;), and most circumvention tools combine these two mechanisms:
* Proxy servers outside China can be used, although using just a simple open proxy (HTTP or SOCKS) without also using an encrypted tunnel (such as HTTPS) does little to circumvent the sophisticated censors.
* Freegate, Ultrasurf, Psiphon, and Lantern are free programs designed and experienced with circumventing the China firewall using multiple open proxies.
* VPNs (virtual private networks) are one of the most popular tools used by Westerners for bypassing censorship technologies. They use the same basic approaches, proxies, and encrypted channels used by other circumvention tools, but depend on a private host, a virtual host, or an account outside of China, rather than open, free proxies.
* Tor partially can be used in China. Since 2010, almost all bridges at TorProject.org are blocked through proxy distribution. Tor still functions in China using Snowflake, independently published Obfs4 bridges and meek.
* I2P or garlic routing is useful when properties similar to Tor&#x27;s anonymity are needed. Due to I2P being much less popular than Tor, it has faced little to no blocking attempts.
In 2017, the Chinese government declared unauthorized VPN services illegal, requiring VPN providers to obtain state approval. Although China restricts VPNs, they remain widely used by private individuals. State-owned enterprises or state institutions also use VPNs for official work. The Chinese government has authorized several official VPN providers. Those who develop or sell their own VPNs potentially face years in prison.

Non-proxy circumvention strategies include:
* Using encrypted DNS may bypass blocking of a few sites including TorProject and all of GitHub, which may be used to obtain further circumvention. In 2019 Firefox released an update to make it easy to enable DNS over HTTPS. Despite DNS over encryption, the majority of services remain blocked by IP.
* Ignoring TCP reset packets sent by the GFW. Distinguishing them by the TTL value (time to live), and not routing any further packets to sites that have triggered blocking behavior.

=== Known blocked methods ===
* The OpenVPN protocol is detected and blocked. Connections not using symmetric keys or using &quot;tls-auth&quot; are blocked at handshake, and connections using the new &quot;tls-crypt&quot; option are detected and throttled (under 56 kbit/s) by the QoS filtering system.
* GRE tunnels and protocols that use GRE (e.g., PPTP) are blocked.
* TLS, the Great Firewall can identify the difference between HTTPS TLS and other implementations by inspecting the handshake parameters.

==Outside China==
===Off-target incidents===
In 2010, a root name server run by Netnod in China started returning poisoned DNS results to global users, preventing users in Chile and the U.S. from accessing sites such as Facebook. The server was shut down to stop the poisoning.

In 2014, two-thirds of China&#x27;s DNS infrastructure began resolving unrelated domains to 65.49.2.178, an address owned by the US-based Dynamic Internet Technology, Inc., resulting in widespread internet outage in China. No damage to DIT services were reported despite what amounts to an accidental DDoS. While some sources attribute this incident to GFW&#x27;s DNS poisoning, others (mostly quoting Chinese sources) speculate this incident was somehow caused by DIT themselves.

=== Exporting Great Firewall technology ===
Reporters Without Borders suspects that countries such as Cuba, Iran, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, and Belarus have obtained surveillance technology from China, although the censorship in these countries is less stringent than in China.

Since at least 2015, the Russian Roskomnadzor agency collaborates with Chinese Great Firewall security officials in implementing its data retention and filtering infrastructure. During his visit to Beijing in June 2016, Vladimir Putin signed a joint communiqué with Xi Jinping on information space, followed by Russia&#x27;s National Forum for Information Security in October hosted by Fang Binxing, the architect of the Chinese Great Firewall.

Especially since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in order to enforce the war censorship law, Russian authorities were making an internet surveillance system akin to Chinese Great Firewall.

=== Opposition ===
Critics have argued that if other large countries begin following China&#x27;s approach, the whole purpose of the creation of the Internet could be put in jeopardy. If like-minded countries are successful in imposing the same restrictions on their inhabitants and globalized online companies, then the free global exchange of information could cease to exist.

The United States Trade Representative&#x27;s (USTR) &quot;National Trade Estimate Report&quot; in 2016 referred the China&#x27;s digital Great Firewall: &quot;China&#x27;s filtering of cross-border Internet traffic has posed a significant burden to foreign suppliers.&quot; Claude Barfield, the American Enterprise Institute&#x27;s expert of International trade, suggested that the U.S. government should bring a case against the Firewall, a huge trade barrier, in the World Trade Organization in January 2017. Eight of the 24 more trafficked websites in China have been blocked by the Great Firewall. This has created a burden to foreign suppliers who rely on these websites to sell their products or services. The lobby&#x27;s 2016 business climate survey showed 79 percent of its members reported a negative impact on business due to internet censorship.

According to Stephen Rosen, the GFW is reflective of the Chinese government&#x27;s fear of civil disobedience or rebellion among the Chinese population against the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s rule:

<text>Mákina is a subgenre of hardcore techno, originating in Spain. Similar to UK hardcore, it includes elements of bouncy techno and hard trance, it also incorporates influence from Eurodance, and the tempo ranges from 150 to 180 BPM.

==History==
===Early 1990s: Origins===
Dance music in Spain became prominent in 1988 with the rise of acid house. Mákina followed this trend and has its origins in the early 1990s in Valencia, Spain. Derived from another style called bakalao, the local name given to an association of electronic dance music played together with pop and rock tunes in Valencian clubs in the second half of the 1980s.

===Mid-1990s: Breakthrough and success===
The genre gained prominence in 1991 when Spanish producer Chimo Bayo released his single, &quot;Así me gusta a mí&quot;. The song was a success throughout Europe and the genre soon gained prominence. The genre became extremely popular throughout Spain from 1995 to 1997, as many mákina-oriented singles reached number one on the Spanish Singles Chart. Spanish mákina group EX-3 had two number-one singles, &quot;Extres&quot; and &quot;Ex-P-Cial&quot; in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Perhaps the most recognized mákina single in the United States is &quot;Streamline&quot; by Newton, which was popularized by a 2006 Pepsi television advertisement starring Jimmy Fallon.

From the late 1990s to current times the genre is the staple of the rave scene in North East England and Scotland. Following the closures of the most prominent venues – in particular The New Monkey nightclub – its popularity has slightly faded in those areas and has been partially replaced with scouse house. Despite this it still retains a strong cultural legacy, regularly heard blasting from coaches when Newcastle United and Sunderland AFC play away matches.

<text>Ayla Ranzz, also known as Lightning Lass, Light Lass, Gossamer, and Spark, is a character appearing in media published by DC Comics. She is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th and 31st centuries, as well as the sister of Lightning Lad and Lightning Lord.

There have been three versions of Ayla since her original debut; these versions are separated by the events of both the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series.

Ayla has made limited appearances in media outside comics, including the animated series &quot;&quot; and &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; and the animated film &quot;Justice League vs. the Fatal Five&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
Ayla Ranzz first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #308 (May 1963). She is the twin sister of fellow Legionnaire Garth (Lightning Lad) and the younger sister of the villainous Mekt (Lightning Lord). All three gained their electric powers after being attacked by creatures called lightning beasts on the planet Korbal. She originally joined the Legion disguised as her brother Lightning Lad following his death at the hands of Zaryan. Her being an imposter was soon discovered, but she was admitted into the Legion as Lightning Lass. Later, Ayla gained gravity manipulation powers from Dream Girl, and became known as Light Lass.

Years later, Ayla left the Legion for a time, disillusioned with her Legion career and having ended a lengthy romance with fellow Legionnaire Timber Wolf. She broke up with him following a misunderstanding when she saw Timber Wolf embracing Saturn Girl while both were stranded on a frozen asteroid. Eventually returning to Winath, Ayla was kidnapped by her brother Lightning Lord and a faction of the Legion of Super-Villains. When Ayla refused to join them, her brother tried to kill her, though she survived and discovered that her original lightning powers had been restored. After the LSV was defeated, she rejoined the Legion as Lightning Lass.

During the &quot;Five Year Later&quot; storyline, it was revealed that Ayla had entered a relationship with Shrinking Violet.

A temporal clone of Ayla from &quot;Batch SW6&quot; appears in the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot; following the Magic Wars.

===Post-Zero Hour (Spark)===

Ayla, known as Spark, originally joined the Legion as a replacement for her twin brother Live Wire, as their planet Winath decided to choose her rather than Garth, who had been classified as a runaway. Eventually, the &quot;one member per planet&quot; restriction was lifted, and he rejoined.

She was one of the Legion members stranded in the 21st century for a time as a result of the Emerald Eye&#x27;s machinations. Her team helped the modern superheroes during the &quot;Final Night&quot; crisis, where Earth&#x27;s sun was slowly being devoured. Spark personally provides the electricity to Guy Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Warriors&quot; facility when the power went out while it was being used as a hospital. Some time after the sun was restored, she travels into the Source, which replaces her electrical powers with anti-gravity powers (although she did not change her codename). Upon returning to the 31st century and reuniting with her brother, however, she began to experience debilitating headaches when using her powers; the headaches were diagnosed as psychosomatic. Apparently, she could not handle having different powers than her brother. In a desperate attempt to restore her old powers, she returned to Korbal, the planetoid where she and her brothers originally gained their powers after being shocked by Lightning Beasts, rendering them comatose for several months. Ayla is killed after being electrocuted a second time before Garth resurrects her. Shortly afterward, she became romantically associated with fellow Legionnaire Chameleon, who had a longstanding crush on her.

Later, the Legion was disbanded after the apparent death of several of her teammates (including her brother and Chameleon) and she returned to Winath. When these teammates returned, Garth was not among them, having apparently sacrificed himself so the rest could return home. After Chameleon broke this news to her, she apparently did not resume her relationship with him. She briefly took the name Live Wire after this, but shortly before his return, Kid Quantum convinced her that she would better honor her brother by being herself.

===Threeboot (Light Lass)===

Following another reboot of Legion continuity, Ayla Ranzz is again called Light Lass, and has gravity nullifying powers. In &quot;Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; #26, it is revealed that she, like her siblings, had previously gained lightning powers after the accident on Korbal before another unspecified accident gave her gravitational powers.

Light Lass had a reputation as the Legion&#x27;s &quot;party girl&quot;, and had relationships with Ultra Boy, Timber Wolf, and Sun Boy, as well as a one-night stand with Karate Kid. Brainiac 5 commented that he finds it aggravating that the ability to negate one of the fundamental forces is in the hands of someone who treats things so flippantly. She however has been shown to take some things seriously, most notably dealing with her brother Mekt.

Ayla took a serious and active role in assisting her brother Garth when he became Legion Leader following Supergirl&#x27;s return to her time. Ayla also assisted Brainiac 5 and Star Boy in stabilizing gravity after an intruder planet appeared in the Sol system.

===Post-Infinite Crisis - Return of original Lightning Lass===
The events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries restored an analogue of the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Legion to continuity, as seen in &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; story arc in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, and in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, Ayla Ranzz is included in the Legion, possessing her original powers as Lightning Lass.

In the Lightning Saga, it was initially implied that she was presumed dead by Timber Wolf, who said &quot;I&#x27;m coming, Ayla&quot; as he was about to sacrifice his life. It was later revealed that the two have reconciled and are once again in a romantic relationship. She appears in the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; arc, serving as the power source for the hidden Legion headquarters.

Ayla is next seen in &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; #1, where she used her abilities to hold open the entrance to the Phantom Zone so her fellow Legionnaires Shadow Lass and Phantom Girl can rescue Mon-El. Ayla destroyed the Zone machine before Kryptonian criminal Zod has a chance to escape. She and her counterparts were later used as part of an experiment by Brainiac 5 to restore Bart Allen, with Ayla and Spark providing XS with lightning charges, and Light Lass using her gravity powers to prevent XS from becoming a singularity. Light Lass is later needed to extract the Kryptonian Chrysalis in Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude.

Ayla was later seen in issue #6 of Paul Levitz&#x27;s new &quot;Legion of Superheroes&quot; series, where she was shown preparing to go on a holiday vacation with Shrinking Violet. It is subsequently revealed that the two are romantically involved. Following the cancellation of the &quot;Legion of Superheroes&quot; series (and the Legion&#x27;s disbanding), Ayla is depicted back home on Winath, but it is unclear whether Shrinking Violet is living with her there.

<doc id="713563" wikidata="Q146793" url="?curid=713563" title="Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor, Op. 111, is the last of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas. The work was written between 1821 and 1822. Like other late period sonatas, it contains fugal elements. It was dedicated to his friend, pupil, and patron, Archduke Rudolf.

The sonata consists of two contrasting movements. The second movement is marked as an &quot;arietta&quot; with variations. Thomas Mann called it &quot;farewell to the sonata form&quot;. The work entered the repertoire of leading pianists only in the second half of the 19th century. Rhythmically visionary and technically demanding, it is one of the most discussed of Beethoven&#x27;s works.

==History==
Beethoven conceived of the plan for his final three piano sonatas (Op. 109, 110 and 111) during the summer of 1820, while he worked on his Missa solemnis. Although the work was only seriously outlined by 1819, the famous first theme of the &quot;allegro ed appassionato&quot; was found in a draft book dating from 1801 to 1802, contemporary to his Second Symphony. Moreover, the study of these draft books implies that Beethoven initially had plans for a sonata in three movements, quite different from that which we know: it is only thereafter that the initial theme of the first movement became that of the String Quartet No. 13, and that what should have been used as the theme with the adagio—a slow melody in A—was abandoned. Only the motif planned for the third movement, the famous theme mentioned above, was preserved to become that of the first movement. The &quot;Arietta&quot;, too, offers a considerable amount of research on its themes; the drafts found for this movement seem to indicate that as the second movement took form, Beethoven gave up the idea of a third movement, the sonata finally appearing to him as ideal.

Along with Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli&quot;, Op. 120 (1823) and his two collections of bagatelles—Op. 119 (1822) and Op. 126 (1823)—the sonata was one of Beethoven&#x27;s last compositions for piano. Nearly ignored by contemporaries, it was not until the second half of the 19th century that it found its way into the repertoire of most leading pianists.

==Structure==
The sonata is in two highly contrasting movements:

Typical performances take 7–10 minutes for the first movement, and 15–20 minutes for the second, though the range of timings is wide. There are a few recordings that take more than 20 minutes for the second movement, e.g. Barenboim (21 minutes), Afanassiev (22 minutes) and Ugorski (27 minutes).

===I. &quot;Maestoso – Allegro con brio ed appassionato&quot;===
&quot;Duration of roughly 7–11 minutes.&quot;

The first movement, like many other works by Beethoven in C minor, is stormy and impassioned—the tempo markings may be translated, respectively, as &quot;majestic&quot; and &quot;brisk, with vigor and passion&quot;. It abounds in diminished seventh chords, as in for instance the first full bar of its opening introduction, which may have provided the inspiration for the introduction of Chopin&#x27;s Second Piano Sonata:

Unlike Beethoven&#x27;s other C minor sonata-form movements, the exposition of this movement moves to the submediant (A major), not to the mediant, as its second key area. The quiet second theme bears a resemblance to the second theme in the final movement of the fourteenth piano sonata, made even more explicit in the recapitulation where this theme is restated ominously in the bass in minor mode, after initially appearing in C major. Overall, the first movement contains motivic similarities with Mozart&#x27;s Adagio and Fugue in C minor, which Beethoven arranged for a string quartet (Hess 37).

The A major closing theme of the exposition, based on the first motif of the first theme, initiates a chromatic descent to its dominant with the motif A–C–G – and the same motif appears in the theme&#x27;s restatement in the recapitulation, this time at the culmination of the chromatic descent instead of at the beginning. This moment is also prepared by the inclusion of the minor-mode inflected flattened sixth (F) at the corresponding point in the exposition&#x27;s closing theme.

In a move that mirrors the Piano Sonata, Op. 49 No. 1, and the Cello Sonata, Op. 5 No. 2, Beethoven ends this movement with a Picardy third that directly prepares the major-mode finale.

===II. &quot;Arietta: Adagio molto semplice e cantabile&quot;===
&quot;Duration of roughly 14–20 minutes&quot;
The final movement, in C major, is a set of five variations on a 16-bar theme in , with a final coda. The last two variations (Var. 4 and 5) are famous for introducing small notes which constantly divide the bar into 27 beats, which is very uncommon. Beethoven eventually introduces a trill which gives the impression of a further acceleration. The tempo marking may be translated &quot;slowly, very simple and songlike.&quot;

Beethoven&#x27;s markings indicate that he wished variations 2–4 to be played to the same basic (ternary) pulse as the theme, first variation and subsequent sections (that is, each of the three intra-bar groupings move at the same speed regardless of time signature; Beethoven uses the direction &quot;L&#x27;istesso tempo&quot; at each change of time signature). The simplified time signatures ( for and for ; both implying unmarked triplets) support this. However, in performance, the theme and first variation sound much slower, with wide spaces between the chords, and the second variation (and much more so, the third variation) faster, because of the shorter note values that create a doubling (and redoubling) of the effective compound time groupings. The third variation has a powerful, stomping, dance-like character with falling swung sixty-fourth notes, and heavy syncopation. Mitsuko Uchida has remarked that this variation, to a modern ear, has a striking resemblance to cheerful boogie-woogie, and the closeness of it to jazz and ragtime, which were still over 70 years into the future at the time, has often been pointed out by, among others, Igor Stravinsky. Jeremy Denk, for example, describes the second movement using terms like &quot;proto-jazz&quot; and &quot;boogie-woogie&quot;. Conversely, András Schiff repudiates that hypothesis, maintaining that it has nothing to do with jazz or boogie-woogie. From the fourth variation onwards the time signature returns to the original but divided into constant triplet thirty-second notes, effectively creating a doubly compound meter (equivalent to ).

The work is one of the most famous compositions of the composer&#x27;s &quot;late period&quot; and is widely performed and recorded. The pianist Robert Taub has called it &quot;a work of unmatched drama and transcendence ... the triumph of order over chaos, of optimism over anguish.&quot; John Lill sees Beethoven&#x27;s struggle that permeates the first movement as physically challenging pianists performing this work; even in the opening of the sonata, for instance, there is a downward leap of a seventh in the left hand – Beethoven is making his pianists physically struggle to reach the notes. Alfred Brendel commented of the second movement that &quot;what is to be expressed here is distilled experience&quot; and &quot;perhaps nowhere else in piano literature does mystical experience feel so immediately close at hand&quot;.

Asked by Anton Schindler why the work has only two movements (this was unusual for a classical sonata but not unique among Beethoven&#x27;s works for piano), the composer is said to have replied &quot;I didn&#x27;t have the time to write a third movement.&quot; However, according to Robert Greenberg, this may have just as easily been the composer&#x27;s prickly personality shining through, since the balance between the two movements is such that it obviates the need for a third. Jeremy Denk points out that Beethoven &quot;whittles away everything down to the absolute difference of the two movements&quot;, &quot;an Allegro and an Adagio, two opposed poles&quot;, and suggests that &quot;as with the greatest Beethoven pieces, the structure itself becomes a message&quot;.

==Legacy==
Chopin greatly admired this sonata. In two of his works, the Second Piano Sonata and the Revolutionary Étude, he alluded to the opening and ending of the sonata&#x27;s first movement, respectively (compare the opening bars of the two sonatas, and bars 77–81 of Chopin&#x27;s Étude with bars 150–152 in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s sonata).

Prokofiev based the structure of his Symphony No. 2 on this sonata. Karol Szymanowski also formally modelled his Symphony No. 2 after Beethoven&#x27;s sonata.

In 2009, the Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a composition for piano solo entitled &quot;Op. 111 – Bagatella su Beethoven&quot;, which is a blend of themes from this sonata and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s musical monogram DSCH.

The work is referenced in chapter 8 of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Doktor Faustus&quot;. Wendell Kretschmar, the town organist and music teacher, delivers a lecture on the sonata to a bemused audience, in the fictional town of Kaisersaschern on the Saale, playing the piece on an old piano while declaiming his lecture over the music:

In his technical musical excurses, Mann borrowed extensively from Theodor Adorno&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (and Adorno indeed played this particular opus for Mann), to the extent that some critics consider him as the novel&#x27;s tacit co-author. The influence is particularly strong in the passages outlining Kretschmar&#x27;s lectures.

<text>Waimea Canyon, also known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a large canyon, approximately ten miles (16 km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western side of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States. Waimea is Hawaiian for &quot;reddish water&quot;, a reference to the erosion of the canyon&#x27;s red soil. The canyon was formed by a deep incision of the Waimea River arising from the extreme rainfall on the island&#x27;s central peak, Mount Waialeale, among the wettest places on earth.

==Geology==
The canyon is carved into the tholeiitic and post-shield calc-alkaline lavas of the canyon basalt. The lavas of the canyon provide evidence of massive faulting and collapse in the island&#x27;s early history. The west side of the canyon is all thin, west-dipping lavas of the Napali Member. In contrast, the east side is very thick, flat-lying lavas of the Olokele and Makaweli Members. The two sides are separated by an enormous fault along which a large part of the island moved downwards in a big collapse.

The canyon has a unique geologic history as it was formed not only by the steady process of erosion but also by the catastrophic collapse of the volcano that created Kauai.

Like the other Hawaiian islands, Kauai is the top of an enormous volcano rising from the ocean floor. With lava flows dated to about 5 million years ago, Kauai is the oldest of the large Hawaiian islands. Roughly 4 million years ago, while Kauai was still erupting almost continuously, a portion of the island collapsed. This collapse formed a depression which then filled with lava flows.

In the time since, rainwater from the slopes of Mount Waialeale have eroded Waimea Canyon along one edge of the collapse. On the east side of the canyon, the cliff walls are built from thick lava flows that pooled in the depression. Over time, the exposed basalt has weathered from its original black to bright red.

==Geography==
Waimea Canyon State Park encompasses 1,866 acres (7.5 km2) and is a popular tourist attraction on the island. It provides a wilderness area with numerous hiking trails. It can be accessed from Waimea on Hawaiʻi state road 550, which is 18 miles long and leads up to Kōkeʻe State Park. The island of Niʻihau, only a short distance west of Kauaʻi at that point, can be clearly seen from the highway.

<text>A Game of Thrones is the first novel in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, a series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin. It was first published on August 1, 1996. The novel won the 1997 Locus Award and was nominated for both the 1997 Nebula Award and the 1997 World Fantasy Award. The novella &quot;Blood of the Dragon&quot;, comprising the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel, won the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella. In January 2011, the novel became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller and reached No. 1 on the list in July 2011.

In the novel, recounting events from various points of view, Martin introduces the plot-lines of the noble houses of Westeros, the Wall, and the Targaryens. The novel has inspired several spin-off works, including several games. It is also the namesake and basis for the first season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, an HBO television series that premiered in April 2011. A paperback TV tie-in re-edition was published in March 2013, titled &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; follows three principal storylines simultaneously.

===In the Seven Kingdoms===
Upon the death of Lord Jon Arryn, the principal advisor to King Robert Baratheon, Robert recruits his childhood friend Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, now Warden of the North, to replace Arryn as Hand of the King, and to betroth his daughter Sansa to Robert&#x27;s son Joffrey. Ned accepts the position when he learns that Arryn&#x27;s widow Lysa believes he was poisoned by Robert&#x27;s wife Queen Cersei Lannister and her family. Shortly thereafter, Ned&#x27;s son Bran discovers Cersei having sex with her twin brother Jaime Lannister, who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair, leaving him comatose and paralyzing his legs.

Ned leaves his castle, Winterfell, and departs for the capital city, King&#x27;s Landing, bringing along his daughters Sansa and Arya. Upon arriving in King&#x27;s Landing to take his post as Hand, Ned finds that Robert is an ineffective king whose only interests are hunting, drinking, and womanizing.

At Winterfell, an assassin attempts to kill Bran while he is unconscious, and Ned&#x27;s wife Catelyn travels to King&#x27;s Landing to bring word to Ned. Catelyn&#x27;s childhood friend, Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, implicates Tyrion Lannister, the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, in the assassination attempt. On the road back to Winterfell, Catelyn encounters Tyrion by chance, arrests him, and takes him to the Vale, where her sister Lysa Arryn is regent, to stand trial for the attempt on Bran&#x27;s life. In retaliation for Tyrion&#x27;s abduction, his father Lord Tywin Lannister sends soldiers to raid the Riverlands, Catelyn&#x27;s home region. Tyrion regains his freedom by recruiting a mercenary named Bronn to defend him in trial by combat.

Ned investigates Jon Arryn&#x27;s death and eventually discovers that Robert&#x27;s legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei&#x27;s children by Jaime (making Robert&#x27;s uncharismatic younger brother Stannis the rightful heir to the Iron Throne), and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of their incest. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert&#x27;s death in a hunting “accident” and install Joffrey on the throne. Ned prepares to send his daughters away from King&#x27;s Landing and enlists Littlefinger&#x27;s help to challenge Joffrey&#x27;s claim; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned&#x27;s arrest. Arya escapes the castle, but Sansa is taken hostage by the Lannisters.

Ned&#x27;s eldest son Robb marches his army south in response to his father&#x27;s arrest, and in order to relieve the threat on the riverlands. To secure a strategically necessary bridge crossing, Catelyn negotiates a marital alliance between Robb and the notoriously unreliable House Frey. Robb defeats a Lannister army in the Riverlands, capturing Jaime. Tywin sends Tyrion back to King&#x27;s Landing to act as Hand of the King to Joffrey. When Ned is executed, Robb&#x27;s followers declare the North&#x27;s independence from the Seven Kingdoms, proclaiming Robb &quot;King in the North&quot;.

===On the Wall===
The prologue of the novel introduces the Wall: an ancient barrier of stone, ice, and magic, hundreds of feet high and hundreds of miles long, shielding the Seven Kingdoms from the northern wilderness. The Wall is defended by the Night&#x27;s Watch: an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, defending the realm from the fabled Others, an ancient and hostile inhuman race, as well as from the human &quot;wildlings&quot; who live north of the Wall.

Jon Snow, Ned&#x27;s bastard son, is inspired by his uncle, Benjen Stark, to join the Night&#x27;s Watch, but becomes disillusioned when he discovers that its primary function is as a penal colony. Jon unites his fellow recruits against their harsh instructor and protects the cowardly but good-natured and intelligent Samwell Tarly. Jon is appointed steward to the leader of the Watch, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, making him a potential successor to Mormont. Benjen fails to return from an expedition north of the Wall. Six months later, the dead bodies of two men from his party are recovered; these re-animate as undead wights before being dispatched by Jon.

When word of his father&#x27;s execution reaches Jon, he attempts to join Robb against the Lannisters, but is persuaded to remain loyal to the Watch. Mormont then declares his intention to march north to find Benjen, dead or alive, and to investigate rumors of a &quot;King-beyond-the-Wall&quot; uniting the wildlings.

===Across the Narrow Sea===
Across the sea to the east of Westeros live the exiled prince Viserys and princess Daenerys, children of the late &quot;Mad King&quot; Aerys Targaryen, who ruled Westeros before being overthrown by Robert Baratheon. Viserys betroths Daenerys to Khal Drogo, a warlord of the nomadic Dothraki people, in exchange for the use of Drogo&#x27;s army to reclaim the throne of Westeros. Illyrio Mopatis, a wealthy merchant who has been supporting the penniless Targaryens, gives Daenerys three petrified dragon eggs as a wedding gift. Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled from Westeros, joins Viserys as an adviser. Initially terrified of her new husband and his people, Daenerys eventually embraces her role as Drogo&#x27;s &quot;khaleesi&quot;. Drogo, however, shows little interest in conquering Westeros, and an impatient Viserys tries to browbeat his sister into coercing Drogo. When Viserys publicly threatens Daenerys and her unborn child, Drogo executes him by pouring molten gold on his head.

An assassin seeking King Robert&#x27;s favor attempts to poison Daenerys, finally convincing Drogo to conquer Westeros. While sacking villages to fund the invasion of Westeros, Drogo is badly wounded, and Daenerys commands the captive folk healer Mirri Maz Duur to save him. The healer, angered by the Dothraki raids against her people, sacrifices Daenerys&#x27;s unborn child to power the spell to save Drogo&#x27;s life, which restores Drogo&#x27;s physical health but leaves him in a persistent vegetative state.

With Drogo completely incapacitated and unable to lead, much of the Dothraki army disperses. Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow and has Mirri tied to Drogo&#x27;s funeral pyre. She places her three dragon eggs on the pyre and enters it herself. When the fire burns out, she emerges unharmed, with three newly hatched dragons. Awe-struck, Jorah and the remaining Dothraki swear allegiance to her.

==Point of view Characters==
Each chapter concentrates on the third-person limited point of view of a single character; the book presents the perspective of eight main characters. Additionally, a minor character provides the prologue. Chapter headings indicate the perspective.
* Prologue: Will, a man of the Night&#x27;s Watch.
* Lord Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, Warden of the North and Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King.
* Lady Catelyn Stark, of House Tully, wife of Eddard Stark.
* Sansa Stark, elder daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark.
* Arya Stark, younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark.
* Bran Stark, middle son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark.
* Jon Snow, illegitimate son of Eddard Stark.
* Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf, brother of the twins Queen Cersei and Jaime, son of Lord Tywin Lannister.
* Princess Daenerys Targaryen, exiled daughter of the former king Aerys and sister of Aerys&#x27;s heir Viserys.

In the later books, certain viewpoint characters are added while others are removed.

==Themes==
Throughout the novel, characters are often faced with decisions that match one redeemable trait against another. &quot;The Guardian&quot; outlines characters who are frequently &quot;forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm.&quot; In Westeros, Ned ultimately decides to venture south with Robert, leaving much of his family in Winterfell. At the Wall, Jon wrestles with the predicament of joining his half-brother Robb in rebellion or staying with his sworn brothers in the Night&#x27;s Watch. Daenerys has issue with the Dothraki treatment of those they conquered in Essos. These conflicts characters encounter oftentimes reflect inconsistent decision making. Catelyn initially is overwhelmed by grief and does not leave Bran&#x27;s bedside while he is comatose, ignoring her political responsibilities, choosing family over duty. But soon after, Catelyn leaves Bran and her family for King&#x27;s Landing to inform Ned of potential Lannister treason, effectively displaying a more duty fulfilling role. Family, duty, and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc, and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution. Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy.

Martin characteristically deviates from the traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: &quot;I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It&#x27;s not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they&#x27;re really ugly&quot;. This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks&#x27; and Lannisters&#x27; conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys&#x27; storyline develops around the Targaryen&#x27;s upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role. Martin argues: Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters. You have to be able to see the struggle from both sides, because real human beings in a war have all these processes of self-justification, telling ourselves why what we&#x27;re doing is the right thing.

==Writing==
Martin acknowledges several authors who lent their time and expertise during the writing of the novel: Sage Walker, Martin Wright, Melinda Snodgrass, Carl Keim, Bruce Baugh, Tim O&#x27;Brien, Roger Zelazny, Jane Lindskold, and Laura Mixon.

==Editions==

The HarperCollins/Voyager 1996 edition was the British first edition. Its official publication date was earlier than that of the US Bantam edition, but Bantam went to print several months earlier to hand out copies at the American Booksellers Association (ABA). The novel has been translated into many languages and published in multiple editions in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audio book form. In different languages, the number of books may not be the same. For Example, for the German Paperback Editions published by Blanvalet and later Penhaligon, the book and the other novels of the series were split in two. In June 2000, Meisha Merlin published a limited edition of the book, fully illustrated by Jeffrey Jones.

==Adaptations==

&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and the subsequent novels in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series have been adapted into an HBO television series, a comic book series, several card games, board games, video games, and other media.

==Reception==
&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; has received critical acclaim. Lauren K. Nathan of the Associated Press wrote that the book &quot;grip[s] the reader from Page One&quot; and is set in a &quot;magnificent&quot; fantasy world that is &quot;mystical, but still believable.&quot; Steve Perry told readers of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; that the plot is &quot;complex and fascinating&quot; and the book is &quot;rich and colorful&quot; with &quot;all the elements of a great fantasy novel&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, John H. Riskind commented that &quot;many fans of sword-and-sorcery will enjoy the epic scope of this book&quot; but felt that the book &quot;suffers from one-dimensional characters and less than memorable imagery.&quot; Phyllis Eisenstein of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that, although the book uses many generic fantasy tropes, Martin&#x27;s approach is &quot;so refreshingly human and intimate that it transcends them.&quot; She described it as &quot;an absorbing combination of the mythic, the sweepingly historical, and the intensely personal.&quot; John Prior, writing in the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, called Martin&#x27;s writing &quot;strong and imaginative, with plenty of Byzantine intrigue and dynastic struggle&quot;, and compared it to Robert Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; books, &quot;though much darker, with no comedy or romance to relieve the nastiness.&quot;

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="713578" wikidata="Q7968990" url="?curid=713578" title="Ward Connerly">
<text>Wardell Anthony &quot;Ward&quot; Connerly (born June 15, 1939) is an American political and anti-affirmative action activist, businessman, and former University of California Regent (1993–2005). He is also the founder and the chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, a national non-profit organization in opposition to racial and gender preferences, and is the president of Californians for Equal Rights, a non-profit organization active in the state of California with a similar mission. He is considered to be the man behind California&#x27;s Proposition 209 prohibiting race- and gender-based preferences in state hiring, contracting and state university admissions, a program known as affirmative action.

==Early life==
Wardell Anthony Connerly was born in Leesville, Louisiana, in 1939. Connerly has said that he is one-fourth black and half-white, with the rest a mix of Irish, French, and Choctaw American Indian. He identifies as multiracial. He grew up in an African-American community, but the children met some discrimination in school because of their light skin. In a Louisiana state census, the family were classified as &quot;colored&quot;, a category that historically covered the Louisiana Creole people (other categories were negro and white).
His father, Roy Connerly, left the household when Ward was 2, and his mother died when he was 4. The young Connerly lived first with Bertha and James Louis, his maternal aunt and uncle. They moved to Bremerton, Washington and then to Sacramento, California, as part of the Great Migration by millions of blacks out of the South in the first half of the 20th century to seek better opportunities. Connerly next lived with his maternal grandmother, Mary Smith Soneia, who had also moved to Sacramento. (She was the daughter of a Choctaw man and white woman, and she had married a Cajun of mixed heritage.) When she had difficulty supporting the two of them, Ward took many jobs as a boy.

Connerly attended Sacramento State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts with honors in political science in 1962. While in college, Connerly was student body president, was active as a Young Democrat, and joined Delta Phi Omega, a white fraternity. Later he was made an honorary member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. During his college years, Connerly campaigned against housing discrimination and helped to get a bill passed by the state legislature banning the practice.

==Marriage and family==
Since 1962, Connerly has been married to Ilene Crews, a woman of European-American descent, whom he started dating in college. They have two children. She is his equal partner in the firm of Connerly &amp; Associates.

In addition to his political activities, Connerly is a member of the Rotary Club of Sacramento, California.

==Career==
After college, Connerly worked for a number of state agencies and Assembly committees, where he developed a broad range of contacts. He worked for the Sacramento re-development agency, the state department of housing and urban development, and the State Assembly committee on urban affairs. During the late 1960s, Connerly became friends with then-legislator Pete Wilson (who would become governor in 1991).

Encouraged by Wilson, Connerly left his government job in 1973. He started his own consulting and land-use planning company, known as Connerly and Associates, Inc., and together with his wife as partner, made a strong success of it.

In 1993 he was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents, where he served until March 2005. During this time, he became deeply involved in working to repeal state affirmative action programs.

==Campaign against racial preferences==
After his appointment to the University of California board of regents in 1993, Connerly began to learn more about the workings of its affirmative action program. In 1994, he heard from Jerry and Ellan Cook, whose son had been rejected at the University of California, San Francisco (UC) Medical School. Connerly became convinced that affirmative action, as practiced by UC, was another kind of racial discrimination. Cook, a statistician, had presented data showing that white and Asian students were being denied admission despite having better grades and test scores than other students who were being admitted. Connerly proposed abolishing the controversial racially based programs, while allowing the university to consider social or economic factors. The regents passed the proposal in January 1996 despite protests from activist Jesse Jackson and other supporters of affirmative action. The year after affirmative action was abolished, the number of Asian students admitted to UC increased markedly.

The UC regents developed a new system, including essay requirements that served to reveal the applicant&#x27;s race and ethnicity. The new measures, titled &quot;comprehensive review&quot; have not yet been challenged to the California Supreme Court or the Supreme Court of the United States.

In 1995, Connerly became the chairman of the California Civil Rights Initiative Campaign and helped get the initiative on the California ballot as Proposition 209. The Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundations, the ACLU, and the California Teachers Association opposed the measure. It passed with 54.6% of the vote.

In 1997, Connerly formed the American Civil Rights Institute. ACRI supported a similar ballot measure in Washington state, Initiative 200, which would later pass with 58.2% of the vote. Connerly had a salary of $314,079 combined from the ACRI and American Civil Rights Coalition in addition to over $400,000 in speaking and consulting fees in 2002; nearly half of his salary reimbursed his Connerly &amp; Associates land and housing consulting firm.

ACRI worked to get a measure on the ballot in the 2000 Florida election. The Florida Supreme Court put restrictions on the petition language. Though Governor Jeb Bush, like the previous governor, opposed the petition as a public initiative, Bush sympathized with its key goals. Bush eventually proposed a program &quot;One Florida&quot; which implemented key portions of Connerly&#x27;s proposal.

In 2003, Connerly helped place Proposition 54 on the California ballot, which would prohibit the government from classifying any person by race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, with some exceptions, such as for medical research. Critics were concerned that such a measure would make it difficult to track housing discrimination and racial profiling activities. Editorials in newspapers such as the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the measure, saying that the lack of such information would hamper legitimate medical and scientific purposes. The voters did not pass the measure.

In 2003 the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action programs at the University of Michigan in &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot; and &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;; it ruled the undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it applied the program, but that the process at the University of Michigan law school could continue. Jennifer Gratz invited Connerly to Michigan to support a referendum measure similar to the 1996 California amendment. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative appeared on the November 2006 Michigan ballot and was passed 58% to 42%.

For the 2008 elections, Connerly headed a campaign which he called &quot;Super Tuesday for Equal Rights&quot;. It was directed at dismantling affirmative action programs in five different states via ballot measures. In three of the states, Connerly&#x27;s initiatives failed to make it onto the ballot. In Colorado, voters rejected Amendment 46 (or the Colorado Civil Rights Initiative) by a very slim margin. Voters in Nebraska were the only ones to approve a new anti-affirmative action measure, called Initiative 424.

For the 2020 election, Connerly organized the coalition opposing Proposition 16, which would have removed the sections added to the California constitution after Proposition 209 was approved by the voters in 1996. A victory for Proposition 16 would make it legal for the state to give preferences and discriminate based on protected classes like race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. 57% of the votes cast in the election opposed Proposition 16, and it failed to pass. The 57.2% vote against Proposition 16, implies that more Californians support race neutrality than they did in 1996, when Proposition 209 passed with 54.6% votes.

==Political views==
===Party identification===
Ward Connerly identifies as a Republican with a libertarian philosophy. In January 2008, Connerly endorsed Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani.

===Support for domestic partnership benefits===
Despite his close political relationship with former California Governor Pete Wilson, and their agreement on the question of affirmative action, Connerly led efforts to grant domestic partner benefits to gay and lesbian domestic partners in all state universities over Wilson&#x27;s objections. The UC Regents narrowly passed the initiative.

Connerly says his views on gay rights stem from his libertarian viewpoint that governments, including government-run universities, should not discriminate, whether it is by favoring some students because of their race, or by excluding others from spousal benefits based on their sexual orientation.

The conservative advocacy groups Family Research Council and Traditional Values Coalition criticized Connerly&#x27;s support for domestic partner benefits. In reference to Connerly, Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council, said, &quot;no true conservative would equate homosexual households with marriages, because we believe that without marriage and family as paramount values, hell will break loose.&quot;

===Support of same-sex marriage===
In response to Proposition 8 on California&#x27;s November 2008 ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in California, Connerly stated, &quot;For anyone to say that this is an issue for people who are gay and that this isn&#x27;t about civil rights is sadly mistaken. If you really believe in freedom and limited government, to be intellectually consistent and honest you have to oppose efforts of the majority to impose their will on people.&quot;

===Support of multi-racial category on government forms===
On July 9, 1997, the American Civil Rights Institute expressed disappointment with the federal government&#x27;s decision to reject the addition of a multi-racial category on the Census and other government forms that collect racial data. Since 2000, the Census Bureau has allowed individuals to identify more than one racial/ethnic category on the census form, although it does not yet have a multiracial category.

Connerly began to ally with prominent members of what has become known as the multiracial movement. Prior to leading the Racial Privacy Initiative (Proposition 54) in California, Connerly forged ties with the publishers of &quot;Interracial Voice&quot; and &quot;The Multiracial Activist&quot;, prominent publications for the multiracial movement. Eventually, Connerly enlisted the help of several outspoken members of the multiracial movement to assist with the campaign for the Racial Privacy Initiative.

==Reception==
===Personal===
In 1995, then California State Senator (and later congresswoman) Diane Watson said about Connerly, &quot;He&#x27;s married to a white woman. He wants to be white. He wants a colorless society. He has no ethnic pride. He doesn&#x27;t want to be black.&quot; Jeff Jacoby, a columnist for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, characterized this attack as part of the personal abuse conservative blacks received from liberal blacks who opposed their programs.
After Connerly published his autobiography, &quot;Creating Equal: My Fight Against Race Preferences&quot; in 2000, some relatives claimed his accounts of an impoverished childhood were exaggerated or false. Connerly&#x27;s aunt Bertha Louis, whom he had lived with and who was close to his grandmother, confirmed his account and said his detractors &quot;are just lyin&#x27; on him. It&#x27;s jealousy and it&#x27;s hatred, as low as you can get.&quot;

===Affirmative action and desegregation===
Asked in 2003 if Proposition 54 could derail school integration efforts in California, Connerly said: &quot;I don&#x27;t care whether they are segregated or not… kids need to be learning, and I place more value on these kids getting educated than I do on whether we have some racial balancing or not.&quot;

Connerly&#x27;s opposition to affirmative action has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action is a form of racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.

In 1995, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that as CEO of Connerly &amp; Associates, Inc., Connerly benefited financially from state affirmative action programs in contracting.

BAMN opposed Connerly&#x27;s efforts to put the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative on the 2006 Michigan Ballot, and disrupted a Michigan Board of Canvassers meeting that year in protest.

In relation to &quot;Attacking Affirmative Action&quot;, a program on &quot;Now on PBS&quot; in August 2008, Connerly said,
I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it&#x27;s no longer a case of equal opportunity. It&#x27;s a case of putting a fist on the scale.

<text>A Clash of Kings is the second of seven planned novels in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by American author George R. R. Martin, an epic fantasy series. It was first published in the United Kingdom on November 16, 1998; the first United States edition followed on February 2, 1999. Like its predecessor, &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, it won the Locus Award (in 1999) for Best Novel and was nominated for the Nebula Award (also in 1999) for Best Novel. In May 2005, Meisha Merlin released a limited edition of the novel, fully illustrated by John Howe.

The novel has been adapted for television as the second season of the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is also the name of the first expansion to the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; board game.

==Plot==
&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; depicts the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in civil war, while the Night&#x27;s Watch mounts a reconnaissance to investigate the mysterious people known as wildlings. Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen continues her plan to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.

===In the Seven Kingdoms===
With King Robert Baratheon dead, his purported son Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne. His reign is far from stable, as both of Robert&#x27;s brothers, Renly and Stannis, have claimed the throne as well. Two regions attempt to secede from the realm: Robb Stark is declared &quot;King in the North&quot; while Balon Greyjoy declares himself king of the Iron Islands. The war among these contenders is dubbed the War of the Five Kings.

Stannis Baratheon, publicizing the claim that Joffrey and his siblings are bastards, claims the throne as Robert&#x27;s eldest brother and therefore heir. He is supported by Melisandre, a foreign priestess who believes Stannis a prophesied messianic figure. Renly is supported by the wealthy Lord Mace Tyrell, and has married Mace&#x27;s daughter Margaery. Robb&#x27;s mother Catelyn Stark meets with Renly and Stannis to discuss an alliance against Joffrey&#x27;s family, the Lannisters, but she is unable to reach an agreement with them. Melisandre uses magic to send a shadow to assassinate Renly in the middle of the night, and Stannis besieges Storm’s End, Renly’s castle; after witnessing Renly&#x27;s death, Catelyn and Renly&#x27;s bodyguard, Brienne of Tarth, flee the scene.

Tyrion Lannister, Joffrey&#x27;s uncle, arrives at the capital city of King&#x27;s Landing as acting Hand of the King, the senior adviser to Joffrey&#x27;s reign. Tyrion improves the defenses of the city while jockeying for power against Joffrey&#x27;s mother, the Queen Regent Cersei. Learning of Renly&#x27;s death, Tyrion sends the crown&#x27;s treasurer Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish to win the Tyrells&#x27; support for Joffrey. Catelyn&#x27;s daughter Sansa, a hostage of the Lannisters, is regularly abused by Joffrey. Riots break out in the city due to Joffrey&#x27;s cruelty and food shortages caused by the ongoing war.

Robb wins several victories against the Lannisters while his younger brother Bran rules the Northern stronghold of Winterfell in his absence. Against Catelyn&#x27;s advice, Robb sends his friend Theon Greyjoy, Balon Greyjoy&#x27;s son, to negotiate an alliance between the North and the Iron Islands. Theon betrays Robb and attacks Winterfell, taking the castle and capturing Bran and his younger brother Rickon. When Bran and Rickon escape, Theon fakes their deaths. Stark supporters besiege the castle, including a force from the Starks&#x27; sometime ally House Bolton. However, the Bolton soldiers turn against the Stark and Greyjoy forces alike, burn Winterfell, slaughter its inhabitants, and take Theon prisoner.

Catelyn&#x27;s daughter Arya is taken north posing as a new recruit for the Night&#x27;s Watch. The recruits are attacked by Lannister forces, and the survivors are taken to the gigantic castle of Harrenhal, which is controlled by Joffrey&#x27;s grandfather Tywin Lannister. For saving his life during the attack, a mysterious man named Jaqen H&#x27;ghar promises to repay Arya by killing three men of her choice. Arya leverages this offer to help Northern forces retake control of Harrenhal. Jaqen gives Arya a mysterious iron coin and tells her to find him in the foreign city of Braavos if she should ever desire to learn his secrets. Arya soon escapes the castle.

Stannis&#x27;s army launches an amphibious assault on King&#x27;s Landing in a battle on Blackwater Bay. Under Tyrion&#x27;s command, the Lannister forces use &quot;wildfire&quot; (a substance similar to Greek fire) to ignite the bay, and raise a massive chain across its mouth to prevent Stannis&#x27; fleet from retreating. When Stannis&#x27;s troops storm the gates, it falls to Tyrion to lead the Lannister troops into battle. Stannis&#x27;s victory seems to be assured, until Tywin Lannister arrives with his army and the Tyrell forces, defeating Stannis. During the battle, Tyrion is attacked and injured by a knight of Joffrey&#x27;s Kingsguard; by the time Tyrion regains consciousness after the battle, Tywin has assumed the post of Hand of the King.

===Beyond the Wall===
A scouting party from the Night&#x27;s Watch learns that the wildlings are uniting under &quot;King-beyond-the-Wall&quot; Mance Rayder. The Lord Commander of the Watch, Jeor Mormont, assigns Jon Snow to a group sent to investigate Mance&#x27;s aims, led by Qhorin Halfhand. Hunted by wildling warriors and facing certain defeat, Halfhand commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans. To win the wildlings&#x27; trust, Jon is forced to kill Qhorin. He learns that Mance Rayder is advancing towards the Wall that separates the wildlings from the Seven Kingdoms with an army of thirty thousand wildlings, giants, and mammoths.

===Across the Narrow Sea===
Daenerys Targaryen travels south, accompanied by the knight Jorah Mormont, her remaining followers, and three newly hatched dragons. At the city of Qarth, Daenerys&#x27;s dragons make her notorious. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a prominent trader in Qarth, initially befriends her; but Daenerys cannot secure aid because she refuses to give away any of her dragons. As a last resort, Daenerys seeks counsel from the warlocks of Qarth, who show Daenerys many confusing visions and threaten her life, whereupon one of Daenerys&#x27; dragons burns down the warlocks&#x27; House of the Undying. An attempt to assassinate Daenerys is thwarted by a warrior named Strong Belwas and his squire Arstan Whitebeard: agents of Daenerys&#x27; ally Illyrio Mopatis, who have come to escort her back to Pentos.

==Television adaptation==
&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; has been adapted for television by HBO as the second season of its successful adaptation of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. Filming began July 2011, and the first episode of season 2 of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; aired on April 1, 2012.

==Reception==
As with its predecessor, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; was positively received by critics. Dorman Shindler of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; described it as &quot;one of the best [works] in this particular subgenre&quot;, praising &quot;the richness of this invented world and its cultures ... [that] lends Mr. Martin&#x27;s novels the feeling of medieval history rather than fiction.&quot; Writing in &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, Jim Hopper called &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; &quot;High Fantasy with a vengeance&quot; and commented: &quot;I&#x27;ll admit to staying up too late one night last week to finish off this big book, and I hope it&#x27;s not too terribly long until the next one comes out.&quot; Danielle Pilon wrote in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; that the book &quot;shows no signs of the usual &#x27;middle book&#x27; aimlessness&quot;. Although she found the constantly switching viewpoints &quot;momentarily confusing&quot;, she felt that it &quot;draws the reader deep into the labyrinthine political and military intrigues and evokes sympathy for characters on all sides of the conflict.&quot; Bradley H. Sinor of the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; praised Martin for &quot;keep[ing] readers balanced on a sword&#x27;s edge&quot; and managing to do &quot;three important things&quot; with &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;: &quot;It grips the reader whether or not they read the earlier book, tells a satisfying story and leaves the reader wanting the next book as soon as possible.&quot; &quot;The Oregonian&quot;″s Steve Perry called the book &quot;easily as good as the first novel&quot; and commented that the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; books were &quot;so complex, fascinating and well-rendered that readers will almost certainly be hooked into the whole series.&quot; However, he cautioned that &quot;if it were a movie, it would be rated &quot;R&quot; for sex and violence, so don&#x27;t pick the book up for your 10-year-old nephew who likes Conan.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
* Locus Award – Best Novel (Fantasy) (Won) – (1999)
* Nebula Award – Best Novel (Nominated) – (1999)
* Ignotus Award – Best Novel (Foreign) (Won) – (2004)

<text>The Bach family is a family of notable composers of the baroque and classical periods of music, the best-known of whom was Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750). A family genealogy was drawn up by Johann Sebastian Bach himself in 1735 when he was 50 and was continued by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel.

==Descendants of Johann Sebastian Bach==
Of the seven children that Johann Sebastian Bach had with his first wife Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin, four survived into adulthood: Catharina Dorothea Bach (1708–1774); Wilhelm Friedemann; Carl Philipp Emanuel (the &quot;Berlin Bach&quot;, later the &quot;Hamburg Bach&quot;); and Johann Gottfried Bernhard. All four were musically talented, and Wilhelm Friedeman and Carl Philipp Emanuel had significant musical careers of their own.

After his first wife died, Johann Sebastian Bach married Anna Magdalena Wilcken, a gifted soprano and daughter of the court trumpeter of Prince Saxe-Weissenfels. They had 13 children, of whom Johann Christoph Friedrich (the &quot;Bückeburg Bach&quot;) and Johann Christian (the &quot;London Bach&quot;) became significant musicians. A further four survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726–1781), who married Bach&#x27;s pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol; Johanna Carolina (1737–1781); and Regina Susanna (1742–1809).

Of Bach&#x27;s surviving children, only five married. Of these, Johann Christian had no children from his marriage to the soprano Cecilia Grassi. Carl Philipp Emanuel, who married Johanna Maria Dannemann, had three surviving children. Of these children the youngest, Johann Sebastian (1748–1778) was a gifted painter who died young. None of Emanuel&#x27;s children married or had offspring, with his bloodline dying out with the death of his daughter Anna Carolina Philippina (1746–1804).

Elisabeth Juliane Friederica, known as Liesgen, with Altnickol had three surviving children. Their only son, Johann Sebastian, died in infancy in 1740. The elder daughter, Augusta Magdalena (1751–1809) married Ernest Friedrich Ahlefeldt and had four daughters, of whom only one, Christiane Johanne (1780–1816) survived. From her marriage to Paul Johann Müller, a daughter, Augusta Wilhelmina (1809–1818) was born, though she died as an infant, ending this line of Bach&#x27;s descendants.

Of the next generation, Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach, also known as William Bach (24 May 1759 – 25 December 1845) was the eldest son of Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach and the only grandson of Johann Sebastian Bach to gain fame as a composer. He was music director to Frederick William II of Prussia. WFE&#x27;s only son died in infancy. The first born of his three daughters, Caroline Augusta Wilhelmine, lived the longest. She died in 1871 – the last of Bach&#x27;s descendants to hold the Bach name.

Bach has living descendants via two granddaughters born to Friedemann and Johann Christoph Friedrich, respectively. Anna Philippine Friederike (1755–1804), sister of Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst, married Wilhelm Ernst Colson, a lieutenant in an artillery regiment. They had five sons and a daughter. Whereas this bloodline was traditionally assumed to have died out with this generation, one of her sons, Johann Christoph Friedrich (1778–1831) married and had offspring with progeny to the modern day.

Friedemann married Dorothea Elisabeth Georgi and had two sons and a daughter. Both sons died in infancy. During the 20th-century scholarship has uncovered several children born to his daughter Friederica Sophia (b. 1757), which were hitherto unknown. Friederica Sophia married Johann Schmidt, a foot soldier, in 1793 shortly after the birth of an illegitimate daughter. Of this child and a sister little is known. In 1780 she had given birth to an illegitimate son, of which nothing further is known. Friederica Sophia appears to have left her husband for a man by the name of Schwarzschulz, with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Karoline Beata (b. 1798), whose descendants eventually emigrated to Oklahoma.

<text>The Injustice Society (a.k.a. the Injustice Society of the World) is a group of supervillains in the . They are the main antagonists of the Justice Society of America.

The Injustice Society first appears in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #37 (Oct 1947) and was created by Sheldon Mayer and Bob Kanigher. The original group brought together six popular villains from &quot;Flash Comics&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;All Star Comics&quot;: Thinker, Gambler, Vandal Savage, Wizard, Per Degaton, and Brain Wave.

The Injustice Society appear on the DC Universe and CW show &quot;Stargirl&quot; as the main antagonists of the first season, with some members also appearing in its second season.

==Fictional team history==
===Golden Age===
====The Wizard&#x27;s Injustice Society====
It is unknown under what circumstances the Injustice Society was formed. The group first appeared in the second half of the 1940s where they were led by the Wizard and planned to take over America. Fragmenting into individual efforts, the ISW launched strikes against government facilities around the nation, each with his own private army of convicts due to five jailbreaks engineered by the ISW. In addition to furthering their primary aims, the villains were each assigned to capture a member of the JSA in anticipated resistance. To ensure that the JSA showed up, the villains notified the heroes of their plans. In due course, Hawkman was captured by Vandal Savage at an airport which the criminal army had surrounded. Doctor Mid-Nite was apprehended by Per Degaton who was attacking the Washington Monument. The Flash fell victim to his long-time foe the Thinker at the Governor&#x27;s house where the Thinker was broadcasting fake demands by the Governor to make the armed forces stand down due to invisible wires. The Atom was snared by the Gambler. Green Lantern arrives in Uthorium Town just as the armed forces are closing in on the criminals that control the city. Suddenly, the town disappears in a flash of light. Green Lantern begins a search for the criminal army when he discovers the town has re-appeared a few miles away, and the felons are looting uthorium from a lab. Green Lantern zooms in for the attack when Brainwave appears on the scene, opening a canister of uthorium in his presence. Blinded, Green Lantern forms an energy bubble for protection while Brainwave and his men finish their job. Recovering later, Green Lantern discovers a radioactive trail left behind by the uthorium and follows it, discovering some of the thugs with an invention called the &quot;Mirage-Thrower,&quot; which fools the Army tanks into crossing a frozen lake which really isn&#x27;t frozen. Green Lantern saves the tanks and men, then follows the trail to discover Brainwave inside a weird glass box. Firing his power ring at it, the ray bounces back, knocking Green Lantern off a cliff, apparently to his death. Hearing of Per Degaton&#x27;s capture of Doctor Mid-Nite in Capital City (evidently meant to be based on Washington), Wonder Woman and Johnny Thunder left JSA headquarters to intervene, only to be captured themselves. The JSA were held by a will-deadener beam, put on &quot;trial&quot; before Judge Thinker with the Wizard as Prosecutor. The JSA were sentenced to death, but it was then revealed Green Lantern had disguised himself as the Thinker. His ring saved him at the last moment and he captured the Thinker. He freed the others and they defeated the Injustice Society, with the Wizard being caught by a group of children who idolized the Justice Society called the Junior Justice Society.

====Second Injustice Society====
The second formation appeared in the late 1940s attempting &quot;patriotic crimes&quot; where it was formed by Wizard and consisted of Fiddler, Harlequin, Huntress, Icicle, and Sportsmaster. They stole national monuments, hoping the American people would vote for the best crime allowing that person to become the leader, and succeeding in erasing the Society&#x27;s memories after capturing them by the Sportsmaster knocking them out with one of his bombs, but Harlequin turned against them and with Black Canary restored the Justice Society&#x27;s memories, though a post-hypnotic impulse restores the JSA to their mindless states when they hear fingers snapping, causing them to be recaptured. But their memories are restored again after they are placed in a death chamber, leading to Black Canary becoming a proper member.

===Silver Age===
The Injustice Society reforms during the 1970s to try and eliminate the reformed Justice Society in 2 instances. The first attempt is during the annual JLA/JSA team-ups where the Wizard (leader), alongside Sportsmaster, Huntress, Gambler, Shade, and Icicle hypnotize Earth-Prime&#x27;s Cary Bates into working alongside them as a villain after he accidentally arrives on Earth-Two after stepping on Flash&#x27;s Cosmic Treadmill left behind by Earth-One&#x27;s Flash when he visited there. It took Elliot S. Maggin and the JLA to find him after Elliot went to Earth-One to ask the JLA members Batman, Aquaman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Flash, and Hawkman to help him find Cary. The JLA was defeated by the Injustice Society at first because they were tricked into &quot;killing&quot; JSA members Robin, Wonder Woman, Wildcat, Johnny Thunder, Hourman and Doctor Mid-Nite disguised as the Injustice Society after the JSA was defeated by Cary. It took the Spectre to revive the JSA using his Ring of Life and the JLA removing the mental block they received after the JSA deaths to defeat Cary and the Injustice sSciety and send Cary and Elliot home back to Earth-Prime, with the JSA taking the Injustice Society back to prison on Earth-Two. The second attempt happens on Earth-Two itself. First, the Fiddler fetches Solomon Grundy and defeats Wildcat and Hawkman, but they are defeated by Superman of Earth-Two and Power Girl.

Vandal Savage tricks the JSA into aiding a false Camelot while Icicle, Thinker, Wizard, and Brainwave capture Wildcat and the Hourman. The Thinker and the Icicle are defeated by Doctor Fate, Hawkman, and Jay Garrick, while the Wizard and Brainwave are defeated by Power Girl and the Star-Spangled Kid. The Wizard then left the Injustice Society for Earth-One, where he joined the Secret Society of Super-Villains.

Brain Wave captures Green Lantern, Jay Garrick, and Power Girl before being defeated in Power Girl&#x27;s first solo adventure. The Psycho Pirate is the final member of the Society after he brainwashes GCPD Police Commissioner Bruce Wayne into believing the JSA&#x27;s recent actions, including Green Lantern(under his influence as well before the JSA defeats the Pirate)&#x27;s was the result of them going rogue. This leads Wayne to summon via Robin&#x27;s JSA signaller Wonder Woman, Hourman, and Starman to fight the so-called rogue JSA members Power Girl, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern, Star Spangled Kid and Dr Fate, during which Power Girl was severely injured(and later recovered) by Wayne&#x27;s actions. It took Fate using a spell on Wayne to shatter The Pirate&#x27;s hold on him as The Pirate was imprisoned once more prior to this battle, as well as Superman appearing to end the battle between young and old JSA members.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
====Injustice Unlimited====
During what some described as the &quot;anti-costumed-hero mania&quot; (as chronicled in the DC miniseries &quot;Legends&quot;) in the pages of &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot;, the Wizard gathered both old comrades (consisting of Brainwave, the Fiddler, Gambler, Harlequin, Per Degaton, Shade, Solomon Grundy, Sportsmaster, Thinker, and Vandal Savage) and new super-criminals (consisting of Hazard, the Icicle II, and the Tigress III) into a new Injustice Society, which he called &quot;Injustice Unlimited&quot;. Infinity, Inc. fought Injustice Unlimited, which led to the apparent death of the Wizard. Indeed, the criminal group seemed to be a mirror image of Infinity, Inc., which itself was an offshoot of the Justice Society, at the time when the group was led by the Dummy. Later, this team returned to the original name.

====Johnny Sorrow&#x27;s Injustice Society====
Johnny Sorrow appears in late 1999 as the leader of the new Injustice Society (consisting of Icicle II, Blackbriar Thorn, Count Vertigo, Geomancer, Killer Wasp, and Tigress III). Together they storm the headquarters of superhero team Justice Society of America, although JSA member Wildcat defeats them all (destroying Blackbriar Thorn) despite still recovering from a broken arm and the attack initially being launched while he was in the bathtub, with the exception of Sorrow, who uses the diversion to steal an unknown artifact.

Sorrow returns with a larger version of the Injustice Society (having also recruited Black Adam after removing a brain tumour, Shiv, Rival, and the Thinker A.I.) to distract the JSA while he summoned the King of Tears, an other-dimensional entity. However, the JSA were able to fend off the Society, including killing the Rival and Black Adam defecting, with the fight culminating in the Flash drawing on Black Adam&#x27;s speed to send the King of Tears to another dimension by striking him at near-lightspeed.

====The Wizard&#x27;s second Injustice Society====
The demon Legacy (actually Wizard in disguise) formed another version in the miniseries &quot;JSA All-Stars&quot;. The lineup consists of Icicle II, Rival, Shiv, and Tigress III. The new team again confronted the JSA. Unknown to the JSA, their job was just to stick teleportation discs to the old-timers. Legacy then teleported his successful team away. Legacy is then later &quot;killed&quot; by the Spectre.

====Johnny Sorrow&#x27;s Injustice Society====
The Injustice Society resurfaced again in November 2005, in the pages of &quot;JSA Classified&quot;. The soul of the Wizard joined forces with Johnny Sorrow where they gathered a new incarnation of the Injustice Society consisting of the Gentleman Ghost, Icicle II, Rag Doll I, Solomon Grundy, the Thinker A.I., and Tigress III. They were tasked to steal Prometheus&#x27; Cosmic Key from JSA headquarters in order to free the Wizard and Johnny Sorrow. While noting to himself that the Rag Doll I would betray the group, the Wizard sets him up to take the fall. The Injustice Society tried to enlist the Secret Society of Super Villains to help with the caper, which drew the attention of Talia al Ghul. Rag Doll I took the Cosmic Key as Wizard had predicted and was killed when he activated it. Once Johnny Sorrow was brought back to Earth, he and the Injustice Society teleported to Prometheus&#x27; Crooked House. When it was discovered that Tigress III and Icicle II had started to fall in love with each other, Johnny Sorrow strong-armed them into sticking around.

Another plot was to kidnap Stargirl and to face off against the JSA All Stars. The line-up here consists of Johnny Sorrow, Tigress III, Icicle II, Wizard, Killer Wasp, Geomancer II, and Shiv.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Hawkman and Hawkgirl recount their time with the Justice Society and the day that they fought the Injustice Society. In the flashback to the 1940s when the Justice Society stormed the Injustice Society&#x27;s fortress in Austria, Hawkman fought Per Degaton, Hawkgirl fought Vandal Savage, Green Lantern fought the Wizard, the Sandman fought the Gambler, Wildcat fought the Tigress, and the Flash fought Brain Wave. After Brain Wave unleashes a powerful psychic attack that knocks everyone down, Per Degaton and Vandal Savage prepare to finish off Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Hawkman and Hawkgirl throw their maces enough for them to collide. This enables the Justice Society to turn the tables against the Injustice Society. Green Lantern then makes an airplane construct so that the Justice Society can deliver the Injustice Society to the authorities.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, it was mentioned that Doctor Elemental and his creation Ro-Bear had an association with the JSA at some point.

===&quot;DC All In&quot;===
In the &quot;DC All In&quot; initiative, a new incarnation of the Injustice Society appears. It is led by Scandal Savage and consists of Doctor Elemental, Fog, Gentleman Ghost, Johnny Sorrow (who was impersonating Obsidian), Lady Eve, Red Lantern II, Shadow Thief, Solomon Grundy, and Wotan. One week ago, Scandal Savage led Injustice Society members Red Lantern, Shadow Thief, and Solomon Grundy in ambushing Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Hawkman while Obsidian works to keep Khalid Nassour and Jakeem Thunder safe. Gentleman Ghost snuck up on Jakeem to keep him from summoning Johnny Thunderbolt while Johnny Sorrow grabbed Khalid&#x27;s hand before he can grab the Helmet of Fate. Wotan showed up to keep Johnny Sorrow from removing his mask as they need Khalid alive. Wotan then grabs the Helmet of Fate before being tackled by Obsidian. Due to a combination of Wotan and Doctor Fate&#x27;s spells, everyone but Obsidian and Jakeem were transported to Hell alongside the Tower of Fate. Back in the present as the other JSA members fight the demons, Jay is ambushed at the exit to the Brownstone by Doctor Elemental, Red Lantern, and Solomon Grundy as they begin to look for Doctor Fate. While Wotan has gotten control of the Demons Three at the time when they caught Hawkman, Doctor Elemental, Fog, Red Lantern, and Solomon Grundy demand that Flash leads them to Doctor Fate so that they can claim the Helmet of Fate. Flash tries to get answers out of Red Lantern and Solomon Grundy on why they are with the Injustice Society. Doctor Fate ends up coming to them as he frees Flash from the villains and uses a spell to send the villains out of the Tower of Fate. At the same time after figuring out what is keeping Jakeem Thunder in a coma, Doctor Mid-Nite is confronted by Johnny Sorrow in the form of Obsidian and figures out that Obsidian is an imposter. Before Johnny Sorrow can remove his mask upon returning to his true form, Doctor Mid-Nite throws one of her blackout bombs at him and runs.

In the pilot episode, Brainwave, Gambler, Icicle, Shade, Grundy, Sportsmaster, Tigress, and Wizard fought the Justice Society of America (JSA) and killed most of its members, with Icicle fatally wounding their leader Starman. A decade after their victory, the ISA operate in Blue Valley under their civilian identities while the Fiddler&#x27;s wife Anaya Bowin fills in for him. After Courtney Whitmore finds Starman&#x27;s Cosmic Staff and forms a new JSA, the ISA take up arms to stop her as well as enact Project: New America to brainwash the Central United States&#x27; citizens. However, the new JSA, the Shining Knight, Barbara Whitmore, and Mike Dugan foil their plans, with most of the ISA either being killed, incarcerated, or escaped.
** In the second season, Cindy Burman and Eclipso form their own offshoot group called Injustice Unlimited, recruiting Sportsmaster and Tigress&#x27; daughter Artemis Crock and the Fiddler&#x27;s son Isaac Bowin to their cause. After failing to recruit Icicle&#x27;s son Cameron Mahkent, Injustice Unlimited fights Stargirl&#x27;s JSA. In the process, Stargirl accidentally frees Eclipso from his Black Diamond. He subsequently sends Burman to the Shadowlands and consumes Isaac while Artemis flees.

<doc id="713611" wikidata="Q5749290" url="?curid=713611" title="Hey Hey It's Saturday">
<text>Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday is a long-running variety television program on Australian television. It initially ran for 28 years on the Nine Network from 9 October 1971 to 20 November 1999, with a recess in 1978. Its host throughout its entire run was Daryl Somers, who later also became executive producer of the program. The original producer, Gavan Disney, left the program in December 1990 and Somers then formed a production company, Somers Carroll Productions, with comedy writer and on-screen partner Ernie Carroll, the performer of Somers&#x27; pink ostrich puppet sidekick Ossie Ostrich. Carroll retired in 1994, and Ossie was no longer featured in the show.

On 25 July 2009, the Nine Network announced the show would return for two reunion specials in late 2009 and hinted if they rated strongly, the show could return full-time. The first reunion show aired on 30 September 2009, and the second on 7 October, and both won the ratings on their respective nights. However, the reunion also received negative international attention for a segment featuring performers in blackface.

On 7 December 2009, it was announced that the show was planned to return in 2010 with 20 episodes. Broadcast of the 20 episodes were split into two groups with a break between them, with the revival premiering on Wednesday 14 April 2010. The second group was broadcast on Saturday nights from 16 October 2010 with the season finale on 27 November 2010. Due to falling ratings and high production costs, the show was not renewed for a new season in 2011.

A 50th anniversary special, &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s 50 Years&quot;, aired on the Seven Network on 10 October 2021, which is 50 years and one day after the show debuted.

The show&#x27;s website has since been turned into a paid streaming service where people can get access to full episodes and clips from the show for a monthly fee.

== Origins ==
Premiering on 9 October 1971, &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; was a Saturday morning children&#x27;s program in which Somers and Carroll provided &quot;top and tail&quot; segments between cartoon episodes. Due to the freedom afforded by its low-priority timeslot, the team was able to develop the comedic aspects of the show and the cartoon segments were eventually phased-out in favour of the live performances.

The constant ad-libbing (often laced with double entendre) of the presenters, including voice-over man John Blackman, soon attracted a cult following among younger and older viewers alike. The show&#x27;s style was variously influenced by vaudeville, the American &quot;Tonight Show&quot; format, the Marx Brothers, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Somers was also strongly influenced by comedy duo Graham Kennedy and Bert Newton, and it is significant that Carroll wrote for &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; (IMT) for many years.

Through the early 1970s, as its ratings grew and its meagre budget was increased, &quot;Hey Hey&quot; evolved into a freewheeling live light entertainment / comedy variety program. Regular segments included &quot;What Cheeses Me Off&quot; (which aired viewer complaints on virtually any subject), &quot;Media Watch Press&quot; (to which viewers contributed humorous newspaper misprints, almost invariably smutty), &quot;Red Faces&quot; (a &quot;New Faces&quot;–&quot;Gong Show&quot;-style talent competition) and &quot;Chook Lotto&quot;, a parody of variety show barrel competitions, in which the numbers in a farcical lotto game were chosen using numbered frozen chickens spun in a large wire cage. The team also performed live revue-style send-ups of current TV shows such as &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, or chaotic parodies of soap operas, police shows and other popular TV genres. Like Kennedy&#x27;s, the humour was of the wink-wink, nudge-nudge variety—viewers became accustomed to Blackman&#x27;s voice-over snigger—and the satire was broad and skit-level rather than sharp and disturbing. 

Like IMT, the earliest years of &quot;Hey Hey&quot; were marked by a similar &quot;anything can happen&quot; attitude, with sketches and improvisations stretched to the point of absurdity or terminated without warning. Sponsors were also laid open to some gentle ridicule, and live &quot;reads&quot; of sponsor advertising often became part of the comedy—a device that Graham Kennedy had first made famous on his radio show. &quot;Hey Hey&quot; also broke the &quot;fourth wall&quot;, frequently turning the cameras around, taking viewers behind the scenes into every area of the studio, out to the studio pool and even beyond the building. Many of the crew (e.g. floor manager Phillip Lambert) effectively became the &quot;de facto&quot; supporting cast, either as themselves or as occasional extras in regular segments. During this formative period there was no studio audience, although this later became an integral part of the show. Carroll also occasionally stepped out from behind Ozzie to perform in sketches or as a character, although he usually disguised his voice and/or appearance.

The rapid-fire comedic interplay between Somers, Carroll, Blackman and audio operator Murray Tregonning was central to the show&#x27;s success. Blackman kept up a near-constant stream of jokes and remarks, and he also provided the voice of the show&#x27;s many invented characters; some were merely voiced, while others were seen in various forms, including &quot;Mrs McGillicuddy&quot; (a stock photo of a toothless old woman); &quot;Angel&quot; (a Barbie doll dressed as an angel and chroma keyed into the scene); &quot;Norman Neumann&quot; (pronounced , like the manufacturer), a talking Neumann boom microphone; &quot;The Man From Jupiter&quot;; and the character that became an icon of the show, cheeky &quot;schoolboy&quot; Dickie Knee (a ball with a school baseball cap and long black-haired wig, stuck on a stick), who would pop up in front of Daryl (operated by a stagehand) and make rude remarks. Meanwhile, Tregonning was renowned for his remarkable ability to select and play appropriate sound effects at a second&#x27;s notice, and his humorous audio punctuations became another trademark of the series. This was long before the introduction of digital sound recording and digital samplers, and all Tregonning&#x27;s sound effects were played from a huge collection of tape cartridges.

The program went into recess in 1978 when Daryl and Ossie took the bold step of leaving the Nine Network for the rival 0–10 Network to present a primetime show featuring &#x27;comedy, audience participation and novelty games&#x27;, simply titled &quot;The Daryl and Ossie Show&quot;. Betty Bobbitt and Monique Daams were co-hosts. Only forty episodes were aired between September and November 1978. Daryl and Ossie then went back to Nine, and &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; returned to air in 1979. The show continued its evolution, beginning with recruitment of popular Queensland TV presenter Jacki MacDonald as a co-host on its return to Nine in 1979.

== Move to primetime ==
In 1984, the Nine Network moved the show from its morning timeslot to a primetime slot on Saturday nights, and it was briefly renamed &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; before reverting to its original name. During this time, &quot;Hey Hey&quot; also became one of the most important TV venues for both local and international music, film and TV stars. Many visiting overseas stars including actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Tom Jones, musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, and professional wrestler André the Giant were impressed by the program&#x27;s zany style (and its wide appeal) and made return appearances on subsequent visits. During its peak years, backed by the full resources of Nine and assisted by the rapid improvement in satellite communication, &quot;Hey Hey&quot; regularly travelled to locations all over Australia and even overseas for live broadcasts.

In October 1984, in a world first, reformed Aussie 1970s rock band Skyhooks appeared on the same night live from their concert at Melbourne&#x27;s Olympic Park, where they were performing in front of 26,000 people with Daryl and Ossie appearing with them on a giant screen above the stage. The band traded quips with the &quot;Hey Hey&quot; crew in between performing some of their biggest hits. Red Symons landed his &quot;Hey Hey&quot; gig as a result of the success of this appearance.

The show enjoyed strong ratings and maintained a dedicated following throughout the Eighties, and became a &quot;must watch&quot; program for a generation of viewers, with its popularity augmented by the stellar guest lineup and regular musical performances. Other personalities gradually came on board, including ex-Skyhooks guitarist Red Symons, who not only played in the show&#x27;s house band, but was also infamous for his withering sarcasm and as a judge on the &quot;talent&quot; segment &quot;Red Faces&quot;. Another noted Australian rock musician who became a long serving cast member was saxophonist Wilbur Wilde, who had previously played in Australian bands Ol&#x27; 55 and Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons. The regular cast was further expanded by the addition of former &quot;Countdown&quot; host Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum, comedian and ex-&quot;The Comedy Company&quot; star Russell Gilbert, actor and comedian Maurie Fields, and ex-&quot;The Curiosity Show&quot; presenter, Dr Deane Hutton.

&quot;Hey Hey&quot; retained its loyal following well into the 1990s—at one point between 1992 and 1994 also screening on TVNZ (briefly) in primetime, before later being moved to late Saturday nights—but Ernie Carroll decided to retire in 1994, taking Ossie Ostrich with him. Other characters, including &quot;Plucka Duck&quot;, were brought in prior to his retirement to partially fill the void left by Carroll&#x27;s departure. In the late 1980s, a cartoonist, Andrew Fyfe, was added to the team, offering visual gags similar to Blackman and Tregonning&#x27;s audio contributions. In 1992, Fyfe started his own children&#x27;s game show on Nine called &quot;GuessWhat?&quot;. On this show, he drew picture puzzles in front of two teams of children. A number of Somers–Carroll-produced &quot;Red Faces&quot; and &quot;Best of Hey Hey&quot; specials screened and were rescreened with high ratings for their timeslots. The show also had a lane named after it near its studios.

In 1998, Russell Gilbert got his own Somers–Carroll sketch comedy show on Nine, &quot;The Russell Gilbert Show&quot;, which lasted a year. Also in that year, &quot;Hey Hey&quot; went full circle and became a Saturday morning kids TV show again, in the form of a separate show called &quot;Plucka&#x27;s Place&quot;. This was hosted by Plucka Duck and Livinia Nixon. Livinia soon went on to co-host the main show. A wide range of Plucka merchandise was released to complement the new program.

== First cancellation ==
Nine Network executives decided toward the end of 1999 to cancel &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;. Nine cited various reasons for the axing, including a dip in ratings, an ageing audience and a need to cut costs at the network; however, the program still attracted an average of 1.2 million viewers. Somers had also claimed that he wanted to take the program into a new direction after the departure of Carroll, but the budget to redevelop the show was deemed excessive. The final episode ran for 240 minutes, an hour longer than was scheduled. After a break of a few years, Somers moved on to host &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on the Seven Network in 2004.

Nine re-aired the &quot;Hey Hey By Request&quot; specials in 2005 and June 2006. Also, on Nine&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Temptation&quot;, &quot;Hey Hey&#x27;s&quot; Wilbur Wilde and John Blackman appeared in May 2006 as part of &quot;Temptation&#x27;s&quot; Logies Superchallenge, and both represented the show. Dickie Knee also made a brief appearance.

In October 2006, the Seven Network began airing old Red Faces segments as a part of a show called &quot;The Best and Worst of Red Faces&quot;, which had originally screened on the Nine Network in the 1990s.

In June 2007, Daryl Somers received funding from the Seven Network to produce a pilot for a new Saturday Night format.

During the 2008 Logies ceremony, Daryl Somers presented an award for the &quot;Most Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot;. Prior to announcing the winner of the award, Somers did a skit with Dickie Knee and Plucka Duck.

== Reunions and revival ==
Since the show&#x27;s initial demise in 1999, there has been a considerable, on-going interest in the reformation of &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; in some capacity. In 2008, a Facebook group created by Corrine Lawrence of Broken Hill was set up to garner support for a return. In July 2009, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; ran a story on the campaign, which was subsequently picked up by other media outlets, including the Nine Network itself. Membership of the group skyrocketed as a result, going from 10,000 members to 32,000 members by 22 July 2009. By July 2010 membership exceeded 488,000. ABC Radio Broken Hill interviewed Lawrence and Somers on 22 July 2009 in regard to the growing interest.

It was reported on 24 July 2009 that Daryl Somers and the Nine Network had agreed to a deal for two specials to air in late 2009 after lengthy negotiations and, if the shows rated well, the two would negotiate the return of the show to its original format.

The specials were a mix of old and new content. Graeme Trippett joined Daryl Somers as co-executive producer. The first reunion special aired on Wednesday, 30 September 2009 and was a ratings success. It attracted a peak audience of 2.64 million viewers and an average audience of 2.169 million people, and beat the debut of &quot;Celebrity MasterChef Australia&quot; which had a peak audience of 1.92 million viewers and an average audience of 1.36 million. It gave Nine a 40% share of the ratings for that day, topping all other television stations by a massive 20%; it also ranked Number 1 as the highest rating show for that week. The second special aired on 7 October and attracted 300,000 viewers more. The second reunion special once again topped the ratings for that week with an average of 2.3 million viewers, giving Nine its highest share of 2009 at 43.3%. However, it also drew international reaction for the Red Faces segment &quot;The Jackson Jive&quot; (see below), consisting of a Michael Jackson impersonator and five backup dancers in blackface.

Following the success of the 2009 reunion specials, the show returned in 2010 after a deal was signed for at least 20 new episodes. The show was set to air on Wednesday nights but retain the title &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; with Daryl Somers returning as host. Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum had recently signed a deal with Channel 7, excluding him from the line-up. Red Symons was part of the lineup, after his decision to leave &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on Channel 7. The show returned on 14 April 2010 with over 1.5 million viewers across the five major cities.

== Second cancellation ==
Despite the initially respectable viewership numbers, ratings steadily dropped after the premiere episode of the new series; in the wake of this, on the 7 July 2010 episode, Somers announced on-air that the current run of episodes would conclude on 21 July 2010 and that &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; would be returning for a seven-episode run in October 2010 and be moved back to its original Saturday night timeslot. The second group of episodes started airing from 16 October 2010, with the season finale on 27 November 2010. However, although still somewhat popular in Melbourne, the ratings of the show nationally were not good enough for Nine to justify the expense of its production, leading to the second cancellation of the show.

In early 2012, Somers announced that Somers Carroll Productions had approached other commercial networks in hope for &quot;Hey Hey&#x27;s&quot; return but were unsuccessful despite their best efforts. It was also reported that Somers Carroll Productions were also looking into putting on a live stage version of the show in ticketed venues around the country instead.

Beginning in 2014, Somers Carroll Productions started releasing full episodes and highlights videos of the show from year to year on their official website, http://heyhey.tv. The site charges a fee of $6.95 a month to view full episodes from 1977 to 2010, and also features a four-part holiday special from 1974. Much of the early years of the show were not retained by GTV-9 and so are not available on the site or for DVD release. However, home recordings of some material have been included in retrospectives.

In December 2015, Somers announced that he was still in talks regarding &quot;Hey Hey&quot; returning &quot;whether it be one or two shows or whatever&quot; in a Christmas video message uploaded to YouTube. Prior to Somers&#x27; television return in 2016 as host of &quot;You&#x27;re Back in the Room&quot;, he also revealed that the Nine Network had approached Somers Carroll Productions for talks regarding a possible return of &quot;Hey Hey&quot;.

== 50th anniversary specials ==
In August 2021 it was reported that Somers had put out a call on social media for ideas for segments to be filmed for a 50th anniversary special that would air in future, with some segments already having been shot with the participation of key cast members. It was later confirmed that the Seven Network would air the special, titled &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s 50 Years&quot;, after Channel Nine revealed that it rejected Somers&#x27; pitch for the celebration. The 90-minute special aired on 10 October 2021, which is 50 years and one day after the show debuted. It drew in 1.2 million viewers.

The success of the anniversary special led to Seven commissioning a second special titled &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s 100 Years&quot;, which aired in Melbourne and Adelaide on 17 April 2022 and elsewhere in Australia on 24 April 2022. Seven also commissioned two Red Faces specials—&quot;The Best of The Best and Worst of Red Faces&quot; and &quot;The Very Best of the Best and Worst of Red Faces&quot;—which were broadcast in July 2022.

==Segments==
The show became a showcase for comedy and music which was reflected in the show&#x27;s segments:

===&quot;Red Faces&quot;===
&quot;Red Faces&quot; is a segment in which three (sometimes four) amateur performers or groups would present their routine (which was usually singing, dancing, comedy or something utterly bizarre) before a panel of judges. The segment and its name were a parody of the serious talent quest program &quot;New Faces&quot; coupled with a gong as in &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. The panel consisted of Hey Hey&#x27;s resident band&#x27;s guitar player Red Symons along with two of the show&#x27;s guests from that week.

Normally contestants would be gonged by Red Symons well before they finished their performance. Each contestant was then given a score out of 10 by each of the judges. For most acts, Red, always the last to give his score, would usually give his trademark score of 2 along with a pithy and acidic comment. Other times he would give high scores when the performance really was particularly good (or poor)—on several occasions he declared a performance the winning one, even if the others had not been done yet. The winning contestant received a $500 cash prize, second received $250 and third received $100. In the final years, the prizes were doubled and were sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s restaurant chain. In the 2010 revival of the show, first would receive $2000, second received $1000 and third received $500, initially sponsored by Hungry Jack&#x27;s but later changed to MyFun.

Some, but not many, contestants found fame after appearing on &quot;Red Faces&quot;. One group of friends known as The Music Men performed their own rendition of &quot;I Am the Music Man&quot;, and were later hired to perform in a beer commercial as a result. Jason Stephens, a comedian who appeared on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, had his start on Red Faces impersonating a penguin. The Melbourne-based musical comedy trio Tripod also performed a satirical medley of Oasis songs on the show in their very early years. Cate Blanchett also appeared on Red Faces in the late 80s, at the age of 17. &quot;Red Faces&quot; faced its oldest contestant, 96-year-old Dorothy Hayter, in the 80s and Red Faces had its youngest contestant, Kaitlin Elizabeth Millgate (4 months old) on 27 August 1994.

===&quot;Chook Lotto&quot;===
A longstanding game show segment, &quot;Chook Lotto&quot; (or Chooklotto) involved a large barrel of numbered frozen chickens, or &quot;chooks&quot;, and was a parody of Tattslotto, one of the National Lottery Draws of Australia. This segment ran from 1984, was rested in 1985, then returned in 1986 and went till the end of 1988. Daryl and Jackie McDonald would draw out 4 chickens numbered from 10 to 19. The home viewer would send in their entry and have to circle one of those numbers as a &quot;Super 69&quot; number. Then another cast member would enter the numbers into a computer (Originally an Atari 800XL, later an Olivetti Model) and whoever had those numbers would be the winner. Then Daryl would return to the desk and use the Super 69 number on ten paper eggs which had the same numbers as the chickens drawn out. Each of them held a prize. The main prize was a car from Ken Morgan Toyota; or, if the prize card had stars on it, they would win every prize inside the other eggs. This segment was eventually replaced by Plucka Duck (Pluck-a-duck); however, Chook Lotto returned in the 2010 revival of the show, with viewers invited to go to the show&#x27;s website and select four numbers as well as a supplementary number. Due to gambling laws in Australia, when &quot;Hey Hey&quot; was revived in 2009, the game was called &quot;Fake Chook Lotto&quot;, and contestants played for no prize whatsoever; however, once the legalities were sorted out, real prizes were offered in 2010.

The chickens were provided by Inghams Enterprises, and all 210 finalists would receive a voucher for a free chicken.

===&quot;Plucka Duck&quot;===
&quot;Plucka Duck&quot;, (at first Pluck-a-duck) was the replacement for Chook Lotto, and was responsible for creating the show&#x27;s character of the same name. Contestants would spin a numbered wheel with each number corresponding to a prize. After the spin, the contestant was allowed to either elect to keep their prize, or have another go by &quot;plucking a duck&quot;.

An important ingredient of the segment was Wilbur Wilde singing the Plucka Duck theme song to the tune of Roger Miller&#x27;s Chug-a-Lug:
&quot;Plucka Duck, Plucka Duck,&quot;
&quot;He&#x27;s not a chicken or a cow,&quot;
&quot;Plucka Duck, that&#x27;s him right now!&quot;
Many different versions of the theme song were used over time, based on a number of different tunes and adjusted lyrics, such as &quot;Excuse me while I kiss this duck&quot;, spoofing the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. (In the reunion shows and 2010 seasons 1 &amp; 2, Livinia Nixon joined in as well)

If the contestant elected to pluck a duck, the character Plucka Duck—a man in a duck costume—appeared and contestants plucked a feather from his tail. Each feather had a number concealed on it which corresponded to a prize, and that would be the prize won.

This was later changed. In the subsequent version of the contest a large mechanical contraption resemblant of a merry-go-round powered by a bicycle—usually ridden by Plucka himself—would be wheeled on. The contestant would have to pick a soft-toy duck (later created in Plucka&#x27;s image) from the spinning wheel, which would have a number hidden under its vest. This number, as with the wheel, corresponded with a prize.

On one occasion a contestant spun the wheel and landed the peg between the wheel&#x27;s highest prize (a car) and that of a lesser prize. The show was interrupted by a phone call from the head of the Nine Network, Kerry Packer, who directed Somers to &quot;Give her the car.&quot;

Plucka Duck would often have a female presenter performing alongside him. One of his presenters in the early 1990s was Melissa Hannan who was a popular TV personality at the time, daughter of Jimmy Hannan. Plucka Duck&#x27;s most recent female presenter was Suze Raymond, who was host of Channel Nine&#x27;s music video program Eclipse Music TV.

===&quot;Molly&#x27;s Melodrama&quot;===
The former talent co-ordinator/interviewer of Australian Television&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot;, Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum hosted a segment titled &quot;Molly&#x27;s Melodrama&quot;. This segment was similar to &quot;Countdown&quot;&#x27;s Humdrum segment where Molly would review local and international music as well as interview the famous and infamous faces of the musical scene. However, in true Hey Hey fashion, Molly&#x27;s segment was often taken over by other cast members (Dickie Knee in particular) who often performed cruel and painful pranks on Meldrum.

Prior to Molly Meldrum, the music review segment featured Gavin Wood, former Countdown voice-over man, with his segments frequently punctuated with practical jokes targeting him.

===&quot;Ad Nauseam&quot;===
A quiz where contestants, which usually were either studio audience members or &quot;Hey Hey&quot; guests, would answer questions based on television commercials.

===&quot;Beat It&quot;===
Similar to &quot;Ad Nauseam&quot;, this was a music quiz. The segment&#x27;s title was taken from the Michael Jackson song of the same name, which was played by the house band at the beginning of each installment.

===&quot;Lost for Words&quot;===
A game show style segment where a number of celebrities would be asked to name a word that started with the last letter of the previous word.

===&quot;Magic Word&quot;===
An audience member would be brought onto the stage and presented with an unusual word. Various &quot;Hey Hey&quot; crew members (usually Dickie, Red or Russell) would each give the member a possible meaning of the word, one of which was the word&#x27;s actual meaning. If that person correctly guessed whose meaning was the right one, that person would win a prize.

===&quot;Masterslime&quot;===
A parody of &quot;Mastermind&quot;, where contestants were strapped to a chair and had to answer a maximum of 6 questions. If that contestant got three questions wrong, he or she got &quot;slimed&quot;.

===&quot;Media Watch&quot;===
The &quot;Media Watch&quot; segment displayed humorous errors from TV and newspapers, generally sent in by the viewers. As the segment became more popular, it was split into &quot;Media Watch Press&quot; and &quot;Media Watch TV&quot;.

After the end of &quot;HHIS&quot;, the concept used in &quot;Media Watch&quot; and &quot;Phunny Fotos&quot; was replicated in the &quot;What The?&quot; segment on &quot;Rove Live&quot;. A similar segment appears on the U.S. TV program &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; under the name &quot;Small Town News&quot;.

===&quot;The Great Aussie Joke&quot;===
The hosts of this segment were Shane Bourne and Maurie Fields.
This segment was also featured on the first reunion show, which was fifteen years after Maurie&#x27;s death, with Maurie being superimposed into the set, and doing the joke with son Marty.

===&quot;The Nixon Tapes&quot;===
This segment, which appeared during Livinia Nixon&#x27;s time on the show, featured footage from movies or TV shows sent in by viewers, which contained a mistake or blooper of some sort (such as a production error). Audience members had to guess what the mistake was.

===&quot;Celebrity Head&quot;===
In this segment, three contestants would have the name of a celebrity placed on top of their heads where they could not see them. Using a series of questions which could only be answered with either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, the contestants had to try to guess who their celebrity was. The name, like many other parts of the show, was joked upon for its double entendre. As one of the most popular games on &quot;Hey Hey&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Head&quot; was adapted into a board game and retains casual interest.

=== Spoofs ===
Spoofs of other programs were a regular feature in the early years. This began with caustic voice-overs of old TV shows, (comparable to the much later American program &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; and similar to other Australian comedy efforts including the &quot;Europa Films&quot; segments of &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot; and the 1980s live comedy team Double Take). Later, this expanded into ongoing comedy sketches such as &quot;Division Saturday&quot; (a parody of &quot;Division 4&quot;), &quot;The Sillivans&quot; (&quot;The Sullivans&quot;) and &quot;The Shove Boat&quot; (&quot;The Love Boat&quot;).

The rural radio station 2QN &quot;Radio Deniliquin&quot; was satirised until official complaints were received, leading to a change over to &quot;2KW Upper Kumbukta West&quot;, a fictional country town that was also home to the &quot;Mrs Mac&quot; character. The fictitious country of &#x27;Biddleonia&#x27; was created as a new home for Irish jokes etc., so as not to offend any actual minorities.

Ian Buckland appeared and also performed in sketches including a satire called &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Magician&quot;. These segments spawned merchandise in the form of magic kits and products.

In each of the two reunion shows, there was a &quot;DisasterChef&quot; segment—a spoof of &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;Hey Hey&quot; spoofed many commercials with Trevor and Russell in them.

==Cultural impact==
Other Australian sketch comedy programs have satirised the show at one point or another, including &quot;The Comedy Company&quot; when it was parodied as &quot;Ho Hum It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; and &quot;Mad&quot; magazine which did a parody with the same title. The 1997 comedy film &quot;The Castle&quot; memorably portrayed the program as the Kerrigan family&#x27;s second-favourite television show (with their favourite show being &quot;The Best of Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;).

Use of terminology from the show spawned controversy during a Test cricket match between Australia and South Africa in Melbourne in December 2005. Australian bowler Shane Warne referred to South African batsman Makhaya Ntini, who was batting with an injured knee, as &quot;John Blackman&quot;. Warne was claiming that Ntini was controlling his &quot;dicky knee&quot; just like Blackman &quot;controlled&quot; Dickie Knee on the show. But Ntini, a Bantu, interpreted the remark as a racist jibe, and a minor controversy occurred. Eventually Australian captain Ricky Ponting explained the situation to South African captain Graeme Smith. Blackman himself had in fact visited the Australian team&#x27;s dressing rooms not long before the incident occurred.

A number of musical guests have written tribute songs to the show, including one by Ricky May.

==Criticism==
Despite the ongoing popularity of &quot;Hey Hey&quot; with viewers during its first incarnation, by the late 1990s some television critics considered the show to be corny and had become &quot;a tired old fossil&quot;. Although the 21st-century incarnation of the show also initially rated highly, the show came under renewed criticism for being backward and culturally insensitive. In retrospect, its outlook and many of its jokes are now considered by some commentators to be racist, sexist, and homophobic. The international controversy surrounding the Jackson Jive sketch on &quot;Red Faces&quot; led to the show being derided as &quot;old fashioned, out of touch, stale, [and] misguided&quot;. In 2021, Somers stated that he believed that some of the content that aired on the show in the past would not be acceptable today due to “political correctness and the cancel culture”; his remarks faced additional criticism.

Singer and frequent guest Kamahl has stated that his ethnicity and background were often the butt of jokes during his appearances on the show, likening his treatment to being humiliated. A rebuke by John Blackman to Kamahl&#x27;s claims received backlash on social media. In April 2021, Somers wrote a lengthy apology to Kamahl and to those who found the show&#x27;s content offensive. Kamahl unreservedly accepted Somers&#x27; apology.

===The Jackson Jive===
International controversy was caused by an act during the &quot;Red Faces&quot; segment during the second reunion special on 7 October 2009 called &quot;the Jackson Jive&quot;. The sketch featured six performers: five dressed as the Jackson Five in matching blackface outfits and wearing large afro wigs, with their teeth made extremely white; and one as an adult Michael Jackson, his face painted white, with Jackson&#x27;s portrayal being performed by a man of Indian heritage. They sang the Jackson Five&#x27;s hit &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; in a jive style. During the act, a cutaway showed a caricature of Kamahl with a caption reading &quot;Where&#x27;s Kamahl?&quot;. Red Symons eventually gonged the act off.

The group had performed the same act in &quot;Red Faces&quot; in 1989, without incident, during &quot;Hey Hey&#x27;s&quot; original run. This was not the only act to do blackface on the show — a woman using the alias of Mammy Smith (a reference to Mamie Smith) wore blackface to do a cover of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot; in an episode in 1993, while Somers himself had also appeared in brownface or blackface on multiple episodes, including a tribute to the late Ricky May in 1988 and in blackface to make fun of Kamahl.

American musician Harry Connick Jr., who performed on the show, was serving as a guest judge at the time and strongly expressed his disapproval of the skit when asked to give a score, and also later on in the show, and gave the performers a score of &quot;0&quot;. He appeared visibly uncomfortable throughout the skit. He said, &quot;If they turned up like that in the United States, it&#x27;d be like &quot;Hey Hey There&#x27;s No More Show&quot;.&quot; He later said that he would not have agreed to be on the show had he known beforehand about the sketch.

Somers apologised to Connick on-air after a brief station break. He said that nobody had intended to deliberately offend the viewers, the guests, or the audience, and he described the sketch as a &quot;bit retro&quot;. The incident drew some negative response within Australia, but it drew heavy negative reaction from commentators around the world, including in the US and the UK, and it prominently highlighted significant differences between the cultural acceptability of blackface in Australian culture compared with American culture.

==Programming history==
==Movie==
In 1992, &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; broadcast an episode from Australia&#x27;s latest theme park, Warner Brothers Movie World, situated in Gold Coast, Queensland. During their time there, the &quot;Hey Hey&quot; crew made a 45-minute feature film in just seven days. The film was titled &quot;Silence of the Hams&quot; and featured all the current cast members of the show. The movie&#x27;s premise was in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; and starred Daryl Somers as a private investigator named Rick Shaw, who is attempting to track down who is responsible for trying to destroy the world&#x27;s movie business.

The announcement was made on the following episode that they had made a movie and, after editing, that it would appear on the Nine Network. It was first broadcast on 15 June 1992 and was only ever repeated once on television. The movie has never been transferred to any form of official home media, but the entire movie was uploaded to YouTube on the official &quot;Hey Hey&quot; channel.

==Awards==
Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday won 19 Logies during its 29-year run.

<doc id="713612" wikidata="Q4719519" url="?curid=713612" title="Alexander Macomb (merchant)">
<text>Alexander Macomb (1748–1831) was an American fur trader, merchant and land speculator known for purchasing nearly four million acres from the state of New York after the American Revolutionary War. A Loyalist sympathizer, he operated from New York City after the war. His mansion in the city was used by President George Washington for several months in 1790 as the temporary president&#x27;s mansion.

Macomb had already made a fortune on land speculation in North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky, and believed he would make more profit in New York. Unable to sell the New York land fast enough to meet his debts, however, he was sent to debtors&#x27; prison for a period and never regained his fortune.

==Early life and education==
Macomb was born in 1748 in Ballynure, a rural village in County Antrim in Northern Ireland to John Macomb, a merchant, and Jane Gordon, both of Ulster Scot descent. Alexander also had a younger brother William and sister. In 1755, the whole family moved to Albany in the colonial Province of New York, which was a center of fur trading with the Iroquois and other Native American tribes.

Macomb and his brother William also became merchants and fur traders, operating around the Great Lakes as far west as Detroit, which had been under British control since 1763 and made into the British province of Quebec since 1774. Given their colonial settlement, French-Canadian traders were more numerous in the west, and competition was fierce. On August 27, 1774, Phyn &amp; Ellice, fur traders in Schenectady in the Mohawk Valley, sold its Detroit stock to the Macomb brothers and appointed them as its agents in that post. This was a notable success for 26-year-old Alexander and his younger brother.

==Career==

In Detroit during the American Revolution, Macomb and his brother William continued their fur trade with British and Native Americans. They conducted a huge volume of business with the British government post at Detroit, supplying the militia as well as the colonial Indian Department. The brothers took a partner because of the volume of their business, and in fall 1781, invested 100,000 dollars in New York currency in the business.

By 1785, Macomb returned to the East, settling in New York City; he followed his partner William Edgar, although they had dissolved the partnership. William Macomb stayed in Detroit, which was still under British rule. He later was elected to a term in the Upper Canada provincial assembly.

The city was rapidly rebuilding after the war, and men of Loyalist leanings, such as Macomb, were generally not discriminated against. They just wanted to get on with business. Macomb became a successful land speculator and shipping magnate in New York. He purchased large tracts of land in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina for resale. In 1788, he built a four-story brick city mansion on Broadway one block south of Trinity Church; the house had a frontage along one side. In part Macomb needed the space for his large household; by 1790, he was a widower with 10 children at home. His household included 25 servants, among them 12 enslaved African Americans. Macomb was the third-largest slaveholder in the city, as by that time slaveholding residents generally owned only a few slaves as domestic servants or skilled labor. New York did not pass legislation for gradual abolition of slavery until the early 19th century.

In 1790, the government of New York City leased Macomb&#x27;s New York City house to serve as the second presidential mansion of the temporary capital, after the first, the Samuel Osgood House on Cherry Street, proved too small. George Washington occupied the Macomb mansion from February to August 1790. The mansion was later adapted as a landmark hotel.

During this period, Macomb became active in civic affairs, using his expertise to purchase materials and direct the conversion of City Hall into Federal House for the temporary capital. He assisted the state legislature in supervising the construction of a building to house the state archives, and served two terms in the state assembly. Macomb also served as the first treasurer of &quot;New York&#x27;s first scientific body, the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Arts and Manufactures.&quot;

In July 1791, Alexander Macomb married again, to the young widow Mrs. John Peter Rucker, née Jane Marshall. They had another seven children together.

That year he purchased his largest tract of land of all, from the State of New York: 3,670,715 acres (14,855 km2), which has since known as &quot;Macomb&#x27;s Purchase.&quot; The tract included much of northern New York, along the St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario, including the Thousand Islands, and he paid about twelve cents an acre. The state took control of this land after the British ceded their own and Iroquois lands to the United States under terms of the treaty at the end of the war. Four of the six Iroquois tribes had been allied with the British but none was consulted during the treaty negotiations. The state&#x27;s treaty and sale of this land was never ratified by the United States Senate. In the late 20th century, some of the tribes filed land claims for compensation, claiming that New York state did not have the authority to treat with them, since the land cessions were never ratified by the U.S. Senate; some of the land claims were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.)

The purchase was divided into ten large townships. From this purchase are derived the deeds for all the lands that are now included in Lewis, Jefferson, St. Lawrence, and Franklin counties, and portions of Herkimer and Oswego counties.

Contrary to his expectations, Macomb&#x27;s enterprise was a failure. Sales of land did not keep pace with the due dates for payments. During the Panic of 1792, which further depressed land sales, Macomb was taken to debtors&#x27; prison with over $300,000 in debt. He never regained his fortune. As economic conditions improved, some land speculators later made huge amounts of money from their turnover of New York lands.

==Personal life==

On May 4, 1773, Macomb married Mary Catherine Navarre, daughter of Robert de Navarre, the &quot;subdélégé&quot; of Detroit under the French. They had a large family. His namesake son Major General Alexander Macomb (1782–1841) had an illustrious military career, winning the Battle of Plattsburgh and serving as Commanding General of the United States Army from May 29, 1828, to June 25, 1841. He and five other Macomb sons served in the military during the War of 1812.

Their daughter Jane Macomb married Hon. Robert Kennedy, a Scotsman who was brother of the Marquess of Ailsa. The Kennedys&#x27; daughter Sophia-Eliza married John Levett of Wychnor Park, Staffordshire, England.

Their son John Navarre Macomb (March 7, 1774 – November 9, 1810) married Christina Livingston, granddaughter of Philip Livingston, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and Founding Father of the United States. John Navarre Macomb&#x27;s children included Colonel John Navarre Macomb, Jr. (1811-1899). Macomb Jr&#x27;s children included Montgomery M. Macomb (1852-1924), a career United States Army officer who attained the rank of Brigadier General.

When his wife Mary died in 1790, Macomb had 10 children living at home. The next year he married Janet Marshall Rucker, herself a widow. They had seven more children, including Elizabeth Maria Macomb (born January 7, 1795), who married Thomas Hunt Flandrau, the law partner of Aaron Burr. The Flandraus&#x27; eldest son was Charles Eugene Flandrau (1808-1903), a Minnesota political and judicial figure. He was the grandfather of Isabella Greenway (1886-1953), U.S. Representative from Arizona.

Macomb died in Washington, D.C. in 1831.

<doc id="713613" wikidata="Q1633953" url="?curid=713613" title="The Things They Carried">
<text>The Things They Carried (1990) is a collection of linked short stories by American novelist Tim O&#x27;Brien, about a platoon of American soldiers fighting on the ground in the Vietnam War. His third book about the war, it is based upon his experiences as a soldier in the 23rd Infantry Division.

O&#x27;Brien generally refrains from political debate and discourse regarding the Vietnam War. He was dismayed that people in his home town seemed to have so little understanding of the war and its world. It was in part a response to what he considered ignorance that he wrote &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;. It was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1990.

Many of the characters are semi-autobiographical, sharing similarities with figures from his memoir &quot;If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home&quot;. In &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;, O&#x27;Brien plays with the genre of metafiction; he writes using verisimilitude. His use of real place names and inclusion of himself as the protagonist blurs fiction and non-fiction. As part of this effect, O&#x27;Brien dedicates &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; to the fictional men of the &quot;Alpha Company,&quot; giving it “the form of a war memoir,” states O’Brien.

==Plot summaries==
;&quot;The Things They Carried&quot;:
Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, the leader of a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam, carries physical reminders of Martha, the object of his unrequited love. Thoughts of Martha often distract Lieutenant Cross from his team&#x27;s objectives. A death in the squad under his supervision causes Cross to reconsider his priorities; as he was heartbroken, he burns and throws away all reminders of Martha in order to focus on the mission and avoid distractions.

;&quot;Love&quot;:
Cross and O&#x27;Brien reminisce about the war and about Martha. O&#x27;Brien asks if he can write a story about Cross, expressing his memories and hopes for the future; Cross agrees, thinking that perhaps Martha will read it and come find him.

;&quot;Spin&quot;:
A series of unrelated memories from the war is narrated from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s point of view. It includes moments of camaraderie and beauty: a joke of a hate letter to the Draft Board; learning a rain dance between battles.

;&quot;On the Rainy River&quot;:

O&#x27;Brien gets drafted as soon as he graduates from college. He is reluctant to go to war and considers fleeing the draft; he begins to travel north to the Canada–US border on the Rainy River. Near the border, he encounters an elderly stranger who allows him to work through his internal struggle. O&#x27;Brien is given the opportunity to escape; however, the societal pressures are too much for him. He goes to war ashamed with his inability to face the consequences of leaving.

;&quot;Enemies and Friends&quot;
Told in two sections, the developing relationship between soldiers Jensen and Strunk is shown. At first regularly antagonized by one another, the two are drawn toward respect and friendship by the stress and horrors of warfare. Ultimately, they agree that if one should be wounded, the other must deal a fatal blow as a form of mercy.

;&quot;How to Tell a True War Story&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien explores the telling of war stories by comrades, revealing that truth is delicate and malleable. Anything can be faked ... but generally, only the worst events can be proven real. He concludes that, in the end, the truth of a story doesn&#x27;t matter so much as what the story is trying to say.

;&quot;The Dentist&quot;:
In order to mourn Curt Lemon, a man O&#x27;Brien did not know well, he shares a brief recollection about a bizarre interaction between Lemon and an army dentist. Lemon, who is afraid of dentists, faints before the dentist can examine him. Later that night, however, he complains of a phantom tooth ache so severe a tooth is pulled - even though it&#x27;s perfectly healthy. Lemon has felt he needs to prove himself in front of his men and be the fearless man all soldiers are supposed to be.

;&quot;Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien recounts the legendary (and almost certainly exaggerated) tale of Rat Kiley&#x27;s first assignment, near the Song Tra Bong river. The area is so isolated that one of the soldiers flies his hometown girlfriend in by helicopter. At first, she cooks, cleans, and tends to the soldiers&#x27; wounds, but she gradually assimilates into Vietnamese guerrilla culture, even wearing a necklace made of human tongues, and disappears into the jungle.

;&quot;Stockings&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien explains how Henry Dobbins wore the stockings of his girlfriend around his neck to bed, and sometimes to battle. Even when the girlfriend breaks things off, he keeps the stockings around his neck, as their powers have been demonstrated.

;&quot;Church&quot;:
The platoon discovers an abandoned building being used as a sort of church, inhabited by monks who bring them food and supplies. The men discuss their relationships with churches, and for the most part, appreciate the interaction with other people and the peace of the building. Henry Dobbins wants to become a priest, but decides otherwise.

;&quot;The Man I Killed&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien describes a man he killed in My Khe, and how he did it. He makes up a life story for the man, torturing himself with the idea that the victim had been a gentle soul.

;&quot;Ambush&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s daughter asks if he killed anyone in the war; he lies to her that he did not. He then tells the story of an ambush outside My Khe, in which O&#x27;Brien kills a young man who may or may not have wanted to harm him.

;&quot;Style&quot;
The platoon witnesses a young Vietnamese girl dancing through the burned remains of her village, and argue over whether it&#x27;s a ritual or simply what she likes to do. Later, Azar mocks the girl, and Dobbins rebukes him.

;&quot;Speaking of Courage&quot;:
After his service, Norman Bowker is at a loss. His former girlfriend has married someone else, his closest friends are dead. He reflects on the medals he won in Vietnam, and imagines telling his father about both these and the medals he did not win. Ultimately, although he has no one to share these memories with, he finds catharsis in imagined conversations.

;&quot;Notes&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien says that Bowker asked him to write the previous story, and that he hanged himself three years later unable to regain his footing and find any meaning in life after the war. O&#x27;Brien muses over the suspicion that, without Harvard and writing, he too might have lost the will to live after returning from Vietnam.

;&quot;In the Field&quot;:
When Kiowa is killed on the banks of a river, during a mission led by Jimmy Cross, Cross takes responsibility for his death. He writes to Kiowa&#x27;s father while the others search for the body - as usual, Azar jokes around at first. Another soldier also feels responsible for the death, as he did not save Kiowa; the story ends with the body being found in the mud, and both soldiers left to their guilt.

;&quot;Good Form&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien reiterates that the real truth does not have to be the same as the story truth, and that it is the emotions evoked by the story that matter. He says that his story about killing a man on the trail outside My Khe was fabricated, but he wanted to provoke the same feelings in the reader that he felt during the war.

;&quot;Field Trip&quot;:
After finishing the story, &quot;In the Field,&quot; O&#x27;Brien says, he and his ten-year-old daughter visit the site of Kiowa&#x27;s death with an interpreter. The field looks different from his memory of it, but he leaves a pair of Kiowa&#x27;s moccasins in the spot where he believes Kiowa sank. In this way, he comes to terms with his friend&#x27;s death.

;&quot;The Ghost Soldiers&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien recounts the two times he was wounded. The first time, he is treated by Rat Kiley, and is impressed with the man&#x27;s courage and skill. The second time, he is treated by Kiley&#x27;s replacement, Bobby Jorgenson; Jorgenson is incompetent, and nearly kills O&#x27;Brien. Furious, O&#x27;Brien promises revenge, but can recruit only Azar. They scare Jorgenson by pretending to be enemy soldiers, but the soldier proves that he is not a coward, so O&#x27;Brien lets go of his resentment.

;&quot;Night Life&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien tells the second-hand account of Rat Kiley&#x27;s injury: warned of a possible attack, the platoon is on edge. Kiley reacts by distancing himself, the stress causing him first to be silent for days on end, and then to talk constantly. He has a breakdown from the pressure of being a medic, and shoots himself in the toe in order to get released from combat. No one questions his bravery.

;&quot;The Lives of the Dead&quot;:
O&#x27;Brien remembers his very first encounter with a dead body, that of his childhood sweetheart Linda. Suffering from a brain tumor, Linda died at the age of nine and O&#x27;Brien was deeply affected by her funeral. In Vietnam, O&#x27;Brien explains, the soldiers keep the dead alive by telling stories about them; in this way, he keeps Linda alive by telling her story. The thought and presence of death has shown to have a large effect on O&#x27;Brien.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
;Tim O&#x27;Brien: The narrator and the protagonist. While modeled after the author and sharing the same name, O&#x27;Brien (within the book) is a fictional character. The author intentionally blurs this distinction. 
;Lt. Jimmy Cross: The platoon leader, who is obsessed with a young woman back home, Martha (who does not return his feelings). He later believes that his obsession led to the death of Ted Lavender. 
;Bob &quot;Rat&quot; Kiley: A young medic whose exaggerations are complemented by his occasional cruelty. Eventually, he sees too much gore and begins to break down, imagining &quot;the bugs are out to get [him].&quot; 
;Norman Bowker: A soldier who O&#x27;Brien says attempted to save Kiowa the night he died. When Kiowa slips into the &quot;shitfield&quot;, Bowker repeatedly tries to save him but is unable to; as a result, he feels guilty for Kiowa&#x27;s death after the war. His memories continue to haunt Norman at home as he realizes that the world has moved on from the war, and wants nothing to do with the &quot;hell&quot; in Vietnam. He is continually haunted by the fact that he could not save Kiowa from sinking under the &quot;shitfield&quot; on a rainy night. However, O&#x27;Brien admits eventually that Norman did not fail to save Kiowa, that was fictional, and it is implied that O&#x27;Brien himself was the one who could not save him. After the war he briefly assists O&#x27;Brien in writing a story about Vietnam, but he hangs himself with a jump rope in an Iowa YMCA facility, leaving no note and his family shocked.
;Henry Dobbins: Machine gunner. A man who, despite having a rather large frame, is gentle and kind. He is very superstitious; as a result, he wears his girlfriend&#x27;s pantyhose around his neck as a protective &quot;charm&quot;, even after she dumps him. He briefly contemplates becoming a monk after the war due to their acts of charity.
;Kiowa: A compassionate and talkative soldier; he demonstrates the importance of talking about one&#x27;s problems and traumatic experiences. He is also a devout Baptist and a Native American who occasionally feels contempt and distrust towards white people. However, he appears to be Tim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s best friend in the company. Kiowa often helps other soldiers deal with their actions, such as taking the lives of other human beings. He is eventually killed when camping out in the &quot;shitfield.&quot;
;Mitchell Sanders: He is the radiotelephone operator for the platoon. Like O&#x27;Brien, he is also a storyteller and is portrayed as a mentor.
;Ted Lavender: A grenadier. He dies from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. He is notorious for using tranquilizers to cope with the pain of war, and for carrying a (rather large—six to eight ounces) stash of &quot;premium dope&quot; with him. Cross blames himself for Lavender&#x27;s death, as he was fantasizing about Martha when Lavender was shot.
;Curt Lemon: A young man who frequently attempts to assume the role as a tough soldier. However, he is also good friend of Rat Kiley. Lemon dies after setting off a rigged artillery shell. In one of the book&#x27;s more disturbing scenes, O&#x27;Brien and Dave Jensen help clear the trees of Curt&#x27;s scattered remains, during which Jensen sings &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; (something that &quot;wakes [Tim] up&quot;). After Lemon dies, Kiley writes a long, eloquent letter to Lemon&#x27;s sister, describing his friendship with Lemon and emphasizing how good a person Lemon was; Lemon&#x27;s sister never responds, which crushes Kiley emotionally.
;Azar: A young, rather unstable soldier who engages in needless and frequent acts of brutality. In one story, he blows up an orphan puppy that Ted Lavender had adopted by strapping it to a Claymore mine, then detonating it. He also aids Tim O&#x27;Brien in gaining revenge on Bobby Jorgenson, but mocks O&#x27;Brien when he&#x27;s not willing to take the revenge further. At one point, Azar breaks down emotionally, revealing that his cruelty is merely a defense mechanism.
;Dave Jensen and Lee Strunk: Minor soldiers who are the main characters of &quot;Enemies&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. Jensen fights with Strunk over a stolen jackknife, but they became uneasy friends afterwards. They each sign a pact to kill the other if he is ever faced with a &quot;wheelchair wound&quot;. After Strunk steps on a rigged mortar round and loses a leg, he begs Jensen not to kill him. Jensen obliges, but seems to have an enormous weight relieved when he learns &quot;Strunk died somewhere over in Chu Lai&quot;. Jensen is sometimes mentioned singing &quot;Lemon Tree&quot; after Curt Lemon&#x27;s abrupt death. Jensen also appears in &quot;The Lives of the Dead&quot;, where he pressures O&#x27;Brien to shake hands with a dead Vietnamese.
;Bobby Jorgenson: Rat Kiley&#x27;s replacement, after Rat &quot;put a round through his foot&quot; due to breaking under pressure. Green and terrified, he is slow to aid O&#x27;Brien when he is shot in the behind. Jorgenson nearly kills O&#x27;Brien after failing to treat him for shock. Filled with rage after his recovery, O&#x27;Brien elicits help from Azar to conspire and punish Jorgenson with a night of terrifying pranks. Later, O&#x27;Brien and Jorgenson become friends. Jorgenson may be a reference to a similarly-named character from &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;.

==Themes==
Genre

&quot;The Things They Carried&quot; is a war novel. Literary Critic David Wyatt points out that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel is similar to the works of Wilfred Owen, Stephen Crane, George Orwell, and Ernest Hemingway. O’Brien utilizes a style of writing that combines both fiction and nonfiction together into one piece. When asked to describe how he blurs this line between the two genres, O’Brien says &quot;I set out to write a book with the feel of utter and absolute reality, a work of fiction that would read like nonfiction and adhere to the conventions of a memoir: dedicating the book to the characters, using my name, drawing on my own life. This was a technical challenge. My goal was to compose a fiction with the texture, sound and authentic-seeming weight of nonfiction.&quot;

Truth vs Reality

Another theme that is highlighted in the short story &quot;Good Form&quot; is when the narrator makes a distinction between &quot;story truth&quot; and &quot;happening truth.&quot; O’Brien talks about truth and reality in relation to the story by describing, &quot;I can say that the book’s form is intimately connected to how I, as a human being, tend to view the world unfolding itself around me. It’s sometimes difficult to separate external &#x27;reality&#x27; from the internal processing of that reality.&quot; O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s fluid and elliptical negotiation of truth in this context finds echoes in works labeled as &#x27;non-fiction novels&#x27;.

Imagination/Comedy

Another important theme O&#x27;Brien highlights is the emphasis on imagination and pretending. He says that this theme, &quot;That’s an important part of my work. I’m a believer in the power of the imagination in ordinary human lives, and it’s much more important that we often credit.&quot; O&#x27;Brien goes on to say, &quot;And that is, I think, key to why I’m a fiction writer. If that element were not present, I’d be doing nonfiction. Or I wouldn’t be a writer at all.&quot; Tim O&#x27;Brien also alludes to the difficulty in using dark comedy as a theme by say, &quot;My guess is that I’ll be remembered, if I’m remembered at all, for my so-called tragedies: The Things They Carried, Going After Cacciato, If I Die in a Combat Zone and In the Lake of the Woods. Personally, I consider Tomcat in Love, if not my best book, certainly up there among the best. Yet I realize the most “literary” folks will disagree. In the end, it’s a matter of taste, I suppose. My sense of humor, which tends toward the outrageous, is plainly not for everyone.&quot; 

Morality

O’Brien also shows the constant struggle of morality throughout the story during the Vietnam War. A paper from Brigham Young University highlights the conflict that soldiers face when transitioning from civilian life to soldier life in relation to morality. It states, “As demonstrated through the soldiers’ experiences with pleasure, the soldiers’ moral code must change from that of their civilian lives in order for them to find moral justification in the everyday violence war requires.” The paper goes on to acknowledge that, “In O’Brien’s The Things They Carried, the concept of morality is complicated by the treatment of violence and a connection between violence and pleasure; resultantly, morality must be defined on a spectrum rather than a binary scale.”

Belief

Additionally, the character Tim references writing the book &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot; which the author Tim had written and published previously. The theme of believing in the people around you and having reliable people with you comes from the time period being filled with people who are opposed to the action of war. This causes the people who are drafted into the mutual hate to band together to live.

==Publication==
Before the book&#x27;s publication in 1990, five of the stories: &quot;The Things They Carried,&quot; &quot;How to Tell a True War Story,&quot; &quot;Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong,&quot; &quot;The Ghost Soldiers,&quot; and &quot;The Lives of the Dead&quot; were published in &quot;Esquire&quot;.

&quot;Speaking of Courage&quot; was originally published (in heavily modified form) as a chapter of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot;.

&quot;The Things They Carried&quot; was also included in the 1987 volume of &quot;The Best American Short Stories,&quot; edited by Ann Beattie and the second edition of &quot;Literature: Approaches to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama&quot; by Robert DiYanni.

==Reception==
&quot;The Things They Carried&quot; has received critical acclaim and has been established as one of the preeminent pieces of Vietnam War literature. It has sold over 2 million copies worldwide and celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2010. It has received multiple awards such as France&#x27;s Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize, as well as being a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award.

O&#x27;Brien has expressed surprise at how the book has become a staple in middle schools and high schools, stating that he &quot;certainly hadn&#x27;t imagined fourteen year-old kids and eighteen year-olds and those even in their early twenties reading the book and bringing such fervor to it, which comes from their own lives, really. The book is applied to a bad childhood or a broken home, and these are the things they&#x27;re carrying. And in a way, it&#x27;s extremely flattering, and other times, it can be depressing.&quot;

In 2014, the book was included in Amazon.com&#x27;s list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime and credited as the inspiration for a National Veterans Art Museum exhibit.

It was included in the Library of Congress 2016 exhibit &quot;America Reads&quot; of the public’s choice of 65 of &quot;the most influential books written and read in America and their impact on our lives&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The story &quot;Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong&quot; was made into a film in 1998 titled &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, starring Kiefer Sutherland.

A film adaptation of the book, directed by Rupert Sanders and starring Tom Hardy, is currently in pre-production. Scott B. Smith is adapting the script.

===Theatre===
The legal rights to adapt the book into a play were awarded to James R. Stowell. The book was adapted into a play and it premiered at The History Theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota, March 14, 2014. A second production was performed at The Lied Center, Lincoln Nebraska November 5, 2015. The stories &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;, &quot;On the Rainy River&quot;, &quot;How to Tell a True War Story&quot;, &quot;Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong&quot;, &quot;The Man I Killed&quot;, and &quot;Lives of the Dead&quot; were adapted for the theatre in March 2011 by the Eastern Washington University Theatre Department as part of the universities&#x27; &quot;Get Lit!&quot; Literary Festival in cooperation with the National Endowment for the Arts The Big Read 2011, of which &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; was the featured novel. The same department remounted the production in December 2011 for inclusion as a Participating Entry in the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. The production was selected as an alternate for KCACTF Region VII, as well as receiving other KCACTF honors for the production&#x27;s director, actors, and production staff.

===Games===
&quot;Carry. A game about war.&quot; is a 2006 tabletop role-playing game designed by Nathan D. Paoletta. Its author describes it as &quot;heavily inspired by the films &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and the novel &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;&quot;.

The organization publishes a bimonthly magazine distributed to members called &quot;The Canadian Amateur&quot;.

==History==

* 1967 — The Canadian Amateur Radio Federation (CARF) is formed.
* 1979 — The Canadian Radio Relay League (CRRL) is formed from the Canadian Division of the American Radio Relay League.
* 1993 — The Canadian Radio Relay League and Canadian Amateur Radio Federation merge to form Radio Amateurs of Canada, Inc.

==Regulatory advocacy==
Radio Amateurs of Canada represents all Canadian Amateurs at all levels of government:

1) At the local level it works with municipalities on such issues as regulations governing the placement of antennas. It also assists Amateur Radio clubs and other organizations in &quot;Public Service and Emergency Services (ARES)&quot; functions throughout the year. RAC also provides assistance to members wishing to install antennas and towers following Industry Canada&#x27;s (now called &quot;Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada&quot;) tower policy including CPC-2-0-03.

2) At the regional/provincial/territorial level it also works with governments on such issues as Distracted Driving Legislation and Emergency Services.

3) At the national level it represents all Amateurs on the &quot;Canadian Amateur Radio Advisory Board&quot; and works with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada on important issues such as tower legislation, RF interference and spectrum grabs by business.

4) At the international level RAC is a member of the &quot;International Amateur Radio Union&quot; (IARU) which works with the UN’s &quot;International Telecommunication Union&quot;&#x27; [2] to preserve and expand our frequency spectrum allocations. RAC pays its IARU dues based on the total number of Amateurs in Canada, and not just RAC members so it needs the support of members. RAC also sponsors a representative at the &quot;World Radiocommunication Conferences&quot; in Geneva, Switzerland to protect existing spectrum and open new spectrum such as the recent allocation at 60 metres at WRC-15. It is expensive to send a representative to Geneva and RAC coordinates the &quot;Defence of the Amateur Radio Fund&quot; so that Amateurs can contribute to this cost.

5) And beyond...: RAC also supports the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) and provides opportunities for students to experience the thrill of communicating with astronauts on the International Space Station.

The organization also acts as a consultatory body to municipal, provincial, and federal government bodies in matters concerning the Amateur Radio Service.

==Services==
The Radio Amateur of Canada club offers programs and publications to &quot;promote excellence, the state of the art, and the interests of Amateur Radio&#x27;s many varied activities&quot;.

<doc id="713625" wikidata="Q431927" url="?curid=713625" title="A Storm of Swords">
<text>A Storm of Swords is the third of seven planned novels in the fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; by American author George R. R. Martin. It was first published in the United Kingdom on August 8, 2000, with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called &quot;Path of the Dragon&quot;, which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book.

At its publication, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Serbia, and Israel, its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as &quot;Steel and Snow&quot; in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as &quot;Blood and Gold&quot; in August 2001 (with a specially commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes.

&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; won the 2001 Locus Award, the 2002 Geffen Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for the 2001 Nebula Award for Best Novel. It was the first novel in the series to be nominated for the Hugo Award, among the two most prestigious science fiction and fantasy publishing awards. However, it lost to J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; novel.

Meisha Merlin Publishing, which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, was planning to release a similar version for &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; caused it to lose its publishing rights, which Subterranean Press picked up. This edition, illustrated by Charles Vess, was released in the summer of 2006.

&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is also the name of the second expansion to the board game &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the third season of the HBO show &quot;Game of Thrones.&quot; The second half became the basis for the series&#x27; fourth season and some elements for the series&#x27; fifth season.

==Plot summary==
&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings, wherein Joffrey Baratheon and his uncle Stannis Baratheon compete for the Iron Throne, while Robb Stark of the North and Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands declare their independence (Stannis&#x27;s brother Renly Baratheon, the fifth &quot;king&quot;, has already been killed). Meanwhile, a large host of wildlings, the tribes from beyond the Seven Kingdoms&#x27; northern border, approach the Wall that marks the border, under the leadership of Mance Rayder, the self-proclaimed &quot;King Beyond the Wall&quot;, with only the undermanned Night&#x27;s Watch in opposition. Finally, Daenerys Targaryen, the daughter of a deposed former king of Westeros and &quot;mother&quot; of the world&#x27;s only living dragons, sails west, planning to retake her late father&#x27;s throne.

===In the Seven Kingdoms===

====The Riverlands====
At her father&#x27;s castle of Riverrun, Robb&#x27;s mother Catelyn Stark releases the captive Jaime Lannister, Joffrey&#x27;s &#x27;uncle&#x27; (but in actuality his biological father) in order to secure the release of Catelyn&#x27;s daughters, Sansa and Arya, who Catelyn believes are both being held hostage by the Lannisters in the capital city, King&#x27;s Landing. Jaime is sent south, escorted by Brienne of Tarth. Robb&#x27;s army returns to Riverrun, having vanquished the Lannister armies in the west, and Robb reveals that he has married Jeyne Westerling, violating his promise to be wed to a daughter of House Frey. These actions alienate and infuriate some of Robb&#x27;s allies, weakening his military position.

Jaime and Brienne are captured by mercenaries working for Roose Bolton, who is nominally an ally of Robb&#x27;s but is secretly plotting to undermine him to become Warden of the North. The mercenary captain Vargo Hoat has Jaime&#x27;s sword hand cut off. Brienne is thrown into a bear pit by Hoat, and Jaime risks his own life to rescue her. Bolton releases Jaime and Brienne and they travel to King&#x27;s Landing.

Arya Stark, traveling in the Riverlands, is taken in by the &quot;Brotherhood Without Banners&quot;: a band that defends the smallfolk of the Riverlands, led by Lord Beric Dondarrion and the red priest Thoros of Myr. The group captures Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane, Joffrey&#x27;s former bodyguard, and offers him trial by combat for his crimes. The Hound kills Beric, but Thoros resurrects him with the power of the fire god R&#x27;hllor. The Hound kidnaps Arya and flees with her, planning to ransom her.

In order to return north to defend the region against Greyjoy attacks, Robb needs the support of the Freys. The Freys propose a wedding between Catelyn&#x27;s brother Edmure Tully, now lord of the Riverlands, and one of Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s daughters, to compensate for Robb breaking his marriage agreement. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys turn on the Starks, massacring Robb&#x27;s bannermen. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, while Catelyn&#x27;s throat is cut and her body thrown into the river; Edmure is kept alive as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding.

Arya and the Hound witness the massacre and escape. Later, the Hound is wounded in a skirmish, and Arya abandons him. She takes a ship to the Free City of Braavos, where the assassin Jaqen H&#x27;ghar had told her she could find him.

In the epilogue, a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners, and she oversees the lynching of two of the Freys who were present at the Red Wedding.

====King&#x27;s Landing, Dragonstone, and the Eyrie====
The smuggler-turned-knight Davos Seaworth attempts to assassinate Stannis&#x27; advisor Melisandre, a sorceress and priestess of R&#x27;hllor, blaming her for Stannis&#x27; defeat in his prior assault on King&#x27;s Landing. Davos is imprisoned for treason, but at Melisandre&#x27;s behest, Stannis releases Davos and appoints him Hand of the King. Melisandre uses the blood of Edric Storm, a bastard son of Stannis&#x27; late brother King Robert, to curse the three rival Kings. Balon Greyjoy&#x27;s death is reported shortly thereafter.

King&#x27;s Landing welcomes the Lannisters&#x27; new allies, the Tyrells, as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell. Joffrey&#x27;s grandfather Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King, compels Sansa to marry his dwarf son Tyrion, to enable Lannister control of the North; but Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage against her will.

Margaery and Joffrey&#x27;s wedding is held as planned, but during the wedding feast, Joffrey is poisoned and dies. Tyrion is accused of the murder by his sister Cersei, Joffrey&#x27;s mother, and arrested. Sansa escapes the castle with the help of Lord Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish, who admits to her his culpability in Joffrey&#x27;s death, incriminating Margaery&#x27;s grandmother Olenna as well. Littlefinger and Sansa depart King&#x27;s Landing for the Eyrie, home of Catelyn&#x27;s sister Lysa Arryn.

After Balon, Robb and Joffrey die, as Melisandre predicted, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety to prevent Melisandre and Stannis sacrificing him for the power in his blood. Davos discovers a request by the Night&#x27;s Watch for aid against Mance Rayder; Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but changes his mind after Davos shows Stannis the Night&#x27;s Watch&#x27;s plea.

The spymaster Varys and Tyrion&#x27;s lover Shae testify falsely against Tyrion at his trial. Prince Oberyn Martell, of the southern region of Dorne, offers to represent Tyrion in a trial by combat against Cersei&#x27;s champion, Gregor Clegane, who was responsible for the death of Oberyn&#x27;s sister Elia. Oberyn nearly wins, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn&#x27;s spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is sentenced to death.

Upon returning to King&#x27;s Landing, Jaime gives Brienne a sword reforged from the hereditary sword of the Stark family, and sends her to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, and helps Varys free Tyrion from prison. Jaime reveals that Tyrion&#x27;s first wife Tysha, whom Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison, was not a prostitute as Tywin told him, and genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin; during his escape, he murders both Shae and Tywin before fleeing Westeros.

At the Eyrie, Sansa is disguised as an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger, and Littlefinger and Lysa are married. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison her late husband Jon, and to pin the blame on the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. Lysa threatens to kill Sansa, thinking she is trying to seduce Littlefinger, but Littlefinger intervenes and, after revealing that he had only ever loved Catelyn, pushes Lysa to her death.

===The North===
The detachment of the Night&#x27;s Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont are attacked by undead wights and the Others, hostile inhuman creatures from the far north. The Watch suffer heavy casualties, although the steward Samwell Tarly kills one of the Others with a blade of obsidian. Soon some of the Watch mutiny and kill Mormont, but Sam escapes with the help of a wildling girl, Gilly. Sam, Gilly, and Gilly&#x27;s newborn child approach the Wall, assisted by a strange figure riding an elk, whom Sam calls Coldhands. Among the dead are most of the Watch&#x27;s senior leadership.

Robb&#x27;s brother Bran and his friends, having escaped the Boltons&#x27; attack on the Stark castle Winterfell, are guided north by Bran&#x27;s dreams of a three-eyed crow. At the Wall, Sam guides them to Coldhands and returns to the Night Watch&#x27;s headquarters at Castle Black, having sworn to keep Bran&#x27;s survival secret even from Jon Snow, Bran&#x27;s bastard brother and Sam&#x27;s fellow Watchman.

Jon, on a mission to infiltrate the wildlings, convinces Mance that he is a deserter from the Night&#x27;s Watch, and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor Ygritte also begin a sexual relationship. After crossing the Wall, Jon escapes the wildlings and returns to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army attacks Castle Black; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, the Watch&#x27;s surviving leaders Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne falsely accuse Jon of treachery, and send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, Stannis&#x27; army arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but Jon decides to decline Stannis&#x27; offer, and is elected by the Night&#x27;s Watch as its new Lord Commander.

===Slaver&#x27;s Bay===
Daenerys Targaryen learns that large slave armies can be bought in Astapor, one of the cities of Slaver&#x27;s Bay, and buys the entire host of the warrior-eunuch Unsullied by offering one of her infant dragons in exchange. Upon payment, Daenerys orders the Unsullied and the dragon to turn on the slave traders and sack the city. With the help of her maturing dragons, she frees all the slaves of Astapor, including the Unsullied. Daenerys&#x27; army then conquers the slaver city of Yunkai; but the lords of the neighbouring city of Meereen antagonize Daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. Consequently, Daenerys besieges the city to no avail.

Daenerys discovers two traitors in her camp: Ser Jorah Mormont, who had spied on her for the late King Robert, and Ser Barristan Selmy, the humiliated former Lord Commander of King Robert&#x27;s Kingsguard. Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city&#x27;s rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys&#x27; forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard, while Jorah, who refuses to admit any wrongdoing, is banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left to govern Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to remain in Meereen to rule it herself.

==Characters==
The tale is told through the eyes of ten main characters, plus a one-off prologue POV and a one-off epilogue POV character, for a total of 12 narrators.
* Prologue: Chett, a brother and hound-keeper of the Night&#x27;s Watch
* Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Imprisoned by the Starks.
* Jon Snow, bastard son of Eddard Stark, a sworn brother of the Night&#x27;s Watch
* Catelyn Stark, of House Tully, widow of Lord Eddard Stark, mother of Robb Stark
* Tyrion Lannister, youngest son of Tywin Lannister, a dwarf, brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister
* Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark
* Arya Stark, youngest daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark
* Bran Stark, son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark, heir to Winterfell and the North
* Samwell Tarly, cowardly son of Lord Randyll Tarly, a sworn brother of the Night&#x27;s Watch

* Epilogue: Merrett Frey, a member of the numerous Frey family.

==Development==
On October 6, 2009, Martin noted on his blog that his manuscript for &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; had been 1521 pages in length; the initial printed hardcover came in at 992 pages. Martin did not write the Red Wedding chapters until he had completed every other chapter of the book, as he felt it was &quot;the hardest thing I ever wrote&quot; and that he would rather delay writing until absolutely necessary. In contrast, he referred to the chapter of Joffrey&#x27;s fatal wedding as &quot;easy and fun to write&quot; but that he nevertheless tried to instill empathy for the painful demise of this very unpopular character and &quot;bring home the point that this, too, was a human being who was scared and terrified and then dead&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said the third volume was &quot;one of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin&#x27;s ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, the smell of the sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn&#x27;t go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention.&quot;

Martin was nominated for the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel, but lost to J. K. Rowling for &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. Afterwards he made this comment about his fans: &quot;Eat your heart out, Rowling. Maybe you have billions of dollars and my Hugo, but you don&#x27;t have readers like &quot;these&quot;.&quot;

There are 57 public hospitals, including seven national referral hospitals, 47 county referral hospitals, and two sub-county hospitals. There are 103 private hospitals, 58 mission hospitals, and 12 NGO hospitals in Kenya. Hospitals are classified into three levels: Level 6 hospitals are national referral hospitals and large private teaching/mission (faith-based) hospitals; Level 5 hospitals are county referral hospitals and large private/mission (faith-based) hospitals; and Level 4 hospitals are sub-county hospitals and medium-sized private/mission (faith-based) hospitals The oldest hospital in Kenya is the Mombasa Hospital, which was opened for Europeans in 1891. In 1898, the British opened the Native Civil Hospital in Makadara for non-European Patients. In 1944, the government decided to dedicate the Mombasa hospital to the African community and let European and Asian patients go elsewhere.

<doc id="713636" wikidata="Q17118943" url="?curid=713636" title="Pruno">
<text>Pruno, also known as prison hooch or prison wine, is a term used in the United States to describe an improvised alcoholic beverage. It is variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, fruit juices, hard candy, sugar, high fructose syrup, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread is incorrectly thought to contain yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in US prisons, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates. It can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been described as a &quot;vile-flavored wine cooler&quot;. Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced against the risk of discovery by officers), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno&#x27;s alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine).

==Description==

Typically, the fermenting mass of fruit—called the &quot;motor&quot; or &quot;kicker&quot; in US prison parlance—is retained from batch to batch to make the fermentation start faster. The more sugar is added, the greater the potential for a higher alcohol content—to a point. Beyond this point, the waste products of fermentation (mainly alcohol) cause the motor to die or go dormant as the yeasts&#x27; environment becomes too poisoned for them to continue fermenting. This also causes the taste of the end product to suffer. Ascorbic acid powder is sometimes used to stop the fermentation at a certain point, which, combined with the tartness of the added acid, somewhat enhances the taste by reducing the cloyingly sweet flavor associated with pruno.

In 2004 and 2005 botulism outbreaks were reported among inmates in two California prisons; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspects that potatoes used in making pruno were to blame in both cases. In 2012, similar botulism outbreaks caused by potato-based pruno were reported among inmates at prisons in Arizona and Utah.

Inmates are not permitted to have alcoholic beverages, and correctional officers confiscate pruno whenever and wherever they find it. In an effort to eradicate pruno, some wardens have gone as far as banning all fresh fruit, fruit juices, and fruit-based food products from prison cafeterias. But even this is not always enough; there are pruno varieties made almost entirely from sauerkraut and orange juice. Food hoarding in the inmate cells in both prisons and jails allows the inmates to acquire ingredients and produce pruno. During jail and prison inmate cell searches, correctional officers remove excessive or unauthorized food items to halt the production of pruno. Pruno is hidden under bunks, inside toilets, inside walls, trash cans, in the shower area and anywhere inmates feel is safe to brew their pruno away from the prying eyes of correctional officers and jailers.

Jarvis Jay Masters, a death row inmate at San Quentin, offers an oft-referenced recipe for pruno in his poem &quot;Recipe for Prison Pruno&quot;, which won a PEN award in 1992.

Another recipe for pruno can be found in Michael Finkel&#x27;s &quot;Esquire&quot; article on Oregon death row inmate Christian Longo.

In 2004 at the American Homebrewers Association&#x27;s National Homebrew Conference in Las Vegas, a pruno competition and judging was held.

<doc id="713642" wikidata="Q3800983" url="?curid=713642" title="Invisible Kid">
<text>Invisible Kid is the name of two superheroes in the DC Comics universe, both of whom are members of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th and 31st centuries.

==Publication history==
The first Invisible Kid debuted alongside Chameleon Boy and Colossal Boy in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #267 by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. He was introduced as a new member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

==Fictional character biography==
===Lyle Norg===
The first Invisible Kid was Lyle Norg, an early member of the Legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented. He is a colleague of Brainiac 5 and a member of the Legion Espionage Squad before being killed by Validus.

A temporal clone of Invisible Kid from &quot;Batch SW6&quot; is introduced during the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot; following the Magic Wars.

====Reboot====

Following &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, which reboots the Legion&#x27;s continuity, Lyle Norg is resurrected and depicted as the leader of the Legion Espionage Squad and an intellectual rival of Brainiac 5.

According to &quot;The Definitive Guide to The Characters of the DC Universe&quot; (2004), he is in a homosexual relationship with Condo Arlik / Chemical King. This, however, was never stated explicitly in the comic itself and never developed.

====&quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity (2004-2009)====

In the &quot;Threeboot&quot;, Lyle Norg is the son of a Science Police officer who plans to seize his research for their use. After discovering this, Lyle uses his serum on himself and joins the Legion.

====Post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;====
Invisible Kid appears as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, which restores an analogue of the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Legion.

===Jacques Foccart===

Jacques Foccart, the second Invisible Kid, is a native of the Ivory Coast who becomes a superhero while battling his sister Danielle, who is possessed by Computo.

====&quot;Five Years Later&quot;====
After the Dominators take over Earth, Jacques joins a resistance cell alongside Tyroc and the former members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes. After the Dominators are defeated, Invisible Kid and Tyroc respectively become president and vice president of Earth. Later, following the destruction of Earth, Jacques resigns to rejoin the Legion and Troy becomes president.

====Post-Zero Hour====
In post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; continuity, Jacques Foccart is a friend and classmate of Lyle Norg who is forced to drink his serum by Charma, a fellow student with mind control abilities.

===The New Golden Age===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Invisible Kid is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members who arrive in the present and confront the Justice Society over their decision to recruit Legionnaire, a young, heroic incarnation of Mordru.

==Reception==
Syfy ranked the first Invisible Kid as the 24th greatest Legion of Super-Heroes member, stating that during &quot;his time in the 1960s, Invisible Kid was a constant, but not noteworthy presence, until he was killed by Validus. When the Legion rebooted in 1994, he became a major player, showing he was one of the savviest members of the team&quot;. Syfy ranked the second Invisible Kid as number 38 describing the character as &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;notable because of his name and his Rogue inspired haircut&quot;. Syfy opined that despite &quot;later becoming President of Earth, he never did a whole lot except shout French expressions&quot;.

<text>The Mobile River is located in southern Alabama in the United States. Formed out of the confluence of the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers, the approximately river drains an area of of Alabama, with a watershed extending into Mississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee. Its drainage basin is the fourth-largest of primary stream drainage basins entirely in the United States. The river has historically provided the principal navigational access for Alabama. Since construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, it also provides an alternative route into the Ohio River watershed.

The Tombigbee and Alabama River join to form the Mobile River approximately northeast of Mobile, along the county line between Mobile and Baldwin counties. The combined stream flows south, in a winding course. Approximately downstream from the confluence, the channel of the river divides, with the Mobile flowing along the western channel. The Tensaw River, a bayou of the Mobile River, flows alongside to the east, separated from as they flow southward. The Mobile River flows through the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta and reaches Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico just east of downtown Mobile.

== Biodiversity ==
The Mobile River Basin historically supported the greatest biodiversity of freshwater snail species in the world (Bogan et al. 1995), including six genera and over 100 species that were endemic to the Mobile River Basin. During the past few decades, publications in the scientific literature have primarily dealt with the apparent decimation of this fauna following the construction of dams within the Mobile River Basin and the inundation of extensive shoal (a shallow place in a body of water) habitats by impounded waters (Goodrich 1944, Athearn 1970, Heard 1970, Stein 1976, Palmer 1986, Garner 1990).

The James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant, owned by Alabama Power, has a leaking unlined Fly ash pit located &quot;on land that lies within a hairpin crook of the Mobile River.&quot; For this reason the river has been described as the third most endangered river in the United States.

==Crossings==
This is a list of bridges and other crossings of the Mobile River from Mobile Bay upstream to its source at the confluence of the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers. Proposals for a new bridge to carry Interstate 10 over the river have been debated for several years. Currently the Alabama Department of Transportation is conducting an environmental impact study for such a crossing and into the widening of the Jubilee Parkway, which carries Interstate 10 over Mobile Bay. The location of this bridge is of great debate with some parties pushing for a crossing south of the current tunnels while others are opposed to anything south of the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge.

<text>The International Basketball Association (IBA) was founded in 1995 by a group of businessmen led by Tom Anderson. The original owners of franchises in the league were George Daniel (Black Hills Posse-Rapid City, SD), John Korsmo, Al Gardner, and Al Hovland (Fargo Beez), Jeff McCarron (St. Cloud Rock &#x27;n Rollers), Bill Sorensen (Dakota Wizards - Bismarck) and Earl Barish (Winnipeg Cyclones). Earl Barish of Winnipeg directed the IBA as League President and the league eventually grew to ten franchises. On September 1, 2001, CBA and IBL teams merged with the IBA and purchased the assets of the defunct CBA, including its name, logo and records from the bankruptcy court and restarted operations, calling itself the CBA. This group continued to operate until June 2009, when it was forced to cease operations.

<text>George Ellis Pugh (November 28, 1822July 19, 1876) was a Democratic politician from Ohio. He served in the U.S. Senate from 1855 to 1861.

==Early life==
Pugh was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was the son of Lot and Rachel (née Anthony) Pugh, who were married in Hamilton County, Ohio, on July 7, 1814. George had three brothers and a sister.

George Ellis Pugh descended from Ellis Pugh, Sr. (1656–1718), an early Welsh immigrant to Pennsylvania and Quaker minister who, with his wife Sinah, emigrated to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution in 1686.

Pugh attended Miami University.

== Career ==
He began practicing law in 1843, later serving as a captain in the 4th Ohio Regiment in the Mexican–American War. He was commended for gallantry and bravery in action at the Battle of Atlexco. After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1848 to 1850, he served as State Attorney General from 1852 to 1854. Pugh served a single term in the United States Senate from 1855 to 1861, losing a re-election bid to Salmon P. Chase, whom he had replaced.

In the Senate, he became a champion of the Western Democracy, that is, Midwestern Democrats, first against the Republicans, and later against Stephen A. Douglas&#x27; opponents inside the Democratic Party. He spoke in favor of the Lecompton Constitution on March 16, 1858, but followed the instructions of the Ohio legislature in voting against that constitution.

On February 23, 1859, during the lame-duck session, Albert Gallatin Brown attacked Douglas over popular sovereignty. Douglas defended his position, and was joined by Charles E. Stuart of Michigan, David C. Broderick of California, and Pugh. Pugh said, &quot;In the whole Dred Scott case, there was no act of a Territorial legislature before them [the justices] in any shape or form.&quot; Pugh explained, &quot;This is the first time I ever heard, in a case where nine judges pronounce their opinions &quot;seriatim&quot;, that because one of them {Roger B. Taney} in illustration collaterally makes a reference, that becomes the decision of the court.&quot; Pugh answered the demand for a federal slave code, to be imposed on all territories, in this way: &quot;Never; while I live, never! I consider it a monstrous demand.&quot;

Pugh later had an exchange with Jefferson Davis about the difference, if any, between Douglas&#x27; Freeport Doctrine on popular sovereignty and the doctrine Davis had set forth in a speech at Portland, Maine.

Despite his loss to Republican Salmon P. Chase in his attempt to secure a second term to the Senate in 1860, Pugh would continue to vocally politically during his remaining time in office. Most notably, during the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency, Pugh would be one of the most vocal voices in Congress in arguing against the use of coercion to force the seceding Southern states back into the Union. In leaving Congress, he would leave the mantle of being the leading voice for this position to fellow Ohioans Clement L. Vallandigham and George H. Pendleton in the House of Representatives.

He is best known as a member of the counsel for the defense of Clement L. Vallandigham in 1863. During the Civil War, he fell into disfavor with the citizens of Ohio because he was a Democrat and for defending Vallandigham and later in 1863, he lost the election for the office of Lieutenant Governor. He also lost in the election for Congress in 1864 and refrained from seeking public office for several years while continuing his legal profession.

He emerged to the political front again in 1873 when he was elected to become a delegate to the Ohio State Constitutional Convention but withdrew from the deliberations and declined to serve. He died in Cincinnati in 1876 when he was 53 years old.

Pugh ran for the lieutenant governorship in 1863 and the United States House of Representatives in 1864, losing both times.

== Personal life ==
Pugh married Theresa Chalfant in 1840 and had three children, Robert Chalfont, Nina Theresa and Thomas. He became a Roman Catholic in 1855.

<doc id="713664" wikidata="Q49095233" url="?curid=713664" title="21-gun salute">
<text>A 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized of the customary gun salutes that are performed by the firing of cannon or artillery as a military honor. As naval customs evolved, 21 guns came to be fired for heads of state, or in exceptional circumstances for heads of government, with the number decreasing with the rank of the recipient of the honor. While the 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized, the number of rounds fired in any given salute will vary depending on the conditions. Circumstances affecting these variations include the particular occasion and, in the case of military and state funerals, the branch of service, and rank (or office) of the person to whom honors are being rendered.
==History==

The custom stems from naval tradition in the sixteenth century, when a warship would show its peaceful intent by firing its cannons harmlessly out to sea until its ammunition was depleted. Since cannons then required a considerable time to reload, the ship was effectively disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. In the earliest days, seven guns was the recognized British national salute. In those days, gunpowder made from sodium nitrate was easier to keep on dry land than at sea. The early regulations stated that although a ship would fire only seven guns, the forts ashore would fire three shots to each one shot afloat, hence the number 21.

Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death.

==By country==
===Canada===

The prime minister, heads of foreign missions, foreign heads of government, and the Vice President of the United States are entitled to a 19-gun salute.

A 17-gun salute is given to the Canadian Minister of National Defence when visiting a saluting station (limited to once a year), as well as foreign ministers of defence.

Before they were abolished in 1968 by the Trudeau government, royal salutes were fired in Ottawa, the provincial capitals, and Montreal and Vancouver also on the Queen&#x27;s Accession Day (6 February), the Queen&#x27;s actual birthday (21 April), the Queen&#x27;s Coronation Day (2 June), the Birthday of the Duke of Edinburgh (10 June), and the Birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (4 August).

===China===
21-gun salutes are fired when welcoming heads of state to China, e.g. presidents, monarchs, governors-general. 19-gun salutes are fired when welcoming heads of government to China, e.g. prime ministers, chancellors, etc.

12-gun salutes are fired in three-volley form every year during commemorations of the repatriation of Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteers soldiers from South Korea.

The number of gun salutes fired at military parades depends on how many years of a specific event it is commemorating. For example, a 100-gun salute was fired at the CPC Centenary service in 2021.

===Denmark===

The day after the birth of Princess Benedikte in 1944 which took place during Nazi Germany&#x27;s Occupation of Denmark, members of the Danish resistance group Holger Danske performed a salute of 21 bombs in the Ørstedsparken public park in central Copenhagen as a reference to the traditional 21-gun salute performed at the occasion of royal births.

===Egypt===
A 21-gun salute was used during the Parade of the Pharaohs (also called the Golden Parade) on April 3, 2021, when the mummies of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were transferred to their new museum in Giza. Most of the mummies belonged to the New Kingdom period, which ruled Egypt between 1539 BC to 1075 BC. A 21-gun salute was used during the funeral of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in February 2020. A 21 gun salute was used after President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was sworn in on 8 June 2014. A final 21-gun salute was also fired to honor King Farouk prior to his embarking on the yacht &quot;Mahrousa&quot; that brought him to exile in Italy in 1952.
===France===

The 21-gun salute is accorded to the French president, forming part of his &quot;military honors&quot; (&quot;honneurs militaires&quot;). The salute is given during the inauguration ceremony (by two 75mm guns) and during naval visits. These honors are extended to foreign heads of state during state visits.

===India===
During the British Raj, India developed a formal hierarchical system of gun salutes. At the time of Indian independence in 1947, the hierarchy of salutes within British India stood as follows:

Prior to Indian independence in 1947, the Viceroy of India received a unique viceregal salute of 31 guns. After 1947, the 31-gun salute was retained for honouring the Governor-General of India (1947–1950).

In addition, 118 out of the roughly 565 princely states were classified as &quot;salute states&quot;. The rulers of salute states were granted gun salutes ranging from 9 guns to 21 guns. This system continued till 1971 when privileges and Privy Purses of ex-rulers were abolished by the Government of India.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, the 21-gun salute is done during state visits of foreign heads of state visiting Indonesia.

The modified 17-gun salute is executed during the commemoration of the precise seconds of the proclamation of the independence of Indonesia on the 17 of August at 10:00 near the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta. It is also done in other cities in Indonesia during the independence day commemoration ceremonies. See the 17-gun salute in Indonesia here: Indonesian Independence Day 17-gun salute

===Israel===
In Israel the practice of gun salute has been eliminated due to the country having &quot;suffered many terror attacks&quot;.

===Singapore===
A 21-gun salute is carried out for National Day Parades in Singapore by the Singapore Artillery during the presidential inspection of parade contingents.

In a rare occurrence, the 21-gun salute was given to the former Prime Minister and founding leader Lee Kuan Yew during his state funeral.

===Sri Lanka===
Traditionally, the Sri Lanka Navy accords a 25-gun salute to the nation on the National Day, which is held on 4 February each year. The salute is fired from the ceremonial naval gun battery at Colombo Lighthouse - a tradition inherited from prior British influence. It began with HMCyS Vijaya of the Royal Ceylon Navy, the first warship of the navy according a 25-gun salute on 4 February 1951 with its single 4-inch gun.

===Sweden===
The number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The so called royal salute is 21 rounds.

Authorized saluting stations are:
*Skeppsholmen, (Stockholm)
*Kastellholmen, (Stockholm)
*Kungshall, (Karlskrona) 
*Kungsholms fort, (Karlskrona)
*Fårösund, (Gotland)
*Bodens fästning, (Boden)
*Kusthöjden, (Härnösand) 
*Vaxholms fästning, (Vaxholm)
*Oskar-Fredriksborg, (Vaxholm)
*Skansen Lejonet, (Göteborg)
*Älvsborgs fästning, (Göteborg)

===United Kingdom===

The number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The basic salute is 21 rounds. In Hyde Park and Green Park an extra 20 rounds are added because they are Royal Parks. At the Tower of London 62 rounds are fired on royal anniversaries (the basic 21, plus a further 20 because the Tower is a Royal Palace and Fortress, plus another 21 &#x27;for the City of London&#x27;) and 41 on other occasions. The Tower of London probably holds the record for the most rounds fired in a single salute – 124 were fired when the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s birthday (62 rounds) coincided with the Saturday designated as the Queen&#x27;s official birthday (also 62 rounds).
On 10 April 2021, a 41-gun salute was fired to mark the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with the timing changed from 1 round every 10 seconds to 1 round every minute, resulting in a total duration of 41 minutes for the salute.
When Queen Elizabeth II died, a 96-gun salute was fired to represent the years of her life.

Authorized military saluting stations are: 

in England:
*Hyde Park, London
*The Tower of London 
*Royal Arsenal, Woolwich 
*York Museum Gardens
*The Army station in Colchester
*Royal Artillery Barracks, Larkhill 
*Royal Citadel, Plymouth
*Dover Castle
*His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base, Portsmouth

in Scotland: 
*Edinburgh Castle 
*Stirling Castle 
in Wales: 
*Cardiff 
in Northern Ireland:
*Hillsborough Castle 
Salutes are also fired in Gibraltar.

===United States===
The practice of firing one gun for each state in the union was not officially authorized until 1810, when the United States Department of War declared the number of rounds fired in the &quot;National Salute&quot; to be equivalent to the number of states, which at the time was 17. The tradition continued until 1841 when it was reduced from 26 to 21.

In 1842, the United States declared the 21-gun salute as its &quot;Presidential Salute&quot;. While the &quot;National Salute&quot; had been formally established as the 21-gun salute, the current tradition holds the salute on Independence Day to be a 50 rounds—one round for each state in the union. This &#x27;Salute to the Nation&#x27; is fired at noon on 4 July, on U.S. military installations. The U.S. Navy recognizes Presidents&#x27; Day and Memorial Day with a 21-gun salute at 1200.

In April 1914, during the Mexican Revolution, the Tampico Affair occurred, and escalated as a result of a twenty-one gun salute (or more specifically, the lack of one). Nine unarmed U.S. sailors were arrested in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, for entering an off-limit area at a fuel loading station. Despite them being released, the U.S. Naval commander demanded an apology and a twenty-one gun salute. The apology was provided, but not the salute, giving President Woodrow Wilson reason to order the U.S. occupation of the port of Veracruz.
The gun salutes fired in the United States are as follows:

====Deaths of presidents====

A U.S. presidential death also involves 21-gun salutes and other military traditions. On the day after the death of the president, a former president or president-elect—unless this day falls on a Sunday or holiday, in which case the honor will be rendered the following day—the commanders of Army installations with the necessary personnel and material traditionally order that one gun be fired every half-hour, beginning at reveille and ending at retreat.

On the day of burial, a 21-minute gun salute traditionally is fired starting at noon at all military installations with the necessary personnel and material. Guns will be fired at one-minute intervals. Also on the day of burial, those installations will fire a 50-gun salute—one round for each state—at five-second intervals immediately following lowering of the flag.

<text>The Legion of Substitute Heroes are a group of fictional characters in the future of the DC Comics universe. The &quot;Subs&quot;, as they are often called, are rejected Legion of Super-Heroes applicants who band together to prove that their powers are not as useless as they claim. They first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #306 (March 1963), and were created by Edmond Hamilton and John Forte.

The group were depicted as reasonably effective superheroes until Keith Giffen, during his tenure as &quot;Legion&quot; writer, began depicting the team as something of a joke. The Subs regain some respect when founding member Polar Boy joins the main Legion, and a new Legion of Substitute Heroes is formed.

==Fictional team biography==
The Legion of Substitute Heroes is founded by Polar Boy, Night Girl, Stone Boy, Fire Lad, and Chlorophyll Kid, five young heroes whose powers are not sufficient to earn them membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes — Stone Boy, for example, can transform into stone, but is completely immobile when using his power. After receiving a Legion flight belt as a consolation prize, the five disconsolate teenagers decide to form a group that can pinch hit for the Legion. After several failures as a team, the Subs save the Earth from an invasion by Plant Men while the Legion is off planet fighting a decoy armada of robot spaceships.

At first operating in secrecy, the Legion of Substitute Heroes is gradually recognized as a valuable asset, most notably after the assault on the Citadel of Throon when the regular Legionnaires are all defeated and Polar Boy and Night Girl are left to end the siege. Later recruits to the Legion of Substitute Heroes include Antennae Lad, Color Kid, Double-Header, Infectious Lass, Porcupine Pete, Dream Girl, and Star Boy. The team fell into disuse during the Bronze Age of Comic Books since their simple, young-readers-oriented concept left them out-of-place in the dark, socially relevant stories of the era.

The Legion of Substitute Heroes were first presented as a starring feature in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #59 (July 1983). Writer/artist Keith Giffen had been asked to do a story featuring the villain Ambush Bug, and decided that the Legion of Substitute Heroes would be appropriate heroes to pit against the villain since they were &quot;goofy&quot; and obscure enough that he could do what he wanted with them without fear of arousing controversy. Exceptionally good sales on the humor-driven issue led to DC publishing a &quot;Legion of Substitute Heroes Special&quot; on April Fool&#x27;s Day, 1985. Again written and drawn by Giffen, the &quot;Legion of Substitute Heroes Special&quot; became regarded as a seminal work, and Giffen was emboldened to employ the issue&#x27;s boundary-pushing, often metafictional comedy in his later works.

After a colorful, if unimpressive, career, Polar Boy disbanded the Legion of Substitute Heroes, and went on to attain full Legion membership. Many of the remaining members eventually join the Legion as well during the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;. Shortly before the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot;, a new Legion of Substitute Heroes is formed, consisting of former Legion of Super-Heroes members Cosmic Boy, Bouncing Boy, and Duo Damsel, as well as Night Girl, a new Karate Kid (Myg), and Comet Queen. 

During the events of &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 4), the &quot;Subs&quot; come into their own as an insurgent group that aids a resistance to the Dominators. Here, old Subs Fire Lad, Stone Boy, Chlorophyll Kid, Color Kid, and Porcupine Pete, are joined by new allies such as Ron-Karr and Grinn.

Following the &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; reboot, the Subs appear in &quot;Legionnaires&quot; #43 during Legion tryouts. Infectious Lass, Fire Lad, and Color Kid are on the cover, while Stone Boy, Chlorophyll Kid, Night Girl, and Polar Boy all try out.

In the &quot;Legion Worlds&quot; one-shot focusing on Braal, Cosmic Boy along with Invisible Kid, Leviathan, and Chuck Taine call themselves the &quot;Legion of Subs&quot;; the word &#x27;Subs&#x27; is short for &quot;subterfuge&quot;.

In the Legion series launched in 2004, Polar Boy and Chlorophyll Kid (renamed Plant Lad) appear as a part of the Wanderers led by Mekt Ranzz. This version of Polar Boy can only slow molecular movement. Night Girl applies for membership in the Legion but is rejected and made a reserve member (as part of the &quot;Legion Reserve&quot;), along with Sizzle, an energy manipulator, and Turtle, a strong and durable alien.

Versions of Infectious Lass, Polar Boy, Night Girl, Stone Boy, Fire Lad, and Chlorophyll Kid similar in appearance to their pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; counterparts appear in the &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; limited series and the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;.

In part five of the &quot;Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, Fire Lad, Stone Boy, Chlorophyll Kid, and Rainbow Girl are called in to help battle the Justice League of Earth, a tyrannical, xenophobic association. After the villainous group is defeated, the Subs claim their satellite base as their own.

At an early point in their timeline, the Substitutes team up with the Inferior Five in a failed attempt to steal the Legion&#x27;s thunder and destroy a primeval black hole.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Legion of Substitute Heroes members Rainbow Girl, Animal Lad, and Stone Boy arrive in the present to recruit Doctor Fate after his disastrous attempt to get Salem the Witch Girl into Limbo Town.

==Roster==
* Animal Lad (Ennis Janhson): A metahuman who can transform animals into humans and vice versa. In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, he was transformed into a humanoid lion under unspecified conditions.
* Antenna Lad (Khfeurb Chee Bez): A Grxyorian with large ears that enable him to pick up transmissions across space and time.
* Chlorophyll Kid (Ral Benem): A native of the planet Mardru who gained the ability to accelerate plant growth after being exposed to a hydroponic serum. He is also an expert at botany and hand-to-hand combat.
* Color Kid (Ulu Vakk): A native of the planet Lupra who gained the ability to alter color after being exposed to an interdimensional rainbow beam.
* Double-Header (Frenk/Dyvud Retzun): A Janusian who is skilled at hand-to-hand combat. However, his two heads often clash with one another, preventing them from operating effectively.
* Dream Girl (Nura Nal): A native of the planet Naltor who possesses dream-based precognition.
* Fire Lad (Staq Mavlen): A Shwarian who can breathe fire and later developed other types of pyrokinesis over time.
* Infectious Lass (Drura Sehpt): A Somhaturian who houses various bacteria and viruses in her body. They are harmful to others, but not herself.
* Night Girl (Lydda Jath): A native of the planet Kathoon who possesses superhuman strength, but only in darkness.
* Polar Boy (Brek Bannin): A native of the planet Tharr who can generate intense cold. 
* Porcupine Pete (Peter Dursin): A metahuman who has porcupine-like quills across his body and can expel them as projectiles. However, he cannot emit quills individually and must do so all at once.
* Rainbow Girl (Dori Aandraison): A native of the planet Xolnar who can harness all aspects of the emotional spectrum.
* Star Boy (Thom Kallor): A native of the planet Xanthu who can manipulate density and gravity.
* Stone Boy (Dag Wentim): A Zwenian who can transform into a stone-like form. Despite being immobile and inflexible, he does possess super-strength and enhanced durability.

==In other media==
* The Legion of Substitute Heroes appear in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, consisting of Porcupine Pete (voiced by James Arnold Taylor), the unofficial leader and a responsible &quot;mother&#x27;s boy&quot; who lacks control over his powers, but is determined to be a hero; Chlorophyll Kid (voiced by Alexander Polinsky), a protective and clever yet nebbish individual who is fond of creating cacti with humanoid silhouettes to confuse his enemies; Stone Boy (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal), an intelligent yet stoic member who lacks a sense of humor and occasionally forgets to revert to normal; Color Kid (also voiced by James Arnold Taylor), an energetic and enthusiastic member who appears oblivious to danger and unaware of his powers&#x27; limited uses; and Infectious Lass (voiced by Kari Wahlgren), a withdrawn member who can manifest slime capable of inducing mild colds, though she is not immune to her powers. This version of the team was inspired to become heroes by Bouncing Boy, who encouraged them to keep following their dreams. Additionally, Antennae Lad, Polar Boy, Fire Lad, Double-Header, and Night Girl make non-speaking cameo appearances as Legion applicants.
* Color Kid, Fire Lad, and Night Girl appear in the one-shot comic &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Meets the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;.
