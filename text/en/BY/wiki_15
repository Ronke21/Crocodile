<text>The Santa Ana River is the largest river entirely within Southern California in the United States. It rises in the San Bernardino Mountains and flows for most of its length through San Bernardino and Riverside counties, before cutting through the northern Santa Ana Mountains via Santa Ana Canyon and flowing southwest through urban Orange County to drain into the Pacific Ocean. The Santa Ana River is long, and its drainage basin is in size.

The Santa Ana drainage basin has a diversity of terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains in the north and east, to the hot, dry interior and semidesert basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. A wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.

Humans have lived on the Santa Ana River for at least 9,000 years. The villages of Lupukngna, Genga, Pajbenga, Totpavit, and Hutuknga were located along the river. The river was first seen by Europeans in 1769, when it received its name from members of the Spanish Portola expedition. Because it was one of the only reliable sources of water in a wide region, many large ranchos developed along the river and one of its major tributaries, Santiago Creek. After the area became part of the United States, the economy transitioned to agriculture, before urbanizing in the 20th century. Many cities established during this time including Santa Ana, Riverside and Anaheim derived their names from the river. In order to protect urban areas from the river&#x27;s flood threat, major channelization and damming projects were undertaken, resulting in the loss of much of the natural river channel.

==Course==

The Santa Ana River rises in the southern San Bernardino Mountains, at the confluence of two tiny streams, Heart Bar Creek and Coon Creek, at an elevation of . Its highest sources are Dollar Lake, at , and Dry Lake, at , both on the northern flank of San Gorgonio Mountain, at the headwaters of the South Fork Santa Ana River. The river flows west through a wide, deep and heavily forested mountain valley. About from its headwaters, it receives its first major tributary, Bear Creek, which enters from the north. Bear Creek receives its water from Big Bear Lake, a popular recreational mountain lake. The river turns south, passing through the Seven Oaks Dam, and reaches the arid Inland Empire lowland covering large parts of San Bernardino County and Riverside County. It receives Mill Creek from the south and passes to the south of San Bernardino, then receives City Creek from the north and San Timoteo Creek from the south. Due to water diversions for groundwater recharge, the river bed is usually dry in this stretch between Mill Creek and the outlet of the Veolia water treatment plant north of Riverside, which restores a year-round flow. From there to Prado Dam the river supports a riparian zone with considerable greenery.

Not far below the confluence with San Timoteo Creek, Lytle Creek enters from the north. Lytle Creek is one of the largest tributaries of the Santa Ana river, rising from three forks in the San Gabriel Mountains and flowing southeast, before emptying into the Santa Ana River as Lytle Creek Wash. From there, the river turns southwest, and after passing through western Riverside, it discharges into the normally dry flood control reservoir formed by Prado Dam. Two major tributaries of the river join in the reservoir area: Chino Creek from the north, and Temescal Creek from the south. Temescal Creek drains the largest area of all the tributaries, because it provides the outflow from Lake Elsinore, into which the San Jacinto River flows. It is also one of the longest, at in length. Except during the wettest years when Lake Elsinore fills high enough to overflow, Temescal Creek contributes little to no water into the Santa Ana River.

Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, and cuts between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows southwest towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire flow of the river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing about half of the county&#x27;s municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington State Beach in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.

==Watershed==

The Santa Ana River drains the largest watershed of California&#x27;s South Coast region, covering in parts of San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and Los Angeles Counties. Although the river does not pass through Los Angeles County, some of its tributaries, including San Antonio Creek extend into it. The watershed consists mainly of high mountain ranges that surround and divide large, dry alluvial valleys. The San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains encircle the arid Inland Empire lowland on the north and east. The Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills divide the Inland Empire from the Orange County coastal plain; the Santa Ana Canyon is the only natural break in the range between the two lowlands. The southern part of the watershed, drained by the San Jacinto River into Lake Elsinore and via Temescal Creek into the Santa Ana River, constitutes some 45% of the total area and extend its boundaries as far south as the Colorado Desert at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. The river has over 50 named tributaries, most of which are intermittent streams.

As of 2000, about 4.8 million people lived in the Santa Ana River watershed. Most of the population is concentrated close to the river in urban centers such as San Bernardino, Riverside, Anaheim and Santa Ana. The Inland Empire still has large areas dedicated to agriculture and ranching, although it is rapidly urbanizing. In Orange County, nearly all the valley lands are urbanized. Some major bodies of water in the watershed include Irvine Lake, Lake Mathews, Lake Perris, Diamond Valley Lake, Lake Skinner, and Big Bear Lake. All of these are water supply reservoirs constructed by county or state water agencies, and with the exception of Big Bear, much of the water is imported from other parts of California due to the arid local climate. Diamond Valley Lake, with a storage capacity of , is the largest and most recently constructed. Lake Elsinore is the only major natural lake in the watershed.
The Santa Ana River watershed shares boundaries with many adjacent river basins. In the northwest is the San Gabriel River, which empties into the Pacific at Long Beach. In Orange County, the San Diego Creek, Aliso Creek, and San Juan Creek watersheds border the Santa Ana watershed on the south. Further south, in San Diego County, the watershed is bordered by those of San Mateo Creek, the Santa Margarita River, and the San Luis Rey River. On the east the watershed shares borders with those of the Whitewater River and the Coachella Valley, flowing into the Salton Sea, and on the north with the Mojave River, which flows into the endorheic basin of the Mojave Desert.

In Orange County, the river flows across a vast, gently sloping alluvial fan created from its own sediments therefor its drainage basin is extremely narrow because the surrounding land slopes away from the river bed. In its natural state the river would frequently change course into one of many intermittent channels that fan out across the plain. Today, these auxiliary river-beds have been artificially disconnected from the Santa Ana River and converted into flood control channels, including the Talbert and Huntington Beach channels, which empty into the Pacific very near the mouth of the Santa Ana River. The combined Talbert-Huntington Beach watershed drains of mostly suburbanized land. The river originally had many different outlets to the Pacific, one of which even extended as far north as the San Gabriel River. The original mouth of the river was located at Newport Bay, which drained into the Pacific Ocean, at what is today the entrance to Newport Harbor. Based on a U.S. Coastal Survey from 1878, Newport Bay was predominantly a river estuary with few open channels. The river flowed into the bay bringing with it heavy silt and making boating difficult. To eventually create Newport Harbor, sand deposited by the Santa Ana River had to be constantly dredged away. In 1920, the Bitter Point Dam was built to divert the river away from the bay and on its current course to the ocean at Huntington Beach. Stone jetties were built to form the new river mouth. All of the Islands in Newport Harbor are the product of dredging and man made forming from the sands and silt deposited over time by the Santa Ana River.

==Geology==

Ancient igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock underlie and form the geologic base of the Santa Ana River watershed. Most of the strata in the flat valleys and basins of the watershed are underlain by thousands of feet of sediment deposited by shallow seas that covered parts of Southern California in ancient times. Most of the mountains in and around the basin consist of granite batholiths about 75 million years old. However, above elevations of ancient metamorphic rock up to 1.7 billion years old is exposed. This rock originally formed at the bottom of the ancestral Pacific Ocean and was uplifted to the highest peaks of the mountains by tectonic action. Even during the ice ages, Southern California mountains were not subjected to extensive glaciation, so the rock has remained for tens of millions of years without significant erosion.

Diverse and complex faulting and geologic instability have shaped the Santa Ana River watershed. The San Andreas Fault runs across the northern section of the watershed and is responsible for the formation of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains, part of the Transverse Ranges of Southern California. The Elsinore–Whittier Fault Zone crosses the Santa Ana River further downstream, near the Orange/Riverside County line. Tectonic action along this fault created the Santa Ana Mountains, Puente Hills, East Orange Hills, Chino Hills, Loma Ridge, and the other mountain ranges and ridges that run northwest–southeast across the lower section of the watershed – the coastal Peninsular Ranges. While the Transverse Ranges rise above in many places, the highest peaks of the Peninsular Ranges reach less than half that elevation.

The cutting of Santa Ana Canyon across the Peninsular Ranges is attributed to the wetter Southern California climate during the Wisconsinian Glaciation and earlier ice ages, during which rivers in Southern California were substantially bigger in volume. The Santa Ana River, which existed prior to the creation of the Peninsular Ranges, maintained its course as an antecedent stream due to its increased erosive power. The canyon was eroded through bedrock that today divides the groundwater basins of the Inland Empire and the coastal plain. Because groundwater in the watershed generally flows from east to west, it is forced to the surface at the bedrock &quot;sill&quot; of Santa Ana Canyon, resulting in a perennial stream that prior to development flowed freely across the coastal plain to the Pacific. During this period, the Santa Ana changed course multiple times, eroding now-dry wind gaps in the Peninsular Range and the coastal mesas around Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.

==Ecology==

Hundreds of species of animals and plants characterize the Santa Ana River&#x27;s diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, 50 mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.

The largest portion of the watershed, the Inland Empire portion, is dominated by a hot, dry desert climate that supports sparse wildlife, while the climate and vegetation of the San Jacinto River and Temescal Creek watershed is similar to that of the southern Central Valley. Downstream of the desert was once the coastal sage scrub and dry grassland community of the Orange County coastal plain, but that region has been almost entirely lost to urbanization. Rimming the arid portions of the watershed are the chaparral zones, consisting of sclerophyllous, thick, low bushes and small trees. The chaparral generally is found between elevations of , and occurs mainly closer to the coast on the windward side of the Peninsular Ranges. The scrub oak is one of the most common plants in chaparral regions, forming a dense groundcover that makes it difficult for humans and large animals such as mountain lions, coyotes, and bobcats to traverse. Chaparral growth is determined by wildfires and droughts, and depends on the semi-arid climate of the region.

Perennial and seasonal streams often are lined with live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones of the main stem Santa Ana River. The largest unbroken riparian corridor is the stretch between Riverside and Prado Dam, where the river has been largely left in its natural state despite pollution from urban runoff. In addition, the flood control basin behind Prado Dam contains of seasonal wetlands. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, was once found along most of the Santa Ana River, but is now rarely seen. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles on either side of the river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.

The alpine and subalpine zones, despite their high elevation (above ) and significant rainfall (at least per year, except in drought years), are sparsely vegetated. The windswept terrain of the alpine zone is primarily small brush and weeds, while trees—mostly small gnarled pines and junipers—occur in canyons and shielded depressions in the subalpine zone. Inland elevations above support much denser forest. Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, black oak, lodgepole pine, and willow constitute most of the forested lands. The mountain habitats of the watershed support many animals typical of Californian mountain regions, including squirrels, chipmunks, black bears, mule deer, and many species of migratory birds. In the canyons of the San Bernardinos, the river is abundant in rainbow trout and is lined with alders, willow and cottonwoods. Where the river and its large upper tributaries empty out of the mountain canyons into the Inland Empire basin, they are surrounded by the alluvial scrub zone, a mix of desert and upper riparian vegetation. Along the main stem, this zone begins at the base of Seven Oaks Dam and ends at the Lytle Creek confluence.
Historically, the Santa Ana was named &quot;the best stream in Southern California [for steelhead trout habitat]&quot;. The steelhead is an anadromous fish, similar to salmon, that migrates up rivers and streams to spawn. Unlike salmon, which usually only reproduce once, steelhead may reproduce multiple times and have a much longer life span. Steelhead was once found along the entire main stem of the Santa Ana River, as well as on some of its main tributaries—Santiago Creek, San Antonio and Chino Creeks, Cucamonga Creek, Lytle Creek, City Creek, and Mill Creek. Few, if any, steelhead were present in Temescal Creek (although one of its tributaries was stocked in the 1930s) and none inhabited the San Jacinto River, because it is disconnected from most of the Santa Ana River system. Up to the 1950s, significant numbers of steelhead trout still migrated in from the ocean. Because of pollution and modifications to the river, very few steelhead still use the river. There is a population of wild stream resident coastal rainbow trout upstream of Seven Oaks Dam and in the upper reaches of a few tributaries. Despite the rarity of steelhead, in recent years fin samples from 13 trout were collected from Harding Canyon in the Santiago Creek tributary of the Santa Ana River and genetic analysis has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks.

Invasive species—those that are not native to the region—have caused problems in the watershed for many years. One of the most troublesome invasive species is the giant reed, which plagues many coastal Southern California waterways. The giant reed is similar to a tall grass or thin bamboo, but grows quickly and can take over native stands of vegetation, block the streambed, hurts the habitat of native animals, and increases the hazard of wildfires. Perhaps the largest effect that giant reed has is its usage of water. To support its fast growth rate, the giant reed population in the Santa Ana River watershed can consume of water per year.

Other invasive species also have affected the Santa Ana River. One of the most prominent is the brown-headed cowbird, which feeds off parasites and insects identified with cattle, which were brought to Southern California during the Spanish Rancho period. The brown-headed cowbird is a &quot;brood parasite&quot;, or a bird that lays its eggs in another bird&#x27;s nest. One of the most afflicted birds is the least Bell&#x27;s vireo, whose population also suffers from the loss of riparian habitat. The least Bell&#x27;s vireo is considered an endangered species, as is the southwestern willow flycatcher, whose habitat is often shared with the other bird. The saltcedar is another invasive large weed that also, like the giant reed, uses large amounts of water. Unlike giant reed, the saltcedar has deeper roots, not only making it more difficult to remove but allowing it to access and use up deep groundwater. However, the saltcedar is similar in that it also provides little usable habitat for native animals.

==History==

===First peoples===
Human habitation on the Santa Ana River dates back 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, close to the early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to live in the area were nomadic tribes that traveled from place to place, grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally nomadic tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming semi-nomadic. However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer to the ocean often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.

Several major premodern Native American groups eventually gained control of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived in the mountain headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, as well as in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin. These peoples established villages, some of which were multiethnic and multilingual, including Lupukngna, Genga, Pajbenga, Totpavit, and Hutuknga.

===Spanish period===

When Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed along the Southern California coast on his voyage of 1542, he passed the mouth of the Santa Ana River without noting it. Neither did any of the subsequent Spanish sea-borne explorers leave any written notice of the river mouth.

It was not until 1769 that Gaspar de Portolà led the first overland expedition northwards through coastal Southern California—still a largely unexplored part of the Alta California province of New Spain—and gave the river its name. On July 28, the party camped &quot;about three leagues&quot; from where the Santa Ana River exits the canyon through the northern Santa Ana Mountains, near present-day Olive. Fray Juan Crespí, one of the members of the expedition, wrote in his diary that he called the spot &quot;Jesus de los Temblores&quot;, referring to an earthquake that struck while they were camped alongside there. Crespi also noted that the soldiers were calling the river &quot;Rio de Santa Ana&quot;, probably because they had recently celebrated Saint Anne&#x27;s Day. That name remains today (the second oldest place name in Orange County, after Santiago Creek), and the name of the mountain range and city were derived from the river.

Although no missions were actually located along the Santa Ana River or within the watershed, the river basin was nearly depleted of native people because the Spanish forced them to work at nearby missions, including Mission San Gabriel Arcangel and Mission San Luis Rey. The affected tribes were usually renamed after the missions, resulting in tribal names such as Gabrieliño and Luiseño. Difficult working and living conditions and European diseases such as smallpox killed much of the native population during the roughly 50-year-long Mission Period. The Secularization Act of 1833, passed by the newly independent country of Mexico, eventually brought an end to the Mission Period. The post-Mission Period native population was almost entirely devastated. The population was very little, their native religions were nearly lost, and most of their land had been taken by Spanish settlers. Although the Mexican government&#x27;s original intention with the Secularization Act was to provide the Native Americans with their own land and property, most of the provisions made by the act never actually happened. Spanish settlers continued to press into the remaining tribal lands, and eventually, the tribes were forced into the surrounding desert lands or into the high mountains.

Following the Mission Period came the Rancho Period. This occurred when the enormous land holdings of the missions were subdivided into ranchos owned by individuals. Some of the new private ranchos were merely converted mission ranchos. The first private rancho along the Santa Ana River was Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, a rancho on the left bank of the lower Santa Ana River. This rancho was acquired by Don Juan Pablo Grijalva as early as 1801. Other ranchos on the river followed, including ones in inland areas that had not been exploited in the Mission Period. The ranchos (beginning with the missions) established the tradition of raising cattle in coastal Southern California, a custom upheld until the late 19th century. Agriculture, however, although established, was not yet a major industry. A flood that raged down the Santa Ana in 1825 caused the river&#x27;s course to change temporarily to an outlet at Newport Bay, depositing sediment that partially created Balboa Island. Spread throughout the ranchos on the Santa Ana River were a few towns, military outposts and trading posts. The Santa Ana River valley was one of the most prosperous regions in Southern California for many decades.

===American settlement===
In the late 1840s, California fought for its independence from Mexico in the Mexican–American War. The Santa Ana river played an important part in the victory of the Americans over the Mexican army. In 1847, one year after the Bear Flag Revolt, a Mexican military force set out northwards to attack a smaller American force in the Los Angeles area. However, the Santa Ana River flooded, preventing the Mexicans from crossing the river to attack the Americans. When the river&#x27;s flow finally subsided, the American forces had been reinforced enough to drive the Mexicans out of the region.
When the California Republic was assimilated into the United States in 1848, American settlers began to move into the Santa Ana River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale. The city of Santa Ana Viejo, the original location of Santa Ana, was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of San Bernardino, gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of these people to the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.

In 1860, a much closer gold rush occurred in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation in days. The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region and many of the forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting as a result of the high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.

===Floods, droughts and legacy===

Notwithstanding the increased prosperity in the 1860s, this decade was also the scene of a series of natural disasters. In the Great Flood of 1862, heavy rains dropped by a series of winter storms caused the Santa Ana to burst its banks, flooding thousands of acres of land and killing 20 to 40 people in the greatest flood it had experienced in recorded history. The levees along the river burst in many places, flooding part of the Inland Empire into a continuous body of water several miles wide stretching from the mouth of Santa Ana Canyon to where the river cuts through the Santa Ana Mountains. Downstream in Orange County, the river overwhelmed nearly all the existing floodworks and transformed the coastal plain into a transient inland sea. The flow, now calculated as a 1,000-year flood, peaked at roughly , over half the average flow of the Mississippi River. Even after the flood, detrimental conditions continued in the region. For the two years following the flood, an intense drought caused the deaths of tens of thousands of head of livestock. Despite all of the hardships experienced in the three years, after conditions finally returned to normal, the Santa Ana River watershed again became a prospering agricultural region. The cities of Santa Ana and Riverside were established in 1869 and 1870, respectively.

1934 and 1938 saw a further pair of devastating floods that in part brought an end to the area&#x27;s citrus industry. In the Los Angeles flood of 1938, the Santa Ana again burst its banks and flooded Anaheim and Orange in up to of water, stripping away thousands of acres of rich topsoil and destroying many of the citrus groves. Almost 60 people were killed in the disaster and about of land were flooded, despite the fact that the flow in the river was only one-third of that of the 1862 flood. With the extreme damage from the floods, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made the decision to dam and concrete the river beginning in the 1940s, and declared it as the greatest flood hazard in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River. Prado Dam, built in 1941, was designed to capture floodwaters from the Inland Empire about upstream from the river&#x27;s mouth. The dam&#x27;s impoundment, Prado Flood Control Basin, was designed to handle a 70-year flood.
With the increased flood protection afforded by the Prado Dam, major industrial development migrating south from the Los Angeles Basin, and the Southern California housing boom in the 1950s and 1960s, the Santa Ana River watershed began its third and final transition—from agricultural to urban. The population of the Santa Ana River basin increased dramatically, but brought with it the threat of greater damage from floods, somewhat compromising the protection afforded by Prado Dam. Because housing and urban areas encroached on the river&#x27;s historic floodplain—an area once occupied by farms—and the river became confined to a narrow channel—a flood similar to the ones surrounding the turn of the 20th century would cause much more damage. The construction of roads and buildings also heightened the runoff that would flow into the river during rainfall, a process known as urban runoff. In fact, the river flooded again in 1969, and while much of the runoff from the Inland Empire was captured behind Prado Dam—probably saving Orange County from an even greater flood—Santiago Creek, a large tributary flowing from the Santa Ana Mountains, eroded its banks until it swept away portions of residential communities in the cities of Tustin and Orange.

In 1964, the Santa Ana River Mainstem Project, which involved concreting the lower of the river, was first proposed. Construction work began in 1989, and today, through much of Orange County, the river&#x27;s channel is essentially an enormous box culvert. The second dam, Seven Oaks Dam, was completed in 1999. This dam captures flood runoff from Santa Ana Canyon before it can enter the Inland Empire. The dam was designed to withstand a 350-year flood. Today, the river lies mainly between levees and concrete channels, and especially in its lower course, functions only as a flood drainage channel.

==Pollution and restoration==

As with many Southern California rivers, the Santa Ana is heavily polluted and used. The main stem above Seven Oaks Dam is free-flowing, as are many of its upper tributaries. Once the river enters the Inland Empire basin, however, much of its flow is diverted for municipal and agricultural water use. Most of the flow in the river below the city of San Bernardino consists of effluent from 45 wastewater treatment plants and dry season urban runoff, which is collected behind Prado Dam. Any flow that makes it downstream to Orange County is diverted by another pair of dams into approximately of groundwater recharge basins, providing approximately of municipal water for the county every year, or one-third of its water supply. Downstream of that dam, the river gathers further urban runoff before finally making it into the Pacific. The Santa Ana River is included on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) list of &quot;304 (l) &#x27;toxic hot spots&#x27; list of impaired waterways&quot;.

In Orange County, the Orange County Water District, formed in 1932 to manage the county&#x27;s groundwater, uses the treated water from upstream to recharge a massive reservoir, or aquifer, that runs roughly nine miles from Lakeview Avenue to Ball Road. The water percolates through layers of sand and gravel, which work to scrub, or purify it. There, it joins treated wastewater pumped from the Orange County Sanitation Department&#x27;s state-of-the-art plant in Fountain Valley. Those two types of water account for 60 to 70 percent of the aquifer, which can hold 500,000 acre feet. Combined with water imported from Northern California and the Colorado River, the OCWD maintains that the aquifer could serve the water needs of all its clients for a year.

A number of organizations have been formed to try to gain public interest in restoring the river. One of the most prominent is the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), formed by five municipal water districts in the Santa Ana River area. A second one is the Santa Ana River Dischargers Association. Both have conducted studies as to what beneficial uses the Santa Ana River would have aside from water supply and flood control, as well as the removal of some of the concreted sections of the lower river. This set of studies is known as the &quot;Use-Attainability Analysis&quot;, which was submitted to the state Congress, which approved it. However, upon submission to the EPA, it was rejected. As a result, little work has been done to repair the ecological damage that has been caused by urbanization along the river. Other projects include the Santa Ana Watershed Planning Advisory Committee, and the Santa Ana River Watershed Alliance (SARWA).

==Recreation==

There are many recreational opportunities along the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River watershed includes parts of the Cleveland National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount San Jacinto State Wilderness Area, Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river never actually flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.

The Santa Ana River bicycle path which, when complete, will run from the river&#x27;s mouth at Huntington Beach to near the San Bernardino Mountains, currently extends about along the river to Prado Dam. The proposed distance along the trail is over . In Riverside County, the Hidden Valley Wildlife Area also has of recreational paths. Some entities have been opting for a Santa Ana River Park, which would encompass a strip of land on either side of the river for its entire course. The city of Redlands would like to develop riverside green space near the historic downtown district. The Santa Ana River Lakes, located near Anaheim, are a popular recreational fish farm fed with water from the river. Ultimately, the trail could link a network of river-bottom parks. In 2014, naturalists navigated the stretch of river flanked by Chino Hills State Park on the north and the Cleveland National Forest on the south. The rafts made it before the vegetation was impenetrable but they were convinced there were possibilities of improving public access and recreational opportunities.

<doc id="695923" wikidata="Q2367048" url="?curid=695923" title="SuperCard">
<text>SuperCard was a high-level development environment that ran on Macintosh computers, under OS 8 and 9, and OS X. It was inspired by HyperCard, but included a richer language, a full GUI toolkit, and native color (as opposed to HyperCard&#x27;s Apple- or third-party-supplied add-ons).

The programming language used by SuperCard was called SuperTalk, and was largely based on HyperTalk, the language in HyperCard. In addition to the core language, SuperTalk could call out to OSA-based scripting languages such as AppleScript, and shell commands. The language could be extended with so-called externals, chunks of compiled code that appeared like native routines.

Programs created using SuperCard could be run inside the IDE itself, or as &quot;standalones&quot;, which combined the user-created programs and resources with the execution engine used by SuperCard.

==History==
===The early years===
SuperCard was first created by Bill Appleton and published by Silicon Beach Software in 1989. Appleton combined elements from World Builder (that he wrote), HyperCard, SuperPaint and the Macintosh user interface.

In 1990, Silicon Beach was acquired by Aldus Corporation. Aldus released version 1.6 of SuperCard which brought support for AppleEvents, enhanced graphic capabilities and several other improvements.

===Mid-1990s===
In February 1994, Allegiant Technologies of San Diego bought SuperCard. Allegiant released several versions of the software, and even won the 1995 MacUser Editor&#x27;s Choice for Best New Multimedia-Authoring Application. Version 1.7 of SuperCard, which was released in June 1994, included several important enhancements, including QuickTime support and switch statements. In December of the same year, version 2.0 was released. This was the first PowerPC native version, which made it a lot faster than previous versions on newer machines. Also, this version introduced an application called Standalone Maker, which put a front end on the ability to edit the resource fork of executable SuperCard projects. SuperCard had always been able to produce stand alone executable applications, but this tool lowered the barrier to entry for novice users. Version 2.0 and 2.5 were released in Japanese-language versions. Version 2.5 also added full 24-bit color, and QuickTime VR support.

===Late 1990s===
Several versions of SuperCard were released thereafter, that included features such as support for full 24-bit color and improvements of the filmstrip feature. In early 1996, a new companion product called Marionet was released. This add-on allowed projects to communicate over local networks or the Internet, offering server-side functionality and foreshadowing the robust web application era of today.

 Twenty months later, the third version of SuperCard was released. This new version sported a new project file format supporting user properties, and a completely new Project Editor.

Allegiant&#x27;s goal was to keep innovating on the Macintosh product, while delivering a Windows runtime environment (edit on the Mac, run on Windows or Mac) and ultimately a Windows authoring environment. The firm went through three different attempts to bring a Windows version of SuperCard to the public. The first was a true &quot;port&quot; of the product (which would have included both editing and runtime environments on Windows), but it was taking too long and was very unstable due to the lack of a robust graphical &quot;toolbox&quot; such as the one offered on the Mac platform. It was determined that it would be unfeasible to use the Macintosh source code as a basis for porting to Windows at the time, so a second was an attempt to make a runtime-only environment that supported most of the capabilities of SuperCard, but under a brand new code base that was written from the ground up with new engineers. This version was more stable, but ultimately did not make it to market (although it formed the basis for the Roadster plugin (see below)). The third attempt was very short-lived, but was based on conversations with Apple related to QuickTime Interactive (QTi), which was going to provide a Quicktime-based environment that could be used to create a Quicktime-based development and authoring tool using the SuperTalk language.

Ultimately, the firm also created a SuperCard browser plugin called &quot;Roadster&quot; in 1996 to run &quot;projects&quot; — the SuperCard version of stacks. Roadster supported a subset of SuperCard&#x27;s capabilities, but since it was a web plugin, it was the first time that SuperCard content could be played on Windows.

In May 1998, Incwell DMG acquired SuperCard and all related products from Allegiant. Shortly thereafter, version 3.5 was announced. This version, which was finally released in October 1998, was faster than its predecessors, and had support for QuickTime 3, Drag and Drop, and more. Incwell also cut the price in half compared to previous versions.

Version 3.6, released in 1999, brought a Japanese version and many internal improvements.

===The 21st century===
In 2002, SuperCard was acquired for the fourth time. This time, Solutions Etcetera, the company that had been developing SuperCard for IncWell, bought the product, and announced version 4. This new version introduced Mac OS X support, complete theme compliance and a wide range of user interface elements to go with it.

Since then, versions up to 4.8 were released, bringing improvements and bug fixes, native support for Apple&#x27;s Intel-Chip-Based Macs, IDE enhancements, extended numeric precision, anti-aliased draw graphics, and expanded shell support.

As of March 2023, SuperCard 4.8.1 was not compatible with macOS Catalina or later due to the removal of 32-bit application support in macOS.

As a result of the passing of Scott Simon, co-owner of Solutions Etcetera, in April 2024, the SuperCard web site and that of its parent company were taken down. This brought to an end the 36-year history of the product. The clear turning point in SuperCard&#x27;s commercial viability was Solutions Etcetera&#x27;s decision not to follow Apple&#x27;s development roadmap. After MacOS dropped support for 32-bit applications in 2012 (OS X Mountain Lion), SuperCard could only be run on obsolete hardware (defined as officially unsupported by Apple), or under emulated environments on modern hardware. This, combined with the rise of competing, more modern, cross-platform authoring alternatives and frameworks vastly diminished the potential customer base.

<text>Energizer Holdings, Inc. is an American manufacturer and one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of batteries, headquartered in Clayton, Missouri. It produces batteries under the Energizer, Ray-O-Vac, Varta, and Eveready brand names and formerly owned several personal care businesses until it separated that side of the business into a new company called Edgewell Personal Care in 2015.

In January 2018, Energizer announced it was purchasing the global battery and lighting division from Spectrum Brands, which includes the Ray-O-Vac and Varta brands, for $2 billion in cash. This acquisition was finalized in January 2019 after a lengthy regulatory approval process.

== History ==

The company has its foundation in the Eveready Battery Company, which in 1980 changed the name of its Eveready Alkaline Power Cell to Energizer. In 1986, corporate parent Union Carbide sold Eveready Battery to Ralston Purina. In 2000, Ralston spun off Eveready, and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Energizer Holdings, Inc.

In 2003 under the leadership of then chief executive officer J. Patrick Mulcahy, Energizer Holdings started expanding into the personal care product sector by buying personal care and razor brand Schick and razor brand Wilkinson Sword from Pfizer.

In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Energizer worked with the Red Cross to donate flashlights, batteries, razors, and funds to help Hurricane Katrina relief workers and victims. On November 3, 2005, Energizer Holdings Inc. said that higher sales of its Schick razors and blades partially offset lower sales of its batteries in North America. On a constant-currency basis, sales at Energizer rose 4 percent in its fourth quarter.

In October 2007, the company acquired Playtex Products, Inc. for $1.9 billion. The purchase included sunscreen brand Hawaiian Tropic, which Playtex had bought a few months earlier, and Sun Pharmaceuticals Corp., which manufactures the Banana Boat sunscreen products.

In 2009, Energizer acquired Edge and Skintimate shaving gels from S.C. Johnson &amp; Son.

In 2010, the company released a new &quot;Energizer Advanced Lithium&quot; line as their top-performing product series.

The company has licensed the Energizer name to Avenir Telecom, which has sold mobile phones and accessories under the Energizer brand name since the 2010s.

In October 2010, Energizer announced it was the winning bidder for the privately held American Safety Razor in a bankruptcy court auction.

On October 19, 2012, Energizer Holdings said it was withdrawing 23 varieties of its Banana Boat brand of UltraMist spray-on sunscreen lotion from stores due to the risk of it igniting when exposed to fire.

On July 31, 2013, Energizer bought the Stayfree, Carefree, and o.b. brands from Johnson &amp; Johnson for $185 million. The purchase was only for the brands in North America – Johnson &amp; Johnson continues to own the brands in all other regions of the world.

On April 30, 2014, Energizer announced that by September 2015, it would separate its two lines of business into two publicly traded companies. With revenue of $1.9 billion in the latest fiscal year, the household business would have Energizer chairman J. Patrick Mulcahy as its chairman and unit chief Alan Hoskins as CEO. It would sell batteries, flashlights, and lamps. The personal care company, whose revenue was $2.6 billion, would have Energizer CEO Ward Klein serving as chairman and current unit head David Hatfield as CEO, and would sell feminine products from Playtex, Carefree, o.b. and Stayfree; shaving products from Schick, Edge, Skintimate and Wilkinson Sword; and suntan products from Hawaiian Tropic and Banana Boat.

In 2016, Energizer acquired HandStands Holding Corporation, a leading designer and marketer of automotive fragrance and appearance products. 2018 Energizer expanded its auto care portfolio with the Nu Finish auto appearance brands.

In January 2018, Energizer announced it was purchasing the global battery and lighting division from Spectrum Brands, which includes the Ray-O-Vac and Varta consumer batteries brands, for $2 billion in cash. This acquisition was finalized in January 2019. However, in May of the same year, the EU antitrust authorities ordered the household battery production of the Varta brand to be let go. Varta quickly bought this to reunite the brand, though Energizer still holds the VARTA brand for the Latin America and Asia Pacific markets.

In 2024, Energizer bought the naming rights to CityPark, the home of Major League Soccer team St. Louis City SC, renaming the stadium to Energizer Park. The company moved its headquarters to Clayton, Missouri in November 2024.

==Operations==

, Energizer has six operational facilities in the United States. It also has a manufacturing facility in Singapore since 1946, supplying the Asia and Oceania markets.
Singapore is home to Energizer&#x27;s largest international plant, which is also the only Energizer facility outside the United States capable of producing alkaline and lithium batteries.

<doc id="695926" wikidata="Q1063006" url="?curid=695926" title="Tama River">
<text>The is a major river in Yamanashi, Kanagawa and Tokyo Prefectures on Honshū, Japan. It is officially classified as a Class 1 river by the Japanese government. It is long, and has a basin.

The river flows through the Greater Tokyo Area, on the dividing line between Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefectures. In Tokyo, its banks are lined with parks and sports fields, making the river a popular picnic spot.

== Course ==
The Tama&#x27;s source is on Mt. Kasatori in Koshu in Yamanashi Prefecture. From there, it flows eastward into mountainous western Tokyo, where the Ogōchi Dam forms Lake Okutama. Below the dam, it takes the name Tama and flows eastwards through Chichibu Tama Kai National Park to the city of Ōme. It then flows southeast between Tama Hills and Musashino Terrace. At Hamura is the source of the historic Tamagawa Aqueduct built by the Tamagawa brothers in 1653 to supply water to Edo (present day Tokyo). Further downstream, the river forms the boundary between Tokyo and the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. Its mouth on the heavily industrialised Tokyo Bay is next to Haneda Airport.

== Flooding ==
Tama River is very prone to flooding, and has wrought havoc on surrounding areas throughout history. On occasions the river even changed its course after massive floods, sometimes dividing pre-existing settlements in two. As a result, there are several locations where the place names on opposing sides of the river are the same, such as Todoroki. The current course was set as a result of a 1590 flood.

Levees have been in place for hundreds of years, but floodwaters have breached them numerous times in history. Extensive engineering projects in the early 20th century have dramatically reduced the amount of flood damage, although a 1974 typhoon caused floodwaters to burst a levee in Komae, washing away 19 houses. The levees have not been breached since 1974. Projects to further upgrade the levees have been underway since 1990.

As with most major rivers in Japan, the levees are built some distance away from the river itself to accommodate the extra floodwater. The open expanse between the levees and the river in the middle is covered in grass and shrubbery, forming a useful belt of greenery and wide open space which is used as playing fields in many places. Despite this extra space, the large amount of floodwater produced by Typhoon Hagibis in October 2019 flooded areas of Kawasaki City&#x27;s Musashi-Kosugi Station and nearby areas, causing infrastructural damage and power outages.

== Wildlife ==
Rapid post-war urbanization of surrounding areas took its toll on Tama River, whose water quality in the urban areas plummeted from the 1950s onwards rendering it uninhabitable for most species. Pollution control measures and the river&#x27;s official designation as a wildlife protection zone have now led to the return of many species.

Carp, rainbow trout, cherry salmon, &quot;iwana&quot; (char), &quot;ugui&quot; (big-scaled redfin) and ayu all inhabit Tama River in sufficient numbers for limited commercial fishing to take place in upstream areas. Recent moves to fit weirs with fish ladders have resulted in a steep increase in the numbers of ayu migrating upstream. Other fish, such as loach inhabit the river, as do crabs, turtles and crayfish.

Japanese cormorants, kingfishers, white wagtails, eastern spot-billed ducks, grey herons, little egrets, Japanese white-eyes, mandarin ducks, and black-headed gulls are among birds often seen at the river. Various types of ducks have made a comeback after the 1969 designation of the river as a wildlife protection zone. The expanse of greenery between the levees and the river itself attract additional wildlife.

In the summer of 2002, Tama-chan, a normally arctic male bearded seal first spotted in the Tama River by the Maruko Bridge, became a major nationwide celebrity.

In recent years the Tama River has been settled by a larger number of non-native species including red-eared slider turtles and tropical fish like piranhas. It is assumed that life for tropical fish became possible because of higher water temperature of river due to global warming and waste water from sewage treatment plants. Those higher temperatures now allow tropical pet fish abandoned by their owners to survive the cold Japanese winters. In the early 2000s, a Kawasaki man named Mitsuaki Yamasaki established a &quot;fish shelter&quot; to house pet fish that owners would otherwise dump into the river.

A large number of stray cats live along the river.

==Homeless==
Some homeless people live near the Tama River.

== Recreation ==
Near the outskirts of Tokyo, the river is a popular kayaking spot, with the Japan National Slalom Kayak competitions being held on the Tama River where it passes through Mitake.

This section of river is also a budding white water rafting and hydrospeeding destination being so accessible from Tokyo. Companies operate from early spring until late autumn.

The boulders on the riverbed around Mitake also form one of Tokyo&#x27;s premier climbing (bouldering) spots. Some of Japan&#x27;s famous boulder problems can be found here, on boulders such as &#x27;Ninja rock&#x27; and &#x27;Deadend&#x27;.

Further down, sports fields appear on both banks of the river, with many teams practicing or playing a range of sports here on a regular basis, including baseball, soccer and rugby union. (There is a rugby club named after the river, called Tamariba Club.) There are also many playgrounds, park spaces and golf driving ranges found on the side of the river as it passes through the city.

A bike path and running track travels the length of the river through urban Tokyo, extending to the river mouth in Tokyo bay.

==Redevelopment==
The areas around Tama River on both sides have generally been suburban in nature, with a few low to mid-rise office buildings. High-rises were virtually nonexistent until the late 2000s, with the bottoming of Tokyo&#x27;s two-decade-long real estate bubble collapse. This has changed with increased rail passenger services due to double tracking and line extensions and thru-services. The skyline has visibly changed at Futako-Tamagawa Station and Musashi-Kosugi Station but there are also renewed developments from Keio-Tamagawa Station area downstream as the combination of urban convenience and wide open river space is an uncommon amenity in Tokyo&#x27;s typically claustrophobic urban area.

== Other names ==
*Ichinose-gawa (Ichinose River) – its upper stream
*Taba-gawa (Taba River) – its upper stream
*Rokugo-gawa (Rokugo River) – near its mouth

==Gallery==
== Man-made lakes ==
*Lake Okutama
*Shiromaru Lake

==In popular culture and media==
The live-action outdoor night scenes from the opening FMV sequence of the original first Resident Evil video game (known in Japan as &quot;BIOHAZARD&quot;, where initial development and filming of all FMV scenes took place) were filmed near a riverbank of Tama, in heavily grassed parts of the shore&#x27;s premises, roughly 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) away from Tokyo, sometime in late August/early September 1995. Filming at Tama was done in roughly 12 hours and lasted from 17:00 to 05:00 the next day.

The asteroid 1089 Tama was named after the Tama River.

The River was featured heavily in the manga and anime series 365 Days to the Wedding.

<text>John Joseph Edward Cassidy (March 5, 1927 – December 12, 1976) was an American actor, singer and theatre director. He received multiple Tony Award nominations and a win, as well as a Grammy Award, for his work on the Broadway production of the musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot;. He also received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. He was the father of teen idols David Cassidy and Shaun Cassidy.

==Early life==
Cassidy was born in New York City, the son of Charlotte (née Koehler) and William Cassidy. He was the youngest of five children. His father, an engineer at the Long Island Rail Road, was of Irish descent and his mother was of German ancestry.

==Career==
Cassidy achieved success as a musical performer on Broadway. He appeared in &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, &quot;Maggie Flynn&quot;, &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird...It&#x27;s a Plane...It&#x27;s Superman&quot;, and &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, for which he won a Tony Award. He also received Emmy Award nominations for his television performances in the 1967-68 CBS Television Network series &quot;He &amp; She&quot; and &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot;.

On television, he became a frequent guest star, appearing in such programs as &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; for an episode titled &quot;Murder in the Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973). Cassidy also appeared three times as a murderer on &quot;Columbo&quot; in the episodes &quot;Murder By the Book&quot; (1971, directed by the not-yet-famous Steven Spielberg, with teleplay by a young Steven Bochco), &quot;Publish or Perish&quot; (1974), and &quot;Now You See Him...&quot; (1976).

He co-starred with Ronnie Schell in a television revival of &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;. Cassidy also co-starred as an informer in the movie &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; with Clint Eastwood and provided the voice of Bob Cratchit for the pioneering animated television special &quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;.

His frequent professional persona was an urbane, witty, confident egotist with a dramatic flair, much in the manner of Broadway actor Frank Fay. Cassidy perfected this character to the extent that he was cast as John Barrymore in the feature film &quot;W.C. Fields and Me&quot;.

The role of the vain, shallow, buffoon-like newsman Ted Baxter on TV&#x27;s &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (1970–1977) was reportedly written with Cassidy in mind. Cassidy had played a similar buffoonish character in the 1967–1968 sitcom &quot;He &amp; She&quot;, but he turned down the role, feeling that it was not right for him; the part went to Ted Knight. Cassidy later appeared as a guest star in a 1971 episode as Ted&#x27;s highly competitive and equally egotistical brother Hal.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Cassidy was married twice. His first marriage in 1948 was to actress Evelyn Ward. Together they had a son, David, who later became a teen idol. They divorced in 1956 and in the same year Cassidy married singer and actress Shirley Jones. Cassidy and Jones had three sons, Shaun, Patrick, and Ryan. Cassidy&#x27;s eldest son, David, later starred with Jones in the musical sitcom &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. Son Shaun also became a teen idol in the late 1970s, starring in &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; series, and producing four top-40 records. Jones and Cassidy divorced in 1975.

Cassidy has 12 grandchildren: Katie Cassidy and Beau by his first son David.; Caitlin, Jake, Juliet, Caleb, Roan, Lila, and Mairin Cassidy by son Shaun; Cole and Jack by son Patrick; and, Meghan Mae by son Ryan. His grandson, Jack Cassidy, was a contestant on the singing competition television show The Voice in 2017.

===Mental health===
In his 1994 autobiography, &quot;C&#x27;Mon, Get Happy&quot;, Cassidy&#x27;s eldest son David wrote that he became increasingly concerned about his father in the last years of his life. The elder Cassidy, who suffered from bipolar disorder and alcoholism, was displaying increasingly erratic behavior. In 1974, his neighbors were shocked to see him fully naked, watering his front lawn in the middle of the afternoon. Cassidy&#x27;s second wife, Shirley Jones, described a similar incident when she found him sitting naked in a corner of their house, reading a book. Jones said to him that they had to get ready to do a show, and he calmly looked up and said, &quot;I know now that I&#x27;m Christ&quot;. In December 1974, Cassidy was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility for 48 hours. At that time, Jones found out that he had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

===Sexuality===
David Cassidy said his father was bisexual, citing personal accounts and reports, both anecdotal and published, of his father&#x27;s same-sex affairs, something neither he nor his siblings knew until after their father&#x27;s death. In her 2013 memoir, Shirley Jones wrote that Cassidy had many same-sex affairs, including one with Cole Porter.

==Death==
On December 11, 1976, Cassidy invited his ex-wife, Shirley Jones, to his home, an apartment in West Hollywood, California, for drinks, but she declined.

Early the next morning, Cassidy lit a cigarette and fell asleep on his Naugahyde couch. Asleep, he dropped the cigarette, igniting the couch. The flames spread throughout the apartment and building. At 6:15 a.m., the blaze was discovered by Deputy Sheriff John DiMatteo, who evacuated the building, and entered Cassidy&#x27;s apartment. A charred body was found near the front door of the apartment among the ashes, and was identified as Cassidy&#x27;s by dental records and a signet ring that he wore, bearing the Cassidy family crest. His remains were cremated and scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="695940" wikidata="Q6781681" url="?curid=695940" title="Marys River (Oregon)">
<text>Marys River is a tributary of the Willamette River in the U.S. state of Oregon. From its source at the confluence of its east and west forks near Summit, it flows generally southeast from the Central Oregon Coast Range to Corvallis.

==Name==
The origin of the name is uncertain, although it was used as early as 1846. Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, in the seventh edition of &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot; find no support for the suggestion that employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had earlier named the stream St. Marys River. Rather, they summarize two stories about the origin. One is that Adam E. Wimple, an early settler, named the stream for his sister. Wimple was hanged at Dallas, Oregon, in 1852 for murdering his wife, also named Mary. The other story is that Wayman St. Clair, who represented Benton County in the territorial legislature in the early 1850s, named the river for Mary Lloyd. She was said to have been the first white woman to cross the river.

In 1847, Joseph C. Avery began laying out a town at the confluence of Marys River with the Willamette River, and the place was called Marysville. In 1853, the legislature changed the name of the town to Corvallis, a compounding of Latin words meaning heart of the valley. Prior to settlement by European Americans, fur traders referred to the Mary&#x27;s River as Mouse River or Mice River. It is probable that nearby Marys Peak was named for the river.

==Course==
Marys River arises in western Benton County at above sea level and falls between source and mouth to an elevation of . The main stem, formed by the confluence of the East Fork Marys River and the West Fork Marys River, begins at about river mile 40 (RM 40) or river kilometer 64 (RK 64) north of Marys Peak in the Central Oregon Coast Range. The West Fork Marys River, which is long, rises at and flows south to join the East Fork. The East Fork, which is long, rises at and flows southwest to join the West Fork. Marys Peak rises to above sea level at .

From its source, the river flows south along the east side of Marys River Road, past the unincorporated community of Summit and under Oregon Route 180 at about from the mouth. Turning southeast, the river flows just south of Route 180, receiving Devitt Creek from the left before reaching the unincorporated community of Blodgett. Here, about from the mouth, it crosses under U.S. Route 20 and in quick succession receives Norton Creek from the left and the Tumtum River from the right. Turning south and then east, it passes the unincorporated community of Harris at about RM 26.5 (RK 42.6) before reaching the unincorporated community of Wren. Near Wren, it turns north, crosses under Route 20 again, turns east, receives Gellatly Creek and La Bare Creek, both from the left, and passes under Oregon Route 223 at about from the mouth.

Just east of Route 223, the river receives Read Creek from the left, then Blakesley Creek from the left at about RM 20 (RK 32) and soon turns sharply south. About from the mouth, it flows under Route 20 for the third time, immediately receives Woods Creek from the right and turns southeast. It soon passes under Oregon Route 34 where it receives Greasy Creek from the right. Marys River then flows southeast by Philomath, which lies to its left (north), receives Newton Creek from the left, and passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge at from the mouth. At about from the mouth, the river receives Muddy Creek from the right and turns northeast toward Corvallis. In Corvallis, it passes Marysville Golf Course and Mill Race on the right, receives Dunawi Creek and Oak Creek from the left, and passes Avery Park on the right about from the mouth. Shortly thereafter, it flows under Oregon Route 99W and enters the Willamette River near the larger river&#x27;s RM 132 (RK 212).

<doc id="695949" wikidata="Q324366" url="?curid=695949" title="Shaun Cassidy">
<text>Shaun Paul Cassidy (born September 27, 1958) is an American singer, actor, writer and producer. He has created and/or produced a number of television series including &quot;American Gothic&quot;, &quot;Roar&quot; and &quot;Invasion&quot;. Cassidy was also an executive producer and writer for NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;.

While in high school, Cassidy signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records, leading to his albums &quot;Shaun Cassidy&quot;, &quot;Born Late&quot;, &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, &quot;Room Service&quot;, and &quot;Wasp&quot;. Almost concurrently, Cassidy starred in the ABC television series &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot;, as well as &quot;Breaking Away&quot; and had a stint on the daytime soap &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

While appearing on Broadway in the hit musical drama &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, he wrote his first television pilot, &quot;American Gothic&quot;. In 2020, Cassidy returned to the stage with his one-man show &quot;The Magic of a Midnight Sky&quot;. Cassidy is the eldest son of Academy Award–winning actress Shirley Jones and Tony Award-winning actor Jack Cassidy.

He is the younger half-brother of David Cassidy.

==Early life, family and education==
Cassidy grew up in Los Angeles, California and New York City; he is the son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy. In addition to an elder half-brother, David Cassidy, he has two younger brothers, Patrick and Ryan Cassidy.
He attended boarding school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania at the Solebury School in Solebury Township, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School.

== Career ==

=== Singer and recording artist ===

While still in high school, Cassidy signed a contract with Mike Curb&#x27;s division of Warner Bros. Records and began recording music. He scored a couple of hit singles in several countries, leading to an American release of his first solo album, &quot;Shaun Cassidy&quot;, in 1977. The multi-platinum album netted him a number-one U.S. single with &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The Eric Carmen–penned &quot;That&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (which had already been a hit in Australia and Europe) was the follow-up single and peaked at No. 3. His popularity continued with the concurrent arrival of his television series, &quot;The Hardy Boys Mysteries&quot; (1977–1979).

Cassidy&#x27;s next album &quot;Born Late&quot; netted the hit &quot;Hey Deanie&quot; (#7), also written by Carmen, and a remake of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s &quot;Do You Believe in Magic?&quot; became a moderate hit for Cassidy, peaking at No. 31.

Cassidy had released two successful albums, but by the release of his third album, 1978&#x27;s million-seller &quot;Under Wraps&quot;, AM radio was in decline and his teen-star appeal had begun to fade. His next album, &quot;Room Service&quot;, failed to chart on the US Billboard 200. Cassidy tried a different musical approach for his final release, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Wasp&quot;. This album was more rock/pop-oriented and produced by Todd Rundgren with the group Utopia as the backing band. It featured songs written by Rundgren, Cassidy, and cover versions of songs including David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rebel, Rebel&quot; and The Who&#x27;s &quot;So Sad About Us&quot; among others.

=== Actor ===

Cassidy concentrated on stage acting for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. He appeared on Broadway and West End productions such as &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; and &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, as well as the American premiere of &quot;Pass/Fail&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Cassidy won a Drama-Logue Award for his work in Mark Sheriden&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Hunger Strike&quot; at the Los Angeles Theater Center, and his final stage appearance was opposite his half-brother David in the Broadway production of &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (which successfully ran for over a year on Broadway, landing Cassidy on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine for the third time). It was during this production that Cassidy wrote his first television pilot, &quot;American Gothic&quot;, opening the door to a long-term contract with Universal Television.

=== Writer and producer ===
Since then, Cassidy has created, written, and produced numerous shows for network and cable including &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1995–1996, produced with Sam Raimi), &quot;Roar&quot; (1997, starring Heath Ledger), &quot;Cover Me&quot; (2000–2001), &quot;Invasion&quot; (2005–2006), &quot;Ruby &amp; The Rockits&quot; (2009, starring his brothers Patrick and David) and &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; (2018–2023, starring Ryan Eggold) on NBC.

In 2021, Cassidy took his one-man show &quot;The Magic of a Midnight Sky&quot; to the stage, playing to standing-room-only crowds nationwide, his first live music performance in almost forty years.

== Personal life ==
Cassidy has been married three times and has eight children. He married Ann Pennington, a model and former &quot;Playboy&quot; playmate, in 1979 and divorced in 1993; they had two children together.

Cassidy married actress Susan Diol in 1995 and divorced in 2003; they have one daughter.

In 2004, he married producer Tracey Lynne Turner; they have four children.

<doc id="695950" wikidata="Q9297784" url="?curid=695950" title="Free cash flow">
<text>In financial accounting, free cash flow (FCF) or 
free cash flow to firm (FCFF) is the amount by which a business&#x27;s operating cash flow exceeds its working capital needs and expenditures on fixed assets (known as capital expenditures). It is that portion of cash flow that can be extracted from a company and distributed to creditors and securities holders without causing issues in its operations. As such, it is an indicator of a company&#x27;s financial flexibility and is of interest to holders of the company&#x27;s equity, debt, preferred stock and convertible securities, as well as potential lenders and investors.

Free cash flow can be calculated in various ways, depending on audience and available data. A common measure is to take the earnings before interest and taxes, add depreciation and amortization, and then subtract taxes, changes in working capital and capital expenditure. Depending on the audience, a number of refinements and adjustments may also be made to try to eliminate distortions.

Free cash flow may be different from net income, as free cash flow takes into account the purchase of capital goods and changes in working capital and excludes non-cash items.

==Calculations==
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of performance. As such, there are many ways to calculate free cash flow. Below is one common method for calculating free cash flow:

Note that the first three lines above are calculated on the standard statement of cash flows.

When net profit and tax rate applicable are given, you can also calculate it by taking:

where
* Net capital expenditure (CAPEX) = Capex − Depreciation and amortization
* Tax shield = Net interest expense × Marginal tax rate

When Profit After Tax and Debt/Equity ratio are available:
where d is the debt/equity ratio, e.g. for a 3:4 mix it will be 3/7.

Therefore,

==Difference with net income==
There are two differences between net income and free cash flow. The first is the accounting for the purchase of capital goods. Net income deducts depreciation, while the free cash flow measure uses last period&#x27;s net capital purchases.

The second difference is that the free cash flow measurement makes adjustments for changes in net working capital, where the net income approach does not. Typically, in a growing company with a 30-day collection period for receivables, a 30-day payment period for purchases, and a weekly payroll, it will require more working capital to finance the labor and profit components embedded in the growing receivables balance.

When a company has negative sales growth, it&#x27;s likely to lower its capital spending. Receivables, provided they are being timely collected, will also ratchet down. All this &quot;deceleration&quot; will show up as additions to free cash flow. However, over the long term, decelerating sales trends will eventually catch up.

The net free cash flow definition should also allow for cash available to pay off the company&#x27;s short term debt. It should also take into account any dividends that the company means to pay.

Net free cash flow = Operation cash flow − Capital expenses to keep current level of operation − dividends − Current portion of long term debt − Depreciation

Here, capex definition should not include additional investment on new equipment. However, maintenance cost can be added.

Dividends will be the base dividend that the company intends to distribute to its share holders.

Current portion of long term debt will be the minimum debt that the company needs to pay in order to not default.

Depreciation should be taken out since this will account for future investment for replacing the current property, plant and equipment (PPE).

If the net income category includes the income from discontinued operation and extraordinary income make sure it is not part of free cash flow.

Net of all the above give free cash available to be reinvested in operations without having to take more debt.

==Alternative formula==
FCF measures:
* Operating cash flow (OCF)
* Less expenditures necessary to maintain assets (capital expenditures or &quot;capex&quot;), but this does not include increase in working capital.
* Less interest charges.
In symbols:
:formula_1

where
* &quot;OCB&quot;&quot;t&quot; is the firm&#x27;s net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) during period &quot;t&quot;
* &quot;I&quot;&quot;t&quot; is the firm&#x27;s investment during period &quot;t&quot; including variation of working capital

Investment is simply the net increase (decrease) in the firm&#x27;s capital, from the end of one period to the end of the next period:
:formula_2

where &quot;K&quot;&quot;t&quot; represents the firm&#x27;s invested capital at the end of period &quot;t&quot;. Increases in non-cash current assets may, or may not be deducted, depending on whether they are considered to be maintaining the status quo, or to be investments for growth.

Unlevered free cash flow (i.e., cash flows before interest payments) is defined as EBITDA − CAPEX − changes in net working capital − taxes. This is the generally accepted definition. If there are mandatory repayments of debt, then some analysts utilize levered free cash flow, which is the same formula above, but less interest and mandatory principal repayments. The unlevered cash flow (UFCF) is usually used as the industry norm, because it allows for easier comparison of different companies’ cash flows. It is also preferred over the levered cash flow when conducting analyses to test the impact of different capital structures on the company.

Investment bankers compute free cash flow using the following formulae:

FCFF = After tax operating income + Noncash charges (such as D&amp;A) − CAPEX − Working capital expenditures = Free cash flow to firm (FCFF)

FCFE = Net income + Noncash charges (such as D&amp;A) − CAPEX − Change in non-cash working capital + Net borrowing = Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)

Or simply:

FCFE = FCFF + Net borrowing − Interest*(1−t)

Free cash flow can be broken into its expected and unexpected components when evaluating firm performance. This is useful when valuing a firm because there are always unexpected developments in a firm&#x27;s performance. Being able to factor in unexpected cash flows provides a financial model.

==Uses==
* Free cash flow measures the cash that a company will pay as interest and principal repayment to bondholders plus the cash that it &quot;could&quot; pay in dividends to shareholders if it wanted to. Even profitable businesses may have negative free cash flows. For example, a rapidly growing manufacturer with a positive cash conversion cycle will need to outlay cash to purchase inventory for profitable orders that it takes. The business can show a positive net income but have very negative cash flows as the cash gets stuck in the working capital cycle, namely inventory and accounts receivable.
* According to one version of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the intrinsic value of a company is the present value of all future expected free cash flows. In this case, the present value is computed by discounting the free cash flows at the company&#x27;s weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
* Some investors prefer using free cash flow instead of net income to measure a company&#x27;s financial performance and calculate the intrinsic value of the company, because free cash flow is more difficult to manipulate than net income. The problems with this approach are discussed in the cash flow and return of capital articles.
* The payout ratio is a metric used to evaluate the sustainability of distributions from REITs, Oil and Gas Royalty Trusts, and Income Trust. The distributions are divided by the free cash flow. Distributions may include any income, flowed-through capital gains or return of capital.

==Problems with capital expenditures==
* The expenditures for maintenances of assets is only part of the capex reported on the Statement of Cash Flows. It must be separated from the expenditures for growth purposes. This split is not a requirement under GAAP, and is not audited. Management is free to disclose maintenance capex or not. Therefore, this input to the calculation of free cash flow may be subject to manipulation, or require estimation. Since it may be a large number, maintenance capex&#x27;s uncertainty is the basis for some people&#x27;s dismissal of &#x27;free cash flow&#x27;.
* A second problem with the maintenance capex measurement is its intrinsic &#x27;lumpiness&#x27;. By their nature, expenditures for capital assets that will last decades may be infrequent, but costly when they occur. &#x27;Free cash flow&#x27;, in turn, will be very different from year to year. No particular year will be a &#x27;norm&#x27; that can be expected to be repeated. For companies that have stable capital expenditures, free cash flow will (over the long term) be roughly equal to earnings

==Agency costs==
In a 1986 paper in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, Michael Jensen noted that free cash flows allowed firms&#x27; managers to finance projects earning low returns which, therefore, might not be funded by the equity or bond markets. Examining the US oil industry, which had earned substantial free cash flows in the 1970s and the early 1980s, he wrote that:

[the] 1984 cash flows of the ten largest oil companies were $48.5 billion, 28 percent of the total cash flows of the top 200 firms in Dun&#x27;s Business Month survey. Consistent with the agency costs of free cash flow, management did not pay out the excess resources to shareholders. Instead, the industry continued to spend heavily on [exploration and development] activity even though average returns were below the cost of capital.

Jensen also noted a negative correlation between exploration announcements and the market valuation of these firms—the opposite effect to research announcements in other industries.

<text>The Calapooia River is an tributary of the Willamette River in the U.S. state of Oregon.

The Calapooia flows generally northwest from its source in the Cascade Range near Tidbits Mountain. In its upper reaches, it passes through parts of the Willamette National Forest. Further downstream, it flows through Holley then Crawfordsville and Brownsville in the Willamette Valley before joining the Willamette at Albany. The city of Tangent is also near the river on a branch of one of its downstream tributaries, Lake Creek. The confluence of the two rivers is about by water from where the Willamette joins the Columbia River

The Calapooia was named for the Kalapuya (also spelled Calapooia), a tribe of Native Americans.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries of the river from source to mouth are Eighteen, Treadwell, and United States creeks followed by the North Fork Calapooia River. Then come King, Potts, Barrett/Hands, Washout, McKinley and Blue creeks. Further downstream are Biggs, Fox, Sweet Honey, Cedar, Pugh, Sawyer, Johnson, and Brush creeks. Finally come Warren, Cochrane, Courtney, Lake, and Oak creeks.

==Dams==

The Brownsville Dam was built in the late 1800s, later rebuilt as a small concrete dam. It was removed in 2007 to allow better fish passage and address safety concerns.

The small Sodom Dam and Shearer Dam were both removed in 2011, leaving the Calapooia River free of any human-made dams.

<text>Royal Air Force Gan, commonly known as RAF Gan, is a former Royal Air Force station on Gan island, the southern-most island of Addu Atoll, which is part of the larger groups of islands which form the Maldives, in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Its motto is &quot;En Route&quot;, which signifies its importance as a strategic staging post for enabling RAF aircraft to reach their onward destinations at their bases in the Far East.

Following the departure of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1976, the former RAF Gan airfield was developed into a civilian airport, and is now known as Gan International Airport.

==History==
The area was originally established as a military base for the Royal Navy (RN) in . Royal Navy engineers began constructing airstrips on Gan island from crushed coral in August 1941 for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Around this time, the original inhabitants of Gan were forcibly relocated to the nearby Feydhoo.

The airfield was operational between 1942 and 20 March 1945, as a secondary base for Trincomalee, Ceylon. It was part of HMS Haitan which became HMS Moraga.

During the Second World War, in 1942, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had its bases in the islands of Addu Atoll, Maldives. The RAF first had a presence on Hithadoo in 1942, when a detachment of RAF personnel were sent from RAF China Bay in Ceylon to service and turn around the RAF Short Sunderland and Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats that were flying regularly into the Addu Atoll lagoon. At the end of the war, all military installations were either removed or abandoned.

In 1956–57, at the request of SWRD Bandaranaike, the Royal Air Force handed over its bases in Ceylon to the Royal Ceylon Air Force. The loss of RAF Negombo meant that a replacement staging post was needed between its bases in the Middle East and Far East, and the location was virtually limited to Gan. Hence Royal Air Force Station Gan became established in the late 1950s as a stopover on the reinforcement route to the Far East Air Force based in Singapore. The previous reinforcement route had passed through countries that had formerly been British territory, but were now independent, and sometimes hostile nations. RAF Mauripur, to the west of Karachi, by then a Pakistan Air Force station, had RAF personnel attached for staging airfield purposes until 1956, when the staging role between the Middle East and Far East fell to RAF Gan.

It was extensively used as a staging post by bombers, fighters, and transports, on their way to Singapore and other destinations in east Asia during the late 1950s and the 1960s. Other foreign military forces occasionally used the facilities. However, as the 1970s dawned, the United Kingdom was withdrawing from its commitments east of Suez. By the end of 1971, the RAF Far East Air Force was disbanded, and the major rationale for Gan was gone. Traffic was now much less frequent, but the base still remained open for a few more years. By 1975, extremely few British military aircraft used the base, and it was closed. On 1 April 1976, the entire island with its airfield was handed back to the Maldivian Government. At the same time as RAF use of the airfield ceased, the RAF gained access to the newly built airfield to the south of Gan on the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) island of Diego Garcia. In 1977 the Soviet Union requested use of the Gan airbase, but this was denied by President Ibrahim Nasir, who wanted the Maldives to remain neutral.

The base was used by No. 1125 Marine Craft Unit between 1 May 1970 and 29 March 1976.

==RAF Gan today==
Following the handover back to the Maldivian Government, the island was left to fall into disrepair for many years, but as funds allowed the airfield was subtly developed into a civil airport now known as Gan International Airport. Most of the base is now a tourist resort called Equator Village: the former military buildings remain and have been converted into rooms and other facilities on the resort. The former military hospital is now a dive centre.

<text>Agustín Stahl (January 21, 1842 – July 12, 1917) was a Puerto Rican medical doctor and scientist with diverse interests in the fields of ethnology, botany, and zoology. He advocated Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence from Spain.

== Early years ==
Stahl was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and given the name Antón Adolf August, by his parents Johann Heinrich Christian Stahl and María Helene Stamm. Born into a Protestant family, he was baptized into the Catholic faith in Aguadilla at about three years of age, town where he also received his primary and secondary education.

He studied at the universities of Würzburg in Germany and at the Charles University in Prague, graduating from the latter with the title of Doctor of Medicine in 1864. After graduation, Stahl returned to Puerto Rico where he established his medical practice in the city of Bayamón.

== Ethnologist, botanist and zoologist ==
Outside work, Stahl&#x27;s love of nature lead him to conduct investigations and experiments in the fields of ethnology, botany and zoology. He also had a love of history and historical investigation.

Stahl wrote &quot;Estudios sobre la flora de Puerto Rico&quot; (A study of the Puerto Rican Flora), published in 6 fascicles from 1883 to 1888. Copies of Stahl&#x27;s plant collection with approximately 1,330 plants can be found in various botanical gardens around the world. His collections were the basis for numerous studies by specialists, some of them resulting in new taxa to science.

Stahl has a genus, &quot;Stahlia&quot;, and five valid species, &quot;Argythamnia stahlii&quot;, &quot;Senna pendula var. stahlii &quot;, &quot;Eugenia stahlii&quot;, &quot;Lyonia stahlii&quot;, and &quot;Ternstroemia stahlii&quot;, named in his honor. The genus Stahlia is represented by a single species, S. monosperma (Tul.) Urb., known to occur only in Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic. Known in Puerto Rico as Cóbana Negra, this species is currently listed as threatened in the USFW Federal Register, April 5, 1990. He was quoted as saying:

== Written works ==
Stahl&#x27;s written works include:

* &quot;Notes on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Flora&quot;
* &quot;Report on the Disease of the Sugar Cane&quot;
* &quot;Puerto Rican Flora&quot;
* &quot;The Puerto Rican Indians (Tainos)&quot; 
* &quot;The Founding of Aguadilla&quot;
* &quot;The Founding of Bayamón&quot;
== Later years ==
The custom of adorning Christmas trees in Puerto Rico began in the city of Bayamón in 1866 when Stahl adorned a tree in his back yard. The people of Bayamón baptized his tree &quot;El árbol de Navidad del Doctor Stahl&quot; (Dr. Stahl&#x27;s Christmas tree).

Stahl was a firm believer that Puerto Rico should obtain independence from Spain, and was a member of the &quot;Partido Autonomista Puertorriqueño&quot;, or Puerto Rican Autonomist Party. This group sought to create a separate political and legal identity for Puerto Rico while emulating Spain in all political matters. However, due to Stahl&#x27;s political views, he was expelled from his position in the Civil Institute of Natural Sciences in Spain and was deported from Spain in 1898.

Stahl died in the city of Bayamón and his remains are buried in Bayamón&#x27;s Cementerio Municipal Braulio Dueño Colón. The city of Bayamón turned his former house into a museum to be enjoyed by all those who wish to learn more about him and his work. The Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista created a bust to honor Stahl which can be found at the University of Cayey.

<doc id="695970" wikidata="Q1570049" url="?curid=695970" title="Code 128">
<text>Code 128 is a high-density linear barcode symbology defined in ISO/IEC 15417:2007. It is used for alphanumeric or numeric-only barcodes. It can encode all 128 characters of ASCII and, by use of an extension symbol (FNC4), the Latin-1 characters defined in ISO/IEC 8859-1. It generally results in more compact barcodes compared to other methods like Code 39, especially when the texts contain mostly digits. Code 128 was developed by the Computer Identics Corporation in 1981.
GS1-128 (formerly known as UCC/EAN-128) is a subset of Code 128 and is used extensively worldwide in shipping and packaging industries as a product identification code for the container and pallet levels in the supply chain.

==Specification==

A Code 128 barcode has seven sections:

# Quiet zone
# Start symbol
# Encoded data
# Check symbol (mandatory)
# Stop symbol
# Final bar (often considered part of the stop symbol)
# Quiet zone

The check symbol is calculated from a weighted sum (modulo 103) of all the symbols.

===Subtypes===
Code 128 includes 108 symbols: 103 data symbols, 3 start symbols, and 2 stop symbols. Each symbol consists of three black bars and three white spaces of varying widths. All widths are multiples of a basic &quot;module&quot;. Each bar and space is 1 to 4 modules wide, and the symbols are fixed width: the sum of the widths of the three black bars and three white bars is 11 modules.

The stop pattern is composed of two overlapped symbols and has four bars. The stop pattern permits bidirectional scanning. When the stop pattern is read left-to-right (the usual case), the stop symbol (followed by a 2-module bar) is recognized. When the stop pattern is read right-to-left, the reverse stop symbol (followed by a 2-module bar) is recognized. A scanner seeing the reverse stop symbol then knows it must skip the 2-module bar and read the rest of the barcode in reverse.

Despite its name, Code 128 does not have 128 distinct symbols, so it cannot represent 128 code points directly. To represent all 128 ASCII values, it shifts among three code sets (A, B, C). Together, code sets A and B cover all 128 ASCII characters. Code set C is used to efficiently encode digit strings. The initial subset is selected by using the appropriate start symbol. Within each code set, some of the 103 data code points are reserved for shifting to one of the other two code sets. The shifts are done using code points 98 and 99 in code sets A and B, 100 in code sets A and C and 101 in code sets B and C to switch between them):

* 128A (Code Set A)ASCII characters 00 to 95 (0–9, A–Z and control codes), special characters, and FNC 1–4
* 128B (Code Set B)ASCII characters 32 to 127 (0–9, A–Z, a–z), special characters, and FNC 1–4
* 128C (Code Set C)00–99 (encodes two digits with a single code point) and FNC1

The minimum width of the quiet zone to the left and right of the Code 128 is 10x, where &quot;x&quot; is the minimum width of a module. It is mandatory at the left and right side of the barcode.

===Start/stop and bar widths===
Each symbol in the barcode is composed of three bars and three spaces. Each bar or space is 1, 2, 3 or 4 units wide, the sum of the widths of bars must be even (4, 6 or 8 units), the sum of the widths of the spaces must be odd (3, 5 or 7 units), and total 11 units per symbol. For instance, encoding the ASCII character &quot;0&quot; can be viewed as 10011101100, where a sequence of 1&#x27;s is a bar and a sequence of 0&#x27;s is a space. A single 1 would be the thinnest line in the bar code. Three 1&#x27;s in sequence (111) indicates a bar three times as thick as a single 1 bar.

There are 108 possible 11-unit wide symbols, and the code uses all possible symbols. Two of the symbols are used for stop (end-of-barcode) indication, stop and reverse stop. The two stop symbols are special because they are always followed by a 2-unit bar, forming a 13-unit long stop pattern. Reading the stop pattern left to right is the stop symbol (followed by a 2-unit bar), and reading the stop pattern right to left is the reverse stop symbol (followed by a 2-unit bar).

===Check digit calculation===
The check digit is a weighted modulo-103 checksum. It is calculated by summing the start code &#x27;value&#x27; to the products of each symbol&#x27;s &#x27;value&#x27; multiplied by its position&#x27;s weight in the barcode string. The start symbol &quot;and&quot; first encoded symbol are in position 1. The sum of the products is then reduced modulo 103. The remainder is then converted back to one of the 103 non-delimiter symbols (following the instructions given below) and appended to the barcode, immediately before the stop symbol.

For example, in the following table, the code 128 variant A checksum value is calculated for the alphanumeric string PJJ123C:

So the value 54, which equals a V, is appended, then followed by the Stop code.

For the purpose of computing the check symbol, the shift and code-switch symbols are treated the same as any other symbol in the bar code.

===Using FNC4 to encode high (160–255) characters===

The special symbol FNC4 (&quot;Function 4&quot;), present only in code sets A and B, can be used to encode all the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) characters in a Code 128 barcode. 

When a single &#x27;FNC4&#x27; is present in a string, the following symbol is read like ASCII, but the value is incremented by +128, thus taking the higher range of the ISO-8859-1 table. If the following symbol is a &#x27;SHIFT&#x27;, then a second symbol will be used to obtain the character.

If two consecutive &#x27;FNC4&#x27; characters are used, all following data characters are extended ASCII characters until two further consecutive &#x27;FNC4&#x27; characters are encountered or the end of the symbol is reached. If during this sequence of extended encodation a single &#x27;FNC4&#x27; character is encountered it is used to revert to standard ASCII encodation for the next data character only. &#x27;SHIFT&#x27; and character subset characters shall have their normal effect during such a sequence.

From Code 128A you can reach Latin-1 special characters from 160 (hex A0, non breaking space) up to 223 (hex DF, ß) via FNC4. The lower case characters from 224 (hex E0, à) to 254 (hex FE, þ) are available by FNC4+SHIFT B. The characters ÷ (247, hex F7) and ÿ (255, hex FF) are not available. 

The feature is not available for GS1-128. Since the support of Code 128 Type B (and C) is not very common, it might be easier to use a QR Code instead for characters from the ISO-8859-1 code range.

===Bar code widths=== 
Code128 specifies a combination of 6 alternating bars and spaces (3 of each) for each symbol. Thus, each symbol begins with a bar and ends with a space. In barcode fonts, the final bar is generally combined with the stop symbol to make a wider stop pattern. The following table details the widths associated with each bar and space for each symbol. The width of each bar or space may be 1, 2, 3 or 4 units (modules). Using the example above, an &#x27;A&#x27; would be depicted with the pattern 10100011000, or as widths 111323 in the tables below.

The widths value is derived by counting the length of each run of 1&#x27;s then 0&#x27;s in the pattern, starting from the left. There will always be 6 runs and the lengths of these 6 runs form the Widths value. For example, using the pattern 10100011000, the run lengths are 1 (digit 1), 1 (digit 0), 1 (digit 1), 3 (digit 0), 2 (digit 1), 3 (digit 0). Reporting just the lengths of each run gives 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, thereby producing a widths value of 111323.

The &quot;Code A&quot;, &quot;Code B&quot; and &quot;Code C&quot; symbols cause all following symbols to be interpreted according to the corresponding subcode (i.e. 128A, 128B or 128C). The &quot;Shift&quot; symbol switches a single following symbol&#x27;s interpretation between subcodes A and B.

The encoded ASCII char depends on the actual used barcode-font. Especially the ASCII char of value 0 and of value 95 and above may be defined differently in the font that is installed.

The FNC&quot;x&quot; codes are used for special purposes. FNC1 at the beginning of a bar code indicates a GS1-128 bar code which begins with a 2- 3- or 4-digit &quot;application identifier&quot; assigned by the Uniform Code Council, which explains the following digits. For example, application identifier 421 indicates that an ISO 3166-1 numeric country code and ship-to postal code follows. Thus, the U.S. ZIP code for the White House would generally be printed as &quot;(421) 840 20500&quot;, but would actually be coded as &quot;codice_1&quot;

FNC2 (message append) can appear anywhere within a barcode to indicate that the barcode reader should store the current string and prepend it to the string of the next barcode that&#x27;s read. It is not used by GS1-128. 

FNC3 (initialize) can appear anywhere within a barcode to instruct the barcode reader to initialize or reprogram itself according to the barcode string&#x27;s instructions. 

FNC4 is used to represent an extended ASCII character set (see ). It is not used by GS1-128.

===Availability===
For the end user, Code 128 barcodes may be generated by either an outside application to create an image of the barcode, or by a font-based barcode solution. Either solution requires the use of an application or an application add in to calculate the check digit and create the barcode.

===Barcode length optimization by Code 128 Type-C===
Code set C uses one code symbol to represent two digits. Thus it may create shorter barcodes if the content consists of numbers only or if there are longer sequences of digits within the code.

However, when the string contains only a few digits or it&#x27;s mixed with non-digit character, it does not always produce a more compact code than code sets A or B. Using code set C saves one symbol per two digits, but costs a mode-shift symbol to enter and exit the set. Thus, it is only worth using if there are enough consecutive digits. For example, encoding the string &quot;X00Y&quot; with code set A or B requires 7 code symbols (codice_2), while using code set C for the &quot;X00Y&quot; would result in a code 8 symbols long (codice_3).

Using code set C is only advantageous under the following conditions:

At the end of a string, delaying the transition to code set C until there are an even number of digits remaining avoids an extra symbol. Consider the string &quot;...01234&quot;: a delayed switch produces codice_4 but an early switch produces codice_5.

For example, given the string &quot;098x1234567y23&quot;, savings on barcode length using code set C are achieved only if it is applied to middle part of the string. For the beginning and ending part of the string, switching to code set C is not effective. As there are an odd number of digits in the middle of the string, the odd one must use a different code set, but it makes no difference whether this is the first or last; 16 symbols are required in either case: codice_6, or codice_7.

Optimizing the length of the resulting barcode is important when barcode readers are used which must detect the entire barcode image at once in order to read it, such as common laser scanners. The longer the barcode is, the greater distance of laser barcode reader from barcode image is needed, making reading difficult or impossible above some threshold lengths/distances.

The optimal encoding can be found using a dynamic programming algorithm.

<doc id="695974" wikidata="Q657433" url="?curid=695974" title="Moving violation">
<text>A moving violation or traffic violation is any violation of the law committed by the driver of a vehicle while it is in motion. The term &quot;moving&quot; distinguishes it from other motor vehicle violations, such as paperwork violations (which include violations involving vehicle insurance, registration, and inspection), parking violations, or equipment violations. The United States Department of State makes reference to moving violations in its enforcement guidance.

== Types ==

While some violations, like parking violations, are civil matters involving a vehicle&#x27;s owner, moving violations are charged against the actual driver.

Moving violations are usually classified as infractions or misdemeanors, but serious violations such as hit and run, driving under the influence, and road rage can be considered felonies.

== Costs ==
Moving violation convictions typically result in fines and demerit points assessed to the license of the driver. As a driver accumulates points, they may be required to attend defensive driving lessons, re-take their driving test, pay additional taxes, or even surrender their license. Additionally, moving violations often increase insurance premiums. Drivers with more points on their driving record often must pay more for car insurance than drivers with fewer.

Sometimes tickets are used in a speed trap as a form of fundraising. For example, a local government that is suffering a budget shortfall may ticket more aggressively within its jurisdiction to increase revenue.

In the United States, citation fines can vary widely between jurisdictions for the same behavior, usually between $25 and $1,000. In countries such as Finland however, they are specific proportions of the violator&#x27;s income, and fines in excess of $100,000 can be assessed to wealthy individuals. In Canada, each province is individual in how they treat similar behavior and each violation usually includes a set fine and demerit points against the driver&#x27;s license. For example, a speeding ticket in Ontario of 50+ km over is 6 demerit points against the driver&#x27;s license with the approximate fine calculated as (km over x 9.75) x 1.25, as well it carries a one-week automatic license suspension and car impoundment. In Manitoba speeding in excess of 49 km is 10 demerit points and a fine of 672 dollars and a Serious Offence Licence Suspension.

==Examples of moving violations==

*Speeding, which can be exceeding a limit or (in some jurisdictions) simply driving at an unsafe speed
*Driving significantly below the speed limit to the point of obstructing traffic
*Tailgating or failing to maintain an assured clear distance ahead
*Driving or rolling past a stop sign or red traffic light without stopping
*Failure to yield to another vehicle with the right-of-way
*Failure to signal for turns or lane changes
*Improper lane usage, such as failing to drive within a single lane
*Crossing over a center divider, median, or gore
*Driving on the shoulder where it is considered illegal under certain conditions
*Failure to use a seat belt
*Illegal use of window tints and obstructions
*Failure to stop for a pedestrian in a crosswalk
*Failure to stop for a school bus when children are boarding or exiting (in certain jurisdictions)
*Failure to secure a load to a truck, lorry, or other vehicle
*Driving in a car pool lane illegally
*Operating a telecommunications device while driving (in jurisdictions that prohibit this)
*Driving a vehicle outside the conditions of one&#x27;s license
*Driving without a license or with a suspended license or with a license from another country
*Driving a vehicle in a bus lane or on railway tracks
*failure to stop after a traffic collision or make a report
*Driving on the wrong side of the road, unless there is an obstruction

More serious moving violations include:
*Driving under the influence
*Reckless driving or dangerous driving
*Street racing
*Vehicular homicide

=== Moving violations and driving records ===

Exactly how long moving violations stay on a driving record depends on jurisdictional laws; for example, in New York, minor moving violations can stay on a driving record abstract for a maximum of four years. Whereas minor moving violations tend to stay on a person&#x27;s abstract for only a few years, some serious moving violations are classified as criminal offenses that result in a criminal record that may be maintained for life.

<text>Xiangzhou District () is a district of the city of Xiangyang, Hubei, People&#x27;s Republic of China. The district itself was formerly known as Xiangyang (). It was a city famous for the siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273) by invading forces of the Mongol-founded Yuan Dynasty. It was also an important city during the period of the Three Kingdoms, in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; it was said that it was nearby Xiangyang that Zhuge Liang received his three visits from Liu Bei. Xiangyang was also where Sun Jian fought Liu Biao in 191 AD during the Three Kingdoms. Today, Xiangzhou has been incorporated with nearby Fancheng to form the prefecture-level city of Xiangyang, part of Hubei province.

<text>In road transport, a lane is part of a roadway that is designated to be used by a single line of vehicles to control and guide drivers and reduce traffic conflicts. Most public roads (highways) have at least two lanes, one for traffic in each direction, separated by lane markings. On multilane roadways and busier two-lane roads, lanes are designated with road surface markings. Major highways often have two multi-lane roadways separated by a median.

Some roads and bridges that carry very low volumes of traffic are less than wide, and are only a single lane wide. Vehicles travelling in opposite directions must slow or stop to pass each other. In rural areas, these are often called country lanes. In urban areas, alleys are often only one lane wide. Urban and suburban one lane roads are often designated for one-way traffic.

== History ==
For much of human history, roads did not need lane markings because most people walked or rode horses at relatively slow speeds. However, when automobiles, trucks, and buses came into widespread use during the first two decades of the 20th century, head-on collisions became more common.

The history of lane markings is connected to early mass automobile construction in Detroit. In 1906, the first Road Commission of Wayne County, Michigan was formed in an effort to make roads safer. (Henry Ford served on the board in the first year.) In 1909, the commission ordered the construction of the first concrete road (Woodard Avenue in Detroit), and conceived the centerline for highways in 1911. Hence, then chairman of the Road Commission, Edward N. Hines, is widely credited as the inventor of lane markings.

The introduction of lane markings as a common standard is connected to June McCarroll, a physician in Indio, California. She began experimenting with painting lines on roads in 1917 after being run off a highway by a truck driver. After years of lobbying by McCarroll and her allies, the state of California officially adopted a policy of painting lines on its highways in November 1924. A portion of Interstate 10 near Indio has been named the Dr. June McCarroll Memorial Freeway in her honor.

The first lane markings in Europe were painted at an accident hotspot in the small town of Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham, England, in 1921. The success of this experiment made its way to other hotspots and led to standardization of white paint lane markings throughout Great Britain.

The first use in Germany was in Berlin in 1925, where white paint marked both lanes and road edges. When the standard for the new autobahn network was conceived in the 1930s, it mandated the usage of black paint for the center line for each carriageway. Black is more visible on the bright surface of concrete.

By 1939, lane markings had become so popular that they were officially standardized throughout the United States. The concept of lane markings spread throughout the world and became standard for most roads. Originally, lines were drawn manually with ordinary paint which faded quickly. After World War II, the first machines for line markings were invented. Plastic strips became standard in the 1950s. This gradually led to the placement of plastic lane markings on all major roads.

== Types ==


===Basic types===
* A traffic lane or travel lane is a lane for the movement of vehicles travelling from one destination to another, not including shoulders.
* A through lane or thru lane is a traffic lane for through traffic (traffic continuing on a road or highway). At intersections, these may be indicated by arrows on the pavement pointing straight ahead. In some jurisdictions (Arizona) through lanes require straight directional lanes for at least two or more intersections to qualify as a proper through lane.
* An auxiliary lane is a lane other than a through lane, used to separate entering, exiting or turning traffic from the through traffic.
* An only lane prohibits or requires certain movements, often designated with the word &quot;ONLY&quot; on a sign or roadway, with arrows indicating allowed movements. Most require a specific turning movement, but some require straight-ahead travel or allow two out of three possible movements (such as turning right or going straight ahead). It can thus be either a through lane or a turn lane.
* A two-way center turn lane allows drivers travelling in either direction to stop before turning across oncoming traffic, safely waiting for a gap without blocking through traffic and risking a rear-end collision. Drivers are expected to check for oncoming traffic before entering.

===Passing lanes===
===Climbing lanes===
===Physically separated lanes===

Some high-volume limited-access highways use a local–express lane system. This physically separates express lanes for long-distance travel (closer to the median) from local lanes which have access to more frequent exits and entrances. Express lanes may have their own shoulders for safety, and sometimes dedicated entrance and exit ramps. (The term &quot;express lane&quot; is also used for HOV and toll lanes, which may or may not be physically separated.)

A frontage road is a similar arrangement, were one or more lanes are physically separated from a higher-speed road in order to provide safe and frequent access to local homes and businesses.

===Entering and exiting===

*Dedicated turn lanes can be used to allow through traffic to avoid waiting for turning traffic at intersections, at the expense of increased roadway width for pedestrians to hazard. Some turn lanes have signals that prevent turns when pedestrians or bicycles are allowed to proceed. On high-speed roads, turn lanes can improve safety by providing a separate lane for traffic that needs to slow down.
* A slip lane (UK: filter lane) allows vehicles to bypass an intersection and take an unsignalized turn when crossing traffic is not required (for example a right-hand turn for right-hand traffic). Yielding to traffic on the cross street is typically required.
* An acceleration lane or merge lane allows traffic entering a highway to accelerate to the speed of through traffic before merging with it.
* A deceleration lane is a lane adjacent to the primary road or street used to improve traffic safety by allowing drivers to pull out of the through lane and decelerate before turning off a surface street or exiting a highway or motorway.
* An operational lane or auxiliary lane combines an acceleration and deceleration lane, running the entire length between an entrance and exit. The lane is created when an entrance ramp meets the highway, and drops out (with an &quot;exit only&quot; sign) to become the ramp at the next exit.

===Non-travel lanes===
In some areas, the lane adjacent to the curb is reserved for non-moving vehicles.
* A parking lane is reserved for parallel parking of vehicles.
* A fire lane is the area next to a curb, which is reserved for firefighting equipment, ambulances, or other emergency vehicles. Parking in these areas, often marked by red lines, is usually prohibited.
* A loading lane (loading zone in the United States) is an area next to a curb, which is reserved for loading and unloading passengers or freight. It may be marked by a sign (&quot;LOADING ONLY&quot; or &quot;LOADING ZONE&quot;) or by a yellow or white-painted curb.
* A hard shoulder is sometimes called an emergency lane or a breakdown lane, when it is reserved for vehicle breakdowns, and for emergency vehicles. On some roads, the shoulder is used as a vehicle lane during peak travel hours. &quot;Hard&quot; refers to the fact that the shoulder is paved, not &quot;soft&quot; dirt.

===Managed lanes===

A reversible lane (contraflow lane) is a lane where the direction of traffic can be changed to match the peak flow. They are usually used where there are periods of high traffic, especially rush hour where the traffic is predominantly in one direction, and on roads that may be geographically constrained, such as over bridges. One or more lanes are removed from the opposing flow and added to the peak flow – this technique is known as tidal flow.

Dedicated lanes are traffic lanes set aside for particular types of vehicles:
* A high occupancy vehicle, 2+ lane or carpool lane is reserved for carpooling. In the UK, such lanes are not extremely common, although they do exist in many places—they are usually marked &quot;2+ LANE&quot;, referring to the fact that cars with two or more occupants may drive in the lane. In the US, they may be marked with a diamond icon every few hundred feet (hence the nickname &quot;diamond lane&quot;), or separated from other lanes by double broken white lines, a continuous pair of double yellow lines, or just a single broken white line.
* A high-occupancy toll lane is a combination of an HOV lane and toll collection technology that allows drivers without passengers to use the HOV lane by paying a premium price for the privilege
* A designated bicycle lane is a portion of the roadway or shoulder designated for the exclusive or preferential use of bicyclists. This designation is indicated by special word or symbol markings on the pavement and &quot;BIKE LANE&quot; signs.
* A motorcycle lane is provided at certain roads and highways such as the Federal Highway in Malaysia to segregate the motorcycle traffic from the main roadways to reduce motorcycle-related accidents. The motorcycle lane may form a part of the hard shoulder, or may be one or more completely separated lanes.
* A bus lane is reserved for buses providing public transportation on a fixed route, sometimes with overhead catenary for trolleybuses. In some countries, such as in the UK when signposted, bus lanes may also be used by some other traffic, such as taxis, bicycles and motorbikes.
* A tram lane is a lane reserved for the use of buses, trams and taxicabs. It is usually encountered in cities with curbside tram network, such as Zagreb.
* A truckway is a dedicated lane for longer length trucks; for instance, the Florida Turnpike allows 96-foot long double trailer combinations, in contrast to normal Florida highways&#x27; 53-foot limit. Compare to crawler lane above. Since the major cost of trucking is the fixed cost of the same trailer with its driver the cost per ton of operating with truckway size and weight allowances is 35 to 40 percent below the cost of operations on the non-truckways.
* A haul road only has lanes intended for freight traffic, and non-commercial traffic may be prohibited.

Some jurisdictions generally prohibit trucks from faster lanes on motorways, or from the express lanes in an express-local system. Some lanes have restrictions based on vehicle weight, for example to prevent overloading certain parts of a bridge. A small number of jurisdictions have truck-only lanes, intended to increase reliability of freight deliveries. Different lanes can also have different height restrictions, depending on the shape of overpasses.

==Lane width==

The widths of vehicle lanes typically vary from . Lane widths are commonly narrower on low volume roads and wider on higher volume roads. The lane width depends on the assumed maximum vehicle width, with an additional space to allow for lateral motion of the vehicle.

In the United States, the maximum truck width had been in the Code of Federal Regulations of 1956, which exactly matched then standard shipping container width. The maximum truck width was increased in 1976 to to harmonize with the slightly larger metric world standard width. The same applies to standards in Europe, which increased the allowable width of road vehicles to a current maximum of for most trucks, and for refrigerator trucks. These widths do not include side mirrors, but only the vehicle body. The minimum extra space had been and it is currently assumed to be at least on each side. The international standard allows roads with less traffic to add a second or third lower width lane in the same direction for cars – those that have been built exclude trucks from these narrower lanes; however lower width lanes are not a recommended design principle for new roads, as it could be dangerous if traffic becomes heavier in future.

In the United States, the Interstate Highway standards for the Interstate Highway System use a standard lane width, while narrower lanes are used on lower classification roads. In Europe, laws and road widths vary by country; the minimum widths of lanes are generally between . The federal Bundesstraße interurban network in Germany defines a minimum of for each lane for the smallest two lane roads, with an additional on the outer sides and shoulders being at least on each side. A modern Autobahn divided highway with two lanes per direction has lanes wide with an additional clearance of on each side; with three lanes per direction this becomes for the rightmost lane and for the other lanes. Urban access roads and roads in low-density areas may have lanes as narrow as in width per lane, occasionally with shoulders roughly wide.

=== Extra lane width in horizontal curves ===
Depending on speed, road curvature and vehicle properties, heavy goods vehicle (HGV) combinations are prone to &quot;high speed outside offtracking&quot;. This means that the rearmost axle of the trailer does not follow the lateral path of the truck tractor unit, but may travel significantly—up to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft)—away from the curve center. Hence, narrow lanes on sharp curves have to be designed slightly wider than on straight roads. This effect is much greater on slippery snow-covered roads than on bare asphalt or cement concrete, calling for even larger lane widening.

=== Effects of lane width ===
In urban settings both narrow (less than 2.8 m (9.2 ft)) and wide (over 3.1~3.2 m (10.2-10.5 ft)) lanes increase crash risks. Wider lanes (over 3.3~3.4m (10.8-11.2 ft)) are associated with 33% higher impact speeds, as well as higher crash rates.

Carrying capacity is also maximal at a width of , both for motor traffic and for bicycles. Pedestrian volume declines as lanes widen, and intersections with narrower lanes provide the highest capacity for bicycles. As lane width decreases, traffic speed diminishes.

Narrow lanes cost less to build and maintain. They lessen the time needed to walk across, and reduce stormwater runoff.

==Lane markings==

Painted lane markings, which designate a single line of vehicles for movement within traffic, vary widely from country to country. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Norway, yellow lines separate traffic going in opposite directions and white separates lanes of traffic traveling in the same direction; but that is not the case in many European countries.

Lane markings are mostly lines painted on the road by a road marking machine, which can adjust the marking widths according to the lane type.

==Lane numbering==

Traffic reports in California often refer to accidents being &quot;in the number X lane.&quot; The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) assigns the numbers from left to right. The far left passing lane is the number 1 lane. The number of the slow lane (closest to freeway onramps/offramps) depends on the total number of lanes, and could be anywhere from 2 to 8.

However in the UK, &quot;lane 1&quot; is the &quot;slow lane&quot; (left-hand lane).

== Capacity ==
Lane capacity varies widely due to conditions such as neighboring lanes, lane width, elements next to the road, number of driveways, presence of parking, speed limits, number of heavy vehicles and so on – the range can be as low as 1000 passenger cars / hour to as high as 4800 passenger cars / hour but mostly falls between 1500 and 2400 passenger cars / hour.

<doc id="695978" wikidata="Q747735" url="?curid=695978" title="Paranoid personality disorder">
<text>Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental disorder characterized by paranoia, and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others. People with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily insulted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. They are eager observers and they often think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other interpretations or evidence.

They tend to be guarded and suspicious and have quite constricted emotional lives. Their reduced capacity for meaningful emotional involvement and the general pattern of isolated withdrawal often lend a quality of schizoid isolation to their life experience. People with PPD may have a tendency to bear grudges, suspiciousness, tendency to interpret others&#x27; actions as hostile, persistent tendency to self-reference, or a tenacious sense of personal right. Patients with this disorder can also have significant comorbidity with other personality disorders, such as schizotypal, schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant, and borderline.

==Causes==
A genetic contribution to paranoid traits and a possible genetic link between this personality disorder and schizophrenia exist. A large long-term Norwegian twin study found paranoid personality disorder to be modestly heritable and to share a portion of its genetic and environmental risk factors with the other cluster A personality disorders, schizoid and schizotypal.

Psychosocial theories implicate projection of negative internal feelings and parental modeling. Cognitive theorists believe the disorder to be a result of an underlying belief that other people are unfriendly in combination with a lack of self-awareness.

==Diagnosis==
=== ICD-10 ===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-10 lists &quot;paranoid personality disorder&quot; under &quot;().&quot; It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria. It is also pointed out that for different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and other obligations.

PPD is characterized by at least three of the following symptoms:
# excessive sensitivity to setbacks and rebuffs;
# tendency to bear grudges persistently (i.e. refusal to forgive insults and injuries or slights);
# suspiciousness and a pervasive tendency to distort experience by misconstruing the neutral or friendly actions of others as hostile or contemptuous;
# a combative and tenacious sense of self-righteousness out of keeping with the actual situation;
# recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding sexual fidelity of spouse or sexual partner;
# tendency to experience excessive self-aggrandizing, manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude;
# preoccupation with unsubstantiated &quot;conspiratorial&quot; explanations of events both immediate to the patient and in the world at large.
Includes: expansive paranoid, fanatic, querulant and sensitive paranoid personality disorder.

Excludes: delusional disorder and schizophrenia.

===DSM-5===
The American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM-5 has similar criteria for &quot;paranoid personality disorder&quot;. They require in general the presence of lasting distrust and suspicion of others, interpreting their motives as malevolent, from an early adult age, occurring in a range of situations. Four of seven specific issues must be present, which include different types of suspicions or doubt (such as of being exploited, or that remarks have a subtle threatening meaning), in some cases regarding others in general or specifically friends or partners, and in some cases referring to a response of holding grudges or reacting angrily.

PPD is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. To qualify for a diagnosis, the patient must meet at least four out of the following criteria:
# Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them.
# Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates.
# Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them.
# Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events.
# Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).
# Perceives attacks on their character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack.
# Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual partner.
The DSM-5 lists paranoid personality disorder essentially unchanged from the DSM-IV-TR version and lists associated features that describe it in a more quotidian way. These features include suspiciousness, intimacy avoidance, hostility and unusual beliefs/experiences.

===Millon&#x27;s subtypes===
Various researchers and clinicians may propose varieties and subsets or dimensions of personality related to the official diagnoses. Psychologist Theodore Millon has proposed five subtypes of paranoid personality:

===Differential diagnosis===
The paranoid may be at greater than average risk of experiencing major depressive disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance-related disorders. Criteria for other personality disorder diagnoses are commonly also met, such as: schizoid, schizotypal, narcissistic, avoidant, borderline and negativistic personality disorder.

==Treatment==
Partly as a result of tendencies to mistrust others, there have been few studies conducted over the treatment of paranoid personality disorder. Currently, there are no medicines FDA approved in treating PPD, but antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers may be prescribed under wrong assumptions to treat some of the symptoms. Another form of treatment of PPD is psychoanalysis, normally used in cases where both PPD and BPD are present. However, no published studies directly state the effectiveness of this form of treatment on specifically PPD, as opposed to its effects on BPD. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) has also been suggested as a possible treatment to paranoid personality disorder, but while case studies have shown improvement in the symptoms of the disorder, no systematic/widespread data has been collected to support this. Treatments for PPD can be challenging, as individuals with PPD are reluctant in finding help and have difficulty trusting others.

==Epidemiology==
PPD occurs in about 0.5–4.4% of the general population. It is seen in 2–10% of psychiatric outpatients. In clinical samples men have higher rates, whereas epidemiologically there is a reported higher rate of women.

==History==

Paranoid personality disorder is listed in DSM-V and was included in all previous versions of the DSM. One of the earliest descriptions of the paranoid personality comes from the French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan who described a &quot;fragile personality&quot; that showed idiosyncratic thinking, hypochondriasis, undue sensitivity, referential thinking, and suspiciousness.

Closely related to this description is Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s description from 1905 of a pseudo-querulous personality who is &quot;always on the alert to find grievance, but without delusions&quot;, vain, self-absorbed, sensitive, irritable, litigious, obstinate, and living at strife with the world. In 1921, he renamed the condition paranoid personality and described these people as distrustful, feeling unjustly treated and feeling subjected to hostility, interference and oppression. He also observed a contradiction in these personalities: on the one hand, they stubbornly hold on to their unusual ideas, on the other hand, they often accept every piece of gossip as the truth. Kraepelin also noted that paranoid personalities were often present in people who later developed paranoid psychosis. Subsequent writers also considered traits like suspiciousness and hostility to predispose people to developing delusional illnesses, particularly &quot;late paraphrenias&quot; of old age.

Following Kraepelin, Eugen Bleuler described &quot;contentious psychopathy&quot; or &quot;paranoid constitution&quot; as displaying the characteristic triad of suspiciousness, grandiosity, and feelings of persecution. He also emphasized that these people&#x27;s false assumptions do not attain the form of real delusion.

Ernst Kretschmer emphasized the sensitive inner core of the paranoia-prone personality: they feel shy and inadequate but at the same time they have an attitude of entitlement. They attribute their failures to the machinations of others but secretly to their own inadequacy. They experience constant tension between feelings of self-importance and experiencing the environment as unappreciative and humiliating.

Karl Jaspers, a German phenomenologist, described &quot;self-insecure&quot; personalities who resemble the paranoid personality. According to Jaspers, such people experience inner humiliation, brought about by outside experiences and their interpretations of them. They have an urge to get external confirmation to their self-deprecation and that makes them see insults in the behavior of other people. They suffer from every slight because they seek the real reason for them in themselves. This kind of insecurity leads to overcompensation: compulsive formality, strict social observances, and exaggerated displays of assurance.

In 1950, Kurt Schneider described the &quot;fanatic psychopaths&quot; and divided them into two categories: the combative type that is very insistent about his false notions and actively quarrelsome, and the eccentric type that is passive, secretive, vulnerable to esoteric sects, but nonetheless suspicious about others.

The descriptions of Leonhard and Sheperd from the sixties describe paranoid people as overvaluing their abilities and attributing their failure to the ill-will of others; they also mention that their interpersonal relations are disturbed and they are in constant conflict with others.

In 1975, Polatin described the paranoid personality as rigid, suspicious, watchful, self-centered and selfish, inwardly hypersensitive, but emotionally undemonstrative. However, when there is a difference of opinion, the underlying mistrust, authoritarianism, and rage burst through.

In the 1980s, paranoid personality disorder received little attention, and when it did receive it, the focus was on its 
potential relationship to paranoid schizophrenia. The most significant contribution of this decade comes from Theodore Millon who divided the features of paranoid personality disorder to four categories:

1) Behavioral characteristics of vigilance, abrasive irritability, and counterattack

2) Complaints indicating oversensitivity, social isolation, and mistrust

3) The dynamics of denying personal insecurities, attributing these to others, and self-inflation through grandiose fantasies

4) Coping style of detesting dependence and hostile distancing of oneself from others

== Controversy ==
Due to repeated concerns of the validity of PPD and poor empirical evidence, it has been suggested that PPD be removed from the DSM. This is believed to contribute to low research output on PPD.

<text>MemTest86 and Memtest86+ are memory test software programs designed to test and stress test an x86 architecture computer&#x27;s random-access memory (RAM) for errors, by writing test patterns to most memory addresses, reading back the data, and comparing for errors. Each tries to verify that the RAM will accept and correctly retain arbitrary patterns of data written to it, that there are no errors where different bits of memory interact, and that there are no conflicts between memory addresses.

==MemTest86==

===History===
MemTest86 was developed by Chris Brady in 1994. It was written in C and x86 assembly, and for all BIOS versions, was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The bootloading code was originally derived from Linux 1.2.1. The program is compiled as position-independent code so as to be able to move itself around and test all the memory regions. The proprietary PassMark version does not have this ability.

====BadRAM patch====
Starting from MemTest86 2.3, the program can output a list of bad RAM regions in the format expected by the BadRAM patch for the Linux kernel. GRUB2 is able to supply this same information to an unpatched kernel, making the BadRAM patch unnecessary. Microsoft Windows has a similar feature (badmemorylist/badmemoryaccess), but manual conversion is required for setting it up.

====PassMark purchase====
In February 2013, the original MemTest86 was sold to PassMark. The BIOS version was updated under GPL until version 4.3.7.

MemTest86 Version 5.0 (3 December 2013) was rewritten for UEFI booting (initially with fallback to BIOS booting on non-UEFI systems), allowing for secure boot approval and mouse support. All UEFI versions are released under a proprietary freeware license. Version 6.0 (13 Feb 2015) adds support for DDR4 RAM, and a row-hammer test based on research from Yoongu Kim, &quot;et al.&quot;. Version 8.0 removed backward compatibility with non-UEFI systems, requiring a separate download of the older version 4.3.7.

==Memtest86+==

===History===
After MemTest86 remained at version 3.0 (2002 release) for two years, Samuel Demeulemeester created the Memtest86+ fork to add support for newer CPUs and chipsets.

From version 1.60, the program can output a list of bad RAM regions in the format expected by the BadRAM patch for the Linux kernel (similar to MemTest86 2.3).

The BIOS-based line of Memtest86+ entered a stall after the release of version 5.01 (September 2013). In April 2020, the final BIOS-based version, 5.31 beta, was released with a short changelog claiming &quot;many fixes&quot;.

In May 2020, Martin Whitaker forked Memtest86+ 5.31 into PCMemTest, rewriting it for UEFI support, DDR4 and DDR5 RAM, and supporting all current AMD and Intel chipsets and CPUs. In October 2022, this branch merged back, becoming Memtest86+ 6.0.

===Adoption===
Memtest86+ is included, optionally or by default, in many Linux distributions, including Debian, the derived Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. Ubuntu includes it as part of the default installation if the machine is booting in BIOS mode, showing it in the GRUB OS-select menu; the version 6.0, UEFI-capable, is available from Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar Lobster. Whilst Memtest86+ version 5.01 required significant patching by distributions to keep the 2013 code base functional, the 6.0 release did not require such extensive patching.

==Common features==
There are two development streams of MemTest86(+). The original is simply known as MemTest86. The other, known as Memtest86+, is a development fork of the original MemTest86. Their on-screen appearance and functionality were almost identical until MemTest86 4.3 and Memtest86+ 5.0.

Version 5.0 of MemTest86 added a mouse-driven graphical user interface (GUI) and UEFI support; the latter was added by Memtest86+ from version 6.0.

These programs work with nearly all PC-compatible computers from 80386- and 80486-based systems to the latest systems with 64-bit processors. Each new release adds support for newer processors and chipsets.

MemTest86(+) is designed to run as a stand-alone, self-contained program from a bootable USB flash drive, CD-ROM, floppy disk, or from a suitable boot manager without an operating system present. This is because the program must directly control the hardware being tested and leave as much of the RAM space as possible for examination.

MemTest86(+)&#x27;s testing is very comprehensive, so it can find otherwise hidden problems on machines that appear to work normally. With many chipsets, MemTest86 allows counting of failures even in error-correcting ECC DRAM (without special handling, error correcting memory circuits can mask problems with the underlying memory chips).

Some errors manifest intermittently or depend on the precise bits being stored, and do not occur on each pass; such errors may be revealed by running many passes over an extended period. Some tests use different data each pass to reveal data-dependent errors.

Both versions now support current multi-core processors, the corresponding chipsets, and UEFI.

<doc id="695993" wikidata="Q1916382" url="?curid=695993" title="Media conglomerate">
<text>A media conglomerate, media company, media group, or media institution is a company that owns numerous companies involved in mass media enterprises, such as music, television, radio, publishing, motion pictures, video games, amusement park, or the Internet. The weekly magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; commented, &quot;Media conglomerates strive for policies that facilitate their control of the markets around the world.&quot;

==Terminology==
A conglomerate is a large company composed of a number of companies (subsidiaries) engaged in generally unrelated businesses.

Some media conglomerates use their access in multiple areas to share various kinds of content such as: news, video and music, between users. The media sector&#x27;s tendency to consolidate has caused formerly diversified companies to appear less diverse to prospective investors in comparison with similar companies that are traded publicly and privately. Therefore, the term media group may also be applied, however, it has not yet replaced the more traditional term.

== Criticism ==
Critics have accused the large media conglomerates of dominating the media and using unfair practices. During a protest in November 2007, critics such as Jesse Jackson spoke out against consolidation of the media. This can be seen in the news industry, where corporations refuse to publicize information that would be harmful to their interests. Because some corporations do not publish any material that criticizes them or their interests, media conglomerates have been criticized for limiting free speech or not protecting free speech. These practices are also suspected of contributing to the merging of entertainment and news (sensationalism) at the expense of the coverage of serious issues. They are also accused of being a leading force behind the standardization of culture (see globalization, Americanization) and are frequently criticized by groups that perceive news organizations as being biased toward special interests of the owners.

Because there are fewer independent media, there is less diversity in news and entertainment and therefore less competition. This can result in the reduction of different points of view as well as vocalization about different issues. There is also a lack of ethnic and gender diversity as a majority of those in media are white, middle-class men. There is a concern that their views are being shared disproportionately more than other groups, such as women and ethnic minorities. Women and minorities also have less ownership of media. Women have less than 7 percent of TV and radio licenses, and minorities have around 7 percent of radio licenses and 3 percent of TV licenses.

==Examples by country==

In the 2024 Forbes Global 2000 list, Comcast is the world&#x27;s largest media conglomerate, in terms of revenue, with The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Discovery, &amp; Paramount Global completing the top four.

In 1984, fifty independent media companies owned the majority of media interests within the United States. By 2011, 90% of the United States&#x27;s media was controlled by six media conglomerates: GE/Comcast (NBC, Universal), News Corp (Fox News, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;New York Post&quot;), Disney (ABC, ESPN, Pixar), Viacom (MTV, BET, Paramount Pictures), Time Warner (CNN, HBO, Warner Bros.), and CBS (Showtime, NFL.com).

Between 1941 and 1975, several laws that restricted channel ownership within radio and television were enacted in order to maintain unbiased and diverse media. However under the Reagan administration, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission, then led by FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler, began a concerted deregulation over the years 1981 and 1985. The number of television stations a single entity can own increased from seven to 12 stations.

The industry continued to deregulate with enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Signed by President Bill Clinton on 8 February 1996, it was considered by the FCC to be the &quot;first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years&quot;. In the radio industry, the 40-station ownership cap was lifted, leading to an unprecedented amount of consolidation. Since this period, IHeartMedia grew from 40 stations to 1200 stations, in all 50 states, while Viacom grew to owning 180 stations across 41 markets.

As media consolidation grew, some in the nation began to speculate how it might negatively impact society at large. In the case of Minot, North Dakota, the concerns regarding media consolidation is realized. On 18 January 2002, a train containing hazardous chemicals derailed in the middle of the night, exposing countless Minot residents to toxic waste. Upon trying to get out an emergency broadcast, the Minot police were unable to reach anyone. They were instead forwarded to the same automated message, as all the broadcast stations in Minot were single-handedly owned by IHeartMedia. As the FCC reviews media ownership rules, broadcasters continued to petition it for the elimination of all rules, while those who are against this easing would often cite the incident in Minot as how consolidation could be harmful.

Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and New Zealand also experience the concentration of multiple media enterprises in a few companies. This concentration is an ongoing concern for the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission, and New Zealand&#x27;s Broadcasting Standards Authority. Other countries that have large media conglomerates with impacts on the world include: Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, China, Mexico and Brazil. Media conglomerates outside of the United States include Fujisankei Communications Group (Fuji Television), Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, Hubert Burda Media, ITV, ProSiebenSat.1, Mediaset, Axel Springer, JCDecaux, China Central Television, Alibaba Group, ABS-CBN Corporation, GMA Network, MediaQuest Holdings, Radio Philippines Network, Aliw Broadcasting Corporation, Advanced Media Broadcasting System, People&#x27;s Television Network, Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, Presidential Broadcast Service, Viva Communications, Prasar Bharati, The Asahi Shimbun, Grupo Televisa, TV Azteca, Grupo Imagen, Grupo Globo, Baidu, GMM Grammy and Bertelsmann.

<text>Madaraka Day (&quot;Internal self rule&quot; or &quot;Self-Governance&quot; Day) is a national holiday that is celebrated every 1 June in every year in the Republic of Kenya. It commemorates the day in 1963 that Kenya attained internal self rule after being a British colony since 1920. Kenya only attained partial independence on this day in 1961 and did not become a fully established republic until about three and a half years later, on 12 December 1964. In recognition of that, Kenya also celebrates Jamhuri Day (Republic Day) on 12 December every year.

Madaraka is a Swahili word for &quot;authority,&quot; &quot;the assignment of authority&quot;.

<text>Bodyjar are an Australian pop punk band which formed in 1990. They began performing under the name Bodyjar in 1994; their previous names included Damnation (1990–91) and Helium (1992–93). The latter group released an album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hold Me Down&quot;, in October 1992. As Bodyjar their original line-up were Cameron Baines on vocals and guitar; Ben Petterson on vocals and guitar; Grant Relf on vocals and bass guitar; and Charles Zerafa on drums. In 1995 Ross Hetherington (ex-Bastard Squad, Swamp Rats) replaced Zerafa on drums. In 1999 Tom Read replaced Petterson on guitar and in 2004 Hetherington made way for Shane Wakker on drums.

Bodyjar released six studio albums, &quot;Take a Look Inside&quot; (1994), &quot;Rimshot!&quot; (1996), &quot;No Touch Red&quot; (1998), &quot;How It Works&quot; (2000), &quot;Plastic Skies&quot; (2002) and &quot;Bodyjar&quot; (2005), before disbanding in September 2009. After a hiatus they reformed in March 2012, their next album, &quot;Role Model&quot;, appeared on 18 October 2013, together with corresponding tour dates.

==History==
===1990–1993: Damnation and Helium===
In 1990 future members of Bodyjar formed a rock group, Damnation, in Melbourne with Cameron Baines on guitar, Ben Petterson on guitar, Grant Relf on bass guitar and Charles Zerafa on drums. Baines, Petterson and Relf had grown up in the same Melbourne suburb of Vermont and attended the same primary schools. Damnation recorded two demos, &quot;Demo&quot; and &quot;Grow&quot;, before changing their name to Helium in 1992, as a pop punk group. That group issued a demo, &quot;Bodyjar&quot;, in 1992 and followed with an album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hold Me Down&quot;, on Shagpile Records in October that year. It was co-produced by the band with Phil Rose (of Nursery Crimes) at Argenteuil Studios, Richmond. By 1994 Helium changed their name again, to Bodyjar, as a punk rock band.

===1994: Debut studio album, &quot;Take a Look Inside&quot;===
Bodyjar line-up of Baines, Petterson, Relf and Zerafa recorded their studio album, &quot;Take a Look Inside&quot;, at Sing Sing Studios, Melbourne. It was co-produced by Bill Stevenson and Stephen Egerton (both from touring United States band, All) in March 1994. In August 1994 they had their first gig, as Bodyjar, at the Great Britain Hotel, Richmond. A five-track extended play, &quot;Time to Grow Up&quot;, was issued in that same month. &quot;Take a Look Inside&quot; was released in September on Shagpile Records and distributed by Shock Records. According to Howlspace website&#x27;s Ed Nimmervoll &quot;With the help of punk fanzines and all-ages gigs at pubs Bodyjar managed to build a formidable reputation despite grunge&quot;. Also in 1994, they supported NOFX at the Prince of Wales in St. Kilda, with Wally Meanie&#x27;s side project Even, and One Inch Punch (later Mid-Youth Crisis).

===1995–1997: &quot;Rimshot!&quot; and &quot;No Touch Red&quot;===
Charles Zerafa was replaced in 1995 by Ross Hetherington on drums – a former member of &quot;hardcore punk outfits&quot;, Bastard Squad and Swamp Rats. The group co-headlined a national tour with Pennywise and Blink-182 in December. The band supported No Fun at All and Face to Face on tours of Japan (October 1995), Canada, Europe (March 1996) and then United States (April 1997). On their European and US tours they promoted their next album, &quot;Rimshot!&quot; (February 1996). It had been recorded in September 1995: the group co-produced with Kaj Dahlstrom (The Bo-Weevils, Nursery Crimes); with a US release on 3 September 1996.

Bodyjar&#x27;s third album, &quot;No Touch Red&quot;, was recorded the following year in Montreal over 12 days.

===1998–2002 &quot;How it Works&quot; and &quot;Plastic Skies&quot;===
Petterson left the band following the 1999 Big Day Out festival. Facing an impending breakup, the band added Read, formerly of 180 Discord, to the lineup. That year Bodyjar signed with EMI/Capitol, having completed a 33-song demo for their upcoming release. Though independent for the majority of their career, Bodyjar released two studio albums for EMI/Capitol in the early 2000s. The first album for the major label, &quot;How It Works&quot;, produced by Kalju Tonuma, reached the top 20 on the Australian ARIAnet albums chart in 2000 and achieved gold sales (35,000 copies). The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Not the Same&quot;, was also featured in a Pepsi ad campaign and the video games &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; and &quot;MX Superfly&quot;.

After their second major label album, &quot;Plastic Skies&quot;, and the retrospective, &quot;Jarchives&quot;, featuring new and rare material, failed to build on the success of &quot;How It Works&quot;, Bodyjar returned to their former label, Shock Records.

===2003–2009: Self-titled album and disbandment ===
They released a self-titled album in 2005 after Hetherington left the band in May 2004 while on tour with The Offspring. Hetherington was temporarily replaced for the remainder of the tour by Gordy Forman of Australian punk band Frenzal Rhomb. The role was then filled by Wakker, formerly of the band Channel 3, and he was named the group&#x27;s permanent drummer later that year.

Despite having their commercial peak seemingly behind them, Bodyjar remained a major attraction on the all-ages circuit in Australia, and continued to tour and play festivals. Selections from their discography have also been repackaged and released for the American and Japanese markets, where they have consolidated live followings.

On 10 January 2008, the band said a new album &quot;looks to be shaping up for late in the year&quot;. However, the band announced on 4 September 2009, they would be calling it quits after a farewell tour, which took place between October and December 2009. The band reformed for a one-off gig in April 2011 to celebrate the Royal Artillery Hotel (The Arthouse) venue&#x27;s last drinks calendar.

===2012: reformation ===
Bodyjar reunited in March 2012 to perform &quot;No Touch Red&quot; in its entirety at Melbourne&#x27;s Corner Hotel, together with former tour mates One Dollar Short, Antiskeptic and Game Over. Regarding the show, bassist Relf remarked, &quot;When a good friend of Bodyjar&#x27;s says they want to start a label and release one of your old albums on vinyl, you don&#x27;t have to think too long or too hard about the response. &quot;No Touch Red&quot; kicked some arse back in the day and still holds its head up high all these years later, so I say let there be vinyl and a show to boot.&quot;

===2013–2016: &quot;Role Model&quot;===
As of February 2013, Bodyjar has performed as a support act for various touring bands in Australia, such as The Descendents. Read explained in an October 2013 interview that, following the Descendents tour, the band had &quot;a little bit of money in the bank&quot; and decided to write and record for a new album: &quot;we just thought let&#x27;s write some songs and if they are good enough we can record them and if they&#x27;re not then we can spend the money on beer I guess. But they turned out really well.&quot;

Satisfied with their new songs, the band announced the release of a new record, &quot;Role Model&quot;, which is the first collection of new material in eight years. The first single, &quot;Fairytales&quot;, premiered on 12 September 2013. Prior to the release of &quot;Role Model&quot;, Read explained the motivation that underpinned the album:
... we had just finished the &quot;No Touch Red&quot; tour and I had a conversation with Grant about writing a fast kind of album like that, doing what we are good at and stop fucking around with slower songs and big rock riffs. Just do what comes natural and write for ourselves again. There is a lot of emphasis on having fun this time around, I think that has come through on the record. &quot;Stop enjoying yourself and have some fun&quot;.

Read also explained that Tom Larkin of New Zealand band Shihad produced the album at his own studios in Brunswick, Melbourne, Australia, and that the band referenced the sound production of the bands Refused, Foo Fighters and Starmarket for the recording process. Joey Cape, of Lagwagon, and Ahren Stringer, of The Amity Affliction, contributed vocals to the album, while a guitar solo was recorded by Stephen Egerton of Descendents.

Bodyjar enlisted Australian independent music label UNFD to release &quot;Role Model&quot; on 18 October 2013, and bundle packages that included a skateboard deck, a T-shirt and a stubby holder were released. Baines hired Dutch design company ATTAK to create the artwork for the album.

===2017–present: &quot;Terra Firma&quot; and &quot;New Rituals&quot;===
On 13 October 2017 the band released a new EP, &quot;Terra Firma&quot; on three vinyl colour-ways limited to 100 copies each.

Bodyjar were one of the first bands to return to live shows following Melbourne&#x27;s COVID lockdown period. The band returned in January 2021 with a show at 170 Russell.

On 1 December 2021, Bodyjar announced their eighth studio album &quot;New Rituals&quot;, released on 4 February 2022; 9 years after their previous studio album &quot;Role Model&quot;. Recording of &quot;New Rituals&quot; took place throughout 2020 and 2021, a process which was heavily delayed by Melbourne&#x27;s numerous COVID lockdowns.

==Side projects==

At the beginning of 2007, Baines and Wakker launched a side project called Cola Wars, a moniker that Baines has used for various projects since 1999—Mark Brunott (Automan, The Volume10, and Steelbirds) and Mikey Juler (ex-For Amusement Only) completed the lineup. The band have played under other pseudonyms, such as &quot;Daughters of the Rich&quot; and &quot;William Shatner&#x27;s Dacks&quot;.

Read&#x27;s and Relf&#x27;s side project is called Burn The City, which also involves a former member of Australian band One Dollar Short on drums.

==Personal lives==

Shane Wakker is from the Victorian town of Moe. Cameron Baines&#x27;s wedding to wife Regan occurred in late April 2012.
Since 2016, Baines has operated Locality Store in Greensborough, which sells skateboards and equipment, music, and apparel.

<text>Prada S.p.A. (, ; ) is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in 1913 in Milan by Mario Prada. It specializes in leather handbags, travel accessories, shoes, ready-to-wear, and other fashion accessories. Prada licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear and L’Oréal for fragrances and cosmetics.

Founded in 1913 and named for the family of founder Mario Prada, the company originally sold imported English animal goods before transitioning to waterproof nylon fabrics in the 1970s under the leadership of Mario&#x27;s granddaughter, Miuccia Prada and her husband Patrizio Bertelli. By the 1990s, Prada was perceived as a luxury brand, a designation credited to originality in its designs. To further the business, Miuccia Prada founded Miu Miu as a subsidiary of Prada around this time period; the company additionally partnered with LVMH to acquire a joint stake in Fendi; Prada further assisted LVMH in its failed takeover of Gucci.

The brand struggled through the late 2000s and early to mid 2010s, which included a failed initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, though began a resurgence in popularity entering into the 2020s. Miuccia Prada and Bertelli, both entering old age, began a transition in leadership to their children in the 2020s, bringing in former Luxottica CEO Andrea Guerra to lead the company for the years during the transition. The house presently sees annual revenue in the billions of Euros, making €4.2 billion in 2022 with profit that same year totaling to €776 million; furthermore, Prada and less so Miu Miu are seen as having very high desirability among consumers across various reports.

==History==

===Founding===

The company started in 1913 by Mario Prada and his brother Martino as &quot;Fratelli Prada&quot;, a leather goods shop in Milan. Initially, the shop sold animal goods, imported English steamer trunks, handbags. Alongside these handcrafted leather goods, Prada also sold travel accessories, as well as beauty cases, jewelry, luxury items, and rare objects. 

Mario Prada opens an exclusive store in Milan’s prestigious Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II that sells leather bags, trunks, beauty cases, jewels, luxury accessories, and rare objects.

Mario Prada did not believe women should have a role in business, so he prevented female family members from entering his company. Ironically, Mario&#x27;s son had no interest in the business, so it was Mario&#x27;s daughter Luisa who succeeded Mario and ran Prada for almost twenty years. Luisa&#x27;s daughter, Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970, eventually taking over from Luisa in 1978.

Miuccia began making waterproof backpacks out of &quot;Pocono&quot;, a nylon fabric. She met Patrizio Bertelli in 1977, an Italian who had begun his own leather goods business at the age of 24, and he joined the company soon after. He advised Miuccia on company business, which she followed. It was his advice to discontinue importing English goods and to change the existing luggage.

===Development===
Miuccia inherited the company in 1978 by which time sales were up to U.S. $450,000. With Bertelli alongside her as business manager, Miuccia was allowed time to implement her creativity in the company&#x27;s designs. She would go on to incorporate her ideas into the house of Prada that would change it.
She released her first set of backpacks and totes in 1979. They were made out of a tough military spec black nylon that her grandfather had used as coverings for steamer trunks. Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising and high prices, but the lines would go on to become her first commercial hit.
Next, Miuccia and Bertelli sought out wholesale accounts for the bags in upscale department stores and boutiques worldwide. In 1983, Prada opened a second boutique in the centre of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan&#x27;s shopping heart, on the site of the previous historic &quot;London House&quot; emporium run by Felice Bellini from 1870 to the 1960s, reminiscent of the original shop, but with a sleek and modern contrast to it.
The next big release was a nylon tote. That same year, the house of Prada began expansion across continental Europe and the United States by opening locations in prominent shopping districts within Florence, Paris, Madrid, and New York City. A shoe line was also released in 1984. In 1985 Miuccia released the &quot;classic Prada handbag&quot; that became an overnight sensation. Although practical and sturdy, its sleek lines and craftsmanship had a luxury that has become the Prada signature.

In 1987, Miuccia and Bertelli married. Prada launched its women&#x27;s ready-to-wear collection in 1988, and the designs came to be known for their dropped waistlines and narrow belts. Prada&#x27;s popularity increased when the fashion world took notice of its clean lines, opulent fabrics, and basic colors.

The logo for the label was not as obvious a design element as those on bags from other prominent luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. It tried to market its lack of prestigious appeal, including of its apparel, by projecting an image of &quot;anti-status&quot; or &quot;inverse snobbery&quot;.

===1990s===

Prada&#x27;s originality made it one of the most influential fashion houses, and the brand became a premium status symbol in the 1990s.

Sales were reported at L 70 billion, or US$31.7 million, in 1998. Patrizio di Marco took charge of the growing business in the United States after working for the house in Asia. He was successful in having the Prada bags prominently displayed in department stores, so that they could become a hit with fashion editors. Prada&#x27;s continued success was attributed to its &quot;working-class&quot; theme which, Ginia Bellafante at &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; proclaimed, &quot;was becoming chic in the high-tech, IPO-driven early 1990s.&quot; Furthermore, now husband and wife, Miuccia and Bertelli led the Prada label on a cautious expansion, making products hard to come by.

In 1992, the high fashion brand Miu Miu, named after Miuccia&#x27;s nickname, launched. Miu Miu catered to younger consumers and celebrities. By 1993 Prada was awarded the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for accessories.
The first ready-to-wear menswear collection was Spring/Summer 1998. By 1994, sales were at US$210 million, with clothing sales accounting for 20% (expected to double in 1995). Prada won another award from the CFDA, in 1995 as a &quot;designer of the year&quot; 1996 witnessed the opening of the 18,000 ft² Prada boutique in Manhattan, New York, the largest in the chain at the time. By now the House of Prada operated in 40 locations worldwide, 20 of which were in Japan. The company owned eight factories and subcontracted work from 84 other manufacturers in Italy. Prada&#x27;s and Bertelli&#x27;s respective businesses were merged to create Prapar B.V. in 1996. The name, however, was later changed to Prada B.V., and Patrizio Bertelli was named Chief Executive Officer of the Prada luxury company.

1996 can also be seen as marking an important turning point in Prada&#x27;s aesthetics, one that fueled the brand&#x27;s worldwide reputation. Journalists praised Miuccia&#x27;s development of an “ugly chic” style, which initially confused customers by offering blatantly unsexy outfits which then revealed to offer daring and original takes on the relationship between fashion and desire. Since then Prada has been regarded as one of the most intelligent and conceptual designers.

In 1997, Prada posted revenue of US$674 million. Another store in Milan opened that same year. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Bertelli smashed the windows of the store a day before the opening, after he had become deeply unsatisfied with the set-up. Bertelli also acquired shares in the Gucci group, and later blamed Gucci for &quot;aping his wife&#x27;s designs.&quot; In June 1998, Bertelli gained 9.5% return on investment at US$260 million. Analysts began to speculate that he was attempting a take over of the Gucci group. The proposition seemed unlikely, however, because Prada was at the time still a small company and was in debt. &quot;Funding Universe&quot; states that &quot;At the very least, Prada had a voice as one of Gucci&#x27;s largest shareholders (a 10 percent holding would be required for the right to request a seat on the board) and would stand to profit tidily should anyone try to take over Gucci.&quot; However, Bertelli sold his shares to Moët-Hennessy • Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault in January 1998 for a profit of US$140 million. Arnault was in fact attempting a take over of Gucci. LVMH had been purchasing fashion companies for a while and already owned Dior, Givenchy, and other luxury brands. Gucci, however, managed to fend him off by selling a 45% stake to industrialist François Pinault, for US$3 billion. In 1998, the first Prada menswear boutique opened in Los Angeles.

Prada was determined to hold a leading portfolio of luxury brands, like the Gucci group and LVMH. Prada purchased 51% of Helmut Lang&#x27;s company based in New York for US$40 million in March 1999. Lang&#x27;s company was worth about US$100 million. Months later, Prada paid US$105 million to have full control of Jil Sander A.G., a German-based company with annual revenue of US$100 million. The purchase gained Prada a foothold in Germany, and months later Jil Sander resigned as chairwoman of her namesake company. Church &amp; Company, an English shoemaker, also came under the control of Prada, when Prada bought 83% of the company for US$170 million. A joint venture between Prada and the De Rigo group was also formed that year to produce Prada eyewear. In October 1999, Prada joined with LVMH and beat Gucci to buy a 51% stake in the Rome-based Fendi S.p.A. Prada&#x27;s share of the purchase (25.5%) was worth US$241.5 million out of the reported US$520 million total paid by both Prada and LVMH. Prada took on debts of Fendi, as the latter company was not doing well financially.

These acquisitions elevated Prada to the top of the luxury goods market in Europe. Revenue tripled from that of 1996, to L2 trillion. Despite apparent success, the company was still in debt.

===2000s===
The company&#x27;s merger and purchasing sprees slowed in the 2000s. However, the company signed a loose agreement with Azzedine Alaia. Skincare products in unit doses were introduced in the United States, Japan, and Europe in 2000. A 30-day supply of cleansing lotion was marketed at the retail price of US$100. To help pay off debts of over US$850  million, the company planned on listing 30% of the company on the Milan Stock Exchange in June 2001. However, the offering slowed down after a decline in spending on luxury goods in the United States and Japan. In 2001, under the pressure of his bankers, Bertelli sold all of Prada&#x27;s 25.5% share in Fendi to LVMH. The sale raised only US$295 million.

By 2006, the Helmut Lang, Amy Fairclough, Ghee, and Jil Sander labels were sold. Jil Sander was sold to the private equity firm Change Capital Partners, which was headed by Luc Vandevelde, the chairman of Carrefour, while the Helmut Lang label is now owned by Japanese fashion company Link Theory. Prada is still recovering from the Fendi debt. More recently, a 45% stake of the Church &amp; Company brand has been sold to Equinox.

The Prada Spring/Summer 2009 Ready-to-Wear fashion show, held on 23 September 2008 in Milan, got infamous coverage because all the models on the catwalk were tottering – several of them stumbled, while two models fell down in front of the photographers and had to be helped by spectators to get up. They removed their shoes in order to continue their walk. One more model (Sigrid Agren) even had to stop and go back during the finale walk as she couldn&#x27;t manage walking in her high heels any longer. Interviewed right after the show, one model declared: &quot;I was having a panic attack, my hands were shaking. The heels were so high.&quot; The designer Miuccia Prada, on her side, did not blame the height of the shoes, but the silk little socks inside, which were slippery and moved inside of the shoes, preventing the models&#x27; feet from having a correct grip on the sole. Miuccia Prada also assured that the shoes sold in stores would have a lower heel, and that the little socks would be sewn into the shoes in order to prevent further slips. But many fashionistas rightly claimed that the socks, once sewn into the shoes, would be non-washable and would quickly stink and become grey. Consequently, the shoes have never been commercially sold.

=== 2010s ===
According to &quot;Fortune&quot;, Bertelli planned on increasing revenue of the company to US$5 billion by 2010.

On 6 May 2011 Hong Kong Stock Exchange came under fire for approving Prada&#x27;s IPO despite the Prada Gender Discrimination Case. Feminist NGOs and Hong Kong Legislative Council lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan protested in front of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

On 24 June 2011 the brand was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to raise $2.14 billion, but failed to meet expectations reported by AAP on 17 June 2011 and Bloomberg.

In 2015, Prada&#x27;s turnover was 3,551.7 million euros, up 1 percent from 2014, while its gross operating profit fell 16.5 percent to 954.2 million euros.

In July 2016, Prada began selling its clothing online through Net-a-Porter and Mytheresa in response to changing consumer preferences and the need to reach a wider audience. This strategic move allowed Prada to tap into e-commerce expertise, reduce overhead costs, and adapt to the digital age while maintaining its luxury brand image..

As of March 2018, Prada&#x27;s sales turned positive after declining since 2014, and their stock jumped 14% at the news.

Stating that Prada would be &quot;(f)ocusing on innovative materials will allow the company to explore new boundaries of creative design while meeting the demand for ethical products,&quot; the company announced in 2019 that fur will be eliminated from the collection and all house brands as of 2020.

===2020s===
In February 2020, Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli named the Belgian designer Raf Simons as co-creative director.

In August 2020, the fashion house announced it would no longer use kangaroo leather in its products. In 2020, fashion magazine &quot;Vanity Teen&quot; promoted its Prada Resort 21 campaign.

January 2023 saw Prada announce Andrea Guerra as its next CEO; Guerra formerly was CEO of both Luxottica and Eataly, and later the leader of LVMH&#x27;s hotel division. Guerra was onboarded to ease the transition between the Bertelli and his children, who are expected to inherit the company. One of Guerra&#x27;s first moves was to look at dual listing Prada stock on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as well as on a European stock exchange, expected to be one in Milan.

== Prada in popular culture ==

=== Films ===
The 1999 feature film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; features the following exchange extolling the virtues of Prada ownership:
The 2006 feature film &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Lauren Weisberger) earned Meryl Streep an Oscar nomination for her role. Her shoe wardrobe for the film was said to be &quot;at least 40% Prada&quot; by the costume designer Patricia Field. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue and the supposed inspiration for Meryl Streep&#x27;s character, wore Prada to the film&#x27;s premiere.

=== Art ===
In 2005, a false Prada boutique was built as an art installation 26 miles away from Marfa, Texas. Called &quot;Prada Marfa,&quot; the purpose of the structure was to eventually disintegrate into its surroundings. Shoes and bags were provided by Miuccia Prada from the Summer Season 2005 collection. The installation was looted after being completed, and the restoration needed led to a revise in plans, making the structure a permanent installation.

==Philanthropy and sponsoring==
===Arts and architecture===
Inaugurated in 2000, Prada&#x27;s Milan Headquarters are located in a former industrial space between via Bergamo and Via Fogazzaro. An art installation by Carsten Höller that takes the form of a three-story metal slide leads from Miuccia Prada&#x27;s office to the interior courtyard.

Completed in 2002, Prada&#x27;s New York City Headquarters open, located in a former Times Square piano factory renovated by the Herzog &amp; de Meuron architecture firm.

2003 – &quot;Garden-Factories&quot; Project – Prada collaborates with architect Guido Canali to rejuvenate the landscape surrounding their manufacturers.

In 2004, &quot;Waist Down – Skirts by Miuccia Prada&quot; bowed at the Tokyo Epicenter. A traveling exhibition featuring 100 skirts designed by Miuccia Prada and conceived by curator Kayoko Ota of AMO in collaboration with Mrs. Prada, the exhibition went on to Shanghai, New York, Los Angeles and Seoul.

Completed in 2009, Prada commissioned an unusual multi-purpose building from Rem Koolhaas&#x27;s OMA group called the Prada Transformer in Seoul. The building was first used to display the &quot;Waist Down – Skirts by Miuccia Prada&quot; exhibition, and later changed into a movie theater.

In 2012, Mrs. Prada, along with designer Elsa Schiaparelli, was the subject of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s exhibition, &quot;Impossible Conversations&quot;. The Los Angeles Epicenter was also restored in 2012.

In 2014, an exhibition called &quot;Pradasphere&quot; bowed in London&#x27;s Harrods and Hong Kong&#x27;s Central Ferry Pier 4, highlighting the Prada universe.

In 2015, Prada opened a permanent home for Fondazione Prada in Milan. Located in a former distillery redesigned by Rem Koolhaas&#x27;s OMA group, it hosts a permanent collection of site-specific art as well as galleries of rotating exhibits. Intended to act as a gathering space for the local community, it also features a performance space, movie theater, bookstore, and a cafe – Bar Luce, with an interior designed by director Wes Anderson.

In 2016, after 6 years of restoration Prada opened an events space in a historic residence in the Rong Zhai district of Shanghai, China.

===Sports sponsoring===
Patrizio Bertelli&#x27;s passion for sailing led Prada to form Team Luna Rossa in 1997 in order to participate in the America&#x27;s Cup. On 28 September 2017 it was announced by the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron that Prada will be the hosting sponsor of Challenger Selection Series at the 2021 America&#x27;s Cup, superseding the role of Louis Vuitton started in 1983.

The Challenger Selection Series that was the Louis Vuitton Cup, will now be known as the Prada Cup, and the America&#x27;s Cup Match will be presented by Prada. It will be held in Auckland, New Zealand, January 2021.

=== Environmental sustainability ===
The luxury Group, Prada, allied with UNESCO&#x27;s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission in 2019 to introduce an &#x27;educational program&#x27;, SEA BEYOND, about sea-peservation. The rationale behind such an educational project is to sensibilize the youth and make them aware of &#x27;ocean pollution&#x27; and the importance of preserving the sea. At the Sustainable Fashion Awards 2022, the project SEA BEYOND, which simultaneously included &#x27;ocean-literacy&#x27; and &#x27;sustainable fashion&#x27;, received an award. In June 2023, Prada announced its plan to increase its financial support for the Sea Beyond project. Accordingly, for the next two years, the Italian luxury brand will donate 1% of sales revenues from its Re-Nylon collections. This will allow the project to broaden its scope beyond ocean education with two ocean-related fields of action; support for scientific research and community projects. Also in December 2023, Prada unveiled its engagement to the UN’s Global Compact (UNGC) initiative which reflected its commitment to work according guiding principles relating to human rights, the environment, labour and anti-corruption.

In January 2024, Prada announced its new partnership with the international non-profit organization Bibliothèques Sans Frontières involves the creation of a resource space dedicated to the seabed.

=== Prada Female Discrimination Case ===
Prada Female Discrimination Case was the first women&#x27;s rights lawsuit and movement of luxury fashion industry that appeared in the global media in 2010. It was named “David vs. Goliath” by the global NGOs leader. The Prada Female Discrimination Case occurred 4 years after the Me Too movement and was started by activist, Tarana Burke.

On December 10, 2009, Bovrisse filed a lawsuit against Prada Japan accusing them of discriminating against women in the workplace. Prada Luxembourg (where the trademark is registered) countersued for defamation, stating &quot;voicing women&#x27;s rights damaged Prada&#x27;s brand logo.&quot;

In May 2011, the Feminists rallied outside the Tsim She Tsui branch of Prada, calling on the Hong Kong exchange to veto the brand&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO). In May 2012, a Labour Network Monitoring Asian Transnational Corporations issued a letter against LVMH Group on appointing Sebastian Suhl as COO of Givenchy while he was in the case of sexual harassment in Japan and Luxembourg. In October 2012, Tokyo District Court Judge Reiko Morioka ruled in favor of Prada, saying their alleged discrimination was “acceptable for a luxury fashion label.” Bovrisse claimed the court was not fair and accused the judge of screaming at her. Bovrisse took her discrimination claims to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The committee, without mentioning Bovrisse, did issue a report to the Japanese Government urging them to enact regulations that would make sexual harassment in the workplace illegal.

===Labor rights===
Prada is the main buyer from the Turkish leather factory DESA, which was found guilty by the Turkish Supreme Court of illegally dismissing workers who joined a union. The Clean Clothes Campaign, a labor rights organization based in Europe, has called on Prada to ensure that freedom of association is respected at the factory. On 30 January 2013 Clean Clothes Campaign reported, &quot;Trade Union Harassment Continues at Prada Supplier&quot;.

Research of the social democratic party in the European Parliament, the Sheffield Hallam University and further Groups accused Prada in 2023 of using forced labour camps exploiting muslim Uyghurs in china provided by the Anhui Huamao Group Co., Ltd. for production.

===Ostrich leather===
In February 2015, a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Charles Curkin was published about the use of ostrich leather by luxury fashion brands and the brutal methods by which it is removed from the flightless birds. It was based on a months-long investigation conducted by PETA and namechecked Prada as one of fashion&#x27;s key brands dealing in products made from ostrich skin.

===Blackface imagery===
On 14 December 2018 Prada was forced to pull a new range of accessories and displays from its stores following complaints that they featured &quot;blackface imagery.&quot; Prada scrapped the products after outrage spread online when a New Yorker spotted the character at the Prada&#x27;s Soho store and blasted the brand for using &quot;Sambo like imagery&quot; in a viral Facebook post.

Prada stated in a tweet in response, &quot;Prada Group never had the intention of offending anyone and we abhor all forms of racism and racist imagery. In this interest we will withdraw the characters in question from display and circulation.&quot;

In response to the incident, Prada assembled a diversity and inclusion advisory council co-chaired by Ava DuVernay and Theaster Gates.

===Investigation on tax evasion===
, Prada was being investigated by Italian prosecutors for possible tax evasion after the luxury-goods company disclosed undeclared taxable income. Prada SpA Chairman Miuccia Prada, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli and accountant Marco Salomoni have been named in the probe, which is for possible undeclared or false tax claims. The chairwoman of Prada faced an investigation after it was alleged the company avoided nearly £400 million in tax by transferring services abroad.
Italy&#x27;s &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; newspaper said on Friday Prada and Bertelli had paid 420 million euros ($571 million) to Italy&#x27;s tax agency to settle their tax affairs. Despite the settlement, an investigation continued. As of 2016, prosecutors requested the case be dropped as the debt had been settled.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships.

After the 1982 World Snooker Championship, two other tournaments which were open to all members of the WPBSA – the International Open and the Professional Players Tournament – carried ranking points. Points for world championship finishes from 1983 became worth double the previous tariff, with ten points for the winner, eight for the runner up, and so on. In the 1983/1984 snooker season, the Lada Classic was added as a ranking tournament. The UK Championship and Dulux British Open were added to the ranking list from the 1984/1985 season, which meant that performances in those events were taken into account for the 1985/1986 rankings. In the same season, due to changes in sponsors, the Professional Players Tournament became the Rothmans Grand Prix, and the Lada Classic became the Mercantile Credit Classic. The tournaments that counted towards the 1985/1986 rankings were those which were open to all professional players over the preceding three seasons.

Merit points were awarded to players who were required to compete in qualifying rounds of ranking tournaments and reached the last 32, with a full merit point awarded if this was achieved in the world championship, and half a merit point otherwise. No points were awarded to a player who did not win any matches in a given tournament (for example, a top 16 player seeded into the last 32 of the world championship would not win any merit points if they lost their first match).

The journalist Janice Hale commented in March 1985 that as the ranking list was updated only annually, players such as John Spencer who had won only one match in the year since the 1984 World Championship, and Bill Werbeniuk, who had not won any, were at an advantage over other players who had performed better in that time, as the top 16 received direct entry to the last-32 round of the 1985 World Snooker Championship, meaning that their minimum guaranteed prize money was higher.

Steve Davis retained the number one position that he had held in the previous two ranking lists, while Cliff Thorburn moved up from second to third, exchanging places with Tony Knowles. The 1985 World champion Dennis Taylor moved up from 11th to fourth. Of the top 16 players from the previous year, the largest drops were by Eddie Charlton, from sixth to 12th, and by Spencer, who went from 13th to 20th.

== Points tariff ==
In addition to standard ranking points, a &quot;merit&quot; point was awarded for losers in the last 32 of the World Championship, and a half merit point awarded to losers in the last 32 of other ranking tournaments. No points were awarded to a player who did not win any matches in a given tournament (for example, a top 16 player seeded into the last 32 of the world championship would not win any merit points if they lost their first match). Merit points were only used to determine placings between players that had an equal opportunity to earn them; players in the top 16 could not earn merit points from tournaments where they were exempted into the last-32 round. Players ranked from 77 to 102 had no ranking or merit points, with their positions determined by their performances in the 1985 World Snooker Championship, with frames won being taken into consideration if the round reached was equal.

== Rankings ==

The rankings for the 1985/1986 season are shown in the tables below.

<text>Rodney Philip Hide (born 16 December 1956) is a former New Zealand politician of the ACT New Zealand party. Hide was a Member of Parliament for ACT from 1996 until 2011, was ACT&#x27;s leader between 2004 and 2011, and represented the constituency from 2005 to 2011. In the Fifth National Government, Hide was Minister of Local Government, Associate Minister of Commerce and Minister of Regulatory Reform until 2011.

He stepped down as ACT leader in April 2011 after a leadership challenge from Don Brash and retired from Parliament at the general election later that year.

==Early life==
Rodney Philip Hide was born in Oxford in Canterbury. His father, Philip Hide, owned a small mixed-farm at Cust and also drove trucks. In 1960, due to sickness, Philip Hide sold the small farm and moved to Rangiora, continuing to drive trucks until his retirement. Rodney Hide attended Rangiora High School, before gaining a degree in zoology and botany from the University of Canterbury. After completing his degree, he travelled overseas, eventually finding himself in Scotland. He worked for some time on oil rigs in the North Sea. Hide eventually returned to New Zealand by way of Romania, Egypt, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. In Malaysia he re-met Jiuan Jiuan—with whom he had shared a house in Christchurch—and the two married in 1983. They were to separate in 2007.

After returning to New Zealand, Hide gained a degree in resource management from Lincoln College, Canterbury. He then took up a teaching position at Lincoln, first in resource management and later in economics. He completed his master&#x27;s degree in economics from Montana State University with a thesis on New Zealand&#x27;s transferable fishing quotas.

In 1993, Alan Gibbs, an Auckland businessman, offered Hide a job as an economist. He accepted, and also began working at a radio station owned by Gibbs. Later, Hide also met Roger Douglas, a former Minister of Finance whose radical economic reforms Rogernomics had made a considerable impression on him.

When Douglas established the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers (which later formed the ACT party), Hide had close involvement as the organisation&#x27;s first chairman and president.

==Member of Parliament==



Hide first entered Parliament in 1996 as a list MP. He won the party parliamentary leadership role in a closely contested primary after the retirement of Richard Prebble in 2004. He then went on to win the Epsom electorate from sitting National Party MP Richard Worth in 2005 with the campaign message &quot;ACT is back&quot;. He retained this seat in the .

Hide had a reputation for strong views, for his media profile, and for his confrontational style. In 2002, when Hide still sat on the back benches, one commentator described him the &quot;leader of the opposition&quot;. Hide&#x27;s supporters often described him as one of the most effective opposition MPs, and praised him for his motivation and commitment.

===Entry into Parliament===
Hide held the seventh place on the ACT party list for the 1996 election. ACT received enough votes for Hide to enter Parliament, making him one of the party&#x27;s &quot;founding&quot; MPs. He gradually rose through the party&#x27;s ranks, reaching second place in the ACT list for the 2002 election.

In his maiden speech, Hide made a specific attack on &quot;&quot; enjoyed by MPs, and this &quot;perk-busting&quot; became a characteristic of his political career until he was himself exposed for taking advantage of such perks, in taking his girlfriend on a tax payer funded trip to London and Hawaii. Hide still however claims to have developed a substantial reputation for finding and exposing &quot;scandals&quot;, whether they relate to MPs&#x27; perks or to other governmental matters. Hide&#x27;s critics often claim that his &quot;scandals&quot; rely on sensationalism and exaggeration, and have as their only purpose the gaining of media attention; but his supporters believe that Hide&#x27;s constant scrutiny &quot;keeps the government honest&quot; and ensures that the administration does not waste taxpayers&#x27; money.

Roger Douglas himself has emerged as one of Hide&#x27;s more prominent critics, referring to Hide&#x27;s &quot;stunts&quot; as detracting from ACT&#x27;s core economic message, shifting focus to populist issues of law and order and to provocative race relations policies. At a party conference, Douglas condemned MPs &quot;who run any fickle line capable of grabbing short-term votes and attention&quot;, a comment allegedly directed at Hide or at his supporters. Hide acknowledges the criticism, but defends himself on the grounds that a focus on pure economic theory will not attract interest: &quot;the problem is that the so-called stunts are particularly well-reported and my work explaining free market ideas disappears without trace.&quot; The tension between Douglas and Hide increased when Hide made a bid for the vice-presidency of ACT in 2000: supporters of Douglas interpreted this action as a challenge to Douglas&#x27; organisational authority within the party. Both Douglas and Hide stood down from their roles as president and vice-president, suggesting an uneasy truce between these two factions. In 2008 the two men worked closely together with Douglas holding third place on the party list following Hide and Heather Roy.

===ACT Party leadership===
Many people had known for some time that Hide saw himself as a potential parliamentary leader of the ACT party, and he himself showed no reluctance in saying so. At several points, rumours circulated that Hide planned to challenge party leader Richard Prebble for his position, although such a challenge never emerged. When Prebble eventually announced his retirement, his critics claimed that this had been brought about by secret campaigning by Hide. However, Prebble himself has denied this claim and it appears more likely that he stood down for personal reasons, as he publicly claimed.

When Prebble announced his retirement, Hide quickly indicated that he would seek the caucus leadership. Prebble, however, appeared unenthusiastic about the prospect of Hide succeeding him, and in a speech praising each of the new leadership contenders, pointedly dwelled on the others. The succession method chosen by Prebble also appeared to disfavour Hide: rather than a simple caucus vote, which a conventional leadership challenge would have called, a four-way election involved all ACT party members (although the election remained only &quot;indicative&quot;). Many people consider that the party organisation, in which Douglas has considerable influence, dislikes Hide.

Hide campaigned against Stephen Franks, Ken Shirley, and Muriel Newman for the ACT party parliamentary leadership. In the race he claimed that his high public profile and his image of strength would prove crucial to ACT&#x27;s political survival. Stephen Franks, seen as the primary &quot;anti-Hide&quot; candidate and a social conservative, had the backing of Roger Douglas. In the end, however, Hide prevailed, and the party introduced Hide as its new leader on 13 June 2004.

Under Hide&#x27;s leadership, the vote in the September 2005 election severely reduced ACT&#x27;s party parliamentary representation. ACT&#x27;s share of the party vote dropped from over 7% of the total in to around 1.5%; its representation in Parliament fell from nine MPs to two. Despite this reduction, the party remained in parliament due to Hide winning the Epsom seat. As a consequence of its reduced share of the vote, ACT received a significant cut in taxpayer-funded Parliamentary resourcing and Hide shifted his electorate office in Remuera to Newmarket, the same location as that of ACT&#x27;s head office.

As a post-election strategy, Rodney Hide focused on his high-profile attacks on prominent Labour Party MPs. His campaign against alleged abuse of schoolchildren by Labour Party minister David Benson-Pope, which was verified by the now grown children involved, continued to make headlines in late 2005. In 2006, Hide voiced speculation on the leadership cadre of the National Party (then led by Don Brash), a strategy which gained him headlines but complicated the once co-operative relationship between ACT and National.

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
In 2006, Hide appeared as a contestant in the celebrity-based &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; television series, in which he, paired with professional dancer Krystal Stuart, competing against other celebrities. Funds raised through his performance went to St John Ambulance. Hide stated that he appeared on the show as a personal challenge, having never danced before, and despite harsh criticism from the show&#x27;s judges placed fourth, after dropping his dance partner.

===ACT in Government===
At the , Hide retained his Epsom seat; with a subsequent rise in party popularity, ACT increased its representation in parliament from two seats to five. The National Party won the most seats and formed a minority government with the support of ACT, the Māori Party and United Future. Hide was appointed as a Minister outside Cabinet and was appointed to the office of the Minister of Local Government, Minister for Regulatory Reform and Associate Minister of Commerce.

One of the main focuses of Hide&#x27;s work in cabinet was the Auckland &#x27;Super City&#x27; proposal for unification of the various local authorities of Auckland. This initiative was started by the then-Labour government in 2007, which set up a Royal Commission to investigate the local government arrangements in the Auckland region. The Commission reported back in 2009, but Hide and Prime Minister John Key announced that several of the commission&#x27;s recommendations would not be accepted. In particular, the proposed six district sub-councils would be replaced by a local structure of 20–30 community boards. The recommendation to have separate concept Maori representation was also not accepted.

Hide faced criticism from various parties over the local authority amalgamation. Issues of satellite city boundaries, assets, financing &amp; political consolidation were raised by North Shore City mayor Andrew Williams in 2009. That same year, the Labour Party accused Hide of mismanaging the Auckland reform process and criticised Hide&#x27;s advocacy of privatising council assets and services. Labour also alleged that a bad process had led to the centralisation of power in the hands of a privileged few. In 2010, a &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; editorial made five further criticisms of Hide&#x27;s implementation of the &#x27;super city&#x27; amalgamation:
# Hide had a bad track record of consultation in the design of the single city,
# He was plainly driven by his ideological agenda,
# He had threatened to resign if the Prime Minister acceded to a strong call for Maori seats,
# He had ignored concerns about the lack of power of local boards, and,
# as much as 90 per cent of services were to be run by seven Government-appointed boards.
Despite these criticisms, the amalgamation went ahead and the first Auckland Council elections were held in 2010.

===Leadership questioned===
In November 2009, a special ACT-party caucus meeting was held to discuss the Hide&#x27;s position as party leader, where he was chosen to be retained.

On 28 April 2011, he resigned as leader of ACT after a successful challenge from former National leader Don Brash. Hide indicated to Brash he would not be standing in the 2011 general election. When he left parliament he chose not to give a valedictory speech.

==Political views==

===Perk busting===
Hide was criticised in November 2009 for taking his girlfriend Louise Crome on a tax-payer funded private holiday to Hawaii and on a tax-payer funded trip to London, Canada and the United States. He repaid the money for the Hawaii trip. These allegations were particularly notable given Hide&#x27;s history as a self-styled parliamentary perk-buster, particularly in Opposition.

===Climate change===
As ACT leader, Hide criticised Labour&#x27;s emissions trading scheme in September 2008. stating &quot;the entire climate change – global warming hypothesis is a hoax... the data and the hypothesis do not hold together... Al Gore is a phoney and a fraud on this issue, and... the emissions trading scheme is a worldwide scam and swindle&quot;. He said that the legislation would drive up the cost of basic goods, ruining businesses and farmers. In November 2008, after ACT had negotiated with National for a review of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; journalist Brian Rudman commented that Hide had &quot;fruitcake views on global warming&quot;.

In 2010, in a speech to Parliament, Hide compared government-funded climate science to the Spanish inquisition. He also accused the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research of being involved in a scandal with its temperature data and claimed that its scientific credibility was shredded.

In 2012, Hide continued to write opinion articles in the press questioning climate science and emissions trading schemes. In the &quot;National Business Review&quot;, Hide claimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 was &#x27;infamously wrong&#x27; and contained schoolboy errors and had been written by people who had to &#x27;believe the human-induced global warming nonsense before they start&#x27;. In the Herald, Hide said that the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a &#x27;scam and a waste&#x27;. Hide agreed that CO2 from fossil fuels is a greenhouse gas that has caused warming, but that the warming wasn&#x27;t worrying until the effect had been multiplied with computer models that are programmed to cause scary climate change.
==Life after Parliament==

In December 2011 Hide was granted the right to retain the title of The Honourable in recognition of his term as a Member of the Executive Council of New Zealand. He was also appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order in the 2013 New Year Honours, for services as a member of Parliament.

Hide wrote a political column for the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; for a time, and has also worked as a casual labourer.
Following news of Operation Yewtree in Britain and the subsequent trial of Australian entertainer Rolf Harris, a member of the New Zealand Parliament, Maggie Barry, described a groping by Harris during a studio interview she conducted in her previous broadcasting career. Hide taunted her in his newspaper column, urging her to use her parliamentary privilege to breach the name suppression order protecting the defendant in the Queenstown suppressed indecency case.

As of 2014, Hide is now married to Louise Crome, and the couple have two girls and one son, and Hide has a son from his previous marriage.

In February 2022, Hide expressed support for the Convoy 2022 New Zealand protesters who had camped outside Parliament. In an open letter, he supported the protesters&#x27; opposition to the Labour Government&#x27;s vaccine mandate and expressed disappointment with ACT leader David Seymour, who had distanced himself from the marches while stressing his belief in the right to protest. Hide also criticised the ACT party&#x27;s support for the Government&#x27;s lockdown and vaccine mandates, citing his belief in &quot;human freedoms.&quot;

By 2022, Hide had joined &quot;The Platform&quot;, an online radio station founded by veteran broadcaster Sean Plunket. By March 2023, Hide had left The Platform and became a host on the anti-vaccination group Voices for Freedom&#x27;s online radio station Reality Check Radio.

Since 2002, the line-up consists of Chris Cheney (vocals, guitar), Scott Owen (double bass, vocals), and Andy Strachan (drums). The band rose to fame in 1997 after the release of their EP &quot;Second Solution / Prisoner of Society&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. They have released eight studio albums, two of which reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: &quot;The Living End&quot; (October 1998) and &quot;State of Emergency&quot; (February 2006). They have also achieved chart success in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.

The Band was nominated 27 times and won five awards at the Australian ARIA Music Awards ceremonies: &quot;Highest Selling Single&quot; for &quot;Second Solution / Prisoner of Society&quot; (1998), &quot;Breakthrough Artist – Album&quot; and &quot;Best Group&quot; for &quot;The Living End&quot; (1999), as well as &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; for &quot;White Noise&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating&quot; (2011). In October 2010, their debut album was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described the group as &quot;one of Australia’s premier rock acts. By blending a range of styles (punk, rockabilly and flat out rock) with great success, The Living End has managed to produce anthemic choruses and memorable songs in abundance&quot;.

==History==

===Beginnings (1994–1996)===
The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns and backing popular Melbourne cover band Mercury Blue at the Wheelers Hill Hotel/Pub. Cheney later recalled &quot;[w]e played to all the jivers and rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne&#x27;s rockabilly scene&quot;. As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school.

By 1994, Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band&#x27;s name to The Living End – a reference to the film, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1956). According to Cheney &quot;It&#x27;s an old &#x27;50s term, meaning &#x27;far out&#x27;, &#x27;the greatest&#x27; ... We were still into the whole &#x27;50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn&#x27;t suggest any one style of music&quot;. With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.

During that year they recorded a track, &quot;Headlines&quot;, which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for Green Day&#x27;s 1995 Australian tour. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, &quot;Hellbound&quot;, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included &quot;Headlines&quot; from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP&#x27;s sound: &quot;they turned their back on &#x27;50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk&quot;.

In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, &quot;It&#x27;s for Your Own Good&quot;, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, &quot;From Here on In&quot;, which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey&#x27;s drum style was compared with The Who&#x27;s Keith Moon. &quot;From Here on In&quot; was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, &quot;Occasional Course Language&quot;.

===Breakout single to debut album (1997–1999)===
The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, &quot;Second Solution&quot; / &quot;Prisoner of Society&quot;, was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. &quot;Second Solution&quot; / &quot;Prisoner of Society&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50.

In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;. &quot;Second Solution&quot; was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, &quot;Cheats&quot;, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 &quot;Prisoner of Society&quot; was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs Chart.

The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4× Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, &quot;Save the Day&quot;, was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist – Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

===&quot;Roll On&quot; (2000–2001)===
The Living End&#x27;s second album, &quot;Roll On&quot;, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although &quot;Roll On&quot; was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had &quot;broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact [sic] what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics&quot;. The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; &quot;[it&#x27;s] an absolute scorcher! That&#x27;s what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot&quot;.

Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, &quot;Prisoner of Society&quot;, and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″ Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash&#x27;s creative breakthrough, &quot;London Calling&quot; (December 1979), as they &quot;stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock &amp; roll – and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don&#x27;t quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you&#x27;d be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party&quot;. Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in &#x27;procrastinating&#x27; structures. This defined the album&#x27;s creativity.

The album&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;Pictures in the Mirror&quot; and the title track, peaked into the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. &quot;Pictures in the Mirror&quot; also reached the top 20 in New Zealand, while &quot;Roll On&quot; peaked at No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs Chart, and appeared in the top 150 of the UK Singles Chart. In March 2001 &quot;Billboard&quot;″s review of &quot;Roll On&quot; described their sound as &quot;Aussie punkabilly&quot;, while the group&#x27;s lyrics show a &quot;socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict&quot;. The trio received US-wide coverage by playing on both Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s and David Letterman&#x27;s late-night variety shows. The album included &quot;Carry me Home&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; soundtrack. However, touring in support of &quot;Roll On&quot; and the related singles was halted after Cheney had a car accident on the Great Ocean Road, rendering him unable to play for a significant period of time: he was &quot;hospitalised for 2 months&quot;. He had been on travelling to the house of a member of fellow Australian band and tour mates, Bodyjar.

===The Longnecks to &quot;Modern ARTillery&quot; (2002–2005)===

In February 2002, The Living End&#x27;s line up changed as Demsey left and was replaced on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted to spend more time with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, &quot;Modern ARTillery&quot;, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley &amp; The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster &amp; The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria.

In mid-2002 The Living End recorded four tracks, including &quot;One Said to the Other&quot;, which were released as an EP in January the following year and reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two of its tracks were re-recorded in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jebediah) producing, together with new material for &quot;Modern ARTillery&quot;, which appeared on 28 October 2003. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 50 in New Zealand, and top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Heatseekers Albums Chart. &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Save Us?&quot; was issued a month earlier, as the lead single, which reached top 40 in Australia, top 30 in New Zealand and on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs Chart. They followed with heavy touring (including Big Day Out) promoting their releases.

On 27 September 2004 the band released a compilation album, &quot;From Here on In: The Singles 1997-2004&quot;, early versions included a bonus disc, &quot;Under the Covers&quot;, which had six cover versions of other artist&#x27;s tracks. The CD featured two new tracks: &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot; and &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. They also issued a compilation DVD, &quot;From Here on In: The DVD 1997–2004&quot;, which collated their music video clips and live performances of the groups at festivals: Splendour in the Grass and Big Day Out in Sydney, and from Summer Sonic in Japan. The DVD also documented the band&#x27;s history by interviews and home footage.

===&quot;State of Emergency&quot; (2005–2007)===

The Living End&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, was recorded in Byron Bay with Launay producing, following the band&#x27;s appearance at Splendour in the Grass. The recording and the artwork was completed in mid-December 2005, and the album was released on 4 February the following year. The Living End had again played gigs as The Longnecks, before recording the album, to test out the new material. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in its first week, it reached top 40 in New Zealand, and on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Songs Chart.

The lead single, &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Radio?&quot;, had been issued in November 2005, and reached No. 9 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, was released in February just after the album and reached No. 5. It became their highest charting single in New Zealand where it peaked at No. 12. The third single, &quot;Long Live the Weekend&quot;, was released in May, and appeared in the top 30 in Australia. The fourth single, &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot;, was released in August and also reached the top 40. The album was nominated for the 2006 J Award.

The album was issued in the US through Green Day&#x27;s Armstrong&#x27;s Adeline Records along with Eastwest Records on 11 July 2006 and in Canada a week later. Another release in support of the album was the DVD, &quot;Live at Festival Hall&quot;, on 30 September, which captured a Melbourne performance during the State of Emergency Tour, and featured many songs from the album, and earlier tracks. On 20 June 2006 the band received four Jack Awards: Best Live Band, Best Live TV Performance, Best Performer (Cheney) and Best Drummer (Strachan). Thereby the group achieved the most awards in a year and, at eight overall, the most by any artist. During the 2006 State of Emergency tour, the Living End&#x27;s show in Milwaukee was cancelled, so it was rescheduled on 2 December as a support act for +44.

On 6 October Cheney left the band because he felt burnt out, he was sick of the constant touring, as well as experiencing writer&#x27;s block. Cheney felt that he needed to get away from the band and develop other aspects of his life. This information was kept confidential until 2008. Early in 2007 Cheney had isolated himself from his bandmates while trying to write tracks for a follow-up to &quot;State of Emergency&quot;. He was disappointed with the results so he took up yoga, spent time painting and being around his baby daughter whilst taking a break from music for the first time in 10 years. During this period the band released a radio-only single, a cover version of Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, available on the &quot;Standing on the Outside&quot; (March 2007), a Cold Chisel tribute album by various Australian artists. After Cheney overcame his writer&#x27;s block and was convinced not to leave the band, the group played The Great Escape in April 2007 and restarted work on their fifth studio album. They toured the UK in August that year, releasing &quot;State of Emergency&quot; there on 13 August through Deck Cheese Records.

===&quot;White Noise&quot; (2008–2009)===

The Living End released their fifth studio album, &quot;White Noise&quot;, on 19 July 2008. The trio had performed at &quot;The Age&quot;″s Entertainment Guide&#x27;s EG Awards in Melbourne in December 2007. Two new songs had been premiered, &quot;Raise the Alarm&quot; and &quot;How Do We Know&quot;. During February the following year they played gigs as The Longnecks to test out more new material prior to recording. The gigs were described by Cheney as the most exciting of their career, &quot;there is a heaviness and depth to the new stuff that we simply haven&#x27;t had before&quot;.

Pre-production for the album took place at Studio One in Collingwood, Melbourne with producer Kalju Tonuma. This included various co-writes including the track &quot;Sum of Us&quot;. After the sonic blueprint of the album was established, producer John Agnello (Sonic Youth, The Hold Steady) was engaged to commence recording at Water Music Studios in Hoboken, New Jersey, for their new label, Dew Process, on the week beginning 31 March. Cheney felt Agnello &quot;[could] capture the energy and attack we are after&quot;. Brendan O&#x27;Brien mixed the record at Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. &quot;The Age&quot;″s Andrew Murfett declared they &quot;have never been able to convey the energy and power of their live shows on record ... [this album] is fresh, diverse and relatively honest, and TLE suddenly got a lot more interesting&quot;. &quot;White Noise&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart in its first week, it reached No. 18 in New Zealand – becoming their highest charting album there. In support of the album, they made TV appearances, including a performance on 5 October at the 2008 NRL Grand Final at ANZ Stadium. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, &quot;White Noise&quot; was awarded the Best Rock Album, over efforts from Gyroscope and Faker.

The first single issued from the album included the title track. Another song, &quot;How Do We Know&quot;, was simultaneously released as a radio-only track on Triple J, and was heard on other radio stations, such as Nova 969. The tracks formed a double A-sided single, which was issued both physically and digitally in July 2008. It reached No. 12 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and top 30 in New Zealand. &quot;White Noise&quot; had almost a year-and-a-half of writing behind it, showing &quot;more of a hard rock influence&quot; and the group declared it&#x27;s &quot;the best thing we&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. In September that year a second single, &quot;Moment in the Sun&quot;, was released to Australian radio; it was physically and digitally released a month later. In December &quot;Raise the Alarm&quot; was released to radio as the third single. A music video had been issued containing footage of live performances during the White Noise Tour and some others. In February 2009 the band made a secret appearance in Melbourne supporting the Stray Cats on their Farewell Tour. In May The Living End started the Raise the Alarm Tour.

===&quot;The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating&quot; (2010–2015)===

During September and October 2010 The Living End performed under another alias, Safety Matches, testing new material, similar to the previous usage of The Longnecks, for their sixth album, &quot;The Ending Is Just The Beginning Repeating&quot;. The tracks vetted included &quot;United&quot;, &quot;Universe&quot;, &quot;Away from the City&quot; (then-titled &quot;Black and White&quot;), the title track, &quot;Resist&quot; and &quot;Heatwave&quot;. In the January 2011 edition of The Living End&#x27;s News, Cheney revealed &quot;[h]aving spent all of 2010 writing album 6 we have amassed something in the vicinity of 40+ songs to choose from... There are some really different ideas kicking around this time but the emphasis has been on creating a cohesive album that is heavy, melodic and overall very anthemic&quot;.

The title track was premiered as the lead single in early June 2011 on national radio stations. The album appeared on 22 July that year, it was produced by Nick DiDia (Powderfinger). On 17 July Triple J played tracks from the album with further tracks played through the week prior to its release. The Living End also allowed fans on their mailing list a 24-hour stream of the record on 18 July. Fans could listen as many times as they wanted and were able to comment on the stream. In support of the album a live stream of a performance occurred on YouTube on 19 July. This featured an additional guitarist as well as Cheney playing rhythm guitar. From 2011 the band has employed Adrian Lombardi (ex-Mid Youth Crisis, Blueline Medic) on stage as their second guitarist. In July 2012 Cheney announced on Triple J that throughout November and December of that year, as part of The Retrospective Tour, they would perform each of their six studio albums over a week, in each of five Australian state capitals (Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne).

The Living End played in the UK and Germany throughout August and September 2013, and headlined at the Summernats 27 in Canberra in 2014.

The Living End also played at the 2014 Soundwave Festival in Australia as a replacement for Stone Temple Pilots who had to pull out due to scheduling conflicts with the recording of their next album.

The Living End supported Cold Chisel in their One Night Stand tour, with shows at Townsville, Darwin, Perth, Macedon Ranges and Sydney.

===&quot;Shift&quot; (2015–2017)===
The Living End announced they finished their seventh studio album in 2015. On 15 March 2016, the band released a song called &quot;Monkey&quot; as a taste of the album. &quot;Monkey&quot; is not the first official single off the album but was played live at the Decades Music Festival in 2015, along with another track called &quot;Death&quot;. On 21 March 2016 the band officially announced the new album, &quot;Shift&quot; with a release date of 13 May 2016, alongside a national tour and the release of the single, &quot;Keep on Running&quot;.

&quot;Staring Down The Barrel&quot;, the final single from the album, was released in October 2016. The song was inspired by Cheney&#x27;s battles with alcohol.

===&quot;Wunderbar&quot; (2018–present)===

On 22 June 2018, The Living End released a new song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose It&quot;. The band played two special pub shows in Sydney and Melbourne to launch the new single.

On 10 July 2018, the band officially announced their eighth album, &quot;Wunderbar&quot;, with a release date of 28 September 2018. Following this announcement, a video was launched for the previously released single &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose It&quot;. The video is a parody of reality talent contests, such as The Voice and Idols, and features cameos from many Australian musicians and personalities, such as Jimmy Barnes, Jane Gazzo, Molly Meldrum, Daryl Braithwaite and Murray Cook.

&quot;Wunderbar&quot; was recorded over a six-week period in February 2018, in Berlin, Germany, with producer Tobias Kuhn. Kuhn was brought on as producer after being recommended by German punk band, Die Toten Hosen. &quot;Wunderbar&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA charts.

==Musical style and influences==
The Living End consider themselves to be a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band based on punk ethics, citing The Clash, Iggy Pop, The Who and The Jam as influences and bands with whom they share the same ideals, making a social commentary on what&#x27;s going on around them. They have also been compared favorably to 1990s punk revivalists Rancid. However, the band do not consider themselves a punk band, more a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band who are influenced by punk. Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed their debut album, he noted their &quot;sound owes far more to the Ramones than it does to Eddie Cochran, or even the Clash, but they&#x27;ve cleverly appropriated certain rockabilly signatures – most ridiculously, the upright acoustic bass – that give their homage to the golden age of punk a bit of charm&quot;.

Cheney regards 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, including Elvis Presley, as his greatest influence and first musical love which, along with 1980s rockabilly revival band Stray Cats, the band&#x27;s sound was based on.

Owen has said that his favourite bands include Stray Cats, Reverend Horton Heat, Midnight Oil, The Clash, The Jam, Green Day, Sublime, Bodyjar, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Rancid, The Beatles and Supergrass. Owen regards Lee Rocker of Stray Cats as his main performance influence, mimicking the right hand movements of Rocker on the upright bass when he first learnt how to play.

As The Runaway Boys the trio had performed 1950s rock revival to &quot;all the jivers and rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers&quot;. They also regard Australian pub rock as an important influence on the band, something the members grew up with and appreciated. Other rockabilly influences include Reverend Horton Heat and Eddie Cochran Their rockabilly influences were tempered by exposure to differing forms &quot;[w]e&#x27;d support a jazz band one night, and a metal band the following. It helped us a lot&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s MacKenzie Wilson found that by &quot;Roll On&quot; the group had grown up &quot;but continue to rampage on with their rowdy punkabilly ... their sophomore effort pulls toward their Aussie rock roots (AC/DC, Rose Tattoo) and a touch of British class for an eager modification&quot;.

They acknowledge the inspiration of 1970s punk groups and The Sharp. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s review of &quot;Roll On&quot; described their sound as &quot;Aussie punkabilly&quot;, while the group&#x27;s lyrics show a &quot;socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict&quot; The Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online website reviewed their early releases, with &quot;The Living End&quot; described as &quot;anthemic and attitudinous brand of rockabilly-meets-punk (circa Clash not SoCal)&quot;; &quot;Roll On&quot; had them as &quot;kings of rockapunkerbilly&quot;; for &quot;Modern Artillery&quot; Cheney&#x27;s lyrics were lauded with &quot;every time I expect the quality to wane, a new level is reached&quot; and the band itself showed that &quot;Nobody plays nitro-powered punkabilly faster or tighter than this combo and &quot;Modern Artillery&quot; represents the band&#x27;s finest hour&quot;. However Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus found that album showed that the &quot;bawdy gang vocals of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Roll On&quot; have been replaced by sculpted multi-tracking ... guitars punch mightily, and the choruses detonate, but they do in colors easily identifiable to a throng of American baby punks with silver safety pins in their mouths&quot;.

Allmusic&#x27;s Hal Horowitz found that by &quot;State of Emergency&quot; the group &quot;takes its Stray Cats strut and Reverend Horton Heat bluster and continues to channel it into a more commercially viable pop/punk sound ... [it] sounds more like a buffed up Jam album, all snappy hooks and impassioned vocals over a rollicking set of songs&quot;. Fellow Allmusic reviewer Adam Greenberg found that on &quot;White Noise&quot; the group &quot;experiments a bit with new sounds but also seems to hang right on the edge of what they had been doing previously&quot;. Dave Donnelly opined that the band &quot;have been mining the territory between pop-punk and rockabilly for well over a decade now, and their experience shines through in the slick musicianship&quot; of &quot;The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating&quot;.

Amongst other bands, Sum 41 guitarist Dave Baksh has suggested that it would be great if he could tour with The Living End, saying that they&#x27;re all &quot;really good musicians&quot;.

==Collaborations==
The Living End have made recordings with many popular bands and artists. In 1998, just as they were gaining popularity in Australia, they performed at &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; for the peace keepers in East Timor. At this, their first live concert to Australians, they performed two tracks from what was their upcoming album, as well as performing with The Angels&#x27; frontman Doc Neeson and &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; with Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue.

In December 1998, supporting the German band Die Toten Hosen they played a cover of Slade&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; with them on 26 December 1998 in Düsseldorf, as part of Die Toten Hosen&#x27;s 1998 Christmas tour of Germany. The two bands met on the 1998 inaugural Warped Tour of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Hawaii. In early 2001 The Living End performed as the support act for AC/DC during the Australian leg of their &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; world tour.

For their 2000 release, How It Works, Cheney performed backing vocals on Bodyjar&#x27;s song &quot;Halfway Around The World&quot;.

Lead singer and guitarist Chris Cheney was also a member of the &quot;super group&quot; The Wrights who released covers of Stevie Wright&#x27;s songs, &quot;Evie Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3&quot; after performing &quot;Evie Part 1&quot; at the 2004 Australian Music Industry&#x27;s ARIA Music Awards. Cheney also played guitar and contributed backing vocals to &quot;Private School Kid&quot; on Sarah McLeod&#x27;s (formerly of The Superjesus) debut solo album. Cheney appeared as a guest guitarist on Stephen Cummings Firecracker album.

The Living End performed alongside Normie Rowe performing two of Normie&#x27;s hits &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; and &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; at the 2005 ARIA Hall of Fame. In 2005, the band recorded a version of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Shuffle&quot; with Jimmy Barnes on his duet album &quot;Double Happiness&quot;.

<text>Thomas Crombie Schelling (April 14, 1921 – December 13, 2016) was an American economist and professor of foreign policy, national security, nuclear strategy, and arms control at the School of Public Policy at University of Maryland, College Park. He was also co-faculty at the New England Complex Systems Institute.

Schelling was awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with Robert Aumann) for &quot;having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game theory analysis.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early years===
Schelling was born on April 14, 1921, in Oakland, California. He graduated from San Diego High School. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1944 and received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1951.

===Career===
Schelling served with the Marshall Plan in Europe, the White House, and the Executive Office of the President from 1948 to 1953. He wrote most of his dissertation on national income behavior working at night while in Europe. He left government to join the economics faculty at Yale University.

In 1956, &quot;he joined the RAND Corporation as an adjunct fellow, becoming a full-time researcher for a year after leaving Yale, and returning to adjunct status through 2002.&quot; In 1958 Schelling was appointed professor of economics at Harvard. That same year, he &quot;co-founded the Center for International Affairs, which was [later] renamed the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.&quot;

In 1969, Schelling joined Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, where he was the Lucius N. Littauer Professor of Political Economy. He was among the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the &quot;modern&quot; Kennedy School, as he helped to shift the curriculum&#x27;s emphasis away from administration and more toward leadership.

Between 1994 and 1999, he conducted research at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Laxenburg, Austria.

In 1990, he left Harvard and joined the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and the University of Maryland Department of Economics. In 1991, he accepted the presidency of the American Economic Association, an organization of which he was also a Distinguished Fellow.

In 1995, he accepted the presidency of the Eastern Economic Association.

Schelling was a contributing participant of the Copenhagen Consensus.

==Honors and awards==
In 1977, Schelling received The Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy.

In 1993, he was awarded the Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War from the National Academy of Sciences.

He received honorary doctorates from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 2003, Yale University in 2009, and RAND Graduate School of Public Analysis, as well as an honorary degree from the University of Manchester in 2010.

He was awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, along with Robert Aumann, for &quot;having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis.&quot;

In 2008 he was the Witten Lecturer at the Witten/Herdecke University as the awardee of the Witten Lectures in Economics and Philosophy.

===Personal life===
Schelling was married to Corinne Tigay Saposs from 1947 to 1991, with whom he had four sons. Later in 1991 he married Alice M. Coleman, who brought two sons to the marriage; they became his stepsons.

Schelling died on December 13, 2016, in Bethesda, Maryland, from complications following a hip fracture at the age of 95.

Schelling&#x27;s family auctioned his Nobel award medal, fetching $187,000. They donated this money to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an American 501 nonprofit legal advocacy organization specializing in civil rights and public interest litigation. Alice Schelling said her late husband had credited &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse&quot; by Will James, the winner of the Newbery Medal in 1927, as the most influential book he had read.

==Notable works==

===&quot;The Strategy of Conflict&quot; (1960)===
&quot;The Strategy of Conflict&quot;, which Schelling published in 1960, pioneered the study of bargaining and strategic behavior in what he refers to as &quot;conflict behavior.&quot; &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; in 1995 ranked it as one of the 100 most influential books in the 50 years since 1945. In this book Schelling introduced concepts such as the &quot;focal point&quot; and &quot;credible commitment.&quot; In a 1961 review, International Relations scholar Morton Kaplan described the book as a &quot;strikingly original contribution&quot; and a &quot;landmark in the literature.&quot;

Schelling&#x27;s book comprised a series of scholarly journal articles that he had published over the period 1957–1960.

Schelling encourages in his work a strategic view toward conflict that is equally &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;successful.&quot; He believes that conflict cannot be based merely on one&#x27;s intelligence but must also address the &quot;advantages&quot; associated with a course of action. He considers that the advantages that are gleaned should be firmly fixed in a value system that is both &quot;explicit&quot; and &quot;consistent.&quot;

Also, conflict has a distinct meaning. In Schelling&#x27;s approach, it is not enough to defeat an opponent, but one must also seize opportunities to co-operate of which there are usually many. He points out that it is only on the rarest of occasions, in what is known as &quot;pure conflict,&quot; that the participants&#x27; interests are implacably opposed. He uses the example of &quot;a war of complete extermination&quot; to illustrate this phenomenon.

Co-operation, if available, may take many forms and thus potentially involve everything from &quot;deterrence, limited war, and disarmament&quot; to &quot;negotiation.&quot; Indeed, it is through such actions that participants are left with less of a conflict and more of a &quot;bargaining situation.&quot; The bargaining itself is best thought of in terms of the other participant&#x27;s actions, as any gains one might realize are highly dependent upon the &quot;choices or decisions&quot; of their opponent.

Communication between parties, though, is another matter entirely. Verbal or written communication is known as &quot;explicit,&quot; and involves such activities as &quot;offering concessions.&quot; What happens, though, when this type of communication becomes impossible or improbable? This is when something called &quot;tacit maneuvers&quot; become important. Think of this as action-based communication. Schelling uses the example of one&#x27;s occupation or evacuation of strategic territory to illustrate this latter communication method.

In an article celebrating Schelling&#x27;s Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics, Michael Kinsley, &quot;Washington Post&quot; op‑ed columnist and one of Schelling&#x27;s former students, anecdotally summarizes Schelling&#x27;s reorientation of game theory thus: &quot;[Y]ou&#x27;re standing at the edge of a cliff, chained by the ankle to someone else. You&#x27;ll be released, and one of you will get a large prize, as soon as the other gives in. How do you persuade the other guy to give in, when the only method at your disposal—threatening to push him off the cliff—would doom you both? Answer: You start dancing, closer and closer to the edge. That way, you don&#x27;t have to convince him that you would do something totally irrational: plunge him and yourself off the cliff. You just have to convince him that you are prepared to take a higher risk than he is of accidentally falling off the cliff. If you can do that, you win.&quot;

===&quot;Arms and Influence&quot; (1966)===
Schelling&#x27;s theories about war were extended in &quot;Arms and Influence&quot;, published in 1966. According to the publisher, the book &quot;carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier &quot;The Strategy of Conflict&quot; (1960) and &quot;Strategy and Arms Control&quot; (with Morton Halperin, 1961), and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and diplomacy.&quot; Chapter headings include &quot;The Diplomacy of Violence&quot;, &quot;The Diplomacy of Ultimate Survival&quot; and &quot;The Dynamics of Mutual Alarm&quot;.

Within the work, Schelling discusses military capabilities and how they can be used as bargaining power. Instead of considering only the choices that are available on a surface level, one can think ahead to try to influence the other party to come to the desired conclusion. Specifically, Schelling mentions the actions taken by the U.S. during the Cuban and Berlin crises and how they functioned as not only preparation for war but also signals. For example, Schelling points out that the bombing of North Vietnam &quot;is as much coercive as tactical.&quot; Not only was the bombing to cripple their enemies armies, but it also served to bring Vietnam to the table for negotiations. Much of this writing was influenced largely due to Schelling&#x27;s personal interest in Game Theory and its application to nuclear armaments.

Schelling&#x27;s work influenced Robert Jervis.&quot;&quot;

===&quot;Micromotives and Macrobehavior&quot; (1978)===
In 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely-cited articles dealing with racial dynamics and what he termed &quot;a general theory of tipping.&quot; In those papers, he showed that a preference that one&#x27;s neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture &quot;up to some limit,&quot; can lead to total segregation. He thus argued that motives, malicious or not, were indistinguishable as to explaining the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. He used coins on graph paper to demonstrate his theory by placing pennies and dimes in different patterns on the &quot;board&quot; and then moving them one by one if they were in an &quot;unhappy&quot; situation.

Schelling&#x27;s dynamics has been cited as a way of explaining variations that are found in what are regarded as meaningful differencesgender, age, race, ethnicity, language, sexual preference, and religion. A cycle of such change, once it has begun, may have a self-sustaining momentum. Schelling&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Micromotives and Macrobehavior&quot; expanded on and generalized those themes and is often cited in the literature of agent-based computational economics.

==Global warming==
Schelling was involved in the global warming debate since chairing a commission for President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He believed climate change poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States was exaggerated. He wrote that,

Today, little of our gross domestic product is produced outdoors, and therefore, little is susceptible to climate. Agriculture and forestry are less than 3 percent of total output, and little else is much affected. Even if agricultural productivity declined by a third over the next half-century, the per capita GNP we might have achieved by 2050 we would still achieve in 2051. Considering that agricultural productivity in most parts of the world continues to improve (and that many crops may benefit directly from enhanced photosynthesis due to increased carbon dioxide), it is not at all certain that the net impact on agriculture will be negative or much noticed in the developed world.

Drawing on his experience with the Marshall Plan after World War II, he argued that addressing global warming is a bargaining problem: if the world were able to reduce emissions, poor countries would receive most of the benefits, but rich countries would bear most of the costs.

==Contributions to popular culture==
Stanley Kubrick read an article Schelling wrote that included a description of the Peter George novel &quot;Red Alert&quot;, and conversations between Kubrick, Schelling, and George eventually led to the 1964 movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;.

Schelling is also cited for the first known use of the phrase collateral damage in his May 1961 article &quot;Dispersal, Deterrence, and Damage&quot;.

In his book &quot;Choice and Consequence&quot;, he explored various topics such as nuclear terrorism, blackmail, daydreaming, and euthanasia, from a behavioral economics point of view.

<text>Lionel Sharples Penrose, FRS (11 June 1898 – 12 May 1972) was an English psychiatrist, medical geneticist, paediatrician, mathematician and chess theorist, who carried out pioneering work on the genetics of intellectual disability. Penrose was initially the Galton professor of eugenics (1945–1963) at University College London, before having his title changed to professor of human genetics (1963–1965) at his request. He was later emeritus professor.

==Education==
Penrose was educated at the Downs School, Colwall and the Quaker Leighton Park School, Reading. On leaving school in 1916, he served, as a conscientious objector, with the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit/British Red Cross in France until the end of the First World War. He went on to study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a Cambridge Apostle. At Cambridge, he gained a first class degree in moral sciences before leaving for Vienna for a year, to study at the psychological department at the University of Vienna. In 1928, he qualified with the conjoint in 1928 at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital before qualifying for a Doctor of Medicine in 1930.

==Career==
Penrose undertook research into schizophrenia, designing tests of intelligence that were non-verbal in nature that are still in use. He was one of the earliest investigators of phenylketonuria in the 1930s.

Penrose&#x27;s &quot;Colchester Survey&quot;, produced as the report in 1938, in collaboration with the MRC called the &quot;MRC special report: No.229, Clinical and genetic study of 1,280 cases of mental defect&quot;, was the earliest serious attempt to study the genetics of intellectual disability. He found that the relatives of patients with severe intellectual disability were usually unaffected but some of them were affected with similar severity to the original patient, whereas the relatives of patients with mild intellectual disability tended mostly to have mild or borderline disability. Penrose went on to identify and study many of the genetic and chromosomal causes of intellectual disability (then called mental deficiency). This body of work culminated in the book, &quot;The Biology of Mental Defect&quot; (Sidgwick and Jackson, Ltd., London, UK, 1949).

From 1939 to 1945 he was director of psychiatric research at the Ontario Hospital, lecturer in psychiatry at Western University, and medical statistician to the province. Penrose was a central figure in British medical genetics following World War II. From 1945 to 1965, he worked as Galton Professor at the Galton Laboratory at University College London. The first title of his chair was &quot;Professor of Eugenics&quot; (1945–1963), then he had it changed to &quot;Professor of Human Genetics&quot; (1963–1965). According to his successor, Professor Harry Harris, Penrose &quot;never liked the name &#x27;eugenics&#x27;, because it seemed to him to be too much associated with uninformed and dangerous policies of racial purification.&quot; Harris also reported the &quot;long delay&quot; in changing this name was due to &quot;legal problems&quot; associated with the original donation from Francis Galton and described how Penrose simply ignored the &quot;eugenics&quot; element of his job title.

&quot;Penrose&#x27;s Law&quot; states that the population size of prisons and psychiatric hospitals are inversely related, although this is generally viewed as something of an oversimplification.

Penrose, a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers), was a lead figure in the Medical Association for the Prevention of War in the 1950s.

Penrose developed the Penrose method, a method for apportioning seats in a global assembly based on the square root of each nation&#x27;s population. Such a voting system is based on the voting power of any voter (measured by the Penrose–Banzhaf index) decreasing with the size of the voting body as one over its square root. See also Penrose square root law.

Penrose was particularly interested in different facets of biology, for example fingerprints, demography, and cytogenetics, which were a result of his research into the etiology of intellectual disability, especially Down syndrome. He did intensive research on the latter, communicating the results of his investigations in 1963 and winning the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation Award for his contributions to the understanding of the causes of intellectual disability.

==Awards and honours==
Penrose received a number of awards and honours including the 1960 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. The Lasker citation read:

Penrose was awarded the James Spence Gold Medal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in 1964 for major contributions in human genetics and extensive research into Down syndrome and Intellectual disability.&quot;

==Family==
Lionel Penrose&#x27;s father was James Doyle Penrose. His mother, Elisabeth Josephine, was daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his brother was Sir Roland Penrose, both British artists. He married Margaret Leathes in 1928 and they had four children:

* Oliver Penrose, born 1929, physicist;
* Sir Roger Penrose, born 1931, mathematical physicist and mathematician (with whom Lionel co-authored papers on the Penrose triangle); and who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics;
* Jonathan Penrose, (1933–2021), chess grandmaster and psychologist;
* Shirley Hodgson, born 1945, geneticist.

After Penrose&#x27;s death, Margaret married the mathematician Max Newman (1897–1984). She died in 1989.

<text>Dreams of Sanity was a gothic metal band from Austria. Founded in 1991, they released three full-length albums, before disbanding in 2002.

==History==
After forming in 1991, Dreams of Sanity released two demos in 1994 and 1996. They toured Europe late in 1996 before releasing their proper debut in 1997, which was inspired by The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri. Two further full-lengths were issued by the band, the first based upon &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and the second exploring the concept of life as a game. The group went through a series of lineup changes around the recording of the third album. Following this they were dropped by their label Hall of Sermon; the group broke up in 2002.

The band&#x27;s founding members are Dane Brown on drums, his brother Jason Brown on vocals, Luke McDonald on guitar and Sean Van Gennip on bass guitar. Sunk Loto signed a recording contract with Sony Music Australia when the members&#x27; average age was 16 years. They released two studio albums, &quot;Big Picture Lies&quot; (13 October 2000) and &quot;Between Birth and Death&quot; (17 November 2003); both reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 50. Sunk Loto toured internationally between 1997 and 2007 headlining their own shows, appearing at major festivals such as The Big Day Out and Livid, and playing alongside international bands such as Sevendust, Korn and Deftones.
The group disbanded in December 2007, and after a 15-year hiatus the original members re-formed the band in 2022 and have since performed around Australia with 2 sold out national tours, and released their first new song in 20 years “The Gallows Wait” with new guitarist Rohan Stevenson after announcing they had parted ways with Luke McDonald.
The band have announced they intend to release new music and continue touring. 

== History ==
===1997–1999: Formation and &quot;Society Anxiety&quot;===

Sunk Loto formed as a heavy metal band, Messiah, in the Gold Coast, Queensland in March 1997 by Dane Brown on drums, his brother Jason Brown on lead vocals, Luke McDonald on guitar and Miles Matheson on bass guitar. Originally named Messiah, Jason Brown had met Luke McDonald at a local music store, Jason brought his younger brother Dane to practice sessions and McDonald&#x27;s school mate, Sean Van Gennip joined the band when Miles decided to part ways. Sean Van Gennip completed the new line-up. A year later they changed their name due to a London band of that name: Jason explained &quot;we looked up Messiah in the dictionary and one of the meanings was &#x27;liberators of the oppressed&#x27; so we took the first letter of each word to form LOTO and SUNK from the sinking of the first name.&quot;

In April 1999 the group signed with Epic Records when Dane was 13 and the band&#x27;s oldest member, Van Gennip, was 17. In November that year, they released a five-track extended play, &quot;Society Anxiety&quot;, which was produced by Paul McKercher (the Cruel Sea, Spiderbait). It peaked in the ARIA Singles Chart top 40 at number 40. Justin Donnelly of &quot;Blistering&quot; described their early sound &quot;it was predictable. There wasn&#x27;t much in the way of pushing the envelope song wise, and while the nu-metal angle is now a bit contrived, it was a sound that typified the time.&quot; The administrator of &quot;Beatdust&quot; felt it &quot;pays homage to its inspirations – elements of both &quot;Evil Empire&quot; era RATM and Deftones &quot;Around the Fur&quot; are heavily evident both musically and sonically throughout.&quot; The lead track, &quot;Vinegar Stroke&quot;, became a radio favourite. The band performed at a range of festivals including Homebake promoting the EP and then commenced writing their debut studio album.

=== 2000–2007: &quot;Big Picture Lies&quot; to &quot;Between Birth and Death&quot; ===

From 2000 to 2002 Adam Cox joined the band&#x27;s live roster as their DJ, sampler and keyboardist. Sunk Loto issued their debut album, &quot;Big Picture Lies&quot; (October 2000), with McKercher again as producer, in Sydney. The band travelled to New York studio RPM to have it mixed by Michael Barbiero (Guns n Roses). It peaked at No. 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. According to Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, they were &quot;never really happy with [the album]. They&#x27;d been rushed. They knew the songs could have been better if they&#x27;d had more time.&quot; It was dubbed, &quot;competent but disappointing&quot;, by &quot;Beatdust&quot;″s administrator. &quot;The Post&quot;″s Sam Bartlett observed, &quot;[it] is all over the shop, suggesting a promising future, while summing up the coagulation of influences from hip-hop, rock, metal and even classical.&quot;

Tim Cashmere of &quot;radioundercover.com&quot; felt it was &quot;good work&quot; and that unlike many contemporaries, the lead singer, &quot;Jason does have a fairly decent voice.&quot; However Cashmere was disappointed by the limited edition&#x27;s bonus CD-ROM, which was &quot;difficult to navigate, contentless, jerky horse poo.&quot; The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Make You Feel&quot; (August 2000), peaked at No. 33 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was followed in December by &quot;Sunken Eyes&quot;, which reached the top 100. Cashmere described the former as being reminiscent of Korn and praised Jason&#x27;s vocals on the latter. Sunk Loto joined the Big Day Out tour in 2001, and also toured extensively for the following two years.

Dom Alessio of &quot;Who the Hell&quot; noticed &quot;They were being pushed by their label to be the next Silverchair.&quot; The group decided to improve the standard of song writing for their next album. Besides taking time with their song writing they faced personal hardships including the death of a friend, drug addiction, divorce and their equipment being stolen. The group rejected a number of demos, Jason recalled, &quot;We&#x27;ve just been writing music pretty much and it just took us a while. We kept coming up with demos and they weren&#x27;t good enough. We just knew we could do better.&quot;

On 17 November 2003 they issued their second album, &quot;Between Birth and Death&quot;, a significantly darker and heavier effort with Phil McKellar (Grinspoon, Silverchair, Spiderbait) producing. It peaked at number 48 on the ARIA Albums Chart, No. 13 on the ARIA Australasian Artists and No. 4 on the ARIA Heavy Rock &amp; Metal chart. Its lead single, &quot;Everything Everyway&quot;, had appeared in October 2003, and reached the top 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, McKellar was nominated for ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year for his work on &quot;Between Birth and Death&quot;.

Alessio observed, &quot;the band were struggling with a falling popularity, as well as dealing with managers who were ripping them off. Then the SonyBMG merger resulted in Sunk being dropped from the label.&quot; In 2006 Sean Van Gennip departed the band due to creative differences and was replaced on bass guitar by Rob Kaay (ex-Full Scale). The band finished a short Australian tour at the end of that year and planned to record their third studio album. McDonald wanted to &quot;take their sound down an even darker path.&quot; Dane, Jason and Kaay decided in May 2007 to work on a new project without McDonald, due to irreparable creative and personal reasons. Sunk Loto played their final show at the Hard Rock Hotel, Gold Coast on 14 December 2007.

The Brown brothers and Kaay formed a new band, the Flood, which was short-lived. Some of their tracks appeared on Kaay&#x27;s Soundcloud page. Jason and Dane Brown later created Electric Horse with ex-members of fellow Gold Coast band, Lump. Electric Horse issued an EP, &quot;Translations&quot; (2010), and a studio album, &quot;Venomous&quot; (2013). McDonald was briefly a member of another Gold Coast group, Miacarla, before leaving the music industry.

=== 2022–present: Reformation ===

After 15 years of being on hiatus, the band&#x27;s founding members, Luke Mcdonald, Sean Van Gennip, Jason Brown &amp; Dane Brown decided to reform Sunk Loto in 2022. The band announced three shows in SE Queensland that immediately sold out and further touring was announced for later in 2022.

The band announced on 22 August 2023 that guitarist and co-founder Luke McDonald was no longer in the band.
On September 4, 2023, Rohan Stevenson of Melbourne instrumental band &#x27;I Built The Sky&#x27; was announced as McDonald&#x27;s replacement, taking up lead guitar duties as a fulltime member of the band. On 3rd of October 2023, the band officially released the track &quot;The Gallows Wait&quot;, their first new music in almost 20 years.

<doc id="696035" wikidata="Q1672366" url="?curid=696035" title="Iraqi Communist Party">
<text>The Iraqi Communist Party ( &quot;&quot;; ) is a communist party and the oldest active party in Iraq. Since its foundation in 1934, it has dominated the left in Iraqi politics. It played a prominent role in shaping the political history of Iraq between its foundation and the 1970s. The Party was involved in many of the most important national uprisings and demonstrations of the 1940s and 1950s. It suffered heavily under the Ba&#x27;ath Party and Saddam Hussein but remained an important element of the Iraqi opposition and was a vocal opponent of the United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War of 1991. It opposed the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003 but since then has participated in the new political institutions. It received little support in the Iraqi general elections of 2005. The party gained some seats in each province in which the 2013 Iraqi governorate elections were held. The party joined the newly established Sairoun Alliance in the 2018 parliamentary elections, who gained the highest number of votes and a total of 54 seats in the Iraqi parliament.

==History==
===Roots of the party, 1924–1929===
The history of Marxist ideology and organization in Iraq can be traced to a single individual, Husain al-Rahhal, a student at the Baghdad School of Law, who in 1924 formed what is now seen as the first &quot;Marxist&quot; study circle in Iraq. This group of young intellectuals initially began meeting in Baghdad&#x27;s Haidarkhanah Mosque (a location also famous as a meeting place for revolutionaries in 1920) and discussing &quot;new ideas&quot; of the day. They eventually formed a small newspaper, Al-Sahifah (&quot;The Journal&quot;), which detailed a decidedly Marxist ideology. Membership in this circle included such influential Iraqis as Mustafa Ali, Minister of Justice under Abd al-Karim Qasim, and Mahmoud Ahmad Al-Sayyid, considered Iraq&#x27;s first novelist. Al-Rahhal, an accomplished polyglot, was able to translate articles from various European Communist and Marxist newspapers, thus introducing many new ideals into Iraqi intellectual society. While the paper lacked a definite agenda or program, the majority of the writing was centered on the need to break down the strong influence of tradition in Iraqi society. This included equal rights for women and the abolition of feudal practices. After six issues and several government crackdowns, the paper published its final issue in 1927 and was permanently shut down. From this point on Al-Rahhal exerted his influence only from the background, most notably through the youth organization Nadi Al-Tadamun (&quot;The Solidarity Club&quot;). Through this organization he helped to inspire Iraq&#x27;s first student demonstrations on 30 January 1927 (over the firing of certain controversial teachers) and 8 February 1928 (over the visit of prominent British Zionist Alfred Mond to Iraq).

===1930s===
In 1929, a sharp decline in international commodity prices caused a more than 40 percent drop in the value of Iraqi exports. This led to a national economic depression and massive wage reductions for many of Iraq&#x27;s workers. It was at this time that Communist circles began growing among young men in Basra (led by Ghali Zuwayyid) and Nasiriyyah (led by Yusuf Salman Yusuf, &quot;Comrade Fahd&quot;). Several circles were also growing in Baghdad, led by such notables as Asim Flayyeh, Mahdi Hashim, and . These young men had first met during the student demonstrations of 1927 and 1928. These groups were brought together through the boycott of the British-owned Baghdad Electric Light Company, lasting from 5 December 1933 until 2 January 1934. Finally, on 8 March 1935, Jamiyyat Dudd Al-Istimar (&quot;The Association Against Colonialism&quot;) was founded. Three days later a manifesto was issued, calling for the unification of all workers and peasants and demanding cancellation of debts, redistribution of lands, and extensions of worker&#x27;s rights, including an eight-hour day. The organization, with its founders acting as regional leaders, set about publishing Iraq&#x27;s first underground paper, Kifah Al-Shab (&quot;The Struggle of the People&quot;), and began attacking prime minister Yasin al-Hashimi, resulting in swift police crackdown and the arrests of almost all of the major leaders. By December 1935, the paper ceased to exist, having reached a circulation of about 500.

After the coup of 29 October 1936, the Iraqi Communist leaders and organizers who had eluded imprisonment helped to lead the wave of peaceful demonstrations occurring across the country, such as Ghali Zuwayyid in Basra. The party found supporters on the &quot;Committee for National and Progressive Reform&quot; (which organized popular support in Baghdad) and even secured two supporters in the newly elected parliament. Bakr Sidqi, the leader of the coup and now the new power in the government, quickly issued attacks on the party, and was met with labor strikes across the nation. Sidqi responded with further crackdowns, and many of the Communist reformers fled the cause. Despite the assassination of Sidqi in 1937, the damage had been done, leaving the leadership of the party in the hands of , who sought new support for the party among the lower ranks of the military throughout the late 1930s.

The Iraqi Communist Party stood firmly against anti-Semitism and was wary of fascist trends among right-wing parties.

===1940s===
World War II posed a difficult predicament for the ICP, who looked to the Soviet Union for guidance but also vehemently opposed supporting the British Empire, whose occupation of Iraq after the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War was partially premised on keeping supply lines open to the Soviets. After Nazi Germany launched an invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the ICP hesitated to officially lend their support to either side. While their ideological allies were the Soviet Union, the Soviets were allied with the British, and the Germans also had significant influence in Iraq during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The party eventually decided to support the Allies in May 1942, which essentially aligned them with the Iraqi monarchy and the landowners for the time being.

In 1941, Yusuf Salman Yusuf became secretary general of the party, and set about revamping the organization and expanding membership among the working classes. He successfully laid the basis for the mass party of later years, and under his leadership the party became a considerable force among the Iraqi working class and a major focus for protest against British involvement in Iraqi affairs. In 1942 some of his decisions fell under criticism, and eventually split the party into several factions, each with their own newspaper. In 1944 the party launched a clandestine campaign to organize the nation&#x27;s industrial workers, spearheaded by lower middle class intellectuals. This led to a party conference in March 1944 and eventually to the party&#x27;s first congress in 1945, at which the dissidents of 1942 were reinstated into the party ranks.

Anti-British sentiment came back into the forefront of party concerns in April 1945, as the cost of living in the country grew higher and higher. The party attacked the Iraqi government with criticisms and outright condemnations after the killing of protestors in June and July 1946, and as a result Fahd was arrested and sentenced to death, later reduced to life in prison. Between 1944 and 1946, major percentages (30-60%) of oil and railway workers, along with port workers in Basra, were unionized, all with ICP members as union leaders. As a result, massive strikes were organized between 1945 and 1947, demanding wage increases and the legalization of union organizations. The government initially granted wage increases, but soon dismantled the unions and arrested their leaders, contributing to Al-Wathbah, a period of urban unrest in Baghdad, beginning in January 1948. Another major issue for the party at this time was the Palestinian Question. Despite earlier support of Palestinian rights of self-determination, in July 1948 the party fell in line with Moscow&#x27;s position of supporting a Zionist state. The party lost many supporters among the public because of this, and many members also resigned and left the party ranks in anger.

While this period brought many organizational victories for the party, it also brought devastating response from the government, due to the party&#x27;s role in the al-Wathbah uprisings. Fahd and two fellow ICP members were publicly hanged in 1949, after being accused of organizing agitation from prison. The party was nearly decimated, and a period of reconstruction was to follow.

===1950–1958===
After the devastations of the late 40s, the composition of the party went through some serious changes. The severely weakened organization was carried through the early 50s by growing Kurdish support and for the period 1949-1950 the party was actually led from Kurdistan instead of Baghdad. Nearly the entirety of the old, largely Baghdadi leadership had been imprisoned, including communist leaders like Krikor Badrossian, and the Kurdish members quickly filled the resulting void. This period also saw a drastic drop in Jewish membership, undoubtedly connected to Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, the massive exodus of approximately 120,000 Jews from Iraq at this time. Between 1952 and 1954 a series of uprisings led to the establishment of martial law, the outlawing of all political parties, cultural circles, unions, and independent media, and the arrests of their leaders. This policy was instituted during one of Nuri al-Said&#x27;s many periods of control over the government. The ICP, which had always been an illegal organization, adopted a new national charter in 1953 which differed from the 1944 charter in that it accepted possible secession of the Kurdish people. At this time, according to one source, the party numbered about 500. Riots over prison conditions broke out in June and September 1953, first in Baghdad and then in Kut, resulting in the deaths of many Communist political prisoners at the hands of the police. This caused a national outcry and won many sympathizers to the side of the Communist cause. At the second party Congress in 1956, the party officially adopted a pan-Arabist stance. This was inspired not only by the arms agreement between Egypt and the USSR in July 1955, but also by Egypt&#x27;s nationalization of the Suez Canal the following year, resulting in an Anglo-French-Israeli attack on Egypt. This pro-Nasserist stance would eventually become a point of conflict after the 1958 revolution. In 1958, the party supported the revolution and the new government of Abd al-Karim Qasim, who relied to a considerable degree on its support.

===The party under Qasim, 1958–1963===

The relationship between the party and Abd al-Karim Qasim was positive. After the monarchy was overthrown, ICP&#x27;s Naziha al-Dulaimi was picked by Qasim as Minister of Municipalities in the 1959 cabinet as the sole representative of the ICP in his republican government. She was the first woman minister in Iraq&#x27;s modern history and the first woman cabinet minister in the Arab world. Qasim was supported in his investiture as Prime Minister in part by the Communist Party (who he had earlier lifted a ban on), giving several ranks to them and establishing slightly improved relations with the Soviet Union.

===The party under Ba&#x27;athist rule===
The Ba&#x27;athist coup of 8 February 1963 was accompanied by street fighting as Communist activists and supporters resisted the coup attempt. Fighting in Baghdad continued for three days, concentrated in the party&#x27;s strongholds. When the Baath consolidated its power the ICP suffered an unprecedented campaign of suppression. Leading figures and cadres of the Party killed, including Husain al-Radi. The total number of communists killed is unknown, but was certainly in the dozens.

In the mid-1960s, the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 15,000 (0.47% of the working age population of the country).

In 1967, Aziz al-Hajj split from the ICP, establishing the Iraqi Communist Party-Central Command, and initiated an armed struggle, which the ICP at the time opposed.

In 1973, ICP secretary Aziz Muhammad signed a National Action Pact with Iraqi President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, forming a National Progressive Front together with the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The ICP was permitted to operate legally, publish and revive its flanking organisations. Alexei Kosygin&#x27;s visit forced the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP) to improve its relations with the Ba&#x27;ath Party; two ICP members were given cabinet positions and repression of the ICP ended. However, this was coupled with elements of repression, and by the autumn of 1974 the party tried to increase its security through a more clandestine mode of operation. In 1978 Saddam Hussein unleashed a renewed campaign of repression against the party, including the execution of large numbers of party members. In 1979, the party broke ties with the Iraqi government.

In 1993, the Kurdish branch of the party was transformed into a semi-autonomous party, the Communist Party of Kurdistan – Iraq.

===After the American occupation of Iraq===
The Iraqi Communist Party opposed the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 but decided to work with the new political institutions established after the occupation. Its secretary, Hamid Majid Mousa, accepted a position on the Iraqi Governing Council. The party was the principal component of the People&#x27;s Union (Iraq) list for the general election on 30 January 2005 (see January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election) but filed separate lists in some governorate council elections (see for instance 2005 Ninawa governorate council election). For the December 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election, the party has joined the Iraqi National List of Ayad Allawi, along with other socialist, secular, moderate Sunni and moderate Shiite parties.

For the 2018 general election, the Communist Party would be in the Alliance Towards Reforms, which made significant gains. A communist woman representing the alliance, Suhad al-Khateeb, was also elected in the elections to represent the city of Najaf, deemed to be one of the holiest religious and conservative cities in Iraq. Al-Khateeb, who is a teacher and an anti-poverty and women&#x27;s rights activist, said upon her victory &quot;the Communist party have a long history of honesty – we were not agents for foreign occupations. We want social justice, citizenship, and are against sectarianism, and this is also what Iraqis want.&quot;

===2019–present===
The party was supportive of the 2019-2021 Iraqi protests and boycotted the 2021 Iraqi parliamentary elections, stating:

==Party institution and symbols==

The party newspaper is &quot;Tariq ash-Shaab&quot; (Path of the People). It also publishes the magazine &quot;Al-Thakafa Al-Jedida&quot; (The New Culture). The youth wing of the party is the Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation. The motto of the party is &quot;a free homeland and a happy people&quot; ( &quot;watanun hurrun wa sha&#x27;bun sa&#x27;id&quot;).

==Leadership list==
The following is a list of persons who served as Secretary or First Secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, the party&#x27;s primary leadership position. Given the occasional suppression of the party and resultant lapses in its activity, the position was at times vacant.

<doc id="696041" wikidata="Q1399752" url="?curid=696041" title="Silvino Francisco">
<text>Silvino Francisco (3 May 1946 – 14 December 2024) was a South African professional snooker player who won the 1985 British Open.

==Snooker career==
Francisco came from a snooker-playing family. His brother Manuel and nephew Peter both played at a high level, Manuel having been a runner-up in the World Amateur Billiards Championship on several occasions, and Peter having risen to the world ranking of number 14.

Francisco won the 1985 British Open, beating Kirk Stevens 12–9. Prior to the start of the Final match, Francisco accused Stevens of playing under the influence of drugs. Francisco was subsequently fined for the comments. The world governing body of snooker, the WPBSA, accepted that the accusation was false and it is on record that Kirk Stevens has never failed a drugs test in the history of his career. Stevens later admitted to having an addiction to cocaine.

He was involved in another scandal after the 1989 Masters. After losing 5–1 to Terry Griffiths in the last-16, it was discovered that there had been heavy betting on that exact score. Francisco was arrested, but later released without charge.

==Personal life and death==
Francisco suffered gambling problems towards the end of his professional career, to the extent of being declared bankrupt in 1996 due to income tax arrears. 

In 1997, he was arrested for smuggling cannabis, and served three years in prison.

Silvino remarried June Francisco in the early 2000s. In his later years he dedicated himself to his family, specifically his grandchildren Enola and Osiris, charity work and the snooker youth.

Francisco died on 14 December 2024, at the age of 78.

He remains the only African snooker player to have won a professional snooker ranking event.

<doc id="696043" wikidata="Q931440" url="?curid=696043" title="Don Drummond">
<text>Don Drummond (12 March 1934 – 6 May 1969) was a Jamaican ska trombonist and composer. He was one of the original members of The Skatalites, and composed many of their tunes. In 1966, Drummond was convicted of murdering his 23-year-old lover, Anita &quot;Marguerita&quot; Mahfood.

==Biography==
Drummond was born at the Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, to Doris Monroe and Uriah Drummond. He was educated at Kingston&#x27;s Alpha Boys School, where he later tutored his younger schoolmate Rico Rodriguez playing the trombone.

His musical career began in 1950 with the Eric Dean&#x27;s All-Stars where he performed jazz. He continued playing with big bands into the 1960s at clubs such as the Big Bucket and the Silver Slipper.

After performing jazz for a decade, Drummond began performing ska and in 1964 he joined The Skatalites. With Drummond&#x27;s politicized conversion to the Rastafari movement, other band members followed his lead. He became a household name in Jamaica, before suffering mental health problems. It has been said that pianist George Shearing rated him as being among the world&#x27;s top five trombone players.

On 2 January 1965, Drummond&#x27;s live-in lover, Anita &quot;Marguerita&quot; Mahfood, was found dead with four stab wounds to the chest. Drummond reported to the police that Mahfood had stabbed herself, but, in 1966, he was found guilty of her murder. Drummond was ruled criminally insane and imprisoned at Bellevue Asylum, Kingston, where he remained until his death four years later. The official cause of death was &quot;natural causes&quot;, possibly heart failure caused by malnutrition or improper medication, but other theories were put forward; some of his colleagues believed it was a government plot against the Kingston musical scene, and some believed that he was killed by gangsters as revenge for the murder of Mahfood. Heather Augustyn, author of a biography of Drummond published in 2013 claimed to have proved that Drummond&#x27;s death was caused by his medications.

==Legacy==
Although he never performed abroad, Drummond is considered one of Jamaica&#x27;s all-time great musicians.

In 2013, a ballet telling the story of Drummond&#x27;s life was performed by the National Dance Theatre Company of Jamaica. Created by Clive Thompson, the ballet is titled &quot;Malungu&quot;, which was Mahfood&#x27;s pet name for Drummond.

In 2013 a comprehensive biography of Don Drummond was published by McFarland Publishing. &quot;Don Drummond: The Genius and Tragedy of the World&#x27;s Greatest Trombonist&quot; by Heather Augustyn features a foreword by Delfeayo Marsalis.

<doc id="696046" wikidata="Q3137616" url="?curid=696046" title="1986–87 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons.

Steve Davis retained first place in the rankings, with a lead described by the snooker historian Clive Everton as a &quot;massive margin of 18 points&quot;. Also retaining his position, in second, was Cliff Thorburn, while Dennis Taylor overtook Tony Knowles for third place. The 1986 world champion Joe Johnson rose from 16th to 8th, and six-time world champion Ray Reardon fell from 6th to 15th.

Liam Kelly of the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; commented that although the WPBSA&#x27;s ranking system was intended to be fair, it was &quot;cumbersome and complicated&quot;. He noted that WPBSA chairman Rex Williams was ranked 16th instead of John Parrott, who had the same number of ranking points as Williams but more merit points, and argued that this &quot;called into question [the] entire system.&quot; Players in the top 16 of the rankings were seeded into the last-32 round of the 1987 World Snooker Championship, and received invitations to the 1987 Masters; in the 1985–86 snooker season the top 16 players were guaranteed at least £11,773.50 in prize money, while players ranked 17th to 32nd were only guaranteed to earn £4,570.50. Williams had been ranked 27th the previous season. Neal Foulds, ranked in the top 16 for the first time for 1986–87, moved up to 13th from 23rd place. The two players who lost their places in the top 16 were Eddie Charlton, who dropped from 12th to 25th, and David Taylor who went from 14th to 21st.

The highest-ranked of the players who had been competing professionally for only one season were Barry West (30th), Tony Drago (37th) and Stephen Hendry (51st). Among the players who changed their ranking significantly from the previous year were Peter Francisco (59th to 26th), Steve Duggan (70th to 35th), and Roger Bales (100th to 66th).

== Points tariff and basis of ranking==
Ranking was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points;
*If players had an equal number of ranking points, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the 1985–86 season;
*If players were still equal, merit points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the 1985–86 season;
*If players were still equal, A points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better in the 1985–86 season;
*If players were still equal, frames won were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given the player with the better in the 1985–86 season.

<doc id="696049" wikidata="Q7067936" url="?curid=696049" title="Nuclear Disarmament Party">
<text>The Nuclear Disarmament Party (NDP) was an Australian political party formed in June 1984. It was founded by medical researcher Michael Denborough as the political arm of the Australian anti-nuclear movement, which had been active since the early 1970s.

The NDP primarily attracted left-wing Labor Party voters who were disillusioned with Bob Hawke&#x27;s pro-nuclear stance. At the 1984 federal election, the NDP polled 7.23 percent of the total Senate vote, electing Jo Vallentine as a senator for Western Australia. However, Vallentine resigned from the party before taking her seat, due to allegations of a takeover by Trotskyists affiliated with the Socialist Workers Party. The NDP&#x27;s vote collapsed to 1.1 percent at the 1987 election – a double dissolution. Robert Wood was elected as a senator for New South Wales, but after less than a year in office was disqualified by the Court of Disputed Returns and replaced by Irina Dunn. However, Dunn was expelled from the party after less than a month in office, and like Vallentine served out the rest of her term as an independent.

The NDP had no electoral success after 1987, and the 1990 election was the last at which the party ran a serious campaign. After several years of inactivity, the party was revived for the 1998 election. It attracted little support in its second manifestation, and was eventually formally disbanded in December 2009, when it voluntarily relinquished its registration with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). In the meantime, many of its initial members had either returned to the Labor Party or become involved with the Australian Greens.

==Foundation, the 1984 election, and the split==
The NDP was founded by Canberra doctor and peace activist Michael Denborough in response to the world political situation in the early 1980s, particularly the arms race between the United States under Ronald Reagan and the Soviet Union. Such activists were disappointed that the Australian Labor Party government of Bob Hawke, elected in 1983, had not taken a stronger stance against the policies of the U.S., and also that Hawke had overturned a long-standing ALP policy not to mine uranium, and had allowed mining in South Australia at Olympic Dam near Roxby Downs, which has since become one of the largest uranium mines in the world.

At the December 1984 federal election the NDP received 643,061 votes (7.23% of the total), and exceeded 4% in every state except Tasmania, where it received 3.9%. Amongst the NDP candidates were Peter Garrett, a rock singer, and Jean Melzer, a former Victorian ALP senator. Garrett polled 9.6% of the vote in NSW, and Melzer polled 7.3% in Victoria. Because of an adverse distribution of preferences (see Australian electoral system), neither Garrett nor Melzer was elected. However, Western Australian peace activist Jo Vallentine was elected to the Senate.

In April 1985, Vallentine, Garrett and Melzer, along with 30 other members, walked out of the national conference in Melbourne and resigned from the NDP, claiming that the party had been taken over by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a Trotskyist group. In the wake of the split, Vallentine became an independent &#x27;senator for nuclear disarmament&#x27; and went on to be re-elected as a ‘Vallentine Peace Group’ candidate in the double dissolution election of 1987.

==1985 Nunawading by-election==

Due to a tied vote in the Victorian upper house province of Nunawading, and having the winning vote drawn from a hat, a Labor government for the first time in its history had control of the Victorian Legislative Council. A fresh election was ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns. The Liberals won re-election and Labor lost its slim majority. Within a week of polling day Mr Martin Peake, Chairman of the Victorian Nuclear Disarmament Party, lodged an official complaint with the Chief Electoral Officer of Victoria, about a deceptive NDP how to vote card handed out at the booths. In essence, the Victorian ALP state secretary organised forged NDP how-to-vote cards and members of the Labor Party were recognised handing out this card and that the allocation of preferences to the ALP on the card damaged the NDP. The government entered a cover-up to protect its state secretary Peter Batchelor and the Labor party. As police investigated the case, the culprits blamed the Socialist Workers Party.

==1987 federal election and aftermath==
After this the NDP consisted of a group of activists led by Denborough. At the July 1987 federal election, the party&#x27;s Senate vote in New South Wales fell from 9.6% to 1.5%. However, after distribution of preferences from other minor parties, the NDP&#x27;s Robert Wood received more than the 7.7% quota, and hence was duly elected. In May 1988, however, Wood, who was born in the United Kingdom, was disqualified from membership of the Senate on the grounds that he had not been an Australian citizen at the time of nomination. Wood&#x27;s seat was won on a recount of the ballots by the second candidate on the NDP ticket in NSW, Irina Dunn.

When Wood was subsequently granted Australian citizenship he became eligible to be a member of parliament. The New South Wales Branch of the NDP asked Dunn to resign so they could seek to have Wood appointed to fill the casual vacancy. This might have allowed Wood to re-enter the Senate, but Dunn refused, citing various difficulties and risks with this scenario. The NDP state branch passed a vote of no confidence in her, and she resigned from the party on 22 August 1988, the day she was sworn in to the senate. Like Wood and Vallentine, Dunn described herself as a &quot;Senator for Nuclear Disarmament&quot; having already distanced herself from the NDP. She lost her Senate place at the 1990 election.

==Later years and demise==
At the 1990 election, the NDP only ran candidates in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory. Robert Wood was the lead candidate in New South Wales, and polled 1.04% of the statewide senate vote – more than Irina Dunn&#x27;s independent ticket, but not nearly enough to be elected. The NDP was voluntarily deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 23 April 1992. It was re-registered on 7 May 1998, and stood candidates at another four federal elections (1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007) before again being voluntarily deregistered in December 2009.

<text>Karen Morley (born Mildred Linton; December 12, 1909 – March 8, 2003) was an American film actress.

==Life and career==
Born Mildred Linton in Ottumwa, Iowa, Morley lived there until she was 13 years old. When she moved to Hollywood, she attended Hollywood High School. She went on to attend the University of California, but she dropped out to join the Los Angeles Civic Repertory Theatre and the Pasadena Playhouse.

After working at the Pasadena Playhouse, she came to the attention of the director Clarence Brown, at a time when he had been looking for an actress to stand in for Greta Garbo in screen tests. This led to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and roles in films such as &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1931), &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), &quot;The Phantom of Crestwood&quot; (1932), &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932), &quot;Arsene Lupin&quot; (1933), &quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; (1933), and &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933).

Her career came to an end in 1947 (November 1952) when she testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee and refused to answer questions about her alleged American Communist Party membership. She maintained her political activism for the rest of her life. In 1954, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of New York on the American Labor Party ticket.

In December 1999, at the age of 90, she appeared in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in an article about blacklist survivors, and she was honored at the San Francisco Film Festival.

==Personal life==
In November 1932, Morley married director Charles Vidor in Santa Ana, California. They were divorced on March 2, 1943. Vidor and Morley had a son.

==Death==
Morley lived in Santa Monica, California at the now demolished retirement facility the Beautiful Montana Gardens during her later years. She died of pneumonia at the age of 93 in Woodland Hills, California.

<text>Area-7 (also known as Area 7) are an Australian ska punk band. Formed in Melbourne in 1994, they have released four studio albums, &quot;No Logic!&quot;, &quot;Bitter &amp; Twisted&quot;, &quot;Say It To My Face&quot; and &quot;Torn Apart&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, &quot;Bitter &amp; Twisted&quot; was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Rock Album in the World.

== History ==
Area-7 was formed in 1994 by members of Madness cover band Mad Not Madness. In 1994 four members, Ivan Downey, Dugald &quot;Doogs&quot; McNaughtan (keyboards), Charles &quot;Chucky T&quot; Thompson (guitar) and Dan Morrison (drums) left the group and began to write their own songs. In 1994, Area-7 self-released a cassette titled &quot;Demo Tape 1994&quot; featuring 4 tracks. Alistair Shepherd (sax), Toby Dargaville (trumpet) and Rohan Pacey (bass) joined in 1995 and the same year released their debut studio album &quot;No Logic&quot;. 

In 2000, the group released &quot;Bitter &amp; Twisted&quot;, which at the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Rock Album.

In October 2001, the group released &quot;Say It to My Face&quot; which peaked at number 36 on the ARIA charts.

Whilst AREA-7 has never &quot;officially split&quot;, since 2005 the band has been playing &quot;when they feel like it&quot; or as they put it, &quot;for special occasions&quot;. 

Drummer and founding member Dan Morrison died on 1 December 2020.

<text>Flagstaff railway station is a commuter railway station on the Burnley, Caulfield, Clifton Hill and Northern group lines, serving the Melbourne CBD in Victoria, Australia. Flagstaff is an underground premium station on the City Loop, featuring four platforms, two island platforms on two floors connected to street level via an underground concourses. It opened on 27 May 1985.

The station takes its name from the nearby Flagstaff Hill, a significant site in Melbourne&#x27;s early colonial history, and serves Melbourne&#x27;s legal district. It is located under La Trobe and William streets, near the north-western corner of the CBD.

== History ==

The station was constructed by mining methods, and has four levels to a maximum depth of . The site was a geological &quot;sandwich&quot; of basalt in the arch area, Silurian mudstone bedrock in the lower half, and silt in the middle, which precluded the construction of lower and upper platforms as separately driven tunnels.

Instead, the station platforms consist of two chambers linked by cross tunnels, each having two platforms on top of each other. The side of each chamber was made up of two drift tunnels, one at the top and one at the bottom. They were then linked by 228 vertically raise bored shafts, in diameter and apart. The shafts and drifts were then filled with concrete, and formed the side skeleton of the station chambers. The arch of each chamber was then constructed across the top of the two side walls, the material below the arch being excavated down to the bottom of the side walls, with temporary cross struts added between the raise bored columns, until the permanent elements were added. That innovative method resulted in a $1 million saving in construction costs.

Flagstaff was the last station to open on the City Loop. Although trains had run through the station site since 24 January 1981, when the Loop began operating, Flagstaff did not open to passengers until 27 May 1985. 

Initially, the City Loop did not operate at all on Sundays. That was changed with the introduction of Sunday trading but, at the same time that the other two underground loop stations opened on Sundays, Flagstaff station had its Saturday services cancelled. That was due to its proximity to business-related buildings such as the Commonwealth Law Complex, banks and major office buildings, which were usually closed on weekends and public holidays. After a number of residential developments had been built in the area, the station was scheduled to open on weekends from June 2015 with both the Labor and Liberal political parties having committed to that in the 2014 Victorian state election. However, that was deferred until 1 January 2016 when it permanently opened to services on both Saturdays and Sundays.

In May 2017, CDC Melbourne operated bus route 605 to Gardenvale from Flagstaff Station.

As of 2023-24, Flagstaff is the seventh-busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 3.435 million passengers. 

== Facilities ==
The station is located under the intersection of La Trobe and William streets and has two entrances – via lift or escalator south of La Trobe Street, and by stairs on the north. Flagstaff has three underground levels. The concourse level has a ticket office, ticket-operated gates, toilets, a news stand and a hot snack shop. Flagstaff&#x27;s four platforms are on the two levels below, with each level having an island platform. The levels are linked by elevators, 14 escalators and stairs. The four platforms serve a separate group of rail lines that leave the loop and radiate out into the city&#x27;s suburbs.

== Usage ==

Flagstaff is the seventh-busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan rail network.

<doc id="696063" wikidata="Q2656199" url="?curid=696063" title="1987–88 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons, and the rankings for 1987–88 were also based on results from the preceding two seasons. The snooker journalist Janice Hale wrote positively about the rankings being calculated across two seasons rather than three. She argued that, at a time when snooker was the most viewed televised sport in the UK, &quot;New faces are now beginning to appear on television&quot;.

Steve Davis retained the top ranking for the fifth consecutive year, with Jimmy White second and Neal Foulds third. White, who won two ranking titles in the 1986–87 season, had been in fifth place the previous year, and Foulds, who won one ranking title in the latter season, moved up from 13th.

Discussing the rankings for 1987–88, the snooker journalist Terry Smith asserted that &quot;Every player in the lower ranks has one immediate aima place in the top 16... that elite top group.&quot; Players in the top 16 were seeded into the last-32 round of the 1988 World Snooker Championship and received invitations to the 1988 Masters. John Parrott, Mike Hallett and Dean Reynolds moved into the top 16 for the first time, while Kirk Stevens, Tony Meo and Ray Reardon fell out of it. Six-time world champion Reardon dropped down to 38th from 15th. Teenager Stephen Hendry rose to 23rd from 51st. Ken Owers was the highest-ranked of the players who had joined the circuit in the 1986–87 season.

In the original list for the season, Perrie Mans was listed at 50th and George Ganim at 126th. There were 130 professionals listed, of which those ranked 121 or lower became &quot;non-tournament&quot; (NT) players, meaning that they were permitted to enter the world championship but no other tournaments. Mans resigned his membership of the WPBSA that year. The list as published in the &quot;Benson and Hedges Snooker Yearbook&quot; in 1987 omits Mans and Ganim, and has David Greaves above François Ellis; these differences are reflected in the table used below.

== Points tariff and basis of ranking==
Ranking was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points.
*If players had an equal number of ranking points, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, merit points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, A points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better in the later season.
*If players were still equal, frames won were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given the player with the better in the later season.

==Rankings==
&quot;(NT)&quot; denotes a &quot;non-tournament&quot; player, i.e. a player who was permitted to enter the world championship but no other tournaments in 1987–88. &quot;(New)&quot; denotes a player that was a new professional for 1986–87.

<text>Ted Knight (born Tadeusz Wladyslaw Konopka; December 7, 1923August 26, 1986) was an American actor known for playing the comedic roles of Ted Baxter in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, Henry Rush in &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot; and Judge Elihu Smails in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;.

== Early life ==
Knight was born in the Terryville section of Plymouth in Litchfield County, Connecticut to Polish-American parents Sophia (née Kavaleski) and Charles Walter Konopka, a bartender. He withdrew from high school to enlist in the United States Army during World War II and was a member of Company A, 296th Combat Engineer Battalion, earning five campaign stars while serving in the European Theater of Operations.

== Career ==
===Early roles===
During the postwar years, Knight studied acting in Hartford, Connecticut. He became proficient with puppets and ventriloquism, which led to steady work as a television children&#x27;s show host at WJAR-TV in Providence, Rhode Island from 1950 to 1955. In 1955, he left Providence for Albany, New York, where he landed a job at station WROW-TV (now WTEN), hosting &quot;The Early Show,&quot; featuring MGM movies, and a children&#x27;s variety show, playing a Gabby Hayes-type character named Windy Knight&quot;. He was also a radio announcer for sister station WROW radio and briefly for WFNS in Burlington, North Carolina. He left the station in 1957 after receiving advice from station manager (and future Capital Cities chairman) Thomas Murphy that he should take his talents to Hollywood.
Knight spent most of the 1950s and 1960s creating commercial voiceovers and playing minor television and film roles. He had a small part playing a police officer guarding the room where Norman Bates sat wrapped in a blanket at the end of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). He played Phil Buckley on the ABC soap opera &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot; in the early 1960s. He also made guest appearances in numerous series, including &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (in the episode &quot;The Lonely&quot;), &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Man and the Challenge&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot;, &quot;Manhunt&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;, &quot;The New Loretta Young Show&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (in the episode &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot;), &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot;, &quot;Judd, for the Defense&quot;, &quot;Garrison&#x27;s Gorillas&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;The Immortal&quot;.

Knight&#x27;s speaking voice also brought him work as a voice artist for various animated series produced by Filmation and Hanna-Barbera, including &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot; The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;Super Friends&quot; and &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Rescue Rangers&quot;.

=== &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; ===

Knight&#x27;s role as the vain and untalented WJM newscaster Ted Baxter on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; brought widespread recognition and his greatest success. He received six Emmy Award nominations for the role, winning the Emmy for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in Comedy in 1973 and 1976.

=== Post-&quot;MTM&quot; appearances ===
In 1975, Knight recorded an album of mostly novelty songs, &quot;Hi Guys&quot;, on the Ranwood label. The title track, in which Knight tries to extract himself from various embarrassing situations by using his signature &quot;Hi, guys!&quot; line, received some play on the Dr. Demento show.

Knight was the special guest star on the first episode of &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot; in September 1975. Vinton highlighted Knight&#x27;s Polish heritage and the two sang a duet of Vinton&#x27;s hit &quot;My Melody of Love&quot; in Polish. Knight was also featured in a production number based on one of the songs from the &quot;Hi Guys&quot; album, &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with Barbara Walters&quot;.

Knight used a variation of the Ted Baxter character for regional commercials. In the Cleveland area during the early to late 1970s, a newsman simply known as &quot;Ted&quot; would provide news of the events at a local shopping center known as Southgate USA, often finishing the 60-second spot with a comedic flair, including wearing a jacket that resembled Baxter&#x27;s blue WJM blazer. Knight also returned to Albany to film promo spots for his former employer WTEN.

Knight guest-starred in &quot;Mr. Dennis Steps Out&quot;, the October 26, 1977 episode of the situation comedy &quot;Busting Loose&quot;, as Roger Dennis, the owner of an escort service in New York City. This appearance launched a new show, &quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot;, Knight&#x27;s first starring role. &quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot; lasted for only six episodes in the spring of 1978.

Knight appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, including one episode as a rival cruise captain.

Knight&#x27;s final film role was in the 1980 golf comedy &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, in which he played Judge Elihu Smails, a foil for Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s character.

=== &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot; ===

Knight was cast in the lead role as the curmudgeonly cartoonist Henry Rush in the series &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot; in 1980. Throughout the series&#x27; run, Knight would wear sweatshirts from colleges and universities sent to him by students who were fans of the show. ABC canceled the show after three seasons, but it was revived in first-run syndication in 1984. In 1986, the show was retitled &quot;The Ted Knight Show&quot; and saw Henry retire from cartooning and become part-owner of a weekly newspaper. A second season was planned until Knight&#x27;s health became a factor.

== Personal life ==
In 1948, Knight married Dorothy Smith and the couple had three children: Ted Jr., Elyse and Eric.

In January 1985, Knight was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry. It is located at 6673 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Death ==
A few months after the end of the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in 1977, Knight was diagnosed with colon cancer, for which he received treatment. In 1985, the cancer returned and spread to his bladder and gastrointestinal tract.

Knight experienced complications from the surgery and was advised to not resume work on &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot; until he recovered. His condition worsened and he died on August 26, 1986 at age 62.

Knight was interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. His grave marker bears the name Theodore C. Konopka and the words &quot;Bye Guy&quot;, a reference to his Ted Baxter catchphrase &quot;Hi, guys!&quot;

His hometown of Terryville, Connecticut dedicated a bridge on Canal Street over the Pequabuck River in his memory. There is a bronze plaque bearing his likeness on the bridge.

<doc id="696082" wikidata="Q420477" url="?curid=696082" title="Jinshi">
<text>Jinshi () was the highest and final degree in the imperial examination in Imperial China. The examination was usually taken in the imperial capital in the palace, and was also called the Metropolitan Exam. Recipients are sometimes referred to in English-language sources as Imperial Scholars.

The &quot;jinshi&quot; degree was first created after the institutionalization of the civil service exam. Initially it had been &quot;for six categories&quot; but was later consolidated into a single degree. The examination system first appeared during the Han dynasty, but the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree first appeared under the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. During the Tang dynasty, every year around one to two percent of test takers would obtain a &quot;jinshi&quot; title out of a total of one to two thousand test takers.

The numbers of &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees given out were increased in the Song dynasty, and the examinations were given every three years. Most senior officials of the Song dynasty were &quot;jinshi&quot; holders.

The Ming dynasty resumed the civil-service exam after its occurrence became more irregular in the Yuan dynasty. After the reign of the Emperor Yingzong of Ming, it became the rule that only jinshi holders could enter the Hanlin Academy. On average around 89 &quot;jinshi&quot; per year were conferred.

During the Qing dynasty around 102 &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees were given a year.

The highest scoring &quot;jinshi&quot; in the country was known as the &quot;zhuangyuan&quot;, a term that survives today as a high scoring &quot;gaokao&quot; test taker or just someone who is very good at a skill.

==Subtypes of &quot;jinshi&quot; recipients==
* Jinshi Jidi (, lit. &quot;distinguished &quot;jinshi&quot;&quot;), graduates ranked first class in the court exam, usually only the top three individuals were qualified for this title.
** Zhuangyuan (, lit. &quot;top thesis author&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; who ranked first overall nationwide.
** Bangyan (, lit. &quot;eyes positioned alongside&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; who ranked second overall just below &quot;zhuangyuan&quot;.
** Tanhua (, lit. &quot;flower snatcher&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; ranked third overall.
* Jinshi Chushen (, lit. &quot;&quot;jinshi&quot; background&quot;), the graduates who ranked second class in court exam, ranking immediately after the &quot;tanhua&quot;.
* Tong Jinshi Chushen (, lit. &quot;along with &quot;jinshi&quot; background&quot;), graduates ranked third class in the court exam.

<doc id="696094" wikidata="Q436686" url="?curid=696094" title="Eric McCormack">
<text>Eric James McCormack (born April 18, 1963) is a Canadian and American actor known for his roles as Will Truman in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, Grant MacLaren in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Travelers&quot;, and Dr. Daniel Pierce in the TNT crime drama &quot;Perception&quot;. Born in Toronto, McCormack started acting by performing in high school plays. He left Ryerson University in 1985 to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, where he spent five years performing in many stage productions.

During the late 1990s he lived in Los Angeles and had minor roles. He made his feature film debut in the 1992 science-fiction adventure film &quot;The Lost World&quot;. McCormack appeared in several television series including &quot;Top Cops&quot;, &quot;Street Justice&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Dove: The Series&quot;, &quot;Townies&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. He later gained worldwide recognition for playing Will Truman in &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, which premiered in September 1998. His performance has earned him six Golden Globe nominations and four Emmy nominations, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2001.

Aside from appearing in television, he made his Broadway debut in the 2001 production of &quot;The Music Man&quot; and starred in the 2005 film &quot;The Sisters&quot;. Following the series conclusion of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; in 2006, McCormack starred as the leading role in the New York production of &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot;. He starred in the television miniseries &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (2008) and returned to television in 2009 in the TNT drama &quot;Trust Me&quot;, which was cancelled after one season. 

Also in 2009, McCormack was cast in the science-fiction movie &quot;Alien Trespass&quot;. In addition, he starred as Dr. Daniel Pierce for three seasons of the TNT crime drama &quot;Perception&quot;, and provided the voice of &quot;Lucky&quot; on The Hub&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;. From 2009 to 2010 he starred as Dr. Max Kershaw, the psychiatrist turned boyfriend of Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27; title character in &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;. In 2021, McCormack joined the cast of &quot;Departure&quot;. In 2023, he performed on Broadway in &quot;The Cottage&quot;.

==Early life==
McCormack was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Doris (1932–2006), a homemaker, and James &quot;Keith&quot; McCormack, an oil company financial analyst who died from cancer in 2008. He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. While he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports but was involved in theatre from an early age: &quot;I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through.&quot; He later attended Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario, where he was a classmate of David Furnish. He enrolled in theatre classes there and performed in high school productions of &quot;Godspell&quot; and &quot;Pippin&quot;. McCormack recalls that after performing in &quot;Godspell&quot;, his feelings toward becoming an actor solidified and he decided to pursue a career in acting. &quot;I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I&#x27;m lucky that way.&quot;

McCormack graduated from high school in 1982 and enrolled at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further develop as an actor. He left Ryerson in 1985, several months before graduating, to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario where he spent five seasons performing. &quot;It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor for the rest of my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn&#x27;t for me. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact.&quot; He appeared in productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. He later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of &quot;Burn This&quot;, as well as with Toronto&#x27;s Royal Alexandra Theatre in &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;.

==Career==

===Early work===
McCormack made his Canadian television debut in the 1986 movie &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;. McCormack moved to Los Angeles and made his US television debut in a 1991 episode of the CBS crime series &quot;Top Cops&quot;. He appeared in the 1992 theatrical films &quot;The Lost World&quot;, based on Conan Doyle&#x27;s novel of the same name and in its sequel, &quot;Return to the Lost World&quot;, also released in 1992. By 1993, he landed a recurring role as a detective in the crime drama &quot;Street Justice&quot;. Also in 1993, McCormack appeared in the television movie &quot;Double, Double, Toil and Trouble&quot;, playing Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen&#x27;s father.

He played the role of Colonel Francis Clay Mosby in 42 episodes of the Western television series &quot;Lonesome Dove: The Series&quot; (1994), which was later renamed &quot;Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years&quot; (1995). McCormack commented that it was a &quot;fantastic role&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, he admitted to auditioning &quot;two or three times&quot; for the part of Ross Geller for the situation comedy &quot;Friends&quot;, which ultimately went to David Schwimmer. In 1995, he appeared in the television film &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. He was cast in the 1997 made-for-television movie &quot;Borrowed Hearts&quot;, where he portrayed a selfish businessman who learns to love, and in the HBO film &quot;Exception to the Rule&quot;, in which he played a cheating husband.

Also in 1997, he had minor roles in the comedy shows &quot;Townies&quot;, &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Originally, McCormack was scheduled to appear as a series regular in the NBC sitcom &quot;Jenny&quot;, but was fired after the pilot due to the network cutting his character. In addition McCormack had a recurring role in season five of the comedy series &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;, in which he played a therapist and love interest for Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s character, Christine.

===&quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;===
McCormack received his breakthrough role in 1998 when he was cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. &quot;At the end of the audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said &#x27;That was perfect. Just to let you know, you never have to be more gay than that.&#x27;&quot; He explained that when he first read the script, &quot;what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He&#x27;s a great host, he&#x27;s relatively funny and he has great friends and he&#x27;s a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn&#x27;t really a big thing.&quot; The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6 million American viewers. &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will&#x27;s best friend Grace Adler) worked &quot;nicely&quot; together. Kay McFadden of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as &quot;very funny&quot;. For the performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.

Also in 1998, McCormack appeared in Stephen Herek&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Holy Man&quot;. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. The next year he starred in the comedy movie &quot;Free Enterprise&quot; (1999), a movie about two filmmakers (McCormack and Rafer Weigel) obsessed with actor William Shatner and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that McCormack and Weigel &quot;both make a strong impression&quot;. In 2000, McCormack appeared in the ABC television movie &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot;, portraying actor Mel Ferrer.

During the 2001 Broadway season, McCormack briefly portrayed Professor Harold Hill (replacing Craig Bierko) in the Susan Stroman revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot; at the Neil Simon Theatre. In August 2002, as part of the Hollywood Bowl&#x27;s summer concert series, he reprised the role of Harold Hill for a one-night only appearance in which he and other actors recreated the songs from the production. McCormack hosted the fourth episode of the 28th season of the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 2, 2002. In 2004, he had a recurring role as Ray Summers on Showtime&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;. The following year, McCormack starred in the film &quot;The Sisters&quot;, based on Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. The film premiered at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival.

&quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;&#x27;s eighth season ended with the series finale on May 18, 2006. The finale garnered 18 million American viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in six years. In January 2017, NBC closed a deal for a new, 10-episode season of Will &amp; Grace during the 2017–18 season. The new show has been branded as a &quot;reboot&quot;, or &quot;revival&quot;, taking place 11 years after the original series&#x27; finale episode, with McCormack reprising his role of Truman. In August 2017 it was extended again to 16 episodes, and a second 13-episode season was ordered. In March 2018, NBC ordered five more episodes for the revival&#x27;s second season, bringing the total to 18 episodes, and also renewed the show for an 18-episode third season. Eric McCormack continued his role of Will Truman for all of the announced seasons of the revival.

===After &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;===

After &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; ended McCormack starred on the New York stage opposite Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith, and Maura Tierney in Neil LaBute&#x27;s off-Broadway play &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot; at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. For his performance, McCormack received critical reviews. &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Ben Brantley, in review of the production, wrote: &quot;Playing a thoughtless, woman-despising heterosexual, Mr. McCormack isn&#x27;t much different from when he was playing a thoughtful, woman-worshiping homosexual. As in &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, he italicizes every other line for maximum comic spin and punctuates his dialogue by earnestly furrowing his features&quot;. Brantley went on to say that McCormack&#x27;s interpretation of the character is &quot;certainly a more slickly sustained performance&quot; than the one delivered by David Schwimmer in 2005. Melissa Rose Bernardo of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that McCormack and Tierney &quot;have incredible chemistry&quot;.

In the same year, McCormack produced the Lifetime comedy &quot;Lovespring International&quot;, a show that revolves around six employees at Lovespring International, a dating agency located in California as an &quot;elite Beverly Hills&quot; company. The series debuted to ambivalent reviews, with Matthew Gilbert of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commenting that &quot;Lovespring International&quot; is &quot;a lively little cable exercise in over-the-top characters, bad taste, satire, and political incorrectness.&quot; The show was cancelled that same year.
In 2008, McCormack co-starred in the A&amp;E television miniseries &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, a remake of the 1971 movie based on the novel by Michael Crichton. &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; received mixed reviews, and McCormack&#x27;s performance was criticized. Joanna Weiss of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;The presence of Eric McCormack, as an intrepid TV reporter, is especially extraneous (no disrespect to intrepid reporters).&quot; Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; commented, &quot;The central cast is completed by... poor Eric McCormack as a crusading, coke-addicted journalist who spends the second half of the movie playing Rambo in the desert. Let&#x27;s just say McCormack does the best he can with what he&#x27;s given, and leave it at that.&quot; On September 5, 2008, McCormack made a guest appearance in the seventh season and 100th episode of the television series &quot;Monk&quot;, where he played an unctuous host of a television crime docudrama.

In January 2009, McCormack returned to television in the TNT drama &quot;Trust Me&quot;, co-starring Tom Cavanagh. The series, set around a fictional advertising firm, starred McCormack as Mason McGuire who is the firm&#x27;s newly promoted creative director, and deals with his best friend&#x27;s (Cavanagh) unpredictable behavior. In an interview with &quot;USA Weekend&quot;, McCormack revealed he was not afraid of being typecast. His decision to do the show, he said, was due to &quot;great writing&quot;. The show debuted on January 26, 2009, and was watched by almost 3.4 million viewers. &quot;Trust Me&quot; debuted to very positive reviews, with Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; writing that &quot;the series is surprisingly solid.&quot; Mary McNamara of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that McCormack and Cavanagh &quot;manage to keep their characters sharply defined but low-key. They are opposites but not in an ash-smudged, Windex-wielding Felix and Oscar way.&quot; The series, however, was cancelled after one season due to poor ratings.

McCormack starred in the science-fiction film &quot;Alien Trespass&quot; (2009); he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth. When asked about his interpretation on the character, McCormack commented that his first instinct was to make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.
In May 2009, he portrayed &quot;El Gallo&quot; in Reprise Theatre Company&#x27;s revival of the 1960s musical &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; at UCLA&#x27;s Freud Playhouse. McCormack had a supporting role in Richard Loncraine&#x27;s comedy &quot;My One and Only&quot;, which was released in August 2009. On September 30, 2009, he guest-starred on the police procedural drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in the second episode of its 11th season playing an owner of a dating website.

McCormack portrayed con artist Clark Rockefeller in the Lifetime television movie &quot;Who Is Clark Rockefeller?&quot;, which premiered on March 13, 2010. Preparing for the role he read everything on the case, including coverage of the case and Rockefeller&#x27;s jailhouse interview. &quot;Who Is Clark Rockefeller?&quot; received mixed reaction, but McCormack&#x27;s performance was favored by critics, with &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Brian Lowry concluding that &quot;the real kitsch factor resides in Eric McCormack&#x27;s performance as the suave charmer, which adds an element of high camp to the proceedings.&quot;

In June 2010, McCormack received the NBC Universal Canada Award of Distinction at the Banff TV Festival. In October 2010, he received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In 2018, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry. In October 2010, it was reported that he would star in a new TNT television drama, &quot;Perception&quot;, playing a crime-solving neuroscientist named Dr. Daniel Pierce, who works with the federal government to solve cases using his knowledge and imaginative view of the world. &quot;Perception&quot; premiered on July 9, 2012. McCormack also serves as producer for the show. He also provides the voice of &quot;Lucky&quot; on The Hub&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot; series, which premiered October 10, 2010.

From March 6 through July 8, 2012, he played the role of Senator Joseph Cantwell in the Broadway revival of Gore Vidal’s &quot;The Best Man&quot;. In February 2015, he guest-starred on an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Laura&quot; which stars Debra Messing, his former co-star on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. He starred in &quot;Travelers&quot;, a science fiction drama which first aired in October 2016 and ran for three seasons.

In 2020, he narrated a portion of the 8th Canadian Screen Awards. In 2022, McCormack was cast in the fifth season of the Shudder horror series &quot;Slasher&quot; and the first season of the Hulu mystery thriller series &quot;The Other Black Girl&quot;, which both premiered the following year.

==Other projects==
McCormack has set up his own production company called Big Cattle Productions to develop ideas for television. The projects produced by the company include &quot;Lovespring International&quot; and &quot;Imperfect Union&quot;. In 2003, it was confirmed that he would write, direct, and star in the romantic comedy &quot;What You Wish For&quot;.

McCormack recorded a song, &quot;The Greatest Discovery&quot;, which was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin in 1970, for the 2006 album &quot;Unexpected Dreams – Songs from the Stars&quot;. He also wrote and sang a song called &quot;Living with Grace&quot; for the 2004 soundtrack to &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; with piano music provided by Barry Manilow.

==Personal life==
McCormack was married to Janet Leigh Holden, whom he met on the set of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, from August 1997 until November 2023. They have a son named Finnigan, a nod to &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, as Eric states in the documentary, &quot;Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make Believe&quot; (2023) airing on Prime Video. McCormack maintains residences in Los Angeles and Vancouver. He became an American citizen in 1999 and holds dual Canadian and American citizenship.

McCormack is involved in many Los Angeles and Canadian-based charitable organizations including Project Angel Food. The Wellness Community West Los Angeles Tribute to the Human Spirit Awards dinner presented an award to McCormack for his breast cancer awareness advocacy. He shared with the audience how his comedy helped his mother, Doris McCormack, endure her breast cancer treatments. Doris McCormack was honored at the Lifetime&#x27;s Breast Cancer Heroes Luncheon in 2004. He serves as an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) and was given the MMRF Spirit of Hope Award in October 2006.

McCormack sang both the American and Canadian national anthems at the 2004 NHL All-Star game in St Paul, Minnesota. He is a supporter of same-sex marriage and attended a march in Fresno, California on May 30, 2009, after the Supreme Court of California upheld a ban on same-sex marriage approved by voters in November by ballot Proposition 8. McCormack is a Democrat.

<doc id="696100" wikidata="Q585980" url="?curid=696100" title="Great cerebral vein">
<text>The great cerebral vein is one of the large blood vessels in the skull draining the cerebrum of the brain. It is also known as the vein of Galen, named for its discoverer, the Greek physician Galen.

== Structure ==
The great cerebral vein is one of the deep cerebral veins. Other deep cerebral veins are the internal cerebral veins, formed by the union of the superior thalamostriate vein and the superior choroid vein at the interventricular foramina. The internal cerebral veins can be seen on the superior surfaces of the caudate nuclei and thalami just under the corpus callosum. The veins at the anterior poles of the thalami merge posterior to the pineal gland to form the great cerebral vein. Most of the blood in the deep cerebral veins collects into the great cerebral vein. This comes from the inferior side of the posterior end of the corpus callosum and empties ie similarities, there are also differences between these two types of veins in the brain. The superficial veins at the dorsal parts of the hemispheres run upward and medially and empty into the large superior sagittal sinus in the upper margin of the falx cerebri. The superior sagittal sinus divides into two parts called the transverse sinuses where the falx cerebri meets the tentorium cerebelli. The sigmoid sinus, which continues the transverse sinus, empties into the jugular vein at the jugular foramen. The internal jugular vein leaves the skull and travels downward to the neck.

The length of the great cerebral vein of Galen varies from 0.15 to 4.2 cm (mean 0.93 cm).

The veins of the brain have very thin walls and contain no valves. They emerge in the brain and lie in the subarachnoid space. They pierce the arachnoid mater and the meningeal layer in the dura and drain into the cranial dural venous sinuses.

==Clinical significance==
===Malformations===

Most conditions associated with the great cerebral vein are due to congenital defects. Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) are the most common form of symptomatic cerebrovascular malformation in neonates and infants. The presence and locations of angiomas are very variable and do not follow any predictable pattern. The congenital malformation develops during weeks 6-11 of fetal development as a persistent embryonic prosencephalic vein of Markowski; thus, VGAM is actually a misnomer. The vein of Markowski actually drains into the vein of Galen. A falcine sinus lies within the falx cerebri and connects the vein of Galen and superior sagittal sinus; it is normally present during fetal development and involutes after birth, but its presence after birth is associated with a vein of Galen malformation and other vascular anomalies.
===Absence===
Absence of the great cerebral vein is a congenital disorder. The deep cerebral veins of the brain normally drain through the great cerebral vein. In its absence, the veins from the diencephalon and the basal ganglia drain laterally into the transverse sinus instead of conjoining in the midline through the Galenic drainage system. Absence of the great cerebral vein is quite rare. It is detected in infancy and most patients die in the neonatal period or in early infancy.

===Thrombosis===

Thrombosis of the great cerebral vein is a form of stroke due to a blood clot in the vein. It affects just 3 to 8% of patients, predominantly women. Patients may present with consciousness problems, headaches, nausea, visual defects, fatigue, disturbance of eye movements and pupillary reflexes, or coma. Thrombosis of the cerebral vein is often deadly but can be survived. Risk factors include oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and the postpartum period.

=== &quot;Will and Grace&quot; ===

The same year, he was cast as Jack McFarland, a flamboyantly gay and frequently unemployed actor, in the NBC comedy series &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. The show became a long-running hit and Hayes&#x27; performance earned him seven consecutive Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. He won the award for his first nomination. He was also nominated for six Golden Globe Awards for his performances.

=== Other television work ===
On November 15, 2010, he appeared in a satirical PSA for the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. In a 2008 interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hayes talked about a television project, &quot;BiCoastal&quot;, about &quot;a guy with a wife and kids in California and a boyfriend in New York&quot; for Showtime. He was the host of &quot;An All Star Tribute to James Burrows&quot;. Hayes has also guest starred as Buddy Wood on the NBC sitcom &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;.

=== Producing and production company ===

Aware that his role in &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; &quot;wouldn&#x27;t go on forever,&quot; Hayes teamed up with friend Todd Milliner, whom he met at Illinois State University, to create the television production company Hazy Mills Productions in 2004. Hayes was co-executive producer of the TV Land original comedy series &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, which premiered in June 2010 and ran for six seasons. He was also a co-executive producer of the NBC series &quot;Grimm&quot;, as well as creator and executive producer on another NBC series, &quot;Hollywood Game Night&quot;. Other television series produced by the company include &quot;The Soul Man&quot; and &quot;Sean Saves the World&quot;.

===Ventures with his husband===
Hayes and his husband, Scott Icenogle, produce lip-sync videos under their YouTube channel, The Kitchen Sync. They lip-synced to songs such as &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Burnitup!&quot;&quot;&quot; Hayes has always had an interest in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and memorized the whole musical piece.

=== Podcasting ===

In July 2020, Hayes, along with Will Arnett and Jason Bateman, created a comedy and talk podcast called &quot;SmartLess&quot;. He also hosts another podcast with Priyanka Wali called &quot;HypochondriActor&quot;. Hayes starred in and was one of the executive producers for the Netflix series &quot;Q-Force&quot;, released September 2, 2021.

==Personal life==
Hayes refused to discuss his sexual orientation for many years, saying he believed that audiences would therefore be more open-minded about his characters. Nevertheless, after the success of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, he was frustrated to find himself typecast, only receiving offers for gay roles. To avoid questions about his sexuality, he declined interview offers from gay publications during the run of the show. In response to a satirical piece run in &quot;The Advocate&quot;, which criticized him for being opaque about his sexual orientation, he appeared to imply that he is gay, stating: &quot;Really? You&#x27;re gonna shoot the gay guy down? I never have had a problem saying who I am. I am who I am.&quot; He also indicated that he was in a relationship. He feels he has &quot;contributed monumentally to the success of the gay movement in America, and if anyone wants to argue that, I&#x27;m open to it.&quot; After he received Outfest&#x27;s Trailblazer Award in 2016 he addressed this criticism in his speech, saying in part: &quot;Looking back at my choice to stay silent, I am ashamed and embarrassed. What was I thinking? [...] I know I should&#x27;ve come out sooner, and I&#x27;m sorry for that, especially when I think about the possibility that I might have made a difference in someone&#x27;s life.&quot;

He received an honorary PhD from Illinois State University in February 2013. In November 2014, Hayes announced that he had married his partner of eight years, Scott Icenogle. In October 2017, while appearing on an episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, Hayes revealed that he had been hospitalized with a rare condition in which his small intestine burst. The intestine was repaired.

Hayes has been open about living with atrial fibrillation, a cardiac disorder that causes him to frequently visit the ER to get his heart shocked back into sinus rhythm whenever his heartbeat is too irregular or rapid. About his condition, Hayes has said, &quot;When I go to the ER, I&#x27;m like Norm from &#x27;Cheers.&#x27; They&#x27;re like, &#x27;Sean!&#x27;, because I&#x27;m in there all the time.&quot;

<text>The United Counties League (also known after its sponsor as the &quot;GCE Hire Fleet Ltd. United Counties League&quot;) is an English football league covering an area including the English counties of northern Bedfordshire, northern Buckinghamshire, most of Cambridgeshire, southern Derbyshire, southern Leicestershire, most of Lincolnshire, western Norfolk, Northamptonshire, southern Nottinghamshire, northern Oxfordshire, Rutland, eastern Staffordshire, eastern Warwickshire and eastern West Midlands. It has a total of five divisions, three for first teams and two for reserve teams, but the reserves&#x27; divisions were merged into a single division for the 2013–14 season and remains so at present.

Clubs in the Premier Divisions are eligible to enter the FA Cup in the preliminary round stages. The clubs in the league are eligible for the FA Vase, and there are knockout cups for the Premier/Division One clubs and for the Reserve Divisions clubs.

==History==
The United Counties League was formed in 1895 as the Northamptonshire Junior League, dropping the &#x27;Junior&#x27; one year later. It took its current name in 1934 as teams from other counties had long since been a part of the league. Over the years the UCL has &#x27;united&#x27; teams from Northamptonshire, Rutland and Bedfordshire with those from parts of Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and even Norfolk. Northampton Town joined the league in 1897 and became champions in their second season before moving up to the Southern League. They would become the league&#x27;s first former member to reach the Football League in 1920. In 1900 Bedford Queens became the first club from outside the county to join the league.

The Football Association announced on 12 April 2021 that United Counties League would administer a new Step 5 division since the 2021–22 season after the scheduled National League System restructure had a one-season postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England.

==Current members==

===Step 5===
The league has two divisions at level 9 (step 5) of the National League System (NLS). Member clubs take part in cup competitions organised by the county FA to which they are affiliated and other cup competitions. The north division currently has 18 clubs, feeding into the Northern Premier League Division One Midlands and East. The south division currently has 20 clubs, feeding into the Northern Premier League Division One Midlands and Southern Football League Division One Central.


===Step 6 (Division One)===
Division One is at level 10 (step 6) in the football pyramid above five smaller local leagues below the recognised NLS: Central Midlands League, Leicestershire Senior League, Lincolnshire League, Northamptonshire Combination League and Nottinghamshire Senior League. There are currently 20 clubs in this division.
===Reserve Division===
The membership of the Reserve Division is made up largely of the reserve teams of clubs in the Premier Division and Division One of the United Counties League. It has run as a single division since season 2013–14, and currently contains sixteen teams.

<doc id="696132" wikidata="Q809758" url="?curid=696132" title="Basal-cell carcinoma">
<text>Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, basalioma or rodent ulcer, is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or results in death.
Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, having lighter skin, radiation therapy, long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function. Exposure to UV light during childhood is particularly harmful. Tanning beds have become another common source of ultraviolet radiation. Diagnosis often depends on skin examination, confirmed by tissue biopsy.
It remains unclear whether sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Treatment is typically by surgical removal. This can be by simple excision if the cancer is small; otherwise, Mohs surgery is generally recommended. Other options include electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, laser surgery or the use of imiquimod, a topical immune-activating medication. In the rare cases in which distant spread has occurred, chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be used.
Basal-cell cancer accounts for at least 32% of all cancers globally. Of skin cancers other than melanoma, about 80% are basal-cell cancers. In the United States, about 35% of white males and 25% of white females are affected by BCC at some point in their lives.

Basal-cell carcinoma is named after the basal cells that form the lowest layer of the epidermis. It is thought to develop from the folliculo–sebaceous–apocrine germinative cells called &quot;trichoblasts&quot; (of note, trichoblastic carcinoma is a term sometimes used to refer to a rare type of aggressive skin cancer that may resemble a benign trichoblastoma, and can also closely resemble basal cell carcinoma).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals with basal-cell carcinoma typically present with a shiny, pearly skin nodule. However, superficial basal-cell cancer can present as a red patch similar to eczema. Infiltrative or morpheaform basal-cell cancers can present as a skin thickening or scar tissue – making diagnosis difficult without using tactile sensation and a skin biopsy. It is often difficult to visually distinguish basal-cell cancer from acne scar, actinic elastosis, and recent cryodestruction inflammation.
==Cause==

The majority of basal-cell carcinomas occur on sun-exposed areas of the body.

==Pathophysiology==
&quot;Basal-cell carcinoma&quot; is named after the basal cells that populate the lowest layer of the epidermis due to the histological appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope. Nevertheless, not all basal-cell carcinomas actually originate within the basal layer. Basal-cell carcinomas are thought to develop from the folliculo–sebaceous–apocrine germinative cells known as &quot;trichoblasts&quot;. Trichoblastic carcinoma is a term used to describe a rare and potentially aggressive malignancy that is also thought to arise from trichoblasts and may resemble a benign trichoblastoma (differential diagnosis can be challenging). It has been suggested that lesions diagnosed as &#x27;trichoblastic carcinoma&#x27; may actually themselves be basal-cell carcinoma.

Overexposure to the sun leads to the formation of thymine dimers, a form of DNA damage. While DNA repair removes most UV-induced damage, not all crosslinks are excised. There is, therefore, cumulative DNA damage leading to mutations. Apart from the mutagenesis, overexposure to sunlight depresses the local immune system, possibly decreasing immune surveillance for new tumor cells. Studies of the role of DNA repair in susceptibility to sunlight-induced basal cell carcinoma indicated that reduced DNA repair capacity is one of the underlying molecular mechanisms for sunlight-induced skin carcinogenesis in the general population.

Basal-cell carcinomas can often come in association with other lesions of the skin, such as actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, and squamous cell carcinoma. In a small proportion of cases, basal-cell carcinoma also develops as a result of basal-cell nevus syndrome, or Gorlin Syndrome, which is also characterized by keratocystic odontogenic tumors of the jaw, palmar or plantar (sole of the foot) pits, calcification of the falx cerebri (in the center line of the brain) and rib abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 9q22.3, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway. A mutation in the SMO gene, which is also on the hedgehog pathway, also causes basal-cell carcinoma.

== Diagnosis ==

To diagnose basal-cell carcinomas, a skin biopsy is performed for histopathologic analyses. The most common method is a shave biopsy under local anesthesia. Most nodular basal-cell cancers can be diagnosed clinically; however, other variants can be very difficult to distinguish from benign lesions such as intradermal naevus, sebaceomas, fibrous papules, early acne scars, and hypertrophic scarring. Exfoliative cytology methods have high sensitivity and specificity for confirming the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma when clinical suspicion is high but unclear usefulness otherwise.

===Characteristics===

Basal-cell carcinoma cells appear similar to epidermal basal cells and are usually well differentiated.

In uncertain cases, immunohistochemistry using BerEP4 can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting only BCC cells.

=== Main classes ===
Basal-cell carcinoma can broadly be divided into three groups, based on the growth patterns.
# Superficial basal-cell carcinoma, formerly referred to as in-situ basal-cell carcinoma, is characterized by a superficial proliferation of neoplastic basal-cells. This tumor is generally responsive to topic chemotherapy, such as imiquimod, or fluorouracil, although surgical treatment is better able to ensure complete removal and confirm that there is not an underlying more aggressive subtype that was not sampled in the initial biopsy.
# Infiltrative basal-cell carcinoma, which also encompasses morpheaform and micronodular basal-cell cancer, is more difficult to treat with conservative methods, given its tendency to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin.
# Nodular basal-cell carcinoma includes most of the remaining categories of basal-cell cancer. It is not unusual to encounter heterogeneous morphologic features within the same tumor.

===Nodular basal-cell carcinoma===

Nodular basal-cell carcinoma (also known as &quot;classic basal-cell carcinoma&quot;) accounts for 50% of all BCC. It most commonly occurs on the sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Histopathology shows aggregates of basaloid cells with well-defined borders, showing a peripheral palisading of cells and one or more typical clefts. Such clefts are caused by shrinkage of mucin during tissue fixation and staining. Central necrosis with eosinophilic, granular features may be also present, as well as mucin. The heavy aggregates of mucin determine a cystic structure. Calcification may be also present, especially in long-standing lesions. Mitotic activity is usually not so evident, but a high mitotic rate may be present in more aggressive lesions. Adenoidal BCC can be classified as a variant of NBCC, characterized by basaloid cells with a reticulated configuration extending into the dermis.
===Other subtypes===
Other more specific subtypes of basal-cell carcinoma include:
===Aggressiveness patterns===
There are mainly three patterns of aggressiveness, based mainly on the cohesion of cancer cells:
===Differential diagnoses===
===Radicality===

In suspected but uncertain BCC cells close to the resection margins, immunohistochemistry with BerEp4 can highlight the BCC cells.

== Prevention ==
Basal-cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer and occurs mainly in fair-skinned patients with a family history of this cancer. Sunlight is a factor in about two-thirds of these cancers; therefore, doctors recommend sunscreens with at least SPF 30. However, a Cochrane review examining the effect of solar protection (sunscreen only) in preventing the development of basal-cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma found that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether sunscreen was effective for the prevention of either of these keratinocyte-derived cancers. The review did ultimately state that the certainty of these results was low, so future evidence could very well alter this conclusion. One-third occur in non-sun-exposed areas; thus, the pathogenesis is more complex than UV exposure as &quot;the&quot; cause.

The use of a chemotherapeutic agent such as 5-Fluorouracil or imiquimod can prevent the development of skin cancer. It is usually recommended to individuals with extensive sun damage, a history of multiple skin cancers, or rudimentary forms of cancer (i.e., solar keratosis). It is often repeated every 2 to 3 years to further decrease the risk of skin cancer.

== Treatment ==

The following methods are employed in the treatment of basal-cell carcinoma (BCC):

=== Standard surgical excision ===
Surgery to remove the basal-cell carcinoma affected area and the surrounding skin is thought to be the most effective treatment. A disadvantage with standard surgical excision is a reported higher recurrence rate of basal-cell cancers of the face, especially around the eyelids, nose, and facial structures. There is no clear approach, nor clear research comparing the effectiveness of Mohs micrographic surgery versus surgical excision for BCC of the eye.

For basal cell carcinoma excisions on the lower lip, the wound can be covered with a keystone flap. A keystone flap is achieved by creating a flap below the defect and pulling it superiorly to cover the wound. This can be performed if there is enough skin laxity to cover the defect and adequate blood supply to the flap.

=== Mohs surgery ===
For many new (primary) and all recurrent forms of basal cell carcinoma after previous surgery, especially on the head, neck, hands, feet, genitalia, and anterior legs (shins), Mohs surgery should be considered.

Mohs surgery (or Mohs micrographic surgery) is an outpatient procedure, developed by Frederic E. Mohs in the 1930s, in which the tumor is surgically excised and then immediately examined under a microscope. It is a form of pathology processing called CCPDMA, which means that the entire surgical margin (both edges and deep) is examined. During the surgery, after each removal of tissue and while the patient waits, the tissue is examined for cancer cells. That examination dictates the decision for additional tissue removal. Mohs surgery is also used for squamous-cell carcinoma, melanoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and multiple other skin cancers; usually with cure rates higher than for other surgical and non-surgical treatments.

An essential aspect of Mohs surgery is that the Mohs surgeon performs the surgery and personally reviews the Mohs pathology slides. Most standard excisions done in an office setting are sent to an outside laboratory for standard bread loafing methods of processing. With this method, it is likely that less than 5% of the surgical margin is examined, as each slice of tissue is only 6 micrometres thick, about 3 to 4 serial slices are obtained per section, and only about 3 to 4 sections are obtained per specimen.

=== Cryosurgery ===
Cryosurgery is an old modality for the treatment of many skin cancers. When accurately utilized with a temperature probe and cryotherapy instruments, it can result in a very good cure rate. Disadvantages include lack of margin control, tissue necrosis, over or under-treatment of the tumor, and long recovery time. Overall, there are sufficient data to consider cryosurgery as a reasonable treatment for BCC. There are no good studies, however, comparing cryosurgery with other modalities, particularly with Mohs surgery, excision, or electrodesiccation and curettage so no conclusion can be made whether cryosurgery is as efficacious as other methods. Also, there is no evidence on whether curetting the lesions before cryosurgery affects the efficacy of treatment. Several textbooks are published on the therapy, and a few physicians still apply the treatment to selected patients.

=== Electrodesiccation and curettage ===
Electrodesiccation and curettage (EDC, also known as curettage and cautery, simply curettage) is accomplished by using a round knife, or curette, to scrape away the soft cancer. The skin is then burned with an electric current. This further softens the skin, allowing for the knife to cut more deeply with the next layer of curettage. The cycle is repeated, with a safety margin of curettage of normal skin around the visible tumor. This cycle is repeated 3 to 5 times, and the free skin margin treated is usually 4 to 6 mm. Cure rate is very much user-dependent and depends also on the size and type of tumor. Infiltrative or morpheaform BCCs can be difficult to eradicate with EDC. Generally, this method is used on cosmetically unimportant areas like the trunk (torso). Some physicians believe that it is acceptable to utilize EDC on the face of elderly patients over the age of 70. However, with increasing life expectancy, such an objective criterion cannot be supported. The cure rate can vary, depending on the aggressiveness of the EDC and the free margin treated. Some advocate curettage alone without electrodesiccation, and with the same cure rate.

=== Chemotherapy ===
Some superficial cancers respond to local therapy with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy agent. One can expect a great deal of inflammation with this treatment. Chemotherapy often follows Mohs surgery to eliminate the residual superficial basal-cell carcinoma after the invasive portion is removed. 5-fluorouracil has received FDA approval.

Removing the residual superficial tumor with surgery alone can result in large and difficult-to-repair surgical defects. One often waits a month or more after surgery before starting the immunotherapy or chemotherapy to make sure the surgical wound has adequately healed. Some people advocate the use of curettage (see EDC below) first, followed by chemotherapy. These experimental procedures are not standard care.

Vismodegib and sonidegib are drugs approved for specially treating BCC, but are expensive and cannot be used in pregnant women.

Itraconazole, traditionally an anti-fungal medication, has also garnered recent attention for its potential use in the treatment of BCC, especially those that cannot be removed surgically. Possessing anti-Hedgehog pathway activity, there is clinical evidence that itraconazole has some efficacy either alone or when combined with vismodegib/sonidegib for primary and recurrent BCC. There is one case report of efficacy in metastatic BCC.

=== Immunotherapy ===
This technique uses the body&#x27;s immune system to kill cancer cells. Improvement of the immune system works its way out up to the cancerous cells and treat the skin cancer.

Topical treatment with 5% Imiquimod cream (IMQ), with five applications per week for six weeks, has a reported 70–90% success rate at reducing, even removing, the BCC [basal-cell carcinoma]. Imiquimod has received FDA approval and topical IMQ is approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of small superficial basal-cell carcinoma. Off-label use of imiquimod on invasive basal-cell carcinoma has been reported. Imiquimod may be used before surgery to reduce the size of the carcinoma.

Some advocate the use of imiquimod before Mohs surgery to remove the superficial component of the cancer.

Research suggests that treatment using &quot;Euphorbia peplus&quot;, a common garden weed, may be effective. Australian biopharmaceutical company Peplin is developing this as topical treatment for BCC.

=== Radiation ===
Radiation therapy can be delivered either as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (mostly internal radiotherapy). Although radiotherapy is generally used in older patients who are not candidates for surgery, it is also used in cases where surgical excision will be disfiguring or difficult to reconstruct (especially on the tip of the nose, and the nostril rims). Radiation treatment with external radiation often takes as few as 5 visits to as many as 25 visits. Usually, the more visits scheduled for therapy, the less complication or damage is done to the normal tissue supporting the tumor. Radiotherapy can also be useful if surgical excision has been done incompletely or if the pathology report following surgery suggests a high risk of recurrence, for example, if nerve involvement has been demonstrated. The cure rate can be as high as 95% for small tumors, or as low as 80% for large tumors. A variation of an external brachytherapy is the epidermal radioisotope therapy (e.g. with 188Re in the form of the Rhenium-SCT). It is used in accordance with the general indications for brachytherapy and especially complex localisations or structures (e.g. earlobe) as well as the genitals.

Usually, recurrent tumors after radiation are treated with surgery, and not with radiation. Further radiation treatment will further damage normal tissue, and the tumor might be resistant to further radiation. Radiation therapy may be contraindicated for treatment of nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome. A 2008 study reported that radiation therapy is appropriate for primary BCCs and recurrent BCCs, but not for BCCs that have recurred following previous radiation treatment.

=== Photodynamic therapy ===
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new modality for the treatment of basal-cell carcinoma, which is administered by application of photosensitizers to the target area. When these molecules are activated by light, they become toxic, therefore destroying the target cells. Methyl aminolevulinate is approved by the EU as a photosensitizer since 2001. This therapy is also used in other skin cancer types. A 2008 study reported that PDT was a good treatment option for primary superficial BCCs and reasonable for primary low-risk nodular BCCs, but was a &quot;relatively poor&quot; option for high-risk lesions.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis is excellent if the appropriate method of treatment is used in early primary basal-cell cancers. Recurrent cancers are much harder to cure, with a higher recurrence rate with any method of treatment. Although basal-cell carcinoma rarely metastasizes, it grows locally with invasion and destruction of local tissues. The cancer can impinge on vital structures like nerves and result in loss of sensation or loss of function or rarely death. The vast majority of cases can be successfully treated before serious complications occur. The recurrence rate for the above treatment options ranges from 50 percent to 1 percent or less.

The nose and the temporal region are the most common areas of basal-cell carcinoma of the face. When completely excised, the recurrence rate for basal-cell carcinoma is relatively low. However, when recurrence occurs among surgically treated basal-cell carcinomas of the face, there is a strong correlation with tumor thickness.

== Epidemiology ==
Basal-cell cancer is a very common skin cancer. It is much more common in fair-skinned individuals with a family history of basal-cell cancer and increases in incidence closer to the equator or at higher altitudes. It is very common among elderly people over the age of 80. There are approximately 800,000 new cases yearly in the United States alone. Up to 30% of white people develop basal-cell carcinomas in their lifetime. In Canada, the most common skin cancer is basal-cell carcinoma (as much as one-third of all cancer diagnoses), affecting 1 in 7 individuals over a lifetime. This tumor accounts for approximately 70% of non-melanoma skin cancers. In 80 percent of all cases, basal-cell carcinoma affects the head or neck skin.

Most sporadic BCC arises in small numbers on sun-exposed skin of people over age 50, although younger people may also be affected. The development of multiple basal-cell cancer at an early age could be indicative of nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome, also known as &quot;Gorlin syndrome&quot;.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons, and the rankings for 1988–89 were also based on results from the preceding two seasons.

Being ranked in the top 16 exempted players from the qualifying rounds for the World Snooker Championship and also meant inclusion in certain invitational events. The top 32 ranked players were exempt from the early qualifying rounds of the other ranking tournaments.

The top three players in the 1987–88 rankings retained their positions for 1988–89. Steve Davis was ranked first, with 59 points, ahead of Jimmy White with 44 and Neal Foulds with 34. In fourth place, with 33 points, was Stephen Hendry, who rose from 23rd position on the previous year&#x27;s list. The other players to join the top 16 were Peter Francisco, John Virgo, and Cliff Wilson.

The players dropping out of the top 16 were Alex Higgins, Rex Williams, Dean Reynolds and Doug Mountjoy. It was first time since the rankings were instituted in 1976–77 that Higgins was not among the top 16. In April 1987, he had been excluded from competing in the first two ranking tournaments of the 1987–88 season as part of a six-month ban imposed by the WPBSA, following a hearing conducted for the Association by Gavin Lightman, a barrister. Higgins, who had previously been disciplined by the Association on several occasions, had earlier been found guilty in court of headbutting the tournament director at the 1986 UK Championship, and the hearing considered this and other matters including altercations with referees and a complaint by representatives of Cliff Thorburn that Higgins had alleged in newspaper articles that Thorburn used drugs.

In May 1988, Thorburn had two ranking points deducted for &quot;bringing the game into disrepute&quot; due to failing a drugs test at the 1988 British Open. Thorburn had been found to have small traces of cocaine in his urine sample. Thorburn was also barred from the first two ranking events of the 1988–89 season as part of his punishment. Without the deduction of the two points, Thorburn would have been ranked a place higher, at fifth.

Of the players who had only been competing professionally for one season, Martin Clark was the highest-ranked, at 41st, with Gary Wilkinson at 44th the next-highest. Alain Robidoux received two walkovers at the 1988 World Snooker Championship before losing in the third round and gained a ranking of 102nd without winning a match.

== Points tariff and basis of ranking ==

The placings in the 1988–89 rankings were determined by players&#x27; performances in the ranking tournaments held across two seasons, from 1986 to 1988. From the 1986–87 season they were the 1986 International Open won by Foulds; the 1986 Grand Prix and the 1987 British Open both won by White; and the 1986 UK Championship, the 1987 Classic and the 1987 World Championship all won by Davis.

In the 1987–88 season, Davis won four of the six ranking titles: the 1987 International Open, the 1987 UK Championship, the 1988 Classic and the 1988 World Championship. Hendry won the other two, the 1987 Grand Prix and the 1988 British Open.

The rankings were based on a system of points described in the table below. The ranking order was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points.
*If there was a tie on points, the player who earned more points in the most recent season was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player with more merit points was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player who earned more merit points in the most recent season was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player who earned more merit points in the season prior to the most recent was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player with more A points was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player with more frames won was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player with the better performance in the previous World Championship was given the higher ranking.
*If there was still a tie, the player with the better performance in the previous ranking tournament was given the higher ranking, going back through ranking events until the positions could be established.

== Rankings ==
Key:
*&quot;(New)&quot; denotes a player that was a new professional for 1987–88.
*&quot;(NT)&quot; denotes a &quot;non-tournament&quot; player, i.e. a player who was permitted to enter the world championship but no other tournaments in 1988–89.
*&quot;(NewNT)&quot; is a player who was a new, non-tournament professional for 1987–88, allowed to play only in the world championship that season. 
*&quot;–&quot; denotes that the player did not compete in the tournament.
*&quot;X&quot; denotes that the player was banned from competing in the tournament.

So I get a call one day from my agent that I&#x27;d gotten offered a guest role, and it paid $5,000. I literally fell down onto my knees and testified and wept. I played some former protégée of Jessica Fletcher. It&#x27;s one of my favorite things I&#x27;ve ever shot.&quot;

In 1989, Mullally tested for the role of Elaine Benes on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The role was eventually given to Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In 1998, Mullally landed the role of Karen Walker, Grace Adler&#x27;s abrasive, pill-popping assistant, in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

<text>Beatrice Muriel Hill Tinsley (27 January 1941 – 23 March 1981) was a British-born New Zealand astronomer and cosmologist, and the first female professor of astronomy at Yale University, whose research made fundamental contributions to the astronomical understanding of how galaxies evolve, grow and die.

==Life==
Beatrice Hill was born 1941 in Chester, England, as the middle of three daughters of Jean and Edward Hill. The family emigrated to New Zealand following World War II, first living in Christchurch, and then for a longer time in New Plymouth, where her father was a clergyman, Moral Re-Armer, and later became the mayor (1953–56).

While studying in Christchurch, she married physicist and university classmate Brian Tinsley, not knowing that this would prevent her from working at the university while he was employed there. Tinsley completed her master&#x27;s thesis in 1962. They moved in 1963 to the United States, to Dallas, Texas, where Brian was hired by the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (now the University of Texas at Dallas). However, she was said to have found the situation &quot;stultifying&quot;, and had once caused a controversy by refusing to follow the custom of hosting a faculty tea. In 1964, she enrolled at UT-Austin, where she was the only woman in the astronomy programme and where she would later publish her groundbreaking research.

Despite receiving recognition for her work, Tinsley was unable to find a permanent academic position. In 1974, after years of attempting to balance home, family and two commuting careers, she left her husband and two adopted children to take a position as assistant professor at Yale. On 1 July 1978 she was appointed a professor of astronomy at Yale, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She worked at Yale until her death from melanoma in the Yale Infirmary in 1981.

==Professional activity==
Tinsley completed pioneering theoretical studies of how populations of stars age and affect the observable qualities of galaxies. She also collaborated on basic research into models investigating whether the universe is closed or open. Her galaxy models led to the first approximation of what protogalaxies should look like.

In 1974 she received the American Astronomical Society&#x27;s Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy, awarded for &quot;outstanding research and promise for future research by a postdoctoral woman researcher&quot;, in recognition of her work on galaxy evolution.

In 1977, Tinsley, with Richard Larson of Yale, organised a conference on &#x27;The Evolution of Galaxies and Stellar Populations&#x27;.

Shortly after, in 1978, she became the first female professor of astronomy at Yale University. Her last scientific paper, submitted to &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; ten days before her death, was published posthumously that November, without revision.

==Death==
Tinsley died of melanoma on 23 March 1981, at the age of 40. Her ashes are buried at Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven, Connecticut, which is surrounded by the Yale University campus. 
==Tributes==

In 1986 the American Astronomical Society established the Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize, which recognises &quot;an outstanding research contribution to astronomy or astrophysics, of an exceptionally creative or innovative character.&quot; It is the only major award created by an American scientific society which honours a woman scientist. The award is not made with restriction on a candidate&#x27;s citizenship or country of residence.

The main-belt asteroid 3087 Beatrice Tinsley, discovered in 1981 at Mt John University Observatory near Tekapo, is also named after her.

The University of Texas at Austin established from endowment in 1989 the Beatrice M. Tinsley Centennial Visiting Professorship, where a distinguished mid-career or senior professor is invited to visit for up to a semester. In 2007 they added the Tinsley Scholars, awards for younger researchers to briefly visit Austin.

In 2005, the Circa Theatre in Wellington produced a play called &quot;Bright Star&quot;, about the life of Beatrice Tinsley. The Wellington Astronomical Society held telescope viewing sessions outside the theatre, on the wharf next to the Te Papa Museum.

In December 2010 the New Zealand Geographic Board officially named a mountain in Fiordland&#x27;s Kepler Mountains (which are named for astronomer Johannes Kepler) as Mt Tinsley.

The Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand established the Beatrice Hill Tinsley Lectures in 2012.

Beatrice Tinsley Crescent in Rosedale, on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, is named for her.

On 27 January 2016, the 75th anniversary of her birth, Google published a Doodle to honour her work. In the same year, the New Zealand Association of Scientists renamed the Research Medal the Hill Tinsley Medal in Tinsley&#x27;s honour. In 2017, Tinsley was one of the Royal Society Te Apārangi&#x27;s &quot;150 women in 150 words&quot;, celebrating women&#x27;s contribution to knowledge in New Zealand.

Her obituary was published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; several decades later on 18 July 2018, in their &quot;Overlooked&quot; project, which aims to note &quot;the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in &quot;The Times&quot;&quot;.

In 2018, the Yale Society of Physics Students began an inaugural prize lecture in honour of Tinsley.

A 2019 $1.20 New Zealand postage stamp in a series of &quot;New Zealand Space Pioneers&quot; honours her.

The University of Canterbury College of Science named their staff and postgraduate building after Tinsley, which was opened in October 2019 by the Honourable Dr Megan Woods, Vice-Chancellor Cheryl de la Rey, and Pro-Vice Chancellor of Science Professor Wendy Lawson. The building uses Pres-Lam technology developed at the university.

The final track on the 2022 Forenzics album &quot;Shades and Echoes&quot;, &quot;Autumn&quot;, is credited &quot;Words by NZ astronomer Beatrice Hill Tinsley – adapted with permission by T. Finn&quot;.

<doc id="696146" wikidata="Q2656203" url="?curid=696146" title="1989–90 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The 1983–84 snooker world rankings were the first to take tournaments other than world championship into account, and several additional tournaments were designated as ranking tournaments over the following years. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons, and the rankings for 1989–90 were also based on results from the preceding two seasons. Barry Hearn, the manager of a number of leading players including Steve Davis and Jimmy White, made a proposal to the WPBSA to change the system so that only the best seven performances from the ten ranking tournaments were counted. It was rejected at an extraordinary meeting of the WPBSA in May 1989.

Davis retained top place in the rankings for the seventh consecutive year. John Parrott moved up five places to second, followed by Stephen Hendry who improved by one place from fourth. The top 16 in the rankings were exempted from the qualifying rounds for the World Snooker Championship and were included in certain invitational events. Doug Mountjoy, Tony Meo and Dean Reynolds returned to the top 16, and Steve James joined the top 16 for the first time. Cliff Wilson, Neal Foulds, Silvino Francisco and Peter Francisco dropped out of the top 16. Of the players who had only competed for one season, Mark Johnston-Allen and Darren Morgan placed highest, at 51st and 52nd respectively. At the end of his first full season as a professional, Alain Robidoux rose from 102nd to 35th place.

In April 1987, Alex Higgins had been excluded from competing in the first two ranking tournaments of the 1987–88 season as part of a six-month ban imposed by the WPBSA, following a hearing conducted for the Association by Gavin Lightman, a barrister, after Higgins had been found guilty in court of headbutting the tournament director at the 1986 UK Championship. Thorburn had two ranking points deducted for &quot;bringing the game into disrepute&quot; due to failing a drugs test at the 1988 British Open, and was barred from the first two ranking events of the 1988–89 season as part of his punishment. Bill Werbeniuk was expelled from the WPBSA in March 1989 after not paying a fine that the Association had imposed for his use of a beta blocker medication, but was readmitted in September and allowed to play in the 1990 World Snooker Championship.

Davis did not compete in the 1989 European Open, a ranking event, citing exhaustion. Reynolds also missed the event, saying that he needed a rest. Both were fined £200 by the WPBSA for missing the event. Among the other players fined for missing events was Kirk Stevens, who was penalised £200 for his absence at the 1988 International Open.

== Points tariff and basis of ranking==

Ranking was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points.
*If players had an equal number of ranking points, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, merit points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, A points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, frames won were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given the player with the better performances in the later season.

==Rankings==
Key:
*&quot;(New)&quot; denotes a player that was a new professional for 1988–89.
*&quot;(NT)&quot; denotes a non-tournament player, i.e. a player who was permitted to enter the world championship but no other tournaments in 1989–90.
*&quot;N&quot; denotes that as a non-tournament player, the player was not eligible to enter.
*&quot;–&quot; denotes that the player did not compete in the tournament.
*&quot;X&quot; denotes that the player was banned from competing in the tournament.

<doc id="696160" wikidata="Q272594" url="?curid=696160" title="Shelley Morrison">
<text>Shelley Morrison (born Rachel Mitrani; October 26, 1936 – December 1, 2019) was an American actress. Morrison was known for her role as maid Rosario Salazar in the NBC comedy &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, which she played from 1999 to 2006. She was also a regular performer on the sitcom &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, playing Sister Sixto, a nun known mostly for mangling the English language, and she had a recurring role in the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1982. She was also the voice of Mrs. Portillo in the animated Disney show &quot;Handy Manny&quot;.

==Early life==
Morrison was born in the South Bronx, New York City, the only daughter of Hortense, a homemaker, and Maurice Mitrani, a clothing manufacturer. Her parents were both Sephardic Jews. She was initially raised in the Bronx before moving to Los Angeles, California when she was ten years old. 

==Career==
Morrison studied acting at Los Angeles City College and landed early film roles in &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; and &quot;How to Save a Marriage and Ruin Your Life&quot;.

From 1965 to 1967, she appeared four times as an American Indian, Linda Little Trees, in the television series &quot;Laredo&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Yahoo&quot;, &quot;Jinx&quot;, &quot;No Bugles, One Drum&quot;, and &quot;Split the Difference.&quot;) In 1966 she played “Addie Moonercan” in the episode “Which Doctor” of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. In 1967, she played the Puerto Rican nun Sister Sixto, who had trouble with English, in Sally Field&#x27;s show &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;. She played this role until the show was cancelled in 1970. Morrison also appeared in the 1997 romantic comedy film &quot;Fools Rush In&quot;, starring Salma Hayek and Matthew Perry, as well as more dramatic films such as &quot;Blume in Love&quot; and &quot;Breezy&quot; (both 1973).

One of Morrison&#x27;s notable roles was as the Salvadoran maid Rosario Inés Consuelo Yolanda Salazar on sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. She appeared in 64 episodes from 1999 to 2006 (as well as a brief cameo on the September 2016 &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; webisode in support of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign). The role originally was created for a brief one-episode appearance, but Rosario was so popular with viewers that she became a recurring character. In addition to sparring with her libertine and very spoiled employer Karen Walker (Megan Mullally), Rosario married Karen&#x27;s gay friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) to prevent her deportation.

Among approximately 25 film appearances and 200 television appearances, Morrison portrayed a maid or housekeeper on 32 separate occasions. Morrison had just informed her agent not to offer her any more &quot;maid parts&quot; when the call came for &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. In 2017, NBC revived &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; for a new series of episodes. On August 3, 2017, co-creator Max Mutchnick announced to reporters that Morrison had been asked to reprise her role as Salazar on the show, but that she ultimately decided to retire completely from acting. Although her last official acting role was a voiceover in the 2012 animated film &quot;Foodfight!&quot;, her final appearance as an actress was the 2016 election-themed webisode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

==Death==
Morrison died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on December 1, 2019, as a result of heart failure after a brief illness. She was 83 years old.

<text>The City is a book by Max Weber, a German economist and sociologist. It was published posthumously in 1921. In 1924 it was incorporated into a larger book, &quot;Economy and Society&quot;. An English translation was made in 1958 and several editions have been released since then.

It is likely that Weber compiled that research in 1911–1913, although it contains materials he found before that time.

The analysis of city consists of many different subjects—including study of religion (especially Protestantism), history of development of democracy in Western Europe.

Weber argues that the development of cities in European culture (Occidental cities) as an associations with its own municipal officials was influenced by such factors as:

* the religion of Christianity
* the privileged legal position of the citizens (based upon citizen&#x27;s obligation for military service)
* the decline of religious sanctions of kinship solidarity that facilitated creation of unified urban community

That made the city&#x27;s population easily influenced by later ideas of the Reformers.

In Weber&#x27;s own words:

<doc id="696166" wikidata="Q1265107" url="?curid=696166" title="Joy (programming language)">
<text>The Joy programming language in computer science is a purely functional programming language that was produced by Manfred von Thun of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. Joy is based on composition of functions rather than lambda calculus. It was inspired by the function-level programming style of John Backus&#x27;s FP.
It has turned out to have many similarities to Forth, due not to design but to an independent evolution and convergence.

== Overview ==

Functions in Joy lack formal parameters. For example, a function that squares a numeric input can be expressed as follows:

 DEFINE square == dup * .

In Joy, everything is a function that takes a stack as an argument and returns a stack as a result. For instance, the numeral &#x27;5&#x27; does not represent an integer constant, but instead a short program that pushes the number 5 onto the stack.

* The dup operator simply duplicates the top element of the stack by pushing a copy of it.
* The * operator pops two numbers off the stack and pushes their product.

So the square function makes a copy of the top element, and then multiplies the two top elements of the stack, leaving the square of the original top element at the top of the stack, with no need for a formal parameter. This makes Joy concise, as illustrated by this definition of quicksort:

== Mathematical purity ==
Joy is a concatenative programming language: &quot;The concatenation of two programs denotes the composition of the functions denoted by the two programs&quot;.

<doc id="696196" wikidata="Q1248504" url="?curid=696196" title="The Flying Nun">
<text>The Flying Nun is an American fantasy sitcom television series about a community of nuns, which included one who could fly when the wind caught her cornette. It was produced by Screen Gems for ABC based on the 1965 book &quot;The Fifteenth Pelican&quot;, written by Tere Ríos. Sally Field starred as the title character, Sister Bertrille.

The series originally ran on ABC from September 7, 1967, to April 3, 1970, producing 82 episodes, including a one-hour pilot episode.

==Overview==
Developed by Bernard Slade, the series centered on the adventures of a community of nuns in the Convent San Tanco in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It focuses on Sister Bertrille, a young, idealistic novice nun who discovers she can fly, whose order teaches largely underprivileged and orphaned children and assists the poor of a diverse Hispanic community (a rare setting for American network television of the era).

In the hour-long series pilot, Chicago native Elsie Ethrington arrives in San Juan from New York City after her arrest for having been involved in a free speech protest; she then adopts the name of Sister Bertrille. It is also later learned (in the episode &quot;My Sister, The Sister&quot;) that she comes from a family of physicians, and that she is the only one who did not follow in their footsteps. She instead became a nun, breaking up with her toy-salesman boyfriend and joining the Convent San Tanco after being impressed by her aunt&#x27;s missionary work.

Sister Bertrille could be relied upon to solve any problem that came her way by her ability to catch a passing breeze and fly. This was generally attributed to her weighing under , high winds at the Convent high on the ocean bluffs, and the large, heavily starched cornette that was the headpiece for her habit. (The cornette was based on one worn until the mid-1960s by the Daughters of Charity, although Sister Bertrille was never said to belong to that order. The order which included the Convent San Tanco was never actually specified in the series.) Her flying talents could cause as many problems as they solved, per the sitcom format, but she most often used her gift to help people, or at least with good intentions.

She explains her ability to fly by stating, &quot;When lift plus thrust is greater than load plus drag, anything can fly.&quot; In one episode, she tries to gain weight so she can stay grounded, but the attempt fails. Additionally, in the first-season episode &quot;Young Man with a Cornette,&quot; she specifically tells a young boy who intended to use her cornette to fly that there were many factors other than her weight (which was distributed differently from that of the boy) that made her flying possible. She was unable to take off when heavy rains caused her starched cornette to lose its shape, when she had to wear something that would keep her grounded at all times, or, on one occasion in the episode titled &quot;The Flying Dodo&quot;, when an inner ear infection caused her to lose her balance.

For a series often accused of being outlandish, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; treated Sister Bertrille&#x27;s gift of flight more realistically than other fantasy comedies of the era. On other such series of the period, there were elaborate, often frantic attempts to hide and keep secret the special powers, a constant dilemma on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. In most cases, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; dealt with its premise more logically. Quite often, Sister Bertrille and the nuns freely admitted her ability to fly, asking for discretion in hopes that it would not draw attention to the needs and efforts of the convent. Secrecy was necessary (and occasionally humorously so) only for any characters who would not understand, or might make the situation exploitative, widely public, subject to ridicule, or otherwise disruptive.

One memorable episode (without a laugh track) featured only two actors, Sally Field and actor/director Henry Jaglom, trapped in a cave, in an often-bitter exchange. Upon learning she could fly so she could rescue them, he began to reconsider—not in an absurdly miraculous but believable way—his shattered perspective on life.

==Cast==
* Sally Field as Sister Bertrille/Elsie Ethrington, a novice nun who weighs only 90 pounds, allowing her to fly while wearing her cornette and when the wind is right. This was Field&#x27;s second situation-comedy role, following &quot;Gidget.&quot;
* Madeleine Sherwood as Reverend Mother Placido, the somber but gentle woman who runs the convent.
* Marge Redmond as Sister Jacqueline, a wise nun with a sense of humor and Sister Bertrille&#x27;s friend. Her voice is also heard as the narrator, who provides a friendly, tongue-in-cheek narration throughout each episode.
* Alejandro Rey as Carlos Ramirez, a local casino owner and playboy. Ramirez is an orphan raised by the nuns, and though his is a &quot;sinful&quot; life by comparison to their ideals, he still maintains his gratitude, helping them whenever he can. This constantly leads him to get swept, usually against his will, into Sister Bertrille&#x27;s zany schemes, which she concocts with alarming frequency. Rey also appeared in a dual role in two episodes as Carlos&#x27;s mild-mannered, inventive but naive twin cousin Luis Ramirez.
* Shelley Morrison as Sister Sixto, a Puerto Rican nun who always misinterprets English slang. In the third season, after someone corrected her, she replied with a rejoinder with logic for the phrase.
* Linda Dangcil as Sister Ana, another young novice.
* Vito Scotti as Captain Gaspar Fomento, the local police officer and the only regular character in the series who never knew about Sister Bertrille&#x27;s ability to fly.
* Elinor Donahue as Jennifer Ethrington, Sister Bertrille&#x27;s sister, a dedicated, if overscheduled, pediatrician. Jennifer politely declined Carlos&#x27; proposal of marriage and eventually married a doctor.
* Rich Little as Brother Paul, a brilliant but disaster-prone monk.
* Don Diamond as Dr. Tapia, San Tanco&#x27;s local physician (season one) and Chief Galindo, Captain Fomento&#x27;s long-suffering superior.
* Michael Pataki as Sgt. Salazar, sidekick to Captain Fomento (season two); Roberto, Carlo&#x27;s good-natured assistant (season three); and Pedro (season one).

==Production==
After the cancellation of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Gidget,&quot; starring Sally Field in the title role, producers sought a way to keep Field on the air. As a result, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; was developed. Seeking more mature roles, Field found the concept of the show ridiculous and refused the role at first, only to reconsider after her stepfather Jock Mahoney warned her that she might not work again in show business if she did not accept the role.
Screen Gems dismissed its second choice, Ronne Troup, who had already begun filming the pilot.

Field recalled hanging from a crane and being humiliated by a parade of episodic television directors, one of whom grabbed her shoulders and moved her into position as if she were a prop. She credits co-star Madeleine Sherwood for encouraging her to enroll in acting classes. Field commented that she has great affection for her young &quot;Gidget&quot; persona and was proud of her work on that show, but confirmed she did not enjoy her time on &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, due to regular jokes from comedians, unflattering spoofs, and negative press that ridiculed the premise, which she took to mean herself. The title was used as a punchline without considering the series or its leads.

In the Season One DVD interview, Field states that it was Harry Ackerman&#x27;s decision to give the series the instantly mockable but easily marketable title, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; rather than give it the book&#x27;s title, &quot;The Fifteenth Pelican&quot;. Field expressed great affection for &quot;Flying Nun&quot; co-stars, including Marge Redmond and Alejandro Rey, who she said was considerate and taught her by example to speak up for herself, indicating that &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; ultimately was a tough but crucial training ground for the career that was to unfold before her.

Prior to the production of &quot;The Flying Nun,&quot; producers were concerned with how the series would be received by the Catholic Church as well as individual Catholics. In an effort to prevent religious criticism, the National Catholic Office for Radio and Television (NCORT) served as a series adviser, with on-screen credit. The NCORT, like its motion-picture counterpart, the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures, was ultimately absorbed into the United States Catholic Conference, and both were later merged into the Office for Film and Broadcasting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, or USCCB.
Due to the generally positive portrayal of the nuns&#x27; religious and social activities, the series was rarely criticized by Catholic authorities and was favorably received by many.
The San Juan convent courtyard exterior was the rear area of a house façade at the Warner Brothers Ranch&#x27;s suburban street/backlot in Burbank, California, along Hollywood Way north of West Oak Street. The pilot episode and the series opening and closing credits were filmed on location in Puerto Rico. Serra Retreat Center, Malibu, has photos in one of their conference rooms stating the exterior was shot there. On September 25, 1970, the Malibu Canyon Wildfire destroyed the original buildings.

The series changed comedic gears in its second season with more slapstick and broad humor, focusing on bungling police Captain Gaspar Fomento (played by Vito Scotti) as well as occasional incongruous flying scenes for Field. The series reverted to the warmer tone of the first season and more socially relevant storylines by its final season.

Throughout the entire run, most stories concerned helping people in need, community service, literacy, education and the diversity of people and their faiths. &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; was one of the few American &#x27;60s sitcoms set in a low-income ethnic community. By the third season, the series had found its footing, and the flying premise became unnecessary enough to the storylines that often the scripts would have to contrive reasons for at least one &quot;flight&quot; per episode.
Field was pregnant at the beginning of Season 3. Props and scenery were used to block specific views of Field and using long shots of stunt doubles for the flying sequences.

Following the deaths of Shelley Morrison in 2019 and Marge Redmond in 2020, Field is the only surviving cast member of the series.

===Music===
Like &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; and &quot;The Monkees&quot;, Screen Gems made potential hit music an aspect of &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;. Under the supervision of Lester Sill, several foremost composers of the era contributed to series, including Carole Bayer Sager, Howard Greenfield, Jack Keller, Ernie Freeman and Dominic Frontiere. &quot;Sally Field, Star of The Flying Nun&quot;, an LP recording featuring music from the series&#x27; soundtrack sung by Sally Field and the Bob Mitchell Choir, was released by Colgems in 1967. One of the songs from the album, &quot;Felicidad (The Happiness Word)&quot; was released as single and was heard in the pilot episode.

In addition to the album, two additional singles were released by Colgems Records: the soundtrack of Sally Field, Marge Redmond and Madeleine Sherwood of Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley&#x27;s &quot;Gonna Build a Mountain&quot; from the second season episode &quot;Sister Socko in San Tanco&quot; and Sally Field singing &quot;Golden Days&quot;, a song not heard on the series.

In 1968, Abbe Lane guest starred in the second season episode &quot;The Organ Transplant&quot; and performed &quot;The Look of Love&quot; from the feature film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

===Broadcast history===
During its first two seasons, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; aired on Thursday nights at 8:00pm EST, where the series competed in the ratings with &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; on NBC and &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; on CBS. The show was an instant hit, with high ratings and was declared the &quot;hit of the season;&quot; however, the ratings dropped as the season progressed. During its second year, the series was scheduled against &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O.&quot; During its final season, the series was moved to Wednesday nights at 7:30pm EST, scheduled opposite &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.&quot; All of the competing shows ranked higher in the ratings than &quot;The Flying Nun,&quot; which eventually led to its cancellation. During its three-year run, the series was a part of a three-show comedy block on ABC that also consisted of &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;That Girl.&quot; Despite its early popularity, the show&#x27;s ratings never broke the Nielsen top thirty and the final episode aired on April 3, 1970. However, its 83 episodes have consistently attracted new audiences since its initial run.

===Syndication===
Beginning in summer 2011, the show was transmitted on weekends on Antenna TV. The complete first season also became available on iTunes. Beginning in 2018, it began broadcasting on FETV on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 2-4am.

The complete series is also available on Tubi and Amazon Prime streaming services.

==Awards==
Despite the show being an easy target for critics, Marge Redmond was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sister Jacqueline during the 1967–68 season. She lost to Marion Lorne, who won posthumously for her role as &quot;Aunt Clara&quot; on &quot;Bewitched.&quot;

==Novels, comics and toys==
A series of novels, all based on characters and dialog of the series, were written by William Johnston and published by Ace Books in the 1960s. 

*&quot;Miracle at San Tanco&quot; 1968
*&quot;The Littlest Rebels&quot; 1968
*&quot;The Mother of Invention&quot; 1969
*&quot;The Little Green Men&quot; 1969
*&quot;The Underground Picnic &quot; 1969

In addition, the original novel was republished under the name &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;.

Dell Comics published 4 issues of a comic book based on &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; from February to November 1968. View-Master adapted the episode &quot;Love Me, Love My Dog&quot; into a three-reel 3-D packet with a storybook. Milton Bradley released a board game and several puzzles, and coloring books were published by Saalfield. Ray Plastic Inc. also released a rip-cord powered official Flying Nun toy.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; on March 21, 2006, on DVD in Region 1. This was followed by the release of the show&#x27;s second season on DVD on August 15, 2006.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library, including &quot;The Flying Nun.&quot; They re-released the first and second seasons in a 2-season combo pack DVD on October 7, 2014.

As of Fall 2022, the first 3 seasons of &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; were available on Crackle.

<doc id="696199" wikidata="Q776403" url="?curid=696199" title="The Five Star Stories">
<text>is a mecha manga series created by Mamoru Nagano, building on his work on the anime series &quot;Heavy Metal L-Gaim&quot;. The story takes place in a cluster of four major planetary systems, and centers around Amaterasu, the immortal emperor of the Grees Kingdom who is destined to rule the whole Joker System, as well as his bride Lachesis. An anime film adaptation of the first volume, directed by Kazuo Yamazaki, was released in 1989.

==Overview==
&quot;The Five Star Stories&quot; takes its name from the Joker Star Cluster where the stories take place. The star cluster is made up of four stars: Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern. The &quot;fifth star&quot; is a large comet named Stant that passes through that sector of space every 1,500 years pulling with it its own collection of orbiting planets.

In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the &quot;Super Empire&quot;, controlled all four solar systems of the Joker Cluster. They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Cluster. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for &quot;Joker Calendar&quot; and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized.

The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered &quot;fatimas&quot; are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar heads that dominate the battlefields. Warfare between nations is commonplace and few still hope for peace.

Mortar headds are the combat mainstays of the Joker Universe. They are mecha which require superhuman reflexes and skill to control, and are therefore only utilized by headliners with Fatima copilots. Fatimas are humanoid creatures genetically engineered for a life of service on the battlefield. Fatimas are necessary copilots for mortar headds and mentally merge with the computer systems of these devastating machines to control weapons, communications and other vital processes. As such, Fatimas are designed to have computational skills rivaling any computer.

As of the 2013 May issue of Newtype, the setting of FSS has changed to fit the lore of Mamoru Nagano&#x27;s 2012 film Gothicmade. MH (Mortar Headd) has been renamed GTM (GothicMade), while Fatimas have been renamed AF (Automatic Flowers).

===Manga===
Seventeen volumes of manga have been published beginning in 1986 and up until the present.

To date, 26 volumes of the English version have been produced, covering Japanese volumes 1 through 10. Volumes 11 onwards have yet to be translated and the status of future English versions is currently unknown.

The major story arcs of the manga are:

===Film adaptation===
A film adaptation of &quot;The Five Star Stories&quot; covers the events in the first arc of the manga, &quot;Destiny Three Fates: Lachesis&quot;. It was created by Sunrise, directed by Kazuo Yamazaki, produced by Haruki Kadokawa, and premiered in Japan on March 11, 1989. It was re-released in 2002 in DVD format. The licensing rights are currently owned by ADV Films, and an English version was released in March 2005.

==Reception==
According to Oricon, reboots of the first three volumes have all ranked within the top 30 best-selling manga of during their release week: Book I at number 11 selling 31,471 copies, book II at number 23 selling 30,958 copies, and book III at number 15 selling 38,437 copies. The manga had over 8.5 million copies in print as of January 2018.

<text>A lei () is a garland or wreath common in The Pacific Islands of Polynesia and also in Asia (Philippines). More loosely defined, a lei is any series of objects strung together with the intent to be worn. Lei of various styles are given as gifts to honour people throughout the Pacific, being presented, for example, to visiting dignitaries, graduates, or to loved ones who are departing.

Lei gained popularity in the United States due to the common practice of presenting one to arriving or leaving tourists in Hawaii. Sampaguita leis are also used in the Philippines for religious reason, typically worn to their Anito or religious statues.

==Symbolism==
A lei can be given to someone for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, these reasons include peace, love, honor, or friendship. Common events during which leis may be distributed include graduations, weddings, and school dances. Often the composition of a lei determines its significance. A lei made using a hala fruit, for instance, is said to be connected to love, desire, transition, and change.

==Materials==

A &quot;lei&quot; may be composed of a pattern or series of just about anything, but most commonly consists of fresh natural foliage such as flowers, leaves, vines, fern fronds, and seeds. The most commonly used flowers are those of plumerias, tuberose, carnations, orchids, and &quot;pikake&quot;, though &quot;maile&quot; leaves, ferns, and &quot;tī&quot; leaves are extremely popular as well as traditional among &quot;hula&quot; dancers. Other types of &quot;lei&quot; may include sea or land shells, fish teeth, bones, feathers, plastic flowers, fabric, paper (including origami and monetary bills), candy, or anything that can be strung together in a series or pattern and worn as a wreath or a necklace. The Hawaiian island of Niʻihau is famous for its lei made of tiny gem-like shells (&quot;pūpū&quot;).

==Crafting==

The eight most common methods of making &quot;lei&quot; are:

Haku: three-ply braid incorporating additional materials. A method of making a lei by using a base material, such as softened tree bark or long leaves, and braiding it while adding the decorative plant material into each wrap of the braid. Normally used for flowers and foliage with long pliable petioles or stems.

Hili: braid or plait with only one kind of material. Most commonly made from three or more strands of supple vine or fern braided together.

Hilo: twist, double helix, intertwine. A method of making a lei by twisting two strands together to form a &quot;rope&quot;. The popular and simple &quot;lei lāī&quot; (&quot;tī&quot; leaf lei) is made using this method.

Hipuu / nipuu: a method of making a &quot;lei&quot; by knotting the stems of the decorative plant material and stringing the next stem through the knot. It requires a very long stem on the decorative material. Similar to a daisy chain.

Humu / humuhumu: sew to a backing, usually using a basting stitch. A method of making a &quot;lei&quot; by sewing the decorative material to a backing such as &quot;hala&quot;, &quot;lai&quot;, paper, or felt. Each successive row of lei material is overlapped on the previous to create a scale-like effect. Bougainvillea &quot;lei&quot; and feather hat &quot;lei&quot; often are made with this method.

Kui: pierce, piercing stitch. A method of making a &quot;lei&quot; by sewing or piercing the decorative material with a needle and stringing it onto a thread. This is probably the style with which most Westerners are familiar. This method is commonly used to string flowers such as plumeria, rose, carnation, etc.

Wili: wind, twist, crank, coil. A corkscrew-type twist, as found in a pig&#x27;s tail and the seed pod of the &quot;wiliwili&quot; tree. A method of making a &quot;lei&quot; by winding fiber around successive short lengths of the decorative material. Sometimes base materials such as &quot;hala&quot;, &quot;lai&quot;, strands of raffia, or even strips of paper are used to make wrapping easier.

Haku mele: to braid a song. A song composed out of affection for an individual is considered a &quot;lei&quot;.

&quot;Lei&quot; may be open or closed, depending on circumstance.

These leis are traditionally constructed using natural foliage.

==Historical context==
Leis were originally worn by ancient Polynesians and some Asian people as part of custom. They were often used by Native Hawaiians to signify their ranks and royalty. They are also worn as a form of honor to each other and their gods. The religion of the Native Hawaiians as well as the hula custom is tied into the leis that they wore. 

Native Hawaiians, who are Polynesian, brought the tradition of lei making and wearing with them to the Hawaiian islands when they arrived. On the first of every May, an event called Lei Day is celebrated to honor the act of lei making and the custom surrounding it.

==Customs==
There are many customs and protocols associated with the giving, receiving, wearing, storing, and disposing of lei. A story that originated during World War II tells of a hula dancer who dared to give a lei to a US soldier along with a kiss, leading it to become a tradition of lei distribution in modern times. To this day, leis remain a notable aspect of Hawaiian culture. Traditionalists give a lei by bowing slightly and raising it above the heart, allowing the recipient to take it, as raising the hands above another&#x27;s head, or touching the face or head, is considered disrespectful. 

By tradition, only open lei are given to a pregnant or nursing woman. If due to allergies or other reasons a person cannot wear a lei which has just been given (for instance a musician who would tangle the lei in their guitar strap), the lei is displayed in a place of honor, such as the musician&#x27;s music stand or microphone stand. Lei should never be thrown away casually, or tossed into the trash. 

Traditionally they should be returned to the place they were gathered, or if that is not possible, they should be returned to the earth by hanging in a tree, burying, or burning. A lei represents love, and to throw one away represents throwing away the love of the giver. Many types of lei can be left in a window to dry, allowing the natural fragrance to fill the room. This technique is often used in cars as well.

===Polynesia===
In Polynesian cultures, a lei is something that is created by someone and given to another with the intent to decorate that person for an emotional reason—usually as a sign of affection. Common reasons include greeting, farewell, affection or love, friendship, appreciation, congratulation, recognition, or to otherwise draw attention to the recipient. In Samoa, similar garlands fashioned of entire flowers, buds, seeds, nuts, plant fibers, leaves, ferns, seashells, or flower petals are called &quot;asoa&quot; or &quot;ula&quot;, while single flowers or clusters worn in the hair or on the ear are called &quot;sei&quot;. In Tahiti such garlands are referred to as &quot;hei&quot; and in the Cook Islands they are called an &quot;ei&quot;. 

Tongans are known for creating unique &quot;kahoa&quot; leis made of chains of flat, crescent or triangular arrangements made of flower petals and leaves sewn onto a leaf or cloth backing. In Niue the iconic lei is the kahoa hihi which made from strings of tiny, distinctively yellow snail (hihi) shells. Many modern Polynesian celebrations include the giving and receiving of leis in various forms, including recent adaptations of the flower/plant lei in which candy, folded currency bills, rolls of coinage, and even spam musubi are tied into garlands. &quot;Non-traditional&quot; materials such as cloth ribbon, sequins, cellophane wrap, curling ribbon, and yarn are often used to fashion leis in various forms today.

=== Hawaii ===

Among residents of Hawaii, the most popular occasions at which nā lei can be found are birthdays, graduations, weddings, funerals, retirement parties, and bridal showers. It is not uncommon for a high school or college graduate to be seen wearing so many nā lei that they reach their ears or higher.

On May 1 each year, Hawaiians celebrate &quot;Lei Day&quot;, first conceived in 1927 by poet Don Blanding. At the time, Blanding was employed by the &quot;Honolulu Star Bulletin&quot;, and he shared his idea with columnist Grace Tower Warren, who came up with the phrase, &quot;May Day is Lei Day&quot;. The Hawaiian song, &quot;May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii&quot; was composed in 1927 by Ruth and Leonard &quot;Red&quot; Hawk.

At the 81st Annual Mayor&#x27;s Lei Day Celebration at Kapiolani Park in 2008, Honolulu set the record for the World&#x27;s Longest Lei. Unofficially, the lei measured in length, more than a mile.

Notable Hawaiian artisans of feather lei (lei hulu) making include Mary Louise Kekuewa, and Johanna Drew Cluney.

All of the major islands celebrate Lei Day, and each island is symbolized in pageantry by a specific type of lei and a color.

* Hawaii: red, ōhia lehua (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;)
* Maui: pink, lokelani (&quot;Rosa damascena&quot;)
* Kahoolawe: gray or silver, hinahina (&quot;Heliotropium anomalum&quot; var. &quot;argentum&quot;)
* Lānai: orange, kaunaoa (&quot;Cuscuta sandwichiana&quot;)
* Oahu: yellow or gold, ilima (&quot;Sida fallax&quot;)
* Molokai: green, kukui (&quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;)
* Kauai: purple, mokihana (&quot;Melicope anisata&quot;)
* Niihau: white, pūpū o Niihau (Niihau shells)

===Philippines===

The old custom for welcoming guests in the Philippines is by giving a flower necklace made of sampaguita, the country&#x27;s national flower. However, in the recent years, more affordable options has emerged. This became popular over time as fresh flowers are hard to maintain especially during long events. One of the popular modern option are rosette leis, it is made of Brocade cut into necklace of various designs and a center piece flower petals made of satin ribbon.

<doc id="696209" wikidata="Q2777377" url="?curid=696209" title="The City (1939 film)">
<text>The City is a pioneering short documentary film from 1939 that contrasts the problems of the contemporary urban environment with the superior social and physical conditions that can be provided in a planned community. It was directed and photographed by Ralph Steiner and Willard Van Dyke based on a treatment by Lewis Mumford, which was in turn based on an outline by Pare Lorentz. Aaron Copland wrote the musical score, and Morris Carnovsky provided the narration.

==Summary==
The film follows a historical sequence and uses the following locations:
#In the Beginning – New England (a rural 18th-Century community)
#The Industrial City (Pittsburgh)
#The Metropolis – Men into Steel (Manhattan)
#The Highway – The Endless City (Sunday traffic congestion in New York and New Jersey)
#The Green City (Greenbelt, Maryland, and Radburn, New Jersey)
Greenbelt, Maryland, had been constructed a few years earlier as a New Deal project.

Length: 43 minutes and 43 seconds

==Production==
The film was the idea of Catherine Bauer, an urban planner and public housing advocate. It was produced for the American Institute of Planners (predecessor of the APA) to be shown at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair as part of the &quot;City of Tomorrow&quot; exhibit. Bauer&#x27;s original idea was to commission a full-scale mini-neighborhood on a site to showcase innovative housing design and community planning. This was to be done in conjunction with MoMA. When the plan was dropped for lack of time and resources, Bauer came up with the idea of the film. Robert Kohn agreed and commissioned it. At the end of 1937, Henwar Rodakiewicz moved to New York to assist Steiner in the production, including participating in writing and editing.

==Soundtrack==
The score, for narrator and orchestra, was written by Aaron Copland and conducted by Max Goberman. The narrator was the New York stage and Hollywood film actor Morris Carnovsky. Writing in the &quot;New York Times &quot; in 2000, Anthony Tommasini described the score as &quot;by turns beguiling and trenchant.&quot; In &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Mark Swed has called &quot;The City&quot;&#x27;s score &quot;an astonishing missing link not only in the genesis of Copland’s Americana style but in American music and cinema.&quot; The complete musical score, without narration, was recorded by the PostClassical Ensemble and was issued on CD in 2022.

This was the first of eight movie scores that Copland would write throughout his career. In 1942, he assembled a five-song suite for small orchestra, consisting of excerpts from his first three film scores, entitled &quot;Music for Movies,&quot; which included the compositions &quot;New England Countryside&quot; and &quot;Sunday Traffic&quot; from &quot;The City&quot;.

The title of this piece is not to be confused with &quot;Quiet City&quot;, the 1940 work by Aaron Copland, nor with his 1964 orchestral work &quot;Music for a Great City&quot;.

==Legacy==
The film was well received when shown at the fair. One study of the fair summarized the film&#x27;s reception:
In 1998, &quot;The City&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

The planned community envisioned in the film— with its attention to scale and shared green space—is sometimes confused by later viewers as representative of suburban development, which was not envisioned when the film was made.

<text>The trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator) is a species of swan found in North America. The heaviest living bird native to North America, it is also the largest extant species of waterfowl, with a wingspan of 185 to 304.8 cm (6 ft 2 in to 10 ft 2 in). It is the American counterpart and a close relative of the whooper swan (&quot;Cygnus cygnus&quot;) of Eurasia, and even has been considered the same species by some authorities. By 1933, fewer than 70 wild individuals were known to exist; extinction seemed imminent until aerial surveys discovered a Pacific population of several thousand trumpeter swans around Alaska&#x27;s Copper River. Careful reintroductions by wildlife agencies and the Trumpeter Swan Society gradually restored the North American wild population to over 46,000 birds by 2010.

==Taxonomy==
The trumpeter swan was formally described in 1831 by the Scottish naturalist John Richardson in the fourth volume of &quot;American Ornithology; or, The Natural History of Birds Inhabiting the United States&quot; by Alexander Wilson and Charles Bonaparte. Richardson coined the current binomial name &quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;. A description by Richardson was also published in &quot;Fauna Boreali-Americana, or, The Zoology of the Northern Parts of British America&quot; by William Swainson and Richardson. Although the volume has 1831 printed on the title page, it was in fact not published until 1832. The etymology of the species name, &quot;buccinator&quot;, comes from the word &quot;bucina,&quot; a specific type of military trumpet. The trumpeter swan is monotypic, meaning that no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The trumpeter swan is the largest extant species of waterfowl, and both the heaviest and longest native bird of North America. Adults usually measure long, though large males can exceed in total length. The weight of adult birds is typically . Possibly due to seasonal variation based on food access and variability due to age, average weights in males have been reported to range from and from in females.

It is one of the heaviest living birds or animals capable of flight, and, in terms of average mass, the heaviest flying bird in the world. Alongside the mute swan (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;), Dalmatian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus crispus&quot;), kori bustard (&quot;Ardeotis kori&quot;), and Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;), it is one of a handful to weigh in excess of between the sexes, and one survey of wintering trumpeters found it averaged second only to the condor in mean mass. The trumpeter swan&#x27;s wingspan ranges from , with the wing chord measuring . The largest known male trumpeter attained a length of , a wingspan of and a weight of . It is the second heaviest wild waterfowl ever found, as one mute swan was found to weigh a massive , but it was unclear whether the latter swan was still capable of flight because of its bulk.

Adult plumage is entirely white. Like mute swan cygnets, trumpeter swan cygnets have light grey plumage and pinkish legs, gaining their white plumage after about a year. As with the whooper swan, this species has an upright posture and generally swims with a straight neck. The trumpeter swan has a large, wedge-shaped black bill that can be minimally lined with salmon-pink coloration around the mouth. The bill measures , up to twice the length of a Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) bill; the trumpeter swan bill is the largest of any waterfowl species in the world. The legs are gray-pink in color, though in some birds can appear yellowish gray to even black. The tarsus measures .

The mute swan, introduced to North America, is scarcely smaller. However, it can easily be distinguished by its orange bill and different physical structure (particularly the neck, which is typically held curved as opposed to straight in the trumpeter). The mute swan is often found year-around in developed areas near human habitation in North America, whereas trumpeters are usually only found in pristine wetlands with minimal human disturbance, especially while breeding. The tundra swan (&quot;C. columbianus&quot;) more closely resembles the trumpeter, but is significantly smaller. The neck of a male trumpeter may be twice as long as the neck of a tundra swan. The tundra swan can be further distinguished by its yellow lores. However, some trumpeter swans have yellow lores; many of these individuals appear to be leucistic and have paler legs than typical trumpeters. Distinguishing tundra and trumpeter swans from a distance (when size is harder to gauge) can be challenging without direct comparison but it is possible thanks to the trumpeter&#x27;s obviously longer neck (the great length of which is apparent even when the swan is not standing or swimming upright) and larger, wedge-shaped bill as compared to the tundra swan.

Trumpeter swans have similar calls to whooper swans and Bewick&#x27;s swans. They are loud and somewhat musical creatures, with their cry sounding similar to a trumpet, which gave the bird its name.

==Range and habitat==
Cooperative continental surveys of trumpeter swans have been performed regularly, beginning in 1968, repeated in 1975, and then conducted at 5-year intervals. The most recent survey of trumpeter swans occurred in 2015. The survey assesses trumpeter swan abundance and productivity throughout the entire breeding ranges of the three recognized North American populations: the Pacific Coast (PCP), Rocky Mountain (RMP), and Interior (IP) populations (see Figure). From 1968 to 2010 the population has increased from 3,722 to approximately 46,225 birds, in large part due to re-introductions to the species&#x27; historic range.

The breeding habitat of trumpeter swans includes large and shallow ponds, undisturbed lakes, pristine wetlands, wide and slow rivers, and marshes in northwestern and central North America. The largest numbers of breeding pairs are found in Alaska. Trumpeter swans prefer nesting sites with enough surface water for them to have space to take off, as well as accessible and reliable food sources, shallow, unpolluted water, and little to no human disturbance. Natural populations migrate in V-shaped flocks to and from the Pacific coast and portions of the United States. Released populations are mostly non-migratory.

In the winter, trumpeter swans migrate to the southern tier of Canada, the eastern part of the northwest United States (especially to the Red Rock Lakes area of Montana), and the northern area of the Puget Sound region of Washington state; migratory populations have even been observed as far south as Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Historically, the range of trumpeter swans extended as far south as Texas and southern California. Since 1992, trumpeter swans have also been found in Arkansas each November–February on Magness Lake, outside of Heber Springs. In addition, the collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, includes a specimen that was shot by F. B. Armstrong in 1909 at Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. &quot;C. buccinator&quot; is currently considered extirpated from Mexico. In early 2017, a juvenile trumpeter swan took up residence in the French Broad River in Asheville, North Carolina, marking the first such sighting in that part of the state.

Non-migratory trumpeter swans have also been artificially introduced to some areas of Oregon. Largely due to their natural beauty, they are suitable waterfowl to attract bird watchers and other wildlife enthusiasts. Introductions of non-indigenous species in the Western states, for example through the Oregon Trumpeter Swan Program (OTSP), have also been met with criticism, but the introduction program argues that the perceived attractiveness of natural sites has priority over the original range of any given species.

Occasional sightings of trumpeter swans have occurred in the United Kingdom; while some of these are believed to be vagrants, most are presumed escapes into the wild. A single instance of the species breeding in the United Kingdom is reported from 1997, where two swans out of a group that escaped from a wildfowl collection at Apethorpe Palace, Northamptonshire raised a single cygnet on the River Nene.

==Diet==

These birds feed while swimming, sometimes up-ending or dabbling in reaching submerged food. The diet is almost entirely aquatic plants and occasionally insects. They will eat both the leaves and stems of submerged and emergent vegetation. They will also dig into muddy substrates underwater to extract roots and tubers. In winter, they may also eat grasses and grains in fields. They will often feed at night as well as by day. Feeding activity, and the birds&#x27; weights, often peak in the spring as they prepare for the breeding season. The young initially include insects, small fish, fish eggs and small crustaceans in their diet, providing additional protein, and change to a vegetation-based diet over the first few months.

==Predators and mortality==

Predators of trumpeter swan eggs include common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), common raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), wolverines (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), grizzly bears (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;), coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), pumas (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), and North American river otters (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;). Nest location can provide partial protection from most mammalian nest predators, especially if placed on islands or floating vegetation in deep waters. Most of the same predators will prey on young cygnets, as well as common snapping turtles (&quot;Chelhydra serpentina&quot;), California gulls (&quot;Larus californicus&quot;), great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;). Larger cygnets and, rarely, nesting adults may be ambushed by golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), and probably coyotes, wolves and pumas.

When their eggs and young are threatened, the parents can be quite aggressive, initially displaying with head bobbing and hissing. If this is not sufficient, the adults will physically combat the predator, battering with their powerful wings. Adults have managed to beat predators equal to their own weight such as coyotes in confrontations. Predation of adults, when they are not nesting, is extremely rare; golden and bald eagles, and coyotes can pose a threat, but substantiated cases are very few. Photos of an exceptional attack by a bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) on an adult trumpeter swan in flight were taken in 2008, although the swan survived the predation attempt. In another case, a coyote succeeded in killing an injured adult trumpeter swan.

In captivity, members of this species have survived to 33 years old and, in the wild, have lived to at least 24 years. Young trumpeter swans may have as little as 40% chance of survival due variously to disturbance and destruction by humans, predation, nest flooding, and starvation. In some areas, though, the breeding success rate is considerably greater and, occasionally, all cygnets may reach maturity. Mortality in adults is quite low, with the survival rate usually being 80–100% annually, unless they are hunted by humans.

== Breeding behaviour ==

=== Courtship and mate choice behaviours ===
Like other swans, trumpeter swans often mate for life, and both parents participate in raising their young, but primarily the female incubates the eggs. Most pair bonds are formed when swans are 5 to 7 years old, although some pairs do not form until they are nearly 20 years old. &quot;Divorces&quot; have been known between birds, in which case the mates will be serially monogamous, with mates in differing breeding seasons. Occasionally, if his mate dies, a male trumpeter swan may not pair again for the rest of his life.

In late April, breeding pairs meet to begin the process of constructing a nest, which can take 11 to 35 days. Before this grueling process can come to be, much like many other species of birds, these creatures undergo several courtship rituals. Trumpeter swans have a strong tendency to avoid interactions with conspecifics, therefore it is implied that at first contact of a potential mating pair there is some unwillingness in the male and female to make this connection.

In order to overcome the initial encounter, two common displays can occur. At first, the male tends to pursue the female in a non-aggressive way. When the female allows the approach, the male will touch the breast of its body to the flank of the female which then causes both individuals to touch the breasts of their bodies together. At this point the feathers on the neck of the male are stood up and the bills of the mating pair are pointed down indicating pacification. Another act of courtship occurs when a male swims in the direction of a possible mate and continuously turns its head from side to side to get the attention or perhaps impress the female. Other common behavioral displays presented by the pair include spreading and raising their wings, the rapid or almost quivering motion of the wings, particular head motions that include bobbing, and finally the most known (and what the name of this animal originates) is the trumpeting that occurs.

Acoustic communication among trumpeter swans is very common among all ages of the species. From the young cygnets to the adult swans, their calls are very distinct and have a wide variety of functions in the survival of the animal. The classic trumpet call can be heard from long distances and is the most common communication mechanism heard among these birds. This type of call resembles a horn because the frequency can vary greatly. This call generally occurs when an animal is alarmed or feels threatened, the call acts as a warning or even a way in deterring incoming predators due to the abrupt volume of the noise being evoked. More specifically referring to mating, the call that is most common among mating pairs is called the duet. This call happens when a pair has come together near breeding season. The duetting process can begin as separate trumpeting solos and can evolve into an almost simultaneous duet that is very similar in frequency and very difficult to tell the individual calls apart.

This performance of the pair is commonly associated with the particular movements mentioned above (head bobbing and wing movements) associated with the courtship. Also, the duet can aid in the coordination of a dual attack on a predator that is too close to the nest of a mated pair. In terms of mate choice, the trumpeter swan continually returns to the mate from previous breeding terms. Often the breeding pair will even return to their previous breeding grounds if the previous offspring were successful in that area.

Though the range of the two species does not overlap, the trumpeter swan can hybridize with its close relative, the whooper swan (&quot;Cygnus cygnus&quot;), and hybrid birds have been observed in the wild, most likely as a result of interbreeding between wild trumpeter and vagrant or introduced whooper swans.

=== Nesting and incubation behaviour ===

The fabrication of a nest is an incredibly precise process that takes place over a series of 11 to 35 days and typically breeding pairs will begin construction in late April. The time of year the nest-building process begins can slightly vary due to weather conditions in the previous year; if the environment was colder and wet the females may not be healthy enough to be mating right away and as a result, the nesting behavior might be slightly delayed. It is common to find nests of trumpeter swans surrounded by water or close to water. This is advantageous to the parents because it can reduce the risk of predation, provide optimal foraging sources such as aquatic vegetation, as well as ensure there is nearby water for when the cygnets are hatched.

The long duration of the nest building process is predominantly due to the nest being so large (1.2 to 3.6m in diameter) and fabricated mainly from submerged vegetation as well as grasses and grass-like plants. It has been observed that adult trumpeter swans do not directly bring the building materials directly to the nest building site. The males use a specific action that includes facing away from the nest and throwing organic materials over their shoulder moving closer and closer to the nesting area. Eventually when they arrive at the nesting site the mating pair are both involved in the construction, but, as mentioned above the male spends the majority of his time doing the construction. During nest construction, female trumpeter swans feed significantly more frequently than males in order to fuel up for laying the eggs. This is greatly supported by the male counterpart of the species because ultimately if the female is keeping herself healthy it will, in the end, ensure healthy offspring which improves the fitness of the mating pair.

Typically a female trumpeter swan will lay four to six eggs and will incubate them for 32 to 37 days until they hatch. The eggs average wide, long, and weigh about . The eggs are quite possibly the largest of any flying bird alive today; in comparison they are about 20% larger in dimensions and mass than those of an Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;), which attains similar average adult weights, and more than twice as heavy as those of kori bustards (&quot;Ardeotis kori&quot;).

After the eggs are laid it is the female that spends the majority of the time incubating. It has been observed that around every 20 minutes the female will stand up from incubating and reach down beneath herself to roll over the eggs with her bill before re-assuming the incubation position. It can be inferred that this behaviour is used to ensure the eggs are kept an appropriate temperature on all sides; this is crucial because exposure to the elements leads to high mortality rates in cygnets. The female only leaves the incubation process for brief recesses that last around 20 minutes. Before she leaves, she will cover the eggs with plant material. It has been observed that if the female does not cover the eggs the male will do so in her absence. This time away from the nest is primarily used for feeding, but the female has also been observed using this time for bathing and preening.

The only other time the female leaves the nest is when she must help the male chase away predators from their nesting territory. It is rare for both members of a mating pair to be absent from the nest at the same time, and there is generally always a male or a female present guarding the eggs. The behavior of the male during and after the laying of the eggs can be best described as on alert. This is due to males being increasingly territorial and aggressive, particularly when a predator or conspecifics approach the nesting area. Generally when females leave the nest during their brief recesses the males will stand and guard the eggs, although in some cases the males would even sit on the eggs in the absence of a female swan.

=== Parental behaviour ===
==== Males ====
After the meeting of the pair prior to mating or nest building, the male will often initiate courting calls which result in the duet mentioned above. Before and throughout the laying period, the male can be found dealing with the construction of the nest and collection of resources. As the eggs are being incubated by the female the male does not feed or sleep as often particularly when the female left the nest. These trends also were associated with more aggressive behaviors from the male, especially towards predators and other members of the species.

When it comes to parental behaviour, the male has already completed the majority of his role. With this in mind, he does continue to be territorial and protective of the newly developing cygnets as well as allowing the female to replenish her nutrient reserves. This makes migration to wintering grounds possible and allows for more years of breeding. Keeping the female of the mating pair healthy is important for trumpeter swans because this species tends to only have one mate in its lifetime. A healthy female also improves the likelihood of having more successful clutches as well as better nesting experiences. When cygnets are young it is common to see the male accompanying them in feeding recesses outside the nest. This can fall under the category of the main male role in parenting being the protection of the offspring.

==== Females ====
The increased care and attention of the male to the young allows for the female to feed more frequently and exert more energy toward the protection and overall health of the developing cygnets. During the pre-laying/laying period the males are significantly more active than the females of the breeding pair. This is advantageous because it aids in the fitness of the species by improving reproductive success by allowing the female, as mentioned above, to feed more frequently and replenish the energy stored in order to aid in incubation and other crucial activities. When hatching occurs the females tend to not leave the nest. The only time she may leave would be to chase away a nearby predator.

After hatching the cygnets are brooded for the first one to two days by the female. Cygnets are also brooded when needed (when it is cold or at night) for the first few weeks of their lives. Young cygnets have a very close relationship with their parents in the first part of their lives, spending most of their first few weeks with the female in the nest or in the water. The young are able to swim within two days and usually are capable of feeding themselves after at most two weeks. The fledging stage is reached at roughly 3 to 4 months. Fledglings tend to spend their first full winter with their parents and then they no longer need them.

==Conservation status==

===Near extinction and rediscovery in Alaska===
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the trumpeter swan was hunted heavily, for game or meat, for the soft swanskins used in powder puffs, and for their quills and feathers. This species is also unusually sensitive to lead poisoning from ingesting discarded lead shot from fishing weights while young. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company captured thousands of swans annually with a total of 17,671 swans killed between 1853 and 1877. In 1908 Edward Preble wrote of the decline in the hunt with the number sold annually dropping from 1,312 in 1854 to 122 in 1877.

Sir John Richardson wrote in 1831 that the trumpeter &quot;is the most common Swan in the interior of the fur-counties. ... It is to the trumpeter that the bulk of the Swan-skins imported by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company belong.&quot; By the early twentieth century breeding trumpeter swans were nearly extirpated in the United States, with a remnant population of fewer than 70 wild trumpeters in remote hot springs in or near Yellowstone National Park. Surprising news came from a 1950s aerial survey of Alaska&#x27;s Copper River when several thousand trumpeters were discovered. This population provided critical genetic stock to complement the tri-state (Montana/Idaho/Wyoming) population for re-introductions in other parts of the swan&#x27;s historic range.

===Historical range===
In 1918 Joseph Grinnell wrote that trumpeter swans once bred in North America from northwestern Indiana west to Oregon in the U.S., and in Canada from James Bay to the Yukon, and they migrated as far south as Texas and southern California. In 1960 Winston E. Banko also placed their breeding range as far south as Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, northwestern Indiana, but in Michigan turned this line northwards, placing a hypothetical eastern boundary up through Ontario to western Quebec and the eastern shore of James Bay.

In 1984, Harry G. Lumsden posited that trumpeter swans may have been extirpated from eastern Canada by native people armed with firearms prior to the arrival of European explorers and noted archaeological remains of trumpeter swans as far east as Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to 2,000 BCE. He cited historical observer records of what must have been breeding trumpeters, such as Father Hennepin&#x27;s August report of swans on the Detroit River from Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie in 1679 and Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac&#x27;s 1701 report of summering swans (July 23 – October 8) in the same area: &quot;There are such large numbers of swans that the rushes among which they are massed might be taken for lilies.&quot; In the eastern United States the breeding range is potentially extended to North Carolina by the detailed report of John Lawson (1701) that &quot;Of the swans we have two sorts, the one we call Trompeters...These are the largest sort we have...when spring comes on they go the Lakes to breed&quot; versus &quot;The sort of Swans called Hoopers; are the least.&quot;

===Reintroduction===
Early efforts to reintroduce this bird into other parts of its original range, and to introduce it elsewhere, have had modest success, as suitable habitats have dwindled and the released birds do not undertake migrations. More recently, the population in all three major population regions have shown sustained growth over the past thirty-year period. Data from the US Fish and Wildlife Service show 400% growth in that period, with signs of increasing growth rates over time.

One impediment to the growth of the trumpeter swan population around the Great Lakes is the presence of a growing non-native mute swan population who compete for habitat.

===Alberta===
One of the largest conservation sites for the trumpeter swan is located in Lois Hole Provincial Park. It is located adjacent to the renamed Trumpeter subdivision of Edmonton, Alberta, within Big Lake.

===Idaho===
Thousands of swans migrate through the Chain Lakes along the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River basin in the Idaho Panhandle. Due to historic mining in the area, an average of 52 swans died each year 2005–2021 from lead exposure. There is an effort by local foundations, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to clean up the area and help limit lead exposure of swans migrating through.

===Michigan===
Joe Johnson, a biologist for the W.K. Kellogg Bird Sanctuary, part of Michigan State University’s Kellogg Biological Station, obtained trumpeter swans from Alaska for re-introduction to Michigan beginning in 1986. The population has grown via continued re-introductions and organic growth to 756 birds by 2015. The native swans have benefited from removal of non-native mute swans by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources beginning in the 1960s, with a decline from 15,000 mute swans in 2010 to 8,700 in 2015.

===Minnesota===
As of 2013, the trumpeter swan is no longer listed as threatened in the state of Minnesota. In the winter months, a large population of trumpeter swans can be seen in the city of Monticello, Minnesota.

===Ontario===
The Ontario Trumpeter Swan Restoration Group started a conservation project in 1982, using eggs collected in the wild. Live birds have also been taken from the wild. Since then, 584 birds have been released in Ontario. Despite lead poisoning in the wild from shotgun pellets, the prospects for restoration are considered optimistic. As of 2021, the population was between 2500 and 3000, was stable, and no longer relied on rehabilitation facilities.

===Yellowstone National Park===
Yellowstone provides only marginal habitat for trumpeter swans and therefore may be limited to occasional residents and wintering migrants. As of 2019, 27 trumpeter swans were observed in the park, 21 adults and 7 cygnets. Scientists attribute the decline in the park&#x27;s population to the loss of nests and nesting sites because of spring flooding caused by climate change. In 2019, 4 young swans were released in Hayden Valley, and 35 cygnets have been released over 7 years, though none of these cygnets have since nested in the park.

<text>Edward Miner Gallaudet ( ; February 5, 1837 – September 26, 1917), was the first president of Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. (then known as the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and Blind from 1864 until 1894 and then Gallaudet College from 1894 to 1986) from 1864 to 1910.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edward Miner Gallaudet was the son of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Sophia Fowler Gallaudet. While Edward was hearing, his mother Sophia was born deaf. As a youth, Edward enjoyed working with tools and also built an electrical machine. He kept birds, fowl, and rabbits, spending most of his time in the city, but occasionally venturing into the country. 

His father co-founded the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in 1817, where American Sign Language emerged as a language. Edward had fond memories of climbing a hill with his father and his father introducing the subject of geometry to him. In 1851, when Edward was 14 and a recent graduate from Hartford High School in Hartford, Connecticut, his father died.

===Career===
Gallaudet worked at a bank for three years. However, he disliked the &quot;narrowing effect&quot; of the mental monotony of the work, and quit to go to work as a teacher at the school his father founded, He worked there two years, from 1855 to 1857. 

While he was teaching, he continued his education at Trinity College in Hartford, completing his studies for a Bachelor of Science degree two years later.

Gallaudet was a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and served as the District Society&#x27;s president from 1897 to 1899.

===Family===
Edson Fessenden Gallaudet, who was Gallaudet&#x27;s fifth child (and second child with his second wife Susan) was an early pioneer in the field of aviation, being the first to experiment with wing warping, and the founder of the first aircraft factory in America.

==Gallaudet University==

In 1857, Amos Kendall donated of land for the establishment of a school for the deaf and blind in Washington, D.C., and asked Gallaudet to come to Washington to help lead this school. Edward agreed and became the first principal of the Columbia Institution for the Deaf.

In 1864, Gallaudet sought college status for the Columbia Institution and got it when President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill into law which authorized the Columbia Institution to confer college degrees—a law which was not strictly necessary, but which Gallaudet desired. This first college of the deaf eventually became Gallaudet University.

Gallaudet was the president of Gallaudet College/Columbia for 46 years (1864–1910), was the head administrator for 53 years (1857–1910), and was the president of the board of directors for 47 years (1864–1911). He was a staunch advocate of sign language. He recognized the value of speech training, but also recognized that speech training was not for everyone. Although he initially preferred manualism, stating that sign language was the &quot;natural language of deaf people&quot;, throughout his life he came to believe that students should be educated using whichever method fit their specific needs—which could include speech training. He concluded, &quot;no one method is suited to the conditions of all the deaf&quot;. Still, he sometimes referred to oralism as the &quot;artificial method&quot; and deemed that it was only a &quot;partial success&quot;.

==Death==

After retiring as president of Gallaudet College, Gallaudet returned to Hartford, and died on September 26, 1917.

==Awards and recognition==

Gallaudet was awarded honorary degrees by Trinity College in 1859 (M.A.) and 1869 (LL.D.), the Columbian University (later George Washington University) also in 1869 (Ph.D.), and Yale University in 1895 (LL.D.).

A statue commemorating Gallaudet&#x27;s life and works resides on the campus of Gallaudet University, which was sculpted by Pietro Lazzari.

<text>Peter Pett (6 August 1610 – 1672) was an English Master Shipwright and Second Resident Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard. He protected his scale models and drawings of the King&#x27;s Fleet during the Dutch Raid on the Medway, in Kent in June 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, which was otherwise disastrous to the British Royal Navy.

==Life==
Pett was the son of the King&#x27;s Master Shipwright Captain Phineas Pett. He was introduced to King Charles I of England in 1634 and was ordered to construct a new Third Rate ship of 500 tons at Woolwich Dockyard, to be named &quot;Leopard&quot;. With the construction of the &quot;Leopard&quot; underway, Charles decided that he would have a ship built larger and more ornate than any of her predecessors.

In June 1634 while at Woolwich and on the &quot;Leopard&quot; with the king, Phineas Pett, Peter&#x27;s father, related: &quot;His Highness, calling me aside, privately acquainted me of his princely resolution for the building of a great new ship, which he would have me undertake...&quot;

Peter Pett built &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; at Woolwich Dockyard, from the plans made by his father.

One of the largest in the world at that time, the &quot;Sovereign&quot; was a ship of 1,637 tons and was launched on 12 October 1637, after about two years in construction.

John Evelyn wrote in his &quot;Diary&quot; on 19 July 1641 &quot;We rode to Rochester and Chatham to see the Soveraigne, a monstrous vessel so called, being for burthen, defence, and ornament, the richest that ever spread cloth before the wind. She carried 100 brass cannon, and was 1,600 tons, a rare sailer, the work of the famous Phineas Pett.&quot;

==Commissioner Pett==
Pett became Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard in 1648. Despite his contracts from the King, Peter Pett sided with Parliament during the English Civil War and was consequently retained as Commissioner at Chatham Dockyard during the Commonwealth (1649–60).

Pett was the only member of the group of Commonwealth Commissioners who governed the Navy with any technical knowledge of shipbuilding, and responsibility for the designs of most new ships rested principally upon him. He became a Justice of the Peace by 1649. In 1659 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochester in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Rochester in 1660 for the Convention Parliament.

Determined to survive the rigours of the nation&#x27;s political upheavals, Pett, with great resourcefulness, having withheld Chatham from Charles I, was afterwards in Holland preparing the fleet to accompany the return of Charles II. The success of these efforts established for Pett a firm relationship with the King.

In 1667 Pett was blamed for the insufficient protection of the British fleet at Chatham, the charge being that he failed to tow the most capital ships higher up the river. Modern historians argue that it is doubtful whether this would have protected them, the Dutch being powerful enough to advance a few miles more, and that Pett did not have enough manpower anyway. Asked during the official investigation why he had brought his ship models into safety but not the ships themselves, he answered that the former were more valuable, much to the incredulous laughter of his accusers. Pett&#x27;s view was that without the models it was impossible to build new ships, as it was not then feasible to build from drawings alone. Pett was fined and dismissed. He was seen to be a scapegoat for the incompetence of higher-ranking officers, as shown in part of Andrew Marvell&#x27;s satirical poem:

Pett&#x27;s will was proved on 2 December 1672, and it revealed that he had enough worldly goods to be able to live in comfort after his dismissal as Commissioner. For example, in his will there was mentioned a necklace containing over 270 pearls. Being Lord of the Manors of Woodbridge Ufford and Kettle Ufford in Suffolk indicates that he remained possessed of some wealth.

==Pett dynasty==
Some confusion may arise between the identities of Peter Pett and his many relatives; even the Navy Board had difficulty in keeping its records straight on this matter.

From probably before the time that John Pett, (son of Thomas) was paid for caulking the &quot;Regent&quot; in 1499, the Petts have been mistaken, one for the other. Often this was the case with Peter Pett. The first of that name was a Master Shipwright at Deptford in the late 16th century, who built a number of English warships and other vessels from the 1570s onwards. The next Peter Pett, two generations later, was also a Master Shipwright at Deptford, who died in 1652. That Peter had two sons, Sir Peter, the Advocate General for Ireland and Sir Phineas Pett, Master Shipwright at Chatham, who was knighted in 1680, and who was the Comptroller of Stores, and resident Commissioner at Chatham, and who is further to be distinguished from the Commissioner Peter Pett&#x27;s brother Phineas, a clerk of the check at Chatham.

Three other Petts named Phineas were at the same time in the Naval Service at Chatham or in the Thames, one of whom was killed in action in 1666 whilst in command of the &quot;Tyger&quot;, this being a brother of the 2nd Commissioner at Chatham.

<text>Interventional cardiology is a branch of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. Andreas Gruentzig is considered the father of interventional cardiology after the development of angioplasty by interventional radiologist Charles Dotter.

Many procedures can be performed on the heart by catheterization. This most commonly involves the insertion of a sheath into the femoral artery (but, in practice, any large peripheral artery or vein) and cannulating the heart under X-ray visualization (most commonly fluoroscopy). The radial artery may also be used for cannulation; this approach offers several advantages, including the accessibility of the artery in most patients, the easy control of bleeding even in anticoagulated patients, the enhancement of comfort because patients are capable of sitting up and walking immediately following the procedure, and the near absence of clinically significant sequelae in patients with a normal Allen test. Downsides to this approach include spasm of the artery and pain, inability to use larger catheters needed in some procedures, and more radiation exposure. But, in recent times radial approach is getting popularity due to its patient comfort after procedure.

The main advantages of using the interventional cardiology or radiology approach are the avoidance of the scars and pain, and long post-operative recovery. Additionally, interventional cardiology procedure of primary angioplasty is now the gold standard of care for an acute myocardial infarction. It involves the extraction of clots from occluded coronary arteries and deployment of stents and balloons through a small hole made in a major artery, which has given it the name &quot;&quot;pin-hole&quot; surgery&quot; (as opposed to &quot;&quot;key-hole&quot; surgery&quot;).

==Procedures==
; Angioplasty: is an intervention to dilate either arteries or veins.
; Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI/Coronary angioplasty):the use of angioplasty for the treatment of obstruction of coronary arteries as a result of coronary artery disease. A deflated balloon catheter is advanced into the obstructed artery and inflated to relieve the narrowing; certain devices such as coronary stents can be deployed to keep the blood vessel open. Various other procedures can also be performed at the same time. After a heart attack, it can be restricted to the culprit vessel (the one whose obstruction or thrombosis is suspected of causing the event) or complete revascularization; complete revascularization is more efficacious in terms of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality.

:PCI is also used in people after other forms of myocardial infarction or unstable angina where there is a high risk of further events. The use of PCI in addition to anti-angina medication in stable angina  may reduce the number of patients with angina attacks for up to 3 years following the therapy, but it does not reduce the risk of death, future myocardial infarction, or need for other interventions.
; Valvuloplasty: It is the dilation of narrowed cardiac valves (usually mitral, aortic, or pulmonary).
; Congenital heart defect correction: Percutaneous approaches can be employed to correct atrial septal and ventricular septal defects, closure of a patent ductus arteriosus, and angioplasty of the great vessels.
; Percutaneous valve replacement: An alternative to open heart surgery, percutaneous valve replacement is the replacement of a heart valve using percutaneous methods. This is performed on the aortic valve (percutaneous aortic valve replacement/TAVI procedure), pulmonary valve and recently the mitral valve 
; Percutaneous valve repair: An alternative to open heart surgery, percutaneous valve repair is performed on the mitral valve using the MONARC system or MitraClip system 
; Coronary thrombectomy: Coronary thrombectomy involves the removal of a thrombus (blood clot) from the coronary arteries.

Open heart surgery of the heart is performed by a cardiothoracic surgeon. Some interventional cardiology procedures are performed in conjunction with a cardiothoracic surgeon.

==Education==

In the US and Canada, interventional cardiology requires a minimum of seven years of post-graduate medical education and up to 9 years of post-graduate medical education for those wanting to perform advanced structural heart procedures.

*Undergraduate degree (4 years)
*Medical degree (4 years)
*Internal Medicine residency (3 years)
*Cardiology fellowship (3 years)
*Interventional Cardiology fellowship (1–2 years)
*Structural Heart Intervention fellowship (1 year)

<doc id="696237" wikidata="Q1131533" url="?curid=696237" title="Dark Moor">
<text>Dark Moor is a Spanish symphonic power metal band from Madrid. Formed in 1993, they produced three full-length albums before undergoing a line-up change in which three members left the band to form their own project, Dreamaker. Afterwards, the band continued under the same name, recruiting suitable replacements in time for their eponymous 2003 album. Since 2002, guitarist Enrik Garcia has been the band&#x27;s sole remaining founding member.

==Background==
Dark Moor was formed in 1993 in Madrid, Spain, and recorded their debut album, &quot;Shadowland&quot;, in the summer of 1999. Dark Moor played live supporting Demons and Wizards on their Spanish tour.

Dark Moor began the recording sessions for their second album, &quot;The Hall of the Olden Dreams&quot;, in August 2000 at New Sin Studios with producer Luigi Stefanini. During these recording sessions, the band recorded their cover of &quot;Halloween&quot;, which was included on the CD &quot;The Keepers of Jericho part I - A Tribute to Helloween&quot; (Arise Records).

Their EP &quot;The Fall of Melnibone&quot; was released in June 2001. This EP was a limited edition; 1500 copies were released and only for the Spanish market.

Dark Moor began the recording of their third album, &quot;The Gates of Oblivion&quot;, in Autumn 2001 at New Sin Studios. Dark Moor signed with the major label JVC for the Asian release. The band played 18 gigs at festivals such as Rock Machina, Viña Rock and Nit De Reis. After the first part of the tour, keyboardist Roberto Peña left the band and they were forced to finish the tour with a guest musician.

In August 2003 Dark Moor recorded four new exclusive acoustic tracks along with a string quartet, to be included in &quot;Between Light and Darkness&quot;, which was released in April 2003. Due to differing points of view regarding the musical direction for the next Dark Moor album, vocalist Elisa Martin, guitarist Albert Maroto and drummer Jorge Sáez decided to leave Dark Moor to start a new band.

The two remaining members of the band decided to start a search for new members. After the auditions, they accepted vocalist Alfred Romero, guitarist Jose Garrido, and drummer Andy C.

In August 2003, the band started recording their fourth album, &quot;Dark Moor&quot;, at New Sin Studios in Italy. Following a month of recording sessions, the album was mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios.

On 23 November 2006, the band announced the departure of their drummer on their official website, due to &quot;incompatibility with his other musical projects.&quot; He would go on to play drums for Saratoga. His replacement, Roberto Cappa, was previously in the Spanish metal band Anima Sola.

In January 2009, their seventh album &quot;Autumnal&quot; was released.

The band made an announcement on their website, dated 4 June 2010, that their eighth album was in the works. It featured Berenice Musa as a guest vocalist. The album is titled &quot;Ancestral Romance&quot; and it was released in November 2010.

On 18 June 2013 the band released their ninth album &quot;Ars Musica&quot;, with the Japanese limited version including a bonus CD with five bonus tracks. They toured Mexico and Asia the same year, as well as few dates in Europe in 2014 to support the new album.

Dark Moor started recording their 10th studio album, &quot;Project X&quot;, on 27 July 2015 and released it in Europe on 6 November 2015 on Scarlet Records.

On 21 July 2018, Enrik Garcia, guitarist and founder of the band, announced via Facebook that their next album would be called &quot;Origins&quot; and that, after the parenthesis they did with ufology themes on &quot;Project X&quot;, they would return to their habitual themes; &quot;Origins&quot; will be about the Celtic world, also adding Celtic instruments on their new songs. This album was released on 12 December 2018.

<text>The Cooper&#x27;s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake is an annual event held on the Spring Bank Holiday at Cooper&#x27;s Hill, at Brockworth near Gloucester, England. Participants race down the long hill chasing a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese. It is uncertain when the tradition first began, and is possibly much older than its earliest known written attestation in 1826. The event has a long tradition, held by the people of the village, but now people from a wide range of countries take part in the competition as well. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it a &quot;world-famous event,&quot; with winners coming from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States.

==Format==
From the top of the hill, a round of Double Gloucester cheese is sent rolling down the hill, which is long, and with a slope of around 50 percent (26.6 degrees). Competitors then start racing down the hill after the cheese. The first person over the finish line at the bottom of the hill wins the cheese. The competitors aim to catch the cheese; however, it has around a one-second head start and can reach high speeds, enough to knock over and injure a spectator. Multiple races are held during the day, with separate events for men and women.

In the 2013 competition, a foam replica replaced the cheese for safety reasons, but a real cheese was restored the following year.

==History==

This ceremony originally took place each Whit Monday, but was later moved to the Spring Bank Holiday. The first written evidence of cheese rolling is found in a message written to the Gloucester town crier in 1826; even then it was apparent that the event was an old tradition, and it is believed to be at least six hundred years old.

Two possible origins have been proposed for the ceremony. First, it may have evolved from a requirement for maintaining grazing rights on the common. Second, there may be pagan origins for the custom of rolling objects down the hill. It is thought that bundles of burning brushwood were rolled down the hill to represent the birth of the New Year after winter. Connected with this belief is the traditional scattering of buns, biscuits and sweets at the top of the hill by the Master of Ceremonies. This is said to be a fertility rite to encourage the fruits of harvest.

In 1982, a team of students from the University of Bristol filmed the 31 May event using film cameras, with one camera overcranked to produce slow motion.

In 1993, sixteen people were injured, four of them seriously, chasing cheeses down the hill with its one-in-three gradient (18.4 degrees).

In 2009, safety concerns were raised after 15,000 spectators arrived, when there was only space for around 5000. These concerns led to the organisers cancelling the 2010 event. Despite the cancellation, around 100 people attended and held an unofficial event. 

In 2011, a new 2-day ticketed event was proposed in order to address the safety concerns raised in previous years and to allow the event to continue operating. The proposals were received negatively due to the cost of tickets, and the proposed event was cancelled following the organisers receiving abuse. Despite the cancellation, the event continued unofficially with around 200 people attending.

The event has continued, however without official management or planning alongside the Council Safety Advisory Group. 

In 2020 and 2021, the cheese-rolling event was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cheese-rolling event returned on Sunday 5 June 2022. ending a two-year absence.

==Cheese==

The cheese currently used in the event is Double Gloucester, a hard cheese traditionally made in a circular shape. Each is protected for the rolling by a wooden casing round the side, and is decorated with ribbons at the start of the race. Formerly, three cheeses were presented by parishioners, and the cheeses were usually rolled by them. A collection is usually made now to purchase them, as well as sweets, and also to provide prize money.

Since 1988, the cheese has been supplied by local cheesemaker Diana Smart and her son Rod from their Churcham farm. In May 2013, a police inspector warned the 86-year-old Smart that she could be held responsible for injuries. Chief Superintendent Nigel Avron of Gloucestershire Constabulary also made these comments: &quot;If you are an organiser in some way or some capacity you could potentially be held liable for something that took place at that event&quot;. Diana Smart died in 2021. In recent years, organisers of the event have felt compelled to use a lightweight foam version for safety reasons. In the second race of 2013, Australian Caleb Stalder managed to catch the fake cheese and claim victory despite being some way behind the leaders.

==Injuries==
Due to the steepness and uneven surface of Cooper&#x27;s Hill, there are usually several injuries each year. St John Ambulance have previously provided first aid cover at the event; however, this stopped in 2012 when the event was no longer being officially managed.

Canadian competitor Delaney Irving won the ladies race in 2023, despite finishing unconscious, and only learning of her victory in the medical enclosure. A total of six competitors were transported to hospital by ambulance treatment following the event.

Cooper&#x27;s Hill Cheese Rolling has been summarised by a previous participant as &quot;twenty young men chasing a cheese off a cliff and tumbling 200 yards to the bottom, where they are scraped up by paramedics and packed off to hospital&quot;.

There is no official medical provision on site, leading to concerns from the local resilience forum about the safety of the event.

<doc id="696250" wikidata="Q848376" url="?curid=696250" title="Kiddush">
<text>Kiddush (; ), , is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Additionally, the word refers to a small repast held on Shabbat or festival mornings after the prayer services and before the meal.

==Significance==
The Torah refers to two requirements concerning Shabbat – to &quot;keep it&quot; and to &quot;remember it&quot; (&quot;shamor&quot; and &quot;zakhor&quot;). Jewish law therefore requires that Shabbat be observed in two respects. One must &quot;keep it&quot; by refraining from thirty-nine forbidden activities, and one must &quot;remember it&quot; by making special arrangements for the day, and specifically through the &quot;kiddush&quot; ceremony.

Reciting &quot;kiddush&quot; before the meal on the eve of Shabbat and Jewish holidays is thus a commandment from the Torah (as it is explained by the Oral Torah), although one can also fulfill the Biblical commandment by reciting Maariv of the Sabbath which also mentions the holiness of the day. Reciting &quot;kiddush&quot; before the morning meal on Shabbat and holidays is a requirement of rabbinic origin. Kiddush is not usually recited at the third meal on Shabbat, although Maimonides was of the opinion that wine should be drunk at this meal as well.

==Rituals==

To honor the mitzvah of reciting &quot;kiddush&quot;, a silver goblet is often used, although any cup can suffice. The cup must hold a &quot;revi&#x27;it&quot; of liquid. A &quot;revi&#x27;it&quot; is between (Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz) and (Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh). After the person reciting the kiddush drinks from the wine, the rest of it is passed around the table or poured out into small cups for the other participants. Alternatively, wine is poured for each of the participants before kiddush.

Before reciting &quot;kiddush&quot;, the challah, which will be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes precedence to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with &quot;kiddush&quot;, the challah is covered to &quot;remove&quot; it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during &quot;kiddush&quot;).

Wine or grape juice may be used for kiddush. The Talmud permits the use of unfermented fresh grape juice for sacramental use. While later legal codes have expressed a preference for wine, traditional and orthodox communities generally permit the use of grape juice in place of wine for blessings and rituals.

On Friday night &quot;kiddush&quot; may be recited over the challah; the blessing over bread is substituted for the blessing over wine. In that case, the ritual hand-washing normally performed prior to consuming the challah is done &quot;before&quot; the recitation of &quot;kiddush&quot;. Some Ashkenazic communities, especially German Jews and Hungarian Jews follow this procedure even if wine is present. If there is only sufficient wine or grape juice for one kiddush, it should be used for the Friday night kiddush.

In many synagogues, &quot;kiddush&quot; is recited on Friday night at the end of services. This &quot;kiddush&quot; does not take the place of the obligation to recite &quot;kiddush&quot; at the Friday night meal. When recited in a synagogue, the first paragraph (Genesis 2:1–3) is omitted.

The text of the Friday night &quot;kiddush&quot; begins with a passage from Genesis 2:1–3, as a testimony to God&#x27;s creation of the world and cessation of work on the seventh day. Some people stand during the recital of these Biblical verses (even if they sit for kiddush), since according to Jewish law testimony must be given standing.

There are different customs regarding sitting or standing while reciting kiddush depending on communal and family tradition.

Some Hasidic and Sephardic Jews pour small amounts of water into the wine before kiddush on Friday night. This is done either to commemorate the old custom of &quot;mixing of the wine&quot; in the days when wine was too strong to be drunk without dilution, or to infuse the water (wine?) with the quality of mercy which is symbolized by water (wine?).

Since the Shabbat morning &quot;kiddush&quot; is rabbinically rather than biblically mandated, it has a lesser status than the Friday night &quot;kiddush&quot;. Its name &quot;Kiddusha Rabba&quot; (קידושא רבא, &quot;The Great &quot;Kiddush&quot;&quot;), first mentioned in the Talmud, is euphemistic. There are different versions for the kiddush on Sabbath morning, and it is generally shorter than the Friday night kiddush. Originally, this kiddush consisted only of the blessing over the wine. Later, additional verses related to Shabbat were added. However, there are a wide variety of customs as to which verse are recited, and in some communities no verses at all are recited. Some communities have a similarly brief Kiddush for the third Sabbath meal as well, made in the middle of the meal.

==Text==


===Other variations===
On Rosh Hashanah, the night Kiddush is similar to that of the other festivals. Where it differs, it is usually to follow the pattern of middle blessing of the Amidah. (An example is the concluding formula &quot;Blessed are You, the LORD, King over the entire world, Who sanctifies [the Sabbath,] Israel, and the Day of Remembrance.&quot;) During the day, the verses Psalms 81:4–5 (Ashkenazi) or Numbers 10:10 (Sephardic) are recited prior to the blessing over wine. Many also say the festival verses (usually first), and on Shabbat all recite the relevant verses (see above) at the very beginning.

On Yom Kippur, being a fast day, no kiddush is recited, even by one who will be eating for medical reasons, and even on Shabbat.

On the first two nights of Sukkot, the blessing leishev ba-sukkah is recited at the end of Kiddush, after she-hechiyanu. On the second night in the Diaspora, some switch the order and recite leishev before she-hechiyanu. During the daytime kiddush, leishev is recited after the blessing on wine, before drinking. On the Sabbath of Chol Hamoed of Sukkot, leishev is recited at the end of kiddush.

===Yaknehaz===
When a festival is on Saturday night, Kiddush is recited, but Havdalah must also be said because Shabbat is holier than the festivals. The sequence of blessings in such a case is known as &quot;yak&#x27;n&#x27;haz&quot; (יקנה&quot;ז), for &quot;yayin, kiddush, ner, havdalah, zman&quot;, meaning &quot;wine, kiddush, flame, havdalah, shehecheyanu&quot;. That is, first the blessing over wine, then the standard kiddush blessing (see above), then the blessing for the flame (&quot;borei m&#x27;orei ha&#x27;eish&quot;, Who creates the radiance of the fire), then a modified havdalah blessing (ending with &quot;Who differentiates between (one level of) holiness and (another level of) holiness&quot;), and then the shehecheyanu blessing (omitted on the final days of Passover; see above). Essentially, the havdalah blessings are recited after kiddush, but before shehechiyanu, which is usually the last blessing to ever be recited. Spices are not used.

In the opposite case, when Shabbat &quot;follows&quot; a festival, the regular Shabbat kiddush is recited, with no variations.

====Yaknehaz Candle====
While on a year-round Motzai Shabbat one can extinguish the candle used for Havdalah, this is not permitted when the evening coincides with a Holiday date (Yom Tov). Rather than simply picking up two of the candles already lit for Yom Tov when the blessing for fire is recited as part of a modified Havdalah, and holding them so that their wicks are interlaced, it is easier to use a special two-wick candle as one of the Holiday candles; they are sized to fit in a regular Shabbat candelabra or candlestick holder (in place of a standard one-wick candle).

This special candle is called a &quot;Yaknehaz Candle&quot;.

==Synagogue kiddush==
In many Ashkenazic communities, Kiddush is recited at the end of Friday night services even though nobody eats there. This was instituted in ancient times on behalf of guests who slept in the synagogue and did not have a place to eat, and Halachic authorities debate whether it is proper to continue this practice.

The term &quot;kiddush&quot; also refers to refreshments served either at home or at the synagogue following prayer services on Shabbat or Yom Tov, which begin with the recitation of kiddush. Cake, crackers, and gefilte fish are traditionally served. On Shavuot morning, the custom is to serve dairy foods such as cheesecake and cheese blintzes for the kiddush.

According to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, kiddush should be recited preceding the Shabbat meal. Eating &quot;mezonot&quot; such as cake or cookies or drinking an additional revi&#x27;it of wine is also sufficient according to the opinion of most Rishonim. Nevertheless, some Jews recite kiddush only when about to partake of a full meal.

Often a &quot;kiddush&quot; is hosted by a family celebrating the birth of a daughter, a bar mitzvah, a wedding, an engagement, a birthday, or other happy occasion. Some people also host a &quot;kiddush&quot; on the yahrtzeit of a parent or other relative. In some synagogues the celebrant is honored with reciting the Shabbat morning &quot;kiddush&quot; on behalf of all the attendees. In other synagogues the rabbi or gabbai recites the &quot;kiddush&quot;. Some Jews make kiddush on Shabbat morning over liquor instead of wine. When this is done, the blessing recited is &quot;she-hakol nihyeh bid&#x27;varo&quot; instead of &quot;borei p&#x27;ri ha-gafen&quot;. The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; (an authoritative Ashkenazi halakhic text) rules that under extenuating circumstances, liquor may be substituted for wine on the grounds that it is &quot;Hamar Medina,&quot; a drink one would serve to a respected guest; nevertheless, many rely on this even without extenuating circumstances.

== History of using white wine ==
During the 17th century, because of blood libels, David HaLevi Segal &quot;issued a Passover ruling ... that the traditional red wine used at the Seders be substituted with white wine in lands of persecution in order to not arouse suspicion.&quot;

<doc id="696255" wikidata="Q2548288" url="?curid=696255" title="MS Wanganella">
<text>MS &quot;Wanganella was an Australian-registered [[ocean liner]] built by [[Harland and Wolff]] that entered service on the [[trans-Tasman]] route in 1933. Originally named Achimota&quot;, she was acquired by Huddart Parker after the original sale to Elder Dempster Lines fell through.

Renamed &quot;Wanganella&quot;, the ship sailed between New Zealand and Australia until 1941, when she was converted into a hospital ship. As Australian Hospital Ship (AHS) &quot;Wanganella&quot;, the ship operated in support of Australian forces until 1946, when she was returned to her civilian operator. In the 1950s and 1960s &quot;Wanganella&quot; was affected by several incidents of industrial action by wharf labourers.

The increase in travel by air made operating the ship less viable, but before the ship was due to be scrapped in 1963, she was acquired and moored in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, and used as a hostel for construction workers building the Manapouri Power Station until 1970. In April 1970, a tug towed &quot;Wanganella&quot; to Hong Kong, then later Taiwan, where she was scrapped.

==Building==

Harland and Wolff built &quot;Wanganella&quot; as yard number 849 on slip number five in its Belfast yard, launched her on 17 December 1929 and completed her on 29 November 1932. Elder Dempster Lines had ordered her as &quot;Achimota&quot; for its West African trade. But Elder Dempster was in financial trouble at the time and never took the ship over. Eventually the Melbourne-based Australian shipping company Huddart Parker bought &quot;Achimota&quot; in September 1932 and renamed her &quot;Wanganella&quot;, beginning regular service on 12 January 1933.

&quot;Wanganella&quot; had twin screws, each driven by an eight-cylinder four-stroke single-acting diesel engine. Harland and Wolff built the engines under licence to a Burmeister &amp; Wain design. Between them the two engines were rated at 1,305 NHP and gave her a service speed of .

&quot;Wanganella&quot; was equipped with wireless direction finding. In 1934 her code letters LHVJ were superseded by the call sign VJPQ.

==Operational history==
===Before World War II===
Renamed &quot;Wanganella&quot;, the ship was a top-rated trans-Tasman ocean liner, with berths for 304 first class and 104 second class passengers. She primarily sailed between the cities of Auckland and Wellington in New Zealand, and Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, crossing the Tasman Sea in three and a half days.
On 28 December 1937 she collided with the trawler off the coast of New South Wales.
On 19 June 1940 she helped to rescue passengers from after the latter hit a mine and sank off the coast of Auckland.

====Message in a bottle====
On 11 September 1935, a message in a bottle was put in the ocean, reading:&quot;Thrown overboard by Mr &amp; Mrs Robert Hare and son Billy 11/9/35 en route Syd/Auck. Will finder please communicate with above at Ballarat, Vict – Aust, The City Beautiful, Largest inland city of the commonwealth.&quot;

This was discovered at Fraser Island, Queensland, some 20 years later, but the message was forgotten until 2018 when the finder sought to research the senders of the message, including the Captain of the ship (Captain R Darrock), and a named witness (W Elsden-Dew). The message had been written on a menu card for an evening meal. The menu, dated Tuesday, 10 September 1935 was one day old when it was adorned with a handwritten note, placed into the cork-topped bottle, and thrown into the ocean. Of note, Mr Robert Hare was Manager of the Huddart Parker Line of which &quot;Wanganella&quot; was a part, and his son William (Billy) became a leading radiologist and Professor of Radiology at the University of Melbourne.

===Hospital ship===
During World War II, &quot;Wanganella&quot; was converted to serve as an Australian Hospital Ship (AHS). Between 19 May 1941 and 1946, AHS &quot;Wanganella&quot; carried wounded and sick evacuees from the Middle East, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Borneo and the South Pacific, travelling over and transporting 13,385 wounded.
A recently-liberated soldier from Batu Lintang camp, Kuching, Sarawak wrote of her:
===Post-war===
On her maiden voyage after the war, &quot;Wanganella&quot; had a narrow escape when she ran aground on Barrett Reef (later to claim with 53 lives lost) at the entrance to Wellington Harbour in New Zealand. On 19 January 1947, while making her first trans-Tasman voyage after the war, &quot;Wanganella&quot; struck Barrett Reef just before midnight and stuck fast. The weather conditions were unusually benign, and remained so for the 18 days she spent on the reef. Such benign weather is still known in Wellington as &quot;Wanganella weather&quot;. No-one was injured, and the passengers were taken off the ship the morning after the accident. The damage she incurred put her out of action for 22 months, mainly as a result of industrial action while she was laid up in a floating dock for repairs. Harland and Wolff sent out the necessary steelwork from Belfast.
&quot;Wanganella&quot; was caught up again in industrial action; this time in the 1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute. This 151-day-long industrial battle between the employers and the watersiders in New Zealand began when watersiders refused to work overtime. The New Zealand Government, hand-in-glove with the employers, was determined to smash the union and introduced Emergency Regulations. The army was brought in to work the wharves. &quot;Wanganella&quot; became involved in smuggling money and manpower between Australia and New Zealand, with her Australian crew carrying thousands of pounds to New Zealand from various unions in Australia, in support of their New Zealand comrades.

In about 1960, &quot;Wanganella&quot; was acquired by the scrap metal dealer Albert G Sims, and was sent to Singapore for breaking up as scrap. However, there was a drop in scrap metal prices, and the ship returned to service on the Sydney to Auckland run. In early 1962, when the owners were taken over by McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd of Melbourne, the ship was sold to the Hang Fung Shipping &amp; Trading Co Ltd of Hong Kong, operating under the same name.

===Hostel ship===

During the 1950s and 1960s, the expansion of civilian air travel made trans-Tasman shipping obsolete. In 1963, shortly before the ship was due to be scrapped, engineers working on the construction of the Manapouri Power Station in New Zealand acquired &quot;Wanganella&quot;.

Between 1963 and 1970, &quot;Wanganella&quot; was moored in Doubtful Sound to be used as a hostel for workers building the tailrace tunnel, and the Wilmot Pass access road. The vessel became notorious for the drinking culture on board. A popular legend is when the vessel was to be towed away, tugs apparently struggled to dislodge the ship from a bed of empty beer cans that had been tossed overboard.

&quot;Wanganella&quot; was sold for scrap in 1970, and was towed to Hong Kong, then Taiwan. The cove in which &quot;Wanganella&quot; was moored and the stream that supplied the water to the liner are now gazetted as Wanganella Cove and Wanganella Stream.

<text>A patronal feast or patronal festival (; ; ; ; ) is a yearly celebration dedicated – in countries influenced by Christianity – to the &#x27;heavenly advocate&#x27; or &#x27;patron&#x27; of the location holding the festival, who is a saint or virgin. The day of this celebration is called patronal [[feast day]], patronal day or patron day of said location.

Patronal festivals may reflect national holidays (e.g. the feast of Saint George, patron saint of England, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, Portugal, and various regions of Spain), but they usually reflect the celebration of a single city or town.
In larger cities, there may even be several festivals, usually about the patron saint of the local parish.

== Celebration ==
Depending on the budget and tradition, patronal festivals may typically run from one day to one week, though some festivals may exceed that length.
The festivities usually include religious processions honoring its Catholic heritage. However, elements of local culture have been incorporated as well.

Usually, town members adorn the town streets with colorful decorations and other things.

Most patronal festivals feature traditional fairs known as verbenas (, plural: &quot;sagre&quot;), possibly including elements typical of the travelling carnivals.
They feature parades, artisans, street vendors, regional food stands, amusement rides, games, and live entertainment, among other things.
There are usually alcoholic beverages – wine and beer – and music and dancing, either organized or spontaneously; in Southern Italy and Argentina, for example, folk dances known as tarantellas are very common.

=== In Europe ===
==== Austria and Germany ====
==== France ====
==== Italy ====
The Italian national patronal day, on 4 October, celebrates Saints Francis and Catherine. Each city or town also celebrates a public holiday on the occasion of the festival of the local patron saint, for example: Rome on 29 June (Saints Peter and Paul), Milan on 7 December (Saint Ambrose), Naples on 19 September (Saint Januarius), Venice on 25 April (Saint Mark the Evangelist) and Florence on 24 June (Saint John the Baptist). Notable traditional patronal festivals in Italy are the Feast of Saints Francis and Catherine, the Festival of Saint Agatha, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the Feast of San Gennaro and the Feast of Our Lady of the Hens.

;Examples
* Feast of Our Lady of the Hens on the Second Sunday of Easter in Pagani, Campania
* Feast of Saints Francis and Catherine
* Feast of San Gennaro

==== Spain ====
;Examples
* Fiestas del Pilar around 12 October in Zaragoza
* La Mercè around 24 September in Barcelona
* Fallas, with main events from 15 until 19 March (Saint Joseph&#x27;s day), but including pyrotechnic spectacles every day from 1 to 19 March
* Bonfires of Saint John around 24 June in Alicante
* Festival of San Fermín around 7 July in Pamplona, actually spanning from 6 July to 14 July
* San Isidro Labrador around 15 May in rural areas mostly in Extremadura and Andalusia, but also in Madrid.

==== Wales ====
=== In Latin America ===
==== Puerto Rico ====
Most Latin American countries dedicate the first day to the saint or virgin being celebrated, the others to entertainment, but in the US territory of Puerto Rico the musical and entertainment festivities begin right away.

== Further examples ==

* Feast of Saint Francis of Assisi on 4 October, in Yucuaquín (El Salvador), in Somerville, Massachusetts (US) and in Italy
* Festa de São João do Porto around 23 June in Porto (Portugal)

=== Serbia ===

In Serbian culture, instead of local patron saints, people celebrate family&#x27;s patron saints. These celebrations are known as &#x27;slava&#x27; in Serbia.

<text>Dreamaker was a Spanish power metal band, formed by three former Dark Moor members, following the band&#x27;s split.

==Biography==
Dreamaker begun when vocalist Elisa Martin, guitarist Albert Maroto and drummer Jorge Sáez left Dark Moor, in 2003, due to musical differences. They were soon joined by second guitarist Matias Sosa and bassist Carlos Peña and Dark Moor&#x27;s former keyboard player, Roberto Camús, who had left the band in 2002, offered to play with Dreamaker, but left the band in a short time and was replaced by Nino Ruiz.

The band received a recording deal from Arise Records for two albums in September of that year, and proceeded to record their first album - &quot;Human Device&quot;. It was released throughout Europe, Japan and in a few Spanish-speaking countries in early 2004.

A Japanese tour followed in May and, while in the country, guitarists Albert Maroto and Matias Sosa recorded a video for Young Guitar Magazine.

Dreamaker then recorded the album &quot;Enclosed&quot;, in March 2005, introducing more electronic and mainstream elements into their sound.

<text>Learning Media Limited (Māori: &quot;Te Pou Taki Kōrero&quot;) was a New Zealand state-owned enterprise. The company published most of the Ministry of Education&#x27;s material. A division of the Ministry until 1993, it continued to publish the &quot;New Zealand School Journal&quot; and &quot;Junior Journal&quot; magazines and the &quot;Ready to Read&quot; readers for the Ministry, as well as provide services for other organisations.

It was formed from three former divisions of the abolished Department of Education in 1989, most notably the School Publications Branch, which had hitherto published the &quot;School Journal&quot;.

<doc id="696280" wikidata="Q5152592" url="?curid=696280" title="Commercialization">
<text>Commercialisation or commercializationis the process of introducing a new product or production method into commerce—making it available on the market. The term often connotes especially entry into the mass market (as opposed to entry into earlier niche markets), but it also includes a move from the laboratory into (even limited) commerce. Many technologies begin in a research and development laboratory or in an inventor&#x27;s workshop and may not be practical for commercial use in their infancy (as prototypes). The &quot;development&quot; segment of the &quot;research and development&quot; spectrum requires time and money as systems are engineered with a view to making the product or method a paying commercial proposition. 

The product launch of a new product is the final stage of new product development – at this point advertising, sales promotion, and other marketing efforts encourage commercial adoption of the product or method. Beyond commercialization (in which technologies enter the business world) can lie consumerization (in which they become consumer goods, as for example when computers went from the laboratory to the enterprise and then to the home, pocket, or body).

== Process==
Commercialization is often confused with sales, marketing, or business development. The commercialization process has three key aspects:
# The funnel. It is essential to look at many ideas to get one or two products or businesses that can be sustained long-term.
# Commercialization is a stage-wise process, and each stage has its own key goals and milestones.
# It is vital to involve key stakeholders early, including customers.

== Issues ==
Proposed commercialization of a product can raise the following questions:

# When to launch: Factors such as potential cannibalization of the sales of a vendor&#x27;s other products, any requirement for further improvement of the proposed new product, or unfavorable market conditions may operate to delay a product launch.
# Where to launch: A potential vendor can start marketing in a single location, in one or several regions, or in a national or international market. Existing resources (in terms of capital, and operational capacities) and the degree of managerial confidence may strongly influence the proposed launch-mode. Smaller vendors usually launch in attractive cities or regions, while larger companies may enter a national market at once.Global roll-outs generally remain the preserve of multinational conglomerates, since they have the necessary size and make use of international distribution systems (e.g., Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble). Other multinationals may use a &quot;lead-country&quot; strategy: introducing the new product in one country/region at a time (e.g. Colgate-Palmolive).
# Whom to target: Research- and test-marketing may identify a primary consumer group. The ideal primary consumer group should consist of innovators, early adopters, heavy users and/or opinion leaders. This will encourage adoption by other buyers in the market during the product-growth period.
# How to launch: Prospective vendors should decide on an action plan for introducing a proposed product - a plan shaped by addressing the questions above. The vendor has to develop a viable marketing-mix and to structure a corresponding marketing-budget.

<doc id="696291" wikidata="Q1032099" url="?curid=696291" title="English ship Sovereign of the Seas">
<text>Sovereign of the Seas was a 17th-century warship of the English Navy. She was ordered as a 90-gun first-rate ship of the line, but at launch was armed with 102 bronze guns at the insistence of the king. She was later renamed Sovereign under the republican Commonwealth, and then HMS Royal Sovereign at the Restoration of Charles II.

The elaborately gilded stern ordered by Charles I of England meant enemy ships knew her as the &quot;Golden Devil&quot;. She was launched on 13 October 1637, and served from 1638 until 1697, when a fire burnt the ship to the waterline at Chatham.

== History ==

The planning of a new First Rate was asked for in June 1634 on the personal initiative of Charles I of England, as a prestige project. The decision provoked much opposition from the Brethren of Trinity House, who pointed out that &quot;There is no port in the Kingdome that can harbour this ship. The wild sea must be her port, her anchors and cables her safety; if either fail, the ship must perish, the King lose his jewel, four or five hundred man must die, and perhaps some great and noble peer&quot;.

These objections were overcome with the help of Admiral Sir John Pennington, and the ship was ordered in May 1635, with the keel being laid down on 21 December. Construction was supervised by Peter Pett, later a Commissioner of the Navy, guided by his father Phineas, the royal shipwright, and the ship was launched at Woolwich Dockyard on 13 October 1637. As the second three-decked first-rate (the first three-decker being the &quot;Prince Royal&quot; of 1610), she was the predecessor of Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Victory&quot;, although the &quot;Revenge&quot;, built in 1577 by Mathew Baker, was the inspiration for her, providing the innovation of a single deck devoted entirely to broadside guns.

The most extravagantly decorated warship in the Royal Navy, she was adorned from stern to bow with gilded carvings against a black background, designed by Anthony van Dyck, and made by John Christmas and Mathias Christmas. Construction costs of £65,586 was funded by Ship Money, the gilding alone being £6,691, the price of an average warship. For comparison, the total tax generated in 1637 was £208,000.

Charles ordered 102 bronze cannon, to ensure it was the most powerfully armed ship in the world; these were made by John Browne. &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; had 118 gun ports and only 102 guns. The shape of the bow meant that the foremost gun ports on the lower gun deck were blocked by the anchor cable. Consequently, the fore chase – the guns facing forward – occupied the next ports. There were two demi-cannon drakes – one port, one starboard – some long, weighing together five tons (5000 kg). They had a bore of and fired a shot weighing , using around ten pounds of gunpowder.

In the third ports from the bow, there were two demi-cannon drakes weighing, together, 4.3 tons (4300 kg). Behind them were twenty cannon drakes, nine feet long, and weighing in all 45.7 tons (45700 kg). In the third port from the stern were two more demi-cannon drakes weighing, together, 4.3 tons (4300 kg). The last two ports on either side were occupied by the stern chase – four demi-cannon drakes weighing a total of 11.4 tons (11400 kg).

The middle gun deck had heavy fortified culverins – that is, guns short for their bore – fore and aft. There were two pieces, weighing 4.8 tons (4800 kg), in the fore chase; four pieces, weighing 10.2 tons (10200 kg), in the stern chase. Immediately behind the fore chase were two demi-culverin drakes, long, weighing some 1.9 tons (1900 kg). Then came twenty-two culverin drakes weighing a total of 30.4 tons (30400 kg).

On the upper gun deck there were two fortified demi-culverins in the fore chase and two in the stern chase, both pairs weighing 2.8 tons (2800 kg). Between them there were twenty-two demi-culverin drakes, long, weighing over 21 tons (21000 kg) in total.

There were eight demi-culverin drakes weighing 7.7 tons (7700 kg) in the forecastle; another six weighing 5.7 tons (5700 kg) on the half-deck. The quarterdeck carried two six-foot demi-culverin drake cutts – a cutt, again, being a shorter version of a gun – weighing 16 hundredweight (726 kg). Then there were another two six-foot culverin cutts, weighing 1.3 tons (1,179 kg), aft of the forecastle bulkhead. In all, &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; carried 155.9 tons (141,430 kg) of guns – and that did not include the weight of the gun carriages. Altogether they cost £26,441 13s 6d including £3 per piece to have the Tudor rose, a crown and the motto: &quot;Carolvs Edgari sceptrvm aqvarum&quot; – &quot;Charles has established Edgar’s sceptre of the waters&quot; – engraved on them. The gun carriages, made by Matthew Banks, Master Carpenter for the Office of Ordinance, cost another £558 11s 8d.

By 1642, her armament had been reduced to 90 guns. Until 1655, she was also exceptionally large for an English vessel; no other ships of Charles were larger than &quot;Prince Royal&quot;.

&quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; was not so much built because of tactical considerations, but as a deliberate attempt to bolster the reputation of the English crown. Her name was, in itself, a political statement as Charles tried to revive the perceived ancient right of the English kings to be recognised as the &#x27;lords of the seas.&#x27; English ships demanded that other ships strike their flags in salute, even in foreign ports. The Dutch legal thinker Hugo Grotius had argued for a &quot;mare liberum&quot;, a sea free to be used by all. Such a concept was mainly favourable to Dutch trade; in reaction, John Selden and William Monson published the book &quot;Mare Clausum&quot; (&quot;the Closed Sea&quot;) in 1635, with special permission of Charles, which attempted to prove that King Edgar had already been recognised as &quot;Rex Marium&quot;, or &quot;sovereign of the seas&quot; – this book had been previously repressed by James I. The name of the ship explicitly referred to this dispute; King Edgar was the central theme of the transom carvings.

Rear-Admiral Sir William Symonds noted that after the ship&#x27;s launch she was &quot;cut down&quot; and made a safe and fast ship. In the time of the Commonwealth of England all ships named after royalty were renamed; it was first decided to change the name of the ship into &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, but in 1650 it became a simple &quot;Sovereign&quot;. In 1651 she was again made more manoeuvrable by reducing upperworks after which she was described as &quot;a delicate frigate (I think the whole world hath not her like)&quot;. She served throughout the wars of the Commonwealth and became the flagship of General at Sea Robert Blake. She was involved in all of the great English naval conflicts fought against the United Provinces and France and was referred to as &#x27;The Golden Devil&#x27; (&quot;den Gulden Duvel&quot;) by the Dutch.

When, during the First Anglo-Dutch War, on 21 October 1652 the States General of the Netherlands in a secret session determined the reward money for the crews of fireships that succeeded in destroying an enemy vessel, &quot;Sovereign&quot; was singled out: an extra prize of 3000 guilders was promised &#x27;in case they should ruin the ship named the Sovereign&#x27;. The ship had not seen action during the Civil War, remaining laid up. After being refitted in 1651, she had her first fight in the Battle of the Kentish Knock, armed with 106 guns. In this battle she ran aground on the Kentish Knock itself. and remained in service for nearly sixty years as the best ship in the English fleet. By 1660 her armament had been changed to 100 guns. She was rebuilt at Chatham Dockyard from 1659 to 1660 as a first-rate ship of the line of 100 guns in wartime (92 in peacetime) with flatter gundecks and renamed &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; prior to her re-launch; most of the carvings had been removed.

She was present at the Four Days&#x27; Battle of 1 to 4 June 1666, and the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle of 25 July 1666, each fighting the Dutch fleet in the North Sea.

She was smaller than &quot;Naseby&quot; (later renamed &quot;Royal Charles&quot;), but she was in regular service during the three Anglo-Dutch Wars, surviving the Raid on the Medway in 1667 by being at Portsmouth at the time. She underwent a second rebuild from 1680 to 1685 at Chatham Dockyard, relaunching as a first rate of 100 guns, before taking part in the outset of the War of the Grand Alliance. For the first time she ventured into the Irish Sea, and later participated in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690) and the Battle of La Hougue (1692), when she was more than fifty years old. In that period she was the first ship in history that flew royals above her topgallant sails and a topgallant sail on the jigger-mast.

==Destruction==
&quot;Sovereign&quot; became leaky and defective with age during the reign of William III, and was laid up at Chatham Dockyards for repairs late in 1695.

She ignominiously ended her days, in mid January 1696, by being burnt to the water line as a result of having been set on fire by accident (it was 1697 in continental Europe, due to more modern calendar there). A bosun, who was on night watch, left a candle burning unattended. Admitting to his fault he was court-martialled on 27 January 1696 and not only publicly flogged but also imprisoned at Marshalsea for the rest of his life.

In her honour, naval tradition has kept the name of this ship afloat, and several subsequent ships have been named HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A painting from this ship survives on the ceiling of Commissioners House at Chatham Dockyard, over the grand staircase. It depicts an assembly of the gods and depicts Mars being crowned by Neptune, surrounded by the goddesses Hope, Peace, Justice and Plenty. The painting is surrounded by a gilded frieze depicting sea creatures. It is attributed to James Thornhill, the King&#x27;s Serjeant Painter. He painted the ceilings of the Royal Hospital Greenwich and the Dome of Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Thomas Carew&#x27;s poem &quot;Upon the Royal Ship called the &#x27;Sovereign of the Seas&#x27;, built by Peter Pett, Master Builder; His Father, Captain Phineas Pett, Supervisor: 1637&quot; is a paean to the vessel, calling it the eighth wonder of the world:
