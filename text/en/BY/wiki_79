<text>Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, designated as unsigned State Road 91 (SR 91), is a controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of Florida, maintained by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE). Spanning approximately along a northwest–southeast axis, the turnpike is in two sections. The SR 91 mainline runs roughly , from its southern terminus at an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) in Miami Gardens to an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood at its northern terminus. The Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike (abbreviated HEFT and designated as unsigned SR 821) continues from the southern end of the mainline for another to US Highway 1 (US 1) in Florida City. The slogan for the road is &quot;The Less Stressway&quot;. The mainline opened in stages between 1957 and 1964, while the extension was completed in 1974. The turnpike runs through Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, where it parallels I-95, and through Orlando, where it crosses I-4.

==Route description==
===Miami to Ft. Pierce===
The main section of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike begins at the northern end of the Golden Glades Interchange in Miami Gardens as a six-lane highway, and passes through the Golden Glades Toll Barrier, a cashless toll point, similar to the ones on the HEFT. About north of the toll gantry, it passes by Hard Rock Stadium, home to the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, to the west before intersecting with the northern end of the HEFT at the Miami-Dade/Broward County line from Golden Glades, continuing the HEFT&#x27;s mile marker. The highway goes through the inland suburbs of Miramar, Hollywood, and Davie, with an exit at Hollywood Boulevard (SR 820) at mile 50, and passing west of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood just south the Griffin Road (SR 818) interchange (exit 53). In Davie, about north of the Homestead Extension interchange, it intersects with I-595, providing direct access to Alligator Alley and Ft. Lauderdale International Airport. After two more interchanges, one with Sunrise Boulevard (SR 838) in Plantation and Commercial Boulevard (SR 870) in Tamarac, it crosses the Cypress Creek Toll Plaza in North Lauderdale, the second on the mainline. Just north of the toll plaza, it intersects with the Pompano Beach Service Plaza, the first of seven full-service plazas on the mainline, and where the Turnpike&#x27;s operations center is located. Still in Pompano Beach, it has a northbound-only exit (and southbound-only entrance) at Atlantic Boulevard (SR 814), followed by full interchanges with Coconut Creek Parkway/Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (County Road 912) (exit 67) and Sample Road (SR 834) (exit 69). North of exit 69, the road is no longer illuminated by streetlights but rather only at interchanges, near service plazas, and some urban areas (like near Orlando). It then enters Deerfield Beach with an interchange with the Sawgrass Expressway in Coconut Creek (exit 71), the final interchange in Broward County. The Turnpike then enters Palm Beach County, with one interchange each in Boca Raton (Glades Road, exit 75), Delray Beach (Atlantic Avenue, exit 81) and Boynton Beach (Boynton Beach Boulevard, exit 86).

The turnpike narrows to a four-lane highway as it goes through a less developed portion of Palm Beach County, crossing interchanges with Lake Worth Road, followed by the Lake Worth/West Palm Beach Service Plaza at mile marker 94. In West Palm Beach, the highway has interchanges with US 98/SR 80 (Southern Boulevard), a SunPass-only interchange at Jog Road, followed by an interchange at Okeechobee Boulevard (exit 99) that heads directly into downtown West Palm Beach. North of the interchange, the highway enters stretch of sparse development between this point and Port St. Lucie, intersecting with the Beeline Highway, another SunPass only interchange before leaving West Palm Beach. Just north of the SR 786 interchange in Palm Beach Gardens (exit 109), I-95 parallels the Turnpike to the east for about , with I-95 visible from the turnpike as it has an interchange with SR 706 (exit 116) in Jupiter and into Martin County. It breaks off as it crosses the Thomas B. Manuel Bridge over the St. Lucie Canal, crossing I-95 without an interchange just south of the SR 714 interchange, the only exit in Martin County. I-95 heads west towards the western fringes of St. Lucie County development, while the turnpike takes a path through the central areas of the county. The turnpike has two interchanges in Port St. Lucie, one at Becker Road (exit 138), the third SunPass-only exit, and SR 716 (exit 142), followed by the Port St. Lucie-Fort Pierce service plaza at mile marker 144. The turnpike intersects I-95 one last time just south of SR 70 (exit 152) in Fort Pierce, as I-95 continues to head up the east coast of Florida and the turnpike curves inland towards Orlando.

===Ft. Pierce to Wildwood===
North of the SR 70 interchange, the turnpike enters a rural area, with cattle farms and orange groves lining the road for most of the section between Fort Pierce and Kissimmee, with only one interchange: SR 60 in Yeehaw Junction (exit 193). There are two service plazas in this area, one at Fort Drum at mile marker 184 and the other, Canoe Creek, at mile marker 229. Between Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction, the turnpike travels in a nearly east-west direction heading inland, with a gap between the two exits, the second longest of any US expressway. Between Yeehaw Junction and Kissimmee, the turnpike, returning to a north-northwest direction towards Orlando, has a ( southbound) stretch without an exit, the longest of any US expressway. It then passes exit 240 located at Clay Whaley Road, a partial interchange featuring a northbound on- and southbound off-ramp only. After interchanges with US 192/US 441 (exit 242 northbound, exit 244 southbound) and the Osceola Parkway (exit 249), the turnpike enters Orange County and Orlando, expanding to eight lanes north of the latter interchange and quickly intersecting SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay) (exit 251). Exit 254 in Sky Lake is a massive combined interchange with both US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway), which combines a series of partial cloverleaf interchanges with access ramps from side roads. The turnpike then intersects with Consulate Drive (southbound exit 255) and SR 482 (Sand Lake Road) (future exit 257).
After passing the I-4 interchange (exit 259) near many of Orlando&#x27;s theme parks, connecting directly with the I-4 express lanes to and from the east along I-4, the Turnpike moves in a northwest direction, first passing by the Turkey Lake Service Plaza at mile marker 263, where the FDOT district headquarters of the Turnpike are located. The Turnpike has the next two interchanges with Orlando area tollways, SR 408 (East-West Expressway) at exit 265 and SR 429 (Western Expressway) at exit 267A, where in between the two exits, the turnpike expands to become a twelve-lane highway, and reverting to an eight-lane highway north of the SR 429 interchange. The last two Orange County interchanges are with SR 50 five miles apart at exit 267B and 272, with the turnpike becoming a four-lane highway north of exit 272, and staying that way for the rest of its northward journey. The Turnpike then enters Lake County, heading in a northwestern direction, where hilly countryside becomes a part of the terrain for the remainder of the expressway while intersecting with Hancock Road (exit 278) in Minneola, an electronic toll interchange. At mile 285, it has a northbound exit/southbound entrance with US 27, followed by the Leesburg electronic toll gantry at mile 288, and a southbound exit/northbound entrance with US 27 at mile 289. The last interchange in Lake County is with County Road 470 (exit 296), which does not provide cash.
At mile marker 299, the turnpike passes through the final service plaza, the Okahumpka service plaza. Between US 301 (exit 304) and the northern terminus (mile 309) there is no toll. The turnpike ends with an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood, about south of Ocala. Exit 307 at SR 44 provides access to southbound I-75 through that interstate&#x27;s exit 329, while northbound I-75 travelers (and bidirectional SR 44 travelers) can access the turnpike at this exit.

==Tolls==
Tolls on the turnpike are an average of for cars and other two-axle vehicles using SunPass. A trip on the entire turnpike (not including the Homestead Extension) would cost $22.59 with Toll-by-Plate, and $17.45 with SunPass.

The turnpike was originally entirely on the ticket system, but due to congestion in the Miami and Orlando metro areas, a barrier toll system was implemented from the Three Lakes toll plaza north to the terminus at I-75, and from Lantana south to I-95, in the 1990s.

The SunPass electronic toll collection system, in use since 1999, has become the primary method of paying tolls on the turnpike, with 80% of customers using the system . SunPass can be used on most Florida toll roads, in conjunction with other electronic toll collection systems in Florida (E-Pass and LeeWay). SunPass users benefit from an average of a 25% discount on tolls and access to SunPass-only exit ramps. SunPass transponders are available at the gift shop and gas stations at all service plazas, as well as Walgreens, Publix, and CVS stores statewide. Since 2021, E-ZPass, which is used primarily in the Midwest and Northeast U.S., has also been accepted on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike.

As the Turnpike and its system of roads are primary routes for emergency evacuations, tolls &quot;may&quot; be suspended, in cooperation with the state&#x27;s emergency operations center and county governments, when a state or national emergency, most common being a hurricane watch, warrant rapid movement of the population.

==Services==

===Service plazas===
Eight service plazas are located along the turnpike, spaced about apart. All eight plazas are open 24 hours a day and located on the center median of the turnpike for access from both directions and offer gasoline, diesel fuel, internet access, travel and tourism info and tickets, picnic areas, TV news, gift shops offering Florida Lottery, family-friendly restrooms, and pay phones. A convenience store/gas station is located at the Snapper Creek plaza on the Homestead Extension of the turnpike, while the remaining seven are full-service plazas, featuring a selection of franchised fast food restaurants. Three of the service plazas (Pompano, Port St. Lucie/Fort Pierce, Turkey Lake) also provide E85 ethanol. The Turkey Lake, Ft. Drum plaza, Canoe Creek, Okahumpa, Port St. Lucie, West Palm Beach, and Pompano Beach plazas also have Tesla Superchargers for Tesla electric vehicles.

The operation of Sunshine State Parkway gas stations and service centers was originally bid out under separate contracts, and as a result, differing petroleum brands operated concurrently along the parkway, with varying levels of service and pricing. This practice was discontinued in 1995 when all service center operations were combined to improve supply and continuity of service; with Martin Petroleum, a Florida corporation, operating the stations with Citgo brand fuel at its stations. Since then, the Venezuelan government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized Citgo, and in 2006, political controversy resulted in a movement to remove the brand from the turnpike.

In 2009, Areas U.S.A. signed a 30-year contract for operation of food and retail concessions, taking over operations from Martin Petroleum and HMSHost. Florida Turnpike Services, L.L.C., Areas&#x27; partner, replaced the Citgo brand with Shell, the current brand for gas stations along the turnpike. Many of the restaurant brands were also changed over, with Dunkin&#x27; Donuts replacing Starbucks locations as well as KFC, Pizza Hut, Villa Pizza and Wendy&#x27;s replacing most Popeyes and Burger King locations. The reconstruction and renovation of six of the service plazas began on November 1, 2010, to be completed in 2012. The Okahumpka and Ft. Pierce plazas will begin reconstruction when the other plaza projects are complete. Total renovation costs are estimated at $160 million.

===Intelligent transportation systems===
Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise operates with intelligent transportation systems (ITS), used to detect and manage incidents on their roadways. The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMCs), one in Pompano Beach and the other in Ocoee, operated by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system, consisting of closed-circuit television traffic cameras, dynamic message signs, highway advisory radio, and radar vehicle detection system, allow the TMC to see anything from congestion to crashes, to disabled vehicles that may pose a threat to the Turnpike&#x27;s motorists. When necessary, the TMC will activate the dynamic message signs and highway advisory radio stations to alert motorists of the potential situation, as well as AMBER/Silver Alerts.

===Road Rangers===
The Road Rangers Safety Patrol offers free roadside assistance on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike mainline and Homestead Extension. Utility and tow trucks patrol 12 designated zones looking for stranded motorists to provide services such as fuel, tire changes, and use of a cellular phone; and also watching out for crashes and road debris. The Traffic Management Center dispatches them to accidents, debris removal, disabled vehicles, or anything that may potentially affect the traveling public; they also assist the Florida Highway Patrol with traffic maintenance during incidents involving blockage of lanes.

==History==

===Planning===

In the years following World War II, Florida was experiencing unprecedented growth in population and tourism, along with a revitalized citrus industry recovering from a harsh freeze early in the decade; the increased traffic load quickly burdened the state&#x27;s highway system. South Florida businessman and accounting firm owner Charles B. Costar was concerned that a trip down the east coast of Florida would take days on the available road network, passing through every small beachside town and siphoning off the traffic before visitors reached South Florida. After driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike during a vacation there, he envisioned a similar high-speed turnpike in Florida. In 1953, Costar led a lobbying group that resulted in the state legislature creating the &quot;Florida Turnpike Act&quot;, which Governor Dan McCarty signed into law on July 11, 1953, as well as the Florida State Turnpike Authority, which had the ability to plan, design, and construct bond-financed toll roads, in whose creation Costar was instrumental, to be repaid through the collection of tolls from Turnpike customers.

Thomas B. Manuel, known as the &quot;Father of the Turnpike&quot;, served as chairman of the Florida State Turnpike Authority from January 1955 to January 1961. Manuel debated with state legislature members opposed to tollways, emphasizing the need for a good highway system in a tourism-driven state. During the 1955 legislative session, many small-county legislators and others opposed to the Parkway formed a &quot;kill the &#x27;Pike&#x27;&quot; coalition; Manuel won over the legislators at his headquarters in the Floridan Hotel near the capitol. Only four votes against the turnpike were entered at the end of the session&#x27;s roll call, and the Legislature granted permission to build with a $70 million bond issue in June 1955. A Turnpike bridge in Stuart bears his name to honor his contributions.

===Original construction===
Construction on the Parkway began on July 4, 1955, starting at what is now the Golden Glades Interchange. In October 1956, all work on the Sunshine State Parkway north of Ft. Pierce was abandoned and plans for a state-long turnpike were shelved due to passage of the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act, which provided for construction of limited-access highways in the corridors that had been under study for the Parkway Extension. One was Interstate 95, which was slated to connect Jacksonville with Miami in a similar alignment to the planned Sunshine State Parkway Coastal Route. This resulted in completion of a truncated highway that ran from Miami to Fort Pierce, opening on January 25, 1957.

In January 1959, Governor LeRoy Collins, favoring a Parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Orlando, stated that building the Parkway north of Orlando would be unnecessary due to the interstate highway system. In late May 1959, the board authorized a study for the Parkway Extension to Orlando, and connecting the Interstate routes in Florida. In 1961, Governor Collins approved the sale of $80 million in bonds to finance the parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Wildwood, adding another of roadway and shifting Interstate 75&#x27;s route eastward from its original alignment. The extension was opened in three stages: a section between Yeehaw Junction and Orlando opened on July 17, 1963, a section linking Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction opened on November 22, 1963, and the section between Orlando and the northern terminus of I-75 opened on July 24, 1964, completing the mainline.

With the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; in 1963, a team led by Martin Waldron wrote a total of 150,000 words as part of the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of unchecked spending by the Florida Turnpike Authority that led to estimated costs quadrupling from initial estimates of $100 million. Waldron received a tip about excessive spending by John Hammer, chairman of the Florida Turnpike Authority, which included expensive hotels and meals, corsages for his secretary and overcharging for a chartered plane. His coverage earned the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1964, the first for the newspaper, and led to changes in the way the state of Florida managed highway construction projects.

===Since completion===

For just over 11 years, the road was known as the Sunshine State Parkway (SSP). On April 12, 1968, the road was renamed to its current name of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, to identify that the toll road was located in Florida and to avoid confusion from other Florida landmarks such as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. The Sunshine State Parkway moniker was commonly used for the next decade, and remnants of the name can be seen on several Turnpike maintenance buildings.

The Florida Department of Transportation was created in July 1969, with the Florida State Turnpike Authority becoming a part of the new FDOT.

On September 1, 1971, the Turnpike switched from a sequential exit numbering system to a hybrid numbering system, where adjacent exit numbers differed by 4 south of SR 60 (exit 60 at the time) and 5 north of SR 60.

The Bureau of Public Roads approved an Interstate 95 alignment that used of the Turnpike from PGA Boulevard (SR 786) in Palm Beach Gardens north to SR 70 in Ft. Pierce in the 1950s. In the mid-1960s, the State Road Department authorized traffic counts be conducted to determine if the separation of Interstate 95 from the Turnpike was feasible, with arguments that using a concurrent alignment was costing Florida money for federal highway funding, but not without the concern of losing toll revenue. Over time, the interstate adopted a route closer to U.S. Route 1, including parallel between Stuart and Palm Beach Gardens, with the turnpike being removed from the I-95 alignment in 1973, and I-95 being completed in 1987.

With Florida still growing in population in the 1960s, preliminary studies began for expanding portions of the Turnpike to six lanes in South Florida and additional north–south highways in that area. Dade County and the State Road Department developed a plan for the West Dade Expressway (now known as the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike), beginning at the Turnpike near the Dade County/Broward County line, turning westward and southward, and terminating at Florida City in southern Dade County. In 1967, the Florida State Turnpike Authority was authorized to perform engineering and feasibility studies on the West Dade Expressway and the Bee Line Connector extension, now known as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway. The results of the studies came in December 1968, but due to an uncertain bond market and an unknown future for the toll authority, decisions on the roads were delayed. In 1969, FDOT and Orange and Dade County officials agreed the Bee Line Connector and Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike would be financed by revenue bond issues as extensions of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. The Beeline Expressway opened in 1973 and the Homestead Extension opened in 1974 as a part of the Turnpike mainline.

Between 1974 and 1986, the turnpike experienced little change other than maintenance as the original bonds on the road were being paid off. During this period, the turnpike experienced the first of five toll hikes on February 15, 1979, when the cost of a trip from Golden Glades to Wildwood increased to $5.90 from $4.80, the road&#x27;s original toll.

In 1989, the Turnpike switched its exit numbering system to the mile-log system, starting from the south end of the Homestead Extension, 13 years before Florida&#x27;s interstates integrated it into their system.

In 1988, the Office of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike was formed, with $220 million worth of revenue bonds being sold in April 1989 to renovate the toll plazas, service centers and improve the road with the reduction of urban congestion. Four new interchanges were opened by July 1991. 

The section between the Golden Glades Plaza and Lantana was converted to a coin drop toll in 1990, the Cypress Creek and Lantana toll plazas were built as part of this project. Coin baskets were installed in 1994 after years of delays. 

The portion of road north of Kissimmee was converted to a coin drop system on August 20, 1995.

On July 7, 1995, the Leesburg toll barrier was opened. at this point, the existing Three Lakes toll plaza and Wildwood toll plazas were closed.

Because he &quot;was one of America&#x27;s most beloved presidents and a true world leader&quot;, as the Legislature put it, Florida&#x27;s Turnpike was designated by the Florida Legislature in 1998 as the Ronald Reagan Turnpike, with 20 signs throughout the turnpike showing the designation.

In April 1999, SunPass was introduced to the public, with SunPass-only interchanges and lanes being introduced throughout the 2000s. 

Between 2005 and 2012, the Turnpike spent $380 million doubling the number of lanes from SR 528 to the northernmost interchange with SR 50 west of Winter Garden (exit 272). Most of the section was expanded from four to eight lanes, with the section between SR 408 and SR 429 being expanded from six to twelve lanes. The portion between SR 528 and Interstate 4 opened in 2008, with the portion between I-4 and SR 408 being finished in 2010, SR 408 to Beulah Road (at the north end of the SR 429 interchange) opened in March 2011, and the portion between Beulah Road and SR 50 (exit 272) was completed in 2012.

The HEFT ceased cash toll collections on February 19, 2011, becoming an exclusive electronic toll road, a move announced in November 2009. The staffed toll plazas were converted into electronic toll gantries, and the only ways to pay are either by SunPass transponders or a &quot;toll-by-plate&quot; program. The Turnpike mainline began its conversion to a cashless toll road with the Golden Glades toll barrier being converted into a toll gantry on January 25, 2014, and no longer accepts cash. The portion south of I-595 was converted on August 29, 2015.
In 2007, legislation was passed in Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted by the end of June 2012. As a result, the toll rates on roads on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. The legislation allows for SunPass rates to be raised slightly each year, with cash rates going up every five years, with SunPass rates staying about a quarter cheaper than cash rates. In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%, with cash toll rates projected to stay the same through at least 2014. Toll rate increases were scheduled for every five years, and mid-2017 was the next scheduled date for such an increase. However, a combination of a low inflation rate and problems within the relevant state authorities caused multiple cancellations and changes in schedule for the next increase. The final projected date for an increase in tolls was eventually set for October 29, 2017.

Reconstruction of the northern end of the Turnpike at its junction with Interstate 75 improved the traffic merge pattern between I-75 and SR 44 with new flyover ramps and additional traffic lanes. The northbound off-ramp to SR 44 was completed on September 19, 2019, while southbound on-ramp construction was completed in early November 2019, and the project overall was completed in early January 2020.

The Turnpike Enterprise and OOCEA (now CFX) agreed to build a partial interchange between SR 417 and Florida&#x27;s Turnpike in the late 2000s, after negotiations dating back to a 1991 field study. The interchange is being built in two phases. The first phase, built by CFX, added ramps from southbound SR 417 to southbound Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and from northbound Florida&#x27;s Turnpike to northbound SR 417. Construction on the first phase began in September 2013 and opened on January 26, 2015. The second phase, completing the interchange, was built by the Turnpike Enterprise. After a series of delays, construction began in 2017 and the completed interchange was fully opened on May 21, 2021. As part of the project, the turnpike mainline was widened from four to eight lanes between Osceola Parkway (exit 249) and the Beachline Expressway (SR 528, exit 255).
Additional projects to convert the turnpike to an electronic collection system were completed between I-595 and Lantana in 2019, and from SR 429 north to I-75 in Wildwood in 2020. The final stretch of the turnpike to use the ticket system ran between what are now electronic toll gantries at Lantana (mile 89.4 in Palm Beach County) and Three Lakes (mile 236.5 in Osceola County). This section was converted to a cashless system on November 8, 2021, removing the final cash-based toll collections and converting the entire length of the turnpike to electronic toll collection.

==Future==

Plans are in the works to widen the Turnpike from the Lake Worth Road interchange (exit 93) to the State Road 70 exit (exit 152) and from SR 50 (exit 272) to U.S. 27 (northbound exit 285) from four to eight lanes. In Miami-Dade County, several widening projects including new through lanes are underway.

There are plans to widen the Turnpike from Kissimmee Park Road (exit 240) to US 192 (exit 242) and from Neptune Road to just north of Osceola Parkway (exit 249) all from four to eight lanes. A new diverging diamond interchange will be constructed at Nolte Road during this process. Construction is funded for the 2024 fiscal year.

The Turnpike Enterprise is also studying a possible developer-funded future interchange at County Road 468 (mile marker 300, servicing The Villages and Lady Lake). This project is neither funded nor scheduled for construction at this time.

There has been discussion of creating a northern extension. 

==Exit list==

North of the HEFT–Mainline interchange, the mainline continues the mileage from mile 47 from the HEFT. The spur of the mainline south of the HEFT to the Golden Glades Interchange assumes an alternate numbering system that suffixes an &quot;X&quot; to each exit number.

<doc id="716619" wikidata="Q650381" url="?curid=716619" title="Treaty of Wedmore">
<text>The Treaty of Wedmore is a 9th century agreement between King Alfred the Great of Wessex and the Viking king, Guthrum the Old. The only contemporary reference to the treaty is that of a Welsh monk, Asser, in his biography of Alfred, known as &quot;Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum&quot;, or &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;, in which Asser describes how after Guthrum&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Edington, followed by his surrender some days later, he agreed to a peace treaty with Alfred. The treaty was conditional on Guthrum&#x27;s being baptised to endorse the agreement, as well as to allow him to rule more legitimately over his Christian vassals but to remain pagan to his pagan vassals. Also, Guthrum and his army were to leave Wessex.

== Sources and historical context ==
According to Asser, in his biography of King Alfred, known as &quot;Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum&quot;, or &quot;The Life of King Alfred&quot;, in 878 Alfred defeated the Viking Great Army at the Battle of Edington. Guthrum, the Viking leader, retreated with the remnants of his army to their &quot;stronghold&quot;, where Alfred besieged him.

After fourteen days the Vikings, according to Asser: 
Alfred accepted Guthrum&#x27;s surrender and the Vikings gave Alfred peace hostages: 
Three weeks later Guthrum and thirty of his most important men went to Alfred at Aller, near Athelney. There Guthrum was baptised, with Alfred accepting him as his adoptive son. The unbinding of the chrisom, part of a baptismal ritual, took place eight days later at the royal estate and church at Wedmore near Cheddar.

Guthrum adopted the baptismal name of Athelstan. The following twelve days Guthrum and his chiefs stayed with Alfred where they were honoured with gifts and feasting. During the summer of 878, Guthrum&#x27;s army remained in Chippenham. Then, as agreed Guthrum and his army moved out of Wessex, and travelled the relatively short distance to Cirencester (in the Kingdom of Mercia) and then eventually on to East Anglia.

== Misinterpretation and confusion ==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for 878 has a similar description to Asser. It details Alfred&#x27;s movements before, during and after the Battle of Edington. It describes Guthrum&#x27;s surrender, his baptism at Wedmore and the twelve days of celebration. The only reference to an accord at Wedmore is that from Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;. If there was a formal treaty, contemporary with the events at Wedmore in 878, no such document still exists. A truce was made and, at a later date, a formal treaty was agreed. This one was known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum and it defines the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum&#x27;s territories, as well as agreements on peaceful trade and the weregild value of its people. This document still survives and is part of the Laws of Alfred. The treaty is seen as a precursor to the formation of Danelaw.

The Treaty of Wedmore and the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum have often been confused with each other. It is possible that the Treaty of Wedmore in 878, by which Guthrum had to accept baptism and leave Wessex, was a verbal agreement. The formal, written Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, dividing up the kingdoms, followed some years later.

<doc id="716628" wikidata="Q6260956" url="?curid=716628" title="John Todd (Canadian biologist)">
<text>John Todd (born 1939) is a Canadian biologist working in the general field of ecological design. 
He addresses problems of food production and wastewater processing by using ecosystems technologies that incorporate plants, animals and bacteria. Todd has developed &quot;Arks&quot; or &quot;bioshelters&quot;, ecologically closed &quot;life-support systems&quot; with the goal of sustainable functioning. He combines alternative technologies for renewable energy, organic farming, aquaculture, hydroponics and architecture to create &quot;living machines&quot;
or &quot;eco-machines&quot;.

John Todd is a co-founder with Nancy Jack Todd of the non-profits New Alchemy Institute (1969–1991) and Ocean Arks International (1981),
and the founder and president of the design and engineering firm John Todd Ecological Design Inc. (1989).
A research professor emeritus and distinguished lecturer at the University of Vermont,
Todd has published books on ecological design, as well as over 200 scientific papers, popular articles and essays.

==Early life and education==
Todd was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1939 and grew up near Hamilton Bay on Lake Ontario. The area near his home included marshes and streams which were being badly damaged by pollution. The writings of Louis Bromfield offered Todd a &quot;marvelous tale of hope&quot; about the possibility of land restoration.

Todd earned his B.Sc. (1961) in agriculture and his M.Sc. (1963) in parasitology and tropical medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He then did doctoral work in marine biology at the University of Michigan, studying fisheries and oceanography. 
His early professional interest in the behavioral ecology of fish was the basis of his work as an assistant professor of ethology at San Diego State University (1968–1970).

==Career==
John Todd joined the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, as an assistant scientist in 1970.
At Woods Hole, John Todd began to develop his ideas about how complicated biological food chains worked. 
An important influence on Todd&#x27;s thinking was his wife, Nancy Jack Todd, a dancer, writer, editor and activist. In their conversations Nancy wondered if ecological concepts could be applied to address people&#x27;s needs. She encouraged John Todd to put &quot;a human face&quot; on his research. 
Since then, the couple have edited and co-written several books, and are co-recipients of a number of awards.

===New Alchemy Institute===
In 1969 the Todds and William O. McLarney co-founded the New Alchemy Institute in Cape Cod, Massachusetts
to &quot;engage in scientific research in the public interest on ecologically and behaviourally planned agriculture systems and rural land based communities.&quot;
The institute was a &quot;fusion of technology and counterculture&quot;.
Its members proposed to apply principles and design strategies from the biological sciences to technology in ways that would be economically and environmentally sustainable. 
Although the New Alchemy Institute dissolved in 1991,
it has been described as &quot;a catalyst of change promoting the development of new ecological design solutions, alternative technologies and methods of ecological food production and waste treatment.&quot;

One of the approaches they developed was the concept of bioshelters, &quot;greenhouse-like architectural structures containing ecosystems for various purposes: food for humans, waste purification systems, etc.&quot;
Wendell Berry wrote admiringly: &quot;The bioshelter idea, then, proposes to make a household on the pattern of an ecosystem, adapted to the local landscape and climate, using local materials... Its governing principle is symbiosis: the food production system heats the house; the fish tanks raise fish, heat the greenhouse, provide irrigation water and fertilizer for the plants.&quot;
The idea that the wastes created in one part of a system provide valuable resources for another part of the system is fundamental to the design of such sustainable ecosystems.

===Ocean Arks International===
In 1981, Todd co-founded the non-profit Ocean Arks International (OAI).
The original idea behind Ocean Arks was to build wind-powered vessels capable of carrying ecological materials and support technologies, for use in countries throughout the developing world. Such a vision was beyond the reach of the organization.

Todd began to focus on other concerns relating to water, in particular the development of alternative approaches to conventional waste treatment. He applied ideas from aquaculture and organic agriculture to wastewater. His approach was to identify ecological pathways through which nutrients from waste could be recycled. Waste from one organism could become a food source for subsequent organisms, instead of being discarded as an unusable and toxic by-product.

The first &quot;Solar Aquatics System&quot; (SAS) for wastewater treatment was an experimental pilot at the Sugarbush Ski resort near Warren, Vermont, around 1986.

During the 1990s, Todd was involved in several attempts to start companies for the technologies he envisioned. The personnel, financing and technologies involved in these companies overlap in complicated and confusing ways, with each other and with Ocean Arks International. The term &quot;Living Machines&quot; was filed for registration as a wordmark in 1991, and was registered to Ocean Arks International in 1993 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

===Ecological Engineering Associates, Inc.===
Ecological Engineering Associates, Inc. (EEA) was founded in Marion, Massachusetts in 1988 as a commercial venture to more effectively promote the work of Ocean Arks International. 
Susan B. Peterson, previously an employee of OAI, became EEA&#x27;s first president.
Co-founder John Todd preferred not to serve on its board, but was involved as an &quot;ecological designer&quot;.

EEA designed and installed a wastewater plant to remediate septage lagoons at Harwich, Massachusetts (see below). Work began in 1988, and the system became operational in 1990.
EEA developed several other projects, using transparent water columns for treatment units in its &quot;solar aquatic systems&quot;. 
Patents for processes relating to solar aquatics were filed under the inventor names of John Todd and Barry Silverstein in 1988 and 1991, and granted to EEA.
EEA registered the trademark &quot;Solar Aquatic&quot; specifically for waste treatment tanks with transparent water columns. 

===Living Technologies Inc.===
Todd also co-founded Living Technologies Inc. (LTI), an ecological design, engineering, and construction company, in Burlington, Vermont. It was incorporated as a company on October 26, 1994, in the state of Florida. Some of the personnel involved in Living Technologies, including president Michael Shaw, had connections to OAI and to a prior company called Advanced Greenhouse Systems (AGS) which had been established in 1989 by William Rapp, also in Burlington Vermont. Two patents for Ecological Fluidized Beds (EFB) were filed by John Todd and Michael Shaw in 1993 and 1995. The patents were granted to OAI in 1996 and 1997. EFBs were used in the design of what were increasingly referred to as living machines.

In 1997, Living Technologies Inc. sought a second round of funding, which it obtained from Tom Worrell. In 1998, there was considerable reorganization of the company and its board. Worrell assumed ownership of the company in 1999 and acquired the rights to the original patents for Todd&#x27;s &quot;Living Machine&quot;. As of December 2000, in an out-of-court settlement, Worrell obtained the sole right to use &quot;Living Machine&quot; as a proprietary term. Worrell&#x27;s company went through a number of name changes and relocations. Worrell Water Technologies, LLC of Charlottesville, Virginia currently holds the registered trademark for the name Living Machine. Worrell Water Technologies has redesigned Todd&#x27;s original systems and patented a number of new technologies since 2002.

===John Todd Ecological Design Inc.===
In 1989, Todd incorporated &quot;John Todd Research and Design&quot; in Falmouth, Massachusetts. It later became &quot;John Todd Ecological Design&quot; (JTED).
Through this company, Todd has developed his own later-generation wastewater treatment systems, under the name &quot;Eco-machines&quot;.
As of 2014, John Todd Ecological Design registered the trademark for the term &quot;Eco-machines&quot;.
Todd&#x27;s son, Jonathan Todd, is the president of John Todd Ecological Design.

===University of Vermont===
Todd taught at the University of Vermont as a guest lecturer beginning in 1997. He became a research professor in 1999. He is now a research professor emeritus and distinguished lecturer.

==Ecological design==
Todd and his colleagues were some of the first people to actually create miniature ecosystems, largely self-perpetuating, which applied ecological principles to address human needs. 
Todd&#x27;s approach is one of biomimicry, in which a complex natural ecosystem such as a marsh is studied, recreated and adapted.
Learning from the natural system, the ecological designer combines micro-organisms, fish, and plants into a functionally complex system that is capable of carrying out tasks such as bioremediation and phytoremediation.

Todd emphasized the importance of establishing an ecosystem with a large number of diverse species and then allowing it to &quot;settle&quot; to a stable state, a process that could take weeks, months, or even years. He recommended seeding the ecosystem with local species, ones that had already demonstrated an ability to withstand conditions in the target environment.
He sought to create systems that were capable of self-organizing and displaying emergent properties. Such systems are of necessity complex and cannot be well understood in terms of simple reductionism.

Todd has applied these ideas in various ways, to create types of applications including &quot;bioshelters&quot; or &quot;arks&quot;, 
&quot;ecological treatment systems&quot; (ETS),
&quot;advanced ecologically engineered systems&quot; (AEES)
&quot;living machines&quot;, 
and &quot;eco-machines&quot;.

===Water===
This work has resulted in innovative new approaches to processing wastewater and sewage.

Todd and colleagues developed what they called &quot;living machines&quot;. These systems are ecologically engineered technologies developed to restore, conserve, or remediate polluted water, by replicating and accelerating the natural purification processes of streams, ponds and marshes. In practical application, a living machine is a self-contained treatment system designed to treat a specific waste stream using the principles of ecological engineering. 
It does this by creating diverse communities of bacteria and other microorganisms, algae, plants, trees, snails, fish and other living creatures in a series of tanks. 
The EPA has concluded that this approach is appropriate to the treatment of municipal and some industrial types of wastewater, and that it can be competitive in cost compared to more conventional systems.

===Sewage===
Greenhouse waste treatment plants such as the ones John Todd has developed can yield clean water from sewage. Bacteria consume the organic sewage and turn ammonia into nitrates. The nitrates are used as food for algae and fertilizer for duckweed. Zooplankton and snails consume the algae. Fish eat the zooplankton. Floating plants soak up the leftovers. Bulrushes, cattails, and water hyacinths render the toxins harmless. Trees absorb heavy metals. The byproducts are decorative plants and minnows, both of which are sold. The minnows are sold as bait fish. Aquatic plants, raised in the system&#x27;s open-air lagoons for sewer treatment, are used in California, Florida, and Mississippi. 
By enclosing such a system within a greenhouse, it becomes possible to do this in the colder northern climates as well.

== Projects ==
Todd&#x27;s waste treatment systems have been implemented for sites in at least nine countries, in both the industrialized and developing world.
Sites include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Hungary, India, Scotland, and the United States.
A number of projects have been particularly noteworthy because of the introduction of new concepts or major achievements.

=== The Cape Cod Ark ===
Soon after its founding in 1969, the New Alchemy Institute began to develop its first experimental environment, eventually known as the &quot;Cape Cod Ark&quot;, at their headquarters in Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Their goals were to process wastewater and to explore the potential for food production.

A series of solar ponds, each with its own ecosystem, processes wastewater and uses recaptured materials to farm fish and to grow vegetables and fruits. These include papaya trees, eggplants, tomatoes, and herbs. Computers were introduced to monitor and study the processes of remediation, energy use, and food production. Heating and electricity needs were met using renewable energy sources. The system was enclosed within a greenhouse, designed by architects Sean Wellesley-Miller and Day Chahroudi, so that it could operate year-round.

When the New Alchemy Institute dissolved in 1991, the Cape Cod Ark became the property of a private co-housing community. In 1999, it was taken over by Hilde Maingay and Earle Barnhart, two of the co-founders of the New Alchemy Institute. Working with architect Ate Atema, they upgraded the structure and added an energy-efficient house to the original greenhouse. Under their care, the 1800 square feet Ark became a self-sustaining home, supporting humans, plants, fishes and animals year-round. The Cape Cod Ark was still their home as of 2021. Having provided both an experimental testbed for New Alchemy&#x27;s ideas, and a sustainable home for two of its founding members for over 15 years, the Cape Cod Ark has been referred to as &quot;New Alchemy’s crowning achievement&quot;.

=== The Prince Edward Island Ark ===
In 1974 Todd returned to Canada to design and build &quot;An ARK for P.E.I.&quot; at Spry Point, Kings County on Prince Edward Island, with financial support from the federal and provincial governments. 
Completed by David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund of Solsearch Architects and the New Alchemy Institute, the Ark gained national attention.
It was officially opened by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on September 21, 1976.

The Ark was an attempt to re-examine the relationship between people and nature. It also gave the New Alchemists an opportunity to test their ideas in a very cold climate.
Differing expectations about the project caused difficulties. Because the experimental nature of the Ark had been de-emphasized, the technological problems that occurred became particularly embarrassing. Also, many Canadians expected the publicly funded installation to be viewable as a demonstration project for renewable energy and sustainable living. In contrast, the New Alchemists onsite saw it as a private research installation and tried to discourage visitors. In 1977, New Alchemists David Bergmark and Nancy Willis moved out, ending the experiment in sustainable living. The Ark was supervised for two more years by Ken MacKay, a biologist hired by the provincial government&#x27;s Institute of Man and Resources (IMR), and then closed in 1981.

Nonetheless, the Ark was an important test bed for many of the principles that were later applied to &quot;living machines&quot;, as well as a number of trail-blazing and now established green or sustainable technologies: solar orientation, solar collectors, wind energy, thermal energy storage, and composting toilets. Historian Henry Trim emphasizes the Ark&#x27;s impact on Canadian culture, helping &quot;to introduce Canadians to renewable energy and organic foods as well as pioneering green architecture, aquaponics, and sustainable farming.&quot;

Although it was demolished in 2000, the Ark has been called one of &quot;Prince Edward Island’ s two most iconic works of modern architecture&quot;. In 2016, it was commemorated in the exhibit &quot;Living lightly on the earth: building an Ark for Prince Edward Island, 1974-76&quot; at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

=== Harwich, Massachusetts ===
In 1988, the town of Harwich, Massachusetts hosted a four-month pilot of one of Todd&#x27;s lagoon systems, involving 21 solar aquatic ponds and a constructed marsh. The pilot&#x27;s success encouraged further involvement with Ecological Engineering Associates. For Todd, it was a &quot;watershed moment&quot;, an important proof of concept for the ecological design approach. &quot;After the successful first trials, I knew that it was possible to do good things in bad places; in short, to heal the planet.&quot;

By 1990 a full-scale project was being planned for Harwich&#x27;s Flax Pond, a 15-acre site. The pond suffered from significant contamination due to leachates from a nearby landfill and septage lagoons. Oxygen levels in the water were low and coliform bacteria counts were high. Sediment deposits included high levels of ammonia, up to 300 times the usual levels of phosphorus, and 80 times the usual concentration of iron.

A floating construction called a Pond Restorer was completed in 1992. Using a windmill and solar panels as energy sources, it drew up 100,000 gallons of water per day from the bottom of the pond. The water was sent through a series of columns involving a variety of substrates, bacterial and mineral amendments, freshwater clams, and terrestrial plants. A positive oxygen regime was restored to the bottom of the pond, and sediment depth was significantly reduced by 1995.

In the later 1990s, the design was modified to create an &quot;advanced ecologically engineered system&quot; (AEES). Large reductions in phosphorus, ammonia, and iron occurred between 1999 and 2001. 
Beginning in June 2001, the original structure was replaced with the first large-scale wastewater application of floating AEES Restorers. Twelve Restorers are arranged across the lagoon, in a pattern designed to promote a serpentine water flow. The installation incorporates 25,000 plants from 25 native species to remediate waste.

=== Findhorn Ecovillage, Moray, Scotland ===

The first &quot;Living Machine&quot; was created at Findhorn Ecovillage in Moray, Scotland in 1995. 
For its design, John Todd drew on the work of Käthe Seidel and H.T. Odum. 
The system had to accommodate wastewater from an ongoing population of about 300 residents, and a seasonally fluctuating population of as many as 10,000 visitors per year. 
The resulting installation resembles a tropical conservatory garden.
Every organism provides food for the next step in the food chain until the cycle is complete.

As a first-generation system, the Findhorn installation has undergone numerous changes. During its first fifteen years of operation it passed regular quality checks from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), and was never out of compliance.

=== South Burlington, Vermont ===
The Vermont Advanced Ecologically Engineered System (AEES) was one of four AEES demonstration projects created with funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The site in Chittenden County, near South Burlington, Vermont, was owned by the Massachusetts Institute for Excellence in Marine and Polymer Sciences, who received the grant. The project involved Living Technologies, Inc. as a subcontractor, and Ocean Arks International, with John Todd as principal investigator.

Project design began in 1994. The main construction was complete by December 1995, when the introduction of biological species began. 
A steady state of operation was established by May 1996 and continued to the end of 1999.
The plant was designed to treat 80,000 gallons from the city&#x27;s daily wastewater output of 200,000 gallons.

The Vermont AEES included wetlands for the extended aeration and treatment of activated sludge, with an active microbial community as well as plants, invertebrates, and fish. One of the goals of the project was to examine the approach&#x27;s usefulness in a cold climate. A greenhouse protected the plants. The installation contained two parallel trains of treatment tanks, for experimental comparisons of treatments. During the course of the project, the operators met all but one of the original design goals, and were able to improve on the original design as a result of experimenting with the tank configurations. 
The area was used as both an experimental and an educational center, and was appreciated for its &quot;uniquely beautiful aesthetic experience&quot;.

=== Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies ===
One of Todd&#x27;s Living Machines was a &quot;vital thread&quot; in the design of the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies at Oberlin College by David W. Orr in the 1990s.
While the Living Machines&#x27;s primary function was to treat wastewater, it was also intended to be a model of sustainability and ecological design for the teaching of Oberlin students. Oberlin students helped to design, install, and maintain the system.

Due to the complexity of the systems involved and issues in communication, a number of design oversights occurred during planning and construction. Limitations in available space and placement of features obstructed wetland flow, a brick wall with no functional purpose shaded some of the tanks, and some of the plants were in areas that had to be traversed by maintainers. Such problems decreased the system&#x27;s effectiveness, complicated its maintenance, and had to be addressed. Researchers also regretted that a single processing track was built, limiting their ability to establish parallel control and test conditions.

=== Omega Center for Sustainable Living ===

The Omega Center for Sustainable Living (OCSL) in Rhinebeck, New York, was opened on June 24, 2009. The building was designed by BNIM Architects, working with John Todd Ecological Design as the ecological architects.

Designed to be self-sustaining and carbon neutral, the building includes an Eco-machine for water reclamation. The Eco-machine&#x27;s 4,500-square-foot greenhouse and constructed wetland was designed to recycle about 5 million gallons of wastewater per year through the activity of plants, bacteria, algae, snails, and fungi.

In 2010, the Omega Center for Sustainable Living was one of two buildings world-wide to be the first fully certified &quot;living buildings&quot;, demonstrably achieving net zero energy usage and net zero wastewater production over a period of a year.

=== George D. Aiken Center, University of Vermont ===
As part of the green redesign of the Aiken Center at the University of Vermont, John Todd Ecological Design, Inc. supported the creation of the Aiken Center Eco Machine between 2006 and 2012. 
Much of the design work for the water treatment plant was done by Matt Beamas, one of Todd&#x27;s graduate students, who presented his master&#x27;s thesis on the work in 2010. In addition to treating all of the wastewater from the Aiken Center, the system provides opportunities for ongoing ecological design research at the school.
The wastewater system includes three separate trains, for experimental study of the system&#x27;s use.
The building is considered to be &quot;a national model for green renovation of a campus building&quot;. It has been awarded LEED Platinum certification.

==Recognition==
Todd&#x27;s work has inspired people working on the development of closed ecosystems for living in space, as well as on Earth.

Todd was profiled in &quot;Inventing Modern America&quot; (2002), published by the Lemelson-MIT Program for Invention and Innovation, in which the story of the development of his innovative ecological waste treatment systems is highlighted.

John Todd was the inaugural winner of the international Buckminster Fuller Challenge in 2008, for his proposal for a &quot;Comprehensive Design for a Carbon Neutral World: The Challenge of Appalachia&quot;. Todd put forward a program for the reclamation of more than one million acres of damaged land, through soil remediation, forestry, and the development of renewable energy.

Other awards that Todd has received include the Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design in 1994, and on April 22, 1996, an Environmental Merit Award (from the United States Environmental Protection Agency).

In 1998, the Todds received the Bioneers Lifetime Achievement Award. Also in 1998 they were the first couple to receive the Lindbergh Award in recognition of their work in technology and the environment. They are Fellows of the Findhorn Foundation. 
Todd is a fellow of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics.

<text>Dax (; ; ) is a commune in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, southwestern France, sub-prefecture of the Landes department.

It is known as a spa destination, specialising in mud treatment for rheumatism and similar ailments. Dax is also known for its bullfighting culture, especially during the August ferias, one of the most crowded festival events in France with 800,000 people attending over five days. It is also a market town, former bishopric and busy local centre, especially for the Chalosse area.

==Geography==
Dax lies on the river Adour, from the Atlantic Ocean and northwest of Bayonne. Dax station has rail connections to Paris, Hendaye, Tarbes, Bordeaux, Bayonne and Pau.

==History==
It was established by the Romans, and its reputation is supposed to date from a visit by Julia, the daughter of the first Emperor Octavian Augustus. Its Roman name was &quot;Civitas Aquensium&quot;. In the Middle Ages, it was administered by viscounts until 1177. From the acquisition of Aquitaine in 1152 by Henry II Plantagenet, later King of England, Dax remained under English rule until 1451, when it was conquered by French troops before the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It successfully withstood a Spanish siege in 1521-1522.

<text>Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma).

In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma. However, the medical community stresses that there is no such thing as a &#x27;benign melanoma&#x27; and recommends that the term &#x27;malignant melanoma&#x27; should be avoided as redundant.

About 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include increaseespecially rapid increasein size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.
The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.
Avoiding UV light and using sunscreen in UV-bright sun conditions may prevent melanoma. Treatment typically is removal by surgery of the melanoma and the potentially affected adjacent tissue bordering the melanoma. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread (metastasis). Most people are cured if metastasis has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment, the five-year survival rates in the United States are 99% among those with localized disease, 65% when the disease has spread to lymph nodes, and 25% among those with distant spread. The likelihood that melanoma will reoccur or spread depends on its thickness, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down.
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it newly occurred in 232,000 people. In 2015, 3.1 million people had active disease, which resulted in 59,800 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the United States, melanoma occurs about 1.6 times more often in men than women. Melanoma has become more common since the 1960s in areas mostly populated by people of European descent.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may itch, ulcerate, or bleed. Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic &quot;ABCDEEFG&quot;:
* Asymmetry
* Borders (irregular with edges and corners)
* Colour (variegated)
* Diameter (greater than , about the size of a pencil eraser)
* Evolving over time

This classification does not apply to nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:
* Elevated above the skin surface
* Firm to the touch
* Growing
Metastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Metastasis (spread) of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare; less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. Brain metastases are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma. It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen, or distant lymph nodes.

==Cause==
Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to UV light from the sun. Genetics also play a role. Melanoma can also occur in skin areas with little sun exposure (i.e. mouth, soles of feet, palms of hands, genital areas). People with dysplastic nevus syndrome, also known as familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma.

Having more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma. A weakened immune system makes cancer development easier due to the body&#x27;s weakened ability to fight cancer cells.

===UV radiation===
UV radiation exposure from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are &quot;carcinogenic to humans&quot; and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.

Those who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV.

UVB light, emanating from the sun at wavelengths between 315 and 280 nm, is absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells, which results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Thymine, cytosine, or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a strand of DNA. UVA light presents at wavelengths longer than UVB (between 400 and 315 nm); and it can also be absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells, but at lower efficienciesabout 1/100 to 1/1000 of UVB.

Exposure to radiation (UVA and UVB) is a major contributor to developing melanoma. Occasional extreme sun exposure that results in &quot;sunburn&quot; on areas of the human body is causally related to melanoma; and such areas of only intermittent exposure apparently explains why melanoma is more common on the back in men and on the legs in women. The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more common in professional and administrative workers than unskilled workers. Other factors are mutations in (or total loss of) tumor suppressor genes. Using sunbeds with their deeply penetrating UVA rays has been linked to the development of skin cancers, including melanoma.

Possible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of skin pigmentation. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from Europe which have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight to which the skin of the settlers is not adapted, most notably Australia. Exposure during childhood is a more important risk factor than exposure in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia.

Incurring multiple severe sunburns increases the likelihood that future sunburns develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage. UV-high sunlight and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.

===Genetics===
A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, greatly increase melanoma susceptibility. Several genes increase risks. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called &quot;MC1R&quot; that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk. Genetic testing can be used to search for the mutations.

One class of mutations affects the gene &quot;CDKN2A&quot;. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in 50% of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell&#x27;s ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).

Familial melanoma is genetically heterogeneous, and loci for familial melanoma appear on the chromosome arms 1p, 9p and 12q. Multiple genetic events have been related to melanoma&#x27;s pathogenesis (disease development). The multiple tumor suppressor 1 (CDKN2A/MTS1) gene encodes p16INK4a – a low-molecular weight protein inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) – which has been localised to the p21 region of human chromosome 9. FAMMM is typically characterized by having 50 or more combined moles in addition to a family history of melanoma. It is transmitted autosomal dominantly and mostly associated with the &quot;CDKN2A&quot; mutations. People who have CDKN2A mutation associated FAMMM have a 38 fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

Other mutations confer lower risk, but are more common in the population. People with mutations in the &quot;MC1R&quot; gene are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies. &quot;MC1R&quot; mutations are very common, and all red-haired people have a mutated copy. Mutation of the &quot;MDM2&quot; SNP309 gene is associated with increased risks for younger women.

Fair- and red-haired people, persons with multiple atypical nevi or dysplastic nevi and persons born with giant congenital melanocytic nevi are at increased risk.

A family history of melanoma greatly increases a person&#x27;s risk, because mutations in several genes have been found in melanoma-prone families. People with a history of one melanoma are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor.

Fair skin is the result of having less melanin in the skin, which means less protection from UV radiation exists.

==Pathophysiology==
The earliest stage of melanoma starts when melanocytes begin out-of-control growth. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, when the tumor is less than 1 mm thick, and spreads at the level of the basal epidermis. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.

When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction – vertically up into the epidermis and into the papillary dermis – cell behaviour changes dramatically.

The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, in which individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. From this point on, melanoma is capable of spreading. The Breslow&#x27;s depth of the lesion is usually less than , while the Clark level is usually 2.

The vertical growth phase (VGP) following is invasive melanoma. The tumor becomes able to grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or lymph vessels. The tumor thickness is usually more than , and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.

The host elicits an immunological reaction against the tumor during the VGP, which is judged by the presence and activity of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of development. In certain cases, the primary tumor is completely destroyed and only the metastatic tumor is discovered. About 40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to MAP kinase pathway.

A cause common to most cancers is damage to DNA. UVA light mainly causes thymine dimers. UVA also produces reactive oxygen species and these inflict other DNA damage, primarily single-strand breaks, oxidized pyrimidines and the oxidized purine 8-oxoguanine (a mutagenic DNA change) at 1/10, 1/10, and 1/3rd the frequencies of UVA-induced thymine dimers, respectively.

If unrepaired, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photoproducts can lead to mutations by inaccurate translesion synthesis during DNA replication or repair. The most frequent mutations due to inaccurate synthesis past CPDs are cytosine to thymine (C&gt;T) or CC&gt;TT transition mutations. These are commonly referred to as UV fingerprint mutations, as they are the most specific mutation caused by UV, being frequently found in sun-exposed skin, but rarely found in internal organs. Errors in DNA repair of UV photoproducts, or inaccurate synthesis past these photoproducts, can also lead to deletions, insertions, and chromosomal translocations.

The entire genomes of 25 melanomas were sequenced. On average, about 80,000 mutated bases (mostly C&gt;T transitions) and about 100 structural rearrangements were found per melanoma genome. This is much higher than the roughly 70 mutations across generations (parent to child). Among the 25 melanomas, about 6,000 protein-coding genes had missense, nonsense, or splice site mutations. The transcriptomes of over 100 melanomas has also been sequenced and analyzed. Almost 70% of all human protein-coding genes are expressed in melanoma. Most of these genes are also expressed in other normal and cancer tissues, with some 200 genes showing a more specific expression pattern in melanoma compared to other forms of cancer. Examples of melanoma specific genes are tyrosinase, MLANA, and &quot;PMEL&quot;.

UV radiation causes damage to the DNA of cells, typically thymine dimerization, which when unrepaired can create mutations in the cell&#x27;s genes. This strong mutagenic factor makes cutaneous melanoma the tumor type with the highest number of mutations. When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading to the formation of a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells; studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor-2 in cancer progression.

Cancer stem cells may also be involved.

=== Gene mutations ===
Large-scale studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving initiation and development of cutaneous melanoma. The Cancer Genome Atlas study has established four subtypes: &quot;BRAF&quot; mutant, &quot;RAS&quot; mutant, &quot;NF1&quot; mutant, and triple wild-type.

The most frequent mutation occurs in the 600th codon of &quot;BRAF&quot; (50% of cases). &quot;BRAF&quot; is normally involved in cell growth, and this specific mutation renders the protein constitutively active and independent of normal physiological regulation, thus fostering tumor growth. RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS and KRAS) are also recurrently mutated (30% of TCGA cases) and mutations in the 61st or 12th codons trigger oncogenic activity. Loss-of-function mutations often affect tumor suppressor genes such as NF1, TP53 and CDKN2A. Other oncogenic alterations include fusions involving various kinases such as BRAF, RAF1, ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK1., NTRK3 and MET&quot; BRAF, RAS&quot;, and &quot;NF1&quot; mutations and kinase fusions are remarkably mutually exclusive, as they occur in different subsets of patients. Assessment of mutation status can, therefore, improve patient stratification and inform targeted therapy with specific inhibitors.

In some cases (3–7%) mutated versions of &quot;BRAF&quot; and &quot;NRAS&quot; undergo copy-number amplification.

=== Metastasis ===
The research done by Sarna&#x27;s team proved that heavily pigmented melanoma cells have Young&#x27;s modulus about 4.93, when in non-pigmented ones it was only 0.98. In another experiment they found that elasticity of melanoma cells is important for its metastasis and growth: non-pigmented tumors were bigger than pigmented and it was much easier for them to spread. They showed that there are both pigmented and non-pigmented cells in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic.

==Diagnosis==

Looking at or visually inspecting the area in question is the most common method of suspecting a melanoma. Moles that are irregular in color or shape are typically treated as candidates. To detect melanomas (and increase survival rates), it is recommended to learn to recognize them (see &quot;ABCDE&quot; mnemonic), to regularly examine moles for changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to consult a qualified physician when a candidate appears. In-person inspection of suspicious skin lesions is more accurate than visual inspection of images of suspicious skin lesions.

When used by trained specialists, dermoscopy is more helpful to identify malignant lesions than use of the naked eye alone. Reflectance confocal microscopy may have better sensitivity and specificity than dermoscopy in diagnosing cutaneous melanoma but more studies are needed to confirm this result.

However, many melanomas present as lesions smaller than 6 mm in diameter, and all melanomas are malignant when they first appear as a small dot. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6 mm in diameter. Seborrheic keratosis may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to false alarms. Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination or with dermatoscopy.

Some advocate replacing &quot;enlarging&quot; with &quot;evolving&quot;: moles that change and evolve are a concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer &quot;elevation&quot;. Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.

===Ugly duckling===
One method is the &quot;ugly duckling sign&quot;. Correlation of common lesion characteristics is made. Lesions that deviate from the common characteristics are labeled an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, and a further professional exam is required. The &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; sign suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi. A dermatoscope must be used to detect &quot;ugly ducklings&quot;, as many melanomas in these individuals resemble nonmelanomas or are considered to be &quot;wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot;.

These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas that do not present easy-to-observe color changes and variations. Their borders are often indistinct, complicating visual identification without a dermatoscope.

Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; sign, and are hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, dermatofibromas, or lentigines.

===Biopsy===
Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam, or &quot;in vivo&quot; diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because of the possibility of sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.

Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes. The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

===Histopathologic types===
Melanoma is a type of neuroectodermal neoplasm. There are four main types of melanoma:
Other histopathologic types are:

* Mucosal melanoma; When melanoma occurs on mucous membranes.
* Desmoplastic melanoma
* Melanoma with small nevus-like cells
* Melanoma with features of a Spitz nevus
* Uveal melanoma
* Vaginal melanoma
* Polypoid melanoma, a subclass of nodular melanoma.

===In situ or invasive===
A melanoma &quot;in situ&quot; has not invaded beyond the basement membrane, whereas an &quot;invasive melanoma&quot; has spread beyond it.

Some histopathological types of melanoma are inherently invasive, including nodular melanoma and lentigo maligna melanoma, where the &quot;in situ&quot; counterpart to lentigo maligna melanoma is lentigo maligna. Lentigo maligna is sometimes classified as a very early melanoma, and sometimes a precursor to melanoma.

Superficial spreading melanomas and acral lentiginous melanomas can be either &quot;in situ&quot; or invasive, but acral lentiginous melanomas are almost always invasive.

===Staging===
&quot;Further context on cancer staging is available at TNM.&quot;

Metastatic melanomas can be detected by X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, PET and PET/CTs, ultrasound, LDH testing and photoacoustic detection. However, there is lack of evidence in the accuracy of staging of people with melanoma with various imaging methods.

Melanoma stages according to AJCC, 8th edition:
* TX: Primary tumor thickness cannot be assessed (such as a diagnosis by curettage)
* T0: No evidence of primary tumor (such as unknown primary or completely regressed melanoma)
Stage 1 and 2 require an N (lymph node) class of:
:*N0 – No regional metastases.

Stage 1, 2 and 3 require an M (metastasis status) of:
* M0: No evidence of distant metastasis

Older systems include &quot;Clark level&quot; and &quot;Breslow&#x27;s depth&quot;, quantifying microscopic depth of tumor invasion.

===Laboratory===
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tests are often used to screen for metastases, although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates the metastatic spread of the disease to the liver.

It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases CT, MRI, and/or PET scans. Although controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of the lymph nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S-100 protein marker.

HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors. The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.

HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

==Prevention==
There is no evidence to support or refute adult population screening for melanoma.

===Ultraviolet radiation===
Minimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds), following sun protection measures and wearing sun protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, and broad-brimmed hats) can offer protection.

Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.

UV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another common and widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided. Although the risk of developing skin cancer through UV nail lamp use is low, it is still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp.

The body uses UV light to generate vitamin D so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half-hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn. Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.

===Sunscreen===
Sunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma. In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.

Concerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage.

===Medications===
A 2005 review found tentative evidence that statin and fibrate medication may decrease the risk of melanoma. A 2006 review however did not support any benefit.

==Treatment==

Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a skin biopsy. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed. Controversy exists around trial evidence for sentinel lymph node biopsy; with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015. Treatment of advanced melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

===Surgery===

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually . Many surgeons consider the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades. A 2009 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a small difference in survival rates favoring wide excision of primary cutaneous melanomas, but these results were not statistically significant.

Mohs surgery has been reported with cure rate as low as 77% and as high as 98.0% for melanoma-in-situ. CCPDMA and the &quot;double scalpel&quot; peripheral margin controlled surgery is equivalent to Mohs surgery in effectiveness on this &quot;intra-epithelial&quot; type of melanoma.

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the lymph nodes in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically (lymphadenectomy) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.

Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes is a widely used procedure when treating cutaneous melanoma.

Neither sentinel lymph node biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and have a 5-year survival rate of 97%. Because of these considerations, sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling may be used as auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.

If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional skin biopsy is the management of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2 mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue. To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1 mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow&#x27;s thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5 cm, 1.0 cm, or 2 cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

===Add on treatment===
Adjuvant treatment after surgery may reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery, especially in high-risk melanomas. Routines vary in different countries, but today (2024) the most common adjuvant treatment is immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for up to a year post-surgery.

In the early 2000s, a relatively common strategy was to treat patients with high risk of recurrence with up to a year of high-dose interferon treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient&#x27;s prognosis slightly. A 2013 meta-analysis suggested that the addition of interferon alpha increased disease-free and overall survival for people with AJCC TNM stage II-III cutaneous melanoma. A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease quality of life. In the European Union, interferon is usually not used outside the scope of clinical trials.

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy drugs such as dacarbazine have been the backbone of metastatic melanoma treatment since FDA approval in 1975; however, its efficacy in terms of survival has never been proven in an RCT. Since the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors, dacarbazine and its oral counterpart temozolomide constitute potential treatment options in later lines of therapy.

Multiple drugs are available to patients to decrease the size of the tumor. By lessening the size of the tumor, some symptoms can be relieved; however, this does not necessarily lead to remission. Some of these drugs are dacarbazine, temozolomide, and fotemustine. Combinations of drugs are also used and, in some cases, present higher remission rates. These medication combinations can have harmful side effects. To maintain quality of life, patients require assistive treatments and observation. Although combinations of drugs increase remission rates, the survival rate does not show an increase.

In people with locally advanced cutaneous malignancies and sarcoma, isolated limb infusion (ILI) has been found to be a minimally invasive and well-tolerated procedure for delivering regional chemotherapy.

===Targeted therapy===
Melanoma cells have mutations that allow them to survive and grow indefinitely in the body. Small-molecule targeted therapies work by blocking the genes involved in pathways for tumor proliferation and survival. The main treatments are BRAF, C-Kit and NRAS inhibitors. These inhibitors work to inhibit the downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and tumour development due to specific gene mutations. People can be treated with small-molecule targeted inhibitors if they are positive for the specific mutation. BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib and a MEK inhibitor trametinib are the most effective, approved treatments for BRAF positive melanoma. Melanoma tumors can develop resistance during therapy which can make therapy no longer effective, but combining the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors may create a fast and lasting melanoma therapy response.

A number of treatments improve survival over traditional chemotherapy. Biochemotherapy (chemotherapy with cytokines IL-2 and IFN-α) combined with BRAF inhibitors improved survival for people with BRAF positive melanoma. Biochemotherapy alone did not improve overall survival and had higher toxicity than chemotherapy. Combining multiple chemotherapy agents (polychemotherapy) did not improve survival over monochemotherapy. Targeted therapies result in relatively short progression-free survival (PFS) times. The therapy combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has a 3-year PFS of 23%, and 5-year PFS of 13%.

Lifileucel (Amtagvi) is a tumor-derived autologous T cell immunotherapy that was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2024.

===Immunotherapy===
Immunotherapy is aimed at stimulating the person&#x27;s immune system against the tumor, by enhancing the body&#x27;s own ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The current approach to treating melanoma with immunotherapy includes three broad categories of treatments including cytokines, immune check point inhibitors, and adoptive cell transfer. These treatment options are most often used in people with metastatic melanoma and significantly improves overall survival. However, these treatments are often costly. For example, one immune check point inhibitor treatment, pembrolizumab, costs US$10,000 to $12,000 for a single dose administered every 3 weeks.

Cytokine therapies used for melanoma include IFN-a and IL-2. IL-2 (Proleukin) was the first new therapy approved (1990 EU, 1992 US) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 20 years. IL-2 may offer the possibility of a complete and long-lasting remission in this disease in a small percentage of people with melanoma. Intralesional IL-2 for in-transit metastases has a high complete response rate ranging from 40 to 100%. Similarly, IFN-a has shown only modest survival benefits and high toxicity, limiting its use as a stand-alone therapy.

Immune check point inhibitors include anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, CD40 agonists, anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, pidilizumab, and nivolumab) and PD-L1 antibodies. Evidence suggests that anti-PD-1 antibodies are more effective than anti-CTLA4 antibodies with less systemic toxicity. The five-year progression-free survival for immunotherapy with pembrolizumab is 21%. A therapeutic approach that includes the combination of different therapies improves overall survival and progression-free survival compared to treatment with the separate immunotherapy drugs alone.

Ongoing research is looking at treatment by adoptive cell transfer. Adoptive cell transfer refers to the application of pre-stimulated, modified T cells or dendritic cells and is presently used to minimize complications from graft-versus-host disease.

The combination nivolumab/relatlimab (Opdualag) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2022.

===Lentigo maligna===

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard &quot;bread-loafing&quot; technique of fixed tissue histology – result in a high &quot;false negative&quot; error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If bread loafing is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in-situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment.

Mohs surgery has been done with cure rate reported to be as low as 77%, and as high as 95% by another author. The &quot;double scalpel&quot; peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods.

Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ (lentigo maligna) have resolved with an experimental treatment, imiquimod (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some derma-surgeons are combining the two methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months. While some studies have suggested the adjuvant use of topical tazarotene, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend it and suggests that it increases topical inflammation, leading to lower patient compliance.

===Radiation===
Radiation therapy is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with un-resectable distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property of the maximum radiation dose occurring close to the skin surface. It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival. Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.
Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma.

==Prognosis==
Factors that affect prognosis include:
* tumor thickness in millimeters (Breslow&#x27;s depth),
* depth related to skin structures (Clark level),
* type of melanoma,
* presence of ulceration,
* presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion,
* presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (if present, prognosis is better),
* location of lesion,
* presence of satellite lesions, and
* presence of regional or distant metastasis.

Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their thickness. Less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a wide local excision (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.

When melanomas have spread to the lymph nodes, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macro-metastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of melanoma prognosis.

Stage IV melanoma, in which it has metastasized, is the most deadly skin malignancy: five-year survival is 22.5%. When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In some cases, patients may live many months or even years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.

There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g., rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a pathology report might indicate.

About 200 genes are prognostic in melanoma, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is correlated to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times. Examples of unfavorable genes are MCM6 and TIMELESS; an example of a favorable gene is WIPI1.

An increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with worse outcomes.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. It has become more common in the last 20 years in areas that are mostly Caucasian.

The rate of melanoma has increased in the recent years, but it is not clear to what extent changes in behavior, in the environment, or in early detection are involved.

===Australia===
Australia has a very high – and increasing – rate of melanoma. In 2012, deaths from melanoma occurred in 7.3–9.8 per 100,000 population. In Australia, melanoma is the third most common cancer in either sex; indeed, its incidence is higher than for lung cancer, although the latter accounts for more deaths. It is estimated that in 2012, more than 12,000 Australians were diagnosed with melanoma: given Australia&#x27;s modest population, this is better expressed as 59.6 new cases per 100,000 population per year; &gt;1 in 10 of all new cancer cases were melanomas. Melanoma incidence in Australia is matter of significance, for the following reasons:
* Australian melanoma incidence has increased by more than 30 per cent between 1991 and 2009.
* Australian melanoma age-standardized incidence rates were, as of 2008, at least 12 times higher than the world average.
* Australian melanoma incidence is, by some margin, the highest in the world.
* Overall age-standardized cancer incidence in Australia is the highest in the world, and this is attributable to melanoma alone. Age-standardized overall cancer incidence is similar to New Zealand, but there is a statistically significant difference between Australia and all other parts of the developed world including North America, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean.

===United States===
In the United States, about 9,000 people die from melanoma a year. In 2011, it affected 19.7 per 100,000, and resulted in death in 2.7 per 100,000.

In 2013:
* 71,943 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin, including 42,430 men and 29,513 women.
* 9,394 people in the United States died from melanomas of the skin, including 6,239 men and 3,155 women.
The American Cancer Society&#x27;s estimates for melanoma incidence in the United States for 2017 are:
* About 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women).
* About 9,730 people are expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women).
Melanoma is more than 20 times more common in whites than in African Americans. Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 2.5% (1 in 40) for whites, 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for African Americans, and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Mexicans.

The risk of melanoma increases as people age. The average age of people when the disease is diagnosed is 63.

==History==

Although melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine Peruvian mummies, radiocarbon dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.

John Hunter is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a &quot;cancerous fungous excrescence&quot;. The excised tumor was preserved in the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma.

The French physician René Laennec was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806.

The first English-language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820. In his later work in 1857 he remarked that there is a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (&quot;Eight Cases of Melanosis with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease&quot;). Norris was also a pioneer in suggesting a link between nevi and melanoma and the possibility of a relationship between melanoma and environmental exposures, by observing that most of his patients had pale complexions. He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.

The first formal acknowledgment of advanced melanoma as untreatable came from Samuel Cooper in 1840. He stated that the only chance for a cure depends upon the early removal of the disease (i.e., early excision of the malignant mole) ...&#x27;

More than one and a half centuries later this situation remains largely unchanged.

===Terminology===
The word &quot;melanoma&quot; came to English from 19th-century Neo-Latin and uses combining forms derived from ancient Greek roots: &quot;&quot; (denoting melanin) + &quot;&quot; (denoting a tissue mass and especially a neoplasm), in turn from Greek &quot;melas&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, and &quot;oma&quot;, &quot;process&quot;. The word &quot;melanoma&quot; has a long history of being used in a broader sense to refer to any melanocytic tumor, typically, but not always malignant, but today the narrower sense referring only to malignant types has become so dominant that benign tumors are usually not called melanomas anymore and the word &quot;melanoma&quot; is now usually taken to mean malignant melanoma unless otherwise specified. Terms such as &quot;benign melanocytic tumor&quot; unequivocally label the benign types, and modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.

==Research==
Pharmacotherapy research for un-resectable or metastatic melanoma is ongoing.

===Targeted therapies===

In clinical research, adoptive cell therapy and gene therapy, are being tested.

Two kinds of experimental treatments developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), have been used in metastatic melanoma with tentative success.

The first treatment involves adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using TILs immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated from a person&#x27;s own melanoma tumor. These cells are grown in large numbers in a laboratory and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient&#x27;s body. TIL therapy following lymphodepletion can result in durable complete response in a variety of setups.

The second treatment, adoptive transfer of genetically altered autologous lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that encode so called T cell receptors (TCRs), into patient&#x27;s lymphocytes. After that manipulation lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules found on the surface of melanoma cells and kill them.

A cancer vaccine showed modest benefit in late-stage testing in 2009 against melanoma.

===BRAF inhibitors===
About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the B-Raf gene. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon&#x27;s vemurafenib could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation. In June 2011, a large clinical trial confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.

In August 2011, Vemurafenib received FDA approval for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. In May 2013 the US FDA approved dabrafenib as a single agent treatment for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced melanoma.

Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor trametinib led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median progression-free survival increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months. Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.

In January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of people with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. In June 2018, the FDA approved the combination of a BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and a MEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of un-resectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.

Eventual resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be due to a cell surface protein known as EphA2 which is now being investigated.

===Ipilimumab===
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference in June 2010, the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment. The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.

Ipilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.

In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful of improving the five year survival rate, though serious adverse side-effects were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug&#x27;s brandname is Yervoy.

===Surveillance methods===
Advances in high resolution ultrasound scanning have enabled surveillance of metastatic burden to the sentinel lymph nodes. The Screening and Surveillance of Ultrasound in Melanoma trial (SUNMEL) is evaluating ultrasound as an alternative to invasive surgical methods.

===Oncolytic virotherapy===
In some countries oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising branch of virotherapy, where oncolytic viruses are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity and disorganize vasculature. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus type 1–derived oncolytic immunotherapy), was shown to be useful against metastatic melanoma in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months.

===Antivirals===
Antiretrovirals have been tested in vitro against melanoma. The rationale behind this lies in their potential to inhibit human endogenous retroviruses, whose activity has been associated with the development of melanoma. 
Evidence from studies on melanoma cell lines indicates that antiretroviral drugs, including lamivudine, doravirine, and cabotegravir, can effectively downregulate the expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV-K). These drugs not only reduce cell growth and invasiveness but also enhance the potential of immune checkpoint therapies. Furthermore, they have shown promise in addressing resistance mechanisms that emerge following prolonged treatment with BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib and AZ628. By restoring apoptosis, decreasing cell viability, and influencing tumor suppressor proteins, these antiretrovirals offer a compelling strategy to tackle therapeutic resistance in melanoma. Further developments are awaited through animal model testing.

<doc id="716637" wikidata="Q1638520" url="?curid=716637" title="Geo-Force">
<text>Geo-Force (Brion Markov) is a fictional superhero character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Markov is the younger Prince Twin of Markovia and the elder brother of Terra. One of the founding members of the superhero group the Outsiders, he was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo, and first appeared in a special insert in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #200 (July 1983).

The character has made limited appearances throughout animated and live-action media. He is voiced by Troy Baker in &quot;Young Justice&quot; and portrayed by Jahking Guillory in &quot;Black Lightning&quot;.

==Creation==
Mike W Barr spoke on the characters creation stating,

&quot;Len Wein and I worked out what the new characters would be and sent descriptions to Jim, saying &quot;Draw these up and see what you think.&quot; Jim submitted his visual ideas for those characters, with the exception of Geo-Force, who turned out to be the brother of Terra from The New Teen Titans. I&#x27;m pretty sure George Perez designed that costume, because it was based on Terra&#x27;s costume ... We decided even before the book was printed that that would be the connection between the two characters. I had not known about the character. She was still in the planning stages when I came up with the idea for Geo-Force, and Len said &quot;Well, we have this other character with Earth powers in New Teen Titans, what are we going to do about that?&quot; Marv Wolfman was brought in on the discussion of that, and it was Marv&#x27;s idea that they&#x27;d be half-brother and sister.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Batman and the Outsiders===
Brion Markov is the prince of Markovia and the half-brother of Terra. Helga Jace gives them both earth-manipulating superpowers to stop an insurrection mounted by Baron Bedlam. During this time, Brion meets Batman, Metamorpho, Black Lightning, Katana, and Halo, with which he forms the Outsiders.

Following Terra&#x27;s death during &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; storyline, Geo-Force assumes a new green and gold costume to distance himself from her.

===The Outsiders===
After the Outsiders split with Batman, they are privately funded by Markovia. During this time, Geo-Force is the unofficial new leader of the team. This information eventually comes out and Major Disaster destroys their base.

Around this time, Markovia again comes under threat by Psycho-Pirate, who disguises himself as Baron Bedlam in an attempt to conquer it. The Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. ally to stop him.

Brion, meanwhile, has a one-night stand with Looker when the team is stranded on a desert island. The move strains the relationship between Brion and his girlfriend Denise Howard, as well as Looker&#x27;s relationship with her husband. Brion and Looker agree to remain platonic friends afterward.

In &quot;Millennium&quot;, the Outsiders disband after Helga Jace is revealed to be an ally of the Manhunters and is killed after attempting to attack Metamorpho. Additionally, Looker loses her powers and Halo is injured and rendered comatose.

In the early 1990s, the Outsiders were revived with former Outsiders Geo-Force, Katana, Halo, and Looker joined by new heroes Faust, Technocrat and Wylde. Geo-Force is framed for the murder of Markovian queen Iona and forced to go on the run.
During this time, another Terra has appeared as part of the Team Titans, who appear to have come from the future. This new Terra claims to have been a normal girl who was given Terra&#x27;s appearance and powers via a DNA virus. Geo-Force&#x27;s first attempt to talk to her meets with failure when he accidentally gets swept up in a rock column she has created during a loud party. He finds her again at the Titans headquarters. After a brief fight with her friends, he manages to sit down with her. The new Terra convinces him she is not his sister. The rogue Markovian scientists attack with the intention of forcibly duplicating Terra&#x27;s powers. Geo-Force and the other Titans rescue her. Further revelations imply that this Terra is in fact from their time, when the original Terra&#x27;s grave is dug up and her corpse is missing from her coffin.

Brion invites Terra to live in Markovia, which she accepts, as her group of Titans is disbanding. In Markovia, scientists conduct a DNA test in the hopes of discovering if Terra is Geo-Force&#x27;s sister. Terra is afraid of finding out the results, fearful that she may be a villainous traitor. When the test results come back positive, Brion lies to Terra, telling her that the results are negative.

Around this time, as part of the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; incident, a portal to Hell threatens to destroy Markovia. A small team of Outsiders, including the newer Terra, Katana, and Halo, are on hand to help combat it.

Geo-Force and Terra become kidnap victims of a strange cult run by a man with mind-control powers. They are rescued by the super-team called the &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;.

Geo-Force briefly appears in &quot;52&quot; #35, assisting Metropolis citizens injured in a mass-murder caused by Lex Luthor. He later is a part of the army of heroes gathered by the Justice Society at the end of &quot;52&quot; to battle Black Adam, who kills Terra.

===Justice League of America===
While sailing in his yacht off the coast of Greece, Geo-Force suddenly finds himself losing control over his powers. This sudden increase in power, which causes Geo-Force to black out, is ultimately caused by the villainous Deathstroke through as yet unrevealed means.

Geo-Force seeks help from the newly reformed Justice League of America, becoming an unofficial member of the group. This will ultimately be revealed to be Deathstroke&#x27;s overall plan, as he confronts Geo-Force to blackmail him into becoming a spy in exchange for Deathstroke&#x27;s promise to remove the added powers he forced upon Geo-Force. Geo-Force informs Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman of Deathstroke&#x27;s scheme and agrees to become a double agent: spying on Deathstroke for the League, while spying on the League for Deathstroke.

The scheme falls apart when Lex Luthor organizes a new incarnation of the Injustice League and captures the Justice League. While a prisoner, Geo-Force is brutally tortured alongside Red Tornado at the hands of Gorilla Grodd. While recovering from his injuries, Geo-Force is &quot;traded&quot; to Batman&#x27;s latest incarnation of The Outsiders, much to Geo-Force&#x27;s dismay and, ultimately, acceptance.

In &quot;DC Universe: Last Will and Testament&quot;, Geo-Force confronts Deathstroke in a battle. After contemplating murder, he is talked out of it by Black Lightning and Rocky Davis of the Challengers of the Unknown. He loses a lot of blood to Deathstroke in their fight, but then he sets their confrontation at the same alley and building complex where Deathstroke&#x27;s second son Jericho was held after being kidnapped. Slashing his own throat in the same manner as his son was cut lets Deathstroke&#x27;s guard down, allowing Brion to impale Deathstroke with his own sword through his own body. Believing he has defeated Deathstroke, while sacrificing his own life, he is surprised to wake up in the hospital. It is thought that he single-handedly took down Deathstroke, but no one knows that Geo-Force was trying to commit suicide. Geo-Force becomes the field leader of the Outsiders and is still secretly living with the shame of his actions.

===Blackest Night===

Geo-Force is visited by his sister, who has been reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. Claiming to have been freed from the dark force that was controlling her, Tara begs Brion to kill her. However, this turned out to be a facade to feed on the Outsiders&#x27; emotions. Geo-Force turns Terra into a statue and her ring is destroyed by Halo.

===Marriage and divorce===
Geo-Force later marries his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard. Since she is not a Markovian, the marriage is annulled by Brion&#x27;s choice. Unbeknownst to Brion, Denise later tries to undergo the same experiment which transformed Geo-Force into a powerful hero but, because she does not have Markovian blood, she gains the same powers but with a changed appearance and loss of sanity, becoming Geode. She is locked up, but escapes to take revenge on Markovia by killing several innocent Markovians. Geo-Force proclaims his affections for Katana, but before she can answer Geo&#x27;s declaration of love, they are interrupted by Eradicator. Eradicator informs Brion of Geode&#x27;s escape and her recent attack on Markovia.

Geo-Force and Eradicator go to intercept Geode. The battle with Brion&#x27;s deranged wife seems one-sided as Geode smacks both heroes around like ragdolls. Eradicator pleads with Geo-Force to use his powers to subdue Geode, but Brion is conflicted over the idea of striking his wife. With Geo-Force unable to take the initiative, Eradicator decides to unleash the full extent of his power to knock Geode unconscious.

Later, Geode is free from her captivity, thanks to an unusual character named Veritas. Veritas wants Geode to begin Markovia&#x27;s immediate destruction, which will draw out Geo-Force, who pinpoints the center of the disturbance in Markovia and is approached by Veritas. Veritas asks Brion to join him and reestablish Markovia&#x27;s Old World Order. Brion refuses Veritas&#x27; offer and Veritas tells Geode to kill her estranged husband. Geo-Force gathers his strength and becomes a giant rock creature.

On his unfortune, Brion&#x27;s unstable powers have put Markovia in danger, because his new form consists of Markovia itself and earthquakes begin to spring up. One earthquake opens up a large crevice beneath Geode and Veritas. The two villains fall to their supposed doom and Geo-Force finally realizes that Veritas used Geode to tempt Geo-Force into unleashing his untapped abilities to destroy Markovia. Now, Markovia is torn between civil war and the devastation that Brion has inadvertently wrought on his people.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; restores DC&#x27;s continuity to a form much as it was before &quot;The New 52&quot;. After the moon is shattered in Vandal Savage&#x27;s battle with the Justice League, Geo-Force holds it together until the heroes can repair it.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Geo-Force is the leader of the Outsiders, and is identified as one of several superheroes given their powers by the government. 

In &quot;Shadow War&quot;, he disguises himself as Deathstroke and murders Ra&#x27;s al Ghul to pit the real Deathstroke against Ra&#x27;s&#x27; daughter, Talia al Ghul, against each other and get revenge on both Deathstroke for what he did to Terra, and Talia for hurting his country.

==Powers and abilities==
As implied by his code name, all of Brion&#x27;s powers are in some way related to the planet Earth. He possesses superhuman physical abilities and can manipulate the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field to increase or lower the weight of objects, generate lava blasts, fly at high speeds, and transform matter to stone. Due to his connection to the earth, Geo-Force does not require food, sleep, or air to survive.

Geo-Force is at his strongest when he is firmly planted on the ground. His powers and health will deteriorate if he is out of contact with the earth for long periods of time.

==Other versions==
An alternate timeline variant of Brion Markov appears in &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. This version is the king of Markovia who is later captured by Aquaman, who harnesses his abilities to destroy western Europe.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Two characters based on Brion Markov / Geo-Force appear in media set in the Arrowverse:
** Dr. Brion Markov appears in the &quot;Arrow&quot; episode &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;, portrayed by Eric Floyd. This version is a human Unidac Industries scientist who created a device that can manipulate seismic activity. Malcolm Merlyn hires him to weaponize the device before murdering Markov and his staff so Merlyn can use the device on a crime-infested Starling City district called the Glades as part of his &quot;Undertaking&quot;.
** An Americanized adaptation of Geo-Force appears in &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, portrayed by Jahking Guillory. This version is Brandon Marshall, a student at Garfield High alongside Jennifer Pierce. Early in the third season, he reveals his metahuman status to her and how Helga Jace killed his mother, Helen, in her experiments before occasionally working with Pierce to repel a Markovian invasion. Near the end of the season, he learns Helen was a Markovian and his father had the same geokinetic abilities as him. In response, Marshall keeps Jace in his apartment to gain information about him.
* Brion Markov / Geo-Force appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Troy Baker. This version is the 17-year-old, fraternal, younger twin brother of Crown Prince Gregor Markov of Markovia. After his younger sister Tara is kidnapped by metahuman traffickers, Brion decides to activate his meta-gene so he can stop the traffickers and find her, only to be placed into a meta-activation tank against his will by Helga Jace and Simon Ecks. When his uncle Baron Bedlam tries to frame him for the murder of his parents, Brion confronts him, but lacks control of his powers. After Superboy defeats Bedlam, Gregor is forced to exile Brion from Markovia, but asks Superboy to take care of his brother in his place. Following this, Brion begins training with Superboy, Nightwing, Artemis, Halo, Black Lightning, and Forager to better control his abilities. He also enters a relationship with Halo and develops a friendship with Forager. Brion eventually reunites with Tara, though he and his allies are initially unaware of her alliance with the Light. Following this, Brion joins the Team, and later the Outsiders. While on a mission to Markovia to stop Bedlam once more, Brion learns of Tara&#x27;s deceit. Though she defects to the Team&#x27;s side, Zviad Baazovi secretly manipulates Brion into killing Bedlam and usurping Gregor as king of Markovia on the Light&#x27;s behalf. In the fourth season, Brion becomes the leader of the Infinitors.

<doc id="716640" wikidata="Q4782683" url="?curid=716640" title="Aqualad">
<text>Aqualad is the alias of several superheroes in American comic books published by DC Comics and appearing in media published by DC Entertainment. The character was originally created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist Ramona Fradon, serving as the sidekick and junior counterpart to superhero Aquaman alongside contemporary, Aquagirl. The character&#x27;s first incarnation, [[Garth (comics)|Garth]], debuted in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #269. A native Atlantean unlike his mentor, Garth in both continuities has purple eyes signifying a heritage considered evil and was an outcast taken in by Aquaman. He eventually abandons the &quot;Aqualad&quot; role and adopts the alias, &quot;Tempest&quot;.

The second incarnation of the character, [[Kaldur&#x27;ahm]], originally was set to debut in 2010, created for the &quot;Young Justice&quot; animated television series by Brandon Vietti, Greg Weisman, and Phil Bourassa. Several months before the series&#x27; premiere, an altered version of the character, Jackson Hyde, was brought into comic books by writer Geoff Johns and artist Ivan Reis. Both versions of the character, sharing the common quality of Aquaman&#x27;s half-human heritage, are protege of Aquaman whose half human heritage originates from their father, Aquaman villain Black Manta. While sharing similar designs, both versions of the character possess different backgrounds and inherent abilities.

The Garth version of Aqualad made his live-action debut in the television series &quot;Titans&quot;, played by Drew Van Acker.

==Fictional character biography==

===Garth===

Years ago, King Thar and his wife Queen Berra became the reigning monarchs of Shayeris, the capital of a group of Idyllist colonies in the Hidden Valley. Radical Idyllists deposed and murdered King Thar and banished his pregnant wife Queen Berra to Poseidonis, the capital city of Atlantis; there she gave birth to Garth, a child with purple eyes. Superstitious Atlanteans claimed that Garth had been born genetically inferior due to his purple eyes and banished him to a barren seabed leagues away from Atlantis. He survived and later befriended Aquaman, the sometimes outcast King of Atlantis. He was a founding member of the Teen Titans, and later became known as Tempest.

===Jackson Hyde===
Jackson Hyde first appeared in &quot;Brightest Day&quot; #10 (September 2010). This coincides with the appearance of Aqualad in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; animated series (albeit using the name Kaldur&#x27;ahm). According to Johns, the new Aqualad is named Jackson Hyde, and is a black teenager from New Mexico. In a teaser poster for the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; event, he is shown using &quot;hard water&quot; abilities to create a sword. This ability had previously been thought to belong exclusively to Aquaman&#x27;s wife, Mera, and people from her world.

<doc id="716650" wikidata="Q6889752" url="?curid=716650" title="Modulate (album)">
<text>Modulate is Bob Mould&#x27;s fifth solo album, released in 2002. Although a few tracks on his previous release, &quot;The Last Dog and Pony Show&quot;, had featured tape loops and samples, Mould shocked his fans with such a dramatic embrace of electronica.

Mould dubbed the tour supporting this album &quot;The Carnival of Light and Sound&quot;. It featured him performing alone on stage, backed by prerecorded tracks as short films were projected on screens behind him.

==Background and production==
Bob Mould issued his fourth studio album &quot;The Last Dog and Pony Show&quot; in 1998, marking his final release for the record label Rykodisc. During tours in promotion for it, Mould billed it as a demise to the &quot;punk-rocky guitar guy standing at stage left, jumping around and yelling&quot;, having spent the previous two decades playing alternative rock and hardcore punk with his prior bands Hüsker Dü and Sugar. By the end of the year, he had become tired of working with a full band in a live environment. This aspect, combined with Mould consuming club music from living in New York City, particularly in Chelsea, Manhattan, marked the beginning of his next album. Writing for it initially began in early 1999, until he spent sometime away from music, focusing on his personal life, including losing weight. 

Mould worked as a consultant for the World Championship Wrestling company between late 1999 and early 2000. For some months following this position, he discovered electronic acts such as John Digweed, Paul Van Dyk, Richard Morel, Swayzak and Nick Warren, in addition to &quot;Version 2.0&quot; (1998) by Garbage. He came to the conclusion that it was not dissimilar from the music he was previously making with guitars, highlighting the building of chords and adding grooves to single notes. One electronic release in particular, &quot;Xpander&quot; (1999) by Sasha, served as an inspiration; he subsequently purchased new electronic equipment for his studio. He re-learned the songwriting process, solely with samplers, synthesizers and digital recorders. He sampled seven-inch singles of other artists work, but abandoned this method after a couple months when it dawned on him that he was attempting it like a DJ would, and would have to pay to release material like that. He started to sample guitar parts and grooves he made on his own and alter them, eventually making loops and drum sequences. Mould remarked that it was easier crafting this material than making his debut studio album &quot;Workbook&quot; (1989), where he had to &quot;sit down and relearn the guitar&quot;, whereas for the new songs, he &quot;pick[ed] up a different set of tools, trying to supplement my songwriting and storytelling style&quot;. Mould produced &quot;Modulate&quot; at Granary 6 in New York City and Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York, with Damien Shannon serving as engineer at the latter. Mould then mixed the recordings at Granary 6 and The Hit Factory, also located in New York City.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Overview===
&quot;Modulate&quot; is an electronic and power pop album, which evoked the sound of New Order; it takes its name from a lyric in &quot;Comeonstrong&quot;. Chris Larry of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; compared it to the work of Erasure with the 1980s-esque keyboards, &quot;elements of house music and an overall, industrialized sci-fi sound&quot;. Mould said he was against disco and electronic music when those styles emerged at the end of the 1970s, only for him to change his mind: &quot;Now, 25 years later, I&#x27;m looking at it, going, &#x27;This is really interesting. &quot;City Pages&quot; reviewer Peter S. Scholtes said it &quot;mirrors the strengths and weaknesses&quot; of &quot;Good News for Modern Man&quot; (1999) by former Hüsker Dü bandmate Grant Hart. &quot;God Is in the TV&quot; writer Humphrey Fordham suggested that the drum and bass and trip hop track &quot;Megamanic&quot; from &quot;The Last Dog and Pony Show&quot; laid the groundwork for &quot;Modulate&quot;, comparing the album to other releases that saw legacy acts &quot;going out on a limb&quot;, such as &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot; (1977) by Joni Mitchell and &quot;Trans&quot; (1983) by Neil Young. Jon Wurster of &quot;Indy Week&quot; pointed out Mould&#x27;s 1996 self-titled album for its employment of drum machines, in addition to highlighting &quot;Megamanic&quot; for it being Mould&#x27;s initial foray into electronic music.

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that the tracks were presented differently from Mould&#x27;s other works: &quot;they&#x27;re insular, one-man creations (even more so than Workbook), as that man tries to expand his art by grappling with new technologies and trends and a whole bunch of electronic instruments and computers&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; contributor Gary Glauber mentioned that Mould&#x27;s &quot;pop sensibility remains—only it’s a palette of vocoder, distortion, loops, samples, and other noise tricks from which he paints his sound pictures now&quot;, adding that it &quot;does not totally abandon the past; occasional strains of that familiar Mould guitar sound are evident&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; writer Dan Oko remarked that it delivered an electronic sound with &quot;synthetic vocals that owe more to Daft Punk and Madonna than his SST heyday&quot;. Glauber noted that the tracks that feature the &quot;electronic effects seem curiously concentrated&quot; on the album&#x27;s first half; after this, Mould&#x27;s previous guitar sound returns with &quot;Slay / Sway&quot; and &quot;The Receipt&quot;, recalling the material by Sugar. Mould said he wanted to make an artistic statement by putting the electronic-focused songs on the first half.

===Tracks===
&quot;180 Rain&quot;, which beings with car alarm and siren sounds, uses a vocoder effect in a similar vein to that of Cher and Daft Punk. Glauber thought the added sounds &quot;enhance the lyrical idea of &#x27;a catastrophe is happening tonight&#x27;, like rain that can’t be stopped, another unhappy relationship&quot;. For the Philip Glass-tinged &quot;Sunset Safety Glass&quot;, Glauber said it &quot;trades on repetition to drive home its musical point, while oddly juxtaposed lyrical images seek to disturb&quot; the listener. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Pat Blashill wrote that &quot;Semper Fi&quot; has a baroque structure consisting of &quot;wheezing, calliope-style synth effects and squiggles, with Mould&#x27;s drawling, side-of-the-mouth vocals and guitars roaring away underneath everything&quot;. The song talks about a private love affair in the military, and is followed by the instrumental &quot;Homecoming Parade&quot;, which features two minutes of bagpipes and other samples. In &quot;Lost Zoloft&quot;, Mould&#x27;s stream of consciousness lyrics, which discuss self-doubt, is anchored around keyboard percussion. The staff at &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; prosed that it dealt with the &quot;underreported phenomenon of same-sex spousal abuse&quot;, while one of the lyrics could be interpretated as being &quot;about any abusive relationship, until he mentions &#x27;a latent homosex becomes so violent when provoked. Preceded by the musique concrète track &quot;Without?&quot;, Oko said with the guitar-centric &quot;Slay / Sway&quot;, Mould shows that he &quot;may yet find a way to align his Midwestern godfather-of-grunge past and NYC club-hopping present&quot;.

&quot;The Receipt&quot; recalled the direction of &quot;The Last Dog and Pony Show&quot; with its guitar sound, sans electronic coda. Sam Lambeth of &quot;Louder Than War&quot; theorised if it was about Mould&#x27;s strained relationship with Hart. According to Glauber, &quot;Quasar&quot; sees Mould use &quot;synthesizers, samplers, and digital toys in another interesting layered clatter that’s tuneful and catchy, but suffers from its halfway treatment&quot;. &quot;Soundonsound&quot; talks about a couple staying together despite growing apart from one another. &quot;Hornery&quot; is a short, minute-long instrumental song consisting of guitar feedback, akin to &quot;Arc-Weld&quot; (1991) by Young. &quot;Comeonstrong&quot; is an alternative rock track, which blends Mould&#x27;s guitar sound and the electronic edge of the other songs on the album. During it, he describes the struggle of finding balance in life. &quot;Trade&quot; recalled the works of New Order and Pet Shop Boys, while its lyrics, as Jonathan Cohen of Nude as the News writes, sees Mould &quot;wrestles with the most basic of requests: he won’t give &#x27;the answer&#x27; until he can pre-determine what the implied tradeoff is&quot;. The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Author&#x27;s Lament&quot;, mixes digital percussion and an electric piano, initially beginning as a sparse arrangement that eventually builds into noisy feedback. It tries to merge the sound of Aphex Twin and Joe Jackson.

==Release==
In the February 9, 2002 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Modulate&quot; was announced for release the following month, and was expected to be followed by two more albums from Mould that same year. It was issued on March 12, 2002 through the label Granary Music, which Mould founded. A year prior, he had nearly signed to another label, before deciding to start his own. It stemmed from an instance where HBO wanted to license one of his past songs, &quot;Sunspots&quot; from &quot;Workbook&quot;, from his previous label Virgin Records, but were unable to due to the high cost Virgin wanted. Mould looked for other avenues of distribution, until his publicist Carla Sacks suggest contacting Michael Hausman from United Musicians, who were located two blocks from Mould&#x27;s residence. Design company Gay Power Elite did the artwork for the album, while Lisa Pearl contributed a picture of Mould. In the UK, the album was issued through Cooking Vinyl, who included videos for &quot;Slay / Sway&quot;, &quot;Comeonstrong&quot; and &quot;Sunset Safety Glass&quot; on it. Two months into its release, Mould said he was &quot;already six figures &quot;, and that the album had leaked earlier than its release.

Mould subsequently enlisted radio pluggers from college and triple-A stations to help promote &quot;Modulate&quot;. He planned to embarked on the Carnival of Light and Sound tour, which was held in small theatres across the US, which would see him split the set between the new album and his back catalogue. With Mould in charge of the production, 32 videos were made to accompany the shows, utilizing a rear-projection setup. For the older songs, he was expected to play different renditions of them, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how people are going to take to the drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass version of Hüsker Dü&quot; material. &quot;Soundonsound&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s sole single in 2002, with &quot;Slay / Sway&quot; and &quot;Sunset Safety Glass&quot; as its B-sides. The music video for &quot;SoundonSound&quot;, which was directed by Scott Stuckey, features footage of Mould playing a guitar, interspersed with animation of a couple interacting with various animals.

&quot;Modulate&quot; was reissued on CD as part of the career-spanning box set &quot;Distortion: 1989 – 2019&quot; (2020), and on vinyl as part of the smaller &quot;Distortion: 1996 – 2007&quot; (2021) box set. Alongside this, &quot;180 Rain&quot; was included on the compilation album &quot;Distortion: The Best of 1989 – 2019&quot; (2021).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Modulate&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 61, based on 11 reviews. Mould said he saw mixed reviews, ranging from &#x27;What the hell is this?&#x27; to &#x27;This is great! He mentioned that his lifelong follows were divided: &quot;the ones who think it&#x27;s blasphemous and the ones who, on second listen, realize it&#x27;s me. Then there&#x27;s a group who isn&#x27;t familiar with the history--and then they hear the record and they love it&quot;.
Several reviewers commented on the change in Mould&#x27;s sound. Erlewine said that at points, Mould seems &quot;more interested in what these new [electronic] tools can do than using them to complete his songs, which illustrates just how determined he is to find a new way to make music&quot;. Oko felt that it &quot;relies on computer-generated synthesizer riffs and comes across as a half-assed experiment&quot; as a result. Wolk saw it as a &quot;transitional album: Mould sprinting away from his past&quot;. Blashill said &quot;Ultimately, this is a rock record with electronic effects, not a techno record with guitars, and it falls short of being totally satisfying as either. But &quot;Modulate&quot; isn&#x27;t a failure so much as a first step&quot;. Steve Kandell of &quot;Spin&quot; said it &quot;reflected his newfound fascination with dance music, striking a balance between post-punk gravitas and electronic bacchanalia&quot; which would surprise older fans of his work. Larry said that with &quot;playing and tweaking all the noisemakers, he gives even the most programmed moments a homespun feel&quot;. Glauber said &quot;not all of these noise-pop songs achieve the right degree of unity and balance between old and new. Some get lost in a limbo of electronic cacophony, with too many elements not coming together to match Mould’s pop-songwriting skill&quot;. Michelle Kleinsak of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; said Mould &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem entirely comfortable with or committed to this world of loops and samples&quot;.
Few remarks were made on the album&#x27;s lyrics. Oko said &quot;longtime fans will be disappointed to find few signs of the distorted guitar sounds and strangled, angst-ridden lyrics&quot; that were staples of Husker Du and Sugar. Douglas Wolk of &quot;Blender&quot;wrote that the lyrics were nearly &quot;buried in the mix, although the discernible ones are almost suffocatingly bitter&quot;. Glauber thought that it delivered &quot;simple chordal structures, direct lyrical content and manages to mirror the density of Mould’s sonic layering in media other than guitar&quot;.
Critics were mixed on the overall quality of the album. Erlewine remarked that it was the &quot;sound of growing pains. Since Mould is an accomplished songwriter, there are some good songs here (although there are many more that miss the mark), but the defining characteristic of this album is not the songs, but the approach to the songs -- the way he layers on sequencers and vocoders as if each subsequent overdub brought him further into new sonic territory, even when his writing hasn&#x27;t changed that much&quot;. Oko said that it would shock listeners &quot;and that&#x27;s not necessarily a compliment&quot;; Cohen expanded on this, saying that while the album starts to &quot;make more sense after (many) repeat listens, the overall results are at best uneven, and at worst, absolutely baffling&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27; Ethan Smith wrote that it was a &quot;forgettable CD larded with limp electronic experimentation. Mould’s in safer territory on the handful of straightforward guitar rock that remains his strength&quot;. Christie Leo of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; similar stated that &quot;its blend of insinuating hooks and automatic-brew throb sounds corny&quot;. Blashill considered it to be &quot;more akin to the work of a devoted Beatles fan exploring a new studio full of electronic equipment&quot;.

Fordham noted that Mould would go fully electronic with &quot;Long Playing Grooves&quot; (2002), under the moniker Loudbomb. He also mentioned that &quot;Quasar&quot; acted as a sort of &quot;blueprint for Radiohead’s &quot;In Rainbows&quot; five years in advance&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot; Michael Nelson ranked &quot;Modulate&quot; as Mould&#x27;s worst release, as of 2012, as he &quot;frequently sounds out of his comfort zone and unsure of himself&quot;. Kyle Ryan of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; cautioned listeners that &quot;Modulate&quot; was &quot;only for advanced studies&quot; of Mould&#x27;s work, adding that it is &quot;worth hearing as a stylistic experiment, and it has good moments, but new fans would be better off digging through the rest of his work first&quot;.

<text>Dominic Dale (born 29 December 1971) is a Welsh professional snooker player, as well as snooker commentator and presenter for the BBC and Eurosport.

==Career==
Dale was born in Coventry, England. He won the Welsh Amateur Championship, which allowed him to compete at the World Amateur Championship in Bangkok. Dale reached the final, but lost 9–11 against Noppadon Noppachorn. Dale turned professional for the 1992–93 season.

He has won two ranking tournaments in his career, the first of which – the Grand Prix in 1997 – he won while ranked number 54 in the world, beating then world number 2 John Higgins 9–6 in the final. It took him a decade to repeat the achievement at the 2007 Shanghai Masters, where he defeated compatriot Ryan Day 10–6 in the final, from 2–6 behind. On his way to the Shanghai final he beat Rory McLeod, Ken Doherty, Adrian Gunnell, Dave Harold and Mark Selby.

Both of his ranking victories were in the season-opening tournaments; he also reached the semi-finals of the season-opening events in 2002 (LG Cup) and 2006 (Northern Ireland Trophy). He also beat Peter Ebdon at the 2008 Malta Cup, despite a bout of stomach cramps and a drinking session the night before the match.

Dale is the only player to have won multiple ranking tournaments without ever reaching the top 16, but he was 14th on the one-year list for both 1997/1998 and 1999/2000 (missing out due to an unsuccessful 1998/1999 season).

His best World Championship performances were in 2000 and 2014, when he reached the quarter-finals.

Dale won the third professional tournament of his career when he won Event 6 of the Players Tour Championship 2010/2011, beating Martin Gould 4–3 in the final. This win, along with other consistent performances, were enough to see him back into the top 32 players. He also qualified for the World Championship for the first time since 2004, although he was comprehensively beaten 10–2 in the first round by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

===2011/2012 season===

Dale had a good start to his 2011–12 season as he reached the quarter-finals of the first event, the Australian Goldfields Open. Dale was originally due to meet Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round, but due to his withdrawal for medical reasons he instead played amateur Steve Mifsud and won 5–2. He then beat home favourite Neil Robertson on the final black in a 5–4 win lasting almost four hours, before losing to Mark Williams in another final-frame decider, having never been behind in the match until the end.
He then reached the final stages of the UK Championship for the first time since 2005 by beating Nigel Bond in the final qualifying round and was drawn against Judd Trump in the last 32. Dale led 4–2 before Trump had a large slice of fortune in the seventh frame by a pink. Dale would eventually lose the match 4–6. He also reached the 2012 PTC Finals courtesy of finishing twentieth in the Order of Merit. His qualification was largely due to making the final of Event 10, where he was beaten by Michael Holt 2–4. In the Finals he lost 2–4 to Xiao Guodong in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Dale qualified for the World Championship with a 10–3 victory over Ben Woollaston to set up another first round meeting with Judd Trump. He led the match 7–6 against an opponent who later revealed to be suffering from food poisoning, before conceding four successive frames to lose 7–10. Dale finished the season ranked world number 23, meaning he had climbed 8 places during the year.

===2012/2013 season===

Dale qualified for nine of the eleven ranking events during the 2012–13 season, but lost in the first round in eight of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exception was at the International Championship where he beat Graeme Dott 6–3, before losing 5–6 to 14-year-old Lü Haotian in the second round. Dale&#x27;s best run in the PTC&#x27;s came at Event Three by reaching the semi-finals in a run that included a 4–2 over Mark Selby, but he lost to world number 65 Rod Lawler 0–4. Dale finished 28th on the Order of Merit, just outside the top 26 who qualified for the Finals. Dale reached the opening round of the World Championship by dispatching Alfie Burden 10–5 and played Judd Trump at this stage for the second successive year where he was defeated 10–5. His end of season ranking was world number 23 for the second year in a row.

===2013/2014 season===

Dale reached his second quarter-final in the Australian Goldfields Open in three years in the early stages of the 2013–14 season. He eliminated Mike Dunn and Fergal O&#x27;Brien, but then lost 5–1 to Marco Fu.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the next four ranking events he lost in the first round of two and failed qualify for both of the others.

In January 2014, Dale won the Snooker Shoot-Out final in Blackpool, beating Stuart Bingham in a close frame. Dale had received significant support from the crowd and had promised to sing My Way should he win the event. In his post-match interview he sang a short rendition of the song, showcasing an impressive baritone voice. The result seemed to kick start his season as the following week he beat Steve Davis and John Higgins at the German Masters, but let a 3–1 lead slip in the last 16 against Ding Junhui to lose 5–3. Dale also won two matches before falling at the third round in the Welsh Open and World Open, losing to Mark Selby and Alan McManus respectively.

Dale qualified for the World Championship courtesy of defeating Andrew Higginson in the final round of qualifying. He faced Mark Davis in the first round and beat him 10–5, marking his first win at the Crucible since 2000. Dale followed this up with a 13–4 win over Michael Wasley (who had beaten pre-tournament second favourite Ding Junhui in his opening match) to reach the quarter-finals for the second time, 14 years after the first. Dale played Barry Hawkins and trailed 11–5 after the second session, but then amazingly won seven frames in a row to be just one away from reaching the semi-finals and matching the biggest comeback at this stage ever at the Crucible. However, Hawkins won the two frames he required without giving Dale a chance to beat him 13–12. Later, Dale revealed that he had reverted to an old cue action before the start of the final session.

===2014/2015 season===
Dale lost 5–3 to Mark Davis in the first round of the Australian Goldfields Open and he reached the semi-finals of the Six-red World Championship, where Ricky Walden beat him 7–1.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the Shanghai Masters he knocked out Judd Trump 5–2, before losing 5–1 to Stuart Bingham. This last 16 defeat would prove to be Dale&#x27;s best finish in a ranking event this season as he could not win another match at a venue until the China Open, when he ousted Jimmy Robertson 5–3, but then fell 5–2 to Barry Hawkins in the second round. He had a consistent year in the minor-ranking European Tour events with a pair of last 16 exits helping him to finish 25th on the Order of Merit to claim the last qualification place for the Grand Final, where he was whitewashed 4–0 by Mark Selby in the opening round.

===2015/2016 season===
At the International Championship, Dale defeated Matthew Selt 6–1 and then lost 6–3 to Joe Perry in the second round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His second round match with Peter Ebdon at the UK Championship finished at 1:30am as Dale relinquished a 5–4 advantage to be beaten 6–5. Breaks of 72, 73, 82 and 61 saw Dale sneak past Mark Williams in the opening round of the Players Championship Finals 4–3, before he lost 4–1 to Shaun Murphy. Dale won more than one match at a ranking event for the only time this season when he knocked out Jamie Jones and Darryl Hill at the China Open, but then was beaten 6–1 by Stephen Maguire in the third round.

===2016/2017 season===

Dale saw off Ishpreet Chadha 4–2 and Marco Fu 4–0 to reach the third round of the Indian Open, where he lost 4–1 to Peter Ebdon. At the Paul Hunter Classic he enjoyed victories over Ben Woollaston, Ian Glover, Michael Holt, Yan Bingtao and Jimmy White to play in the semi-finals of a ranking event for the first time since 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dale was defeated 4–2 by Mark Selby. He lost in the second round of the International Championship 6–2 to Stuart Bingham and won three frames in a row to take his third round match with Shaun Murphy at the UK Championship in to a final-frame decider. He had chances in it but could not take them to be ousted 6–5. In the final World Championship qualifying round Dale made the 200th century break of his career, but would be defeated 10–5 by Luca Brecel.

===2023/2024 season===
At the 2025 World Championship, Dale, aged 52, became the oldest qualifier to reach the main draw since Steve Davis in 2010, but was beaten 110 by Kyren Wilson in the first round.

==Personal life==
Dale was originally named &quot;Chris&quot; but changed his name while working at a law firm, as they offered to do it for free. He chose &quot;Dominic&quot; because he worked with two people called Dominic and Dominique and said he just &quot;liked the name&quot;.

Dale&#x27;s personality, dress sense and hair styles make him one of the more flamboyant players on the circuit. In his early years he wore a white suit with colourful shirts. In 2007 he sported bleached blonde hair with a bright pink shirt. His interests include snooker memorabilia, Art Deco and operatic singing. After his Shanghai Masters semi-final win, he celebrated by singing &quot;My Way&quot; at the post-match conference. and also did so after his victory in 2014 Snooker Shoot-Out. In December 2007 Dale moved to Vienna with his then girlfriend. His form declined after this move, which he attributed to not having a professional training partner in Vienna, and he returned to live in the UK four years later, although only for a year.

<doc id="716657" wikidata="Q1144461" url="?curid=716657" title="Japanese Brazilians">
<text>are Brazilian citizens who are nationals or naturals of Japanese ancestry or Japanese immigrants living in Brazil or Japanese people of Brazilian ancestry. Japanese immigration to Brazil peaked between 1908 and 1960, with the highest concentration between 1926 and 1935. In 2022, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that there were 2 million Japanese descendants in Brazil, making it the country with the largest population of Japanese origin outside Japan. However, in terms of Japanese citizens, Brazil ranked seventh in 2023, with 46.9 thousand Japanese citizens. Most of the Japanese-descendant population in Brazil has been living in the country for three or more generations and most only hold Brazilian citizenship. Nikkei is the term used to refer to Japanese people and their descendants.

Japanese immigration to Brazil officially began on June 18, 1908, when the ship &quot;Kasato Maru&quot; docked at Porto de Santos, bringing 781 Japanese workers to the coffee plantations in the São Paulo state countryside. For this reason, June 18 was established as the national day of Japanese immigration. Immigration to Brazil ceased by 1973, with the arrival of the last immigrant ship, the &quot;Nippon Maru&quot;. Between 1908 and 1963, 242,171 Japanese immigrants arrived in Brazil, making them the fifth-largest immigrant group after Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and German immigrants. Currently, most Japanese Brazilians live in the states of São Paulo and Paraná.

In the early 20th century, Japan was overpopulated, and its predominantly rural population experienced significant poverty. At the same time, the Brazilian government was encouraging immigration, especially to supply labor for coffee plantations in São Paulo. Coffee was Brazil&#x27;s main export product, and the country&#x27;s financial health relied on it. Much of the labor on Brazilian coffee plantations came from Italian immigrants, whose passage by ship was subsidized by the Brazilian government. However, in 1902, the Italian government issued the Prinetti Decree, which banned subsidized immigration to Brazil due to reports that Italian immigrants were being exploited as laborers on Brazilian farms. Consequently, the São Paulo government sought new sources of labor from other countries, including Japan, and Japanese immigration to Brazil developed in this context.

Labor contracts on coffee plantations required immigrants to work for five years, but conditions were so poor that many left within the first year. Through great effort, some Japanese workers managed to save enough to buy their own land, with the first Japanese land purchase occurring in 1911 in the São Paulo countryside. Over the decades, Japanese immigrants and their descendants gradually moved from rural areas to Brazilian cities. By the early 1960s, the Japanese Brazilian urban population had surpassed the rural one. Many Japanese immigrants began working in small businesses or providing basic services. In Japanese tradition, the eldest son would continue the family business to help support his younger siblings&#x27; education. By 1958, Japanese and their descendants, though less than 2% of the Brazilian population, accounted for 21% of Brazilians with education beyond high school. A 2016 IPEA study found that Japanese descendants had the highest average educational and salary levels in Brazil. With Brazil&#x27;s economic deterioration from the late 1980s, many Japanese descendants from Brazil began migrating to Japan, in search of better economic conditions. These individuals are known as Dekasseguis.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Between the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, coffee was the main export product of Brazil. At first, Brazilian farmers used African slave labour in the coffee plantations, but in 1850, the slave trade was abolished in Brazil. To solve the labour shortage, the Brazilian elite decided to attract European immigrants to work on the coffee plantations. This was also consistent with the government&#x27;s push towards &quot;whitening&quot; the country. The hope was that through procreation the large African and Native American groups would be eliminated or reduced. The government and farmers offered to pay European immigrants&#x27; passage. The plan encouraged millions of Europeans, most of them Italians, to migrate to Brazil. However, once in Brazil, the immigrants received very low salaries and worked in poor conditions, including long working hours and frequent ill-treatment by their bosses. Because of this, in 1902, Italy enacted the Prinetti Decree, prohibiting subsidized emigration to Brazil.

Japan had been isolated from the rest of the world during the 265 years of the Edo period (Tokugawa Shogunate), without wars, epidemics brought in from abroad or emigration. With the agricultural techniques of the time, Japan produced only the food it consumed, with practically no formation of stocks for difficult periods. Any agricultural crop failure caused widespread famine. The end of the Tokugawa Shogunate gave way to an intense project of modernization and opening to the outside world during the Meiji era. Despite the agrarian reform, mechanization of agriculture made thousands of peasants unemployed. Thousands of other small peasants became indebted or lost their land because they could not pay the high taxes.

The end of feudalism in Japan generated great poverty in the rural population, so many Japanese people began to emigrate in search of better living conditions. By the 1930s, Japanese industrialisation had significantly boosted the population. However, prospects for Japanese people to migrate to other countries were limited. The United States had banned non-white immigration from some parts of the world on the basis that they would not integrate into society; this Exclusion Clause, of the 1924 Immigration Act, specifically targeted the Japanese. At the same time in Australia, the White Australia Policy prevented the immigration of non-whites to Australia.

=== First immigrants ===
In 1907, the Brazilian and the Japanese governments signed a treaty permitting Japanese migration to Brazil. This was due in part to the decrease in the Italian immigration to Brazil and a new labour shortage on the coffee plantations. Also, Japanese immigration to the United States had been barred by the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907. The first Japanese immigrants (781 people – mostly farmers) came to Brazil in 1908 on the . About half of these immigrants were Okinawans from southern Okinawa, who had faced 29 years of oppression by the Japanese government following the Ryukyu Islands&#x27;s annexation, becoming the first Ryukyuan Brazilians. They travelled from the Japanese port of Kobe via the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Many of them worked on coffee plantations.

In the first seven years, 3,434 more Japanese families (14,983 people) arrived. The beginning of World War I in 1914 started a boom in Japanese migration to Brazil. Between 1917 and 1940, over 164,000 Japanese came to Brazil, with 90% of them going to São Paulo, where most of the coffee plantations were located.

=== New life in Brazil ===
The vast majority of Japanese immigrants intended to work a few years in Brazil, make some money, and go home. However, &quot;getting rich quick&quot; was a dream that was almost impossible to achieve. This was exacerbated by the fact that it was obligatory for Japanese immigrants to Brazil prior to the Second World War to emigrate in familial units. Because multiple persons necessitated monetary support in these familial units, Japanese immigrants found it nearly impossible to return home to Japan even years after emigrating to Brazil. The immigrants were paid a very low salary and worked long hours of exhausting work. Also, everything that the immigrants consumed had to be purchased from the landowner (see truck system). Soon, their debts became very significant. Contrary to the plan, only 10% of the nearly 190,000 Japanese who immigrated to Brazil before the Second World War returned to Japan.
On 1 August 1908, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that relations between Brazil and Japan at the time were &quot;not extremely cordial&quot;, because of &quot;the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese labourers.&quot;

The landowners in Brazil still had a slavery mentality. Immigrants, although employees, had to confront the rigidity and lack of labour laws. Indebted and subjected to hours of exhaustive work, often suffering physical violence, suicide, (to escape at night), and strikes were some of the attitudes taken by many Japanese because of the exploitation on coffee farms. Even when they were free of their contractual obligations on Brazil&#x27;s coffee plantations, it was often impossible for immigrants to return home due to their meager earnings.

However, through a system called &quot;partnership farming&quot;, in a contract with a landowner, in which the immigrants committed themselves to deforesting the land, sowing coffee, taking care of the plantation and returning the area in seven years&#x27; time, when the second harvest would be ready, the immigrants could keep the profits from the first harvest, taking into account that the coffee cultivation is biannual. They also kept everything they planted, in addition to coffee. In this way, many Japanese managed to save some money and buy their first pieces of land in Brazil. The first land purchase by the Japanese in Brazil took place in São Paulo, in 1911.

Many Japanese immigrants purchased land in rural Brazil, having been forced to invest what little capital they had into land in order to someday make enough to return to Japan. As independent farmers, Japanese immigrants formed communities that were ethnically isolated from the rest of Brazilian society. The immigrants who settled and formed these communities referred to themselves as and their settlements as . In 1940, the Superintendence of Coffee Business issued that even though the Japanese living in São Paulo made up only 3.5% of the state&#x27;s population, they were responsible for 100% of the production of ramie, silk, peaches and strawberries; 99% of mint and tea; 80% of potatoes and vegetables; 70% of eggs; 50% of bananas; 40% of the cotton and 20% of the coffee produced by the state of São Paulo.

Japanese children born in Brazil were educated in schools founded by the Japanese community. Most only learned to speak the Japanese language and lived within the Japanese community in rural areas. Over the years, many Japanese managed to buy their own land and became small farmers. They started to plant strawberries, tea and rice. Only 6% of children were the result of interracial relationships. Immigrants rarely accepted marriage with a non-Japanese person.

By the 1930s, Brazilians complained that the independent Japanese communities had formed , or &quot;racial cysts&quot;, and were unwilling to further integrate the Japanese Brazilians into Brazilian society. The Japanese government, via the Japanese consulate in São Paulo, was directly involved with the education of Japanese children in Brazil. Japanese education in Brazil was modeled after education systems in Japan, and schools in Japanese communities in Brazil received funding directly from the Japanese government. By 1933, there were 140,000–150,000 Japanese Brazilians, which was by far the largest Japanese population in any Latin American country.

With Brazil under the leadership of Getúlio Vargas and the Empire of Japan involved on the Axis side in World War II, Japanese Brazilians became more isolated from their mother country. Japanese leaders and diplomats in Brazil left for Japan after Brazil severed all relations with Japan on 29 January 1942, leading Japanese Brazilians to fend for themselves in an increasingly hostile country. Vargas&#x27;s regime instituted several measures that targeted the Japanese population in Brazil, including the loss of freedom to travel within Brazil, censorship of Japanese newspapers (even those printed in Portuguese), and imprisonment if Japanese Brazilians were caught speaking Japanese in public. Japanese Brazilians became divided amongst themselves, and some even turned to performing terrorist acts on Japanese farmers who were employed by Brazilian farmers. By 1947, however, following the end of World War II, tensions between Brazilians and their Japanese population had cooled considerably. Japanese-language newspapers returned to publication and Japanese-language education was reinstituted among the Japanese Brazilian population. World War II had left Japanese Brazilians isolated from their mother country, censored by the Brazilian government, and facing internal conflicts within their own populations, but, for the most part, life returned to normal following the end of the war.

=== Prejudice and forced assimilation ===
On 28 July 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: &quot;The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited.&quot; On 22 October 1923, representative Fidélis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: &quot;The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country...&quot;

Some years before World War II, the government of President Getúlio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: &quot;The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited, the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien&quot;. The assimilationist project affected mainly
Japanese, Italian, Jewish, and German immigrants and their descendants.

The formation of &quot;ethnic cysts&quot; among immigrants of non-Portuguese origin prevented the realization of the whitening project of the Brazilian population. The government, then, started to act on these communities of foreign origin to force them to integrate into a &quot;Brazilian culture&quot; with Portuguese roots. It was the dominant idea of a unification of all the inhabitants of Brazil under a single &quot;national spirit&quot;. During World War II, Brazil severed relations with Japan. Japanese newspapers and teaching the Japanese language in schools were banned, leaving Portuguese as the only option for Japanese descendants. Newspapers in Italian or German were also advised to cease production, as Italy and Germany were Japan&#x27;s allies in the war. In 1939, research of Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, from São Paulo, showed that 87.7% of Japanese Brazilians read newspapers in the Japanese language, a high figure for a country with many illiterate people like Brazil at the time.

The Japanese appeared as undesirable immigrants within the &quot;whitening&quot; and assimilationist policy of the Brazilian government. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: &quot;They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble&quot;. The Brazilian magazine &quot;O Malho&quot; in its edition of 5 December 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: &quot;The government of São Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours&quot;. In 1941, the Brazilian Minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in São Paulo and wrote: &quot;their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country&#x27;s worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil&quot;.

The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without safe conduct issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco América do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations of &quot;activities against national security&quot; arising from disagreements between neighbors, recovery of debts and even fights between children. Japanese Brazilians were arrested for &quot;suspicious activity&quot; when they were in artistic meetings or picnics. On 10 July 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German and Italian immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in Baixada Santista, the Japanese had to have a safe conduct. In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tomé-Açu, in Pará, was virtually turned into a &quot;concentration camp&quot;. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to &quot;internment camps&quot; without the need for legal support, in the same manner as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against &quot;national security&quot; was confirmed.

During the National Constituent Assembly of 1946, the representative of Rio de Janeiro Miguel Couto Filho proposed Amendments to the Constitution as follows: &quot;It is prohibited the entry of Japanese immigrants of any age and any origin in the country&quot;. In the final vote, a tie with 99 votes in favour and 99 against. Senator Fernando de Melo Viana, who chaired the session of the Constituent Assembly, had the casting vote and rejected the constitutional amendment. By only one vote, the immigration of Japanese people to Brazil was not prohibited by the Brazilian Constitution of 1946.

The Japanese immigrants appeared to the Brazilian government as undesirable and non-assimilable immigrants. As Asian, they did not contribute to the &quot;whitening&quot; process of the Brazilian people as desired by the ruling Brazilian elite. In this process of forced assimilation the Japanese, more than any other immigrant group, suffered the ethno-cultural persecution imposed during this period.

=== Prestige ===
For decades, Japanese Brazilians were seen as a non-assimilable people. The immigrants were treated only as a reserve of cheap labour that should be used on coffee plantations and that Brazil should avoid absorbing their cultural influences. This widespread conception that the Japanese were negative for Brazil was changed in the following decades. The Japanese were able to overcome the difficulties along the years and drastically improve their lives through hard work and education; this was also facilitated by the involvement of the Japanese government in the process of migration. The image of hard working agriculturists that came to help develop the country and agriculture helped erase the lack of trust of the local population and create a positive image of the Japanese. In the 1970s, Japan became one of the richest countries of the world, synonymous with modernity and progress. In the same period, Japanese Brazilians achieved a great cultural and economic success, probably the immigrant group that most rapidly achieved progress in Brazil. Due to the powerful Japanese economy and due to the rapid enrichment of the Nisei, in the last decades Brazilians of Japanese descent achieved a social prestige in Brazil that largely contrasts with the aggression with which the early immigrants were treated in the country.

In the early 1960s, the Japanese Brazilian population in the cities already surpassed that of the countryside. As the vast majority of families that moved to São Paulo and cities in Paraná had few resources and were headed by first and second-generation Japanese, it was imperative that their business did not require a large initial investment or advanced knowledge of the Portuguese language. Thus, a good part of the immigrants began to dedicate themselves to small trade or to the provision of basic services, where dyeing stood out. In the 1970s, 80% of the 3,500 establishments that washed and ironed the clothes of São Paulo citizens were Japanese. According to anthropologist Célia Sakurai: &quot;The business was convenient for the families, because they could live at the back of the dye shop and do all the work without having to hire employees. In addition, the communication required by the activity was brief and simple&quot;.

In the Brazilian urban environment, the Japanese began to work mainly in sectors related to agriculture, such as traders or owners of small stores, selling fruit, vegetables or fish. Working with greengrocers and market stalls was facilitated by the contact that urban Japanese had with those who had stayed in the countryside, as suppliers were usually friends or relatives. Whatever the activity chosen by the family, it was up to the eldest children to work together with their parents. The custom was a Japanese tradition of delegating to the eldest son the continuation of the family activity and also the need to help pay for the studies of the younger siblings. While the older ones worked, the younger siblings enrolled in technical courses, such as Accountancy, mainly because it was easier to deal with numbers than with the Portuguese language. As for college, the Japanese favored engineering, medicine and law, which guaranteed money and social prestige. In 1958, Japanese descendants already represented 21% of Brazilians with education above secondary. In 1977, Japanese Brazilians, who made up 2.5% of the population of São Paulo, added up to 13% of those approved at the University of São Paulo, 16% of those who were admitted to the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) and 12% of those selected at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). According to a 1995 research conducted by Datafolha, 53% of adult Japanese Brazilians had a college degree, compared to only 9% of Brazilians in general.

According to the newspaper Gazeta do Povo, in Brazil &quot;common sense is that Japanese descendants are studious, disciplined, do well at school, pass the admission exams more easily and, in most cases, have great affinity for the exact science careers&quot;. According to a 2009 survey carried out with data from the University of São Paulo and Unesp, even though Japanese descendants were 1.2% of the population of the city of São Paulo and made up less than 4% of those enrolled in the entrance exams, they were about 15% of those approved.

A 2017 survey revealed that Brazilians of Japanese descent are the wealthiest group in Brazil. The survey concluded that Brazilians with a Japanese surname are the ones who earn the most (73.40 reais per hour):

== Integration and intermarriage ==
===Assimilation into Brazilian society===

The majority of Japanese immigrants who arrived before World War II did not intend to stay permanently in Brazil; they simply wanted to work for a few years, save money, and return to Japan. As a result, they did not care about assimilating into Brazilian society. The immigrants&#x27; children attended Japanese schools, in rural Brazil, where they learned not only the Japanese language but also how to be Japanese In these schools, they studied Japan&#x27;s history and geography but knew little about Brazil&#x27;s history and geography. They tried to live as if they had never left Japan.

This pattern changed with Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. At that time, many Japanese immigrants realized they were deeply rooted in Brazil and that returning to a war-ravaged Japan was no longer worth it. On the other hand, Japanese who immigrated to Brazil after the war arrived with different goals; having experienced the horrors of war, they aimed not to return to Japan but to make Brazil their new homeland. Consequently, Japanese immigrants who arrived after the war assimilated into Brazilian society more easily and tended not to transmit Japanese culture and language to their children as much as those who had arrived before the war. 

Convinced that they would no longer return to Japan, Japanese immigrants changed their expectations for their children as well, and the community stopped condemning Nisei (Brazilian-born children of Japanese immigrants) who did not speak Japanese. However, even before World War II, many Japanese immigrants had realized they would not return to Japan, beginning the initial movement toward &quot;Brazilianization.&quot; In the 1920s, many Japanese immigrants converted to Catholicism, Brazil&#x27;s predominant religion. The godparents chosen by the Japanese were almost always Brazilians, thus creating a link with the Brazilian people.

Successive generations of Japanese descendants, Sansei (third generation) and Yonsei (fourth generation), showed a greater degree of assimilation into Brazilian society than the Nisei (second generation), as the latter remained more immersed in their parents&#x27; Japanese culture compared to later generations, who were increasingly integrated into Brazilian culture.

However, &quot;Brazilianization&quot; did not mean a complete abandonment of Japanese values and traditions by the descendants. Japanese influence continued to manifest in various aspects, such as cuisine. Other values preserved by the descendants included an emphasis on discipline and education. According to a IBGE publication:

Despite assimilating into Brazilian society, even today Brazilians of Japanese descent are often not perceived as fully Brazilian and continue to be called — and to call themselves — &quot;Japanese,&quot; even though many are third or fourth generation in Brazil, have never set foot in Japan, do not speak Japanese, and do not hold Japanese citizenship. Thus, being &quot;Japanese&quot; in Brazil has little to do with nationality or culture but rather with physical traits. Brazilian society was historically formed by Indigenous, European, and African peoples and the miscegenation of these three groups. Therefore, what is conventionally considered &quot;Brazilian physical appearance&quot; was inherited from these three origins. In Brazil, no one questions that a Black person could be Brazilian, nor that the child of Italian or Spanish immigrants is also Brazilian. By contrast, descendants of Japanese people, because of their physical features reminiscent of the Asian country from which their ancestors came, carry the distinction of continuing to be seen as &quot;Japanese&quot; in the country where they were born. This occurs even among people of mixed heritage, or those who have only one Japanese parent. Mixed-heritage individuals who inherit more Japanese features continue to be labeled &quot;Japanese,&quot; while those with more non-Japanese features are more easily seen as &quot;Brazilian.&quot; Even individuals with origins in other countries of the Far East, such as China and Korea, are often called &quot;Japanese&quot; in Brazil. Ultimately, physical appearance, rather than nationality or culture, defines someone as &quot;Japanese&quot; in Brazil.

This differentiation is often reinforced by the descendants of Japanese themselves, as they may refer to other Brazilians as &quot;Brazilian&quot; or &quot;gaijin&quot; (foreigner, in Japanese), associating Brazilian identity with negative aspects, such as trickery and laziness. Yet, when they go to Japan, Brazilians of Japanese descent realize they are not considered Japanese, as they are not seen as such by native Japanese, shattering the illusion that they are &quot;Japanese.&quot; Thus, Japanese Brazilians experience a duality, being regarded as &quot;Japanese&quot; in Brazil but as &quot;Brazilians&quot; in Japan.

===Generations and intermarriage===

As of 1987, many Japanese Brazilians belonged to the third generation (sansei), who made up 41.33% of the community. First generation (issei) were 12.51%, second generation (nisei) were 30.85% and fourth generation (yonsei) 12.95%.

A census conducted in the late 1950s, with around 400,000 members of the Japanese Brazilian community, revealed that marriages between Japanese and non-Japanese represented less than 2% among first-generation immigrants and less than 6% in the whole Japanese Brazilian community. Japanese immigrants rarely married a non-Japanese person; however, their descendants, starting from the second and third generations, increasingly began to marry people of non-Japanese origin. By 1989, the rate of interethnic marriage was 45.9%.

By 1987, most Japanese Brazilians were still of full Japanese descent, with 28% having some non-Japanese ancestry. Only 6% of second-generation Japanese Brazilians (children) were mixed-race, but 42% of third-generation (grandchildren) were mixed and a majority of 61% of fourth-generation (great-grandchildren) were mixed 

Most of the fourth-generation Japanese Brazilians no longer have significant ties with the Japanese community. According to a 2008 study, only 12% of fourth-generation people lived with their grandparents and only 0.4% of them lived with their great-grandparents. In the past generations, many Japanese Brazilians lived in the countryside and it was common for at least three generations to live together, thus preserving Japanese culture. In a rural environment, the proximity between community members and the strength of family relationships meant that Japanese traditions remained more alive. However, over 90% of fourth-generation Japanese Brazilians live in urban areas, where relationships are generally more impersonal, and they tend to assimilate Brazilian customs more than Japanese ones. 

Some Japanese habits, however, resist – and culinary habits are among the most stubborn, as shown by a 2002 survey, which highlighted the influence of culture of origin on Nikkei students at the Federal University of Paraná (a third of them, yonsei). According to this study, although Brazilian dishes predominate on the menu of members of the fourth generation, they maintain the habit of frequently eating gohan (Japanese white rice, without seasoning) and consuming soy sauce, greens and vegetables cooked in the traditional way. The research also showed that the majority of the fourth generation do not speak Japanese, but understand basic domestic words and expressions. Some practices linked to the cult of ancestors, one of the pillars of Buddhism and Shintoism, also survive: many of them keep the butsudan at home, an altar on which photos of the family&#x27;s dead are placed, to whom relatives offer water, food and prayers. 

In 2005, a boy named Enzo Yuta Nakamura Onishi was the first sixth-generation person of Japanese descent to be born in Brazil. By 2022, less than 5% of Brazil&#x27;s Japanese-origin population was Japanese-born (down from 12.51% in 1987), given that Japanese immigration to Brazil practically ceased in the 1970s.

=== Religion ===
Immigrants, as well as most Japanese, were mostly followers of Shinto and Buddhism. In the Japanese communities in Brazil, there was a strong effort by Brazilian priests to proselytize the Japanese. More recently, intermarriage with Catholics also contributed to the growth of Catholicism in the community. Currently, 60% of Japanese-Brazilians are Roman Catholics and 25% are adherents of a Japanese religion.

=== Martial arts ===
The Japanese immigration to Brazil, in particular the immigration of the judoka Mitsuyo Maeda, resulted in the development of one of the most effective modern martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Japanese immigrants also brought sumo wrestling to Brazil, with the first tournament in the country organized in 1914. The country has a growing number of amateur sumo wrestlers, with the only purpose-built sumo arena outside Japan located in São Paulo. Brazil also produced (as of January 2022) sixteen professional wrestlers, with the most successful being Kaisei Ichirō.

=== Language ===

The knowledge of the Japanese and Portuguese languages reflects the integration of the Japanese in Brazil over several generations. Although first generation immigrants will often not learn Portuguese well or not use it frequently, most second generation are bilingual. The third generation, however, are most likely monolingual in Portuguese or speak, along with Portuguese, non-fluent Japanese.

A study conducted in the Japanese Brazilian communities of Aliança and Fukuhaku, both in the state of São Paulo, released information on the language spoken by these people. Before coming to Brazil, 12.2% of the first generation interviewed from Aliança reported they had studied the Portuguese language in Japan, and 26.8% said to have used it once on arrival in Brazil. Many of the Japanese immigrants took classes of Portuguese and learned about the history of Brazil before migrating to the country. In Fukuhaku only 7.7% of the people reported they had studied Portuguese in Japan, but 38.5% said they had contact with Portuguese once on arrival in Brazil. All the immigrants reported they spoke exclusively Japanese at home in the first years in Brazil. However, in 2003, the figure dropped to 58.5% in Aliança and 33.3% in Fukuhaku. This probably reflects that through contact with the younger generations of the family, who speak mostly Portuguese, many immigrants also began to speak Portuguese at home.

The first Brazilian-born generation, the Nisei, alternate between the use of Portuguese and Japanese. Regarding the use of Japanese at home, 64.3% of Nisei informants from Aliança and 41.5% from Fukuhaku used Japanese when they were children. In comparison, only 14.3% of the third generation, Sansei, reported to speak Japanese at home when they were children. It reflects that the second generation was mostly educated by their Japanese parents using the Japanese language. On the other hand, the third generation did not have much contact with their grandparent&#x27;s language, and most of them speak the national language of Brazil, Portuguese, as their mother tongue.

Japanese Brazilians usually speak Japanese more often when they live along with a first generation relative. Those who do not live with a Japanese-born relative usually speak Portuguese more often. Japanese spoken in Brazil is usually a mix of different Japanese dialects, since the Japanese community in Brazil came from all regions of Japan, influenced by the Portuguese language. The high numbers of Brazilian immigrants returning from Japan will probably produce more Japanese speakers in Brazil.

===Demographics===

In 1934, there were 131,639 Japanese immigrants living in Brazil, of whom 10,828 lived in urban areas and 120,811 in the countryside. In Brazil&#x27;s 1940 census, 144,523 Japanese immigrants were counted, more than 91% of whom were in the state of São Paulo. In the 1950 census, 129,192 Japanese were recorded, with 84.3% in São Paulo and 11.9% in Paraná. The data is shown in the table below:

The maximum number of Japanese residents in Brazil was recorded in the 1970 census: 154,000. The states with at least one thousand Japanese residents were: São Paulo (116,566), Paraná (20,644), Mato Grosso (3,466), Pará (3,349), Rio Grande do Sul (1,619), Rio de Janeiro (1,451), Minas Gerais (1,406), and Guanabara (1,380). Since Japanese immigration to Brazil practically ceased in the 1970s, by 2022 less than 5% of Brazil&#x27;s Japanese-origin population was Japanese-born, with over 95% being Brazilians whose Japanese ancestors immigrated to Brazil over the last five generations.
According to a publication by the Japanese-Brazilian Studies Center in 1988, there were 1,167,000 Japanese descendants in Brazil that year, of whom 290,000, or 24.8%, lived in the city of São Paulo, 156,000 (13.3%) in the Greater São Paulo area, and 382,000 (32.7%) in the rest of the state of São Paulo. Thus, 70.8% of the Japanese Brazilian population, or 828,000 people, lived in São Paulo state. In southern Brazil, mainly in Paraná, there were 142,000 Japanese descendants, or 12.2% of the total.

In 2008, IBGE published a book about the Japanese diaspora and it estimated that, as of 2000 there were 70,932 Japanese-born immigrants living in Brazil (compared to the 158,087 found in 1970). Of the Japanese, 51,445 lived in São Paulo. Most of the immigrants were over 60 years old, because the Japanese immigration to Brazil has ended since the mid-20th century. By 2023, the number of Japanese citizens living in Brazil had dropped further to 46,900.

Throughout Brazil, with more than 1.4 million people of Japanese descent, the highest percentages were found in the states of São Paulo (1.9% of Japanese descendants), Paraná (1.5%), and Mato Grosso do Sul (1.4%). The lowest percentages were found in Roraima and Alagoas (with only 8 Japanese residents). The percentage of Brazilians with Japanese roots increased especially among children and adolescents. In 1991, 0.6% of Brazilians aged 0 to 14 were of Japanese ancestry; in 2000, they were 4%, as a result of the return of dekassegui (Brazilians of Japanese descent working in Japan) to Brazil.

In the 2022 Brazilian census, 850,130 people identified as &quot;yellow,&quot; a designation by the IBGE for people of Asian descent: Japanese, Chinese, Korean. All municipalities with the highest proportions of yellow individuals were in the states of São Paulo (SP) and Paraná (PR), namely: Assaí (PR) – 11.05% of the population; Bastos (SP) – 10.3%; Uraí (PR) – 5.9%; São Sebastião da Amoreira (PR) – 4.8%; Pereira Barreto (SP) – 4.2%; Nova América da Colina (PR) – 3.8%; and Mogi das Cruzes (SP) – 3.7%. In numerical terms, the municipalities with the most yellow residents were São Paulo (238,603 people), Curitiba (23,635), Londrina (18,026), and Maringá (13,465).

In 2022, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that there were 2 million people of Japanese origin in Brazil, but only 47,472 had Japanese nationality.

The Japanese-origin population in Brazil is extremely urban. Whereas at the beginning of immigration almost all Japanese were in rural areas, by 1958, 55.1% were already in urban centers. In 1988, 90% resided in urban areas. This early rural exodus directly influenced the occupational profile and high education level of this group. While in 1958, 56% of the Nikkei population worked in agriculture, by 1988, that number had dropped to only 12%. Meanwhile, the percentages of technical (16%) and administrative (28%) workers in the secondary and tertiary sectors increased.

=== Japanese from Maringá ===
A 2008 census revealed details about the population of Japanese origin from the city of Maringá in Paraná, making it possible to have a profile of the Japanese-Brazilian population.

== Reversal in the migration flow (The Dekasegi) ==
Starting in the late 1980s, there was a reversal in the migration flow between Brazil and Japan. Brazil entered an economic crisis, known as &quot;Década Perdida&quot;, with inflation reaching 1,037.53% in 1988 and 1,782.85% in 1989. At the same time, Japan&#x27;s economy was experiencing impressive growth, making it one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The 1980s were called &quot;baburu keizai&quot; (the Japanese economic bubble). The crisis in Brazil and prosperity in Japan led approximately 85,000 Japanese and their descendants living in Brazil to move to Japan between 1980 and 1990. Brazilians who went to work in Japan became known as &quot;Dekasegis.&quot;

In the 1990s, the migration flow of Brazilians to Japan grew even more, thanks to the 1990 reform of Japan&#x27;s Immigration Control Law. With this law, Japan allowed Japanese descendants born abroad, up to the third generation (children and grandchildren of Japanese), to work in Japan with long-term residence visas. This was a way for the Japanese government to address the labor shortage in Japan without disrupting the country&#x27;s ethnic homogeneity, with a clear preference given to Latin Americans, mostly Brazilians, of Japanese descent. At that time, Japan was receiving a large number of illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand. The legislation of 1990 was intended to select immigrants who entered Japan, giving a clear preference for Japanese descendants from South America, especially Brazil. Consequently, between 1990 and 2000, the number of Brazilians in Japan quintupled, reaching 250,000 people. This law also allowed Japanese descendants to bring their spouses without Japanese ancestry.

Because of their Japanese ancestry, the Japanese government believed that Brazilians would be more easily integrated into Japanese society. In fact, this easy integration did not happen, since Japanese Brazilians and their children born in Japan are treated as foreigners by native Japanese. This apparent contradiction between being and seeming causes conflicts of adaptation for the migrants and their acceptance by the natives.

Most Brazilians who go to work in Japan are not poor, but rather middle-class individuals, who were particularly affected by Brazil&#x27;s economic crises. This population, attempting to maintain or improve their standard of living, began seeking better economic conditions in Japan, the country of their ancestors. These people were lured to Japan to work in areas that the Japanese refused (the so-called &quot;three K&quot;: , and – hard, dirty and dangerous).
 Many Brazilians go to Japan intending to work temporarily and later return with financial savings. However, these intentions are not always fulfilled, and many Brazilians opted to stay permanently in Japan.

By 2007, there were 313,770 Brazilians legally residing in Japan. Cities and prefectures with the most Brazilians in Japan were Hamamatsu, Aichi, Shizuoka, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Gunma. Brazilians in Japan are usually educated. However, they are employed in the Japanese automotive and electronics factories. Many Brazilians are subjected to hours of exhausting work, earning a small salary by Japanese standards. Nevertheless, in 2002, Brazilians living in Japan sent US$2.5 billion to Brazil.

Due to the severe financial crisis that hit Japan starting in 2008, many Brazilians returned to Brazil. By 2014, the Brazilian community in the country had decreased to 177,953 people. On the other hand, in 2023, the Brazilian community in Japan grew again, totaling 211,840 people.

In 2018, there was a new amendment to the Japanese immigration law, allowing descendants of Japanese born abroad up to the fourth generation (great-grandchildren) to work in Japan. However, for great-grandchildren, the law established stricter requirements, including an age limit and proof of Japanese language proficiency. As a result, few visas were issued: the Japanese government expected to grant 4,000 visas annually, but only 43 applications were approved in the first year of the new legislation, 17 of them to Brazilians.

In 2022, Brazilians formed the fourth-largest community of foreign workers residing in Japan, after the Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos. In 2023, the Brazilian community in Japan was the fifth-largest Brazilian community outside Brazil, surpassed only by the communities in the United States, Portugal, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom.

=== Brazilian identity in Japan ===
In Japan, many Japanese Brazilians suffer prejudice because they do not know how to speak Japanese fluently. Despite their Japanese appearance, Brazilians in Japan are culturally Brazilians, usually only speaking Portuguese, and are treated as foreigners.

The children of Brazilians encounter difficulties in Japanese schools. Thousands of Brazilian children are out of school in Japan.

The Brazilian influence in Japan is growing. Tokyo has the largest carnival parade outside of Brazil itself. Portuguese is the third most spoken foreign language in Japan, after Chinese and Korean, and is among the most studied languages by students in the country. In Oizumi, it is estimated that 15% of the population speak Portuguese as their native language. Japan has two newspapers in the Portuguese language, besides radio and television stations spoken in that language. The Brazilian fashion and Bossa Nova music are also popular among Japanese. In 2005, there were an estimated 302,000 Brazilian nationals in Japan, of whom 25,000 also hold Japanese citizenship.

== 100th anniversary ==
In 2008, many celebrations took place in Japan and Brazil to remember the centenary of Japanese immigration. Then-Prince Naruhito of Japan arrived in Brazil on 17 June to participate in the celebrations. He visited Brasília, São Paulo, Paraná, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Throughout his stay in Brazil, the Prince was received by a crowd of Japanese immigrants and their descendants. He broke the protocol of the Japanese Monarchy, which prohibits physical contact with people, and greeted the Brazilian people. In the São Paulo sambódromo, the Prince spoke to 50,000 people and in Paraná to 75,000. He also visited the University of São Paulo, where people of Japanese descent make up 14% of the 80,000 students. Naruhito, then the crown prince of Japan, gave a speech that he concluded with a thank you in Portuguese.

== Media ==
In São Paulo there are two Japanese publications, the &quot;São Paulo Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Nikkey Shimbun&quot;. The former was established in 1946 and the latter was established in 1998. The latter has a Portuguese edition, the , and both publications have Portuguese websites. The , established in 1947, and the , established in 1949, are the predecessors of the &quot;Nikkey Shimbun&quot;.

The &quot;Nambei&quot;, published in 1916, was Brazil&#x27;s first Japanese newspaper. In 1933 90% of East Asian-origin Brazilians read Japanese publications, including 20 periodicals, 15 magazines, and five newspapers. The increase of the number of publications was due to Japanese immigration to Brazil. The government banned publication of Japanese newspapers during World War II.

Tatiane Matheus of stated that in the pre-World War II period the &quot;Nippak Shimbun&quot;, established in 1916; the , established in 1917; and two newspapers established in 1932, the and the , were the most influential Japanese newspapers. All were published in São Paulo.

== Education ==

Japanese international day schools in Brazil include the Escola Japonesa de São Paulo (&quot;São Paulo Japanese School&quot;), the Escola Japonesa do Rio de Janeiro in the Cosme Velho neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, and the Escola Japonesa de Manaus. The Escola Japonesa de Belo Horizonte (ベロ・オリゾンテ日本人学校), and Japanese schools in Belém and Vitória previously existed; all three closed, and their certifications by the Japanese education ministry (MEXT) were revoked on March 29, 2002 (Heisei 14).

There are also supplementary schools teaching the Japanese language and culture. As of 2003, in southeast and south regions of the country there hundreds of Japanese supplementary schools. The Japan Foundation in São Paulo&#x27;s coordinator of projects in 2003 stated that São Paulo State has about 500 supplementary schools. Around 33% of the Japanese supplementary schools in southeastern Brazil are in the city of São Paulo. As of 2003 almost all of the directors of the São Paulo schools were women.

MEXT recognizes one part-time Japanese school (hoshu jugyo ko or hoshuko), the Escola Suplementar Japonesa de Curitiba in Curitiba. MEXT-approved hoshukos in Porto Alegre and Salvador have closed.

=== History of education ===
The Taisho School, Brazil&#x27;s first Japanese language school, opened in 1915 in São Paulo. In some areas full-time Japanese schools opened because no local schools existed in the vicinity of the Japanese settlements. In 1932 over 10,000 Nikkei Brazilian children attended almost 200 Japanese supplementary schools in São Paulo. By 1938 Brazil had a total of 600 Japanese schools.

In 1970, 22,000 students, taught by 400 teachers, attended 350 supplementary Japanese schools. In 1992 there were 319 supplementary Japanese language schools in Brazil with a total of 18,782 students, 10,050 of them being female and 8,732 of them being male. Of the schools, 111 were in São Paulo State and 54 were in Paraná State. At the time, the São Paulo Metropolitan Area had 95 Japanese schools, and the schools in the city limits of São Paulo had 6,916 students.

In the 1980s, São Paulo Japanese supplementary schools were larger than those in other communities. In general, during that decade a Brazilian supplementary Japanese school had one or two teachers responsible for around 60 students.

Hiromi Shibata, a PhD student at the University of São Paulo, wrote the dissertation , published in 1997. Jeff Lesser, author of &quot;Negotiating National Identity: Immigrants, Minorities, and the Struggle for Ethnicity in Brazil&quot;, wrote that the author &quot;suggests&quot; that the Japanese schools in São Paulo &quot;were as much an affirmation of Nipo-Brazilian identity as they were of Japanese nationalism.&quot;

<text>Robert Chaperon (born 18 May 1958) is a Canadian retired professional snooker and billiards player.

==Career==
Chaperon was born on 18 May 1958. He played snooker on the professional tour from 1984 to 1995, and in the 1998/99, 2000/01, 2002/03 seasons, and also participated in the World Snooker Americas Tour in 1998/99, 1999/2000 and 2001/02. He won the 1990 British Open, beating Alex Higgins 10–8 in Higgins&#x27; last appearance in a major final. He reached one other ranking quarter-final, at the 1987 Grand Prix. He also won the 1990 World Cup as a member of the Canadian team, and the Canadian Snooker Championship in 1981, defeating Carey Lorraine in Ottawa. Having not played competitively for about three years, Chaperon resumed in 2007. In October 2019 he won a qualifier for the 2020 World Seniors Championship and although he was due to play in the event at the Crucible Theatre in August 2020, did not participate in the tournament. He finally made his return after 30 years to crucible in 2022 at the World Seniors but lost in the last 24 3-1 to Phillip Williams

His highest world ranking as a professional was 25.

<doc id="716664" wikidata="Q4318555" url="?curid=716664" title="Nigrostriatal pathway">
<text>The nigrostriatal pathway is a bilateral dopaminergic pathway in the brain that connects the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in the midbrain with the dorsal striatum (i.e., the caudate nucleus and putamen) in the forebrain. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain, and is critical in the production of movement as part of a system called the basal ganglia motor loop. Dopaminergic neurons of this pathway release dopamine from axon terminals that synapse onto GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), also known as spiny projection neurons (SPNs), located in the striatum.

Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc is one of the main pathological features of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, leading to a marked reduction in dopamine function and the symptomatic motor deficits of Parkinson&#x27;s disease including hypokinesia, tremors, rigidity, and postural imbalance.

== Anatomy ==
The connection between the substantia nigra pars compacta and the dorsal striatum is mediated via dopaminergic axons.

=== Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) ===
The substantia nigra is located in the ventral midbrain of each hemisphere. It has two distinct parts, the pars compacta (SNc) and the pars reticulata (SNr). The pars compacta contains dopaminergic neurons from the A9 cell group that forms the nigrostriatal pathway that, by supplying dopamine to the striatum, relays information to the basal ganglia. In contrast, the pars reticulata contains mostly GABAergic neurons.

The SNc is composed of a thin band of cells that overlies the SNr and is situated laterally to the A10 group of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that forms the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The SNc is easily visualized in human brain sections because the dopamine neurons contain a black pigment called neuromelanin which is known to accumulate with age. The dopaminergic cell bodies in the SNc are densely packed with approximately 200,000 to 420,000 dopamine cells in human SNc and 8,000 to 12,000 dopamine cells in mouse SNc. These dopamine cell bodies are localized to one of two chemically defined layers. Those in the upper layer (or dorsal tier) contain a binding protein called calbindin-D28K which can buffer calcium levels inside the cell when it becomes too high or toxic. Dopamine cells in the lower layer (or ventral tier) lack this protein and are more vulnerable to the effects of neurotoxins (e.g. MPTP) that can cause Parkinson disease-like symptoms. The dorsal tier dopamine cells have dendrites that radiate horizontally across the pars compacta, whereas ventral tier dopamine cells have dendrites that extend ventrally into the pars reticulata.

=== Dopaminergic axons ===
The axons from dopamine neurons emanate from a primary dendrite and project ipsilaterally (on the same side) via the medial forebrain bundle to the dorsal striatum. There is a rough topographical correlation between the anatomical localization of the dopamine cell body within the SNc and the area of termination in the dorsal striatum. Dopaminergic cells in the lateral parts of the SNc project mainly to the lateral and caudal (posterior) parts of the striatum, whereas dopamine cells in the medial SNc project to the medial striatum. In addition, dopamine cells in the dorsal tier project to the ventromedial striatum, whereas the ventral tier neurons project to the dorsal caudate nucleus and putamen. In general, there is a greater density of dopaminergic input to the dorsolateral striatum.

Each dopamine neuron has an extremely large unmyelinated axonal arborization which can innervate up to 6% of the striatal volume in a rat. Although all SNc dopamine cells project to both the striosome (or patch) and matrix neurochemical compartments of the striatum, most of the axonal territory of a dorsal tier neuron is in the matrix compartment while the majority of the axonal field of ventral tier neurons is in the striosomes. Nigrostriatal dopamine axons can also give rise to axon collaterals that project to other brain regions. For example, some SNc nigrostriatal dopamine axons send axon collaterals to the pedunculopontine nucleus, ventral pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, amygdala, and thalamus.

A small number of SNc dorsal tier dopamine neurons also project directly to the cortex, although most of the dopaminergic innervation of the cortex comes from the adjacent VTA dopamine neurons.

===Dorsal striatum===
The dorsal striatum is located in the subcortical region of the forebrain. In primates and other mammals, it is divided by the anterior limb of a white matter tract called the internal capsule into two parts: the caudate nucleus and the putamen. In rodents, the internal capsule is poorly developed such that the caudate and putamen are not separated but form one large entity called the caudate putamen (CPu). The majority (about 95%) of cells in the dorsal striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), also known as spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Approximately half of these MSNs contain dopamine D1 receptors and project directly to the substantia nigra to form the direct pathway of the basal ganglia, whereas the other half express dopamine D2 receptors that project indirectly to the substantia nigra via the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus to form the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. The remaining 5% of cells are interneurons that are either cholinergic neurons or one of several types of GABAergic neurons. The axons and dendrites of these interneurons stay within the striatum.

The caudate nucleus and putamen receive excitatory information from all areas of the cerebral cortex. These glutamatergic inputs are generally topographically arranged such that the putamen takes information largely from the sensorimotor cortex, whereas the caudate nucleus obtains information largely from the association cortex. In addition, the dorsal striatum receives excitatory inputs from other brain structures like the thalamus, and minor excitatory inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala.

The dorsal striatum contains neurochemically defined compartments called striosomes (also known as patches) that exhibit dense μ-opioid receptor staining embedded within a matrix compartment that contains higher acetylcholinesterase and calbindin-D28K.

The dopaminergic axon terminals of the nigrostriatal pathway synapse onto GABAergic MSNs in the dorsal striatum. They form synapses on the cell body and dendritic shaft regions but mostly on the necks of dendritic spines that also receive glutamatergic input to the heads of the same dendritic spines.

== Function ==
The main function of the nigrostriatal pathway is to influence voluntary movement through basal ganglia motor loops. Along with the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways, the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway can also influence other brain functions, including cognition, reward, and addiction. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons exhibit tonic and phasic patterns of neuronal firing activity. This can lead to different patterns of dopamine release from the axon terminals in the dorsal striatum and also from the cell body (soma) and dendrites in the SNc and SNr. As well as releasing dopamine, some axons in the nigrostriatal pathway can also co-release GABA.

The nigrostriatal pathway influences movement through two pathways, the direct pathway of movement and the indirect pathway of movement.

=== Direct pathway of movement ===
The direct pathway is involved in facilitation of wanted movements. The projections from dopamine D1 receptors containing medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen synapse onto tonically active GABAergic cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), which then project to the thalamus. Because the striatonigral / striatoentopeduncular and nigrothalamic pathways are inhibitory, activation of the direct pathway creates an overall net excitatory effect on the thalamus and on movement generated by the motor cortex.

=== Indirect pathway of movement ===
The indirect pathway is involved in suppressing unwanted movement. The projections from dopamine D2 receptors containing medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen synapse onto tonically active GABAergic cells in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), which then projects to the substantia nigra pars reticulata via the excitatory subthalmic nucleus (STN). Because the striatopallidal and nigrothalamic pathways are inhibitory but the subthalamic to nigra pathway is excitatory, activation of the indirect pathway creates an overall net inhibitory effect on the thalamus and on movement by the motor cortex.

==Clinical significance==

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===

Parkinson&#x27;s disease is characterized by severe motor problems, mainly hypokinesia, rigidity, tremors, and postural imbalance. Loss of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway is one of the main pathological features of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Degeneration of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the putamen-caudate complex leads to diminished concentrations of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, leading to reduced function and the characteristic symptoms. The symptoms of the disease typically do not show themselves until 80-90% of dopamine function has been lost. 

Another hypothesis suggests that Parkinson&#x27;s disease is an imbalance between dopamine (D.A.) and acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal striatum, and not just dopamine deficiency.

==== Levodopa-induced dyskinesia ====

Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) is a complication associated with long-term use of the Parkinson&#x27;s treatment L-DOPA, characterized by involuntary movement and muscle contractions. This disorder occurs in up to 90% of patients after 9 years of treatment. The use of L-DOPA in patients can lead to interruption of nigrostriatal dopamine projections as well as changes in the post-synaptic neurons in the basal ganglia.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Presynaptic dopamine metabolism is altered in schizophrenia.

<text>La Aurora International Airport (, ) serves Guatemala City, Guatemala. It is located south of Guatemala City&#x27;s center and from Antigua Guatemala. It is administered by the General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics.

La Aurora International Airport is the primary airport of Guatemala. The airport went through a massive modernization and expansion. The airport is now able to accept a greater number of flights and larger aircraft. It provides high standard installations to the traveler. The old terminal has been renovated in accordance with its original design. It was partly demolished and was expanded with a new glass-designed concourse and is now able to accommodate up to twenty-two aircraft. The greater project was completed by December 2008. The airport currently has two terminals: Central and North.

The airport is the fourth-busiest in Central America in terms of passenger traffic behind Tocumen International Airport in Panamá, Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rica, and the El Salvador International Airport.

== Overview ==
La Aurora is being renovated, along with other airports in Guatemala, such as Mundo Maya International Airport, Quetzaltenango Airport, Puerto Barrios Airport, and San José Airport.

In July 2007, seven new gates were opened. These gates are equipped with jetway bridges and modern conveniences, also a new parking garage was also built and it can handle up to 500 vehicles.

There are brand new ticket counters. 2007 brought significant gate expansion (11 new gates were available starting December 2007). The airport now has two concourses. The northern concourse has 12 traditional gates and three remote gates. The central concourse, is used for larger aircraft as it provides 4–6 gates depending on the size of the aircraft.

The airport&#x27;s runway currently measures . There have been efforts in the past to expand the runway but this has not yet been possible since there is a commercial area to the north of the runway and a small ravine near the southern side of the runway. Still, the renovation of the runway is in progress. The first phase consists in repaving the runway as well modernizing the illumination system. Future plans to expand the taxiway repave and move all the cargo facilities to San José Airport in Escuintla and Puerto Barrios Airport in Izabal. This will make room for more passenger terminal area and improved taxiways. Finally, the airport administration building is being refurbished and a regional terminal is being built.

La Aurora International Airport has two exclusive VIP lounges: Los Añejos Business Lounge and Copa Club, a VIP lounge for passengers traveling on Copa Airlines and United Airlines.

Cargo operations are handled beside the passenger terminal building by COMBEX-IM or in the DHL hangars.

The head office of the General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics is located in the airport Zone 13.

China Airlines starts talks and negotiations with Guatemalan authorities Direccion General de Aeronautica Civil (Guatemala) about the possibility of opening operation flights from Taipei-taoyuan, Northern Taiwan, Republic Of China and making La Aurora International Airport a Focus City for Flights from China into Central America.

==History==
During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force defending the Central American coastline against Axis powers submarines. The first American personnel began arriving in December 1941; the airfield was improved and expanded by the United States&#x27; 805th Engineer Aviation Battalion in early 1942. During its period of American use, the military facilities of the airport were known as Guatemala City Air Base. Flying units assigned to the airport were:

* 51st Fighter Squadron (Detachment) (32d Fighter Group), 2 January 1942 – 9 March 1943, (P-40 Warhawk)
* 74th Bombardment Squadron (40th, 6th Bombardment Groups), 9 January 1942 – 7 April 1944 (B-18 Bolo, B-17 Flying Fortress)
* 44th Bombardment Squadron (40th Bombardment Group) 6 July 1942 – 4 June 1943, (B-18 Bolo)

Detachments from the airfield operated intermittently from San Jose Airport, San José, Costa Rica, and Puerto San José, Guatemala from 1942 though 1944. After the war ended, a small number of Americans remained at the airport performing training duties with the Guatemalan Air Force and also operating a weather station (MATS 6th Weather Squadron). United States personnel were restricted to base during the Guatemalan revolution following the death of Colonel Francisco Xavier Arana on 18 July 1949. Some artillery shells landed on the base during the violence. The facility was closed on 28 July 1949 and turned over to Guatemalan authorities.

In October 2004, Iberia introduced nonstop service to Madrid aboard Airbus A340s. The route resulted from the airline&#x27;s decision to shut down its Miami hub, where passengers previously had to change planes.

The airport was closed for six months in 2020, from March to September, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 1 March 1980, a Douglas C-47 of the Fuerza Aérea Guatemalteca was damaged beyond repair near La Aurora.
* On 6 April 1993, TACA Airlines Flight 510, a Boeing 767, ran off the end of Runway 19 (now Runway 20) after landing. A passenger on board filmed the landing, which showed a runway with standing water from a tropical storm which had just passed over. A great amount of runway had passed under the plane before touchdown and the pilot forced the landing. In spite of thrust reversers used, the plane could not slow down in time, began to shudder from excessive wheel-braking, the captain made a last second decision to steer the airplane to the left of the runway (avoiding a big ditch at the end of the runway), went down an embankment and stopped into some structures. Surprisingly, there were no fatalities and the only injured people were 3 non-passengers. The aircraft was written off.
*On 28 April 1995, Faucett Flight 705, a Douglas DC-8 leased by Million Air, overshot the runway and crashed into several houses. All three crew members onboard survived, but 6 people on the ground were killed.
*On 21 December 1999, Cubana de Aviación Flight 1216, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (leased to Cubana by AOM French Airlines) overshot runway 19 during landing and crashed into a residential area. 16 of the 314 people on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. 
* On 4 June 2018, the airport had to close due to the 2018 Volcán de Fuego eruption.

<text>Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment. It is independent of the moral dimension, which is called moral agency.

In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons&#x27; actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.

Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In &#x27;goal directed action&#x27; an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.

==Human agency==

Agency is contrasted to objects reacting to natural forces involving only unthinking deterministic processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of free will, the philosophical doctrine that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. &quot;How&quot; humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue.

The capacity of a human to act as an agent is personal to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a moral component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply value judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask &quot;should this have occurred?&quot; in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet Shoemaker–Levy on Jupiter.

===In philosophy===
The philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is action theory. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by Hegel and Marx), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel&#x27;s Geist and Marx&#x27;s universal class are idealist and materialist expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. There is ongoing debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of Hume, between determinism and indeterminacy.

Structure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the Marxist conception, &quot;agency&quot; refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas &quot;structure&quot; refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have.

===In other sciences===
Other notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics:

====In economics====

Economics stresses the purposive action of economic agents, who act to advance their subjective well-being given fundamental constraints. Thus, economic models typically begin with &quot;an agent&quot; maximizing some objective. In contract theory, economics also addresses the problem of agents who represent another party (the principal) potentially unfaithfully.

====In psychology====

The term of agency used in different fields of psychology with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality, which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of agents. This topic is thoroughly investigated by developmental and comparative psychologists to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous intelligent agency used in cybernetics. Agency can also imply the sense of agency, that is the feeling of ownership of control.

&quot;Emergent interactive agency&quot; defines Bandura&#x27;s view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency. Bandura formulates his view of agency as a socio-cognitive one, where people are self-organizing, proactive, self-regulating, and engage in self-reflection, and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one’s thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‘reciprocal causation’.

====In social cybernetics====

&quot;Autonomous agency&quot; is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self-organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency&#x27;s behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.

====In political economy====

Human agency refers to the ability to shape one’s life and a few dimensions can be differentiated. Individual agency is reflected in individual choices and the ability to influence one’s life conditions and chances. The individual agency differs strongly within the society across age, gender, income, education, personal health status, position in social networks, and other dimensions. Collective agency refers to situations in which individuals pool their knowledge, skills, and resources, and act in concert to shape their future. Everyday agency refers to consumer and daily choices, and finally strategic agency refers to the capacity to affect the wider system change. Political economy approaches can be used to conceptualize the agency enabling or limiting rule system, which constitutes the “grammar” for social action and that is used by the actors to structure and regulate their transactions with one another in defined situations or spheres of activity.

<doc id="716675" wikidata="Q452142" url="?curid=716675" title="Stephen Maguire">
<text>Stephen Maguire (born 13 March 1981) is a Scottish professional snooker player. He has won six major ranking tournaments, including the 2004 UK Championship, and has twice since reached the finals of that event. Maguire turned professional in 1998 after winning the IBSF World Snooker Championship. He was in the top 16 of the snooker world rankings for 11 consecutive years, from 2005 to 2016, twice reaching world no. 2. He is a prolific break-builder, having compiled over 500 century breaks, including three maximums.

==Career==
===Early career===
Maguire turned professional as a snooker player in 1998. He qualified for the 1999 UK Championship, where he was defeated 2–9 by Mark King in the first round. He played in qualifying for the 2000 World Championship, defeating Wayne Brown, Nick Walker and Bradley Jones to reach the final qualifying round, where he lost 9–10 to Joe Swail. Maguire qualified again for the 2002 UK Championship, going on to defeat Fergal O&#x27;Brien 9–4 in the first round, before losing 7–9 to Ken Doherty in the second.

Two years later, Maguire reached the final of his first world ranking event, the 2004 European Open. Ranked 41st in the world, he defeated Peter Ebdon and Joe Perry (both 5–4), John Higgins 5–3 and Stephen Lee 6–4 to meet Jimmy White in the final. He then defeated White 9–3 to win the championship. The BBC described Maguire as a &quot;surprising winner&quot;, and he admitted to being &quot;very surprised how badly everybody has played against me here&quot;. At the 2004 World Championship later that season, he qualified for the 32-player competition for the first time. He lost 6–10 in the opening round to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, who admitted to being impressed by Maguire&#x27;s performance and tipped him to be a future world champion.

The following season at the 2004 British Open, Maguire defeated O&#x27;Sullivan 6–1 in the semi-finals to reach his second ranking event final. This led to O&#x27;Sullivan claiming that he had &quot;never seen anything like that on a snooker table before&quot; and also rated Maguire as &quot;probably the best [player] in the world at the moment&quot;. Maguire met John Higgins in the final, but lost 6–9.

===2004–2009: UK Championship winner (2004) ===
At the 2004 UK Championship, Maguire defeated Mark King, Mark Davis, Stephen Lee, Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and Steve Davis en route to the final, where he defeated David Gray 10–1. Players praised the quality of play that Maguire had produced to win his first Triple Crown event. Davis described him as &quot;inspired&quot;, while O&#x27;Sullivan suggested that he could &quot;rule the game for the next ten years&quot;. In the first round of the 2005 World Championship, Maguire led O&#x27;Sullivan 9–7 but lost the match 9–10. At the end of the season he moved from 24th to 3rd in the world rankings.

During the 2005–06 snooker season, Maguire only reached one quarter-final, at the 2006 Malta Cup where he lost 4–5 against Ken Doherty. He won his first-round match at the 2006 World Championship, but lost to Marco Fu 4–13 in the second round. However, at the 2007 World Championship the following year, he defeated Joe Perry, Joe Swail and Anthony Hamilton to reach the semi-finals. He played John Higgins and led 14–10, but lost seven out of the next eight to lose 15–17.

Maguire won the ranking Northern Ireland Trophy in November 2007, defeating Fergal O&#x27;Brien 9–5 in the final. His second Triple Crown final came at the 2007 UK Championship. He defeated Joe Swail, Ian McCulloch, Mark Williams and Shaun Murphy to reach the final, where he was defeated by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 10–2. At the 2008 China Open, Maguire compiled his second maximum break against Ryan Day in the semi-finals. He won the match 6–5 and then beat Murphy in the final 10–9 on a to win the title. He reached the quarter-final stage of the 2008 World Championship, but lost in another final-frame decider (12–13) to Joe Perry. He ended the 2007–08 season ranked world number two. He retained this position going into the 2009–10 season, after reaching the semi-finals of both the Shanghai Masters and the UK Championship.

===2009–2012: PTC Champion (2011/12)===
Maguire began the 2009–10 season by winning the first event of the Pro Challenge Series, defeating Alan McManus 5–2 in the final. He followed this by reaching the semi-finals at the UK Championship by defeating Michael Holt 9–6 in the first round, Stuart Bingham 9–3 in the second round, and Peter Lines 9–5 in the quarter-finals, before losing to Ding Junhui 5–9. At the invitational Masters event in January, he beat Mark King 6–3 in the first round and Ryan Day 6–1 in the quarter-finals, but lost 3–6 in the semi-finals against Mark Selby. He also reached the semi-final stage at the Welsh Open, beating Dominic Dale 5–4 in the first round, Barry Hawkins 5–1 in the second round, and Mark Williams 5–1 in the quarter-finals, but he lost 3–6 against defending champion Ali Carter. Maguire made a poor start to the 2011–12 season, with first-round exits at the opening two ranking events of the year, the Australian Goldfields Open and the Shanghai Masters. He defeated Stephen Hendry and John Higgins at the UK Championship to set up a quarter-final with world number seven Judd Trump, but lost the match 3–6. He made three century breaks during the tournament, including a 144, which was the highest of the event.
In January 2012, Maguire won his first tournament carrying ranking points for almost four years, at PTC Event 12 in Germany. After beating Joe Perry 4–2 in the final, he stated that he had not practised at all over the Christmas period. The result meant that he finished eighth in the Order of Merit and qualified for the 2012 Finals. He exited the Masters in the first round for the second successive year following a 4–6 defeat to Mark Williams. He reached the final of the 2012 German Masters, whitewashing both Higgins and Murphy en route. He lost the final 7–9 against O&#x27;Sullivan, despite making three consecutive century breaks. At the PTC Finals, Maguire was whitewashed 0–4 in the semi-finals by Neil Robertson.&lt;ref name=&quot;11/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After a quarter-final run in the Welsh Open and a first-round defeat in the World Open, Maguire competed in the China Open. He had wins over O&#x27;Sullivan and Stephen Lee on his way to the final, where he played Peter Ebdon. Maguire trailed 1–5 before winning seven of the next ten frames to level the match at 8–8, forcing a deciding frame which Ebdon won. At the 2012 World Championship, Maguire defeated Luca Brecel 10–5 in the first round, Joe Perry 13–7 in the second, and Stephen Hendry 13–2 in the quarter-finals with a . He unwittingly became Hendry&#x27;s last opponent, as the seven-time world champion retired immediately after the match. Maguire lost his semi-final 12–17 to Ali Carter, and finished the season ranked world number four, meaning he had climbed four places during the year.

===2012–2015: Welsh Open Champion (2013)===
Maguire lost in the first round of the opening ranking event of the new season with a 4–5 defeat to Rod Lawler at the Wuxi Classic and then could not advance out of his group in the Six-red World Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His results soon picked up, as he won the second PTC title of his career at the UK PTC Event 1 by beating Jack Lisowski 4–3 in the final. He stated after the win that he was going to put a greater emphasis on his play this season. Maguire&#x27;s form continued as he reached his second consecutive PTC Event final, but this time he lost 3–4 to Martin Gould. He then lost in the second round of three consecutive ranking events and the first round of both the Masters and the German Masters.

In February 2013, Maguire won his first ranking event title in over five years at the Welsh Open. He defeated Anthony Hamilton, Matthew Stevens, Alan McManus and Judd Trump to face Stuart Bingham in the final. He came back from 5–7 down and eventually won the match with a composed 82 break in the deciding frame to triumph 9–8. He lost 4–5 to Ricky Walden in the second round of the World Open and, despite finishing third on the PTC Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals, was beaten 3–4 by Joe Swail in the first round. Maguire cruised into the semi-finals of the China Open by seeing off Michael Holt 5–3 and Barry Hawkins and Bingham both 5–1. He played Neil Robertson and led 4–2, but went on to lose 5–6. He faced world number 67 Dechawat Poomjaeng in the opening round of the 2013 World Championship and became part of &quot;one of the biggest shocks&quot; in the recent history of the tournament as he lost 9–10 to the &quot;charismatic Thai&quot; player.

Maguire&#x27;s first ranking event of the 2013–14 season was the Shanghai Masters, where he was defeated 2–5 by Xiao Guodong in the opening round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the semi-finals of the inaugural Indian Open and fought back from 0–3 down against home favourite Aditya Mehta to level at 3–3 but lost the deciding frame. At the UK Championship, Maguire came back from 2–5 down against Luca Brecel in the second round to win 6–5 and also edged past Liang Wenbo 6–5, before beating John Higgins 6–3. He lost 2–6 to Neil Robertson in the quarter-finals, with the Australian criticising the playing condition of the snooker table as &quot;absolute garbage&quot; after the match.

Maguire defeated both Joe Perry 6–4 and Robertson 6–2 at the Masters. He faced O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-finals but lost to the reigning world champion 6–2. He won three matches to reach the last 16 of the Welsh Open, but relinquished his title by losing 3–4 to 19-year-old Joel Walker. He then lost in the first round of the next two ranking events and withdrew from the China Open to enter the 2014 World Championship in poor form. Maguire produced a comeback from 3–6 and 6–9 down against Ryan Day to send the first-round match into a deciding frame but, despite having a chance to win, he lost 9–10. Afterwards, he described it as &quot;a season from hell for me&quot; and &quot;I just want to forget it&quot;. He ended the season as world number 14.

In June 2014, Maguire whitewashed Judd Trump 5–0 to reach the quarter-finals of the Wuxi Classic where he lost 4–5 against Martin Gould, despite making the tournament&#x27;s highest break of 145.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, he won the Six-red World Championship, defeating Ricky Walden 8–7 in the final. However, he failed to advance beyond the second round in the three major ranking events following Wuxi. After losing 1–4 to Trump in the opening round of the Champion of Champions, Maguire hinted at retiring from the game. When he came back from 0–3 down against Yu Delu to win 6–4 in the second round of the UK Championship, he remarked that he might seek the help of a sports psychologist in the future. He then beat Mark Williams 6–2, David Morris 6–3 and Marco Fu 6–4 to play in his first major ranking event semi-final in over a year. He again faced Trump and lost the first four frames, as well as being 1–5 behind. Maguire pulled the deficit back to a single frame and had chances to send the match into a deciding frame, but went when escaping a snooker on the colours and lost 4–6. A week later, Maguire continued his resurgence of form to win the inaugural Lisbon Open, defeating Matthew Selt 4–2 in the final. During the German Masters, he stated that he had regained his confidence and it would take &quot;something special to stop him&quot;. He needed two snookers in the deciding frame of his quarter-final match with Neil Robertson, which he managed after Robertson accidentally potted the black. In his second consecutive ranking event semi-final, Maguire was defeated 2–6 by Mark Selby. He advanced to the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open without facing a top-16 player, and lost 1–5 to John Higgins.

In 2015, Maguire qualified for the televised stages of the World Championship for a 12th straight year courtesy of Selby defeating Robert Milkins in the China Open, which kept Maguire in the top 16. In the opening round of the World Championship, he forced a deciding frame after having been 5–9 down to Anthony McGill, but then lost the decider. This was the fourth time in five seasons that Maguire had lost in the last 32 of the World Championship, and on each occasion he exited 9–10 having trailed and levelled the match. His end-of-season ranking of world number 15 was the lowest he had been in 11 years.

===2015–2018: Decline in form===
Maguire and teammate John Higgins lost in the final of the 2015 Snooker World Cup to Chinese teenagers Zhou Yuelong and Yan Bingtao. Maguire then reached the semi-finals of the first ranking event of the year by thrashing Judd Trump 5–1 at the Australian Goldfields Open, but he lost 1–6 to Martin Gould. He began his fourth-round match against Neil Robertson with a 118 break, but it was the only frame he could win in a 1–6 defeat. He was knocked out in the quarter-finals of the German Masters 1–5 by Graeme Dott and the first round of both the Welsh Open (3–4 to Martin O&#x27;Donnell) and the World Grand Prix (0–4 to Higgins). He failed to qualify for the PTC Finals after finishing 42nd on the European Order of Merit. This meant that Maguire needed a strong run at the China Open to avoid having to qualify for the 2016 World Championship at the end of the season. He achieved this with four wins to the China Cup semi-finals, but he was then whitewashed 6–0 by Trump. Despite his automatic qualification for the World Championship, Maguire stated that he felt embarrassed at being unable to motivate himself for the event, after losing 7–10 to Alan McManus in the first round. His 18th-place campaign was the first time that Maguire finished outside of the top 16 since 2004.

Maguire beat Barry Hawkins to make the quarter-finals of the Indian Open where he lost 1–4 to Anthony McGill. He made a 147 and two other centuries in his 5–0 wildcard win over Xu Yichen at the Shanghai Masters. He then whitewashed Shaun Murphy 5–0 and defeated Hawkins 5–3 and Michael White 5–1 to reach the semi-finals, where he lost 3–6 to Ding Junhui. He lost 3–6 to Luca Brecel in the fourth round of the UK Championship and was then defeated 1–5 against Mark Selby in the quarter-finals of the China Open. Maguire was unable to break back into the top 16 during the season and so needed to win three matches to qualify for the 2017 World Championship. Victories followed over Kritsanut Lertsattayathorn, Nigel Bond and Li Hang and he faced McGill in the opening round. From 2–2, Maguire scored 447 points without reply and went on to triumph 10–2 in his first match win at the Crucible since 2012. He then thrashed Rory McLeod 13–3 with a session to spare to reach the quarter-finals and came from 1–5 down to draw level with Barry Hawkins at 6–6. However, from 9–9 Maguire lost four frames in a row to be beaten 9–13.

Maguire&#x27;s form continued to improve in the 2017–18 season. He reached the final of the Riga Masters in June, but lost 2–5 to Ryan Day. In December, with wins over Yuan Sijun, Jak Jones, Liang Wenbo, Graeme Dott, and Joe Perry, Maguire advanced to the semi-finals of the UK Championship again, but was defeated 4–6 by the eventual champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Shortly after the UK Championship, he reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Open but lost 2–5 against Judd Trump. In February, Maguire progressed to the semi-finals of another ranking event, this time at the World Grand Prix, but lost 4–6 to O&#x27;Sullivan despite leading 4–2. He qualified for the 2018 World Championship after beating Allan Taylor, Hammad Miah, and Hossein Vafaei, and faced Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round. Despite leading 4–0 and 6–3, Maguire lost seven of the next eight frames in the second session and eventually lost 7–10.

=== 2018–present: Tour Championship winner (2020) ===
Maguire made a strong start to the 2018–19 season; with wins against Joe Perry and Kyren Wilson, he reached the semi-finals of the Riga Masters but lost 1–5 to Jack Lisowski. In October, he advanced to the semi-finals of another ranking event, the English Open, but this time lost 3–6 to Stuart Bingham. He performed fairly well at the UK Championship where he progressed to the quarter-finals, but was beaten 1–6 by Mark Allen. After strong performances over the past two seasons, Maguire returned to the Masters for the first time since 2015; however, he was outscored 712–190 by his opponent Mark Selby and lost 2–6. He reached his third semi-final of the season at the German Masters in February, but was defeated by Kyren Wilson 6–1. At the 2019 World Championship, Maguire won both of his first two rounds against Tian Pengfei and James Cahill, the latter ending in a final-frame decider, but was unable to replicate the same feat against Judd Trump in the quarter-finals, losing 6–13.

In September 2019, Maguire won the Six-red World Championship for the second time, after beating his fellow countryman John Higgins 8–6 in the final. In December, he reached the final of the UK Championship for the third time, his first appearance in the final since 2007. Despite losing the first four frames to his opponent, Ding Junhui, Maguire managed to recover to 3–5 at the end of the first session. In the second session, after making back-to-back centuries, he was only 6–8 behind but lost two more frames and the match 6–10. The highlight of the extended 2019–20 season for Maguire was the Tour Championship in June, where he beat Mark Allen 10–6 in the final, to secure the £150,000 winner&#x27;s prize and his first ranking event title since 2013. At the 2020 World Championship, he was defeated 3–10 by Martin Gould. Maguire began 2021 with a win over Mark Selby at the Masters, before a 5–6 loss to eventual champion Yan Bingtao.

At the 2022 Masters, Maguire was beaten in the first round by Mark Selby 36.
At the 2022 World Championship, Maguire beat rival Shaun Murphy in the first round 108. He went on to reach the quarter-final where he lost heavily to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 513.

At the 2024 World Championship, Maguire beat Ali Carter 107 in the first round and Shaun Murphy 139 in the last 16. In the quarter-final he lost 813 to David Gilbert.

==Rivalry==
Maguire has a professional rivalry with Shaun Murphy. In a match at the 2004 Grand Prix, Murphy was involved in one of Maguire&#x27;s frames being forfeited. As the match was about to begin, Maguire realised he had forgotten to bring his chalk with him so he asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena. Murphy spoke to the referee while Maguire was away; the tournament director Mike Ganley was summoned, and he docked Maguire a frame for not being ready to start at the scheduled time. Maguire later won the match 5–2.

A few weeks later, while playing in the final of the 2004 UK Championship, David Gray forgot to bring his chalk into the arena. However, Maguire allowed Gray to retrieve it without a frame being docked. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said, &quot;That put the icing on the cake, but we&#x27;ve always had a rivalry. I dislike him and I think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I&#x27;d lost to him.&quot;

==Personal life==
Maguire has three children with his wife Sharon. Unlike fellow professionals, he is permitted to play with his collar open and not wear a bow tie in competition because of a neck condition. Maguire was formally detained by Strathclyde Police on 27 August 2009, following allegations that he and countryman Jamie Burnett had colluded to produce a 9–3 victory for Maguire at their clash in the 2008 UK Championship; they were both released without charge.

<text>A cyclorama is a panoramic image on the inside of a cylindrical platform, designed to give viewers standing in the middle of the cylinder a 360° view, and also a building designed to show a panoramic image. The intended effect is to make viewers, surrounded by the panoramic image, feel as if they were standing in the midst of the place depicted in the image.

==Background==

Panoramas were invented by Irish painter Robert Barker, who wanted to find a way to capture the panoramic view from Calton Hill in central Edinburgh, Scotland. He subsequently opened his first cyclorama building in Edinburgh in 1787.

Cycloramas were very popular in the late 19th century. The most popular traveled from city to city to provide local entertainment – much like a modern movie. As the viewers stood in the center of the painting, there would often be music and a narrator telling the story of the event depicted. Sometimes dioramas were constructed in the foreground to provide additional realism to the cyclorama. Most major cities had one; circular and hexagonal-shaped buildings were constructed in almost every major US and European city to provide a viewing space for the cycloramas. For example, a 360° depiction of the land and naval battles of Vicksburg was completed and first exhibited in Paris. This work by Lucien-Pierre Sergent and Joseph Bertrand traveled to New York, Chicago and San Francisco and Tokyo. In 1885 the Philadelphia Panorama Company installed the &quot;Battle of Chattanooga&quot; in two units in Kansas City and Philadelphia, it was painted by Eugen Bracht. In 1892 a cyclorama was made of the 1876 &quot;Battle of Little Bighorn.&quot; Buffalo, New York has a surviving cyclorama building from 1888 that has long since been converted to use as private offices.
Hundreds of cycloramas were produced; however, only about thirty survive.

An extension of this concept into motion pictures was pioneered with the invention of the Cinéorama that debuted at the 1900 Paris Exposition. This evolved into such formats as IMAX and Circle-Vision 360°.

==&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; dramatisation ==
The main action centerpiece of the 1899 play &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was the use of a live chariot race using real horses and real chariots set against a cyclorama. &quot;The Era&#x27;s&quot; drama critic detailed how it was achieved by &quot;four great cradles, 20ft in length and 14ft wide, which are movable back and front on railways&quot;. The horses galloped full-pelt towards the audience, secured by invisible steel cable traces and running on treadmills. Electric rubber rollers spun the chariot wheels. A vast cyclorama backdrop revolved in the opposite direction to create an illusion of massive speed, and fans created clouds of dust. The critic for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; described it as &quot;a marvel of stage-illusion&quot; that was &quot;memorable beyond all else&quot;. &quot;The Sketch&#x27;s&quot; critic called it &quot;thrilling and realistic ... enough to make the fortune of any play&quot; and noted that &quot;the stage, which has to bear 30 tons&#x27; weight of chariots and horses, besides huge crowds, has had to be expressly strengthened and shored up&quot;. It went on to inspire the multi-Oscar-winning 1959 film adaptation of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, starring Charlton Heston – featuring the key live chariot race.

<text>Kirstine Bjerrum Meyer (12 October 1861 – 28 September 1941) was a Danish physicist and was the first woman from her country to earn a doctorate in natural sciences.

==Biography==
Kirstine Bjerrum was born in Skærbæk, Denmark and died in Hellerup. She was the daughter of Niels Janniksen Bjerrum (1826-1880) and Christiane Degn (1826-1877).

She moved to Copenhagen at the age of 18, where she lived with her elder brother, ophthalmologist Jannik Petersen Bjerrum (1851–1920). In 1885, she married mathematician Adolph Constantin Meyer (1854-1896) and took his surname. Following the death of her husband in 1896, she became the sole parent of the couple&#x27;s young son Johannes. 

In 1882, Kirstine Meyer had taken a teacher&#x27;s degree from N. Zahles Skole. In 1885, she began her studies at the University of Copenhagen. In 1893, she graduated with a Master&#x27;s Degree in physics. She was associated with the school from 1885 to 1909 and then continued as a censor at N. Zahles Skole for a number of years. From 1892-93 she was also a substitute at the boys&#x27; school Metropolitanskolen.

She was a high school teacher for many years, working on her education and research in physics at the same time. She won the Gold Medal of the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters in 1899, for a paper examining whether there exists a general equation of state for all fluid bodies, &quot;Om overensstemmende Tilstande hos Stofferne&quot;. She received her Ph.D. in physics from the University of Copenhagen in 1909, becoming the first Danish woman to earn a doctorate in natural sciences. Her dissertation, &quot;Temperaturbegrebets Udvikling gennem Tiderne&quot; (The Development of the Temperature Concept through Time), was an in-depth treatment of the history of the concept of temperature.

In 1902, Meyer founded &quot;Fysisk Tidsskrift&quot;, the Danish journal of physics. She was its editor until 1913. In 1925, she was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat travel scholarship.

<text>The bomba, or bomba kryptologiczna (Polish for &quot;bomb&quot; or &quot;cryptologic bomb&quot;), was a special-purpose machine designed around October 1938 by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski to break German Enigma-machine ciphers.

==Etymology==
How the machine came to be called a &quot;bomb&quot; has been an object of fascination and speculation. One theory, most likely apocryphal, originated with Polish engineer and army officer Tadeusz Lisicki (who knew Rejewski and his colleague Henryk Zygalski in wartime Britain but was never associated with the Cipher Bureau). He claimed that Jerzy Różycki (the youngest of the three Enigma cryptologists, and who had died in a Mediterranean passenger-ship sinking in January 1942) named the &quot;bomb&quot; after an ice-cream dessert of that name. This story seems implausible, since Lisicki had not known Różycki. 

Rejewski himself stated that the device had been dubbed a &quot;bomb&quot; &quot;for lack of a better idea&quot;. 

Perhaps the most credible explanation is given by a Cipher Bureau technician, Czesław Betlewski: workers at B.S.-4, the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s German section, christened the machine a &quot;bomb&quot; (also, alternatively, a &quot;washing machine&quot; or a &quot;mangle&quot;) because of the characteristic muffled noise that it produced when operating.

A top-secret U.S. Army report dated 15 June 1945 stated: 

The U.S. Army&#x27;s above description of the Polish &quot;bomba&quot; is both vague and inaccurate, as is clear from the device&#x27;s description at the end of the second paragraph of the &quot;History&quot; section, below: &quot;Each bomb... essentially constituted an &quot;electrically powered&quot; aggregate of &quot;six&quot; Enigmas...&quot; Determination of a solution involved no disassembly (&quot;a part... fall[ing] off&quot;) of the device.

==Background==
The German Enigma used a combination key to control the operation of the machine: rotor order, which rotors to install, which ring setting for each rotor, which initial setting for each rotor, and the settings of the &quot;stecker&quot; plugboard. The rotor settings were trigrams (for example, &quot;NJR&quot;) to indicate the way the operator was to set the machine. German Enigma operators were issued lists of these keys, one key for each day. For added security, however, each individual message was encrypted using an additional key modification. The operator randomly selected a trigram rotor setting for each message (for example, &quot;PDN&quot;). This message key would be typed twice (&quot;PDNPDN&quot;) and encrypted, using the daily key (all the rest of those settings). At this point each operator would reset his machine to the message key, which would then be used for the rest of the message. Because the configuration of the Enigma&#x27;s rotor set changed with each depression of a key, the repetition would not be obvious in the ciphertext since the same plaintext letters would encrypt to different ciphertext letters. (For example, &quot;PDNPDN&quot; might become &quot;ZRSJVL.&quot;)

This procedure, which seemed reasonably secure to the Germans, was nonetheless a cryptographic malpractice, since the first insights into Enigma encryption could be inferred from seeing how the same character string was encrypted differently two times in a row.

==History==

Using the knowledge that the first three letters of a message were the same as the second three, Polish mathematician–cryptologist Marian Rejewski was able to determine the internal wiring of the Enigma machine and thus to reconstruct the logical structure of the device. Only general traits of the machine were suspected, from the example of the commercial Enigma variant, which the Germans were known to have been using for diplomatic communications. The military versions were sufficiently different to present an entirely new problem. Having done that much, it was still necessary to check each of the potential daily keys to break an encrypted message (i.e., a &quot;ciphertext&quot;). With many thousands of such possible keys, and with the growing complexity of the Enigma machine and its keying procedures, this was becoming an increasingly daunting task.

In order to mechanize and speed up the process, Rejewski, a civilian mathematician working at the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau in Warsaw, invented the &quot;bomba kryptologiczna&quot; (cryptologic bomb), probably in October 1938. Each bomb (six were built in Warsaw for the Cipher Bureau before September 1939) essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas and took the place of some one hundred workers. 

The bomb method was based, like the Poles&#x27; earlier &quot;grill&quot; method, on the fact that the plug connections in the commutator (&quot;plugboard&quot;) did not change all the letters. But while the grill method required unchanged &quot;pairs&quot; of letters, the bomb method required only unchanged letters. Hence it could be applied even though the number of plug connections in this period was between five and eight. In mid-November 1938, the bombs were ready, and the reconstructing of daily keys now took about two hours.

Up to July 25, 1939, the Poles had been breaking Enigma messages for over six and a half years without telling their French and British allies. On December 15, 1938, two new rotors, IV and V, were introduced (three of the now five rotors being selected for use in the machine at a time). As Rejewski wrote in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of &quot;British Intelligence in the Second World War&quot;, &quot;we quickly found the [wirings] within the [new rotors], but [their] introduction [...] raised the number of possible sequences of drums from 6 to 60 [...] and hence also raised tenfold the work of finding the keys. Thus the change was not qualitative but quantitative. We would have had to markedly increase the personnel to operate the bombs, to produce the perforated sheets (60 series of 26 sheets each were now needed, whereas up to the meeting on July 25, 1939, we had only two such series ready) and to manipulate the sheets.&quot;

Harry Hinsley suggested in &quot;British Intelligence in the Second World War&quot; that the Poles decided to share their Enigma-breaking techniques and equipment with the French and British in July 1939 because they had encountered insuperable technical difficulties. Rejewski rejected this: &quot;No, it was not [cryptologic] difficulties [...] that prompted us to work with the British and French, but only the deteriorating political situation. If we had had no difficulties at all we would still, or even the more so, have shared our achievements with our allies as our contribution to the struggle against Germany.&quot;

<text>Hassan Gouled Aptidon (; ; October 15, 1916 – November 21, 2006) was the first President of Djibouti from 1977 to 1999.

==Biography==
He was born in the small village of Gerisa in the Lughaya district in British Somaliland. He was born into the politically powerful Mamassan subset of the Issa clan. He played an important role in Djibouti&#x27;s struggle for independence from France. Hassan Gouled began his career in the 1930s as a nurse. He was stationed in Dikhil in 1932. He was then an entrepreneur. In 1946, he founded with Mahamoud Harbi Farah the Somali and Dankali Youth Club. They were elected together in 1951 to the Representative Council of the colony, then separated. Hassan Gouled was elected French senator, against Mahmoud Harbi. He remained so from 1952 to 1957. Hassan Gouled campaigned against Mahamoud Harbi Farah of the &quot;Union Republicaine&quot; party, who sought to join the territory with neighboring Somalia. By the time of the 23 November 1958 elections, Mahamoud Harbi&#x27;s party had disintegrated and with the majority of the Afar vote, his faction won election. Mahamoud Harbi subsequently fled Djibouti, and later died in a plane crash.

Hassan Gouled served as vice-president of the Government Council from 1958 to April 1959. Hassan Gouled also served in the French National Assembly 1959-1962 and the French Senate 1952–1958. He was defeated in parliamentary elections in 1962 by Moussa Ahmed Idriss of the Party of Popular Movement (PMP). In the 1960s, he led the Democratic Union Issa. It is a signatory to the agreement of Arta in September 1963. He was then education minister in a government led by Ali Aref Bourhan from 1963 to 1967. He was briefly jailed in July 1967, along with other officials of the PMP (which he had joined in 1965). He was elected to the Territorial Assembly in November 1968 and later became Minister of the Interior. Later he served as the first Prime Minister of Djibouti between May 1977 and July 1977.

==Towards independence==
In 1974, Hassan Gouled called a vote with the support of François Mitterrand. He became president of the African People&#x27;s League for Independence (LPAI) created in February 1975 by the merger of the African People&#x27;s Union (UPA) and the League for the Future and Order. The General Secretary was Ahmed Dini.

He became President of the Governing Council on 18 May 1977 and was elected President of the future Republic of Djibouti on 28 May by the Chamber of Deputies. It remained so until 1999. After the attack on the &quot;Zinc Palm&quot; in December 1977, it banned the main opposition party, the MPL, and established a one-party system.

==Presidency==
In 1981, Hassan Gouled turned the country into a one party state by declaring that his party, the People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (&quot;Rassemblement populaire pour le progrès&quot;, RPP), was the sole legal one. As the RPP candidate, he was elected without opposition for a six-year term as president on 12 June 1981, receiving 84.58% of the vote. After the start of the Djiboutian Civil War in 1991, he allowed for a constitutional referendum on multiparty politics in September 1992, with four parties being permitted. In the parliamentary elections held in December 1992, only two parties competed, and the RPP won all 65 seats in the National Assembly. Gouled was reelected for a fourth term in May 1993 with 60.7% of the vote.

In the 1990s, the Djibouti economy deteriorated dramatically, with net external assets falling by 40 per cent. The World Bank issued &quot;a correspondingly gloomy and highly critical&quot; assessment, mentioning such social problems as the excessive consumption of the addictive and debilitating drug &quot;qat&quot; by Djibouti&#x27;s citizens. During this period, Hassan Gouled&#x27;s nephew Ismaïl Omar Guelleh not only maneuvered to be his successor, but increasingly came to handle affairs for the elderly Hassan Gouled.

On 4 February 1999, Gouled Aptidon announced that he would retire at the time of the next election, and an extraordinary congress of the RPP, the party chose Guelleh as its presidential candidate. Guelleh won the presidential election held in April 1999 and succeeded his uncle on 8 May 1999. Gouled Aptidon died at his home on 21 November 2006, aged 90.

Gouled&#x27;s first wife, former First Lady Aicha Bogoreh, a proponent of women&#x27;s rights and various charities, died in 2001. He married his second wife after Bogoreh&#x27;s death.

<text>Horace Lindrum (born Horace Norman William Morrell, 15 January 1912 – 20 June 1974) was an Australian professional player of snooker and English billiards. Lindrum won the 1952 World Snooker Championship defeating New Zealander Clark McConachy. The tournament is disputed, as it had only two participants, and other players boycotted the event to play in the 1952 World Professional Match-play Championship. Lindrum won the Australian Professional Billiards Championship on multiple occasions, first winning the event in 1934.

Lindrum lived in Britain for long periods and played in the major British tournaments. From his arrival in Britain in 1935, he was regarded as the second-best player in the world, behind Joe Davis. Lindrum contested three World Snooker Championship finals against Davis, in 1936, 1937 and 1946, losing all three to Davis but coming close to beating him on several occasions.

==Career==
===Early years===
Lindrum was born Horace Norman William Morrell on 15 January 1912 in Sydney. He was the son of Clara, who was an Australian women&#x27;s snooker champion in her own right. Her brother was Walter Lindrum.

Lindrum made his first century break in snooker at the age of 16 and his first four-figure break in billiards at the age of 18. He challenged Frank Smith for the Australian Professional Snooker Championship and, on 5 December 1931, at the age of 19, won by an aggregate score of 8899–8262. Lindrum accepted a challenge from Smith for a rematch and won convincingly, 8060–5942. Three years later, on 24 November 1934, he also won the Australian Professional Billiards Championship, successfully challenging his uncle Fred who had held the title since 1908. Lindrum won by 18,754–9,143.

===Unofficial World Championship 1934===
In June 1934, four-time World Billiards Championship winner Joe Davis traveled to Australia to play at the 1934 championship. Davis played Walter Lindrum, the defending champion, in Melbourne, from 14 to 27 October. Walter Lindrum won a close match 23,553–22,678. Davis was scheduled to depart Australia on 30 October but accepted an invitation to play against Horace Lindrum at snooker, delaying his departure until 7 November. An 81-frame match was scheduled at the Tivoli Billiard Theatre, Bourke Street, in Melbourne from 29 October to 6 November with two sessions of five frames played each day. Davis insisted on using the same table from the World Billiards Championship final. The match was described as the unofficial World Championship final.

Lindrum won the first two frames of the match, but Davis led 6–4 at the end of the first day. Davis made a break of 56 in the fifth frame. Davis extended his lead to 12–8 on the second day and then won eight frames on the third day to lead 20–10. Davis made breaks of 56 and 54 on the third day. Davis extended his lead to 27–13 on the fourth day but Lindrum won six frames on the fifth day to leave Davis 31–19 ahead. On Saturday, the sixth day, Davis won 8 frames to lead 39–21, including a 50 break. Davis won two frames on Monday afternoon to take a 1–2 lead. With the result decided, the match became more open, as Lindrum had breaks of 54 and 80, the highest of the match. The final Tuesday afternoon session was abandoned, because it clashed with the Melbourne Cup. After a final evening session of five frames, Davis finished 46–29 ahead. Fred Lindrum criticised Davis for demanding a £100 side bet and for insisting on the use of the match table on which he had recently played.

===Trips to England 1935–1947===
Lindrum arrived in England in October 1935 and stayed until his return to Australia at the end of March 1939, only returning to Australia for a brief period in the middle of 1937. After his arrival, Lindrum played a week-long billiards match against Tom Newman at Thurston&#x27;s Hall. Given a handicap of 2,000, he won 8,348 to 7,883. Lindrum then played Joe Davis in a billiards match, which had two frames of snooker played at the end of each session. Davis gave a 3,000 start but still won 10,348 to 9,847, although Lindrum won the snooker, 14–10. In December, Lindrum played two snooker-only best-of-61 matches against Joe Davis over successive weeks at Thurston&#x27;s Hall. Lindrum received a seven-point start in each frame. Lindrum won the first match, 31–30, while Davis won the second, 32–29. Davis won the side stakes for the overall aggregate score and for the highest break of 104, scored on the final evening, the only century break in the two matches.

The early part of 1936 was taken up with the 1935/1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup. This was a handicap billiards event, with Lindrum handicapped in the middle of the 7 competitors, receiving points from 3 and giving them to the other 3. Lindrum won three of his six matches. The Gold Cup was immediately followed by the World Snooker Championship. Lindrum met Bert Terry in the first round, Clare O&#x27;Donnell in the quarter-final, and Stanley Newman in the semi-final, winning all his matches comfortably. In the final, Lindrum met defending champion Joe Davis. Lindrum led 6–4 and 11–9, before Davis won four out of the next five frames with top breaks of 75 and 78 to lead 13–12. However, Lindrum levelled the match at 15–15, before winning six out of ten frames to lead 21–19, and led at the conclusion of the penultimate day 26–24. He then won the first frame of the final day, to lead 27–24, before Davis won the last ten frames in a row to win 34–27, having already won the match 31–27.

The 1936 Daily Mail Gold Cup was played as a snooker competition, reflecting snooker&#x27;s growing importance. It was a handicap event, with Joe Davis handicapped as the best player. Lindrum received a 7-point start in each frame from Davis but had to give starts ranging from 7 to 28 to the other four competitors. Lindrum was second in the event behind Davis, winning three of five matches. His defeats were by 35–36 to Sidney Smith, giving Smith a 7-point start, and by 30–41 in the final match of the tournament to Davis. The main part of the 1937 World Snooker Championship did not start until late February, and the early part of 1937 was mostly taken up with snooker exhibition matches between Lindrum and Davis, with Lindrum always receiving a 7-point start in each frame. There were four matches played over a total of 30 days, and, with 12 frames per frame being played, they played some 360 frames against each other in the period. Lindrum won the first match in Manchester, 39–36, a match that included a break of 141 by Lindrum. The following week, in Coventry, Davis won 39–32. Lindrum then won 74–69 in a two-week match at Thurston&#x27;s Hall.

Lindrum returned to London to compete in the 1937 World Snooker Championship. He won his quarterfinal against Sydney Lee and his semi-final against Willie Smith comfortably, and met Joe Davis again in the final. The first day was level at 5–5 but Lindrum led 11–9 and extended this to 17–13 at the half-way stage. The fourth day started with a break of 103 by Davis in frame 31. Davis fouled on his first visit to the table, and, after a break of 29 by Lindrum, Davis cleared the table on his second visit. Davis reduced the deficit to 21–19 on the fourth day and then won eight frames on the fifth day to lead 27–23. After the final afternoon session, Davis still led 29–26, with Lindrum needing to win five of the six evening frames. Lindrum won the first two, but Davis won the next two to win the match 31–28. The last two frames were shared to give a final result of 32–29. His match against Smith was spotlighted by the BBC in a 10-minute segment before they broadcast snooker.

Lindrum returned to Australia in the middle of 1937, playing a series of exhibition matches with Melbourne Inman. He returned to England in time to play in the Daily Mail Gold Cup. He was again ranked as the second-best player, receiving 10 points per frame from Joe Davis and conceding points to the other competitors. Lindrum lost his first two matches, won the next three, and lost to Davis 37–34 in the final match. He finished third in the final table. Lindrum did not enter the 1938 World Snooker Championship because he objected to certain conditions, particularly the cloth used. However, he played a two-week exhibition match against Davis, the new champion, at Thurston&#x27;s Hall immediately after the championship. Lindrum received 10 points in each frame, but Davis won 71–62. He ended the season by beating Fred Davis 39–34, despite conceding 14 points per frame.

Lindrum started the 1938/39 season playing a couple of exhibition matches against Joe Davis, Davis conceding 10 points per frame. Davis won both matches, 39–32 in Edinburgh and 37–34 in Newcastle upon Tyne. In the Daily Mail Gold Cup, Lindrum was again handicapped as the second strongest player but now received 20 points per frame from Joe Davis. The tournament was a disappointment for Lindrum, who lost his first four matches before beating Davis 36–35 in the final match.
Lindrum played in the 1939 World Snooker Championship, but he lost his first match 14–17 to Alec Brown. Lindrum ended his disappointing season by playing Joe Davis in an exhibition match. Davis conceded 21 points per frame but still won 39–34. Lindrum returned to Australia, arriving in late August. During this time, Lindrum made an unofficial maximum break in New South Wales, the first to be made in competitive play. Lindrum planned to return to England later in the year, but because of World War II he did not return until August 1945. At the 1946 World Snooker Championship Lindrum won his quarterfinal match against Herbert Holt and beat Fred Davis in the semi-final to meet Joe Davis in the final for the third time.

Lindrum played in the World Championship in 1947 and 1951 where he lost to Walter Donaldson in the semi-final on both occasions. During a trip to India in 1952, Lindrum made the first century break in the country.

===1952 World Professional Snooker Championship===
The 1952 World Snooker Championship had only two entries, Lindrum and Clark McConachy, following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players&#x27; Association (PBPA) and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC). The BACC thought the championship was primarily about honour, and insisted that financial consideration should come second. With Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson sharing only £500 for the previous year&#x27;s final, the PBPA boycotted and established an alternative world championship called the 1952 World Professional Match-play Championship. Lindrum was the only active professional to take part in the BACC event.

Lindrum won the 145-frame match comfortably, taking a 73–37 lead early on the 10th day. The remaining 35 &quot;dead&quot; frames were due to be played, although in the end only a total of 143 frames were played, with Lindrum winning 94–49. Snooker journalist Clive Everton has called the match &quot;farcical&quot;, pointing out that most of the snooker public regarded the World Match-Play Championship as the real world championship.

Lindrum was the only Australian to win the championship until Neil Robertson at the 2010 event.

===Later years and death===
By 1957, Lindrum retired from competitive play to become an exhibition player, touring Australia and South Africa and describing himself as the &quot;undefeated world champion.&quot; In 1963, the Australian Professional Billiards and Snooker Association asked him to return to competitive play to combat the flagging interest in the sport in Australia. The president of the Australian Association, Dennis Robinson, described Lindrum&#x27;s return to competitive play as a &#x27;magnanimous gesture&#x27;, and the program published for the event contained &#x27;a tribute to Lindrum&#x27;. That year, Lindrum won the Australian Open.

Lindrum died on 20 June 1974 at the Delmar Private Hospital, Dee Why, Sydney, of a bronchial carcinoma. Joy, his wife, and their two daughters survived him.

<doc id="716712" wikidata="Q640692" url="?curid=716712" title="Eternal flame">
<text>An eternal flame is a flame, lamp or torch that burns for an indefinite time. Most eternal flames are ignited and tended intentionally, but some are natural phenomena caused by natural gas leaks, peat fires and coal seam fires, all of which can be initially ignited by lightning, piezoelectricity or human activity, some of which have burned for hundreds or thousands of years.

In ancient times, eternal flames were fueled by wood or olive oil; modern examples usually use a piped supply of propane or natural gas. Human-created eternal flames most often commemorate a person or event of national significance, serve as a symbol of an enduring nature such as a religious belief, or a reminder of commitment to a common goal, such as diplomacy.

==Religious and cultural significance==

The eternal fire is a long-standing tradition in many cultures and religions. In ancient Iran the &quot;atar&quot; was tended by a dedicated priest and represented the concept of &quot;divine sparks&quot; or &quot;Amesha Spenta,&quot; as understood in Zoroastrianism. Period sources indicate that three &quot;great fires&quot; existed in the Achaemenid era of Persian history, which are collectively considered the earliest reference to the practice of creating ever-burning community fires.

The eternal flame was a component of the Jewish religious rituals performed in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem, where a commandment required a fire to burn continuously upon the Outer Altar. Modern Judaism continues a similar tradition by having a sanctuary lamp, the &quot;ner tamid&quot;, always lit above the ark in the synagogue. After World War II, such flames gained further meaning, as a reminder of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. Judaism has a concept of a נר תמיד or everlasting flame. This is commonly found hanging in front of the Aron Kodesh (holy ark) in orthodox Synagogues. It is meant as a remembrance of the Temple. Occasionally this flame is a fire which is kept lit 24/7. Other times it is merely electric and stays on all the time.

In traditional Christian denominations, such as Catholicism and Lutheranism, a chancel lamp continuously burns as an indication of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

The Cherokee Nation maintained a fire at the seat of government until ousted by the Indian Removal Act in 1830. At that time, embers from the last great council fire were carried west to the nation&#x27;s new home in the Oklahoma Territory. The flame, maintained in Oklahoma, was carried back to the last seat of the Cherokee government at Red Clay State Park in south-eastern Tennessee, to the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina, and to the Cherokee Nation Tribal Complex in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

In China, it has at times been common to establish an eternally lit lamp as a visible aspect of ancestor veneration; it is set in front of a spirit tablet on the family&#x27;s ancestral altar.

==Extinguished flames==
* Eternal fire at Nymphaion sanctuary in southern Illyria. Placed around the lower Vjosë/Aoos river near ancient Apollonia and present-day Selenica, Albania, the area was occupied by Illyrians since before archaic colonial times, and the site was likely already a place of worship because of its peculiar physical properties. According to ancient literary accounts the fire of the sanctuary never went out before an ancient war fought between Apollonia and the Illyrians.
* One of the three &quot;Great Flames&quot; of the Achaemenid Empire was extinguished during the reign of Alexander the Great to honour the death of his close friend Hephaestion in 324 BC.
* The Hebrew Bible commands that &quot;The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out&quot; (Leviticus 6:13, JPS), regarding the altar of Burnt Offering in the Tabernacle, and later the altars in Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Second Temple (the latter sacked by Rome in 70 AD). Many churches (especially Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran), along with Jewish synagogues, feature an eternal flame on or hung above their altars (churches) or Torah arks (synagogues). 
* The Sacred fire of Vesta in Ancient Rome, which burned within the Temple of Vesta on the Roman Forum, was extinguished in 394 AD.
*The sacred fire of the Celtic goddess Brigid burned at Kildare, Ireland in pagan times and the fire was continued when the site was Christianised by Saint Brigid in the 5th century AD. It continued burning until the 16th-century Dissolution of the Monasteries.
* The eternal flame near the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn in Estonia was extinguished after the country gained independence from the USSR in 1991.

* The eternal flame that was part of the East German &quot;Memorial to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism&quot; at the Neue Wache in East Berlin was removed after the 1990 German reunification. In 1993, the space was redesigned without a flame and rededicated as the &quot;Central Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany for the Victims of War and Tyranny&quot;.
*Llama de la Libertad lit by Augusto Pinochet in 1975 in to commemorate the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat against Salvador Allende. It was extinguished in 2004.
* A high Eternal flame monument was erected in Belgrade in 2000, to commemorate the victims of 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The flame was extinguished just months later, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević.
* A lighthouse-like memorial in the suburb of Eira in Helsinki, Finland was originally erected in honour of the Finnish seamen and seafaring. It later became a symbol of those who have perished at the sea, the Baltic Sea in particular. A minor controversy arose when the flame was temporarily extinguished, to conserve gas, technically meaning the flame was not an eternal one. It had been relit but in the middle 2010s, the city of Helsinki grew tired of having to relight the flame and decided to put it out for good.

<text>Driver is a video game series consisting of a mixture of action-adventure and driving in open world environments. It is developed by Reflections Interactive (now Ubisoft Reflections), and originally published by GT Interactive, later by Infogrames/Atari and then Ubisoft. Since the series began with &quot;Driver&quot; in 1999, there have been five main installments released of which the latest is &quot;&quot; in 2011, most of which are about a fictional police officer called John Tanner. As of August 2011, the series has sold more than 16 million units worldwide.

==Games==
===&quot;Driver&quot;===

The first game of the &quot;Driver&quot; series was released for the PlayStation on 25 June 1999 in Europe and 30 June in the U.S. It was later released in 2000 for Game Boy Color in April, Windows in September, Mac in December, and iOS in December 2009. In the game, the player controls a former racecar driver turned undercover police detective named John Tanner. It featured a storyline inspired by 1960s/70s car chase movies such as &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978) and based in four real-life cities; Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. It was the best selling game of the &quot;Driver&quot; series and an evolution of the freedom to explore a city as brought forth in the early &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games.

===&quot;Driver 2&quot;===

The second installment in the &quot;Driver&quot; series was released for the PlayStation on 13 November 2000 in the U.S. by Infogrames (now known as Atari), and later ported to the Game Boy Advance on 4 October 2002 in the U.S. It featured detective John Tanner once more, along with a new partner, detective Tobias Jones, in four more real-life cities (Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas, and Rio de Janeiro). It was the first game in the series to feature 2-player modes, curved roads, and the ability to get out of the car at any time (apart from while being in a pursuit from the police) in order to steal another car on the street.

The third installment in the &quot;Driver&quot; series was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on 21 June 2004 in the U.S. to generally mixed or poor reviews (despite new features such as the ability to use firearms). The game takes place in Miami, Nice and Istanbul. It was subsequently followed by versions for Windows, and Game Boy Advance.

===&quot;Driver: Parallel Lines&quot;===

The fourth game in the series, &quot;&quot;, was released 14 March 2006 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in the U.S., and 26 June 2007 for Windows and Wii in the U.S. Reflections intended &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; to &quot;return the series to its roots&quot; by focusing more on driving.

The game differs greatly in other aspects from its predecessors, though, as the story no longer follows undercover police officer Tanner and the game takes place in only one location, New York City. The new main player&#x27;s name is TK, a criminal rather than a cop. The game includes two time periods, 1978 and 2006, when the main player is sentenced to prison for 28 years and returns in 2006. The game received better reviews, but unlike &quot;Driver 3&quot;, did not sell particularly well.

===&quot;Driver 76&quot;===

&quot;Driver 76&quot; is a PlayStation Portable game in the &quot;Driver&quot; series. Set in New York City in 1976, two years before the events in the first half of &quot;&quot;, the player takes the role of Ray, TK&#x27;s friend and a supporting character from &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;. The game was developed by Sumo Digital and Reflections, and was the first &quot;Driver&quot; game published by Ubisoft after they acquired Reflections. It was released on 8 May 2007 in the U.S.

===&quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot;===

The fifth &quot;Driver&quot; game was long rumored to be in production. After several years of speculation, Ubisoft unveiled &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot; at E3 2010. After several delays, it was released in September 2011 along with &quot;Driver: Renegade 3D&quot;.

The game takes place in one location, San Francisco, and follows the series protagonist, Tanner, being in a coma after suffering an accident. Thus, the player controls Tanner during his coma dream. The plot of the Wii version of &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot; is completely different from the other versions, being a prequel to the events of the original &quot;Driver&quot;.

For the game, developers decided to remove the ability to get out of a car in order to steal another car on the street. Instead, they created a new mechanic called &quot;Shift&quot;, enabling the players to shift to any car at any time, aside from a few missions.

The game received generally positive reviews, getting the highest ratings in the whole series after &quot;Driver&quot;. Like &quot;Driver 3&quot;, it sold particularly well.

===&quot;Driver: Renegade 3D&quot;===

A Nintendo 3DS game, &quot;Driver: Renegade 3D&quot; follows John Tanner trying to take down the New York City crime mobs. It was released in September 2011 at the same time as &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot; and takes place between the events of &quot;Driver&quot; and &quot;Driver 2&quot;.

===&quot;Driver: Speedboat Paradise&quot;===
A free-to-play smartphone game was released on iOS and Android in December 2014. The game, which makes use of in-app purchases, revolves solely around missions on speedboats.

==Novels==
&quot;Driver: Nemesis&quot;, a novel written by Alex Sharp, was published in 2010 to coincide with the release of &quot;&quot;. The novel is a sequel to &quot;Driver 2&quot; and a prequel to the events of &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot;, taking place at some point before Hurricane Katrina. The story follows John Tanner&#x27;s undercover infiltration to a crime network in New Orleans. It features several characters from the first two games and provides additional backstory for Tanner&#x27;s life prior to becoming a member of law enforcement.

==Related games==
&quot;&quot; (released in 2006) and &quot;&quot; (released in 2007) are two mobile games featuring John Tanner. &quot;Vegas&quot; features his exploits in Las Vegas in an attempt to exact revenge on Charles Jericho after &quot;Driver 3&quot;, while &quot;L.A. Undercover&quot;, set two years later, features Tanner&#x27;s exploits in Los Angeles to take down the Los Angeles Mafia by working his way up the ladder.

===&quot;C.O.P. The Recruit&quot;===
Ubisoft released &quot;C.O.P. The Recruit&quot; for Nintendo DS on November 3, 2009. It was originally registered under numerous names, one of which being &quot;Driver: The Recruit&quot;.

===&quot;Watch Dogs&quot;===
Ubisoft Montreal had been working on its own sequel in the &quot;Driver&quot; series at the same time that Ubisoft Reflections had been developing &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot;. Ubisoft Montreal&#x27;s game had included some elements of hacking the driving environment to the player advantage, such as triggering street lights, as well as being able to swap from driver to driver. When &quot;Driver: San Francisco&quot; released in 2011, it did not do well commercially, leading to the &quot;Driver&quot; title in development at Ubisoft Montreal to have portions reworked into the first &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; game. Ubisoft Reflections subsequently helped Ubisoft Montreal in building out &quot;Watch Dogs&quot; for release, handling most of the driving portions of the game while Ubisoft Montreal handled the details related to on-foot missions and hacking. The game&#x27;s Disrupt engine was originally intended for this &quot;Driver&quot; game in development.

==Film and television adaptations==
In February 2002, Impact Pictures, the production team of Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt, had acquired the film and TV rights to adapt &quot;Driver&quot;. Screenwriters James DeMonaco, Todd Jason Harthan, and James Roday Rodriguez were developing a script at the time. Impact Pictures had originally intended to produce the film &quot;Driver&quot; to coincide with the release of the video game &quot;Driver 3&quot;. The following November, Impact Pictures announced its plans to produce a $50 million adaptation of &quot;Driver&quot; after wrapping up principal photography on &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. In April 2006, Rogue Pictures acquired the film rights to &quot;Driver&quot; from Impact Pictures and Constantin Films, the production companies responsible for the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film franchise. Roger Avary replaced the original screenwriters in writing the script for &quot;Driver&quot;, as well as directing the film.

Prior to January 2007, &quot;Driver&quot;, having a budget of $48 million, was slated to shoot at Cinespace Studios&#x27; MT28 lot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Due to a waterfront revitalization project, the studio was forced to move and the film was put on hold. In May 2009, the movie script was leaked on the internet.

On 14 September 2021, Ubisoft announced a live-action &quot;Driver&quot; series was coming to the new Binge streaming platform, to be produced by Allan Ungar, Vince Talenti and Ubisoft Film &amp; Television. It was cancelled shortly after.

<text>Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), previously known as the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) until 2004, is the governing body for the sport of cricket in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Cricket is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and administers the Zimbabwe national cricket team, organising Test tours, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket, including the Castle Logan Cup, the Coca-Cola Metbank Pro50 Championship and the Stanbic Bank 20 Series in Zimbabwe.

In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events, which put their participation in the 2019 ICC Women&#x27;s World Twenty20 Qualifier and the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournaments in doubt. Later the same month, the ICC wrote to Zimbabwe Cricket, instructing them to reinstate their board that was elected on 14 June 2019, or risk the termination of their ICC membership. In October 2019, the ICC lifted its suspension on Zimbabwe Cricket, allowing them to take part in future ICC events.

In December 2022, ZC announced a six-team T10 tournament which is set to launch in March 2023. It will be called Zim Afro T10. The tournament is the first ever franchise league of the board.

==History==

Zimbabwe cricket went through major upheaval during the 2000s. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, senior team members Andy Flower and Henry Olonga staged their &quot;black armband protest&quot; at the &quot;death of democracy&quot; in Zimbabwe, a reference to the country&#x27;s political situation. Both players subsequently retired from international cricket. In 2004, the majority of the remaining senior players quit the international game following a player protest triggered by the removal of then-captain Heath Streak, resulting in a very young and inexperienced side being fielded in subsequent series against Sri Lanka and Australia. Zimbabwe&#x27;s resounding defeats in those series led to the withdrawal of Test status that, apart from a brief resumption in 2005 with series against South Africa, New Zealand and India, remained in place until early 2011. Recent improvements in Zimbabwe&#x27;s on-field performances, including a notable victory over Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 group stages and an overhaul of coaching staff has, however, led to the side&#x27;s Test status being reinstated, with matches now planned against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand in late 2011.

In February 2017, Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed that an academy side would tour England later that year to play fixtures against second XI sides, including Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. The following players were selected for the squad: Ryan Burl, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Taffy Mupariwa, Tafadzwa Tsiga, Tarisai Musakanda, Tylor Trenoweth, William Mashinge, Faraz Akram, Carl Mumba, Blessing Muzarabani, Tendai Nyamayaro, Mkhululi Nyathi, Richard Ngarava, Kuziva Ziwira, Thamsanqa Nunu and Brandon Mavuta.

In September 2018, the former national team coach Heath Streak submitted an application to the court to have Zimbabwe Cricket liquidated, in relation to outstanding debts.

==Return to Test cricket==

As part of the lead-up to their Test return, Zimbabwe Cricket announced major upgrades to the Harare Sports Club and Mutare Sports Club grounds. Plans for a new Test ground at Victoria Falls were also revealed. ZC also signed a three-year deal with Reebok worth $1mn. The deal will see Reebok sponsor the Domestic competitions and provide the kits of the Zimbabwean national cricket team.

===Zimbabwe v. Bangladesh===

Zimbabwe played their first Test match, after regaining their Test status, against Bangladesh at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The only Test started on Thursday 4 August 2011. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field first. Zimbabwe won the Test on day five by 130 runs.

<text>Rosaura Andreu (1 January 1918 – 21 November 2010) was an actress born in El Paso, Texas to actress Cecilia Cavero. Andreu is best remembered in Puerto Rico for playing the character &quot;Titi Chagua&quot; in a local television show for children.

Cecilia Cavero moved with her children to Havana, where Rosaura Andreu met her first husband: the famous Cuban comedian Leopoldo Fernandez, nicknamed &quot;Tres Patines.&quot; 

Andreu first visited Puerto Rico as part of a Cuban theatrical troupe. Years later she settled on the island and joined the group La farandula bohemia. In the 1950s, Andreu was part of the early years of Puerto Rican television. She became known to the children television viewers in such programs as Romper Room con Berta and others. 

During the 1970s, she became widely famous when the Puerto Rican public television channel, WIPR-TV, started airing her program, &quot;El Show de Titi Chagua&quot; (&quot;Auntie Chagua&#x27;s Show&quot;). The show had tough competition, such as WRIK/WLUZ&#x27;s &quot;Sandra Zaiter show&quot;, WAPA-TV&#x27;s &quot;Cine Recreo con Pacheco&quot; (with Joaquin Monserrat as &quot;Pacheco&quot;) and WKAQ-TV&#x27;s &quot;El show del Tío Nobel&quot; (&quot;Uncle Nobel&#x27;s Show&quot;). The four main children&#x27;s shows in Puerto Rico at that era were shown at the same hour every weekday, to compete against each other as &quot;El Show de Tio Nobel&quot; also had Saturday and Sunday morning editions. However, her show stayed on the air until the middle 1980s, when WLUZ was sold and relaunched as WSTE in 1987. 

== Later life ==
She retired from show business to Orlando, Florida, where she died.

==Death==
Andreu died November 21, 2010, aged 92, at her Orlando home.

<text>Robert Sherwood Shankland (January 11, 1908 – March 1, 1982) was an American physicist and historian.

==Biography==

Robert S. Shankland was an undergraduate at the Case School for Applied Sciences from 1925–1929 and received his master&#x27;s degree in 1933. He completed his Ph.D. degree in 1935 for work on photon scattering with Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. His other research included work on the ionosphere and standard frequency regulations from 1929–1930 with the US National Bureau of Standards, and worked in England on sonar for submarine warfare early in World War II.

Shankland&#x27;s report on the Albert A. Michelson&#x27;s Irvine Ranch experiments was published in 1953. In the British journal &quot;Nature&quot;, Shankland gave the historical background of how Einstein formulates the first two principles, in 1905, of the special theory of relativity from the Michelson–Morley experiment. Shankland believed that the accepted direct explanation for the Michelson–Morley experiment is provided by the special theory of relativity given by Einstein in 1905. Shankland recorded that Michelson&#x27;s Santa Ana trip was to look at the science of the aether.

After completing graduate studies he joined the faculty at Case School for Applied Sciences. In 1941 he succeeded Dayton C. Miller as the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics at Case, a position he held until his retirement in 1976. Shankland worked on neutrino experiments with Argonne National Laboratory from 1953–1969, and had other interests including the history of relativity and architectural acoustics. He collaborated with George Szell, the director of the Cleveland Orchestra, to improve the acoustics of Severance Hall, making it easier for musicians to hear each other on the stage.

Shankland&#x27;s father, Frank North Shankland, was the author of &quot;Modern Romances&quot; and several books on birds and animals. In 1929 Shankland married Hilda Catherine Kinneson. They had five children: Ruth Ellen, Dorothy Margaret, Lois Virginia, Ava Gertrude, and Sherwood Jean, and 14 grandchildren. Hilda died in 1970 and he married Eleanor Newlin. Shankland was a passionate outdoorsman and a knowledgeable collector of iron animal traps and Native American artifacts.

==Analysis of the Miller experiment==

Beginning in 1952, Shankland led a team that performed an analysis of Dayton Miller&#x27;s interferometric results, and concluded that Miller&#x27;s reported positive ether drift was likely caused by thermal fluctuations, and that, when this is taken into account, the results were consistent with special relativity. Shankland&#x27;s explanation is now accepted by most mainstream scientists.

In 1925–1926, Dayton Miller performed interferometric observations at Mount Wilson, similar to the Michelson–Morley experiment, that appeared to reflect a measurable drift of the Earth through the luminiferous aether, in apparent contradiction with other experiments of that type and with relativity&#x27;s prediction that no aether should be observable.

In 1955, Shankland published a paper analyzing Miller&#x27;s data, arguing that &quot;the small periodic fringe displacements found by Miller are due in part to statistical fluctuations in the readings of the fringe positions in a very difficult experiment&quot; and &quot;the remaining systematic effects are ascribed to local temperature conditions.&quot; Moreover, he argues that the thermal gradients responsible for the effects &quot;were much more troublesome at Mount Wilson than those encountered by experimenters elsewhere, including Miller himself in his work done at Case in Cleveland.&quot; In a 1973 review paper on the experimental development of relativity, Shankland included an August 31, 1954 letter to him by Einstein agreeing with his analysis. (Shankland had sent Einstein a manuscript prior to its publication.) Einstein wrote:

:I thank you very much for sending me your careful study about the Miller experiments. Those experiments, conducted with so much care, merit, of course, a very careful statistical investigation. This is more so as the existence of a not trivial positive effect would affect very deeply the fundament of theoretical physics as it is presently accepted.
:You have shown convincingly that the observed effect is outside the range of accidental deviations and must, therefore, have a systematic cause. You made it quite probable that this systematic cause has nothing to do with &quot;ether-wind,&quot; but has to do with differences of temperature of the air traversed by the two light bundles which produced the bands of interference. Such an effect is indeed practically inevitable if the walls of the laboratory room have a not negligible difference in temperature.
:It is one of the cases where the systematic errors are increasing quickly with the dimension of the apparatus.

In Shankland&#x27;s re-analysis, no statistically significant signal for the existence of aether was found. The analysis is accepted by mainstream physicists, the abandonment of the concept of the aether is nearly universal, and Miller&#x27;s observed signal is believed the result of experimenter&#x27;s bias; the &quot;signal&quot; that Miller observed in 1933 is actually composed of points that are an average of several hundred measurements each, and the magnitude of the signal is more than 10 times smaller than the resolution with which the measurements were recorded.

Though Maurice Allais and James DeMeo do not accept Shankland&#x27;s refutation and hold to the belief that Miller&#x27;s experiment invalidates the theory of relativity, Einstein&#x27;s theory is today regarded by most physicists as proven, based largely on the vastly more accurate repetitions of Miller&#x27;s measurements made using modern optical technology by numerous independent researchers that have shown conclusively that Miller&#x27;s reported positive signal was spurious. Miller&#x27;s data, and Shankland&#x27;s analysis of it, are now of only historical interest.

<doc id="716738" wikidata="Q676513" url="?curid=716738" title="Meet Joe Black">
<text>Meet Joe Black is a 1998 American romantic fantasy drama film directed and produced by Martin Brest, starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, and Claire Forlani. Celebrating his 65th birthday, businessman and devoted family man Bill Parrish is visited by Death, who wants to know what it&#x27;s like to be human in return for giving Bill extra days of his life. The screenplay was written by Bo Goldman, Kevin Wade, Ron Osborn, and Jeff Reno, and is loosely based on the 1934 film &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;, which is itself based on the 1929 play &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; by Walter Ferris, which is in turn an English-language adaptation of the 1924 Italian play &quot;La morte in vacanza&quot; by Alberto Casella.

==Plot==
Media mogul Bill Parrish is contemplating a merger with another media giant. Meanwhile, his eldest daughter, Allison, is planning an elaborate 65th birthday party for him. His younger daughter Susan, a resident in internal medicine, has a relationship with Drew, a member of Bill&#x27;s board. As Bill contemplates Susan&#x27;s planned marriage to Drew and realizes that she is not deeply in love, he suggests that she wait to be swept off her feet.

After Bill&#x27;s company helicopter lands at his office, he hears a voice that he tries to ignore. Arriving in his office, Bill has pains in his chest and hears the voice again, saying &quot;yes&quot;.

While studying in a coffee shop near her hospital, Susan meets a young man and forms a connection. She departs without getting his name. Unbeknownst to her, directly afterward, he is struck fatally by multiple cars.

That evening, Bill hears the voice again that summons him to a room. Materializing, the voice identifies itself as &quot;Death&quot; and now inhabits the body of the young man Susan met at the coffee shop. Death explains that Bill&#x27;s impassioned speech to his daughter piqued his interest. Given Bill&#x27;s &quot;competence, experience, and wisdom&quot;, Death says that for as long as Bill is his guide on Earth, Bill will not have to die. They both return to the dinner table and under pressure to make an introduction, Bill names the young man &quot;Joe Black&quot;. Joe does not seem to know how to drink, eat, or use food and utensils.

Drew secretly conspires to sell Parrish Communications, despite Bill&#x27;s strong objections. Capitalizing on Bill&#x27;s strange behavior and reliance on Joe, he convinces the board of directors to vote Bill out as chairman and to approve the merger.

Intrigued by Joe&#x27;s naivete, Susan realizes he is different from the young man she met in the coffee shop. She falls in love with him and he with her. Later, Bill sees them kissing.

Bill angrily confronts Joe about his relationship with Susan. He then suggests to Susan that Joe will not be around much longer. At Susan&#x27;s hospital, Joe interacts with a terminally ill woman, who wishes to die to escape her constant physical pain. She realizes that Joe is part of her impending death. When Joe mentions that he loves Susan (whose care she is under), they discuss the meaning of life and she tells him the danger of meshing two worlds. When Joe asks if she is ready to go, she nods her head and dies.

As Bill&#x27;s birthday arrives, Joe declares his intention to take Susan with him. Bill pleads with Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and to not steal Susan&#x27;s life.

At the party, knowing his death is imminent, Bill says goodbye to his daughters. Susan tells Joe she has loved him since the day in the coffee shop. Joe decides to allow her to live.

Quince apologizes to Bill for unwittingly undermining Bill&#x27;s position, and Bill forgives him. Joe helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew&#x27;s underhanded business dealings to the board by claiming to be an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail.

Susan and Bill later say goodbye. Fireworks begin, and on a hilltop above the party, Joe waits with tears in his eyes. Bill heads up to him, and they share their thoughts. Susan watches Joe and Bill cross a nearby bridge and descend out of sight on the other side. Joe reappears alone. He is again the young man from the coffee shop, uninjured and not comprehending where he is. Susan descends hand-in-hand with the young man toward the party with the fireworks bursting all around them.

==Production ==
===Filming ===
Most of William Parrish&#x27;s country mansion scenes were shot at the Aldrich Mansion in Rhode Island.

The penthouse interiors and Parrish Communications offices were sets built at the 14th Regiment Armory in the South Slope neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.

The coffee shop where Susan meets the young man is Broadway Restaurant, at 2664 Broadway and West 101st Street in New York&#x27;s Manhattan. Principal photography commenced on 11 June 1997 and concluded on 12 November 1997. The restaurant closed permanently in June 2023.

===Versions ===
A two-hour version was made to show on television and airline flights, by cutting most of the plotline involving Bill Parrish&#x27;s business. Since Director Martin Brest derided this edit of his film and disowned it, the director&#x27;s credit on this release used Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee.

==Release==
The film premiered as the closing night film of the Tokyo International Film Festival on 8 November 1998.

&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; opened in the United States and Canada on the weekend of 13–15 November 1998, and had a weekend gross of $15,017,995 ranking #3, behind &quot;The Waterboy&quot;″s second weekend and the opening of &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;.

While the film had a disappointing box office gross in the United States and Canada of $44,619,100, it fared much better internationally. Taking in an additional $98,321,000, the movie grossed a worldwide total of $142,940,100.

As &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; was one of the few films showing the first trailer for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, it was reported that &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans bought tickets just to see the trailer and then left right after it finished playing.

===Critical response===
&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with most complimenting the performances but criticizing the film&#x27;s three-hour length, the slow pacing, and the screenplay. Roger Ebert gave it three stars, but disliked the peripheral storylines and overly drawn-out ending. He concluded that despite its flaws, &quot;there&#x27;s so much that&#x27;s fine in this movie&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that most of the characters were one-dimensional. Hopkins received uniform praise for his performance, with Travers opining that Hopkins&#x27; Bill Parrish was the only fully realized character in the film; Mick LaSalle wrote that &quot;Hopkins&#x27; acting is so emotionally full that the tiniest moments...ring with complexities of thought and feeling.&quot; Pitt, on the other hand, received a mixed response, with LaSalle calling his performance so bad &quot;it hurts&quot; and James Berardinelli calling it &quot;execrable&quot;. Thomas Newman&#x27;s score received critical acclaim; it is generally considered one of his best works.

&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Remake or Sequel, being a takeoff from the film &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 46% approval rating on 52 reviews, with an average score of 5.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is pretty to look at and benefits from an agreeable cast, but that isn&#x27;t enough to offset this dawdling drama&#x27;s punishing three-hour runtime.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a 43% score on 24 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore graded the film &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A to F.

In retrospect, Brad Pitt views &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; as a low point in his career, feeling he lacked direction at the time. He admitted to underperforming, saying, &quot;I dogged it. I muffed it.&quot; He believes someone else could have done a better job and regrets taking the role, stating it was &quot;the pinnacle of my…loss of direction and compass.&quot; While he praises Anthony Hopkins for his performance, he recognizes that he didn’t fully connect with the material.

<text>The sabbath year (shmita; , literally &quot;release&quot;), also called the sabbatical year or &quot;shǝvi&#x27;it&quot; (, literally &quot;seventh&quot;), or &quot;Sabbath of The Land&quot;, is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the Torah in the Land of Israel and is observed in Judaism.

During &quot;shmita&quot;, the land is left to lie fallow and all agricultural activity, including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting, is forbidden by &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law). Other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as a preventive measure only, not to improve the growth of trees or other plants. Additionally, any fruits or herbs which grow of their own accord and where no watch is kept over them are deemed &quot;hefker&quot; (ownerless) and may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of &quot;shmita&quot; produce. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted.

Chapter 25 of the Book of Leviticus promises bountiful harvests to those who observe the &quot;shmita&quot;, and describes its observance as a test of religious faith.

The most recent &quot;shmita&quot; year was 2021–2022 or Anno mundi 5782 in the Hebrew calendar. The next &quot;shmita&quot; cycle will be in 2028–2029, year 5789 in the Hebrew calendar.

==Ancient Israel==
===Ancient Near East fallow years===

It is still discussed among scholars of the Ancient Near East whether or not there is clear evidence for a seven-year cycle in Ugaritic texts. It is also debated how the biblical seventh fallow year would fit in with, for example Assyrian practice of a four-year cycle and crop rotation, and whether the one year in seven was an extra fallow year. suggests that the land may have been farmed only 3 years in seven. Elie Borowski (1987) takes the fallow year as one year in seven.

===Biblical references===

A sabbath year (&quot;shmita&quot;) is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible by name or by its pattern of six years of activity and one of rest: 
* Book of Exodus: &quot;You may plant your land for six years and gather its crops. But during the seventh year, you must leave it alone and withdraw from it. The needy among you will then be able to eat just as you do, and whatever is left over can be eaten by wild animals. This also applies to your vineyard and your olive grove.&quot; (Exodus 23:10–11)
* Book of Leviticus: &quot;God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, telling him to speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God&#x27;s sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [What grows while] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the employees and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land.&quot; (Leviticus 25:1–7) &quot;And if ye shall say: &#x27;What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase&#x27;; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store.&quot; (Leviticus 25:20–22) &quot; I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. Your land will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and you are in your enemies&#x27; land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years. Thus, as long as it is desolate, [the land] will enjoy the sabbatical rest that you would not give it when you lived there.&quot; (Leviticus 26:33–35)
* Book of Deuteronomy: &quot;At the end of every seven years, you shall celebrate the remission year. The idea of the remission year is that every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and brother when God&#x27;s remission year comes around. You may collect from the alien, but if you have any claim against your brother for a debt, you must relinquish it...&quot; (Deuteronomy 15:1–6) &quot;Moses then gave them the following commandment: &#x27;At the end of each seven years, at a fixed time on the festival of Sukkoth, after the year of release, when all Israel comes to present themselves before God your Lord, in the place that He will choose, you must read this Torah before all Israel, so that they will be able to hear it. &#x27;You must gather together the people, the men, women, children and proselytes from your settlements, and let them hear it. They will thus learn to be in awe of God your Lord, carefully keeping all the words of this Torah. Their children, who do not know, will listen and learn to be in awe of God your Lord, as long as you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to occupy&#x27;.&quot; (Deuteronomy 31:10–13)
* Book of Jeremiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: &quot;At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee&quot;; but your fathers hearkened not unto Me, neither inclined their ear.&quot; (Jeremiah 34:13–14)
* Book of Nehemiah: &quot;and if the peoples of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.&quot; (Nehemiah 10:31)
* Books of Chronicles: &quot;... And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia; to fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had been paid her sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years. (2 Chronicles 36:20–21)
* Books of Kings: (Isaiah speaking) &quot;... And this is the sign for you: This year you shall eat what grows of itself, and the next year what springs from that, and in the third year, sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit. And the survivors of the House of Judah that have escaped shall regenerate its stock below and produce boughs above.&quot; (2 Kings 19:29).

The 2 Kings passage (and its parallel in Isaiah 37:30) refers to a sabbath (&quot;shmita&quot;) year followed by a jubilee (&quot;yovel&quot;) year. The text says that in the first year the people were to eat &quot;what grows of itself&quot;, which is expressed by one word in the Hebrew, &quot;saphiah&quot; (ספיח). In Leviticus 25:5, the reaping of the &quot;saphiah&quot; is forbidden for a Sabbath year, explained by rabbinic commentary to mean the prohibition of reaping in the ordinary way (with, for example, a sickle), but permitted to be plucked in a limited way by one&#x27;s own hands for one&#x27;s immediate needs during the Sabbath year.

There is an alternative explanation used to rectify what appears to be a discrepancy in the two biblical sources, taken from Adam Clarke&#x27;s 1837 Bible commentary. The Assyrian siege had lasted until after planting time in the fall of 701 BCE, and although the Assyrians left immediately after the prophecy was given (2 Kings 19:35), they had consumed the harvest of that year before they left, leaving only the &quot;saphiah&quot; to be gleaned from the fields. In the next year, the people were to eat &quot;what springs from that&quot;, Hebrew &quot;sahish&quot; (סחיש). Since this word occurs only here and in the parallel passage in Isaiah 37:30, where it is spelled שחיס, there is some uncertainty about its exact meaning. If it is the same as the &quot;shabbat ha-arets&quot; (שבת הארץ) that was permitted to be eaten in a Sabbath year in Leviticus 25:6, then there is a ready explanation why there was no harvest: the second year, i.e. the year starting in the fall of 700 BCE, was a Sabbath year, after which normal sowing and reaping resumed in the third year, as stated in the text.

Another interpretation obviates all of the speculation about the Sabbath year entirely, translating the verse as: &quot;And this shall be the sign for you, this year you shall eat what grows by itself, and the next year, what grows from the tree stumps, and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&quot; According to the Judaica Press commentary, it was Sennacherib&#x27;s invasion that prevented the people of Judah from sowing in the first year and Isaiah was promising that enough plants would grow to feed the population for the rest of the first year and the second year. Therefore, Isaiah was truly providing a sign to Hezekiah that God would save the city of Jerusalem, as explicitly stated, and not an injunction concerning the Sabbath (&quot;shmita&quot;) or jubilee (&quot;yovel&quot;) years, which are not mentioned at all in the passage.

==Historical &quot;shmita&quot; years==

Various attempts have been made to reconstruct when Sabbatical years actually fell using clues in the biblical text and events clearly dated in fixed historically understood calendars. This is important because the system of &quot;shmita&quot; and Jubilee years provides a useful check in deciding between competing reconstructions of the histories of the First Temple period and earlier and the history of the Second Temple period and later. There are explicit mentions of a Sabbatical year found in Josephus, 1 Maccabees, and in various legal contracts from the time of Simon bar Kokhba. In contrast, no direct statements that a certain year was a Sabbatical year have survived from First Temple times and earlier.

The Jewish method of calculating the recurring Sabbatical year (&quot;shmita&quot;) has been greatly misunderstood by modern chroniclers of history, owing to their unfamiliarity with Jewish practice, which has led to many speculations and inconsistencies in computations. According to Maimonides (&quot;Mishne Torah&quot;, &quot;Hil. Shmita ve-Yovel&quot; 10:7), during the Second Temple period, the seven-year cycle which repeated itself every seven years was actually dependent upon the fixation of the Jubilee, or the fiftieth year, which year temporarily broke off the counting of the seven-year cycle. Moreover, the laws governing the Jubilee (e.g. release of Hebrew bondmen, and the return of leased property to its original owners, etc.) were never applied all throughout the Second Temple period, but the Jubilee was being used during the period of the Second Temple in order to fix and sanctify thereby the Sabbatical year. A Sabbatical year could not be fixed without the year of the Jubilee, since the Jubilee serves to break-off the 7 x 7-year cycle, before resuming its count once again in the 51st year. While the 49th year is also a Sabbatical year, the fiftieth year is not the 1st year in a new seven-year cycle, but rather is the Jubilee. Its number is not incorporated into the seven-year cycle. Rather, the new seven-year cycle begins afresh in the 51st year, and in this manner is the cycle repeated. After the Temple&#x27;s destruction, the people began a new practice to number each seventh year as a Sabbatical year, without the necessity of adding a fiftieth year.

==Rabbinical interpretations==

The rabbis of the Talmud and later times interpreted the &quot;shmita&quot; laws in various ways to ease the burden they created for farmers and the agricultural industry. The &quot;heter mechira&quot; (leniency of sale), developed for the &quot;shmita&quot; year of 1888–1889, permitted Jewish farmers to sell their land to non-Jews so that they could continue to work the land as usual during &quot;shmita&quot;. This temporary solution to the impoverishment of the Jewish settlement in those days was later adopted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel as a permanent edict, generating ongoing controversy between Zionist and Haredi leaders to this day. There is a major debate among halakhic authorities as to what is the nature of the obligation of the Sabbatical year nowadays. Some say it is still biblically binding, as it has always been. Others hold that it is rabbinically binding, since the &quot;shmita&quot; only biblically applies when the Jubilee year is in effect, but the Sages of the Talmud legislated the observance of the &quot;shmita&quot; anyway as a reminder of the biblical statute. And yet others hold that the &quot;shmita&quot; has become purely voluntary. An analysis by respected posek and former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef in his responsa &quot;Yabi&#x27;a Omer&quot; (Vol. 10), accorded with the middle option, that the biblical obligation holds only when a majority of the Jewish people is living in the biblical Land of Israel and hence the &quot;shmita&quot; nowadays is a rabbinic obligation in nature. This approach potentially admits for some leniencies which would not be possible if the Shemitah were biblical in origin, including the aforementioned sale of the land of Israel. Haredi authorities, on the other hand, generally follow the view of the Chazon Ish, that the &quot;shmita&quot; continues to be a biblical obligation.

Rabbi Joshua Falk, author of &quot;Sefer Me&#x27;irat Einayim&quot; on &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot;, holds that &quot;shmita&quot; nowadays is only a rabbinic obligation, and, subsequently, the biblical promise of bounty for those who observe the &quot;shmita&quot; (Leviticus 25:20–22) only applies when the biblical obligation is in effect, and hence that the biblical promise of bounty is not in effect today. However, the Chazon Ish, who holds that the biblical obligation of &quot;shmita&quot; observance remains in effect today, holds that the biblical promise of bounty follows it and Divine bounty is promised to Jews living in the Land of Israel today, just as it was promised in ancient times. However, he holds that Jews should generally not demand miracles from Heaven and hence that one should not rely on this promise for one&#x27;s sustenance, but should instead make appropriate arrangements and rely on permissible leniencies.

==Observance in the Land of Israel==
According to the laws of shmita, land owned by Jews in the Land of Israel is left unfarmed. The law does not apply to land in the Diaspora. Any naturally growing produce was not to be formally harvested, but could have been eaten by its owners, as well as left to be taken by poor people, passing strangers, and beasts of the field. While naturally growing produce such as grapes growing on existing vines can be harvested, it cannot be sold or used for commercial purposes; it must be given away or consumed. Personal debts are considered forgiven at sunset on 29 Elul. Since this aspect of shmita is not dependent on the land, it applies to Jews both in Israel and elsewhere.

As produce grown on land in Israel owned by Jewish farmers cannot be sold or consumed, fruits and vegetables sold in a shmita year may be derived from five sources:

* Produce grown during the sixth year, to which the laws of the seventh year do not apply.
* Produce grown on land owned by non-Jewish (typically, Arab) farmers in Israel.
* Produce grown on land outside the halakhic boundaries of Israel (&quot;chutz la&#x27;aretz&quot;).
* Produce (mainly fruits) distributed through the storehouse of the rabbinical court.
* Produce grown in greenhouses.

There is a requirement that &quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot; produce be consumed for personal use and cannot be sold or put in trash. For this reason, there are various special rules regarding the religious use of products that are normally made from agricultural produce. Some authorities hold that Hanukkah candles cannot be made from &quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot; oils because the light of Hanukkah candles is not supposed to be used for personal use, while Shabbat candles can be because their light can be used for personal use. For similar reasons, some authorities hold that if the Havdalah is performed using wine made from &quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot; grapes, the cup should be drunk completely and the candle should not be dipped into the wine to extinguish the flame as is normally done.

The &quot;otzar beit din&quot; system is structured in such a way that &quot;biur&quot; remains the responsibility of members of individual households and hence warehoused produce does not have to be moved to a public place or reclaimed at the &quot;biur&quot; time. Households only have to perform &quot;biur&quot; on produce they receive before the &quot;biur&quot; time, not on produce they receive after it.

Because the Orthodox rules of Kashrut have strictures requiring certain products, such as wine, to be produced by Jews, the leniency of selling one&#x27;s land to non-Jews is unavailable for these products, since these strictures would render the wine non-Kosher. Accordingly, wine made from grapes grown in the land of Israel during the &quot;shmita&quot; year is subject to the full strictures of &quot;shmita&quot;. New vines cannot be planted. Although grapes from existing vines can be harvested, they and their products cannot be sold.

While obligatory to the Orthodox as a matter of religious observance, observance of the rules of &quot;shmita&quot; is voluntary so far as the civil government is concerned in the contemporary State of Israel. Civil courts do not enforce the rules. A debt would be transferred to a religious court for a document of prosbul only if both parties voluntarily agreed to do so. Many non-religious Israeli Jews do not observe these rules, although some non-religious farmers participate in the symbolic sale of land to non-Jews to permit their produce to be considered kosher and sellable to Orthodox Jews who permit the leniency. Despite this, during &quot;shmita&quot;, crop yields in Israel fall short of requirements so importation is employed from abroad.

==Talmudic references==

Tractate Shevi&#x27;it, the fifth tractate of &quot;Seder Zeraim&quot; (&quot;Order of Seeds&quot;) of the Mishnah, deals with the laws of leaving the fields of the Land of Israel to lie fallow every seventh year; the laws concerning which produce may, or may not be eaten during the Sabbatical year; and with the cancellation of debts and the rabbinical ordinance established to allow a creditor to reclaim a debt after the Sabbatical year. The tractate comprises ten chapters in the Mishna and eight in the Tosefta and has thirty-one folio pages of Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud. Like most tractates in the order of &quot;Zeraim&quot;, there is no Babylonian Talmud for this tractate.

According to the Talmud, observance of the Sabbatical year is of high accord, and one who does not do so may not be allowed to be a witness in a beth din (rabbinical court). Nonetheless, Rabbinic Judaism has developed Halakhic (religious legal) devices to be able to maintain a modern agricultural and commercial system while giving heed to the biblical injunctions. Such devices represent examples of flexibility within the Halakhic system.

Hillel the Elder, in the first century BCE, used the rule that remittance of debts applies only to debts between Jews, to develop a device known as &quot;prozbul&quot; in which the debt is transferred to a beth din. When owed to the court rather than to an individual, the debt survives the Sabbatical year. This device, formulated early in the era of Rabbinic Judaism when the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing, became a prototype of how Judaism was later to adapt to the destruction of the Second Temple and maintain a system based on biblical law under very different conditions.

The rabbis of the Jerusalem Talmud created rules to impose order on the harvesting process including a rule limiting harvesters working on others&#x27; land to taking only enough to feed themselves and their families. They also devised a system, called &quot;otzar beit din&quot;, under which a rabbinical court supervised a communal harvesting process by hiring workers who harvested the fields, stored it in communal storage facilities, and distributed it to the community.

There exists a major difference of opinion between two Acharonim, Joseph Karo and Moses ben Joseph di Trani, as to whether produce grown on land in Israel which is owned by non-Jews also has sanctity. According to Karo, such produce has no sanctity and may be used and/or discarded in the same way as any produce grown outside of Israel. According to di Trani, the fact that this produce was grown in Israel, even by non-Jews, gives it sanctity, and it must be treated in the special ways detailed above.

Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, a noted Haredi halakhic authority who issued key rulings on Jewish agricultural law in the 1930s and 1940s, ruled like di Trani, holding that produce grown on land in Israel owned by non-Jews has sanctity. Karelitz&#x27;s ruling was adopted first by the religious families of Bnei Brak and is popularly called &quot;Minhag Chazon Ish&quot; (the custom of the &quot;Chazon Ish&quot;).

The rabbis of Jerusalem, on the other hand, embraced the opinion of Karo that produce farmed on land owned by non-Jews has no sanctity. This opinion is now called &quot;Minhag Yerushalayim&quot; &quot;the custom of Jerusalem&quot;, and was adopted by many Haredi families, by British Mandate Palestine, and by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.

These respective opinions are reflected in the way the various kashrut-certifying organizations publicize their &quot;shmita&quot; and non-&quot;shmita&quot; produce. The Edah HaChareidis, which follows &quot;Minhag Yerushalayim,&quot; buys produce from non-Jewish farms in Israel and sells it as &quot;non-&quot;shmita&quot; produce&quot;. The Shearit Yisrael certifying organization, which subscribes to &quot;Minhag Chazon Ish,&quot; also buys from non-Jewish farmers in Israel, but labels the produce as such so that customers who keep &quot;Minhag Chazon Ish&quot; will treat these fruits and vegetables with appropriate sanctity.

In halakha (Jewish law), produce of the Seventh Year that is subject to the laws of &quot;shmita&quot; is called &quot;sheviit&quot;. &quot;Shevi&#x27;it&quot; produce has sanctity requiring special rules for its use:

*It can only be consumed or used (in its ordinary use) for personal enjoyment
*It cannot be bought, sold, or thrown out.
*It must be used in its &quot;best&quot; manner so as to ensure fullest enjoyment (For example, fruits that are normally eaten whole cannot be juiced).
*It can only be stored so long as naturally-growing plants of the given species can be eaten by animals in the fields. Once a particular species is no longer available in the field, one must rid one&#x27;s house of it through a process known as &quot;biur&quot;.

By biblical law, Jews who own land are required to make their land available during the &quot;shmita&quot; to anyone who wishes to come in and harvest. If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor potted plants. Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the rabbis of the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud imposed rabbinic ordinances on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent a few individuals from taking everything. Harvesters on others&#x27; land are permitted to take only enough to feed themselves and their families.

==Aftergrowths==

According to the Mosaic law, grains, fruits, legumes and vegetables are permitted to be eaten in the Seventh Year, yet must they be harvested in an irregular fashion, and only as much as a person might need for their sustenance, without the necessity of hoarding the fruits in granaries and storehouses. It is not permitted to make merchandise of Seventh Year produce. These restrictions are implied by the biblical verse, &quot;You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest, nor gather the grapes of your untended vines&quot; (), and by the supportive verse, &quot;In the Seventh Year you must let it (i.e. the ground) rest and lie fallow, so that the poor among your people may eat from the field and the wild animals may consume what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and olive grove&quot; (). Grain cannot be harvested by using a sickle, nor can a person reap an entire field, or make use of beasts to separate the grain from the husks by treading. Grapes that are on the vine can be taken, sufficient for ones immediate needs, but they cannot be pressed in a winepress, but only in a small tub.

When certain farmers began to secretly sow their fields during the Seventh Year and to harvest what they had planted, and to cover-up their action by saying that such produce was a mere aftergrowth from last year&#x27;s planting, the Sages of Israel were compelled to enact restrictions on Seventh Year produce and to forbid all aftergrowths () of grain, legumes and those vegetables which are usually planted by mankind, in order to put an end to their deception. Other rabbinic authorities prohibit only the aftergrowths of vegetables, but permit the aftergrowths of legumes and grain. They permitted, however, to pick the fruits of trees that grow of themselves during the Seventh Year, for one&#x27;s immediate needs, and to gather such vegetables and herbs that are not normally planted by humans, such as wild rue (&quot;Ruta chalepensis&quot;), either wild asparagus (&quot;Asparagus aphyllus&quot;) or amaranth (&quot;Amaranthus blitum var. silvestre&quot;), purslane (&quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;), wild coriander (&quot;Coriandrum sativum&quot;), parsley growing alongside rivers (&quot;Apium graveolens&quot;), garden rocket growing in marshlands (&quot;Eruca sativa&quot;), sweet marjoram (&quot;Majorana syriaca&quot;), white-leaved savory (&quot;Micromeria fruticosa&quot;), and the like of such things. Had any of these been kept watch over in the courtyard of a house, their aftergrowths would be forbidden to eat in the Seventh Year. Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham permits the gathering of aftergrowths of mustard greens (&quot;Sinapis alba&quot;) during the Seventh Year.

An ancient practice in the Land of Israel was to permit the gathering of spring onions which grew of themselves during the Seventh Year, after the first rains had fallen upon them and sprouted.

The laws governing &quot;Aftergrowths&quot; apply only to crops grown in the Land of Israel.

==&quot;Heter mechira&quot;==
In the late 19th century, in the early days of Zionism, Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor came up with a halakhic means of allowing agriculture to continue during the &quot;shmita&quot; year. After ruling in favor of &quot;Minhag Yerushalayim&quot;, that the biblical prohibition consists of not cultivating the land owned by Jews (&quot;&quot;your&quot; land&quot;, Exodus 23:10), Rabbi Spektor devised a mechanism by which the land could be sold to a non-Jew for the duration of that year under a trust agreement. Under this plan, the land would belong to the non-Jew temporarily, and revert to Jewish ownership when the year was over. When the land was sold under such an arrangement, Jews could continue to farm it. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of British Mandate Palestine, allowed this principle, not as an ideal, but rather as a limited permit for individuals and times which are considered by Halacha of great need (&quot;b&#x27;shas hadchak&quot;), which became known as the &quot;heter mechira&quot; (lit. &quot;sale permit&quot;). Rabbi Kook explained in a lengthy responsum that the ideal is not to rely on the leniency of heter mechira, but rather to observe shmita according to all opinions. He noted that he himself did not rely on the leniency, it was intended only in a limited time of great need, for those unable to observe the shmita without the leniency.

The &quot;heter mechira&quot; was accepted by Modern Orthodox Judaism and is one of the classic examples of the Modern Orthodox approach toward adapting classical Jewish law to the modern world. However, this approach has not been universally accepted in the Orthodox community and has met with opposition, particularly from Haredi &quot;poskim&quot; (authorities of Jewish law).

In contemporary religious circles these rabbinic leniencies have received wide but not universal acceptance. In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate obtains permission from all farmers who wish to have their land sold. The land is then legally sold to a non-Jew for a large sum of money. The payment is made by a cheque post-dated to after the end of the Sabbatical year. When the cheque is returned or not honoured at the end of the year the land reverts to its original owners. Thus, the fields can be farmed with certain restrictions.

Although the Orthodox Union&#x27;s Kashrut Division accepts &quot;Minhag Yerushalayim&quot; and hence regards the produce of land owned by non-Jews as ordinary produce, it does not currently rely on the &quot;heter mechira&quot; because of doubts about whether the trust arrangement involved effects a valid transfer of ownership.

Some Haredi farmers do not avail themselves of this leniency and seek other pursuits during the &quot;shmita&quot; year.

==Storehouse of the rabbinical court==
The ancient idea of an &quot;otzar beit din&quot; (storehouse of the rabbinical court) is mentioned in the Tosefta (&quot;Sheviit&quot; 8, 1). Under an &quot;otzar beit din&quot;, a community rabbinical court supervises harvesting by hiring workers to harvest, store, and distribute food to the community. Members of the community pay the &quot;beth din&quot;, but this payment represents only a contribution for services, and not a purchase or sale of the food. This Talmudic device was revived in modern times as an alternative to the &quot;heter mechira&quot;.

Because under this approach land cannot be sown but existing plants can be tended and harvested, the approach is applied to orchards, vineyards, and other perennial crops. A &quot;beit din,&quot; or rabbinical court supervising the process, hires farmers as its agents to tend and harvest the crops, and appoints the usual distributors and shopkeepers as its agents to distribute them. Individual consumers appoint the court and its designees as their agents and pay monies to court-appointed designees as agents of the court. Thus, under this approach, a legal arrangement is created whereby the crops themselves are never bought or sold, but rather people are merely paid for their labor and expenses in providing certain services. In modern Israel, the &quot;badatz&quot; is notable for adapting and supervising such arrangements.

The Orthodox Union notes that &quot;to some, the modern-day &quot;otzar&quot; might seem to be nothing more than a legal sleight of hand. All the regular players are still in place, and distribution rolls along as usual. However, in reality, it is identical only in appearance as prices are controlled, and may correspond only to expenses, with no profit allowed. In addition, the &quot;otzar beit din&quot; does not own the produce. Since it is simply a mechanism for open distribution, any individual is still entitled to collect produce from a field or orchard on his own. Furthermore, all agents of the &quot;beit din&quot; are appointed only if they commit to distributing the produce in accordance with the restrictions that result from its sanctity.&quot;

==&quot;Biur&quot;==

Under the rules of the &quot;shmita&quot;, produce with Sabbatical sanctity (&quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot;) can only be stored as long as plants of the same species (e.g. plants sprouting by themselves) are available to animals in the fields. Once a species is no longer available in the land, halakha requires that it be removed, made ownerless, and made available to anyone who wishes to take it through a procedure called &quot;biur&quot;.

The Orthodox Union describes the contemporary application of the rules of &quot;biur&quot; as follows:

Thus, while the obligation of making one&#x27;s produce available to the public and permitted to all takers can be performed in such a way as to minimize the risk that this availability will actually be utilized, this risk cannot be eliminated. The community at large, including members of the poor, must be afforded some opportunity to take the produce.

&quot;Biur&quot; only applies to produce that has &quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot; sanctity. For this reason, it does not apply to produce grown under the &quot;heter mechira&quot; for those who accept it. (Under the reasoning of the &quot;heter mechira&quot; the shmita does not apply to land owned by non-Jews, so its produce does not have &quot;shevi&#x27;it&quot; sanctity.)

Wine prepared during the Seventh Year (with grapes grown in the same year) may be kept until Passover of the 1st-year cycle. Following the Passover, the wine can no longer be kept over.

== Kabbalah and Chassidut ==

All good and blessing are the life of Jewish people. &quot;Israel could be in death&quot; without this &quot;spiritual-life&quot;, i.e. Holy air of Eretz Israel; Rashi teaches that all Jewish people can say that God has done the Creation and has stated ha&#x27;Aretz as gift to Israel: &quot;if Nations want to take this Land we must teach that in past time all World was &quot;Reign of Kushit&quot; in fact &quot;now all Eretz Israel is in the hand of Jewish people.&quot;&quot;

According to the Chassidut, eating is not only a way to stay alive but even a necessity so that the soul can continue to be strongly inspired by the study of the Torah and the prayer that the Jew performs every day: this means that something material, the food – food can in fact be from the &quot;mineral, vegetable or animal kingdoms&quot; – becomes &quot;sublimated&quot; to enter the sacred area of devotional service to God.

The main alliance between God and the Jewish people consists in continuous Blessings, transcribed also in the Torah; from Moses to Aaron up to the Levites and to the Jewish people as a whole, in the Torah the pact of revelation is established to bind them forever in the Land which can only be that place where it is possible to realize the Kingdom of God.

The event of the gift of the Torah at Mount Sinai involved the whole world, in fact even the angels and other nations were witnesses or spectators of this miraculous event. With Avodah this event is perfectly consolidated until the messianic vision of the reconstruction of Third Temple of Jerusalem.

&quot;Shmita&quot; is therefore abundance of Nature until it becomes holy.

==In modern Israel==

The first &quot;shmita&quot; year in the modern State of Israel was 1951–1952 (5712 in the Hebrew calendar). Subsequent &quot;shmita&quot; years have been 1958–1959 (5719), 1965–1966 (5726), 1972–1973 (5733), 1979–1980 (5740), 1986–1987 (5747), 1993–1994 (5754), 2000–2001 (5761), 2007–2008 (5768), and 2014–2015 (5775). The last &quot;shmita&quot; year began on Rosh Hashanah in September 2021, corresponding to the Hebrew calendar year 5782. The 50th year of the land, which is also a Shabbat of the land, is called &quot;Yovel&quot; in Hebrew, which is the origin of the Latin term &quot;Jubilee&quot;, also meaning 50th. According to the Torah, observance of Jubilee only applies when the Jewish people live in the land of Israel according to their tribes. Thus, with the exile of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Menashe (about 600 BCE) Jubilee has not been applicable. In 2000, Sefardic Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron withdrew religious certification of the validity of permits for the sale of land to non-Jews during the &quot;shmita&quot; year following protests against his endorsement of the leniency by members of the Haredi community.

===Hydroponics===

Authorities who prohibit farming in Israel generally permit hydroponics farming in greenhouses structured so that the plants are not connected to the soil. As a result, hydroponics use has been increasing in Haredi farming communities.

===Shmita 2007–2008===

During the 2007–2008 &quot;shmita&quot;, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel attempted to avoid taking a potentially divisive position on the dispute between Haredi and Modern Orthodox views about the correctness of the &quot;heter mechira&quot; leniency by ruling that local rabbis could make their own decisions about whether or not to accept this device as valid. The Israel Supreme Court, however, ordered the Chief Rabbinate to rescind its ruling and to devise a single national ruling. The Israel Supreme Court opined that divergent local rulings would be harmful to farmers and trade and could implicate competition. The issue of secular courts ordering the rabbinate to rule in particular ways on religious matters aroused a debate within the Knesset. Israeli wineries often address this issue by making separate batches of &quot;shmita&quot; wine, labeled as such, and giving away bottles of &quot;shmita&quot; wine as a free bonus to purchasers of non-&quot;shmita&quot; wine.

==In the First Temple period==

=== The Sabbatical year 868/867 BCE ===

Another public reading of the Law, suggesting a Sabbatical year, took place in the third year of Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 17:7–9). According to the widely accepted biblical chronology of Edwin Thiele, Jehoshaphat began a coregency with his father Asa in 872/871 BCE, and his sole reign began in 870/869. The passage about the reading of the law in Jehoshaphat&#x27;s third year does not specify whether this is measured from the beginning of the coregency or the beginning of the sole reign, but since the two synchronisms to Jehoshaphat&#x27;s reign for the kings of Israel (1 Kings 22:51, 2 Kings 3:1) are measured from the start of the sole reign, it would be reasonable to determine Jehoshaphat&#x27;s third year in the same way. In Thiele&#x27;s system, this would be 867/866. However, Thiele&#x27;s years for the first few kings of Judah has come under criticism as being one year too late, because of problems that appear in the reign of Ahaziah and Athaliah that Thiele never solved. Therefore, in 2003, an article by Rodger Young showed that the texts that Thiele could not reconcile were in harmony when it was assumed that Solomon died before Tishri 1 in the (Nisan-based) year in which the kingdom divided, rather than in the half-year after Tishri 1 as assumed, without explanation, by Thiele. In 2009 Leslie McFall, who is recognized in Finegan&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Biblical Chronology&quot; as the foremost living interpreter of Thiele&#x27;s work, agreed with Young&#x27;s correction that moved dates for Jehoshaphat and the preceding kings of Judah up one year, as have some other recent works by evangelicals and creationists studying this the field. With this resolution to Thiele&#x27;s problem, the year in which Jehoshaphat had the Law read to the people was 868/867. This is 294 years, or 42 Sabbatical cycles, before Ezekiel&#x27;s Jubilee. The 42 Sabbatical cycles would make six Jubilee cycles, so it was also a Jubilee year. It is of some passing interest that in 1869, long before the breakthroughs of Valerius Coucke and Thiele that solved the basic problems of how the biblical authors were measuring the years, Ferdinand Hitzig stated that the occasion for Jehoshaphat&#x27;s proclamation was because it was a Jubilee year.

=== The Sabbatical year 700/699 BCE ===

If 574/573 marked a Jubilee, and if the Sabbatical cycles were in phase with the Jubilees, then 700/699 BCE, the year often mentioned as a possible Sabbatical year because of the land lying fallow during that year (Isaiah 37:30, 2 Kings 19:29), was also a Sabbatical, 126 years or 18 Sabbatical cycles before Ezekiel&#x27;s Jubilee. Assuming a 49-year cycle, the nearest Jubilee would have been in 721 BC, inconsistent with attempts to place a Jubilee after the Sabbatical year at this time. If a 50-year Jubilee cycle is assumed, the nearest Jubilee would be 724/723, and then assuming that a Sabbatical cycle began in the year following a Jubilee, neither 701/700 nor 700/699 would be a Sabbatical year.

Could the passages in Isaiah 37 and 2 Kings 19 be referring to two voluntary fallow years? This might be possible if the Jubilee year was a 50th year separate from the seventh Sabbatical/&quot;shmita&quot; year. Young presents a linguistic argument against this interpretation, as follows: 
Others have imagined that Isa 37:30 and its parallel in 2 Kgs 19:29 refer to a Sabbatical year followed by a Jubilee year, since the prophecy speaks of two years in succession in which there would be no harvest. But the first year could not be a Sabbatical year, because in it the people were allowed to eat &quot;what grows of itself&quot;, for which the Hebrew word is ספיח . In Lev 25:5 the reaping of the ספיח is forbidden during a Sabbatical year. Whatever the exact meaning is for this word, its use in Isaiah&#x27;s prophecy and its prohibition in Lev 25:5 means that the first year of the Isaiah and Second Kings passages could not have been a Sabbatical year. This rules out the possibility that the passage is dealing with a Sabbatical year followed by a year of Jubilee. The proper understanding of the passage is that the harvest of the first year had been destroyed by the Assyrians, and the defeat of the Assyrian army came too late in the year to allow sowing that year. The destruction of the Assyrian host came the night after the giving of the prophecy (2 Kgs 19:35), so the reason that sowing and reaping were forbidden for the next year must have been because that year, the second year of the prophecy, was going to be a Sabbatical year.

=== The Sabbatical year 623/622 BCE ===

It has already been mentioned that the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Megillah&quot; 14b) and the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (ch. 24) mentioned a Jubilee in Josiah&#x27;s 18th year, 623/622 BCE. With the proper assumption of a 49-year cycle for the Jubilee, the Jubilee would be identical to the seventh Sabbatical year, so that the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would never be out of synchronization. 623/622 BCE would therefore also have been a Sabbatical year. In Sabbatical years, the Mosaic code specified that the Law was to be read to all the people (Deuteronomy 31:10–11). Although this commandment, like so many others, was probably neglected throughout most of Israel&#x27;s history, it was observed in Josiah&#x27;s 18th year (2 Kings 23:1,2).

=== The Sabbatical year 588/587 BCE ===

Various scholars have conjectured that Zedekiah&#x27;s release of slaves, described in Jeremiah 34:8–10, would likely have been done at the start of a Sabbatical year. Although the original Mosaic legislation stated that an indentured servant&#x27;s term of service was to end six years after the service started (Deuteronomy 15:12), later practice was to associate the Sabbatical year, called a year of release (&quot;shemitah&quot;) in Deuteronomy 15:9, with the release of slaves. Based on a chronological study of Ezekiel 30:20–21, Nahum Sarna dated Zedekiah&#x27;s emancipation proclamation to the year beginning in Tishri of 588 BCE. Although Zedekiah&#x27;s release of slaves could have occurred at any time, the occurrence of a Sabbatical year at just this time provides some insight into the background that probably influenced Zedekiah&#x27;s thinking, even though the release was later rescinded.

The year 588/587 BCE was also the year that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians, consistent with the Babylonian records for the reign of Amel-Marduk and the Scriptural data regarding Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. This is in keeping with the statement in Seder Olam chapter 30, properly translated as discussed above, that put the burning of the First Temple, as well as the Second, in the &quot;latter part&quot; of a Sabbatical year. The statement of the Seder Olam in this regard is repeated in the Tosefta (&quot;Taanit&quot; 3:9), the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; 4:5), and three times in the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Arakin&quot; 11b, &quot;Arakin 12a&quot;, &quot;Ta&#x27;anit&quot; 29a). An example of the caution that must be exercised when consulting English translations is shown by the Soncino translation in &quot;Arakin&quot; 11b, that the Temple was destroyed &quot;at the end of the seventh [Sabbatical] year&quot;, compared to Jacob Neusner&#x27;s translation of the corresponding passage in the Jerusalem Talmud, that it was &quot;the year after the Sabbatical year&quot;.

=== The Sabbatical year 574/573 BCE ===

A convenient starting place for the study of Sabbatical years in the time of the First Temple is the Jubilee that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate &quot;Arakin&quot; 12a), and also the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (chapter 11), say was the 17th and which began at the time that Ezekiel saw the vision the occupies the last nine chapters of his book. Although many of the chronological statements of the two Talmuds, as well as in the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; that preceded them, have been shown to be unhistorical, this particular statement has considerable evidence to support its historicity. One of these evidences is the consistency of this reference with the other Jubilee mentioned in the Talmud and the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (ch. 24), which is placed in the 18th year of Josiah (&quot;Megillah&quot; 14b). Ezekiel&#x27;s vision occurred in the 25th year of the captivity of Jehoiachin (Ezekiel 40:1). Babylonian records state that Amel-Marduk (the biblical Evil-Merodach) began to reign in October 562 BCE, and 2 Kings 25:27 says that it was in the twelfth month of this accession year (Adar, 561 BCE) and in Jehoiachin&#x27;s 37th year of captivity that Jehoiachin was released from prison. By Judean reckoning, Jehoiachin&#x27;s 37th year would then be 562/561 BCE. His 25th year, the year in which Ezekiel saw his vision, is therefore determined as 574/573 BCE, i.e. the year that began in Tishri of 574. Josiah&#x27;s 18th year, at which time the Talmud says there was another Jubilee, began in 623 BCE, as can be determined from Babylonian records dating the Battle of Carchemish, which occurred shortly after Josiah was slain in his 31st year (2 Kings 22:3, 23:29). This is 49 years before Ezekiel&#x27;s Jubilee, providing evidence that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years, not 50 years as is accepted by many interpreters, but which has been challenged by recent work such as the study of Jean-François Lefebvre. Zuckermann also held that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years, as did Robert North in his notable study of the Jubilees. A fuller discussion of the reasons that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years can be found in the Jubilee article, where it is pointed out that the known chronological methods of the Talmuds and the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; were incapable of correctly calculating the time between Josiah&#x27;s 18th year and the 25th year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, indicating that these remembrances of Jubilees were historical, not contrived.

That Ezekiel saw his vision at the beginning of a Jubilee year is also shown by his statement that it was &quot;in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, on Rosh Hashanah, on the tenth day of the month…;&quot; (Ezekiel 40:1). It was only in a Jubilee year that Rosh Hashanah (New Year&#x27;s Day) came on the tenth of Tishri (Leviticus 25:9), the Day of Atonement. The &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, in relating that Ezekiel&#x27;s vision was at the beginning of a Jubilee, does not cite the part of Ezekiel 40:1 that says it was Rosh Hashanah and the tenth of the month, indicating that the fact that a Jubilee was commencing was based on historical remembrance, not on just the textual argument regarding Rosh Hashanah being on the tenth of the month. Ezekiel also says it was 14 years after the city fell; 14 years before 574/573 BCE was 588/587 BCE, in agreement with &quot;the 25th year of our captivity&quot;.

===Sabbatical years in the Second Temple period===
Sabbatical years have been used to fix the exact time of historical events, as shown in traditional Jewish chronology, but which are rarely understood by modern chroniclers of ancient history.

The first modern treatise devoted to the Sabbatical (and Jubilee) cycles was that of Benedict Zuckermann. Zuckermann insisted that for Sabbatical years after the Babylonian exile &quot;it is necessary to assume the commencement of a new starting-point, since the laws of Sabbatical years and Jubilees fell into disuse during the Babylonian captivity, when a foreign nation held possession of the land of Canaan ... We therefore cannot agree with chronologists who assume an unbroken continuity of septennial Sabbaths and Jubilees.&quot; The &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (ch. 30) is explicit that this was the case, i.e. that the returned exiles had a renewed start of tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years. The first instance of a Sabbatical year treated by Zuckermann was Herod the Great&#x27;s siege of Jerusalem, as described by Josephus. Zuckermann assigned this to 38/37 BCE, i.e. he considered that a Sabbatical year started in Tishri of 38 BCE. Next, he considered John Hyrcanus&#x27;s siege of Ptolemy in the fortress of Dagon, which is described both in Josephus (&quot;Antiquities&quot;. 13.8.1/235; &quot;The Jewish War&quot; 1.2.4/59-60) and 1 Maccabees (16:14–16), and during which a Sabbatical year started; from the chronological information provided in these texts, Zuckermann concluded that 136/135 BCE was a Sabbatical year. The next event to be treated was Antiochus Eupator&#x27;s siege of the fortress Beth-zur (&quot;Ant&quot;. 12.9.5/378, 1 Maccabees 6:53), dated by Zuckermann to 163/162 BCE. However, he also remarked on the difficulties presented to this figure by the text in 1 Maccabees, which would seem to date the siege one year later, and so he decided to leave it out of consideration. The final text considered by Zuckermann was a passage in the Seder Olam that relates the destruction of the Second Temple to a Sabbatical year, an event that is known from secular history to have happened in the summer of 70 CE. Zuckermann interpreted the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; text as stating that this happened in a year after a Sabbatical year, thus placing a Sabbatical in 68/69 CE.

All these dates as calculated by Zuckermann are separated by an integral multiple of seven years, except for the date associated with the siege of Beth-zur. Furthermore, his chronology is consistent with that accepted by the &quot;geonim&quot; (medieval Jewish scholars) and the calendar of Sabbatical years used in present-day Israel. All of this would seem to be strong evidence in favor of Zuckermann&#x27;s scheme. Nevertheless, some problems have been recognized, beyond just the question of the siege of Beth-zur, which was one year too late for Zuckermann&#x27;s calendar. A consistent problem has been the ambiguity alleged in some of the passages, notably of Josephus, where it has been questioned, for example, when Josephus started the regnal years of Herod the Great. In a study the chronology of all Herod&#x27;s reign, Andrew Steinmann presents arguments in favor of dating Herod&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem in 10 Tishre of 37 BCE, i.e. just after the Sabbatical year of 38/37, based on references to the activities of Mark Antony and Sosius, Herod&#x27;s helpers, in Cassius Dio (49.23.1–2) and also on other considerations. This date is in agreement with Ben Zion Wacholder&#x27;s chronology. Therefore, many modern scholars have adopted a Sabbatical year calendar for the Second Temple period that is one year later, although there are many prominent scholars who still maintain a cycle consistent with Zuckermann&#x27;s conclusion of a 38/37 BCE Sabbatical year.

Among those who have advocated an adjustment to Zuckermann&#x27;s chronology, the most extensive studies in its favor have been those of Ben Zion Wacholder. Wacholder had access to legal documents from the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt that were not available to Zuckermann. The arguments of Wacholder and others to support the calendar one year later than that of Zuckermann are rather technical and will not be presented here, except for two items to which Zuckermann, Wacholder, and other scholars have given great weight: 1) the date of Herod&#x27;s capture of Jerusalem from Antigonus, and 2) the testimony of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; relating the destruction of the Second Temple to a Sabbatical year. Wacholder gives the dates of post-exilic Sabbatical years in the following table:
Subsequent to Wacholder&#x27;s study, Yoram Tsafrir and Gideon Foerster published the results of archaeological excavations at Beth Shean in the Levant that verified a record from the Cairo Geniza that gave 749 CE as the year for the &quot;Earthquake of the Sabbatical Year&quot;. According to the Geniza record, the earthquake occurred on 23 Shevat, 679 years after the destruction of the Second Temple; this is January 18, 749 CE in the Julian calendar. 
===&quot;Seder Olam&quot; and the Sabbaticals associated with the destructions of the Temples===

The principal author of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, Rabbi Jose, was a pupil of the famous Rabbi Akiva. Jose was a young man when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and burned the Temple. On such an important issue as the year in which the Temple was destroyed, it would be logical that Jose&#x27;s ideas were taken from his mentor and his mentor&#x27;s contemporaries.

Chapter 30 of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; gives the year that both Temples were destroyed as &quot;be-motsae shevi&#x27;it&quot; (במוצאי שבעית). Heinrich Guggenheimer&#x27;s recent translation renders this phrase as &quot;at the end of a Sabbatical year&quot;, thus unambiguously supporting the Wacholder calendar that starts a Sabbatical year in the fall of 69 CE. The problem, however, is that many translations of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; render the phrase as &quot;in the year after a Sabbatical year&quot; or its equivalent. This was the sense adopted by Zuckermann when citing the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; as supportive of his calendar of Sabbatical years. The same Hebrew phrase is used in the Babylonian Talmud when citing this passage from the &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, and some modern translations of the Talmud into English translate the phrase in the sense given by Guggenheimer, while others translate it in the sense of &quot;the year after&quot;. The &quot;Seder Olam&quot; uses the same phrase regarding a Sabbatical year for the destruction of both Temples, so that its testimony in this regard is important for dating the &quot;shemitot&quot; in both pre-exilic and post-exilic times. Therefore, it would seem necessary to closely examine the phrase in the original Hebrew when making chronological decisions. Unfortunately, this was not done, either by Zuckermann, Wacholder, or Finegan, when citing the &quot;Seder Olam&quot;&#x27;s testimony as decisive for their particular calendars of Sabbatical years. Most interpreters have simply relied on an existing translation, and that translation may have been unduly influenced by an attempt to make the translation consistent with the chronology of the geonim that placed the end of the Second Temple in a post-Sabbatical year.

At least one study has addressed this problem, arguing from both a linguistic standpoint and from a study of related texts in the Seder Olam that the phrase &quot;ve-motsae sheviit&quot; should be translated as something close to &quot;and in the latter part of a Sabbatical year&quot;, consistent with Guggenheimer&#x27;s translation and Wacholder&#x27;s calendar. This recent study argues that a comparative study of the word &quot;motsae&quot; (literally, &quot;goings-out&quot;) does not support any sense of &quot;after&quot; (&quot;after a Sabbatical year&quot;). Further, the reference of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; to a Sabbatical year associated with Jehoiachin is in keeping with a Sabbatical year when the First Temple was burned a few years later, but the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; would be in conflict with itself if the phrase in chapter 30 was interpreted as saying that the burning was in a post-Sabbatical year.

===Jubilee and Sabbatical years as a long-term calendar for Israel===

The Jubilee and Sabbatical year provided a long-term means for dating events, a fact that must have become obvious soon after the legislation was put into effect. It is of some interest, then, that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 40a,b) records that in the time of the judges, legal events such as contracts or criminal cases were dated according to the Jubilee cycle, the Sabbatical cycle within the Jubilee cycle, and the year within the Sabbatical cycle. The Samaritan community apparently used this method of dating as late as the 14th century CE, when an editor of one of the writings of the Samaritans wrote that he finished his work in the sixty-first Jubilee cycle since the entry into Canaan, in the fourth year of the fifth Sabbatical of that cycle. These cases of usage of the Jubilee/Sabbatical cycles make no provision for the possibility of the Sabbatical cycles being out of phase with the Jubilee cycles, which is additional evidence that the Jubilee was contemporaneous with the seventh Sabbatical year.

<text>Christopher Sean Lowe (born 4 October 1959) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, and co-founder of the synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, which he formed with Neil Tennant in 1981.

==Biography==
Christopher Sean Lowe was born and raised in Blackpool, Lancashire, and attended Arnold School. His grandfather was a trombonist and a member of the comedy jazz troupe The Nitwits. His mother was a dancer, and his father, a sales representative, could play piano by ear. Lowe learned trombone and piano and was in the school orchestra and dance band. He studied music as an A-level subject.

Lowe played trombone in a semi-professional seven-piece dance band named One Under the Eight that performed favourites like &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot; and &quot;Moon River&quot;, and he joined the Musicians&#x27; Union with them. He was also in a local brass band, the Norman Memorial Youth Band, and briefly played keyboards with a school rock band called Stallion.

Lowe began studying architecture at the University of Liverpool in 1978 and earned a BA (Hons) in 1981. During a work placement in 1981 at a London architectural practice, he designed a staircase for an industrial estate in Milton Keynes. It was at this time that he met Neil Tennant in Chelsea Record Centre, a hi-fi shop on King&#x27;s Road in London. As their music career developed, Lowe continued his architecture course and got a B.Arch, but did not complete the final work requirement to qualify as an architect before he and Tennant committed full time to the Pet Shop Boys in 1985.

== Musical career ==

===Pet Shop Boys===

Lowe generally performs as the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; keyboardist. He occasionally provides spoken-word or sung vocals and takes the lead on a few songs, including &quot;Paninaro&quot;.

Lowe played trombone on the song &quot;I Want a Lover&quot;, and he appeared with his trombone in the video for the song &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;.

===Solo appearances===
In 1993, he wrote and produced the track &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; for Arsenal footballer Ian Wright. The song featured backing vocals by long-time Pet Shop Boys backing singer Sylvia Mason-James, and the single featured remixes by Rollo.

Two years later, Lowe had a cameo in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. His appearance was filmed while Pet Shop Boys were touring Australia in 1994.

In 2004, he was commissioned to do music for an advertisement for the sunscreen brand Blockhead. The song ended up in a remixed version on a &quot;Café Mambo&quot; compilation.

Lowe wrote the music for the song &quot;Streets of Berlin&quot;, featured in the 2006 revival of &quot;Bent&quot; at the Trafalgar Studios in Whitehall.

In 2011, Lowe appeared as featured vocalist on Stop Modernists&#x27; cover version of the New Order song &quot;Subculture&quot;. It was the first time he had appeared as a vocalist on a non-Pet Shop Boys project.

==Public image==
Lowe adopts an understated public presence, often wearing sportswear and with his eyes hidden behind sunglasses, and usually wearing headwear of some sort (a baseball cap inscribed with the word &quot;BOY&quot; being his most iconic) – although in the duo&#x27;s early years his face was shown fully unobscured. In Pet Shop Boys videos and photoshoots, he is often seen as a spectator standing slightly behind Tennant. For the duo&#x27;s 1988 musical film &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, he spoke very little dialogue compared to Tennant. In live performances he rarely interacts with the audience and often stands still while playing keyboards. In 1995, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that he was &quot;possibly more famous for not doing anything than almost anyone else in the history of popular entertainment.&quot;

A &quot;Guardian&quot; profile of the group from 1993 noted that Lowe&#x27;s image of &quot;silent Chris walking two steps behind singing Neil&quot; was an intentional choice, developed in discussion with photographer and music video director Eric Watson; Watson has said that &quot;Chris didn&#x27;t want to be seen playing keyboards or anything. We realised there was something about somebody singing and somebody else doing nothing – just looking, then looking away – that adds a hideous tension.&quot;

<text>The mesocortical pathway is a dopaminergic pathway that connects the ventral tegmentum to the prefrontal cortex. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. It is essential to the normal cognitive function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe), and is thought to be involved in cognitive control, motivation, and emotional response.

==Other dopamine pathways==
Other major dopamine pathways include:
* mesolimbic pathway
* nigrostriatal pathway
* tuberoinfundibular pathway

<doc id="716754" wikidata="Q748608" url="?curid=716754" title="Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics">
<text>Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics was one of the 102 events at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. It was the fourth time that football was on the Olympic schedule.

Great Britain won the gold medals, representing the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (whom the IOC credits). Replicating the 1908 tournament, Denmark won silver medals and the Netherlands won bronze medals.

The Swedish Football Association ran the tournament, just as the English Football Association had organised the 1908 Olympic football competition in London, England. Three stadiums hosted the eleven matches of the main tournament from 29 June to 4 July 1912. Two were played at Tranebergs Idrottsplats in a suburb of Stockholm, five including the bronze medal match took place at Råsunda Idrottsplats, also outside Stockholm, and four including the final match were held at the Olympiastadion.

Seven teams were eliminated in two rounds ending with the quarterfinal matches, 30 June, and these teams played off in a consolation tournament from 1 July to 5 July, comprising six matches at the same three stadiums. Hungary won the consolation tournament.

==Competition schedule==

==Venues==
==Participants==
The tournament saw a record 14 teams enter, all of them from Europe: however, the entry of Bohemia was rejected as their association had been voted out of FIFA in 1908, while Belgium withdrew two weeks before the draw due to a lack of players being available to travel. Subsequently, France withdrew three days after the draw: their opponents, Norway, were awarded a 2–0 victory.

The Football Association entered a Great Britain national amateur team to represent the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Ireland).

A total of 135+28 footballers from 11 nations competed at the Stockholm Games:

* &quot;part of Austria-Hungary&quot;
* (13) &quot;Grand Duchy of Finland, ruled by Russian Empire&quot;
* &quot;team played all matches as England&quot;
* &quot;part of Austria-Hungary&quot;
* 
* 

== Course of the tournament ==
In the first round of the tournament, the hosts from Sweden went out in the opening match against the Netherlands. Fighting back from a 1–3 deficit with half an hour to go, Sweden only lost 4–3 on a goal scored by Dutch player Jan Vos in extra time. At Tranebergs Idrottsplats, Austrian football pioneer Hugo Meisl was the referee as Finland beat Italy, also in extra time.

In the second round, Finland won again, this time beating Russia, who had received a bye in the first round. By this stage, Great Britain team entered the contest, drawn to play against Hungary at Olympiastadion. Great Britain was captained by Vivian Woodward, a record-scoring centre-forward from Chelsea, who had formed part of Great Britain&#x27;s gold medal winning side of the 1908 Summer Olympics. Led by forward Harold Walden, who scored six goals, Great Britain defeated Hungary by 7–0.

In the semi-final round, Walden scored all four goals as Great Britain defeated Finland 4–0. In the other semi-final Denmark beat the Netherlands 4–1; the Dutch consolation goal put behind goalkeeper Sophus Hansen by Danish defender Harald Hansen. For the second successive time, the final would pair Great Britain with Denmark, and like in 1908, the team representing Great Britain would win gold medals, although this game would be closer than the 4–2 score-line suggested. With no rule allowing substitutions, Denmark played with ten men after the 30th minute when Charles Buchwald was injured and had to be taken from the pitch on a stretcher.

A consolation tournament ran conjunctively with the tournament proper paired the losers of the first and second rounds, and was eventually won by Hungary, although no medals were awarded for the top three finishers in that tournament.

German player Gottfried Fuchs equalled the record for most goals in an international (set by Dane Sophus Nielsen in the 1908 Olympics) with 10 goals for Germany against Russia; this record stood until 2001.

<doc id="716756" wikidata="Q5646" url="?curid=716756" title="Atong language (Sino-Tibetan)">
<text>A.tong is one of the Garo dialect Sino-Tibetan (or Tibeto-Burman) language which is also related to Koch, Rabha, Bodo other than Garo language. It is spoken in the South Garo Hills and West Khasi Hills districts of Meghalaya state in Northeast India, southern Kamrup district in Assam, and adjacent areas in Bangladesh. The spelling &quot;A.tong&quot; is based on the way the speakers themselves pronounce the name of their language. There is no glottal stop in the name and it is not a tonal language.

A reference grammar of the language has been published by Seino van Breugel. A dictionary with Atong–English and English-A.tong sections, as well as semantic word lists was published in 2021, two years after the publication of an analysis of A.tong stories. In 2009, a book of stories in A.tong and an Atong-English dictionary were published by and sold at the Tura Book Room in Tura, Meghalaya, India. It is not certain if those books are still available there. The A.tong spelling system used in those books is explained in the A.tong Spelling Guide, available online.

Atong has been classified as an endangered language by Ethnologue. Atong&#x27;s situation is most probably due to the influence of Standard Garo, a prestige language in the State of Meghalaya. Many parents are not teaching Atong to their children anymore. However, there are still places in South Garo Hills and West Khasi Hills where Atong is still spoken and also transmitted to the younger generation.

==Sociolinguistics==
There is no current estimate of the number of speakers available; according to the Linguistic Survey of India, it was spoken by approximately 15,000 people in the 1920s. Since the Atong are considered a subdivision of the Garos, they are not counted as a separate ethnic or linguistic community by the Indian government.

Almost all Atong speakers are bilingual in Garo to a greater or lesser extent, and Garo is seen as the more prestigious language. Because there is a Bible translation in Garo, but not in Atong, it is the language used in all churches and most Atong speakers are Christians. Garo is also the language of education in schools in the Atong-speaking area, although some schools provide education in English.

===Mutual intelligibility with Garo===
In India, the Atongs are considered to belong to the Garo Tribe, however, they speak a distinct language, which, however, has no official status of its own. The Atong people are members of the Garo Scheduled Tribe, whose official Scheduled tribe language is Garo. Garo has a standardised form of speech used in education, administration, the press and literature. Linguistically speaking, Atong and Standard Garo may be different languages, given that they have different sound systems, vocabulary and grammar. However, due to the fact that most Atongs are bilingual in Standard Garo to various degrees, intelligibility is one-way: Atong speakers understand Standard Garo but speakers of Standard Garo may not understand Atong.

== Phonology ==

The phonemes of Atong are given in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in Table 1. That table also presents how the phonemes are written in the Atong alphabet used for everyday writing by people who are not linguists. As we can see in the table, the glottal stop can be written with either a bullet or an apostrophe. The bullet was used by missionaries to write the glottal stop in Garo when the writing system for that language was created in the 1800s. The apostrophe has since been adopted to write the glottal stop as it is available on all computer keyboards. The vowel phoneme is written in the orthography, as it is in Khasi and Welsh. It was the Welsh Presbyterians that developed the Khasi writing system and used the letter to write the phoneme in Khasi.

The consonant phoneme has aspirated and non-aspirated pronunciations [sʰ ~ s]. The aspirated allophone , occurs at the beginning of a syllable, while the unaspirated occurs the end of a syllable. Both phonemes are written with the letter . Aspirated also occurs in other Asian languages such as Burmese and Korean.

=== Glottalization ===

Glottalization in Atong is a feature that operates on the level of the syllable, and that manifests itself as a glottal stop at the end of the syllable. Glottalization only affects open syllables and syllables ending in a continuant or a vowel. In the following examples, glottalized syllables are indicated by a following bullet. The pronunciation is given between square brackets where the symbol represents the glottal stop and the full stop represents the syllable boundary.

In the examples below, the following abbreviations are used: COS &#x27;change of state&#x27;, CUST &#x27;customary aspect&#x27;, INCOM &#x27;incompletive aspect&#x27;, NEG &#x27;negative&#x27;,

If the glottalized continuant is followed by a consonant, the glottalized phoneme is not released, i.e. &quot;man&#x27; -khu-cha&quot; (be.able-INCOM-NEG)&#x27;is not yet possible&#x27;.

If the glottalized continuant is followed by a vowel, it is released and the release repeats the continuant so that it can be said to act like the onset of the following syllable, e.g. &quot;man&#x27; -ok&quot; (be.able-COS) &#x27;was able&#x27;.

In a glottalized syllable with final the glottal stop usually precedes the oral closure of the when followed by another vowel, e.g. &quot;mel&#x27; -a&quot; (be.fat-CUST)&#x27;is fat&#x27;. This phenomenon also happens, but less frequently, with syllables ending in , e.g. &quot;nom&#x27; -a&quot; (be.soft-CUST) &#x27;is soft&#x27;.

=== Vowels ===

Atong has six vowel qualities occurring in the native vocabulary as well as in loanwords: . In addition, there are four long vowels which are only found in loanwords from English and Indic languages. These are usually pronounced longer than the indigenous vowels: /iː/ , /eː/ , /aː/ and /oː/ . In the orthography, long vowels are represented by double letters. Note that /uː/ and /əː/ are not attested.

Examples of minimal pairs and near minimal pairs are given in the table below.

The difference between the loan and the indigenous words is a matter of vowel quality. In closed syllables, where Atong vowels would be pronounced lowered and more retracted, the loan vowels will have the same quality as the Atong vowels in open syllables. Not all loan words that have long vowels in the source language have long vowels in Atong, and not all loans that can be pronounced with a long vowel in Atong have a long vowel in the source language.

===Syllable structure===
The canonical syllable structure of Atong is (C)V(C), where C stands for any consonant and V for any vowel. This structure can be maintained if words like &quot;mai&quot; &#x27;rice&#x27;, &quot;askui&quot; &#x27;star&#x27; and &quot;chokhoi&quot; &#x27;fishing basket&#x27; are analysed as containing a vowel and a final glide (see glide (linguistics)). The glide, presented by the letter i, is the coda of the syllable rather than an element of the nucleus. In phonemic writing the words would look like this: /maj/, /askuj/, /t͡ɕokʰoj/.

There are two glides in the language: /w/ and /j/. The glide /w/ occurs in both syllable initial and syllable final position, e.g. &quot;wak&quot; &#x27;pig&#x27; and &quot;saw&quot; &#x27;rotten, fermented&#x27; respectively. The glide /j/ occurs only syllable finally, e.g. &quot;tyi&quot; /təj/ &#x27;water&#x27;. Traditional words with the structure CVVC do not exist, e.g. *&quot;gaut&quot; or *&quot;main&quot; (where the asterisk [*] indicates the non-existence of these words).

If a diphthong is defined as &quot;two vowels that can occur in the nucleus of a syllable&quot;, then Atong has no diphthongs. There are words that are written with two adjacent vowel graphemes or letters, e.g. &quot;mai&quot; &#x27;rice&#x27;, &quot;askui&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;, and &quot;chokhoi&quot; &#x27;fishing basket&#x27;. However, the letter &quot;i&quot; in these words represents a consonant phoneme, viz. the off glide /j/ (see Table 1). The writing system uses the letter &quot;i&quot; in this way because the letters &quot;j&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both used to represent other phonemes.

== Examples ==
Atong has many loanwords from Assamese language, Bengali, Hindi and English. These loanwords can all easily be spelled in Atong orthography using the Latin script (also called the Roman script). Example of loans from English are: &quot;redio&quot; (from the English word &#x27;radio&#x27;), &quot;rens&quot; (from the English word &#x27;wrench&#x27;), &quot;skul&quot; (from the English word &#x27;school&#x27;), &quot;miting&quot; (from the English word &#x27;meeting&#x27;). Other examples of loanwords are &quot;chola&quot; (from Assamese: চোলা /sʊla/ &#x27;jacket, tunic, coat&#x27;) and &quot;jama&quot; (from Assamese জামা /jāmā/ &#x27;coat, shirt, blouse jacket&#x27;).

<doc id="716765" wikidata="Q831681" url="?curid=716765" title="Wild rice">
<text>Wild rice, also called manoomin, mnomen, psíŋ, Canada rice, Indian rice, or water oats, is any of four species of grasses that form the genus Zizania, and the grain that can be harvested from them. The grain was historically and is still gathered and eaten in North America and, to a lesser extent, China, where the plant&#x27;s stem is used as a vegetable.

Wild rice is not directly related to domesticated rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot; and &quot;Oryza glaberrima&quot;), although both belong to the same botanical tribe Oryzeae. Wild-rice grains have a chewy outer sheath with a tender inner grain that has a slightly vegetal taste.

The plants grow in shallow water in small lakes and slow-flowing streams; often, only the flowering head of wild rice rises above the water. The grain is eaten by dabbling ducks and other aquatic wildlife.

== Species ==
Three species of wild rice are native to North America:
* Northern wild rice (&quot;Zizania palustris&quot;) is an annual plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America, the aquatic areas of the Boreal Forest regions of Northern Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada and Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Idaho in the US.
* Southern or annual wild rice (&quot;Z. aquatica&quot;), also an annual, grows in the Saint Lawrence River, the state of Florida, and on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.
* Texas wild rice (&quot;Z. texana&quot;) is a perennial plant found only in a small area along the San Marcos River in central Texas.
One species is native to Asia:
* Manchurian wild rice (&quot;Z. latifolia&quot;; incorrect synonym: &quot;Z. caduciflora&quot;) is a perennial native to China.

Texas wild rice is in danger of extinction due to loss of suitable habitat in its limited range and to pollution. The pollen of Texas wild rice can only travel about 30 inches away from a parent plant. If pollen does not land on a receptive female flower within that distance, no seeds are produced. Manchurian wild rice has almost disappeared from the wild in its native range, but has been accidentally introduced into the wild in New Zealand and is considered an invasive species there.

The genomes of northern and Manchurian wild rices have been sequenced. There appears to be a whole-genome duplication after the genus split from &quot;Oryza&quot;.

== Culinary use==
The species most commonly harvested as grain are the annual species: &quot;Zizania palustris&quot; and &quot;Zizania aquatica.&quot; The former, though now domesticated and grown commercially, is still often gathered from lakes in the traditional manner, especially by indigenous peoples in North America; the latter was also used extensively in the past. The stems and root shoots also contain an edible portion on the interior.

=== Use by Native Americans ===
Native Americans and others harvest wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles/sticks called &quot;knockers&quot; or &quot;flails&quot;, so as to thresh the seeds into the canoe.

One person vans (or &quot;knocks&quot;) rice into the canoe while the other paddles slowly or uses a push pole. The plants are not beaten with the knockers, but require only a gentle brushing to dislodge the mature grain. Some seeds fall to the muddy bottom and germinate later in the year. The size of the knockers, as well as other details, are prescribed in state and tribal law. By Minnesota statute, knockers must be at most diameter, long, and weight.

Several Native American cultures, such as the Ojibwe, consider wild rice to be a sacred component of their culture. The Ojibwe people call this plant , meaning (commonly translated ). In 2018, the White Earth Nation of Ojibwe granted certain rights (sometimes compared to rights of nature or to granting it legal personhood), including the right to exist and flourish; in August 2021, the Ojibwe filed a lawsuit on behalf of wild rice to stop the Enbridge Line 3 oil sands pipeline, which puts the plant&#x27;s habitat at risk.

Tribes that are recorded as historically harvesting &quot;Zizania aquatica&quot; are the Dakota, Menominee, Meskwaki, Ojibwe, Cree, Omaha, Ponca, Thompson, and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago). Native people who utilized &quot;Zizania palustris&quot; are the Ojibwe, Ottawa/Odawa and Potawatomi. Ways of preparing it varied from stewing the grains with venison stock and/or maple syrup, making it into stuffings for wild birds, or even steaming it into sweets like puffed rice, or rice pudding sweetened with maple syrup. For these groups, the harvest of wild rice is an important cultural (and often economic) event. The &quot;Omǣqnomenēwak&quot; tribe were named by the neighboring Ojibwa after this plant. Many places in Illinois, Indiana, Manitoba, Michigan, Minnesota, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Wisconsin are named after this plant, including Mahnomen, Minnesota, and Menomonie, Wisconsin; many lakes and streams bear the name &quot;Rice&quot;, &quot;Wildrice&quot;, &quot;Wild Rice&quot;, or &quot;Zizania&quot;.

=== Commercialisation ===
Because of its nutritional value and taste, wild rice increased in popularity in the late 20th century, and commercial cultivation began in the U.S. and Canada to supply the increased demand. In 1950, James and Gerald Godward started experimenting with wild rice in a one-acre meadow north of Brainerd, Minnesota. They constructed dikes around the acre, dug ditches for drainage, and put in water controls. In the fall, they tilled the soil. Then, in the spring of 1951, they acquired of seed from Wildlife Nurseries Inc. They scattered the seed onto the soil, diked it in, and flooded the paddy. Much to their surprise, since they were told wild rice needs flowing water to grow well, the seeds sprouted and produced a crop. They continued to experiment with wild rice throughout the early 1950s and were the first to officially cultivate the previously wild crop.

In the United States, the main producers are California and Minnesota (where it is the official state grain), and it is mainly cultivated in paddy fields. In Canada, it is usually harvested from natural bodies of water; the largest producer is Saskatchewan. Wild rice is also produced in Hungary and Australia. In Hungary, cultivation started in 1989.

=== Manchurian wild rice ===
Manchurian wild rice (), gathered from the wild, was once an important grain in ancient China. It is now very rare in the wild, and its use as a grain has completely disappeared in China, though it continues to be cultivated for its stems.
The swollen crisp white stems of Manchurian wild rice are grown as a vegetable, popular in East and Southeast Asia. The swelling occurs because of infection with the smut fungus &quot;Ustilago esculenta&quot;. The fungus prevents the plant from flowering, so the crop is propagated asexually, the infection being passed from mother plant to daughter plant. Harvest must be made between about 120 days and 170 days after planting, after the stem begins to swell, but before the infection reaches its reproductive stage, when the stem will begin to turn black and eventually disintegrate into fungal spores.

The vegetable is especially common in China, where it is known as &#x27; () or &#x27; (). In Japan it is known as &#x27; (). Other names which may be used in English include coba&quot; and water bamboo&quot;&#x27;. Importation of the vegetable to the United States is prohibited in order to protect North American species from the smut fungus.

=== Nutrition ===

Wild rice is relatively high in protein, the amino acid lysine and dietary fiber, and low in fat. Nutritional analysis shows wild rice to be the grain second only to oats in protein content per 100 calories. Like true rice, it does not contain gluten. It is also a good source of certain minerals and B vitamins. One cup of cooked wild rice provides 5% or more of the daily value of thiamin, riboflavin, iron, and potassium; 10% or more of the daily value of niacin, vitamin B6, folate, magnesium, phosphorus; 15% of zinc; and over 20% of manganese.

=== Safety ===
Wild rice seeds can be infected by the highly toxic fungus ergot, which is dangerous if eaten. Infected grains have pink or purplish blotches or growths of the fungus, from the size of a seed to several times larger.

== Archaeology of Minnesota wild rice ==

===Food source===
Anthropologists since the early 1900s have focused on wild rice as a food source, often with an emphasis on the harvesting of the aquatic plant in the Lake Superior region by the Anishinaabe people, also known as the Chippewa, Ojibwa and Ojibwe. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Bureau of American Ethnology published &quot;The Wild Rice Gatherers in the Upper Great Lakes: A Study in American Primitive Economics&quot; by Albert Ernest Jenks in 1901. In addition to his fieldwork interviewing members of various tribal communities, Jenks examined the accounts of explorers, fur traders and government agents from the early 1600s to the late 1800s to detail an &quot;aboriginal economic activity which is absolutely unique, and in which no article is employed not of aboriginal conception and workmanship&quot;. His study further notes wild rice&#x27;s importance in the fur-trading era because the region would have been nearly inaccessible if not for the availability of wild rice and the ability to store it for long periods of time. Wild rice&#x27;s social and economic importance has continued into present times for the Anishinaabe and other north woods tribal members despite the availability of more easily obtainable food sources.

===Processing by various cultures===
The continued use of wild rice from ancient to modern times has provided opportunities to examine the plant&#x27;s processing by various cultures through the archaeological record they left behind during their occupation of seasonal ricing camps. Early ethnographic reports, tribal accounts and historical writings also inform archaeological research in the human use of wild rice. For example, geographer and ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft in the mid-1800s wrote about depressions in the ground on the shore of a lake with wild rice growing in the water. He wrote that wild rice processors placed animal hides in the holes, filled them with rice and stomped on the rice to thresh it. These jigging pits are part of the husking needed to process wild rice, and archaeologists see these holes in the soil stratigraphy in archaeological excavations today. Such historical records from the post-contact period in the Lake Superior region focus on Anishinaabe harvesting and processing techniques. Archaeological investigations of wild rice processing from the American era, before and after the creation of federal Indian reservations, also provide information on the loss of traditional harvesting areas, as 1800s fur trader and Indian interpreter Benjamin G. Armstrong wrote about outsiders &quot;who claimed to have acquired title to all the swamps and overflowed lakes on the reservations, depriving the Indians of their rice fields, cranberry marshes and hay meadows&quot;.

Despite the close association of the Anishinaabe and wild rice today, indigenous use of this food for subsistence also predates their arrival in the Lake Superior region. The Anishinaabe today were part of a larger Algonquian group who left eastern North America on a centuries-long journey to the west along the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes. The Anishinaabe migration story details a vision to follow a giant clam shell in the sky to a place where the food grows on the water. This journey ended between the late 1400s and early 1600s in the Lake Superior wild rice country when they encountered the plant.

===Prehistory===

Archaeological and other scientific investigations have focused on the prehistoric exploitation of wild rice by humans, including: 1) the Anishinaabe, 2) so-called proto-Anishinaabe who may have later transformed into this culture from an earlier form, 3) other indigenous groups who exist today such as the Sioux people, and 4) archaeological-categorized cultures from the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods whose living lineages today are more difficult to identify. A seminal 1969 archaeological study indicated the prehistoric nature of indigenous wild rice harvesting and processing through radiocarbon dating, putting to rest argument made by some European-Americans that wild rice production did not begin until post-contact times. Researchers tested clay linings of thermal features and jigging pits associated with parching and threshing of the plant.

But a more precise dating of the antiquity of human use of wild rice and the appearance of the plant itself in lakes and streams have been the subjects of continuing academic debates. These disputes may be framed around these questions: When did wild rice first appear in various areas of the region? When was it plentiful enough to be harvested in quantities to be a significant food source? What is the relationship of wild rice to the introduction of pottery and to increases in indigenous populations in the past 2,000 years? &quot;The use of wild rice by and its influence on prehistoric people in northeast Minnesota has led to much argument among archaeologists and paleoecologists&quot;.

As an example, archaeologists divide human occupation of northeast Minnesota into numerous time periods. They are: the Paleo-Indian period from 7,000 years ago (5000 BC) extending back to an uncertain time after the glaciers receded from the last Ice Age; the Archaic period from 2,500 to 7,000 years ago (5000–500 BC); the Initial Woodland period from 2,500 to 1,300 years ago (500 BC–700 AD); the Terminal Woodland period from 1,300 to 400 years ago (700–1600 AD); and the historical period after that time. These rough dates are open to debate and vary by location in the state.
In general, two lines of inquiry have focused on archaeological wild rice: 1) The radiocarbon dating of charred wild rice seeds or the associated charcoal left behind during the parching stage of rice production, and 2) Examination of preserved wild rice seeds associated with specific prehistoric pottery styles found in excavations of processing sites. Different pottery styles in northern Minnesota are linked to certain times in the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods stretching from around 500 BC to the time of contact between indigenous peoples and Europeans. To place this in context, &quot;Although ceramics may have appeared as early as 2,000 BC in the southeastern United States, it is about 1,500 years later that they became evident in the Midwest&quot;. After European contact, indigenous wild rice processors generally abandoned ceramic vessels in favor of metal kettles.

===Woodland period===

The Initial Woodland period in northeast Minnesota marks the beginning of the use of pottery and burial mound building in the archaeological record. The Initial Woodland also experienced an increase in indigenous population. One hypothesis is that wild rice as a food source was related to these three developments.
An example of a northeast Minnesota wild rice location, the Big Rice site in the Superior National Forest, considered a classic Initial and Terminal Woodland period type site, illustrates the methods of archaeological investigations into the plant&#x27;s use by humans through time. Archaeological techniques along with ethnographic records and tribal oral testimony, when taken together, suggest use of this particular lakeside site since 50 BC.

On its own, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of wild rice seeds and charcoal samples from the Big Rice itself indicated indigenous use of this site dating to 2,050 years ago.
Furthermore, all excavation levels that solely contained ceramics only used during the Initial Woodland period (known as Laurel pottery complex) also included wild rice seeds. This indicated the use of wild rice during the Initial Woodland period, according to the study.

Excavators have documented more than 50,000 pottery shards from the site from the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods. Specifically, researchers analyzed ceramic rimsherds of Laurel pottery from the Initial Woodland period and Blackduck, Sandy Lake and Selkirk pottery styles from the Terminal Woodland period. Each pottery type had wild rice seeds associated with it in the soil layers of archaeological deposits. These soil layers were not contaminated with pottery from other eras.

This suggests intensive exploitation of the site for wild rice processing through these time periods by different cultures. For example, archaeologists often associate Sandy Lake pottery with the Sioux people, who were later displaced by the Anishinaabe and possibly other Algonquian migrants. Archaeologists often associate Selkirk pottery with the Cree people, an Algonquian group.

An examination of the pollen sequence at Big Rice indicates that wild rice existed in &quot;harvestable quantities&quot; 3,600 years ago during the Archaic period. This date is 1,600 years before the AMS radiocarbon date of human-processed charred wild rice seeds at the site during the Initial Woodland period, although there is no archaeological evidence of human use of the wild rice at the site that far back in time as of yet.

<text>Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection is a 1995 collection of stories and essays by American writer Isaac Asimov. The stories, which comprise the volume&#x27;s first half, are short pieces which had remained uncollected at the time of the author&#x27;s death. &quot;Cal&quot; describes a robot that wishes to write, and the title story &quot;Gold&quot; expresses both Asimov&#x27;s admiration of &quot;King Lear&quot; and his thoughts on cinema adaptations of his own stories. The story &quot;Gold&quot; won a Hugo Award.

<text>New Frankley in Birmingham is a civil parish in Birmingham, England. As such, it has its own parish council.

==History==
New Frankley was established in 2000 in an area in the south-west of the city south of Bartley Reservoir (map), transferred from Bromsgrove (and thus also from Hereford &amp; Worcester to the West Midlands County) in 1995, which had previously been part of the Frankley parish.

==Description==
The parish borders Frankley parish in Bromsgrove District to the north, the unparished area of Birmingham to the east, the unparished area of Rubery to the south, and Romsley parish to the west. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 7,890.

==Frankley Beeches==
In 1930, Frankley Beeches, &quot;a prominent viewpoint 800 ft above sea level&quot;, a small wood or beech copse from which the old Bournville factory was visible, was given by the Cadbury company to the National Trust in memory of Richard and George Cadbury.

<doc id="716779" wikidata="Q39111" url="?curid=716779" title="Nifedipine">
<text>Nifedipine, sold under the brand name Procardia among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, and premature labor. It is one of the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby&#x27;s lung function and provide time for transfer of the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. It is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast- and slow-release formulations.
Common side effects include lightheadedness, headache, feeling tired, leg swelling, cough, and shortness of breath. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure and heart failure. Nifedipine is considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Nifedipine was patented in 1967, and approved for use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 151st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions. 
==Medical uses==

===High blood pressure===
The approved uses are for the long-term treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour diuretics and ACE inhibitors, although calcium channel antagonists, along with thiazide diuretics, are still favoured as primary treatment for patients over 55 and black patients.

Nifedipine given as sublingual administration has previously been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed on an as-needed basis to patients taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This was found to be dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual administration of nifedipine promotes a hypotensive effect via peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a &quot;steal phenomenon&quot; in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, in 1985 the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and effectiveness of sublingual nifedipine for the management of hypertensive emergencies, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor effective. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury.

===Early labor===
Nifedipine has been used frequently as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It also has benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulfate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference was found in the rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, while data on longer-term outcomes is lacking.

===Other===
Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon is often treated with nifedipine. A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine.

Topical nifedipine has been shown to be as effective as topical nitrates for anal fissures.

Nifedipine is also used in high-altitude medicine to treat high altitude pulmonary edema.

Nifedipine is one of the main choices for the treatment of Prinzmetal angina due to its vasodilating effects on the coronary arteries.

Other uses include painful spasms of the esophagus such as from cancer or tetanus. It is also used for the small subset of people with pulmonary hypertension.

Finally, nifedipine can be used in the treatment of renal calculi, which are commonly referred to as kidney stones. Studies have indicated that it helps to relieve renal colic. However, alpha blockers (such as tamsulosin) have been described as being significantly better.

==Side effects==
Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine.

Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.

As calcium channel blocker, nifedipine has a risk of causing gingival hyperplasia.

==Overdose==
A number of persons have developed toxicity due to acute overdosage with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal investigation following death. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range.

==Mechanism of action==
Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. Although nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are commonly regarded as specific to the L-type calcium channel, they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels.

Nifedipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.

==History==
Nifedipine (initially BAY a1040, then Adalat) was developed by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s.

In 1980, Ahmed Hegazy and Klaus-Dieter Rämsch submitted their invention on extended release formulation that became known as &quot;Adalat retard&quot;. Marketed as &quot;Adalat CC&quot; in US, a 1995 US lawsuit found that Pfizer&#x27;s Procardia XL was also based on Bayer&#x27;s Adalat European and US patents.

The use of nifedipine and related calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in response to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with coronary artery disease who took nifedipine. This study was a meta-analysis, and demonstrated harm mainly in short-acting forms of nifedipine (that could cause large fluctuations in blood pressure) and at high doses of 80 mg a day and more.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
In India, nifedipine is manufactured by JB Chemicals, and comes in brands Nicardia Retard (Nifedipine 10 mg, 20 mg tablets) and Nicardia XL 30/60, which are Nifedipine Extended Release tablets.

In Switzerland, nifedipine is sold only as a generic version of extended release formulation, under the names Nifedipin Mepha and Nifedipin Spirig.

<text>Batam, officially the City of Batam (, not to be confused with &quot;Batam Kota&quot;, a district within this city), is the largest city in the Indonesian province of Riau Islands. The city administrative area covers three main islands of Batam, Rempang and Galang (collectively called Barelang), as well as Bulang to the west and several smaller islands. Batam Island is the core urban and industrial zone, while both Rempang Island and Galang Island maintain their rural character and low-density population; they are connected to Batam Island by short bridges. Bulang Island and the islands to its north forming Belakang Padang District lie to the west of Batam Island but are also administratively within the city. Batam is an industrial boomtown, an emerging transport hub and part of a free trade zone in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle, located off Singapore&#x27;s south coast.

According to Statistics Indonesia&#x27;s 2020 census, Batam had a municipal population of 1,196,396, making it the third largest city in the region of Sumatra, after Medan and Palembang. It is the closest part of Indonesia to Singapore, at a minimum distance of 5.8 km across the Singapore Strait. Batam was the fastest-growing municipality in Indonesia during the decade prior to 2010, with a population growth rate of 11% per year; however, there were setbacks during the subsequent decade. In 2017, the island suffered severe job losses; some 300,000 workers were laid off. The official estimated population as of mid-2023 was 1,256,610 (comprising 636,280 males and 620,340 females).

== History ==

The first recorded inhabitants at Batam Island are Malays known as Orang Laut, from the year 231 AD. The island group once served as the field of struggle of Admiral Hang Nadim, against Portuguese invaders in the 16th century, and was utilised by the Indonesian government in the 1960s, who maintained a petroleum logistics base on Sambu Island, one of the minor islands in the Batam group of islands.

In the 1970s, according to Presidential Decree No. 41/1973, Batam Island was designated as a working environment of an industrial area supported by &quot;Batam Island Industrial Development Authority&quot; or better known as &quot;Batam Authority Board&quot; (&quot;BOB&quot;, now &quot;Batam Development Board&quot; ( or &quot;BP Batam&quot;) as the driving force for the development of Batam, with the initial aim of making Batam the &quot;Indonesian version of Singapore&quot;. With the rapid development of the island, based on Government Regulation No. 34/1983, the Batam District (which is part of Riau Islands Regency) was upgraded to municipality status which has the duties to run government administration and society and support the development of &quot;BP Batam&quot;.

In the Indonesian Reformation era in the late 1990s, with Act No. 53/1999, the Batam administrative municipality changed its status to an autonomous region, namely Batam City Government to carry out governmental and developmental functions by involving &quot;BP Batam&quot;.

Batam is a roughly oval island with many bays, islets, and peninsulas, located west of Bintan Island, south of Singapore, north of Rempang Island and Galang Island, and east of Bulang Island. The Singapore Strait separates Singapore and Batam, while the Riau Strait separates Batam and Bintan island. Batam Municipality covers 3,869 km2, of which 1,034.73 km2 is land, a figure which includes some land reclamation. However, &quot;Barelang Island&quot; (not actually one but three, see above) covers roughly 715 km2 of that 1,034.73 km2, and Batam island itself covers only about 410 km2 out of the total. The bulk of the municipal population resides on Batam Island.

===Climate===
Batam has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

== Governance ==
=== Mayor ===
The Batam city government takes care of all population administration and civil registration as well as human resources. The current mayor is Muhammad Rudi who has served since 2016, accompanied by Amsakar Ahmad as deputy mayor.

=== Batam Development Board (BP) ===
The Agency for Free Trade Zone and Free Port of Batam, often abbreviated as BP Batam, is a government nonstructural body under the Chairmanship of the Board of Regions (DK) Batam Central Government, which is chaired by a Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs. BP Batam plays a role in land governance and investment in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Batam.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Batam city is divided into twelve districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) – which include several adjacent islands such as Bulang to the west, and Rempang and Galang to the south, as well as Batam Island itself. Batam Island is connected by bridges to Rempang and Galang, and this group is thus often known by the abbreviation of &quot;Barelang&quot;. The districts are tabulated below with their areas, 2010 census populations and 2020 census populations, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the number of administrative villages within each district, all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;, and its postal codes.

Notes:
* (a) comprises 116 islands to the west of Batam Island.
* (b) comprises 70 islands to the southwest of Batam Island
* (c) comprises 82 islands to the south of Batam Island, including Galang Island and Rempang Island.
* (d) comprises the east part of Batam Island, but also includes 23 islands off the eastern shore.
* (e) includes 14 islands off the coast of Batam Island.

== Demographics ==
At the 2020 census, Batam had a population of 1,196,396 inhabitants. The population was increasing rapidly, with a population growth rate of more than 8% per year between 2001 and 2012, but the increase has subsequently slowed.

=== Ethnicity ===
Today, Batam is inhabited by a heterogeneous mixture of people due to labor migration and desire to be close to Singapore; it is very diverse, two-thirds of the population are migrants. The predominant ethnicities are Malays, Javanese, Batak, Minangkabau and Chinese. As a municipality it exemplifies the national motto of &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot; (Unity in Diversity). The location of Batam, which is close to Singapore, is conducive to the development of economic, sociopolitical, and cultural aspects of the local community.

=== Religion ===
Islam is the majority religion in Batam, followed by Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism. Most of those who follow Islam are Javanese, Malays and Minangkabaus. The Great Mosque of Batam, located in the city center adjacent to the main square, the mayor&#x27;s office and the provincial Parliament, is an important symbol of Islamic religious life in Batam. Christianity is also widely embraced by the people of Batam, especially those from the Batak and Nias people of North Sumatra (Protestantism) and migrants from Flores island in Nusa Tenggara Timur province, East Indonesia (Roman Catholicism) as well as Javanese Catholics from Yogyakarta and Central Java who emigrated to this province along with a minority of Chinese Indonesians and internal migrant Indian Indonesians from Medan, North Sumatra. The majority of the Chinese population practises Buddhism. A number of Viharas are located in Batam, of which Vihara Duta Maitreya is one of the most frequented, and is the largest Vihara in Southeast Asia with an area of 4.5 hectares. In addition, Hinduism in practiced by a quarter of its small ethnic Indian Indonesian minority as well as by its Balinese emigrant minority ethnic populace who migrated from the tourist island of Bali and are resident for business purposes in this city.

=== Language ===
Indonesian is the common lingua franca of Batam in daily use. Other languages such as local Malay (similar to the Malaysian standard as spoken in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore) since both varieties coexist with each other as the former is the official and national language widely spoken and used like in the rest of Indonesia whilst the latter is a trade language and widely spoken by Malaysian Malay expatriates from Johor, Malaysia as well as Malay Singaporeans from Singapore who reside for business purposes and also for historical purposes. Other ethnic minority languages such as Minangkabau, Batak, Javanese and Chinese ethnic dialects like Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew and Hainanese are also widely used owing to the city&#x27;s ethnolinguistic diversity in addition to the dominant ethnic Malay populace. The usage of Mandarin and English are trending due to Singaporean influence, especially by expatriates living in Batam.

== Economy ==

Based on Presidential Decree No. 41/1973, the Batam Industrial Development Authority (BP Batam) was established to manage 415 square kilometers of industrial complex in Batam City for heavy industry. Previously only Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company, settled there with only 6,000 inhabitants.
Shipbuilding and electronics manufacturing are important industries on the island. Being located close to the ports of Singapore, the speed of goods shipping and product distribution is increased, benefiting the island&#x27;s economy. With lower labor costs and special government incentives, it is the site of many factories operated by foreign companies.

Under a framework signed in June 2006, Batam, along with parts of neighbouring Bintan and Karimun, are a part of a Special Economic Zone with Singapore; this zone eliminates tariffs and value-added taxes for goods shipped between Batam and Singapore. In 2007, Law No. 44 was enacted to supplement Law No. 36/2000 in establishing Batam as a free trade zone for 70 years. BP Batam still manages the industrial complex. And in 2016, the responsibility of industrial complex changed from the governor of Riau Islands Province to the Office of the Coordinating Economic Minister as per Presidential Decree No. 8/2016.

=== Tourism ===

Over 1.5 million tourists visited the city in 2015. Batam is the third-busiest entry port to Indonesia next to Bali and Jakarta. In 2014, around 58.8% of foreign tourists came from Singapore, 12.8% from Malaysia and 4.2% from South Korea. Popular tourism spots in Batam include the Maha Vihara Duta Maitreya Temple, shopping malls (including Grand Batam Mall, Mega Mall Batam Centre, Nagoya Hill Shopping Centre, etc), Jabal Arafah Mosque and the Barelang Bridge.

=== Foreign Investment ===
In the first semester of 2023, the value of foreign investment reached US$1.2 billion, while domestic investment was recorded at US$168 million. Most of the foreign investment came from Singapore. Foreigners are allowed to buy apartments with limited leases but not landed homes in Indonesia. In 2021, a group of Singaporeans were forcibly evicted after their 30-year property leases expired in Sekupang.

== Transport ==

=== Ferry ===
Ferries connect Batam to Singapore, Bintan, and Johor Bahru (Malaysia). Five ferry terminals are on the island: Batam Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal, Nongsapura Ferry Terminal, Sekupang, Waterfront City and Batam Center Ferry Terminal. Connections to Singapore are by way of Harbourfront and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminals run by Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC).

The most recent incident happened on 29 November 2015 when a ferry, &#x27;Sea Prince&#x27;, hit floating object(s) while en route to Singapore from Batam and began leaking. A total of 97 passengers were rescued on life rafts.
Signs showing a picture of a raised finger over a pair of lips have been placed in August 2014 at the Batam Centre International Ferry Terminal to request silence while queuing for immigration to hear names being called and clearly hear instructions given by the immigration officer. Some visitors have been sent back immediately on the first ferry available for flouting this rule. The signs are also applicable at other terminals, but are not strictly enforced.

=== Trans Batam ===

 Trans Batam is the most reliable and the cheapest public transportation in Batam. It began to operate in 2005. Trans Batam is the second BRT system in Indonesia, after Jakarta&#x27;s TransJakarta. The price for one ride is Rp2,000 for students and Rp4,000 for the public. Trans Batam operates from 05:30 to 19:00.

Trans Batam serves nine corridors of route:


=== Taxi ===
 Taxis in Batam are available almost anywhere at ferry terminals, the airport, shopping malls, hotels, etc. More than 3000 taxis are in Batam. In the early 2000s, Batam commonly had Toyota Corolla taxis. Starting in late 2013, more than 95% of taxis are brand new using the Toyota Limo and Chevrolet Lova.

=== Airport ===
Hang Nadim International Airport is Batam island&#x27;s main airport, and has the longest runway of all airports in Indonesia. The airport was the largest airport in the Sumatra region from 1995 to 2012 with a capacity of six million passengers annually, and is now the second-largest in the Sumatra region after Kuala Namu International Airport in Medan, which has a capacity of eight million passengers. The airport has 4 paired jetbridges and 2 single jetbridges. Hang Nadim International Airport is a hub for Lion Air, Batik Air and Citilink. BP Batam, which operates Hang Nadim International Airport, will build a new terminal with a capacity of eight million passengers per year for each terminal (16 million passengers per year in total for two terminals) in late 2016. BP Batam intends to build eight paired jetbridges in the new terminal. Domestic destinations include Pekanbaru, Palembang, Medan, Jakarta, Padang, Surabaya, Bandung, Bandar Lampung, Balikpapan, Yogyakarta, Makassar, and many more. International flights currently include Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (operated by Batik Air Malaysia).

== Environment ==
Due to piling works for touristic activity, sand mining, and logging for charcoal business, only 4.2% of Batam Island is covered in mangrove forests, a great decrease from 24% in 1970. Originally, Batam Island had 41,500 hectares of mangrove forests.

<text>Clovelly () is a privately owned harbour village in the Torridge district of Devon, England. The settlement and surrounding land belongs to John Rous who inherited it from his mother in 1983. He belongs to the Hamlyn family who have managed the village since 1738.

The village, which is built into the wooded sea cliffs of the north Devon shore, has a steep pedestrianised cobbled main street with traditional architecture. Due to the gradients, donkeys (now mostly replaced with sledges) have been used to move goods and cargo from Clovelly Bay. Visitors to the village entering via the visitor centre are required to pay an entrance fee which covers parking, entrance to two museums, Clovelly Court gardens, and an audiovisual history guide. The village is a tourist destination and is host to an annual Lobster and Crab festival.

At the 2011 census, the parish population was 443, a decrease of 50 on the 2001 census. The island of Lundy is part of the electoral ward of Clovelly Bay.

==History==
The area has had human habitation since the Iron Age as there is a hillfort at Windbury Head northwest of the village. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the Manor of Clovelly was acquired by William the Conqueror from its Saxon tenant. It was listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Clovelie&quot;. William would make a gift of the village to his wife Matilda of Flanders.

In the late 14th century, during the reign of Richard II, the Manor of Clovelly was bought by the judge Sir John Cary. The Church of All Saints contains several monuments to the Cary family, who remained the Lords of the Manor for another 400 years. The village remained an agricultural parish until the late 16th century, when the squire, George Cary had the stone breakwater erected creating a harbour. This provided the only safe haven for ships along this stretch of the Devon coast between Appledore and Boscastle. He also erected fish cellars and warehouses at the cliff base and cottages along the banks of the stream that provided the only route to the shore from the plateau above. Cary spent £2,000 turning Clovelly into a fishing village.

The privately owned village has been associated with only three families since the middle of the 13th century. In 1738, the Clovelly Estate was acquired by the Hamlyn family. In 1901, the village had a population of 521. Clovelly&#x27;s preservation owes much to Christine Hamlyn who dedicated herself to renovating and expanding the ancient cottages while beautifying the village.

===Lifeboat station===

The village has had an RNLI lifeboat station since 1870. The boathouse cost £175 to build. Between 1899 and 1931, the lifeboat saved 158 lives.

In 1988, the RNLI closed the station. In response, the villagers operated their own rescue service. In 1998 the RNLI reopened the station. An Atlantic 85-class lifeboat was installed in 2014. It was named in honour of Toby Rundle, an Oxford student who took his own life in 2010.

==Architecture==
Almost all the terraced buildings along the village&#x27;s cobbled street are architecturally listed. More than 50 out of 71 are on the main street itself. Only seven buildings are not listed. The village&#x27;s only Grade I listed building is the Church of All Saints, parts of All Saints&#x27; Church might still have some late Norman. Although its listing summary states, &quot;Virtually all C15 and early C16, restored in 1843 and again in 1884&quot;. The Grade II* buildings are numbers 16, and 45–47, 53–54 (53 has the house name &quot;Crazy Kate&#x27;s&quot;), and 59–61.

==Management==
The Clovelly Estate Company owns all of the buildings in the village and is responsible for maintaining the village and preserving its character. The company is led by John Rous, a descendant of the Hamlyn family who lives at Clovelly Court. John Rous is the only son of Keith Rous, the 5th Earl of Stradbroke, by his second marriage, to Mary Asquith, granddaughter of former prime minister H. H. Asquith. 

As of 2021, Clovelly included approximately &quot;80 cottages, two chapels, two hotels&quot;, woodlands and about 2000 acres of farmland. The village encourages tourism and has been financially successful in that endeavour as of 2019.

==Access==
The village main street is not accessible by motor vehicles.

The lack of vehicular access to the main street has led to deliveries being made by sledge. This is not done as a tourist attraction, but as a matter of practicality. Goods are delivered by being pulled down on a sledge from the upper car park, and refuse is collected by being pulled down the hill to a vehicle at the harbour.

The village is served by Stagecoach bus service 319; the route includes Barnstaple, Bideford and Hartland. The South West Coast Path National Trail runs from the top of the village.

From 2023, a per-person fee was instigated for entry into the village, including the gardens of Clovelly Court and car parking, to fund maintenance of the village. Adult entry costs £9.50 and child entry is £5.50. Children under 7 are free. Dogs must be kept on a lead.

==Notable residents and cultural references==
The 16th century Carys of Clovelly feature in the historical novel &quot;The Grove of Eagles&quot; by Winston Graham.

An 18th century chapbook entitled &quot;The History of John Gregg and his Family of Robbers and Murderers&quot; explains that &quot;Chovaley&quot; (i.e., Clovelly) was once the home of a tribe of fictional cannibalistic bandits. It is alleged that Gregg and his extended family of dozens were eventually tracked down by bloodhounds and were burnt alive in three fires. They were said to have lived in &quot;a cave near the sea-side&quot; and had committed some 1,000 murders. Writer Daniel Codd observes that a stretch of Clovelly Bay is called &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;—&quot;an apt name indeed if there is any truth in the ghoulish story of the Gregg family&quot;.

The surgeon Campbell De Morgan (1811–1876), who first speculated that cancer arose locally and then spread more widely in the body, was born here.

J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s painting of Clovelly Harbour from around 1822 hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin.

The novelist Charles Kingsley lived here as a child from 1831 to 1836, while his father, Rev. Charles Kingsley, served first as senior curate then as rector. Later, in 1855, his novel &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; did much to stimulate interest in Clovelly and to boost its tourist trade.

On Sunday, 28 October 1838 twelve fishing vessels with a total of twenty-six men on board left Clovelly Harbour for the fishing grounds. Only one vessel and its crew ever returned after a ferocious storm in the Bristol Channel. This event led to the founding of the Shipwrecked Mariners&#x27; Society early the following year with the object of:

Local resident Joseph Harvey Jewell and his wife Mary Ann Jewell were two of only ten passengers to survive the wreck of the &quot;General Grant&quot; in 1866.

The charity is active supporting the seafaring community suffering hardship and distress.

Clovelly is also described by Charles Dickens in &quot;A Message from the Sea&quot; and was painted by Rex Whistler, whose cameos of the village were used on a china service by Josiah Wedgwood.

In Susan Coolidge&#x27;s &quot;In the High Valley&quot; (1890), part of the Katy series, a walk into Clovelly is described: 

...–surely a more extraordinary thing in the way of a street does not exist in the known world. The little village is built on the sides of a crack in a tremendous cliff; the &quot;street&quot; is merely the bottom of the crack, into which the ingenuity of man has fitted a few stones, set slant-wise, with intersecting ridges on which the foot can catch as it goes slipping hopelessly down.

Clovelly is mentioned in passing by Rudyard Kipling in &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot; as being located to the west of the boys&#x27; academy.

Actor Joss Ackland and his wife Rosemary bought a property in Higher Clovelly on the outskirts of the village in 1989. Ackland lived there until his death in 2023; Rosemary died in 2002 and is buried in the grounds of their home. Ackland appeared in promotional videos for the town and spoke often of his love of and connection to Clovelly.

In 1973 the film &quot;Malachi&#x27;s Cove&quot; was shot largely at Clovelly.

<text>The Worcester and Birmingham Canal is a canal linking Birmingham and Worcester in England. It starts in Worcester, as an &#x27;offshoot&#x27; of the River Severn (just after the river lock) and ends in Gas Street Basin in Birmingham. It is long.
There are 58 locks in total on the canal, including the 30 Tardebigge Locks, one of the longest lock flights in Europe. The canal climbs from Worcester to Birmingham.

The canal also has connections with the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, and the restored Droitwich Canal, it historically linked to the Dudley Canal Line No 2, until the route through the Lapal Tunnel was abandoned in 1917. 

==History==



The parliamentary bill permitting its construction was passed in 1791 as the &#x27; (31 Geo. 3. c. 59) empowering the company to raise £180,000 (equivalent to £ in ), through 1,800 shares at a cost of £100 each. It also allowed them to raise a further £70,000, if needed, amongst themselves or by the mortgage of tolls and rates. The act also permitted the company to allow landowners on the line to build wharfs and wharfhouse, and if they refuse to, the company are allowed to if needed. A further act of Parliament, the &#x27; (38 Geo. 3. c. xxxi), authorised the raising of £149,929 amongst themselves or through the creation of new shares. However, the company were unable to raise the full amount of money authorised by the second act, and so another, the &#x27; (44 Geo. 3. c. xxxv), was passed allowing them to raise £49,680. Another act, the &#x27; (48 Geo. 3. c. xlix) was passed to obtain more money. This act empowered the company to raise £168,000 through the creation of 4,200 shares at £40 each. A final act, the (55 Geo. 3. c. lxvi), was passed after the company had purchased land for reservoirs, which was not permitted in the previous acts. The act permitted the company to sell the land and to pay a debt of £29,096 (equivalent to £ million in ), to the treasurers by 29 September 1815 as well, otherwise it would be taken out of the proceeds raised from selling the land.

The canal was surveyed by Josiah Clowes and John Snape. Its engineers changed often, and included Thomas Cartwright, John Woodhouse and William Crosley.

Construction of a double barge-width (14 ft) canal began in 1792 from the Birmingham end, but progressed slowly. Selly Oak was reached in October 1795 and Kings Norton Junction by May 1796, meeting the new Stratford-upon-Avon Canal which had by then reached Hockley Heath. By March 1797 the 2726 yard (2493 m) Wast Hills Tunnel was open and the canal was trading to Hopwood. In 1807 the canal reached Tardebigge without the use of locks. From Worcester Bar to Tardebigge top lock, the canal is at the 453 ft Birmingham Level. The cost of building locks was too great so the 56 locks down to Worcester were built to the narrow specification, with the final two locks connecting to the Severn in Worcester being to allow river craft access to Diglis Basin.

The final 16 miles (26 km) was opened in December 1815. Plans to construct basins at Lowesmoor and Diglis were carried out eventually.
The Dudley Canal Line No 2 was built through the Lapal Tunnel to meet the canal at Selly Oak in 1798. After repeated collapses, the tunnel was finally abandoned in 1917 leaving a short stretch navigable between Selly Oak and a brick works at California until 1953, after which it was drained and filled in. A campaign group, The Lapal Canal Trust, is working to restore it, with a diversion around the tunnel.

A major user of the canal was the Cadbury chocolate factories at Bournville and Blackpole, Worcester.

==Birmingham terminus==
For twenty years direct connection to the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) was prevented by the &quot;Worcester Bar&quot;, a physical barrier at Gas Street Basin, Birmingham designed so that the BCN would not lose water to the Worcester and Birmingham. Cargoes had to be laboriously manhandled between boats on either side. In 1815 an Act allowed the creation of a stop lock and the bar was breached. The Worcester and Birmingham raised their water level by six inches to minimise water loss and today the two pairs of lock gates have been removed. There were separate toll offices either side of the bar for the two canal companies. The bar still exists, with boats moored to both sides of it.

The commercial terminus in Birmingham was &quot;Worcester Wharf&quot;, a large complex extending from the bar along Bridge Street, Gas Street and Granville Street. Part of it now forms a water front to The Mailbox shopping and residential complex.

==Birmingham West Suburban Railway==

After the development of the new Birmingham New Street, a group of local business men noticed the resultant need for additional railway capacity south, through what were the under developed suburbs of south Birmingham and villages of northern Worcestershire. They therefore proposed development of a new branch railway, following the route of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal south to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway to allow access to their new station at Kings Norton.

Needing finance for construction of the BWSR, the newly formed Midland Railway became involved in the deal. An eventual agreement was reached with the then loss making canal company, who would be paid a rent for the land, which later became a guarantee of a 1% share dividend. The payments to the canal company and development began in 1873, and the line was running by 1875. 
Originally the railway terminated at Granville Street station and later the Central Goods station and goods yard through a tunnel under the canal, both stations now demolished and built upon.

Today it forms a large part of the southern section of the Cross-City Line which runs in another tunnel under the canal adjacent to the Holliday Street Aqueduct.

==Today==

At Selly Oak, a new aqueduct, the Ariel Aqueduct (named after the former Ariel Motorcycles factory nearby), was constructed in 2011 to carry the canal over a new section of the A38.

The canal is popular for leisure and has narrowboat hire centres at Alvechurch, Worcester, Tardebigge, Dunhampstead and Stoke Prior.

The canal forms part of the Stourport Ring, a popular cruising circuit for holiday boating. The ring takes in parts of four waterways, is long, and includes 105 locks. Another ring which includes the Worcester and Birmingham Canal is the Avon Ring, which is long with 129 locks, and also includes parts of four waterways.

<text>The Lakhmid kingdom ( ), also referred to as al-Manādhirah () or as Banū Lakhm (), was an Arab kingdom that was founded and ruled by the Lakhmid dynasty from to 602. Spanning Eastern Arabia and Southern Mesopotamia, it existed as a dependency of the Sasanian Empire, though the Lakhmids held al-Hira as their own capital city and governed from there independently. The kingdom was a participant in the Roman–Persian Wars, in which it fought as a Persian ally against the Ghassanid kingdom, which was ruled by a rival Arab tribe and existed as a dependency of the Roman Empire. While the term &quot;Lakhmids&quot; has been applied to this kingdom&#x27;s ruling dynasty, more recent scholarship prefers to refer to them as the Naṣrids.

The Nasrid dynasty&#x27;s authority extended over to their Arab allies in al-Baḥrayn (Eastern Arabia) and al-Yamāma. In 602, the Persian king Khosrow II deposed and executed the last Nasrid ruler Al-Nu&#x27;man III and annexed the Lakhmid kingdom, triggering an insurrection by his Arab allies in Najd. The ensuing disorder between anti-Persian rebels and pro-Persian loyalists in the kingdom culminated in the Battle of Dhi Qar, which resulted in a defeat for Arab loyalists and the Persian army, and thereby the end of Persian hegemony over Eastern Arabia. The success of the rebellion and the victory against the Persians at Dhi Qar roused political confidence, enthusiasm, and self-consciousness among the kingdom&#x27;s Arabs.

==Nomenclature and problems of Lakhmid identity==
The nature and identity of the Lakhmid Kingdom remains mostly unclear. The ruling Nasrid family emerges with &quot;Amr of the Lakhm&quot;, mentioned in the late 3rd-century Paikuli inscription among the vassals of the Sasanian Empire. From this, the term &quot;Lakhmid&quot; has been applied by historians to the Nasrids and their subjects, ruled from al-Hirah. However, as historian Greg Fisher points out, there is &quot;very little information about who made up the people who lived in or around al-Hirah, and there is no reason to suppose that any connection between Nasrid leaders and Lakhm that may have existed in the third century was still present in the sixth, or that the Nasrids ruled over a homogeneous Lakhmid kingdom&quot;. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the historical sources—mostly Byzantine—start dealing with the Lakhmids in greater detail only from the late 5th century, as well as by the relative lack of archaeological work at al-Hirah.

==History==

=== Founding ===
The Lakhmid Kingdom was founded and ruled by the Banu Lakhm tribe that emigrated from Yemen in the second century. The founder of the dynasty was &#x27;Amr, whose son Imru&#x27; al-Qais I (not to be confused with the poet Imru&#x27; al-Qais who lived in the sixth century) is claimed to have converted to Christianity. However, there is debate on his religious affinity. Theodor Nöldeke noted that Imru&#x27; al-Qays ibn &#x27;Amr was not a Christian, while Irfan Shahîd noted a possible Christian affiliation, suggesting that Imru&#x27;al Qays&#x27; Christianity may have been &quot;orthodox, heretical or of the Manichaean type&quot;. Furthermore, Shahid asserts that the funerary inscription of Imru&#x27; al Qays ibn &#x27;Amr lacks Christian formulas and symbols.

Imru&#x27; al-Qais dreamt of a unified and independent Arab kingdom and, following that dream, he seized many cities in the Arabian Peninsula. He then formed a large army and developed the Kingdom as a naval power, which consisted of a fleet of ships operating along the Bahraini coast. From this position he attacked the coastal cities of Iran – which at that time was in civil war, due to a dispute as to the succession – even raiding the birthplace of the Sasanian kings, Fars province.

Imru&#x27; al-Qais escaped to Bahrain, taking his dream of a unified Arab nation with him, and then to Syria seeking the promised assistance from Constantius II which never materialized, so he stayed there until he died. When he died he was entombed at al-Nimarah in the Syrian desert.

Imru&#x27; al-Qais&#x27; funerary inscription is written in an extremely difficult type of script. Recently there has been a revival of interest in the inscription, and controversy has arisen over its precise implications. It is now certain that Imru&#x27; al-Qais claimed the title &quot;King of all the Arabs&quot; and also claimed in the inscription to have campaigned successfully over the entire north and centre of the peninsula, as far as the border of Najran.

=== Lakhmid–Persian alliance and Roman–Persian Wars ===
Two years after his death, in the year 330, a revolt took place where Aws ibn Qallam was killed and succeeded by the son of Imru&#x27; al-Qais, &#x27;Amr. Thereafter, the Lakhmids&#x27; main rivals were the Ghassanids, who were vassals of the Sasanians&#x27; arch-enemy, the Roman Empire. The Lakhmid Kingdom could have been a major centre of the Church of the East, which was nurtured by the Sasanians, as it opposed the Chalcedonian Christianity of the Romans.

==== Rupturing of the alliance, Arab rebellion, and Muslim conquest ====
The Lakhmids remained influential throughout the sixth century. Nevertheless, in 602, the last Lakhmid king, al-Nu&#x27;man III ibn al-Mundhir, was put to death by the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II because of a false suspicion of treason, and the Lakhmid Kingdom was annexed.

Coupled with increasing instability in Persia proper after the downfall of Khosrow in 628, these events heralded the decisive Battle of Qadisiyya in 636 and the Muslim conquest of Persia. Some believed that the annexation of the Lakhmid Kingdom was one of the main factors behind the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the Muslim conquest of Persia as the Sasanians were defeated in the Battle of Hira by Khalid ibn al-Walid. At that point, the city was abandoned and its materials were used to reconstruct Kufa, its exhausted twin city.

According to the Arab historian Abu ʿUbaidah ( 824), Khosrow II was angry with the king, al-Nu&#x27;man III ibn al-Mundhir, for refusing to give him his daughter in marriage, and therefore imprisoned him. Subsequently, Khosrow sent troops to recover the Nu&#x27;man family armor, but Hani ibn Mas&#x27;ud (Nu&#x27;man&#x27;s friend) refused, and the Arab forces of the Sasanian Empire were defeated at the Battle of Dhi Qar, near al-Hirah, the capital of the Lakhmids, in 609. Hira stood just south of what is now the Iraqi city of Kufa.

==Family tree and descended nobility==

===Lakhmid rulers===
===Abbadid dynasty===
The Abbadid dynasty, which ruled the Taifa of Seville in al-Andalus in the 11th century, was of Lakhmid descent.

==In literature==

Poets described al-Hira as paradise on earth; an Arab poet described the city&#x27;s pleasant climate and beauty thus: &quot;One day in al-Hirah is better than a year of treatment&quot;. The ruins of al-Hirah are located south of Kufa on the west bank of the Euphrates.

<text>The Pucikwar language, A-Pucikwar, is an extinct language of the Andaman Islands, India, formerly spoken by the Pucikwar people on the south coast of Middle Andaman, the northeast coast of South Andaman, and on Baratang Island. It belonged to the Great Andamanese family.

==History==
As the colonization and settlement process of the Andaman Islands intensified from the late 19th century and into the 20th century, the indigenous Great Andamanese groups were greatly reduced in number and became alienated from their traditional territories. The few surviving Great Andamanese soon lost the cultural and linguistic distinctions among them that were present at the onset of the 19th century, when at least ten distinct tribal and linguistic groups were recorded.
By the 1901 census, the Pucikwar were reduced to 50, but distinctions between tribal groups and subgroups had become considerably blurred (and some intermarriage had also occurred with Indian and Karen (Burmese) settlers). 
The Pucikwar tribe disappeared as a distinct group sometime after 1931.

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are agglutinative languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a distinctive noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the tongue. An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of &quot;yop&quot;, &quot;pliable, soft&quot;, in Aka-Bea: 
*A cushion or sponge is &quot;ot-yop&quot; &quot;round-soft&quot;, from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A cane is &quot;ôto-yop&quot;, &quot;pliable&quot;, from a prefix for long things.
*A or pencil is &quot;aka-yop&quot;, &quot;pointed&quot;, from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen tree is &quot;ar-yop&quot;, &quot;rotten&quot;, from the prefix for limbs or upright things.
Similarly, &quot;beri-nga&quot; &quot;good&quot; yields:
*&quot;un-bēri-ŋa&quot; &quot;clever&quot; (hand-good).
*&quot;ig-bēri-ŋa&quot; &quot;sharp-sighted&quot; (eye-good).
*&quot;aka-bēri-ŋa&quot; &quot;good at languages&quot; (tongue-good.)
*&quot;ot-bēri-ŋa&quot; &quot;virtuous&quot; (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

Body parts are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say &quot;head&quot; alone, but only &quot;my, or his, or your, etc. head&quot;.

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
&#x27;This&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; are distinguished as &quot;k-&quot; and &quot;t-&quot;.

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers — one and two — and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.

<text>In mathematics, quantales are certain partially ordered algebraic structures that generalize locales (point free topologies) as well as various multiplicative lattices of ideals from ring theory and functional analysis (C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras). Quantales are sometimes referred to as &quot;complete residuated semigroups&quot;.

==Overview==
A quantale is a complete lattice formula_1 with an associative binary operation formula_2, called its multiplication, satisfying a distributive property such that

:formula_3

and

:formula_4

for all formula_5 and formula_6 (here formula_7 is any index set). The quantale is unital if it has an identity element formula_8 for its multiplication:

:formula_9

for all formula_10. In this case, the quantale is naturally a monoid with respect to its multiplication formula_11.

A unital quantale may be defined equivalently as a monoid in the category Sup of complete join-semilattices.

A unital quantale is an idempotent semiring under join and multiplication.

A unital quantale in which the identity is the top element of the underlying lattice is said to be strictly two-sided (or simply &quot;integral&quot;).

A commutative quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is commutative. A frame, with its multiplication given by the meet operation, is a typical example of a strictly two-sided commutative quantale. Another simple example is provided by the unit interval together with its usual multiplication.

An idempotent quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is idempotent. A frame is the same as an idempotent strictly two-sided quantale.

An involutive quantale is a quantale with an involution

:formula_12
that preserves joins:

:formula_13

A quantale homomorphism is a map formula_14 that preserves joins and multiplication for all formula_15 and formula_6:

:formula_17

:formula_18

<doc id="716817" wikidata="Q748613" url="?curid=716817" title="Instow">
<text>Instow is a village in north Devon, England. It is on the estuary where the rivers Taw and Torridge meet, between the villages of Westleigh and Yelland and on the opposite bank to Appledore. There is an electoral ward with the same name. The ward&#x27;s total population at the 2011 census was 1,501.

There is a small river beach and sand dunes, that home some rare species of orchid including the pyramidal orchid.

The Tarka Trail passes through Instow, providing an easy means for people to arrive on foot or by bike. This section of the Trail is also part of the South West Coast Path, offering longer walks along the coast.

The village is served by the Church of St John the Baptist, which has 13th- or 14th-century origins and is a Grade I listed building. A chapel of ease, All Saints, was built in 1936 and is now also used as a community centre.

==History==
Instow is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having two ploughlands and of meadow, pasture and woodland. The name of Instow derives from Anglo-Saxon of &quot;St John&#x27;s Holy Place&quot;, which would have been &quot;Johnstow&quot;, or &quot;Jonestow&quot;. The suffix &quot;Stow&quot;, denotes a holy place in the Anglo-Saxon language, and the name is found in many places across Devon which had a church (Churchstow, Christow, Virginstow). The original settlement was on the high ground opposite the more modern site of the village low against the riverside. This is where the 14th century Church of St John the Baptist is located, near to the Instow Community Primary School.

The parish was formerly in the hundred of Fremington, some north-east of Bideford, and west of Barnstaple. In 1889, a directory described the village as being from London, and on &quot;the high road from Bideford to Barnstaple.&quot;

Before the arrival of the railway in 1855, the village was quite small consisting of two sets of cottages, one by Lane End, and the other set next to the quay. The quay was built , and is a Grade II listed structure. The village hall, which was built in 1911, was formerly known as &quot;Rifle Hall&quot;, as it was used to train soldiers on rifle drills for the First World War. Military training in the Second World War included practise D-Day landings with walls built into the dunes near to Instow. These were removed quite quickly after the war had ended.

==Instow Railway Station==

The line opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848, and then passenger trains ran from Barnstaple to Bideford from 2 November 1855 after the Bideford Extension Railway reached and a station was built at Instow. The line was further extended to Torrington in 1872. Passenger services ceased on 2 October 1965 although ball clay traffic continued until 1982.

Instow has a famous railway signal box, which is over 130 years old and was the UK&#x27;s first Grade II listed signal box. It used to control the signals at Instow Station and also the operation of the level crossing. You can see the wheel that operated the gates, pull the signal levers, one of which still operates a signal, and generally learn how the box worked. In 2003 the box was nationally recognised for its restoration and educational value by receiving the Carillion Rail Award at the National Railway Heritage Awards. The signal box is now managed and run by volunteers of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and is open to the public on occasional Sundays and Bank Holidays.

==Instow Beach==

Instow Beach also known as Instow Sands, is used widely during summer months at the peak of the tourist season. The beach is suitable for families as it enjoys few waves because of the sandbanks at the mouth of the estuary cancelling out most of the ocean swell. However, bathing water quality has regularly failed Environment Agency mandatory standards over the last few decades.

There is a large number of boats anchored on the sand. Many are only accessible at low-tide or via a dinghy or what is locally known as a tender. Windsurfing and kite surfing have become popular, taking advantage of the open position and calm waters. Canoeing and kayaking in the rivers to Instow beach is also popular.

===Leading lights===

In 1820 a pair of leading lights was established at Braunton Burrows to help guide vessels entering the Taw Torridge Estuary from Bideford Bay. Designed by Joseph Nelson, they were known as the Bideford High and Low Lights. When the ground they were on became unstable they were demolished (in 1957) and replaced by a new pair of leading lights at Instow. Initially the rear light was supported on a tubular steel structure (since replaced by a steel lattice structure) and the front light on a wooden structure, which was irreparably damaged in a storm in January 1990 and likewise replaced by a steel lattice tower. Both lights remain operational and are managed by Trinity House.

==RM Instow==
Near the village is RM Instow, a military installation operated by the Royal Marines; the main unit which uses the camp is No. 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron.

== Governance ==
The parish and built-up area had a population of 786 at the 2011 Census, which had dropped to 706 by the time of the 2011 Census. The ward had a population of 1,501 in 2011. The area is represented at Parliament under the North Devon.

==Notable people==
*John Harmer (1857–1944), Bishop of Rochester, died in Instow
*Leonard Slater (1875–1914), English cricketer and British Army officer was born in Instow
*John Durnford-Slater (1909–1972), British Army officer credited with raising the first Army commando unit during the Second World War
*Robin Durnford-Slater (1902–1984), Royal Navy Admiral who went on to become the last Commander-In-Chief, The Nore 
*David Shepherd (1940–2009), English cricketer and umpire
* Norah Simpson (1895–1974), Australian modernist artist, died at Crossways, Instow.

Instow features prominently in the 1919 novel &quot;Last of the Grenvilles&quot; by Frederick Harcourt Kitchin (under his pseudonym, Bennett Copplestone)

==Bus services==
Instow is served by frequent Stagecoach services 21/21A between Georgeham/Ilfracombe, Barnstaple, Bideford and Westward Ho!/Appledore daily. These connect at Barnstaple with trains to Exeter and buses towards Exeter and Tiverton and at Bideford with buses towards Okehampton, Holsworthy and Hartland. Instow is also served by Stagecoach service 5B between Barnstaple, Bideford, Torrington, Winleigh, Crediton and Exeter and National Express coach services to London, Heathrow Airport, Taunton, Bristol and Birmingham.

==Ferry service==

During summer a ferry service operates across the Torridge estuary from Instow Quay to Appledore slipway. The service runs two hours either side of high tide. Aimed both at locals and users of the Tarka Trail / South West Coast Path this has been operated in recent times as a not-for-profit service on days when water levels in the estuary have been high enough.

<doc id="716825" wikidata="Q7925326" url="?curid=716825" title="Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV">
<text>The Gundlach Periscope, usually known under its British designation as Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV, was a revolutionary invention by Polish engineer Rudolf Gundlach, manufactured for Polish 7TP tanks from the end of 1935 and patented in 1936 as the &quot;Peryskop obrotowy Gundlacha&quot;. It was the first device to allow the tank commander to have a 360-degree view from his turret with a single periscope. By rotating the periscope and allowing the tank commander to look backwards through the second eyepiece, he no longer had to change position to look behind the turret. Early tanks had small turrets and fixed seating, without an independently rotating cupola, and so the commander wasn&#x27;t easily able to move himself to another rear-facing periscope.

On 14 June 1935 it was officially adopted by the Polish Army, as reversible periscope G wz. 34. The design was first used in the TKS tankette, then in 7TP light tank. Shortly before the war it was given to the British and was used in almost all tanks of WWII, including the British Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, and Cromwell and the American M4 Sherman. After the German and Soviet attack and fall of Poland in 1939 it was copied entirely from captured 7TP and TKS Polish tanks and later used by the Soviets for their tanks (including the T-34 and T-70).

As a part of Polish-British pre-war military cooperation, the patent was sold for one zloty to Vickers-Armstrong. It was produced as the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV (pictured), and built into all British tanks (Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, Cromwell). After the fall of Poland, Germany, USSR and Romania captured some equipment, allowing them to copy the invention. In USSR the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 (harking to the British designation, as Russian sources openly confirm that it was copied from samples acquired with British-supplied tanks) and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). At the end of World War II this technology was adopted throughout the world and used basically unchanged for almost 50 years, until it was replaced by electronic devices.

<doc id="716836" wikidata="Q30348" url="?curid=716836" title="Jensen Motors">
<text>Jensen Motors Limited was a British manufacturer of sports cars and commercial vehicles in West Bromwich, England. Brothers Alan and Richard Jensen gave the new name, Jensen Motors Limited, to the commercial- and sports car body-making business of W J Smith &amp; Sons Limited in 1934. It ceased trading in 1976. Though trading would resume in 1998, Jensen Motors Limited was dissolved on 30 July 2011.

Jensen Motors built specialist car bodies for major manufacturers alongside vehicles of their own design using engines and mechanicals sourced from major manufacturers Ford, Austin and Chrysler.

The rights to Jensen&#x27;s trademarks were bought with the company and it briefly operated in Speke, Liverpool, from 1998 to 2002. Under subsequent owners, a new version of the Jensen Interceptor was announced in 2011. It was planned to bring manufacture of that new model back to the former Jaguar motor plant in Browns Lane, Coventry.

==Jensen brothers==
In 1926 young Alan Jensen (1906-1994) and his brother Richard Jensen (1909-1977) built a new boat-tailed sporting body on one of the first Chummy baby Austins. It was seen by Alfred Herbert Wilde (1891–1930), chief engineer of Standard Motor Company. He persuaded Alan Jensen to join New Avon Body Co, a Standard Motor associate and under Wilde&#x27;s aegis Alan Jensen designed the first Standard Avon open two-seaters produced from 1929 to 1933. He went on to design two more cars for Avon then moved with his brother Richard to Austin dealers Edgbaston Garage Limited, Bournbrook, in a building still standing next to the University of Birmingham campus. Edgbaston Garage, a car servicing business, had been bought for his son in 1929 by J A M Patrick&#x27;s father. Young Joe Patrick, involved in all fields of motor sport, was setting up a coachbuilding operation. For his Edgbaston Garage the Jensen brothers made handsome bodies for the new Wolseley Hornet and Hornet Special chassis. To the concern of the brothers their cars were widely advertised as The Patrick Special and so in 1931 the brothers moved again. Edgbaston Garage became Patrick Motors Limited.

The Jensen brothers had gone to work for lorry body maker W J Smith &amp; Sons in Carters Green in West Bromwich again to build bodies for small sports cars including more Wolseley Hornet Specials. This was a quite separate development which Smith named on their account Jensen Motors. Their own name was on the product. In 1934 Smith died and the brothers managed to buy a controlling shareholding in Smith &amp; Sons. They later changed the name of W J Smith &amp; Sons to Jensen Motors Limited.

Smith&#x27;s announced an open 4-seater and a lowered 2-seater in May 1931 both to be known as Jensen Wolseley Hornets. They later expanded to build exclusive customised bodies for standard cars produced by several manufacturers of the day including Morris, Singer, Standard, as well as Wolseley. In 1934 they were commissioned by American film actor Clark Gable to design and build a car for him based on a Ford V-8 chassis. The resultant car won them much acclaim and stimulated huge interest in their work, including a deal with Ford to produce a run of Jensen-Fords with Jensen bodywork with a Ford chassis and engine. In 1934 they also started to design their first true production car under the name &quot;White Lady&quot;. This evolved into the Jensen S-type which went into production in 1935.

==Commercial vehicles==

In the late 1930s Jensen diversified into the production of commercial vehicles under the marque JNSN, including the manufacture of a series of innovative lightweight trucks, built with unrestricted aluminium alloys, for Reynolds Tube and the prototype for the articulated &quot;Jen-Tug&quot; which went into production in the late 1940s.

During the Second World War Jensen concentrated on the war effort and produced components for military vehicles including the turrets for tanks, and on the production of specialised ambulances and fire-engines.

After the war production of the &quot;Jen-Tug&quot; thrived and Jensen also produced a new range of &quot;JNSN&quot; lightweight diesel trucks and chassis which were used for a variety of vehicles including pantechnicons and buses. A handful of Jensen buses and coaches were produced for independent operators into the 1950s, with Perkins diesel engines, David Brown gearboxes, and bodywork by a variety of bodybuilders of the time, which had the distinctive large JNSN marque cut into the sheet metal on the front of the bus, below the windscreen. In the 1950s Jensen were chosen by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) to build the bodies for the four-wheel-drive Austin Gipsy. In 1958 they built a small number of Jensen Tempo light commercial vans, pick-ups and minibuses, a German original design, built under licence in the UK, Chassis number 5 that was the 1958 commercial motor-show vehicle, fitted with a Ruthmann cherry picker, is the only known survivor and is currently being restored.

==Sports cars==

Production of cars ceased during the war years, but by 1946 a new vehicle was offered, the Jensen PW (a luxury saloon). Few were produced since raw materials were carefully limited by the new government&#x27;s central planning. Also in 1946 body designer Eric Neale joined Jensen Motors from Wolseley and his first project was the more modern coupé which followed in 1950, named the Interceptor, which was built until 1957.

In 1955, Jensen started production of Neale&#x27;s masterpiece, the 541, which used the then-revolutionary material of fibreglass for its bodywork. The radiator grille was covered by an unusual driver-controlled swivelling flap.

The 541S was replaced by another Neale design, the C-V8 in October 1962, which replaced the Austin-sourced straight-6 of the previous cars with a 6-litre American Chrysler V8. This large engine in such a lightweight car made the Jensen one of the fastest four-seaters of the time.

For its eventual replacement, the Interceptor, Jensen turned to the Italian coachbuilder, Carrozzeria Touring, for the body design, and to steel for the material. First displayed alongside the production C-V8 FF in October 1965 and put into production in the second half of 1966 the bodyshells themselves were built by Vignale of Italy and later by Jensen. The same Chrysler wedge-head powerplant was used in the earlier cars with the later cars moving to the in engine. The Interceptor was offered in fastback, convertible and (rare) coupé versions. The fastback was by far the most popular with its large, curving wrap-around rear window that was hinged for access to the storage area, making the Jensen an early form of liftback.

===FF — All wheel drive and ABS===

The Jensen Motors stand at the October 1964 Earls Court Motorshow displayed a Jensen FF car equipped with all wheel drive and ABS as publicised but not displayed in February 1964. At the following Show in October 1965 a production ready CV-8 FF was displayed, priced almost 50 per cent more than the standard car and three inches longer. However, it remained a prototype and instead the Interceptor-based Jensen FF entered production in 1966. The FF is apparently externally identical to the Interceptor, although it was four inches longer in the bonnet (all ahead of the windscreen) and it had a second row of air vents behind the front wheels.

The extra letters stood for &quot;Ferguson Formula&quot;, Ferguson Research being the inventor of the full-time all wheel drive system adopted, the first on a production sports car. Also featured was the Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock braking system in one of the first uses of ABS in a production car.

Just 320 FFs were constructed and production ceased in 1971.

==Other projects==

Austin A40 Sports: As one in a series of collaborations between Austin and Jensen, the Austin A40 Sports originated when Austin&#x27;s chairman Leonard Lord, upon seeing the Interceptor, requested that Jensen, and their designer Eric Neale, develop a body that could use the A40 mechanicals.

The resulting body-on-frame A40 Sports – which debuted at the 1949 London Motor Show – had been designed by Eric Neale, an ex-Wolseley stylist who had joined Jensen in 1946. During production, the A40 Sports&#x27; aluminium bodies were built by Jensen and transported to Austin&#x27;s Longbridge plant for final assembly. The A40 Sports had been intended as more of a sporty touring car and not a sports car per se, and over 4000 examples were manufactured from 1951 to 1953.

Austin-Healey 100: Although Jensen&#x27;s design for a new Austin-based sports-car was rejected by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1952 in favour of a design provided by Donald Healey, Jensen did win the BMC contract to build the bodies for the resultant Austin-Healey 100 and the rest of the &quot;big Healey&quot; cars. At the end of 1960 Austin-Healey cars occupied about 350 of the 850 men in Jensen&#x27;s factory.

Volvo P1800: In 1960 Jensen won a contract from Volvo to assemble and finish the bodies for their P1800 coupé. Pressed Steel manufactured the body-shells at their Linwood plant in Scotland and shipped them to Jensen in West Bromwich to be finished, painted and trimmed and made ready for distribution. The first batch for evaluation came off the production line in May 1961. The engine and gearbox were from Sweden, the back axle from USA and the electrical system from Germany, otherwise the car was all British. By March 1962 1,100 men were busy in Jensen&#x27;s West Bromwich works making Austin-Healey bodies and Volvo and Jensen cars. By 1963 the contract was ended early due to quality concerns and P1800 production was moved to Gothenburg, Sweden.

Sunbeam Tiger: In the early 1960s Jensen was also involved in the development and production of the Sunbeam Tiger.

==Jensen-Healey==

Jensen was bought by Norcros Limited, &quot;an industrial holding company&quot; in June 1959. Alan Jensen retired from the positions of joint managing director and alternate chairman in October 1964 though he remained on the board. Richard Jensen &quot;relinquished&quot; his appointment as joint managing director in November 1965 but remained chairman. Following disagreements Alan and Richard Jensen resigned from the board in 1966. Richard retired to Malta and died back in London in September 1977. Alan died in Brighton in 1994.

In September 1967 Jensen announced they had been hit by the US car safety regulations which were going to come into force the following January. They expected there would have to be many redundancies resulting from the drop in demand for the Austin-Healey 3000 and Sunbeam Tiger though both had been modified to meet the regulations. At the end of the year they advised their shareholders that Austin-Healey and Sunbeam Tiger contracts had now ended. An American management consultant, Carl Duerr, replaced the chief executive. It was decided that from now on Jensen Motors would be a full-time car manufacturer. In mid 1968 following a disastrous 1967 year Norcros decided to sell their automotive subsidiary whose products &quot;cost about the same as small houses&quot;. Current production rate was 12 Interceptors and FFs a week. In 1968 it was bought by a merchant bank William Brandts.

The Norwegian-American West Coast car distributor Kjell Qvale became the majority shareholder in 1970 and brought in Donald Healey who was appointed chairman in April 1970 and they brought in a new chief executive in May. They were able to announce the new Jensen-Healey in March 1972. By the end of May the next year 3,356 of the new cars had been manufactured but the factory&#x27;s performance disappointed the owner and sales volume was mediocre.

In October 1974 Kjell Qvale appointed himself chief executive as well as chairman. Production was cut back from 25 to 12 a week to match sales. A Jensen GT was announced in July 1975, a Jensen-Healey with a coupé/estate body then the business&#x27;s future came under threat which meant redundancy for 700 workers – two thirds of its workforce.

A receiver was appointed by the Bank of America in September. Kjell Qvale laid great emphasis on the part played by the unions in bringing about the downfall of the business. The financial pundits said that in his attempt to mass-produce a small sports car Qvale installed production capacity far in excess of market demand. The empty premises were auctioned off in mid-August 1976.

Two new companies: Jensen Special Products (JSP) and Jensen Parts &amp; Service Limited (JP&amp;S) were created to pick up the pieces of Jensen Motors. JSP was created as a specialist engineering and design business from Jensen&#x27;s development department. JP&amp;S was created to provide parts and service to the existing Jensen customer base. JP&amp;S then turned into a company called International Motors, who gained the UK franchise for Subaru and Maserati, as well as Hyundai from 1982. Both JSP and JP&amp;S were bought by a holding company, Britcar Holdings. In 1982 JP&amp;S, with the rights to use the Jensen brand names, was sold to Ian Orford who put the Interceptor back into production as the Mk IV.

Jensen Parts and Service was renamed Jensen Cars Limited and an average 11 cars were made every month during the 1980s always in small numbers before the company was sold to Unicorn Holdings of Stockport and a Mk V Interceptor was proposed but never materialised although a few more Mk IVs were built.

==Brief revival==

A revival in 2001 was short lived. By the end of 2002 production on their only model – the £40,000 S-V8 – had ceased.

After a £10 million investment, with contributions from Liverpool City Council and the Department of Trade and Industry, a two-seater convertible, the Jensen S-V8, had been launched at the 1998 British International Motor Show, with an initial production run of 300 deposit paid vehicles planned at a price of £40,000 each, but by October 1999 it was confirmed that 110 orders had been placed.

The new Liverpool factory in Speke commenced production in August 2001 but troubles with manufacture meant production ceased with only 20 leaving the factory and another 18 cars left partially completed. The company went into administration in July 2002. The Jensen name and partially completed cars were later sold to SV Automotive of Carterton, Oxfordshire, in 2003 who decided to complete the building of 12 of the cars, retaining the others for spare parts, and finally selling them for £38,070.

===Jensen International Automotive===
In April 2010 Jensen International Automotive (JIA) was founded. This new company will buy old Jensen Interceptors, and sell them as new cars after a complete restoration, with new engine and interior trim.

In September 2011 CPP, a specialist sports car manufacturer announced they were planning to make a new Jensen, expected to go on sale to the public sometime in 2014. The new Interceptor was to be based around an all-aluminium chassis and to feature alloy panels, &quot;echoing the four-seat grand tourer layout of the much-loved original&quot;, according to the official press release.

===The Jensen Group===
On the 25 February 2015, Autocar published a report stating that the Jensen name was officially being revived with two models expected by 2016. The first model, shown in clay on the same article, showed a vehicle called the Jensen GT. This model was to be built in bespoke numbers and cost around £350,000 outside the UK. Also in 2016, Jensen was expected to launch the successor to the famous Jensen Interceptor, called the Interceptor 2. These revival announcements were completely different from those announced by CPP in 2011 and were &quot;officially sanctioned&quot; by the company leading the project, &quot;The Jensen Group&quot;, who claimed they have established complete ownership over the Jensen marque. The interim Jensen GT was to be produced under an agreement between the Jensen Group and Jensen International Automotive, a small British company that builds modified Interceptor R models. As of 2023, no more news of this venture has materialized.

<text>Aari (also rendered &quot;Ari&quot;, &quot;Ara&quot;, &quot;Aro&quot;, &quot;Aarai&quot;) is an Omotic language spoken by the Aari people in the South Omo Zone of Ethiopia.

Dialects are Bako, Biyo (Biya), Laydo, Seyki, Shangama, Sido, Wubahamer, Zeddo.

==History==
The Aari people suffered considerable pressures to assimilate after the conquest of the Omo River region by the Ethiopian Empire in the late 1800s, which resulted in the widespread adoption of the Amharic language there. Nevertheless, the Aari language survived; today, many Aari are also fluent in Amharic.

==Current status==

Aari had a population of 285,000 first language speakers in 2007, of whom 129,350 were monolingual. 13,300 second language users were also recorded in 2007. The ethnic population was 289,835 as of 2007.

Aari is used at home and at local markets. The size of the Aari tribe is growing, and thus the Aari language has seen an increase in language use and development in recent years. The language is learned by all of the Aari people and some members of neighboring tribes as well. Many Aari speakers also use Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.

Although it is widely spoken by Aari people, literacy in the language is low. An orthography has been developed and rolled out in local schools; today, all schools in the two districts where it is spoken teach Aari writing and literature as a subject. An Aari-English-Amharic dictionary has also been published. A translation of the New Testament into Aari was published in 1997.

==Dialects==
There are nine dialects of the Aari language, each dialect being associated with a former chiefdom. While these dialects are mutually intelligible with one another, some also have distinct features.

The following are dialects of Aari. Alternate names are given in parentheses.

*Bako (Baco)
*Biyo (Bio)
*Gayil (Galila)
*Laydo
*Seyki
*Shangama
*Sido
*Wubahamer (Ubamer)
*Zeddo

== Phonology ==
* Stop sounds /p b/ can have allophones as fricatives [ɸ β].
* /ʋ/ can also be heard as labio-velar [w].
Aari has two tones, high and low.

==Grammar==
Aari is a subject-object-verb language (SOV), meaning that the English sentence &quot;the cow (subject) ate (verb) the grass (object)&quot; would translate back from Aari as &quot;cow (subject) grass (object) ate (verb).&quot;

===Verbs===
In Aari, the suffix -&quot;sis&quot; can be applied to the stem of most verbs with a causative meaning. Doing so will increase the verb&#x27;s valency. When applied to an intransitive verb, it will make the verb transitive. For example, the intransitive verb stem &quot;daqal-&quot; &quot;become bad&quot; with the marker -&quot;sis&quot; becomes &quot;daqalsis-&quot;, is transitive and has the causative meaning &quot;make bad&quot;. The transitive verb &quot;kam-&quot; &quot;pick up&quot; with -&quot;sis&quot; becomes &quot;kamsis-&quot;, is trivalent and has the meaning &quot;cause to pick up&quot;.

=== Example verb conjugation ===
Verb stem &quot;buruk&quot;, meaning &quot;boil.&quot;

The causative stem of &quot;buruk-&quot; is &quot;burukš-&quot;, making this verb irregular.

&quot;To boil&quot; is &quot;burukinti.&quot; This consists of the stem &quot;buruk&quot; with the infinitive (also called the verbal noun suffix) &quot;-inti.&quot;

The causative third-person singular perfect (past tense) of &quot;burukinti&quot; is &quot;búrukse&quot; (&quot;it boiled&quot;).

The present tense is &quot;búrukše&quot;, &quot;he boils [something].&quot;

A sentence can be formed with the verb &quot;buruk&quot; by adding a noun as an object (something being boiled). &quot;Búrukše...&quot; means &quot;he boiled...&quot;, so &quot;he boiled water&quot; would be &quot;noqá búrukše&quot;.

Note that in Aari the object comes before the verb; &quot;búrukše noqá&quot; is not correct.

==Orthography==

Aari uses a Latin script and an Ethiopic script, but below 10% of Aari speakers can read. Schooling is not well developed in this region of the world, so Aari is mostly spoken rather than written down and most speakers have no use for the language&#x27;s two writing systems. However, despite this, there are schools in numerous villages and there are efforts to promote education and literacy. At present, 8% of second language users are literate in Aari.

The New Testament was translated into Aari in 1997. Additionally, some other books have been translated into Aari to help promote literacy; Genesis Exodus, 1 &amp; 2 Samuel, 1 &amp; 2 Kings, Esther, Ruth, Psalms, Leviticus, Joshua and Judges have all been translated into Aari, but at present only Genesis has been published. Some external organizations are working with Aari churches to write a complete Aari Bible and increase the literacy rate.

<text>Delivery is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. Cargo (physical goods) is primarily delivered via roads and railroads on land, shipping lanes on the sea, and airline networks in the air. Certain types of goods may be delivered via specialized networks, such as pipelines for liquid goods, power grids for electrical power and computer networks such as the Internet or broadcast networks for electronic information. Car transport is a particular subgroup; a related variant is Autorack, which involves the transport of autos by railroads.

Delivery is a fundamental component of commerce and trade, and involves transport and distribution. The general process of delivering goods is known as distribution, while the study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called logistics. Firms specializing in delivering commercial goods from the point of production or storage to their point of sale are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as delivery services. Postal, courier, and relocation services also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.

== Consumer goods delivery ==
Most consumer goods are delivered from a point of production (such as a factory or farm) through one or more points of storage (warehouses) to a point of sale (such as retail stores or online vendors), where the consumer buys the good and is responsible for its transportation to point of consumption. There are many variations on this model for specific types of goods and modes of sale. Products sold via catalogue or the Internet may be delivered directly from the manufacturer or warehouse to the consumer&#x27;s home, or to an automated delivery booth. Small manufacturers may deliver their products directly to retail stores without warehousing.

Some manufacturers maintain factory outlets which serve as both points of storage and points of sale, selling products directly to consumers at wholesale prices, although many retail stores falsely advertise as factory outlets. Building, construction, landscaping and like materials are generally delivered to the consumer by a contractor as part of another service. Some highly perishable or hazardous goods, such as radioisotopes used in medical imaging, are delivered directly from manufacturer to consumer.

Home delivery is often available for fast food and other convenience products, e.g. pizza delivery. Sometimes home delivery of supermarket goods is possible. A milk float is a small battery electric vehicle (BEV), specifically designed for the delivery of fresh milk. A new form of delivery is emerging on the horizon of the internet age: delivery by the crowd. In this concept, an individual not necessarily contracted by the vendor performs the delivery of goods to the destination. Sometimes, private courier companies will also deliver consumer goods on a regular basis for companies like E-commerce businesses. In the 2010s and 2020s, a number of companies started using gig workers driving their own vehicles rather than permanent employees driving company vehicles to make deliveries of groceries, food, and general retail items. Drivers typically sign up and get work assignments using a smartphone app. Arrangements range from producers and deliveries made by separate companies (such as with Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub) to in-house deliveries only (such as Amazon Flex, although Amazon also uses contracted delivery companies in Amazon-branded vehicles), to a mixture (such as Walmart Spark, which delivers both Walmart and third-party products).

== Delivery vehicles ==

The consumer demand for supermarkets to deliver to their door created the need for a mixed temperature controlled vehicle on 3.5T chassis. These vehicle bodies were initially built with the traditional GRP sandwich panels but as more damage resistant lightweight materials with better insulation properties have become available companies have been developing Advanced Home Delivery Vehicles. The 2012 Commercial Vehicle Show in the UK saw the new JDC PolyBilt design, one of the latest of these &quot;Plastic&quot; bodies that can be recycled at the end of its service life, unlike the traditional GRP which ends up as landfill.

Vehicles are often specialized to deliver different types of goods. On land, semi-trailers are outfitted with various trailers such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers and other specialized trailers, while railroad trains include similarly specialized cars. Armored cars, dump trucks and concrete mixers are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, merchant ships come in various forms, such as cargo ships, oil tankers and fishing boats. Freight aircraft are used to deliver cargo.

Often, passenger vehicles are used for delivery of goods. These include buses, vans, pick-ups, cars (e.g., for mail or pizza delivery), motorcycles and bicycles (e.g., for newspaper delivery). A significant amount of freight is carried in the cargo holds of passenger ships and aircraft. Everyday travelers, known as a casual courier, can also be used to deliver goods. Delivery to remote, primitive or inhospitable areas may be accomplished using small aircraft, snowmobiles, horse-drawn vehicles, dog sleds, pack animals, on foot, or by a variety of other transport methods.

New methods of delivery, such as delivery robots and delivery drones, have been introduced. Larger firms including Amazon, Google, and FedEx have been investing in using delivery drones that are capable of carrying light packages across short distances. Such firms may also use a Delivery Driver App to plan efficient routes to help ensure they deliver items on time.

== Periodic deliveries ==
Some products are delivered to consumers on a periodic schedule. Historically, home delivery of many goods was much more common in urban centres of the developed world. At the beginning of the 20th century, perishable farm items such as milk, eggs and ice, were delivered weekly or even daily to customers by local farms. Milkmen delivered milk and other farm produce. With the advent of home refrigeration and better distribution methods, these products are today largely delivered through the same retail distribution systems as other food products. Icemen delivered ice for iceboxes until the popularization of home refrigerator rendered them obsolete in most places. Similarly, laundry was once picked up and washed at a commercial laundry before being delivered to middle-class homes until the appearance of the washing machine and dryer (the lower classes washed their own and the upper classes had live-in servants). Likewise deliveries of coal and wood for home heating were more common until they were replaced in many areas by natural gas, oil, or electric heating. Some products, most notably home heating oil, are still delivered periodically. Human blood may be delivered to hospitals on a periodic schedule. Milk delivery continued until the mid-twentieth century across North America. For example, the last milk delivery by horse-and-wagon in Edmonton was in 1961. Milkman jokes continue in circulation long after. Related lines of Jeannie C. Riley&#x27;s 1968 hit song &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; say:&quot;There&#x27;s old Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he&#x27;s asked me for a date,And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he&#x27;s away.&quot;
