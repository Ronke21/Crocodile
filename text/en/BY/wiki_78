<doc id="716148" wikidata="Q6565784" url="?curid=716148" title="List of Canadian electoral districts (1871–1872)">
<text>This is a list of electoral districts or &quot;ridings&quot; in Canada from 1871 to 1872, according to the British North America Act. No elections were held at this time, except to elect new members from Manitoba which joined confederation in 1870. New seats were added in 1872 as British Columbia had joined Confederation as a province the year before, with special byelections being called to fill the seats and temporary seatnames until the general election. Of these, only two seats (New Westminster District and Vancouver) were contested, the others being filled by acclamation.

Electoral districts are constituencies that elect members of Parliament in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons every election.

<doc id="716151" wikidata="Q14947449" url="?curid=716151" title="Bank of Athens">
<text>The Bank of Athens (, ), colloquially known as Athinaiki, was a Greek bank based in Athens, Greece, from where it took its name. Founded in 1893 and long affiliated with France&#x27;s Banque de l&#x27;Union Parisienne (BUP), it was Greece&#x27;s second-largest bank in the mid-20th century behind the National Bank of Greece (NBG). It expanded in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean until merging with the NBG in 1953. Its brand was briefly revived in Greece during the 1990s, and separately survived until 2019 in a former South African subsidiary.

==Overview==


In 1893, , A. Lambrinoudis, A. Kallergis, M. Lordanopoulos, and N. Triantafyllidis founded the Bank of Athens backed by Greek, French, and English capital. The bank opened for business in 1894. In 1895, it established branches in London, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Khartoum.

In 1896 international financier Ioannis Pesmazoglou sold his private bank to the Bank of Athens and became the latter&#x27;s chairman, also providing the bank with a branch in Alexandria. In 1904, he forged an alliance with the Banque de l&#x27;Union Parisienne, under which the BUP became a small shareholder of the Bank of Athens and became its main source of international refinancing.

In August 1906, the Bank of Athens purchased the Industrial Credit Bank (, ), which had operated in Athens since 1873. The Industrial Credit Bank had offices in Istanbul and possibly in Smyrna. By 1910, the Bank of Athens had opened branches in Crete (Chania, Heraklion, and Rethymno), and in Trabzon and Samsun on the Black Sea Region of Turkey. By 1911, it also had branches in Greece in Agrinio, Kalamata, Karditsa, Larissa, Piraeus, Tripoli, Volos, and Ermoupoli on the island of Syros; in the European part of the Ottoman Empire in Ioannina, Kavala, Salonica, Serres, Xanthi, and on the island of Chios and Vathy, Samos; in Ottoman Asia in Adana, Giresun, Mersin and Tarsus; in Egypt in Alexandria, Cairo, Beni Suef, Mansoura, Mit Ghamr, Tanta, Zagazig, as well as Port Sudan; and in Limassol and Hamburg. It survived financial stress during the Balkan Wars with support from the BUP and the NBG, following which French operational control intensified.

In 1921, the Bank of Athens opened an office in New York City. By 1922, the bank had branches throughout Greece, in Limassol and Nicosia, Alexandria, Cairo, Port Said, Galata, Stamboul, Beyoğlu, Edirne, London and Manchester. Despite losing its offices in Constantinople, Edirne and Smyrna in October 1922 following the Greco-Turkish War, the Bank of Athens was by then the second-largest in Greece, a position it kept until its merger in 1953 despite the difficulties generated by the European banking crisis of 1931 which led the BUP in France to near-collapse.

In 1926, the bank&#x27;s New York City office became a subsidiary called the &quot;Bank of Athens Trust Company&quot;. In 1930, the NBG and the Bank of Athens combined their activities in Egypt to form a subsidiary, the National Bank of Greece and Athens (). By the 1930s, the Bank of Athens also had offices in Korçë and Durrës. Throughout the interwar period, the Bank of Athens was widely viewed as aligned with French interests in Greece, whereas its dominant competitor the National Bank of Greece was perceived as representing British capital not least through its longstanding association with London-based Hambros Bank.

In 1941, during the Axis Occupation of Greece, Dresdner Bank assumed oversight of the bank, which entailed operational control even though it did not technically take over its shares out of consideration for Italian sensitivities.

In 1953, the Greek government decided to merge the comparatively sounder Bank of Athens with the then-ailing NBG to form the &quot;National Bank of Greece and Athens&quot;. In New York City, the two banks merged their subsidiaries into the Atlantic Bank of New York. In 1956, the merged entity in Greece again took the name of National Bank of Greece.

==1990s brand revival and integration into Eurobank Ergasias==

In 1964, the NBG acquired a majority stake in a bank originally founded in 1924 as V. Karavasilis Tobacco Company and Bank SA and renamed in 1952 as Professional Credit Bank (). In 1992, NBG renamed the Professional Credit Bank &quot;Bank of Athens&quot; and sold a controlling interest to South Korea&#x27;s Hanwha Group. The latter, however, experienced difficulty following the 1997 Asian financial crisis and subsequently sold its Greek banking operation to EFG Eurobank in 1999. In 2000, the Bank of Athens was fully integrated into the new group which took the name Eurobank Ergasias.

==South African Bank of Athens==

In 1947, the Bank of Athens created a subsidiary to serve the community of Greeks in South Africa. Following the 1953 merger, the South African operation kept the Bank of Athens brand and remained under NBG ownership until being sold in October 2018 to Grobank Limited, a financial group based in Johannesburg. Grobank discontinued the Bank of Athens brand in June 2019, and was in turn acquired by Nigeria-based Access Bank Group in 2021. As a consequence, the former Bank of Athens became part of Access Bank South Africa.

<text>Sarah Louise Christine Chalke (; born August 27, 1976) is a Canadian actress. She is known for her starring roles as the second Becky Conner in the ABC sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1993–1997), Elliot Reid in the NBC/ABC medical comedy series &quot;Scrubs&quot; (2001–2010), Beth Smith and Space Beth in the Adult Swim animated science fiction series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (2013–present), and Kate Mularkey in the Netflix drama series &quot;Firefly Lane&quot; (2021–2023).

Chalke had recurring roles as Stella Zinman in the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2008–2009, 2014) and as Angie in the ABC/TBS sitcom &quot;Cougar Town&quot; (2012). She also had voice roles in the Netflix animated sitcom &quot;Paradise PD&quot; (2018–2021) and the Netflix animated adventure series &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; (2021–2022).

==Early life and education ==
Chalke was born at the Ottawa Civic Hospital on August 27, 1976, in Ottawa, Ontario, and was raised in North Vancouver, British Columbia. She is the middle of three daughters born to Douglas and Angela Chalke (née Piper). 

She is from a German family who spoke German at home, and went to a school where she spoke French all day, so she speaks both languages fluently. 

Chalke graduated from Handsworth Secondary School in North Vancouver in 1994.

==Career==
Chalke&#x27;s acting career began at age eight when she began appearing in musical theatre productions. At 12, she became a reporter on the Canadian children&#x27;s show &quot;KidZone&quot;. In 1993, she took over the role of Rebecca Conner on &quot;Roseanne&quot; after Lecy Goranson left the series; Chalke made a cameo appearance as a different character in the &quot;Roseanne&quot; episode &quot;Halloween: The Final Chapter&quot; (#178, originally aired October 31, 1995) after Goranson returned. Chalke later returned to the role of Becky after Goranson departed for a second time. After the show ended, Chalke returned briefly to Canada, where she starred in the CBC Television drama &quot;Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy&quot; (1998–1999). In 1999, she also starred as a Russian KGB agent in the film &quot;Y2K&quot; (also known as &quot;Terminal Countdown&quot;), alongside Louis Gossett Jr. and Malcolm McDowell.

In 2001, she was cast as Dr. Elliot Reid in the NBC comedy series &quot;Scrubs&quot; and she would be a cast member for all nine seasons until the series ended its run in 2010. She has appeared in several feature films, including &quot;Ernest Goes to School&quot; and &quot;Cake&quot;.
She appeared in Channel 101&#x27;s &quot;The &#x27;Bu&quot; with The Lonely Island, a parody of the hit show &quot;The O.C.&quot;, but was credited as &quot;Pamela Fenton&quot;. In 2007, she appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;, which starred fellow Canadian Ryan Reynolds. In 2008, Chalke became the spokesperson for a line of women&#x27;s underwear by Hanes that included a series of commercials directed by her &quot;Scrubs&quot; co-star Zach Braff. In 2008 and 2009, she made appearances in the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; as Stella Zinman. In early 2011, she starred in the CBS television series &quot;Mad Love&quot;, a romantic comedy which debuted as a midseason replacement and was cancelled after only one season was produced.

Chalke was signed by former &quot;Scrubs&quot; executive producer Bill Lawrence to play the love interest of Bobby Cobb in the series &quot;Cougar Town&quot;. She appeared in multiple episodes in the third season. Chalke starred in the ABC comedy series &quot;How to Live with Your Parents (For the Rest of Your Life)&quot;, which premiered April 3, 2013, and which was cancelled one month later. She played Polly, a single and very uptight divorced mother who found herself moving back in with her parents (Elizabeth Perkins and Brad Garrett) because of the economic downturn. Also in 2013, she played a frantic mother named Casey Hedges in the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; season 9 episode &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot;. Chalke also voices Beth Smith and Space Beth on the Adult Swim animated science-fiction series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;.

On April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of &quot;Roseanne&quot; was in the works, and that most of the original cast and some of the producers would return for the revival series. On May 16, 2017, it was confirmed that eight episodes of the show were greenlit by ABC and would air mid-season in 2018 with Chalke returning, but playing a role other than Becky Conner. Following its cancellation, she later returned for a guest appearance in its spinoff series, &quot;The Conners&quot;.

In February 2021, Chalke co-starred alongside Katherine Heigl in the role of Kate Mularkey for the Netflix series &quot;Firefly Lane.&quot;

==Personal life==
In December 2006, Chalke became engaged to Canadian lawyer Jamie Afifi, after three years of dating. In September 2022, Chalke announced that they had called off the engagement and &quot;separated some time ago&quot;. They have two children together, a son born in December 2009, and a daughter born in May 2016. Her son was diagnosed at two years old with Kawasaki disease. 

She is a fan of the Vancouver Canucks.

===Activism===
Chalke&#x27;s aunt and grandmother both died from breast cancer that was undiagnosed while in its early stages. She has since encouraged breast cancer detection and prevention, and starred in the Lifetime movie &quot;Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy&quot;. She is an ambassador for the Audrey Hepburn Children&#x27;s Foundation. Chalke also made an appearance in a short video parodying a National Organization for Marriage&#x27;s advertisement opposing same-sex marriage, &quot;Gathering Storm&quot;. She was the 2009 ambassador for the Susan G. Komen Passionately Pink for the Cure program, for which she also designed a T-shirt.

<doc id="716158" wikidata="Q624380" url="?curid=716158" title="Descent (aeronautics)">
<text>In aeronautics, a descent is any time period during air travel where an aircraft decreases altitude, and is the opposite of an &quot;ascent&quot; or &quot;climb&quot;.

Descents are part of normal procedures, but also occur during emergencies, such as rapid or explosive decompression, forcing an emergency descent to below and preferably below , respectively the maximum temporary safe altitude for an unpressurized aircraft and the maximum safe altitude for extended duration.

An example of explosive decompression is Aloha Airlines Flight 243. Involuntary descent might occur from a decrease in power, decreased lift (wing icing), an increase in drag, or flying in an air mass moving downward, such as a terrain induced downdraft, near a thunderstorm, in a downburst, or microburst.

==Normal descents==
Intentional descents might be undertaken to land, avoid other air traffic or poor flight conditions (turbulence, icing conditions, or bad weather), clouds (particularly under visual flight rules), to see something lower, to enter warmer air (see adiabatic lapse rate), or to take advantage of wind direction of a different altitude, particularly with balloons.

Normal descents take place at a constant airspeed and constant angle of descent (3 degree final approach at most airports). The pilot controls the angle of descent by varying engine power and pitch angle (lowering the nose) to keep the airspeed constant. Unpowered descents (such as engine failure) are steeper than powered descents but flown in a similar way as a glider.

==Rapid descents==
Rapid descents relate to dramatic changes in cabin air pressure—even pressurized aircraft—and can result in discomfort in the middle ear. Relief is achieved by decreasing relative pressure by equalizing the middle ear with ambient pressure (&quot;popping ears&quot;) through swallowing, yawning, chewing, or the valsalva maneuver.

Helicopters which lose power do not simply fall out of the sky. In a maneuver called autorotation, the pilot configures the rotors to spin faster driven by the upward moving air, which limits the rate of descent. Very shortly before meeting the ground, the pilot changes the momentum stored in the rotor to increase lift to slow the rate of descent to a normal landing (but without extended hovering).

===Tactical descent===
A tactical descent is a maneuver typically used only by military aircraft. It consists of a steep angle dive to lose altitude rapidly, with the use of thrust reversers to prevent excessive speed.

===Dives===

A &quot;dive&quot; or &quot;nosedive&quot; is &quot;a steep descending flight path&quot;. While there is no specific definition for what degree of steepness transforms a downward trajectory into a dive, it is necessarily a rapid, nose-forward descent. Dives are used intentionally in aerobatic flying to build speed for the performance of stunts, and by dive bombers to approach a target quickly while minimizing exposure to enemy fire before the dive, and in order to increase accuracy of the bombing. A dive may also be used as an emergency maneuver, for example to extinguish an engine fire.

Pilots of the World War II dive bomber known as the Stuka particularly noted the effects of the dive. Beginning at a height of , the Stuka would roll 180°, automatically nosing into a dive. The aircraft would then dive at a 60-90° angle, holding a constant speed of , until it had gone some 90% of the way to the ground, releasing its bombs at a minimum height of . Once the pilot released the bomb and initiated an automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column, the aircraft automatically began a six &quot;g&quot; pullout. The tremendous g-forces to which pilots were subjected during this maneuver could lead to momentary blackouts, necessitating the inclusion of mechanisms to automate pullout from the dive while the pilot was unconscious.

<doc id="716161" wikidata="Q468884" url="?curid=716161" title="Ella Baker">
<text>Ella Josephine Baker (December 13, 1903 – December 13, 1986) was an African-American civil rights and human rights activist. She was a largely behind-the-scenes organizer whose career spanned more than five decades. In New York City and the South, she worked alongside some of the most noted civil rights leaders of the 20th century, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, and Martin Luther King Jr. She also mentored many emerging activists, such as Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, and Bob Moses, as leaders in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).

Baker criticized professionalized, charismatic leadership; she promoted grassroots organizing, radical democracy, and the ability of the oppressed to understand their worlds and advocate for themselves. She realized this vision most fully in the 1960s as the primary advisor and strategist of the SNCC. Biographer Barbara Ransby calls Baker &quot;one of the most important American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement&quot;. She is known for her critiques of both racism in American culture and sexism in the civil rights movement.

==Early life==
Ella Josephine Baker was born on December 13, 1903, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Georgiana (called Anna) and Blake Baker, and first raised there. She was the second of three surviving children, bracketed by her older brother Blake Curtis and younger sister Maggie. Her father worked on a steamship line that sailed out of Norfolk, and so was often away. Her mother took in boarders to earn extra money. In 1910, Norfolk had a race riot in which whites attacked black workers from the shipyard. Her mother decided to take the family back to North Carolina while their father continued to work for the steamship company. Ella was seven when they returned to her mother&#x27;s rural hometown near Littleton, North Carolina.

As a child, Baker grew up with little influence. Her grandfather Mitchell had died, and her father&#x27;s parents lived a day&#x27;s ride away. She often listened to her grandmother, Josephine Elizabeth &quot;Bet&quot; Ross, tell stories about slavery and leaving the South to escape its oppressive society. At an early age, Baker gained a sense of social injustice, as she listened to her grandmother&#x27;s horror stories of life as an enslaved person. Her grandmother was beaten and whipped for refusing to marry an enslaved man her owner chose, and told Ella other stories of life as an African-American woman during this period. Giving her granddaughter context to the African-American experience helped Baker understand the injustices black people still faced.

Ella attended Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and graduated with valedictorian honors. Decades later, she returned to Shaw to help found SNCC.

==Early activism==

=== First efforts (1930–1937) ===
Baker worked as editorial assistant at the &quot;Negro National News&quot;. In 1930, George Schuyler, a black journalist and anarchist (and later an arch-conservative), founded the Young Negroes Cooperative League (YNCL). It sought to develop black economic power through collective networks. They conducted &quot;conferences and trainings in the 1930s in their attempt to create a small, interlocking system of cooperative economic societies throughout the US&quot; for black economic development. Having befriended Schuyler, Baker joined his group in 1931 and soon became its national director.

Baker also worked for the Worker&#x27;s Education Project of the Works Progress Administration, established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Baker taught courses in consumer education, labor history, and African history. She immersed herself in the cultural and political milieu of Harlem in the 1930s, protesting Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia and supporting the campaign to free the Scottsboro defendants in Alabama. She also founded the Negro History Club at the Harlem Library and regularly attended lectures and meetings at the YWCA.

During this time, Baker lived with and married her college sweetheart, T. J. (Bob) Roberts. They divorced in 1958. Baker rarely discussed her private life or marital status. According to fellow activist Bernice Johnson Reagon, many women in the Civil Rights Movement followed Baker&#x27;s example, adopting a practice of dissemblance about their private lives that allowed them to be accepted as individuals in the movement.

Baker befriended John Henrik Clarke, a future scholar and activist; Pauli Murray, a future writer and civil rights lawyer; and others who became lifelong friends. The Harlem Renaissance influenced her thoughts and teachings. She advocated widespread, local action as a means of social change. Her emphasis on a grassroots approach to the struggle for equal rights influenced the growth and success of the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century.

===NAACP (1938–1953)===
In 1938 Baker began her long association with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), then based in New York City. In December 1940 she started work there as a secretary. She traveled widely for the organization, especially in the South, recruiting members, raising money, and organizing local chapters. She was named director of branches in 1943, and became the NAACP&#x27;s highest-ranking woman. An outspoken woman, Baker believed in egalitarian ideals. She pushed the NAACP to decentralize its leadership structure and to aid its membership in more activist campaigns at the local level.

Baker believed that the strength of an organization grew from the bottom up, not the top down. She believed that the branches&#x27; work was the NAACP&#x27;s lifeblood. Baker despised elitism and placed her confidence in many. She believed that the bedrock of any social change organization is not its leaders&#x27; eloquence or credentials, but the commitment and hard work of the rank and file membership and their willingness and ability to engage in discussion, debate, and decision-making. She especially stressed the importance of young people and women in the organization.

While traveling throughout the South on the NAACP&#x27;s behalf, Baker met hundreds of black people, establishing lasting relationships with them. She slept in their homes, ate at their tables, spoke in their churches, and earned their trust. She wrote thank-you notes and expressed her gratitude to the people she met. This personalized approach was one important aspect of Baker&#x27;s effectiveness in recruiting more NAACP members. She formed a network of people in the South who would be important in the continued fight for civil rights. Whereas some northern organizers tended to talk down to rural southerners, Baker&#x27;s ability to treat everyone with respect helped her in recruiting. Baker fought to make the NAACP more democratic. She tried to find a balance between voicing her concerns and maintaining a unified front.

Between 1944 and 1946, Baker directed leadership conferences in several major cities, such as Chicago and Atlanta. She got top officials to deliver lectures, offer welcoming remarks, and conduct workshops.

In 1946, Baker took in her niece Jackie, whose mother was unable to care for her. Due to her new responsibilities, Baker left her full-time position with the NAACP and began to serve as a volunteer. She soon joined the NAACP&#x27;s New York branch to work on local school desegregation and police brutality issues. She became its president in 1952. In this role, she supervised the field secretaries and coordinated the national office&#x27;s work with local groups. Baker&#x27;s top priority was to lessen the organization&#x27;s bureaucracy and give women more power in the organization; this included reducing Walter Francis White&#x27;s dominating role as executive secretary.

Baker believed the program should be primarily channeled not through White and the national office, but through the people in the field. She lobbied to reduce the rigid hierarchy, place more power in the hands of capable local leaders, and give local branches greater responsibility and autonomy. In 1953 she resigned from the presidency to run for the New York City Council on the Liberal Party ticket, but was unsuccessful.

==Civil rights movement==
===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957–1960)===
In January 1957, Baker went to Atlanta to attend a conference aimed at developing a new regional organization to build on the success of the Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama. After a second conference in February, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was formed. This was planned as a loosely structured coalition of church-based leaders who were engaged in civil rights struggles across the South. The group wanted to emphasize the use of nonviolent actions to bring about social progress and racial justice for southern blacks. They intended to rely on the existing black churches, at the heart of their communities, as a base of its support. Its strength would be built on the political activities of local church affiliates. The SCLC leaders envisioned themselves as the political arm of the black church.

The SCLC first appeared publicly as an organization at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. Baker was one of three major organizers of this large-scale event. She demonstrated her ability to straddle organizational lines, ignoring and minimizing rivalries and battles. The conference&#x27;s first project was the 1958 Crusade for Citizenship, a voter registration campaign to increase the number of registered African-American voters for the 1958 and 1960 elections. Baker was hired as Associate Director, the first staff person for the SCLC. Reverend John Tilley became the first Executive Director. Baker worked closely with southern civil rights activists in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and gained respect for her organizing abilities. She helped initiate voter registration campaigns and identify other local grievances. Their strategy included education, sermons in churches, and efforts to establish grassroots centers to stress the importance of the vote. They also planned to rely on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to protect local voters. While the project did not achieve its immediate goals, it laid the groundwork for strengthening local activist centers to build a mass movement for the vote across the South. After John Tilley resigned as director of the SCLC, Baker lived and worked in Atlanta for two and a half years as interim executive director until Reverend Wyatt Tee Walker started in the role in April 1960.

Baker&#x27;s job with the SCLC was more frustrating than fruitful. She was unsettled politically, physically, and emotionally. She had no solid allies in the office. Historian Thomas F. Jackson notes that Baker criticized the organization for &quot;programmatic sluggishness and King&#x27;s distance from the people. King was a better orator than democratic crusader[, she] concluded.&quot;

===Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (1960–1966)===
That same year, 1960, on the heels of regional desegregation sit-ins led by black college students, Baker persuaded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to invite southern university students to the Southwide Youth Leadership Conference at Shaw University on Easter weekend. This was a gathering of sit-in leaders to meet, assess their struggles, and explore the possibilities for future actions. At this meeting, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced &quot;snick&quot;) was formed.

Baker saw the potential for a special type of leadership by the young sit-in leaders, who were not yet prominent in the movement. She believed they could revitalize the Black Freedom Movement and take it in a new direction. Baker wanted to bring the sit-in participants together in a way that would sustain the momentum of their actions, teach them the skills necessary, provide the resources that were needed, and also help them to coalesce into a more militant and democratic force. To this end she worked to keep the students independent of the older, church-based leadership. In her address at Shaw, she warned the activists to be wary of &quot;leader-centered orientation&quot;. Julian Bond later described the speech as &quot;an eye opener&quot; and probably the best of the conference. &quot;She didn&#x27;t say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t let Martin Luther King tell you what to do,&#x27;&quot; Bond remembers, &quot;but you got the real feeling that that&#x27;s what she meant.&quot;

SNCC became the most active organization in the deeply oppressed Mississippi Delta. It was more open to women than the other prominent Civil Rights organizations, including the SCLC, where Baker witnessed extensive misogynistic teachings and the suppression of women activists. But widespread sexism and appeals to male supremacy pervaded its membership. After the conference at Shaw, Baker resigned from the SCLC and began a long and close relationship with SNCC. Along with Howard Zinn, she was one of SNCC&#x27;s highly revered adult advisors, known as the &quot;Godmother of SNCC&quot;.

In 1961 Baker persuaded the SNCC to form two wings: one wing for direct action and the second wing for voter registration. With Baker&#x27;s help SNCC, along with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), coordinated the region-wide Freedom Rides of 1961. They also expanded their grassroots movement among black sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and others throughout the South. Ella Baker insisted that &quot;strong people don&#x27;t need strong leaders&quot;, and criticized the notion of a single charismatic leader of movements for social change. In keeping the idea of &quot;participatory democracy&quot;, Baker wanted each person to get involved. She also argued that &quot;people under the heel&quot;, the most oppressed members of any community, &quot;had to be the ones to decide what action they were going to take to get (out) from under their oppression&quot;.

She was a teacher and mentor to the young people of SNCC, influencing such important future leaders as Julian Bond, Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, Curtis Muhammad, Bob Moses, and Bernice Johnson Reagon. Through SNCC, Baker&#x27;s ideas of group-centered leadership and the need for radical democratic social change spread throughout the student movements of the 1960s. For instance, the Students for a Democratic Society, the major antiwar group of the day, promoted participatory democracy. These ideas also influenced a wide range of radical and progressive groups that would form in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1964 Baker helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) as an alternative to the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party. She worked as the coordinator of the Washington office of the MFDP and accompanied a delegation of the MFDP to the 1964 National Democratic Party convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The group wanted to challenge the national party to affirm the rights of African Americans to participate in party elections in the South, where they were still largely disenfranchised. When MFDP delegates challenged the pro-segregationist, all-white official delegation, a major conflict ensued. The MFDP delegation was not seated, but their influence on the Democratic Party later helped to elect many black leaders in Mississippi. They forced a rule change to allow women and minorities to sit as delegates at the Democratic National Convention.

The 1964 schism with the national Democratic Party led SNCC toward the &quot;black power&quot; position. Baker was less involved with SNCC during this period, but her withdrawal was due more to her declining health than to ideological differences. According to her biographer Barbara Ransby, Baker believed that black power was a relief from the &quot;stale and unmoving demands and language of the more mainstream civil rights groups at the time.&quot; She also accepted the turn towards armed self-defense that SNCC made in the course of its development. Her friend and biographer Joanne Grant wrote that &quot;Baker, who always said that she would never be able to turn the other cheek, turned a blind eye to the prevalence of weapons. While she herself would rely on her fists ... she had no qualms about target practice.&quot;

==Later years==
===Southern Conference Education Fund (1962–1967)===
From 1962 to 1967, Baker worked as the staff of the Southern Conference Education Fund (SCEF). Its goal was to help black and white people work together for social justice; the interracial desegregation and human rights group was based in the South. SCEF raised funds for black activists, lobbied for implementation of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s civil rights proposals, and tried to educate southern whites about the evils of racism. Federal civil rights legislation was passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and 1965, but implementation took years.

In SCEF, Baker worked closely with her friend Anne Braden, a white longtime anti-racist activist. Braden had been accused in the 1950s of being a communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Baker believed that socialism, the transitory phase toward communism, was a humane alternative to capitalism. She became a staunch defender of Braden and her husband Carl; she encouraged SNCC to reject red-baiting as divisive and unfair. During the 1960s, Baker participated in a speaking tour and co-hosted several meetings on the importance of linking civil rights and civil liberties.

=== Final efforts (1968–1986) ===
In 1967 Baker returned to New York City, where she continued her activism. She later collaborated with Arthur Kinoy and others to form the Mass Party Organizing Committee, a socialist organization. In 1972 she traveled the country in support of the &quot;Free Angela&quot; campaign, demanding the release of activist and writer Angela Davis, who had been imprisoned on charges of kidnapping and murder in the Marin County Civic Center attacks. Davis was eventually acquitted.

Baker also supported the Puerto Rican independence movement and spoke out against apartheid in South Africa. She allied with a number of women&#x27;s groups, including the Third World Women&#x27;s Alliance and the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. She remained an activist until her death on December 13, 1986, her 83rd birthday.

==Thought==
In the 1960s, the idea of &quot;participatory democracy&quot; became popular among political activists, including those in the Civil Rights Movement. It took the traditional appeal of democracy and added direct citizen participation.

The new movement had three primary emphases:
* An appeal for grassroots involvement of people throughout society, while making their own decisions
* The minimization of (bureaucratic) hierarchy and the associated emphasis on expertise and professionalism as a basis for leadership
* A call for direct action as an answer to fear, isolation, and intellectual detachment

Baker said:

You didn&#x27;t see me on television, you didn&#x27;t see news stories about me. The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong people don&#x27;t need strong leaders.

According to Mumia Abu-Jamal, Baker advocated a more collectivist model of leadership over the &quot;prevailing messianic style of the period&quot;. She was largely arguing against the structuring of the civil rights movement by the organization model of the black church. The black church then had largely female membership and male leadership. Baker questioned not only the gendered hierarchy of the civil rights movement but also that of the Black church.

Baker, King, and other SCLC members were reported to have differences in opinion and philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s. She was older than many of the young ministers she worked with, which added to their tensions. She once said the &quot;movement made Martin, and not Martin the movement&quot;. When she gave a speech urging activists to take control of the movement themselves, rather than rely on a leader with &quot;heavy feet of clay&quot;, it was widely interpreted as a denunciation of King.

Baker&#x27;s philosophy was &quot;power to the people&quot;. If members worked together, she believed that a group&#x27;s force could make significant changes.

<text>The brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), also known by its Australian native name tuan, the common wambenger, the black-tailed mousesack or the black-tailed phascogale, is a rat-sized arboreal carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae, characterized by a tuft of black silky hairs on the terminal portion of its tail. Males of this species do not live past the age of one, as they die after reproducing.

==Taxonomy==

The brush-tailed phascogale was first described by Friedrich Meyer in 1793; George Shaw published a revised description in 1800. For some time it was considered a member of the opossum genus &quot;Didelphis&quot;, but this ended in 1844 when Coenraad Jacob Temminck erected the genus &quot;Phascogale&quot;. The species is closely related to the red-tailed phascogale (&quot;P. calura&quot;). Its scientific name, &quot;tapoatafa&quot;, is a reference to an indigenous Australian
name for the species. It has sometimes been known as &quot;Phascogale penicillata&quot;, referring to its brushed tail. 
In 2015 three subspecies were identified, and the previous subspecies &quot;P. t. pirata&quot; was confirmed as a separate species &quot;P. pirata&quot;:
*&quot;P. t. tapoatafa&quot;, found in southeast Australia from South Australia to mid-coastal Queensland;
*&quot;P. t. wambenger&quot;, found in southwest Western Australia;
*&quot;P. t. kimberleyensis&quot;, found in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
The subspecies that the population in Cape York Peninsula represents has yet to be identified.

==Description==
This phascogale is grey. Its tail is covered with long black hairs on the lower half that can erect, causing it to appear similar to a bottle brush. Body length is between with a 16 to 24 cm tail. Males, which can reach up to , are larger than females, normally weighing less than 210 g.

==Distribution and habitat==

The brush-tailed phascogale has a widespread but fragmented distribution throughout all states of Australia, excluding Tasmania. As a result of habitat destruction and predation by the red fox and feral cat, they are believed to have disappeared from roughly half of their former range. The species is considered very vulnerable to localised extinction.

It is listed as a vulnerable species on Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (TSC Act, NSW). However the IUCN Red List lists it only as near threatened, and it does not have an EPBC Act status.

==Diet==
This species is a nocturnal and arboreal hunter. It is an opportunistic generalist that predominantly eats invertebrates, though it also eats smaller mammals, birds, and lizards. It also drinks nectar from flowering trees. Consumption of bird eggs has also been recorded. The species has been reported to attack domestic poultry.

The Brush-tailed phascogale is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Australiformis semoni&quot;.

==Reproduction==

Breeding occurs between June and August when the females come into estrus. All male brush-tailed phascogales die before reaching one year of age, generally from stress-related diseases brought about by the energy expended in a bout of frenzied mating. However, some captive males have lived to the age of three, though they were reproductively unviable after the first year. Females nest in hollow trees, bearing litters of 7 to 8 young which stay in the nest to the age of 5 months.

<text>Frolic Froth is a psychedelic band formed in Mexico City by members Victor Basurto (bass) and Arturo López (drums) of Loch Ness, and Jorge Beltrán (guitar) from Humus. These three musicians had previously played together in diverse bands along with other musicians during the 1980s and good part of the 1990s, until they finally decided to break away from the sound of previous bands and start Frolic Froth.

Their sound is a heavy in the old psychedelic sense, basically being a tribute to Germany&#x27;s Guru Guru, Jimi Hendrix and the avant-garde groups known as &#x27;Rock in Opposition&#x27;: Henry Cow (England), Etron Fou Lelublan (France), Faust (Germany), and others. Some international polls have voted them (in particular the album &quot;Ouroboros&quot;) as one of the most influential psychedelic albums from Mexico.

They have recorded four albums, but only released two:
*&quot;Eponymous&quot;, 1996, CD.
*&quot;Ouroboros&quot;, 1996, CD, LP (manufactured in Italy)
Victor Basurto and Jorge Beltrán continue to collaborate in other bands like Humus, Smoking The Century Away and Ascetic Chuckwalla.

<text>Anthony Geary (born May 29, 1947) is a retired American actor. Geary is best known for playing the role of Luke Spencer on the ABC daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He originated the role of Luke in 1978, and went on to earn a record eight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series prior to his retirement. 

In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had a prominent supporting role in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic comedy &quot;UHF&quot; (1989); other notable films include &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; (1971), &quot;Disorderlies&quot; (1987), &quot;Scorchers&quot; (1991), &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (2004) and &quot;Fish Tank&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Anthony Geary was born May 29, 1947, in Coalville, Utah, a son of a contractor father and homemaker mother. He was raised a Mormon.

==Personal life==
Geary married his longtime partner Claudio Gama in 2020. They have resided happily in Amsterdam, Netherlands since 2017. Geary does not have any children. In a comment about the Hollywood divorce rate, Geary once said that he is able to focus on himself because he doesn&#x27;t have children.

==Career==
Geary made his first appearance on television in an episode of &quot;Room 222&quot; and later appeared in &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, and &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;. 

Geary&#x27;s first daytime role was in NBC soap opera &quot;Bright Promise&quot; from 1971 to 1972. He also played George Curtis, who was a rapist, in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from August to November 1973. 

In 1978, Geary was hired for a 13-week story arc to play Luke Spencer in ABC soap &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Luke Spencer began as a hit man and later became a rapist who fell in love with and subsequently married his victim, Laura Webber (played by Genie Francis). His portrayal of Luke Spencer on &quot;General Hospital&quot; was well received and grew into a full contract role. The 1981 on-screen wedding of his character and Laura Webber holds the record as the highest-rated soap opera episode of all time.

He holds the distinction of winning a record eight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He was first nominated in 1980 and had his first win in 1982. Geary was nominated again in 1983, before leaving the show in 1984. Over the next several years, he took roles in various theater and television productions, as well as in several films, but not at the level of success he had hoped for. Despite the popularity of his work as Luke Spencer, filmmakers such as Oliver Stone pigeonholed Geary based solely on the fact that he was a &quot;soap actor&quot;. In a conscious effort to distance himself from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, he actively sought a role in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s film debut &quot;UHF&quot; (1989), that of the quietly eccentric scientist Philo (named for television pioneer Philo Farnsworth). Geary, a fan of Yankovic, went so far as to grow his hair out like Albert Einstein&#x27;s and stay in character as Philo when meeting the film&#x27;s casting team; he immediately landed the role.
In 1991, Geary returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Luke&#x27;s cousin and look-alike Bill Eckert, due to the actor&#x27;s desire to play someone other than Luke. However, due to poor feedback from the viewing public, the character was killed off and Geary resumed the role of Luke in 1993. Tony appeared in more than 50 stage plays, including an award-winning one-man show titled Human Scratchings in 1996. He was nominated in 1997 and 1998 for Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor, and had his second win in 1999, and his third in 2000. He received another nomination in 2003, and had his fourth win in 2004. When Geary won for the fifth time in 2006, he set the record for the most lead actor wins. Geary received another Emmy nomination in 2007, and in 2008, he again set a record for most lead actor wins with his sixth Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor.

Geary set a record in 2012 with his seventh Daytime Emmy win and again in 2015 for his eighth win for Outstanding Leading Actor in a Drama Series after 16 nominations for the same role of &quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s Luke Spencer. Geary publicly announced on Friday, May 8, 2015, that he would be leaving his role on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Geary finished taping his last scenes on the &quot;General Hospital&quot; set on June 23, 2015. His last air date was July 27, 2015. He later made a cameo appearance on a May 2017 episode to facilitate the retirement of co-star Jane Elliot, who played Luke&#x27;s former on-screen wife Tracy Quartermaine.

An exception to his series of dramatic roles is the part of a scientist/studio engineer in the comedy movie &quot;UHF&quot;. He also appeared in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Disorderlies&quot;, with rappers the Fat Boys.

<text>Genie Francis (born May 26, 1962) is an American actress. She is best known for playing the role of Laura Spencer on the television soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1977 to present, for which she won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2007.

Francis also appeared in the soap operas &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1987 to 1989, &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1990 to 1992 and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 2011 to 2012.

==Early life==
Francis was born in Englewood, New Jersey. Her father was Canadian actor Ivor Francis. Her mother, Rosemary Daley, was a former actress/model. Genie has an older brother, Ivor Jr.; a younger brother, Kenneth; and an older half-sister, Shelley, from her father&#x27;s first marriage.

==Career==
Francis began acting in the two part episode titled &quot;Jury Duty&quot; on the television series &quot;Family&quot;. Her biggest role came in 1977 with Laura Spencer on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as she was a recast. It would bring her instant stardom in the late 1970s. The television couple of Luke and Laura wed on November 17, 1981, with 30 million viewers tuning in to make the episode the highest-rated hour in soap opera history. At the peak of her success, Francis left the series in 1982 to try her hand at prime-time television. Soon afterward, she landed a starring role in her own series, &quot;Bare Essence&quot;, which was unsuccessful. She returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1983 for a limited run, to coincide with the departure of Luke when Anthony Geary decided to leave the series. 

In 1984, 1986 and 1990, Francis guest starred on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; as Jessica Fletcher&#x27;s niece Victoria. In 1985, she starred in the miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; as Brett Main Hazard. Francis would reprise her role of Brett Main Hazard in 1986 and 1994 in the miniseries &quot;North and South: Book II&quot; and &quot;Heaven and Hell: North and South Book III&quot; respectively. In 1993, she starred in the television film &quot;Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss&quot; as Kris Buckner which was based on the CBS television series of the same name. In 1996, Francis provided the voice of Betty Ross on the &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; animated series that ran on UPN.

Through the years, Francis has appeared on numerous other daytime soaps. She starred on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Diana Colville (a reporter who became involved with John Black, at the time believing himself to be Roman Brady) from 1987 to 1989 and on &quot;All My Children&quot; as con artist and incest victim Ceara Connor Hunter from 1990 to 1992. She reprised her role as Ceara on &quot;Loving&quot; in a crossover storyline in November 1991. Ceara was &quot;killed off&quot; when her character prepared to move to that soap&#x27;s town of Corinth (although it was an unseen extra stepping off the bus into the line of fire), and years later, Laura also appeared in Corinth on &quot;General Hospital&quot; when ex-husband Luke found her tied up in the Alden family basement. She then returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1993. In 1994, when Francis became pregnant with her first child, the pregnancy was written into the show and she took six weeks off for maternity leave. However, in early 1997, when she was pregnant again, she took a much longer absence from the show, staying away for nearly a year and a half. 

In 2004, Francis appeared in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. In June 2006, she began negotiating with the casting directors on the show to return to the role of Laura Spencer for a limited run through November. Francis returned with spectacular fanfare to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Luke and Laura&#x27;s wedding. Though she reprised the role for only one month, Francis&#x27; stint garnered her a Daytime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, which she won in June 2007. Francis returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in August 2008 to reprise her role, appearing until November 12. In December 2008, she had a starring role in the Hallmark Channel movie, &quot;The Note&quot;, which earned her critical acclaim. On January 31, 2009, Francis reprised her role of Peyton MacGruder in the Hallmark Channel movie, &quot;Taking a Chance on Love&quot;. In 2012, she again reprised her role as Peyton MacGruder in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;Notes from the Heart Healer&quot;.

In March 2011, it was announced that Francis would join &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Genevieve Atkinson, the long-absent birth mother of Cane Ashby. With her appearance, she was reunited with former &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Tristan Rogers, who portrayed Colin Atkinson, Cane&#x27;s estranged biological father. She received her second Daytime Emmy nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Genevieve in May 2012.

On September 13, 2012, it was announced that Francis had been let go from her role on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; due to budget cuts. On January 8, 2013, executive producer Frank Valentini and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; confirmed that Francis would return to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, first airing on February 11. However, she remained with the series for only five months, as Laura departed for medical treatment in France, returning on June 5, 2015, as part of a storyline to help facilitate Anthony Geary&#x27;s departure from the show and would later sign a contract to remain with the show. In January 2018, Francis was dropped to recurring status and in late July 2018 signed a contract to return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; full-time.

===Other projects===
Francis owned a store called The Cherished Home. It was located at 31 Searsport Avenue, Belfast, Maine 04915, and they also sold items online. The store sold cottage furnishings and home accessories. Francis sold the store in August 2012, due to her workload on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. The store closed in the fall of 2012. 

In May 2007, Francis began appearing in magazine advertisements as a spokesperson for the Medifast Diet, claiming she lost 30 pounds as of December 2007, using the diet.

In November 2009, Francis along with her brothers, Ivor Jr. and Kenneth released &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas Time Again&quot;. They decided to donate a part of all record sales to the Sisters of Saint Francis Children&#x27;s Mission in Cuernavaca, a mission founded by her cousin Sister Margaret. Francis decided to donate all of her proceeds/sales to this mission. This endeavor was a project involving various members of her family.

==Personal life==
Francis first met actor/director Jonathan Frakes in 1982 while filming the television miniseries &quot;Bare Essence&quot;. After meeting again in 1984 during the filming of the miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;, Francis and Frakes began dating in 1985. They became engaged the following year, and were married on May 28, 1988. The couple have two children, Jameson Ivor Frakes and Elizabeth Frances Frakes. After residing in Belfast, Maine, they moved to Beverly Hills, California, in 2008 and later relocated to Calabasas, California.

<text>Victoria Helen McCrae Duncan (née MacFarlane, 25 November 1897 – 6 December 1956) was a Scottish medium best known as the last person to be imprisoned under the Witchcraft Act 1735 (9 Geo. 2. c. 5) for fraudulent claims. She was famous for producing ectoplasm which was proved to be made from cheesecloth.

==Early life==
Victoria Helen MacFarlane was born in Callander, Perthshire on 25 November 1897, the daughter of Archibald McFarlane, a slater, and Isabella Rattray. At school, she alarmed her fellow pupils with her dire prophecies and hysterical behaviour, to the distress of her mother (a member of the Presbyterian church). After leaving school, she worked at Dundee Royal Infirmary, and in 1916, she married Henry Duncan, a cabinet maker and wounded war veteran, who was supportive of her supposed paranormal talents. A mother of six, she also worked part-time in a bleach factory.

==Practising medium==
In 1926, she developed from clairvoyant to physical medium by offering séances in which she claimed to be able to permit the spirits of recently deceased persons to materialise, by emitting ectoplasm from her mouth.

In 1928, photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of séances at Duncan&#x27;s home. During a séance he took various flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged &quot;materialization&quot; of spirits, including her spirit guide &quot;Peggy&quot;. His photographs reveal that the spirits were fraudulently produced: Duncan&#x27;s equipment included a doll made from a painted papier-mâché mask draped in an old sheet.

In 1931, the London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA) examined Duncan&#x27;s methods. An early examination of pieces of Duncan&#x27;s ectoplasm revealed that it was made of cheesecloth, paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan&#x27;s tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm, and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of her séances by the LSA committee to rule out any chance of this trick being performed, and because of this, no ectoplasm appeared. The committee concluded in a report that the &quot;material was swallowed by Mrs Duncan at some time previous to the sitting and subsequently regurgitated by her for the purpose of exhibition.&quot;

===Harry Price&#x27;s investigation===

A piece of ectoplasm from one of Duncan&#x27;s early séances was obtained and secured in a bottle of distilled water. It was given to the psychical researcher Harry Price, who was originally enthusiastic about the sample. However, when he gave the sample to a chemist for an analysis it was discovered that it had been made from egg white mixed with chemicals. Price later duplicated Duncan&#x27;s ectoplasm with similar substances.

In 1931, Price paid Duncan £50 (almost £4,300 in 2024) to conduct a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth, which was then regurgitated as &quot;ectoplasm&quot;. Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan that it was made of cheesecloth. She reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the test&#x27;s controlled nature. According to Price, in a report of the mediumship of Duncan:

In his report, Price published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audiences were spirits. Psychologist William McDougall, who attended two of the séances, pronounced her &quot;whole performance fraudulent&quot; in an appendix to the report.

Following Price&#x27;s report, Duncan&#x27;s former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan&#x27;s husband admitted that the ectoplasm materializations were the result of regurgitation.

Duncan frequently had nosebleeds during séances; William Brown suggested that this was another of Duncan&#x27;s hiding places for her fake ectoplasm. In 1936, psychical researcher Nandor Fodor offered money to Duncan if she would be filmed with an infrared camera during a séance; she refused.

===1933 conviction ===

In a séance on 6 January 1933 in Edinburgh, the spirit of a little girl called Peggy supposedly emerged in the séance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was revealed to be made from a stockinette undervest. The police were called, and Duncan was prosecuted and fined ten pounds. The undervest was used as evidence which led to Duncan&#x27;s conviction of fraudulent mediumship at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court trial on 11 May 1933.

The spiritualist journal &quot;Light&quot; endorsed the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported Price&#x27;s investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was cheesecloth. Duncan&#x27;s husband was also suspected of acting as her accomplice by hiding her fake ectoplasm.

===Ectoplasm sample===

Malcolm Gaskill, who examined holdings from the Society for Psychical Research at the Cambridge University Library, found a sample of Duncan&#x27;s ectoplasm. The ectoplasm proved to be made from a length of artificial silk. In 2018, the sample was displayed at the Spellbound exhibition on the history of magic at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The sample is now held at Cambridge University Library and a photograph can be seen on the library website.

==HMS &quot;Barham&quot; sinking==
During World War II, in November 1941, Duncan held a séance in Portsmouth at which she claimed the spirit materialization of a sailor told her HMS &quot;Barham&quot; had been sunk. Because the sinking of HMS &quot;Barham&quot; was revealed, in strict confidence, only to the relatives of casualties, and not announced to the public until late January 1942, the Navy started to take an interest in her activities. Two lieutenants were among her audience at a séance on 14 January 1944. One of these was a Lieutenant Worth, who was not impressed as a white cloth figure had appeared behind the curtains claiming to be his aunt, but he had no deceased aunt. In the same sitting, another figure appeared claiming to be his sister, but Worth replied his sister was alive and well. Worth was disgusted by the séance and reported it to the police. This was followed up on 19 January, when undercover policemen arrested her at another séance as a white-shrouded manifestation appeared. This proved to be Duncan herself, in a white cloth which she attempted to conceal when discovered, and she was arrested.

Researcher Graeme Donald wrote that Duncan could have easily found out about HMS &quot;Barham&quot; and she had no genuine psychic powers. According to Donald:

A leak concerning HMS &quot;Barham&quot; was later discovered. A secretary of the First Sea Lord had been indiscreet to Professor Michael Postan of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Postan said that he believed he had been told officially, and was not arrested.

Duncan was found to be in possession of a mocked-up HMS &quot;Barham&quot; hat-band. This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS &quot;Barham&quot;, although Duncan apparently did not know that after 1939 sailors&#x27; hat bands carried only &#x27;H.M.S.&#x27; and did not identify their ship. She was initially arrested under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, a minor offence tried by magistrates. The authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent &quot;spiritual&quot; activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan&#x27;s agent and went with her to set up séances. There were seven counts, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of the common law offence of public mischief. The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were afraid that she could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was. There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the Recorder noted when passing sentence.

Duncan&#x27;s trial for fraudulent witchcraft was a minor cause célèbre in wartime London. Alfred Dodd, a historian and senior Freemason, testified he was convinced she was authentic. The trial was complicated by the fact that a police raid on the séance in Portsmouth, leading to the arrest of Helen Duncan, yielded no physical evidence of the fraudulent use of cheesecloth, and was therefore based entirely on witness testimony, the majority of which denied any wrongdoing. Duncan was barred by the judge from demonstrating her alleged powers as part of her defence against being fraudulent. The jury brought in a guilty verdict on count one, and the judge then discharged them from giving verdicts on the other counts, as he held that they were alternative offences for which Duncan might have been convicted had the jury acquitted her on the first count. Duncan was imprisoned for nine months, Brown for four months, and the Homers were bound over. After the verdict, Winston Churchill wrote a memo to Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, complaining about the misuse of court resources on the &quot;obsolete tomfoolery&quot; of the charge.

==Repeal of the Witchcraft Act==
In 1944, Duncan was one of the last people convicted under the Witchcraft Act 1735 (9 Geo. 2 c. 5), which made falsely claiming to procure spirits a crime. She was sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment. When convicted, she cried out &quot;I have done nothing; is there a God?&quot;.

On her release in 1945, Duncan promised to stop conducting séances, but she was arrested during another one in 1956. She died at her home in Edinburgh a short time later. Duncan&#x27;s trial almost certainly contributed to the repeal of the Witchcraft Act 1735, which was contained in the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 (14 &amp; 15 Geo. 6. c. 33) promoted by Walter Monslow, Labour Member of Parliament for Barrow-in-Furness. The campaign to repeal the Act had largely been led by Thomas Brooks, another Labour MP, who was a spiritualist. Duncan&#x27;s original conviction still stood, and it was the subject of a sustained campaign to have it overturned.

==Death==
Duncan died at her home in Edinburgh, on 6 December 1956, a short time after another seance. It is believed by spiritualists that she died as a result of the sudden impact of ectoplasm snapping back into her body when the police that raided her séance turned on the light. Contrary to what these spiritualists have written, it is unlikely that there was anything unusual about Duncan&#x27;s death, nor was it caused by the police disturbing her &quot;trance.&quot; Duncan&#x27;s medical records indicated that she had a long history of poor health, and as early as 1944 was described as an obese woman who could move only slowly as she suffered from heart trouble.

==Legacy==
After her death, Duncan was widely cited as an example of a fraudulent medium. However, some spiritualists continued to defend her. According to Jenny Hazelgrove,

Psychical researcher Simeon Edmunds also noted that spiritualists had a history of ignoring the evidence of fraud in the Duncan case. He criticized the spiritualist press such as &quot;Psychic News&quot; for biased reporting and distorting facts. Science writer Mary Roach, in her book &quot;&quot; (2007), favorably mentioned Price&#x27;s methods in debunking Duncan as a fraudulent medium.

In 2009, a heavy metal band, Seventh Son, recorded and released a song, &quot;The Last Witch in England&quot;, depicting Duncan&#x27;s life and her claims about the sinking of HMS &quot;Barham&quot;.

The naval investigation and subsequent trial were dramatised in a radio play, &quot;The Last Witch Trial,&quot; by Melissa Murray, starring Joanna Monro as Duncan and Indira Varma as the undercover investigator. It was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 4 June 2010.

Descendants and supporters of Duncan have campaigned on several occasions to have her posthumously pardoned. Petitions for a posthumous pardon were rejected by the Scottish Parliament in 2001, 2008 and 2012. Duncan&#x27;s supporters maintain a website and online petition where they continue to campaign for her pardon.

<text>The is the Japanese national air and space agency. Through the merger of three previously independent organizations, JAXA was formed on 1 October 2003. JAXA is responsible for research, technology development and launch of satellites into orbit, and is involved in many more advanced missions such as asteroid exploration and possible human exploration of the Moon. Its motto is &quot;One JAXA&quot; and its corporate slogan is &quot;Explore to Realize&quot; (formerly &quot;Reaching for the skies, exploring space&quot;).

== History ==


On 1 October 2003, three organizations were merged to form the new JAXA: Japan&#x27;s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL), and National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). JAXA was formed as an Independent Administrative Institution administered by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC).

Before the merger, ISAS was responsible for space and planetary research, while NAL was focused on aviation research. ISAS had been most successful in its space program in the field of X-ray astronomy during the 1980s and 1990s. Another successful area for Japan has been Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with the HALCA mission. Additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the magnetosphere, among other areas.

NASDA, which was founded on 1 October 1969, had developed rockets, satellites, and also built the Japanese Experiment Module. The old NASDA headquarters were located at the current site of the Tanegashima Space Center, on Tanegashima Island, 115 kilometers south of Kyūshū. NASDA was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology. However, since the satellite market of Japan is completely open, the first time a Japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005. Another prime focus of the NASDA body is Earth climate observation. NASDA also trained the Japanese astronauts who flew with the US Space Shuttles.

The Basic Space Law was passed in 2008, and the jurisdictional authority of JAXA moved from MEXT to the Strategic Headquarters for Space Development (SHSD) in the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. In 2016, the National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) was set up by the Cabinet.

JAXA was awarded the Space Foundation&#x27;s John L. &quot;Jack&quot; Swigert Jr., Award for Space Exploration in 2008.

Planning interplanetary research missions can take many years. Due to the lag time between these interplanetary events and mission planning time, opportunities to gain new knowledge about the cosmos might be lost. To prevent this, JAXA began commencing smaller and faster missions from 2010 onward.

In 2012, new legislation extended JAXA&#x27;s remit from peaceful purposes only to include some military space development, such as missile early warning systems. Political control of JAXA passed from MEXT to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cabinet Office through a new Space Strategy Office.

== Rockets ==

JAXA uses the H-IIA (H &quot;two&quot; A) rocket from the former NASDA body as a medium-lift launch vehicle. JAXA has also developed a new medium-lift vehicle H3. For smaller launch needs, JAXA uses the Epsilon rocket. For experiments in the upper atmosphere JAXA uses the SS-520, S-520, and S-310 sounding rockets.

Historical, nowadays retired, JAXA orbital rockets are as follows: Mu rocket family (M-V) and H-IIB.

=== Launch development ===
Japan launched its first satellite, Ohsumi, in 1970, using ISAS&#x27; L-4S rocket. Prior to the merger, ISAS used small Mu rocket family of solid-fueled launch vehicles, while NASDA developed larger liquid-fueled launchers. In the beginning, NASDA used licensed American models.

The first model of liquid-fueled launch vehicle developed domestically in Japan was the H-II, introduced in 1994. NASDA developed the H-II with two goals in mind: to be able to launch satellites using only its own technology, such as the ISAS, and to dramatically improve its launch capability over previous licensed models. To achieve these two goals, a staged combustion cycle was adopted for the first stage engine, the LE-7. The combination of the liquid hydrogen two-stage combustion cycle first stage engine and solid rocket boosters was carried over to its successor, the H-IIA and H-IIB and became the basic configuration of Japan&#x27;s liquid fuel launch vehicles for 30 years, from 1994 to 2024.

In 2003, JAXA was formed by merging Japan&#x27;s three space agencies to streamline Japan&#x27;s space program, and JAXA took over operations of the H-IIA liquid-fueled launch vehicle, the M-V solid-fuel launch vehicle, and several observation rockets from each agency. The H-IIA is a launch vehicle that improved reliability while reducing costs by making significant improvements to the H-II, and the M-V was the world&#x27;s largest solid-fuel launch vehicle at the time.

In November 2003, JAXA&#x27;s first launch after its inauguration, H-IIA No. 6, failed, but all other H-IIA launches were successful, and as of February 2024, the H-IIA had successfully launched 47 of its 48 launches. JAXA plans to end H-IIA operations with H-IIA Flight No. 50 and retire it by March 2025.

JAXA operated the H-IIB, an upgraded version of the H-IIA, from September 2009 to May 2020 and successfully launched the H-II Transfer Vehicle six times. This cargo spacecraft was responsible for resupplying the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module on the International Space Station.

To be able to launch smaller mission on JAXA developed a new solid-fueled rocket, the Epsilon as a replacement to the retired M-V. The maiden flight successfully happened in 2013. So far, the rocket has flown six times with one launch failure.

In January 2017, JAXA attempted and failed to put a miniature satellite into orbit atop one of its SS520 series rockets. A second attempt on 2 February 2018 was successful, putting a four kilogram CubeSat into Earth orbit. The rocket, known as the SS-520-5, is the world&#x27;s smallest orbital launcher.

In 2023, JAXA began operating the H3, which will replace the H-IIA and H-IIIB; the H3 is a liquid-fueled launch vehicle developed from a completely new design like the H-II, rather than an improved development like the H-IIA and H-IIB, which were based on the H-II. The design goal of the H3 is to increase launch capability at a lower cost than the H-IIA and H-IIB. To achieve this, an expander bleed cycle was used for the first time in the world for the first stage of the engine.

== Lunar and interplanetary missions ==
Japan&#x27;s first missions beyond Earth orbit were the 1985 Halley&#x27;s comet observation spacecraft Sakigake (MS-T5) and Suisei (PLANET-A). To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth swing by orbits with the Hiten lunar mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter Nozomi (PLANET-B), which was launched in 1998. It passed Mars in 2003, but failed to reach Mars orbit due to maneuvering systems failures earlier in the mission. Currently interplanetary missions remain at the ISAS group under the JAXA umbrella. However, for FY 2008 JAXA is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization. New head for this group will be Hayabusa project manager Kawaguchi.

Active Missions: PLANET-C, IKAROS, &quot;Hayabusa2&quot;, BepiColombo, SLIM
 Under Development: MMX, DESTINY+
Retired: PLANET-B, SELENE, MUSES-C, LEV-1, LEV-2
Cancelled: LUNAR-A

=== Small body exploration: &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission ===
On 9 May 2003, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; (meaning Peregrine falcon), was launched from an M-V rocket. The goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa. The craft rendezvoused with the asteroid in September 2005. It was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in November 2005, after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data. &quot;Hayabusa&quot; returned to Earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 June 2010.

Hayabusa was the world&#x27;s first spacecraft to return asteroid samples to Earth and the world&#x27;s first spacecraft to make a round trip to a celestial body farther from Earth than the Moon.

Hayabusa2 was launched in 2014 and returned samples from asteroid 162173 Ryugu to Earth in 2020.

=== Lunar exploration ===
After Hiten in 1990, JAXA planned a lunar penetrator mission called LUNAR-A but after delays due to technical problems, the project was terminated in January 2007. The seismometer penetrator design for LUNAR-A may be reused in a future mission.

On 14 September 2007, JAXA succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer &quot;Kaguya&quot;, also known as SELENE, on an H-2A rocket (costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle), the largest such mission since the Apollo program. Its mission was to gather data on the Moon&#x27;s origin and evolution. It entered lunar orbit on 4 October 2007. After 1 year and 8 months, it impacted the lunar surface on 10 June 2009 at 18:25 UTC.

JAXA launched its first lunar surface mission SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) in 2023. It successfully soft landed on 19 January 2024 at 15:20 UTC, making Japan the 5th country to do so. The main goal of SLIM was to improve the accuracy of spacecraft landing on the Moon and to land a spacecraft within 100 meters of its target, which no spacecraft had achieved before. SLIM landed 55 meters from the target landing site, and JAXA announced that it was the world&#x27;s first successful &quot;pinpoint landing. Although it landed successfully, it landed with the solar panels oriented westwards, facing away from the Sun at the start of lunar day, thereby failing to generate enough power. The lander operated on internal battery power, which was fully drained that day. The mission&#x27;s operators hope that the lander will wake up after a few days when sunlight should hit the solar panels.

Two rovers, LEV 1 and 2, deployed during hovering just before final landing are working as expected with LEV-1 communicating independently to the ground stations. LEV-1 conducted seven hops over 107 minutes on the lunar surface. Images taken by LEV-2 show that it landed in the wrong attitude with loss of an engine nozzle during descent and even possible sustained damage to lander&#x27;s Earth bound antenna which is not pointed towards Earth. The mission was considered fully successful after confirmation that its primary goal, landing within of the target was achieved, despite subsequent issues.

On 29 January, the lander resumed operations after being shut down for a week. JAXA said it re-established contact with the lander and its solar cells were working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight. After that, SLIM was put into sleep mode due to the approaching harsh lunar night where temperatures reach . SLIM was expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, which lasts for 14 Earth days, and the on-board electronics were not designed to withstand the nighttime temperatures on the Moon. On 25 February 2024, JAXA sent wake-up calls and found SLIM had successfully survived the night on the lunar surface while maintaining communication capabilities. At that time it was solar noon on the Moon so the temperature of the communications equipment was extremely high, so communication was terminated after only a short period of time. JAXA is now preparing for resumed operations, once the temperature has fallen sufficiently. The feat of surviving lunar night without a Radioisotope heater unit had only been achieved by some landers in Surveyor Program.

=== Planetary exploration ===

Japan&#x27;s planetary missions have so far been limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis has been put on magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000 km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter &quot;Akatsuki&quot; (PLANET-C) and IKAROS solar sail demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle.

On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit on 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki&#x27;s main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere&#x27;s super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the troposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found.
JAXA/ISAS was part of the international Laplace Jupiter mission proposal from its foundation. A Japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, JMO (Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter). Although JMO never left the conception phase, ISAS scientists will see their instruments reaching Jupiter on the ESA-led JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission. JUICE is a reformulation of the ESA Ganymede orbiter from the Laplace project. JAXA&#x27;s contribution includes providing components of the RPWI (Radio &amp; Plasma Wave Investigation), PEP (Particle Environment Package), GALA (GAnymede Laser Altimeter) instruments.

JAXA is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the Martian system; a sample return mission to Phobos called MMX (Martian Moons Explorer). First revealed on 9 June 2015, MMX&#x27;s primary goal is to determine the origin of the Martian moons. Alongside collecting samples from Phobos, MMX will perform remote sensing of Deimos, and may also observe the atmosphere of Mars as well. As of December 2023, MMX is to be launched in fiscal year 2026.

=== Solar sail research ===
On 9 August 2004, ISAS successfully deployed two prototype solar sails from a sounding rocket. A clover-type sail was deployed at 122 km altitude and a fan type sail was deployed at 169 km altitude. Both sails used 7.5 micrometer-thick film.

ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub-payload to the Akari (ASTRO-F) mission on 22 February 2006. However the solar sail did not deploy fully. ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the SOLAR-B launch at 23 September 2006, but contact with the probe was lost.

The IKAROS solar sail was launched in May 2010 and successfully demonstrated solar sail technology in July. This made IKAROS the world&#x27;s first spacecraft to successfully demonstrate solar sail technology in interplanetary space. The goal is to have a solar sail mission to Jupiter after 2020.

== Astronomy program ==
The first Japanese astronomy mission was the X-ray satellite Hakucho (CORSA-b), which was launched in 1979. Later ISAS moved into solar observation, radio astronomy through space VLBI and infrared astronomy.

Active Missions: SOLAR-B, MAXI, SPRINT-A, CALET, XRISM
 Under Development:
Retired: HALCA, ASTRO-F, ASTRO-EII, and ASTRO-H
Cancelled(C)/Failed(F): ASTRO-E (F), ASTRO-G (C),

=== Infrared astronomy ===

Japan&#x27;s infrared astronomy began with the 15-cm IRTS telescope which was part of the SFU multipurpose satellite in 1995. ISAS also gave ground support for the ESA Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) infrared mission.

JAXA&#x27;s first infrared astronomy satellite was the Akari spacecraft, with the pre-launch designation ASTRO-F. This satellite was launched on 21 February 2006. Its mission is infrared astronomy with a 68 cm telescope. This is the first all sky survey since the first infrared mission IRAS in 1983.
(A 3.6 kg nanosatellite named CUTE-1.7 was also released from the same launch vehicle.)

JAXA is also doing further R&amp;D for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission, SPICA. This would enable a warm launch without liquid helium. SPICA has the same size as the ESA Herschel Space Observatory mission, but is planned to have a temperature of just 4.5 K and will be much colder. Unlike Akari, which had a geocentric orbit, SPICA will be located at Sun–Earth . The launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on JAXA&#x27;s new H3 Launch Vehicle, however the mission is not yet fully funded. ESA and NASA may also each contribute an instrument. The SPICA mission was cancelled in 2020.

=== X-ray astronomy ===
Starting from 1979 with Hakucho (CORSA-b), for nearly two decades Japan had achieved continuous observation. However, in the year 2000 the launch of ISAS&#x27;s X-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-E failed (as it failed at launch it never received a proper name).

Then on 10 July 2005, JAXA was finally able to launch a new X-ray astronomy mission named Suzaku (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA, because in the five years since the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an x-ray telescope. Three instruments were included in this satellite: an X-ray spectrometer (XRS), an X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS), and a hard X-ray detector (HXD). However, the XRS was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium.

The next JAXA x-ray mission is the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). MAXI continuously monitors astronomical X-ray objects over a broad energy band (0.5 to 30 keV). MAXI is installed on the Japanese external module of the ISS. On 17 February 2016, Hitomi (ASTRO-H) was launched as the successor to Suzaku, which completed its mission a year before.

=== Solar observation ===
Japan&#x27;s solar astronomy started in the early 1980s with the launch of the &quot;Hinotori&quot; (ASTRO-A) X-ray mission. The Hinode (SOLAR-B) spacecraft, the follow-on to the joint Japan/US/UK Yohkoh (SOLAR-A) spacecraft, was launched on 23 September 2006 by JAXA. A SOLAR-C can be expected sometime after 2020. However no details are worked out yet other than it will not be launched with the former ISAS&#x27;s Mu rockets. Instead a H-2A from Tanegashima could launch it. As H-2A is more powerful, SOLAR-C could either be heavier or be stationed at (Lagrange point 1).

=== Radio astronomy ===
In 1997, Japan launched the HALCA (MUSES-B) mission, the world&#x27;s first spacecraft dedicated to conduct space VLBI observations of pulsars, among others. To do so, ISAS set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation. The observation part of the mission lasted until 2003 and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005. In FY 2006, Japan funded the ASTRO-G as the succeeding mission. ASTRO-G was canceled in 2011.

== Communication, positioning and technology tests ==
One of the primary duties of the former NASDA body was the testing of new space technologies, mostly in the field of communication. The first test satellite was ETS-I, launched in 1975. However, during the 1990s, NASDA was afflicted by problems surrounding the ETS-VI and COMETS missions.

In February 2018, JAXA announced a research collaboration with Sony to test a laser communication system from the Kibo module in late 2018.

In January 2025, it was reported that JAXA is collaborating with Japan Airlines and O-Well Corporation to test a riblet-shaped coating on the airline&#x27;s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner that would reduce aerodynamic drag and improve fuel efficiency. The coating is capable of reducing drag by 0.24%, leading to the savings of 119 tons of fuel and 381 tons of CO2 emissions per plane per annum.

Testing of communication technologies remains to be one of JAXA&#x27;s key duties in cooperation with NICT.

Active Missions: INDEX, QZS-1, SLATS, QZS-2, QZS-3, QZS-4, QZS-1R
Under Development: ETS-IX
Retired: OICETS, ETS-VIII, WINDS

=== i-Space : ETS-VIII, WINDS and QZS-1 ===
To upgrade Japan&#x27;s communication technology the Japanese state launched the i-Space initiative with the ETS-VIII and WINDS missions.

ETS-VIII was launched on 18 December 2006. The purpose of ETS-VIII is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an atomic clock test. On 26 December both antennas were successfully deployed. This was not unexpected, since JAXA tested the deployment mechanism before with the LDREX-2 Mission, which was launched on 14 October with the European Ariane 5. The test was successful.

On 23 February 2008, JAXA launched the Wideband InterNetworking engineering test and Demonstration Satellite (WINDS), also called &quot;KIZUNA&quot;. WINDS aimed to facilitate experiments with faster satellite Internet connections. The launch, using H-IIA launch vehicle 14, took place from Tanegashima Space Center. WINDS was decommissioned on 27 February 2019.

On 11 September 2010, JAXA launched QZS-1 (Michibiki-1), the first satellite of the Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a subsystem of the global positioning system (GPS). Three more followed in 2017, and a replacement for QZS-1 is scheduled to launch in late 2021. A next-generation set of three satellites, able to operate independent of GPS, is scheduled to begin launching in 2023.

=== OICETS and INDEX ===
On 24 August 2005, JAXA launched the experimental satellites OICETS and INDEX on a Ukrainian Dnepr rocket. OICETS (Kirari) is a mission tasked with testing optical links with the European Space Agency (ESA) ARTEMIS satellite, which is around 40,000 km away from OICETS. The experiment was successful on 9 December, when the link could be established. In March 2006, JAXA could establish with OICETS the worldwide first optical links between a LEO satellite and a ground station first in Japan and in June 2006 with a mobile station in Germany.

INDEX (Reimei) is a small 70 kg satellite for testing various equipment, and functions as an aurora observation mission as well. The Reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase.

== Earth observation program ==
Japan&#x27;s first Earth observation satellites were MOS-1a and MOS-1b launched in 1987 and 1990. During the 1990s, and the new millennium this NASDA program came under heavy fire, because both Adeos (Midori) and Adeos 2 (Midori 2) satellites failed after just ten months in orbit.

Active Missions: GOSAT, GCOM-W, ALOS-2, GCOM-C, GOSAT-2
Retired/Failed (R/F): ALOS (R), ALOS-3 (F)

=== ALOS ===

In January 2006, JAXA successfully launched the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS/Daichi). Communication between ALOS and the ground station in Japan will be done through the Kodama Data Relay Satellite, which was launched during 2002. This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth Observation Mission. For missions following Daichi, JAXA opted to separate it into a radar satellite (ALOS-2) and an optical satellite, (ALOS-3). ALOS 2 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite was launched in May 2014. The ALOS-3 satellite was aboard a H3 rocket in March 2023, but the satellite was lost in a launch failure when the second stage failed to ignite. ALOS-4, 2&#x27;s SAR successor, was launched successfully in July 2024. A true successor to ALOS-3 is planned to launch around 2027.

=== Rainfall observation ===
Since Japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a very important issue. For this reason Japan launched in 1997 the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons, both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term.

On 28 February 2014, a H-2A rocket launched the GPM Core Observatory, a satellite jointly developed by JAXA and NASA. The GPM mission is the successor to the TRMM mission, which by the time of the GPM launch had been noted as highly successful. JAXA provided the Global Precipitation Measurement/Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM/DPR) Instrument for this mission. Global Precipitation Measurement itself is a satellite constellation, whilst the GPM Core Observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation. Other countries/agencies like France, India, ESA, etc. provides the sub-satellites. The aim of GPM is to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail.

=== Monitoring of carbon dioxide ===
At the end of the 2008 fiscal year, JAXA launched the satellite GOSAT (Greenhouse Gas Observing SATellite) to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The satellite is being jointly developed by JAXA and Japan&#x27;s Ministry of the Environment. JAXA is building the satellite while the Ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected. Since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the world&#x27;s atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe, the GOSAT may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground. Sensors for methane and other greenhouse gasses are also being considered for the satellite, although the plans are not yet finalized. The satellite weighs approximately 1650 kg and is expected to have a life span of five years.

The successor satellite GOSAT 2 was launched in October 2018.

=== GCOM series ===
The next funded Earth-observation mission after GOSAT is the GCOM (Global Change Observation Mission) Earth-observation program as a successor to ADEOS II (Midori) and the Aqua mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, GCOM-W (Shizuku), was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The second satellite, GCOM-C (Shikisai), was launched in 2017.

== Satellites for other agencies ==
For weather observation Japan launched in February 2005 the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R (MTSAT-1R). The success of this launch was critical for Japan, since the original MTSAT-1 could not be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the H-2 rocket in 1999. Since then Japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its useful life term and on American systems.

On 18 February 2006, JAXA, as head of the H-IIA at this time, successfully launched the MTSAT-2 aboard a H-2A rocket. MTSAT-2 is the backup to the MTSAT-1R. The MTSAT-2 uses the DS2000 satellite bus developed by Mitsubishi Electric. The DS2000 is also used for the DRTS Kodama, ETS-VIII and the Superbird 7 communication satellite, making it the first commercial success for Japan.

As a secondary mission both the MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 help to direct air traffic.

== Other JAXA satellites currently in use ==
* GEOTAIL magnetosphere observation satellite (since 1992)
* DRTS (Kodama) Data Relay Satellite, since 2002. (Projected Life Span is seven years)

Ongoing joint missions with NASA are the Aqua Earth Observation Satellite, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core satellite.JAXA also provided the Light Particle Telescope (LPT) for the 2008 Jason 2 satellite by the French CNES.

On 11 May 2018, JAXA deployed the first satellite developed in Kenya from the Japanese Experiment Module of the International Space Station. The satellite, 1KUNS-PF, was created by the University of Nairobi.

== Human spaceflight program ==
Japan has ten astronauts but has not yet developed its own crewed spacecraft and is not currently developing one officially. A potentially crewed spaceplane HOPE-X project launched by the conventional space launcher H-II was developed for several years (including test flights of HYFLEX/OREX prototypes) but was postponed. The simpler crewed capsule Fuji was proposed but not adopted. Projects for single-stage-to-orbit, horizontal takeoff reusable launch vehicle and landing ASSTS and the vertical takeoff and landing Kankoh-maru also exist but have not been adopted.

The first Japanese citizen to fly in space was Toyohiro Akiyama, a journalist sponsored by TBS, who flew on the Soviet Soyuz TM-11 in December 1990. He spent more than seven days in space on the Mir space station, in what the Soviets called their first commercial spaceflight which allowed them to earn $14 million.

Japan participates in US and international crewed space programs including flights of Japanese astronauts on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS. One Space Shuttle mission (STS-47) in September 1992 was partially funded by Japan. This flight included JAXA&#x27;s first astronaut in space, Mamoru Mohri, as the Payload Specialist for the Spacelab-J, one of the European built Spacelab modules. This mission was also designated &quot;Japan&quot;.
Three other NASA Space Shuttle missions (STS-123, STS-124, STS-127) in 2008–2009 delivered parts of the Japanese built spacelab-module &quot;Kibō&quot; to ISS.

Japanese plans for a crewed lunar landing were in development but were shelved in early 2010 due to budget constraints.

In June 2014, Japan&#x27;s science and technology ministry said it was considering a space mission to Mars. In a ministry paper it indicated uncrewed exploration, crewed missions to Mars and long-term settlement on the Moon were objectives, for which international cooperation and support was going to be sought.

On 18 October 2017, JAXA discovered a &quot;tunnel&quot;-like lava tube under the surface of the Moon . The tunnel appears to be suitable as a location for a base of operations for peaceful crewed space missions, according to JAXA.

== Supersonic aircraft development ==
Besides the H-IIA/B and Epsilon rockets, JAXA is also developing technology for a next-generation supersonic transport that could become the commercial replacement for the Concorde. The design goal of the project (working name Next Generation Supersonic Transport) is to develop a jet that can carry 300 passengers at Mach 2. A subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in September and October 2005 in Australia.

In 2015, JAXA performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of supersonic flight under the D-SEND program. The economic success of such a project is still unclear, and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from Japanese aerospace companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries so far.

== Reusable launch vehicles ==
Until 2003, JAXA (ISAS) conducted research on a reusable launch vehicle under the Reusable Vehicle Testing (RVT) project.

== Organization ==
JAXA is composed of the following organizations:
* Space Technology Directorate I
* Space Technology Directorate II
* Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate
* Research and Development Directorate
* Aeronautical Technology Directorate
* Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS)
* Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center (TansaX)

JAXA has research centers in many locations in Japan, and some offices overseas. Its headquarters are in Chōfu, Tokyo. It also has
* Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), Tokyo
* Earth Observation Center (EOC) in Hatoyama, Saitama
* Noshiro Testing Center (NTC) in Noshiro, Akita – Established in 1962. It carries out development and testing of rocket engines.
* Sanriku Balloon Center (SBC) – Balloons have been launched from this site since 1971.
* Kakuda Space Center (KSPC) in Kakuda, Miyagi – Leads the development of rocket engines. Works mainly with development of liquid-fuel engines.
* Sagamihara Campus (ISAS) in Sagamihara, Kanagawa – Development of experimental equipment for rockets and satellites. Also administrative buildings.
* Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Kagoshima – currently the launch site for the H-IIA and H3 rockets.
* Tsukuba Space Center (TKSC) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki. This is the center of Japan&#x27;s space network. It is involved in research and development of satellites and rockets, and tracking and controlling of satellites. It develops experimental equipment for the Japanese Experiment Module (&quot;Kibo&quot;). Training of astronauts also takes place here. For International Space Station operations, the Japanese Flight Control Team is located at the Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center (SSIPC) in Tsukuba. SSIPC communicates regularly with ISS crewmembers via S-band audio.
* Uchinoura Space Center in Kimotsuki, Kagoshima – currently the launch site for the Epsilon rocket.

===Communication ground stations for interplanetary spacecraft===
* Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC) is a spacecraft tracking station in Saku, Nagano (originally in Usuda, Nagano; Usuda merged into Saku in 2005), the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology, and for many years, Japan&#x27;s only ground station for communication with interplanetary spacecraft in deep space. Opening in 1984, the 64 meter antenna, built by Mitsubishi Electric, primarily operated in the X- and S-band frequencies. Upon completion in 2021, MDSS succeeded UDSC as the primary antenna for JAXA&#x27;s Deep Space Network.
* Misasa Deep Space Station (MDSS), also in Saku, Nagano (and just over one kilometer northwest from UDSC), also known as GREAT (Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication) was completed in 2021 at a cost of over ten billion Yen. It is equipped with a 54 meter dish, also built by Mitsubishi Electric, communicating with spacecraft in the X- and Ka-band frequencies. Phase 2 (GREAT2) to improve performance and reliability, in support of future projects, over the previous phase is now in progress.

* Other tracking stations in Okinawa, Masuda, and Katsuura are for satellite tracking and control.

Collaborating with other space agencies:

Previously, JAXA has worked closely with other space agencies in support of their respective deep space projects. Notably, in 2015 NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network provided communication and tracking services to the Akatsuki Venus probe through its 34 meter antennas. In October 2021, JAXA provided NASA with data it had received at Misasa from Juno during its flyby of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa.

As part of on-going joint support of deep space missions JAXA, ESA, and NASA are engaged in an effort to improve the X/Ka celestial reference frame as well as a unified X/Ka terrestrial frame to be shared by the three agencies. 
The 54 meter dish at MDSS enhances X/Ka sensitivity from having an aperture area two and a half times larger than the equivalent antennas in the NASA and ESA network.
MDSS improves the network geometry with the first direct north-south baseline (Japan-Australia) in the X/Ka VLBI network, thereby providing four new baselines which will provide optimal geometry for improving declinations.

<doc id="716188" wikidata="Q4985665" url="?curid=716188" title="Buffalo Bills (quartet)">
<text>The Buffalo Bills were a barbershop quartet formed in Buffalo, New York in 1947. The quartet won the 1950 International Championship and is best known for appearing in the 1957 Broadway production &quot;The Music Man&quot; and its 1962 film version. The quartet was in existence for 20 years, until their last performance in New York City in 1967.

==Origins==
The quartet started out as an unnamed foursome, singing for community groups around Buffalo. The original members were tenor Vern Reed, an executive for the Tonawanda Boys&#x27; Club; lead Al Shea, who was a City of Buffalo policeman; baritone Herschel Smith, a corporate executive; and bass Bill Spangenberg, a truck driver for a steel company. During an appearance at the Buffalo Quarterback Club, the nameless quartet was introduced as the &quot;Buffalo Bills&quot;, which was meant to be just for the occasion, but the name stuck from that day on. Coincidentally, a football team known formerly as the Buffalo Bisons also changed its name to the Bills around the same time; the name proved popular enough that the current Buffalo Bills team also picked up the name when they debuted thirteen years later.

Their coach, Phil Embury, traveled with the quartet around the world. The Bills competed in the 1948 and 1949 Barbershop Harmony Society International Quartet Contests, placing sixteenth and sixth, respectively.

==Champions==
Baritone Herschel Smith left the quartet after he received a job promotion and was transferred to Madison, Wisconsin. Unable to find a suitable replacement, the Bills took an indefinite hiatus. They soon found baritone Dick Grapes and success quickly followed. In 1950, the Bills won the Barbershop Harmony Society International Quartet Contest, earning them the title of International Quartet Champions. Soon after their victory, they appeared on the national radio program &quot;We The People&quot; and were honored by the Manhattan and Buffalo chapters on their return trip to their hometown. Their first national television appearance was on The Faye Emerson Pepsi-Cola Show broadcast on CBS in April 1951. The Bills also performed at military bases in France, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea. That same year of 1951, the Bills released a Long Play record album for Decca Records titled &quot;Barbershop Gems&quot;, which was also issued on 45 and 78 rpm records.

==Discovery==
In the early 1950s, composer and bandleader Meredith Willson hosted a radio program called &quot;Music Today&quot; with his wife, Rini. After listening to the Bills&#x27; records, he began to admire their work, and he and his wife traveled to Buffalo three years later to meet them. Soon, Willson began featuring the quartet regularly on his radio show.

In February 1957, the Buffalo Bills competed on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, won first honors, and received an invitation from Godfrey to perform on his morning show for the rest of the week. Later that year, Meredith Willson finished writing his new musical play, &quot;The Music Man&quot;, which featured a barbershop quartet in the plot. Willson invited the Bills to New York City to audition for the show. They were accepted immediately, but joining the cast of the musical meant they would all have to quit their jobs in Buffalo and relocate to New York City.

==Broadway and film==
After the Bills committed to appear in &quot;The Music Man&quot;, baritone Dick Grapes ultimately decided to stay behind with his job and family life. He was replaced by veteran barbershop baritone Wayne &quot;Scotty&quot; Ward of the Great Scots quartet of Steubenville, Ohio. The foursome took one-year leaves from their jobs (which later became permanent) and moved with their families to New York City. They continued to make television and radio appearances, including &quot;The Arthur Godfrey Show&quot;. &quot;The Music Man&quot; was a hit on Broadway, running for three years and 1,375 performances. Mitch Miller, the director of artists and repertoire for Columbia Records, was a fan of barbershop harmony and signed the quartet to the label. The Bills recorded four albums for Columbia through 1961.

The Bills reprised their stage roles in &quot;The Music Man&quot; for the 1962 film adaptation of the musical. Shortly after the film was completed, bass Bill Spangenberg became ill and was forced to leave the quartet; he died in 1963. Spangenberg was replaced by Jim Jones, bass of the Sta-Laters quartet.

==Final years==
For the next five years, the Buffalo Bills continued to perform regularly on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s show, appeared as a nightclub act, performed in regional and amateur productions of &quot;The Music Man&quot; and were headline entertainers at barbershop conventions and shows, as well as at state and county fairs and festivals around the United States and Canada. Their total career consisted of 1,510 performances on Broadway, 728 concerts, 675 radio shows, 672 night club and hotel appearances, 626 conventions, 218 television shows, 137 state fair performances, eight record albums, and one motion picture. Business disagreements and some health issues among the members led to the disbanding of the quartet in 1967. On May 24, 1967, the Buffalo Bills made their last official appearance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.

Vern Reed and Al Shea were the only members who were with the Buffalo Bills throughout their entire 20-year existence. 
The last surviving member of the quartet is Jim Jones, who lives in Orlando, Florida. Shea died in 1968, Ward in 1989, Reed in 1992, Smith in 2007, and Grapes in 2015.

<doc id="716209" wikidata="Q649599" url="?curid=716209" title="Treaty of 1818">
<text>The Convention respecting fisheries, boundary and the restoration of slaves, also known as the London Convention, Anglo-American Convention of 1818, Convention of 1818, or simply the Treaty of 1818, is an international treaty signed in 1818 between the United States and the United Kingdom. This treaty resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the Oregon Country, known to the British and in Canadian history as the Columbia District of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and including the southern portion of its sister district New Caledonia.

The two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the 49th parallel north, in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom&#x27;s last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the Continental United States and the United States&#x27; first permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power, the second being the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842. The British ceded all of Rupert&#x27;s Land south of the 49th parallel and east of the Continental Divide, including all of the Red River Colony south of that latitude, while the United States ceded the northernmost edge of the Missouri Territory north of the 49th parallel.

==Provisions==

The treaty name is variously cited as
&quot;Convention respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of slaves&quot;,
&quot;Convention of Commerce (Fisheries, Boundary and the Restoration of Slaves)&quot;,
and &quot;Convention of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of America&quot;.

* Article I secured fishing rights along Newfoundland and Labrador for the US.
* Article II set the boundary between British North America and the United States along &quot;a line drawn from the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods, [due south, then] along the 49th parallel of north latitude...&quot; to the &quot;Stony Mountains&quot; (now known as the Rocky Mountains). Britain ceded all territory south of this new boundary, including portions of the Red River Colony and Rupert&#x27;s Land (comprising parts of the present states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota). The United States ceded the portion of the Louisiana Purchase lying north of the 49th parallel (the northernmost portion of the Mississippi River watershed, including those parts of the Milk River, Poplar River, and Big Muddy Creek watersheds in modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan). The article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War. The earlier treaty had placed the boundary between the United States and British North America along a line extending westward from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River. The parties did not realize that the river did not extend that far north and so such a line would never meet the river. In fixing the problem, the 1818 treaty created a pene-enclave of the United States, the Northwest Angle, the small section of the present state of Minnesota that is the only part of the United States apart from Alaska that lies north of the 49th parallel.
*Article III provided for joint control of land in the Oregon Country for ten years. Both could use land and were guaranteed free navigation throughout.
*Article IV confirmed the Anglo-American Convention of 1815, which regulated commerce between the two parties, for an additional ten years.
*Article V agreed to refer differences over a US claim arising from the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, to &quot;some Friendly Sovereign or State to be named for that purpose.&quot; The claim in question was for the return of or compensation for American slaves who had escaped to British-controlled territory or Royal Navy warships when the treaty was signed. The article in question was about handing over property, and the US government claimed that the slaves were the property of its citizens.
*Article VI established that ratification would occur within six months of signing the treaty.

==History==
The treaty was negotiated for the US by Albert Gallatin, ambassador to France, and Richard Rush, minister to the UK; and for the UK by Frederick John Robinson, Treasurer of the Royal Navy and member of the privy council, and Henry Goulburn, an undersecretary of state. The treaty was signed on October 20, 1818. Ratifications were exchanged on January 30, 1819. The Convention of 1818, along with the Rush–Bagot Treaty of 1817, marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for more positive relations between the US and Canada although repelling a US invasion was a defense priority in Canada until 1928.

Despite the relatively friendly nature of the agreement, it resulted in a fierce struggle for control of the Oregon Country for the following two decades. The British-chartered Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by US fur traders to the area. By the 1830s, the policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to US immigrants who had arrived at the post over the Oregon Trail.

By the mid-1840s, the tide of US immigration, as well as a US political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement. The Oregon Treaty in 1846 permanently established the 49th parallel as the boundary between the United States and British North America to the Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="716222" wikidata="Q417351" url="?curid=716222" title="Oxalate">
<text>Oxalate (systematic IUPAC name: ethanedioate) is an anion with the chemical formula . This dianion is colorless. It occurs naturally, including in some foods. It forms a variety of salts, for example sodium oxalate (), and several esters such as dimethyl oxalate (). It is a conjugate base of oxalic acid. At neutral pH in aqueous solution, oxalic acid converts completely to oxalate.

==Relationship to oxalic acid==
The dissociation of protons from oxalic acid proceeds in a stepwise manner; as for other polyprotic acids, loss of a single proton results in the monovalent hydrogenoxalate anion . A salt with this anion is sometimes called an acid oxalate, monobasic oxalate, or hydrogen oxalate. The equilibrium constant (&quot;K&quot;a) for loss of the first proton is (p&quot;K&quot;a = 1.27). The loss of the second proton, which yields the oxalate ion, has an equilibrium constant of (p&quot;K&quot;a = 4.28). These values imply, in solutions with neutral pH, no oxalic acid and only trace amounts of hydrogen oxalate exist. The literature is often unclear on the distinction between , , and , and the collection of species is referred to as oxalic acid.

==Structure==
The oxalate anion exists in a nonplanar conformation where the O–C–C–O dihedrals approach 90° with approximate D2d symmetry. When chelated to cations, oxalate adopts the planar, D2h conformation. However, in the structure of caesium oxalate the O–C–C–O dihedral angle is 81(1)°. Therefore, is more closely approximated by a D2d symmetry structure because the two planes are staggered. Two structural forms of rubidium oxalate have been identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction: one contains a planar and the other a staggered oxalate.

The barrier to rotation about this bond is calculated to be roughly 2–6 kcal/mol for the free dianion, . Such results are consistent with the interpretation that the central C−C bond is regarded as a single bond with minimal π interactions between the two units. This barrier to rotation about the C−C bond (which formally corresponds to the difference in energy between the planar and staggered forms) may be attributed to electrostatic interactions as unfavorable O−O repulsion is maximized in the planar form.

==Occurrence in nature==
Oxalate occurs in many plants, where it is synthesized by the incomplete oxidation of saccharides.

Several plant foods such as the root and/or leaves of spinach, rhubarb, and buckwheat are high in oxalic acid and can contribute to the formation of kidney stones in some individuals. Other oxalate-rich plants include fat hen (&quot;lamb&#x27;s quarters&quot;), sorrel, and several &quot;Oxalis&quot; species (also sometimes called sorrels). The root and/or leaves of rhubarb and buckwheat are high in oxalic acid. Other edible plants with significant concentrations of oxalate include, in decreasing order, star fruit (carambola), black pepper, parsley, poppy seed, amaranth, chard, beets, cocoa, chocolate, most nuts, most berries, fishtail palms, New Zealand spinach (&quot;Tetragonia tetragonioides&quot;), and beans.
Leaves of the tea plant (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;) contain among the greatest measured concentrations of oxalic acid relative to other plants. However, the drink derived by infusion in hot water typically contains only low to moderate amounts of oxalic acid due to the small mass of leaves used for brewing.

===Physiological effects===
Excess consumption of oxalate-rich foods has been linked to kidney stone formation of metal ions, such as calcium oxalate, a risk factor for kidney stones.

Some fungi of the genus &quot;Aspergillus&quot; produce oxalic acid.

==As a ligand for metal ions==

Oxalate also forms coordination compounds where it is sometimes abbreviated as ox. It is commonly encountered as a bidentate ligand. When the oxalate chelates to a single metal center, it always adopts the planar conformation. As a bidentate ligand, it forms a 5-membered ring. An illustrative complex is potassium ferrioxalate, . The drug oxaliplatin exhibits improved water solubility relative to older platinum-based drugs, avoiding the dose-limiting side-effect of nephrotoxicity. Oxalic acid and oxalates can be oxidized by permanganate in an autocatalytic reaction. One of the main applications of oxalic acid is rust-removal, which arises because oxalate forms water-soluble derivatives with the ferric ion.

==Excess==
An excess oxalate level in the blood is termed &quot;hyperoxalemia&quot;, and high levels of oxalate in the urine is termed hyperoxaluria.

===Acquired===
Although unusual, consumption of oxalates (for example, the grazing of animals on oxalate-containing plants such as &quot;Bassia hyssopifolia&quot;, or human consumption of wood sorrel or, specifically in excessive quantities, black tea) may result in kidney disease or even death due to oxalate poisoning. &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; reported acute oxalate nephropathy &quot;almost certainly due to excessive consumption of iced tea&quot; in a 56-year-old man, who drank &quot;sixteen 8-ounce glasses of iced tea daily&quot; (roughly ). The authors of the paper hypothesized that acute oxalate nephropathy is an underdiagnosed cause of kidney failure and suggested thorough examination of patient dietary history in cases of unexplained kidney failure without proteinuria (an excess of protein in the urine) and with large amounts of calcium oxalate in urine sediment. &quot;Oxalobacter formigenes&quot; in the gut flora may help alleviate this.

===Congenital===

Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare, inherited condition, resulting in increased excretion of oxalate, with oxalate stones being common.

<text>Grand Ayatollah Kadhim Husayni al-Haeri () (born 1938) is an Iranian Twelver Shi&#x27;a Marja. He has studied in seminars of Najaf, Iraq under Grand Ayatollah Sadeq al-Sadr. Haeri was born in Karbala, Iraq. He was a top leader of the Al-Da&#x27;wa Party in Iraq. His involvement in the party led to his exile in the 1970s, later he moved to Iran, where he remains to this day in the city of Qom.

==Relationship with Muqtada Al-Sadr==
Al-Haeri is considered the successor to Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, but since al-Haeri has resided in Iran since the 1970s he has not been able to fully take on this position. Despite his exile, he serves as the advisor to the younger al-Sadr on matters of jurisprudence. Thus, al-Haeri is a key source of legitimacy for Al-Sadr. Al-Sadr had previously stated that he would have worked with Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim if Ayatollah al-Haeri had ordered it. Recently, Muqtada al-Sadr and Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim signed a pact to end all potential hostilities between the two camps.

Al-Haeri has also issued fatwas against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but he publicly criticized Muqtada al-Sadr for potential weakening against the Shi&#x27;a establishment and its hierarchy in Najaf under the guise of anti-Americanism in April 2004 while taking Haeri&#x27;s name.

== Resignation ==
On August 29, 2022, al-Haeri announced his resignation from the position of Marja, due to old age and illness. This was described as the first time in history a Marja has ever resigned from his position. However, this is wrong as instances of Maraji resigning in the past exists, like that of Sheikh Muhammad Baqir &quot;Al Waheed&quot; Al Behbahani who, according to Sheikh Osama Aal e Bilal Najafi, resigned and made his student, Sayyid Ali Al Tabatabaei the Marja.

<text>St Peter&#x27;s School is a co-educational private boarding and day school (also referred to as a public school), in the English City of York, with extensive grounds on the banks of the River Ouse. Founded by St Paulinus of York in AD 627, it is considered to be the third-oldest school in the world, although some historians take a more sceptical view. It is part of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and York Boarding Schools Group.

The school accepts pupils aged two to eighteen.

==History==
Originally based at York Minster, the school was founded by St Paulinus of York in the year AD 627, but has not existed continually since that time. An early headmaster, Alcuin (Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus), went on to be Chancellor to the Emperor Charlemagne, and founded several of the earliest schools in mainland Europe. It is considered to be the third oldest school in the world. The school existed near the present day site of the Minster until the seizure of St Mary’s Abbey prompted its reendowment and relocation to the Horsefair, outside of the city walls. During this period three conspirators in the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, Guy Fawkes, John Wright, and Christopher Wright attended the school.

During the English Civil War, the school in the Horsefair was destroyed by the Siege of York. As a result, the school site was moved to the Bedern within the city walls before moving again, in 1730, to St Andrewgate and in 1840 to the Minster Yard. It was only in 1844 that the present site was purchased and the school relocated for the final time.

For most of its history, the school was a boys&#x27; school, but welcomed girls into the sixth form from 1976 before becoming fully coeducational in 1987.

==Campus==
The school grounds are located near the centre of York and stretch to the banks of the River Ouse. The main front of the school faces along Bootham; this is the oldest part of the site.

Boarding Houses Wentworth and Rise border the main campus, while Linton, Dronfield and The Manor are located across the road from the main school front accessible by footbridge. In the 2000s the school expanded its site under Headmaster Andrew Trotman to include the new lower campus, formerly the site of Queen Anne&#x27;s, a state school that had been recently closed. The move was not without its challenges, including the distance between the old and new sites and the dissection of a public footpath.

==St Peter&#x27;s 2–8==

St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 (formerly Clifton Pre-preparatory School) is the pre-prep school to St Peter&#x27;s School, York. St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 is located on the Upper Campus of the school, next door to the senior school which runs along the main road of Bootham in the centre of York. The current Head of St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 is Antonia Clarke.

In February 2018, Clifton School and Nursery was named as the best pre-prep/prep school in the annual TES Independent School Awards.

In summer 2020 Clifton Pre-Preparatory School and Nursery was renamed St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 and, in April 2021, St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 was named the best pre-prep school and independent school of the year in the annual TES Independent School Awards.

==St Peter&#x27;s 8–13==

St Peter&#x27;s 8–13 (formerly St Olave&#x27;s School) is the junior school to St Peter&#x27;s, with grounds on the banks of the River Ouse. The current Head of St Peter&#x27;s 8–13 is Phil Hardy.

St Olave&#x27;s was founded by Reverend Henry Andrew Wilson in 1876 and named after its original site of St Olave’s House in Marygate. The school was acquired by St Peter&#x27;s School in 1901 and St Olave&#x27;s was renamed St Peter&#x27;s 8–13 in 2020.

In September 2001, St Olave&#x27;s moved from the White House (the Chilman Building), and its half of the Queen&#x27;s Building, to the newly acquired Queen Anne site. The pre-prep, St Peter&#x27;s 2–8 (formerly Clifton Prep) moved from its original 19th-century building on The Avenue to occupy the buildings previously used by St Olave&#x27;s.

St Peter&#x27;s 8–13 is now located on the Lower Campus of the St Peter&#x27;s School, which is also home to the senior school Biology and Art Departments.

==Academic==
The school has a history of high academic achievement across all age ranges.

Latin is compulsory for the first three years of study and also offered at GCSE and A Level. Religious Studies is a compulsory GCSE subject.

In the 2017 ISI report, the school academic and other achievements is &#x27;excellent&#x27;, and the quality of pupils&#x27; personal development is &#x27;excellent&#x27;. 

==Extra-curricular Activities==

=== Sport ===
A wide range of activities are available at the school: these include rugby, football, hockey, netball, tennis, cricket, rowing, athletics, basketball, badminton, cross-country, climbing, squash, swimming, weight training, trampolining, water polo and aerobics. The school has sporting fields, gymnasiums, an indoor swimming pool, two multi-sport indoor centres, tennis courts, multi-use astroturf pitches, a rifle range, and a boathouse.

For 27 years, cricket was coached by Keith Mohan. In 2024, the school won the national schools&#x27; T20 Cricket competition after defeating Millfield School at Lord&#x27;s.

In 2002 the school&#x27;s U15 rugby team won the national Daily Mail Cup competition and the U18 team were narrowly beaten in 2005 in the final against Exeter College, Exeter. In 2011 the U16 team won the UCLAN Northern Schools Floodlit Competition and in 2019 the U16 sevens team won the national Rosslyn park competition. Since World War II, the school has had four unbeaten seasons in rugby.

St Peter&#x27;s School Boat Club was founded in the 1850s and is one of the oldest school rowing clubs in the world. It has had success at international level with over 28 GB &#x27;vests&#x27; earned by Peterites since 1998. The school 1st VIII first competed at Henley Royal Regatta in 1968 and has competed in both the Princess Elizabeth and the Fawley. The school has won nine medals at The National Schools&#x27; Regatta, 12 medals at The National Championships and had 25 appearances at Henley (both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s), all since 1991.

The school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force developed from the OTC established at the school in 1913. The school&#x27;s shooting contingent placed in the top three teams of the Marling Challenge Cup at Bisley Imperial meeting five times during the 1960s alone, winning twice, while the highest placing in the Ashburton was third in 1971.

The first recorded inter-school Squash match was held between Haileybury and St Peter&#x27;s in the run up to the first Drysdale Cup. The school won the public schools&#x27; squash (then the Drysdale Cup) twice and came second three times.

=== Music ===
The School Choir averages over 150 members a year, but there is also a more selective Chapel Choir as well as an elite Chamber Choir. Highlights of the choral calendar include the Carol Service at York Minster, as well as Evensongs at the Minster and elsewhere including regular Evensongs at St Paul’s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.

The school has Barbershop Quartets, a Brass Group, Chamber Groups, a Choral Society, a Close Harmony Group, String Orchestras, String Quartets, Swing Band/Traditional Jazz, a Symphony Orchestra, Senior Wind Band, Woodwind, Quintets and Quartets.

After the closure of The Minster School, York in 2019, St Peter&#x27;s 8–13 is now the choir school for the York Minster Choristers.

==Notable Teachers==

*Miggy Biller
*Lowther Clarke
*David Kirby (cricketer)
*Keith Mohan
*Charles Patteson
*Guy Shuttleworth
*Richard Spruce
*George Yeld

==Houses==
The school has ten day and boarding houses, and each house has its own colour. Dronfield (pink) and Rise (white) are girls&#x27; boarding houses; Linton (baby blue) and The Manor (gold) are boys&#x27; boarding houses. The rest are day houses: Clifton (yellow), The Grove (red), Queens (purple), Temple (green), School (maroon), and Hope (orange). The house system is a long-standing tradition throughout the school&#x27;s history. The houses are physical, located in various buildings and parts of buildings throughout the school campus.

==Religion==

The school has a Chapel with compulsory services three mornings a week. Eucharist is also held once a term and there are special services to mark Festivals in the Christian calendar. A service is held on Remembrance Sunday during which all pupils place poppies on the book of remembrance in the Ante-chapel (which contains names of alumni killed in conflict). The school&#x27;s Christmas Carol Service is held in York Minster.

Religious education is compulsory at the school until Sixth Form, and is taught by both academic staff and the school&#x27;s two Church of England clergy.

==York Minster==
York Minster has a long connection with St Peter&#x27;s, as the school&#x27;s founder was an Archbishop of York. This relationship is also evident in the school&#x27;s name, which mirrors the formal title of the Minster, &quot;The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of St Peter&quot;. At its foundation, the school was probably housed next to the earliest cathedral building.

At the end of each academic year a Commemoration and Prizegiving service is held in the Minster and a Carol Service is also held there at Christmas. The school choir often sings in the Minster and in the 2006/2007 year they participated in &quot;Verdi&#x27;s Requiem&quot;, which brought together the wider York community.

St Peter’s School is the home of York Minster’s Choristers, following the closure of the Minster School in 2020.

==Traditions==
*Morning Prayers – all members of the school attend chapel on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays
*Eucharist – a whole school Eucharist service takes place each term and at other significant Christian festivals.
*Uniform – the school has a brown uniform featuring the &quot;cross keys&quot; of St Peter for all pupils (except members of the Sixth Form). The old woollen blazer was later replaced with a more modern cotton jacket. Other changes to the uniform have also taken place, including the removal of ties for female pupils, who now wear an open blouse. In Sixth Form, dark suits must be worn.
*Gowns – the school has a tradition of gowns which reflect pupils&#x27; authority or commitments. These are worn during public events such as services at York Minster and during school events (including Chapel and Assembly). The Head Boy and Head Girl wear brown, followed by the Head Master&#x27;s Prefects who wear navy. These are issued during the &#x27;gowning&#x27; at First Assembly each academic year. Members of the Chapel Committee and choirs wear red gowns, which are fuller depending upon level (Chamber Choir; Chapel Choir; School Choir). School masters also wear collegiate gowns for services and public events.
*Capping – is the practice of reward for exceptional sporting achievement and is awarded at the end of the relevant sports season.
*5 November – on Guy Fawkes Night, the school does not partake in the common tradition of burning a &#x27;Guy&#x27; on the bonfire, as Guy Fawkes was an Old Peterite (alumnus). There is, however, a long tradition of putting on a firework display for the Boarders.
*Fagging – the tradition of younger pupils serving older pupils was abolished in 1977.

==Controversies==

Footpath closure (2006):
In 2006, St Peter&#x27;s School closed a public footpath running through the school grounds using &quot;The Countryside and Rights of Way Act&quot; 2000. This was disputed by local people.

Initiation Rituals:
In 2018 a former pupil reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that boys were subjected to humiliating and painful initiation rituals such as being shot with BB guns, hit in their genitalia with pool cues, and locked in closed spaces for hours at a time. The same pupil also reported being waterboarded with Listerine. Alistair Dunn, the school&#x27;s acting headmaster, said in response that &quot;St Peter&#x27;s is a caring and nurturing school and initiation rites are unacceptable.&quot;

Residential Development:
In 2022, St Peter&#x27;s submitted an application to develop land in the green belt of York, behind the school. The plan would turn green fields on the flood plan into artificial sports fields and a large car and coach park. Over 100 local residents submitted complaints to the council concerning this development. York Central MP Rachael Maskell and local councillors expressed alarm over the impending removal of green belt protection. The plans have since been withdrawn.

Sexual Abuse
Thomas Marriott, who taught History and Rowing at St Peter’s for four years, was found guilty in 2023 of three counts of sexual abuse relating to a teenage student at the school. In mitigation, his barrister noted that he had never received a day of teacher training or any safeguarding training from the school, nor did the school’s safeguarding records show any actions taken with regards to his behaviour. The prosecution barrister quoted a member of staff who stated that they had seen Marriott and the student together in circumstances which should not have occurred but had not seen anything ‘untoward.’ The barrister also noted that the student had looked into getting birth control so that they could have a ‘dirty weekend’ together, and that another member of staff had warned Marriott about his conduct towards the student.

<text>The Chamber of Deputies () is the lower house of Chile&#x27;s bicameral Congress. Its organisation and its powers and duties are defined in articles 42 to 59 of Chile&#x27;s current constitution.

== Eligibility ==
Deputies must: be aged at least 21; not be disqualified from voting; have finished secondary school or its equivalent; and have lived in the corresponding electoral district for at least two years prior to the election.

== Electoral system ==
Since 2017, Chile&#x27;s congress has been elected through open list proportional representation under the D&#x27;Hondt method.

Before 2017, a unique binomial system was used. These system rewards coalition slates. Each coalition could run two candidates for each electoral district&#x27;s two Chamber seats. Typically, the two largest coalitions in a district divided the seats, one each, among themselves. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than two-to-one did the winning coalition gain both seats.
with seats allocated using the simple quotient.
The Chamber of Deputies meets in Chile&#x27;s National Congress located in the port city of Valparaíso, some 120 km west of the capital, Santiago. The Congress building in Valparaíso replaced the old National Congress, located in downtown Santiago, in 1990

== President of the Chamber ==
On 11 March 2022, it was agreed that the Presidency of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies would rotate between the Party for Democracy (PPD), Communist Party (PC), Christian Democratic Party (DC), Party of the People (PDG), the Broad Front (FA) and the Liberal Party (PL). Likewise, the first and second vice-presidencies were assigned to people who are members of the PR, FA, PS, PC, DC and PPD.

<text>The National Congress of Chile () is the legislative branch of the Republic of Chile. According to the current Constitution (Chilean Constitution of 1980), it is a bicameral organ made up of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. Established by law No. 18678, the city of Valparaíso is its official headquarters. 

Chile&#x27;s congress is the oldest operational in Latin America and one of the oldest in Ibero-America. The First Chilean National Congress was founded on July 4, 1811, to decide the best kind of government for the Kingdom of Chile during the captivity of King Ferdinand VII in the hands of Napoleon. 

The Chamber of Deputies is constituted by 155 members called deputies or &quot;diputados&quot; in Spanish and they are elected for a four-years period. Re-election is possible for a maximum of two times, which means that the deputy may remain in the post for up to 12 years. The country has 60 electoral districts and each one is represented by two deputies. 

The Senate is formed by 50 senators elected for an eight-years period and may go for re-election one time, which means a senator can remain in the role for 16 years. The electoral division is different from the deputies, it is made of 19 senatorial constituencies (&quot;Spanish:&quot; &quot;circunscripción senatorial&quot;), where two senators are elected per constituency.

The Congress&#x27;s powers, duties and processes are defined in articles 42 to 59 of the current constitution of 1980 and through the Constitutional Organic Law No. 18918 published in 1990.

The current electoral system (or voting system) in Chile is proportional and inclusive according to the 2015 update of the organic law No. 18700, article 179 bis.

The National Congress was closed without an immediate renewal of the members of its two chambers during three periods: 1924-1925, June-October 1932 and 1973-1989.

A new four-years legislative period begins with the installation of the National Congress. The LVI legislative period of the Chilean Congress began on March 11, 2022 and will end in 2026.

==History==

=== Patria Vieja ===
=== Patria Nueva ===
=== Dictatorship 1973-1990 ===
On 13 September 1973, the Government Junta of Chile dissolved Congress.

During the last years of the Pinochet regime, the current building of Congress was built in the port city of Valparaíso, some 140 km west of the country&#x27;s capital, Santiago. This new building replaced the Former National Congress Building, located in downtown Santiago.

=== Transition to Democracy ===
Between 1989 and 2013, elections in Chile were carried out following a binomial voting system, which was prescribed in 1980 during the Military dictatorship of Chile.

The binomial system was considered by most analysts as the main constitutional lock that prevented completion of the Chilean transition to democracy.

<text>Train of Thought is the seventh studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on November 11, 2003 through Elektra Records.

Inspired by the audience response to Dream Theater&#x27;s heavier songs while on tour, in the &quot;Chaos in Progress&quot; documentary, Portnoy says that they wanted &quot;Train of Thought&quot; to be a &quot;balls to the wall&quot; album with heavier, darker riffing, exposing them to a number of new metal fans. The album was written in three weeks. It was engineered by Doug Oberkircher and mixed by Kevin Shirley. Most of the album was played in concert for the &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; DVD. All songs from it have been played live to date.

==Writing==
As mentioned in videos of the recording/writing sessions, which were filmed by Mike Portnoy, the band &quot;cooped themselves in a rehearsal studio&quot; in New York, and wrote the full album from March 10 through April 3, in a record time of three weeks, after which they began recording, starting with the drum tracks and ending with the vocals.

==Songs==

* The album opens with the same chord that closed the previous album, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;. Similarly, the faint piano note that ends the album is heard at the beginning of the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Octavarium&quot;.
* Some lyrics of &quot;As I Am&quot; were inspired by Dream Theater&#x27;s 2003 summer tour with Queensrÿche, described by Mike Portnoy as an &quot;irksome series of shows.&quot; According to Portnoy, Queensrÿche guitarist Mike Stone tried giving John Petrucci tips on playing guitar, leading Petrucci to write the lyrics: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me what&#x27;s in, tell me how to write&quot;.
* &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; continues Mike Portnoy&#x27;s Twelve-step Suite, which started with &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; on &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; and later continued with &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; on &quot;Octavarium&quot;, &quot;Repentance&quot; on &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot;, and concluded with &quot;The Shattered Fortress&quot; on &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;. These songs share some of the lyrics and melodies. For example, this song features a riff from &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, which is heard at the start of this song&#x27;s step &quot;Release&quot;.
* &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; was written about Mike Portnoy&#x27;s stepfather. When asked about what inspired him to write that song, he stated in an IRC: &quot;I&#x27;m not very good at writing love songs, so I decided to write a hate song!&quot;
* Some of the samples in the instrumental break &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; are taken from Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, in the scene when Jason Robards&#x27; character is talking to Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s character about his regrets in life. There are also parts taken from the film &quot;At Close Range&quot; in which a scene of Sean Penn and Christopher Walken&#x27;s characters can be heard arguing. Other voice samples heard during the bridge were taken from the movies &quot;Ordinary People&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; as well as the TV series &quot;Oz&quot;.
* The lyrics to &quot;Vacant&quot; were inspired by James LaBrie&#x27;s daughter, who fell into a short coma after suffering a sudden, unexplained seizure three days before her seventh birthday.
* &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; is the longest instrumental on a Dream Theater studio album to date and was the intended title for &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot;.
* Between 5:51 and 6:07 of the song &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, there was a hidden composition buried beneath the far louder sounds of the song itself which lay undiscovered for over a year and a half. The band did not tell anyone that a hidden &quot;nugget&quot; (as it became known amongst Dream Theater fans) was present in the song, and only when Mike Portnoy mentioned it in his &quot;Mike Portnoy: Live at Budokan&quot; Drum-Cam DVD over a year later did someone find it. The Mike Portnoy message board was rife with fans scouring the song looking for what it might be, until a fan going by the pseudonymous name &quot;DarrylRevok&quot; mentioned that from 5:51 to 6:07 there appeared to be morse code audible, which Nick Bogovich (user handle &quot;Bogie&quot;) isolated and discovered that when translated to English, the phrase &quot;eat my ass and balls&quot; (a Mike Portnoy catchphrase) was the result.
* From 12:56 onwards of &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, the American Civil War hymn &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; can be heard in the right channel.
* Jordan Rudess played the final note in the album (heard at 14:06 of &quot;In the Name of God&quot;) with his nose as shown in the &quot;Making &quot;Train of Thought&quot;&quot; documentary. Mike Portnoy approved the take while he was filming.

<text>Thomas E. Freston (born November 22, 1945) is an American media proprietor, businessman, and financier.

==Early life and education==
Freston grew up in Rowayton, Connecticut. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Michael&#x27;s College and an MBA from New York University. Freston began his career advertising at Benton &amp; Bowles, which later merged with D&#x27;Arcy. In 1972, after a year of traveling, he moved to South Asia to start a textile and clothing business, Hindu Kush, and worked and lived in New Delhi, India, and Kabul, Afghanistan.

==Career==
Returning to the United States in 1979, he joined the Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment Company (WASEC), a pioneer in the new field of cable television programming. He was one of the founding members of the team that created a music video channel MTV in 1981. As head of marketing, he worked on the &quot;I Want My MTV&quot; ad campaign that helped make the new network a cultural phenomenon. In 1987, he became the president and CEO of MTV Networks, a job he held for 17 years. MTV Networks launched and operated networks including: Nickelodeon, VH1, Comedy Central, TV Land, Spike, CMT, Logo TV, Noggin, and others.

As CEO of MTV Networks, Freston expanded the company&#x27;s reach, built an animation studio, produced feature films, and developed large consumer product and digital businesses. Popular brands and shows included: &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Daria&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;Jackass&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;, &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;Aeon Flux&quot;, &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, &quot;I Love the...&quot;, &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Wonder Showzen&quot;, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;The Real World&quot;, &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (from &quot;Generation&quot; to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;).

===Viacom===
In 2004, after Viacom president and COO Mel Karmazin stepped down, Freston was named co-president and co-COO of Viacom (along with Leslie Moonves). Freston oversaw MTV Networks, Paramount Pictures, Famous Music Publishing, and Simon &amp; Schuster.

On December 31, 2005, Viacom was split into two separate companies – the second Viacom led by Freston, and CBS Corporation headed by Moonves; both CBS Corporation and the second Viacom were under National Amusements administration until 2019.

In September 2006, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone stunned the entertainment industry when he fired Freston from the position of CEO. One of the chief reasons for the move was that Freston had not moved decisively enough to buy MySpace, which was then the most popular social networking site; instead Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation purchased the site for $580 million. Redstone believed that the failure to acquire MySpace contributed to the 20% drop in Viacom&#x27;s stock price in 2006 up to the date of Freston&#x27;s ouster. Freston&#x27;s successor as CEO, Philippe Dauman, was quoted as saying &quot;never, ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy&quot;. Redstone told interviewer Charlie Rose that losing MySpace had been &quot;humiliating,&quot; adding, &quot;MySpace was sitting there for the taking for $500 million.&quot; Murdoch&#x27;s company ended up selling Myspace, which had largely declined along with the rise of rival social networking website Facebook, in 2012; News Corp&#x27;s sale price at the time was $35 million.

===Post-Viacom===
Freston is currently the principal of Firefly3 LLC, a consulting and investment company. In January 2015, he became a senior advisor to The Raine Group, a boutique merchant bank.
==Personal life==
In 1980, Freston married Margaret Ellen Badali. They had two children and later divorced.

In 1998, Freston married Kathy Freston, a former model, self-help author, and health and wellness expert. They divorced in 2014.

<text>Premises are land and buildings together considered as a property. This usage arose from property owners finding the word in their title deeds, where it originally correctly meant &quot;the aforementioned; what this document is about&quot;, from Latin &quot;prae-missus&quot; = &quot;placed before&quot;.

In this sense, the word is always used in the plural, but singular in construction. Note that a single house or a single other piece of property is &quot;premises&quot;, not a &quot;premise&quot;, although the word &quot;premises&quot; is plural in form; e.g. &quot;The equipment is on the customer&#x27;s premises&quot;, never &quot;The equipment is on the customer&#x27;s premise&quot;.

==Law relating to premises==
==Liability of owner of premises in tort==
==Transfer of ownership of premises==
==Premises registration==
Premises registration is &quot;a way to locate where livestock or dead animals are kept or congregated.&quot; In the United States, it is voluntary according to the USDA, but may be mandatory for each state.

As of January 13, 2009 the USDA has entered into the federal register a document which provides for the expansion of implementation of a mandatory national animal identification system to be effective January 2010.

<doc id="716290" wikidata="Q367456" url="?curid=716290" title="Roy Welensky">
<text>Sir Roland &quot;Roy&quot; Welensky (&quot;né&quot; Raphael Welensky; 20 January 1907 – 5 December 1991) was a Northern Rhodesian politician and the second and last Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner mother and a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became involved with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded in the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to South Africa under the apartheid system.

Becoming Prime Minister of the Federation in 1956, Welensky opposed British moves towards black majority rule, and he used force to suppress politically motivated violence in the territories. After the advent of black majority rule in two of the Federation&#x27;s three territories (Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, now Zambia and Malawi, respectively), the Federation collapsed in 1963. Welensky retired to Salisbury, where he re-entered politics and attempted to stop Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia) from unilaterally declaring itself independent. Following the end of white minority rule in 1979, and the recognised independence of Rhodesia as the Republic of Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe in 1980, Welensky emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he died in England in 1991. A fervent admirer of Britain and its Empire, Welensky described himself as &quot;half Jewish, half Afrikaner [and] 100% British&quot;.

==Youth==

Welensky was born in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Michael Welensky (b. &quot;c&quot;. 1843), was of Lithuanian Jewish origin, hailing from a village near Wilno (today Vilnius); a trader in Russia and horse-smuggler during the Franco-Prussian War, he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States, where he was a saloon-keeper, and then South Africa. His mother, Leah (born Aletta Ferreira; &quot;c&quot;. 1865–1918), was a ninth-generation Afrikaner of Dutch and Portuguese ancestry. His parents, for whom Raphael or &quot;Roy&quot; was the thirteenth child, kept a &quot;poor white&quot; boarding house. Welensky&#x27;s mother died when he was eleven years old, being treated by Godfrey Huggins, a doctor who went on to become the prime minister of Southern Rhodesia. Although not of British ancestry, Welensky was intensely pro-British, a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians. John Connell, in his foreword to Welensky&#x27;s book &quot;4000 Days&quot;, wrote: &quot;Welensky, who had not a drop of British blood in his veins, shared this pride and loyalty [towards Britain] to the full.&quot;

After leaving school at the age of fourteen, Welensky found employment with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers&#x27; Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike, Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933, he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.

While working on the railways, he became the professional heavyweight boxing champion of Southern Rhodesia at 19 years old and held the position until he was 21. During this time, Welensky met his first wife, Elizabeth Henderson, who was working at a café in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia at the time. They married after a two-year courtship.

==Colonial politics==

Welensky was elected to the Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council in the 1938 general elections. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia prevented Welensky from enlisting in the armed forces during World War II and appointed him Director of Manpower. In 1941, he formed his own party, the Northern Rhodesian Labour Party, seeking to amalgamate the colony with Southern Rhodesia under a new constitution. The party won all five seats it contested in the 1941 elections. After the leader of the unofficial members in the Legislative Council, Stewart Gore-Browne, resigned in 1945 and stated that black Africans had lost confidence in the whites (due to the wish for amalgamation), Welensky was elected leader. Although a member of the Legislative Council, this was not a full-time job, and he continued working as a train driver for Rhodesia Railways, and also as a Trade Union leader.

==Amalgamation and federation==

From the beginning, Welensky was involved in the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had effectively granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians by specifying franchise qualifications that few blacks had so far achieved - though they were not prevented from acquiring them). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and, against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.

To this end, Welensky organised a conference in February 1949 to investigate the idea of a federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, since both the British and native Africans were opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of &#x27;partnership&#x27; between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that &quot;for as long as I can see, in that partnership [the whites] will be senior partners&quot;.

Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a significant political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral rights and the associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British Crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory had a right to the royalties, and he petitioned the Governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.

In March 1952, the colonial and the British governments met in London to discuss federation. There, the idea for a federation was finalised and settled, although the colonial governments had, again, insisted on amalgamation. They were rebuffed by the left-leaning public servant (later Sir) Andrew Cohen, who, after much deliberation, brought the parties to an agreement. It was acknowledged by those at the meeting that, all too often, the racial policies of the Rhodesias were confused with the emerging apartheid of South Africa, and Welensky himself claimed to refute these ideas when being interviewed by a South African newspaper. He was paternalistic towards native Africans, but believed in the dictum of &quot;equal rights for all civilised men&quot; and gradual advancement.

Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians had been courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans had been doing the same with Labour. A British general election was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best to the idea of federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only with the support of the Conservatives, against opposition from both the Liberal and Labour Parties.

==Federation established==

Welensky stood for the federal legislature in 1953 for the United Federal Party (UFP), created by himself and Southern Rhodesian prime minister Sir Godfrey Huggins. The party was successful in its first election, with twice the votes of the opposition Confederate Party. Welensky himself gained more than 80% of the vote in the federal constituency of Broken Hill and was immediately promoted to Minister for Transport.

The first few years of the federation were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government&#x27;s coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks, and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald MacIntyre.

The Southern Rhodesian Government, under the leadership of Garfield Todd, began removing restrictions imposed on native Africans. The civil service opened more positions to blacks, the title for male Africans was changed from &#x27;AM&#x27; (African male) to &quot;Mr&quot;, and diners and restaurants were allowed to be multiracial; Welensky, as Transport Minister, allowed for railway dining cars to be multiracial. However, when it came to liberalising alcohol restrictions on blacks, Welensky argued against doing so, stating that such an action would cause the UFP to lose the next election. After repeated failed attempts to secure Dominion status for the federation, the prime minister Godfrey Huggins opted not to stand again for his party&#x27;s leadership at their September 1956 conference. Huggins resigned in October, and Welensky, the second-most senior figure in the federal arena, was chosen to replace him. Welensky took office on 1 November.

==Prime minister==

On taking office, Welensky was forced to take sides in the Suez Crisis. The government of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky&#x27;s government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky&#x27;s first experience in international politics. In the aftermath of the Suez debacle, British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the Federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding-up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.

International attitudes to the Federation were critical, particularly from the Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At a time when most colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the Federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.

===Nyasaland unrest===

The Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd visited the Federation in January 1957, while Welensky prepared to outline the difficulties regarding African advancement. Seeking to bring Africans into the established political processes, and hoping they would shun the recently formed African National Congress (ANC) parties, Welensky hit out at what he saw as the poor Colonial Office practice of making the situation &quot;[consist] of two opposed policies, black rule and white rule. They naturally prefer to aim for black rule and hope they will experience this, which they regard as the apotheosis of Colonial Office policy&quot;.

The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was particularly vocal about increased African representation in the Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland&#x27;s inclusion in the Federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily because it was not economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party&#x27;s goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the Federation for its well being.

Hastings Banda, the leader of the Nyasaland nationalist cause, returned to the territory in 1958 and began organising opposition to the Federation. Having lived outside the territory for more than 25 years and having great difficulty remembering his native African language, he required the assistance of interpreters to communicate with the population, whom he stirred into a frenzy with his speeches. After the Governor and the Federal Government refused to give Africans a majority in the Legislative Council, he embarked on a speaking tour of the territory. In January 1959, he stated in a speech that he &quot;put Salisbury [the capital] on fire ... I got Salisbury rocking, rocking, and got it awake out of its political sleep ...&quot;, after which his followers stoned passing cars and police officers.

The federal government met with the territorial governments to plan for a response should the violence get out of hand. Welensky did not rule out deploying federal troops if the situation deteriorated. Speaking to the defence chiefs in Salisbury, he said that &quot;during the next three months we can expect some fairly serious trouble in Nyasaland ... It is my concern to ensure that this government is in a position to exercise its responsibilities if trouble comes&quot;.

A NAC meeting was held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was alleged that the meeting discussed in detail a plan for the overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory&#x27;s whites and any blacks who collaborated with them (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim). Welensky obtained the meeting&#x27;s proceedings in early February and decided to act, calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February, the Governor of Nyasaland proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.

The main militant African nationalist parties in each territory were banned by the federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party (later ZAPU), the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress, and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party. The media&#x27;s use of the term &#x27;police state&#x27; to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.

===Commissions and Macmillan===

In addition to the Royal Commission that investigated the Nyasaland violence (now known as the Devlin Report), the British Government organised a second one, known as the Monckton Report, to advise on the future of the federation. Released in October 1960, the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure, including African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures. Welensky was outraged when the report was published, calling it the &quot;death knell of federation&quot; and rejecting it out of hand. African nationalist opinion was just as opposed, but on different grounds. All nationalists wanted an end to federation, and independence for the territories as black-majority-ruled states. Welensky was opposed to any talk of secession, and the Monckton Report suggested it in writing when it stated that the territories should have the option after five years under a new federal constitution.

Early 1960 saw British prime minister Harold Macmillan journey to the Federation for the first and last time. There, he held talks in person with Welensky and the territorial governments, and he took the opportunity to gauge African opinion towards the Federation. Macmillan also wished to talk to the jailed African leaders, but was met with a rebuff from Welensky. Hastings Banda discussed the probability of his release from prison with the British Government through Labour MP Dingle Foot. Welensky had Banda&#x27;s cell wired for sound and was frustrated with what he saw as the British government&#x27;s &quot;betrayal, duplicity, appeasement, cowardice and loss of nerve&quot; when dealing with the African nationalists and the federation. Macmillan travelled on to South Africa, where he made his &#x27;Wind of Change&#x27; speech to the South African Parliament, raising the attention of South African Prime Minister Dr Hendrik Verwoerd. Welensky was informed that Banda would be released so that he could join in discussions with the British Government over the future of the Federation. Losing patience with the British, Welensky took a harder line against them: &quot;I&#x27;ve tried all along to behave in a reasonable and responsible manner. Now I&#x27;m seriously wondering whether restraint has been the right policy.&quot;

===New constitutions===

After Banda was released from prison against the wishes of Welensky, Banda travelled to the United Kingdom, where he took part in the Nyasaland constitutional talks. The outcome was a constitution which, through a voting system that was as complex as that of the Federation itself, amounted to black majority rule for the territory. Bitter and angry at what he saw as British ignorance to the situation, Welensky did not comprehend how the British were willing to deal with Banda. In Welensky&#x27;s words, since his release from prison, &quot;[Banda] was careful to appeal for calm and to condemn violence&quot;, but Welensky was averse to Banda&#x27;s demands for black majority rule and believed that granting it to the territory would mean the end of the Federation.

In Northern and Southern Rhodesia new constitutions were also enacted. The Southern Rhodesian constitution was very cautious and prolonged white rule. It had 50 A-roll seats with high voting qualifications (essentially for whites), and 15 B-roll seats with lower qualifications (for blacks). A system of &#x27;cross voting&#x27; meant that results in A-roll seats would be affected by the B-roll vote, and vice versa. All constitutions were signed by the UFP and the African nationalist party in each territory. However, there were immediate repercussions; Ian Smith, chief whip for the UFP in the federal assembly, resigned in protest at the new Southern Rhodesian constitution, calling it &quot;racialist&quot;, while the nationalist National Democratic Party withdrew support for the constitution having earlier signed it.

Eventually, Welensky was comfortable with an African majority in Nyasaland and for the province to secede, seeking to preserve only a union of the two Rhodesias but, as a Northern Rhodesian, he did not accept black majority rule for the territory and a battle was had with the British Government over its new constitution throughout 1961–62. In discussions with Smith regarding the concept of Northern Rhodesia under African rule, Welensky stated: &quot;I am not prepared to hand power to the blacks. Personally I could not live in a country where they were in control.&quot;

Welensky considered a federal unilateral declaration of independence when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that, if he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the Federation&#x27;s ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, the idea of a British invasion was one of many options considered, and it did not make it past cabinet discussion.

===Congo, Katanga and Tshombe===

Welensky once told a journalist that he was considering incorporating the Belgian Congo&#x27;s Katanga Province into the Federation. After the Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 as the Republic of the Congo, it collapsed into a state of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the Federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.

The leader of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order. Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the Federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July 1960, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance. Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces, but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky that their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to restore order and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. Welensky decided to support Tshombe, feeling that Katanga could provide a buffer between the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of the Congolese government. Welensky feared Lumumba was supporting black nationalists and communists in the Federation. He argued that &quot;the security of Southern Africa from Communism requires that Katanga be recognised &quot;de facto&quot; by as many countries as possible. Such recognition would strengthen Tshombe&#x27;s hand enormously.&quot;

The Federation provided a key outlet for Tshombe to acquire mercenaries, smuggle weapons and sell Katanga&#x27;s minerals for cash. When the United Nations requested permission to post observers at the Katangese–Rhodesian border to halt the smuggling, Welensky refused to assent. Welensky heavily criticised UN peacekeeping operations in the Congo and the United Kingdom&#x27;s response to the crisis. He used this as a means to mobilize white Rhodesian support for his government as it came under increasing pressure from the white supremacist Rhodesian Front (RF) party for failing to contain black nationalism within the Federation. Welensky stayed in regular communication with Tshombe, although they did not meet in person until late September 1961.

In September, United Nations troops launched Operation Morthor, bringing them into conflict with Katangese forces. Though Welensky had abided by previous instructions from Macmillan to refrain from troop deployments, the British High Commissioner gave him permission this time, and Welensky moved ground troops and most of the RRAF to the frontier. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga&#x27;s secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskjöld&#x27;s plane was shot down from Rhodesian territory close to Ndola in November 1961, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol of colonialism. Other UN officials reached a ceasefire agreement with Tshombe in Ndola, and Macmillan thanked Welensky for facilitating the meeting.

The British government ultimately decided to support the concept of a unified Congo and rallied against Katanga&#x27;s secession. Welensky thought the decision was cynical and displayed weakness in the British Empire. Welensky&#x27;s attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution. When UN troops initiated military action against Katanga in December 1962, Tshombe fled to Salisbury and met with Welensky, vowing to continue the secession. Nevertheless, the Katangese government surrendered in January 1963.

===Territorial and federal elections===

With new constitutions in place for the territories, elections were held throughout 1961–62, and Welensky&#x27;s UFP was beaten in each one. In Nyasaland, the African nationalist Malawi Congress Party won a huge majority, and Banda set about lobbying the British Government for the break-up of the Federation and the independence of Nyasaland as Malawi. In Northern Rhodesia, neither the UFP nor the two African nationalist parties held a majority, but the African nationalists united to push for independence. Welensky hoped to get a display of confidence in the Federation, so he dissolved parliament in mid-1962 and held elections. While his party won a huge victory, it did so because it was completely unopposed. Neither the recently formed RF nor the African nationalist parties bothered to contest it.

In Southern Rhodesia, the UFP lost the hold that it and its successor parties had for decades in the October election. Ian Smith, a former federal member of the UFP, had united with Winston Field of the Dominion Party to form the Rhodesian Front, a conservative party that was opposed to a fast rate of African political advancement and the 1961 constitution, and in support of Southern Rhodesian independence. The RF won 55% of the vote and 35 A-roll seats, while the UFP won 44% of the vote, 15 A-roll seats and 14 B-roll seats. Welensky now had parties in power in all three territorial legislatures that were opposed to the Federation and advocating independence for their respective territories.

===Dissolution===

Since Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia had been promised independence by Britain under &#x27;one man, one vote&#x27; constitutions, the Federation was essentially dead. Southern Rhodesia, still governed by its white minority, was subject to attacks in the United Nations general assembly which regarded its constitution as unsatisfactory. It demanded &#x27;one man, one vote&#x27; elections, stating that this was the only &quot;realistic answer to the powerful and irresistible urge of the indigenous people for freedom and equality&quot;.

Accepting the end of the Federation, Welensky set about ensuring that the assets of the federal government were transferred to Southern Rhodesia, making this a condition of him attending dissolution talks at Victoria Falls. Welensky refused to dine with the British delegates, on the grounds of &quot;not choking on his food&quot;, but ensured that the talks went smoothly. The federation was legally dissolved on 31 December 1963.

==Rhodesian UDI==

Upon the collapse of the Federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. As the Rhodesian Front pushed for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession after the end of the federation).

By the resignation of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel, Welensky was given a chance to re-enter the political arena. Clifford Dupont, Deputy Prime Minister, resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky. Welensky knew that if the RF won the by-elections it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence; the campaign, for only two seats, was intense. At public meetings, Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of &#x27;Communist&#x27;, &#x27;traitor&#x27; and &#x27;coward&#x27;. Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September, Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI, but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London. Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than for his RF opponents, and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks: 

On 1 October, Welensky was soundly defeated by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont&#x27;s 1,079. In December, he resigned the leadership of his party. When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965, Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain. He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government&#x27;s demand for &#x27;no independence before majority rule&#x27;, but was opposed to illegal action.

== Later life and death ==
Welensky continued living in Rhodesia until Robert Mugabe gained power and the country became Zimbabwe in 1980.

While in London in 1971, and by then a widower, Welensky met Miriam Valerie Scott. The couple were married, and went on to have two daughters. They relocated to Blandford Forum, Dorset, in 1981, where he died on 5 December 1991.

<doc id="716311" wikidata="Q133601" url="?curid=716311" title="Murphy J. Foster">
<text>Murphy James Foster (January 12, 1849June 12, 1921) was the 31st Governor of the U.S. state of Louisiana, an office he held for two terms from 1892 to 1900. Foster supported the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, which effectively disfranchised the black majority, who were mostly Republicans. This led to Louisiana becoming a one-party Democratic state for several generations and excluding African Americans from the political system.

Louisiana followed Mississippi (1890) and other southern states in adopting a new constitution with devices to disfranchise blacks, then a majority in the state, chiefly by making voter registration more difficult. This situation of discriminatory political exclusion was not corrected until after enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==Early life==
Foster was born in 1849 on his family&#x27;s sugar cane plantation near Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish, to Thomas J. Foster and the former Martha P. Murphy. His father owned fifty slaves in 1860, marking him as a major planter. Murphy Foster was educated in public schools and attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, and graduated from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1870. He studied law at the University of Louisiana (later Tulane University) in New Orleans and was admitted to the bar in 1871 during the Reconstruction era (United States).

In 1879, Foster &quot;was elected member of the John McEnery legislature, but owing to the fact that this government was never recognized and that the Kellogg government was, did not take his seat.&quot;

On May 15, 1877, Foster married Florence Daisy Hine, the daughter of Franklin merchant T.D. Hine. She died on August 26, 1877, at age 19. In 1881, he married Rose Routh Ker, daughter of Captain John Ker and the former Rose Routh of Ouida Plantation in West Feliciana Parish near Baton Rouge. The couple had ten children, nine of whom lived to maturity. These included Murphy James Foster II, the father of future Governor Murphy (Mike) Foster.

==Road to governorship==

Prior to being elected and serving as governor, Foster served as a state senator from 1880 to 1892. In 1892, he was elected governor as the Democratic Party nominee, and he had the support of the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance, a populist group, as well.

== First term as governor==
His lieutenant governors were Charles Parlange and Hiram R. Lott, during his first term, and Robert H. Snyder of Tensas Parish in the second term.

Foster appointed Thomas M. Wade of Newellton, another Tensas Parish legislator, to the state board of education. Wade later served as the long-term Tensas Parish school superintendent.

Foster appointed William B. Bailey, the co-founder of the &quot;Lafayette Daily Advertiser&quot; and the former mayor of Lafayette as the clerk of the state district court for Lafayette Parish.

In 1896, Foster directed state troopers to forcefully overthrow Louisiana&#x27;s last enclave of Republican and African-American office holders in St. John the Baptist Parish.

==Challenge by John N. Pharr and second term==
In the 1896 general election, Foster was re-elected as the incumbent. He defeated the Republican-Populist fusion candidate John Newton Pharr (1829–1903), a sugar planter from St. Mary Parish. Lewis Strong Clarke, a neighboring sugar planter from St. Mary Parish, directed the Pharr campaign. Pharr had possibly gained a majority of votes cast and won twenty-six of the then fifty-nine parishes, with his greatest strength in north central Louisiana and the Florida Parishes to the east of Baton Rouge.

With the assistance of the Regular Democratic Organization political machine based in New Orleans, Foster officially received 116,116 votes (57 percent) to Pharr&#x27;s 87,698 ballots (43 percent). The election, however, suffered heavily from fraud which benefited Foster, and widespread violence to suppress black Republican voting. A clear accounting of the election results is probably not possible.

Subsequently, as governor, Foster signed off on the new Louisiana Constitution of 1898, establishing a variety of voter registration requirements that would &quot;disenfranchise blacks, Republicans, and white Populists.&quot; (All of these categories of voters had voted overwhelmingly for John N. Pharr, and similar coalitions gained governorships and/or congressional seats in some southern states. The new constitution ensured that Louisiana would become a one-party state, and it was part of the &quot;Solid South&quot; Democratic hegemony for the next six decades.)

After Foster&#x27;s reelection in 1896, Louisiana general elections were non-competitive; the only competition took place in Democratic primaries. Voter rolls were sharply reduced by the new initiatives, and blacks and other groups were excluded from the political system. The white-controlled legislature imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow. As an example of the changed politics, by 1908 when John N. Pharr&#x27;s son Henry Newton Pharr (eponym of Pharr, Texas) sought the Louisiana governorship as a Republican, he gained just 11.1 percent, of a much reduced proportion of voters in comparison to his father&#x27;s campaign against Foster in 1896.

==Senator and customs official==
After leaving the office of governor in 1900, Foster was elected by the state legislature as a U.S. senator. He served until 1913, when he lost the Democratic nomination. Thereafter, he was appointed as the customs collector in New Orleans by President Woodrow Wilson. This Southerner achieved office because he gained an Electoral College bonus following disfranchisement of blacks in the South and hobbling of the Republican Party.

==Death==
Foster died on June 12, 1921, on the Dixie Plantation near Franklin, some nine years before his grandson and namesake, a future governor of the state, was born.

==Legacy==
He was a member of The Boston Club of New Orleans.

Foster worked to maintain white supremacy in Louisiana through his support of the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, which practically disfranchised blacks. He also led the fight which succeeded in outlawing the Louisiana Lottery Co. Foster fought for the interest of sugar growers and supported flood-control legislation and the regulation of railway rates.

Foster was the last governor of Louisiana to serve two consecutive 4-year terms until John J. McKeithen (who served from 1964 to 1972).

Because blacks were disfranchised under his administration, Democratic candidates in the state did not encounter serious challenges from Republicans until 1963. At the beginning of a realignment of party identification in the South, that year John J. McKeithen was challenged by Republican Charlton Lyons. Since the late 20th century, the former Confederate states, where whites constitute a majority, have since generally elected Republican national candidates.

In 1997, Foster was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

His grandson, Murphy J. Foster Jr., served as a Republican governor of the state from 1996 to 2004. &quot;Mike&quot; Foster is technically Murphy J. Foster III, but he uses the term &quot;Jr.&quot; instead.

<text>Mis-Teeq were a British girl group, consisting of Sabrina Washington, Su-Elise Nash and Alesha Dixon. They were active from 1999 to 2005.

Mis-Teeq had two top-ten albums and seven consecutive top-ten singles on the UK Singles Chart, as well as success across Europe, Asia, Australia and the US. Their debut studio album &quot;Lickin&#x27; on Both Sides&quot; on 27 October 2001, peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum.

The album featured the group&#x27;s first five singles, all of which became UK top 10 hits, including their debut single &quot;Why?&quot; with McNally and &quot;All I Want&quot;. On 29 March 2003, following a hiatus, they released their second studio album &quot;Eye Candy&quot;, also a double platinum success. This album featured their biggest international hit &quot;Scandalous&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance charts. The group announced in February 2005 that they would be splitting to pursue solo careers, owing to the demise of their record label Telstar Records. They released a greatest hits album on 25 April 2005 to coincide with their separation.

==History==
===1997–2001: Formation and line-up changes===
Alesha Dixon and Sabrina Washington met in 1997 at Dance Attic studios in Fulham through Louise Porter, who was putting together a group for her production company Big Out Ltd. The two worked with Louise Porter for a couple of years before being joined by Tina Barrett to form a trio performing singing and dancing. They were named Face2Face, were unsigned, and all band members still worked day jobs. Barrett left to join S Club 7 after a successful audition for Simon Fuller and was replaced by Zena McNally and Su-Elise Nash. Their then producer David Brant (writer of their first two hit singles, &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;All I Want&quot;) introduced them via DJ Darren Stokes (TinTinOut) to Inferno Records (sub pop) A&amp;R man Pat Travers, who went on to sign them to Telstar Records and changed their name to Mis-Teeq. After months of recording—including sessions with producers Norwegian duo Stargate along with Brant (Vybrant Music), Ed Case, Blacksmith, Rishi Rich, and Ceri Evans—Mis-Teeq released their debut single in 2001, &quot;Why?&quot;, a Latin-flavoured mid-tempo song co-written and produced by Brant. A garage remix by Matt &quot;Jam&quot; Lamont soon became a success in the underground UK garage scene, and as a result a second music video for the song was filmed and released. &quot;Why&quot; became a hit on the UK Singles Chart with a peak position of number eight. McNally decided to leave the line-up in January 2001 saying she felt unhappy about &quot;an unbalance in the group&quot;.

===2001–2002: &quot;Lickin&#x27; on Both Sides&quot; and touring===
The three remaining members went on to release their second single &quot;All I Want&quot; in June 2001. It was co-written and originally produced by David Brant, and produced and remixed by Ceri Evans (also known as Sunship). The song topped the success of the trio&#x27;s debut single, becoming a number 2 hit in the UK and simultaneously entering the top 30 of the Australian singles chart. The group finally released their debut album &quot;Lickin&#x27; on Both Sides&quot; on 27 October 2001. It was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry on 7 September 2001.

Nevertheless, Mis-Teeq saw instant international success with their Stargate-produced third single &quot;One Night Stand&quot;. While the song peaked at number 5 on the UK singles chart, it also entered the top 20 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. In 2002, the band&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;B with Me&quot;, continued the group&#x27;s remarkable sales with another top 10 entry in the UK; once again entering at number 5. The last release from &quot;Lickin&#x27; on Both Sides&quot; was a double A-side of &quot;Roll on&quot; and the Montell Jordan cover &quot;This Is How We Do It&quot;, latter song being featured on the soundtrack for Ali G&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;. This release entered the charts at number 7 on 29 June 2002. The band supported Shaggy on his UK tour in 2002.

===2003–2005: &quot;Eye Candy&quot;, international breakthrough and split===
Returning from a short hiatus, Mis-Teeq released their second album, &quot;Eye Candy&quot; on 29 March 2003. The album featured production by Stargate, Ed Case, Salaam Remi, singer Joe, Delroy &quot;D-Roy&quot; Andrews, and JD (of the group So Solid Crew) and debuted at its peak position of number 6 on the UK Albums Chart While &quot;Eye Candy&quot;&#x27;s sales failed to link to the sudden success of &quot;Lickin&#x27; on Both Sides&quot;, pre-released lead single &quot;Scandalous&quot; became the group&#x27;s most successful single by then: It reached number 2 in the UK and top 10 in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark.

In June 2003, the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get It Back&quot; became the band&#x27;s seventh and final domestic top-ten single. Originally a remake of the same-titled unreleased Blaque single, Mis-Teeq and Telstar agreed not to use the album version, instead releasing the alternate &quot;Ignorants Radio Edit&quot; as an official single version, which entered the UK charts at number 8 on 12 July 2003. The song also was included on a Special Edition of &quot;Eye Candy&quot; which was released in December of the same year and spawned a third single with &quot;Style&quot;. The song peaked at number 13.

&quot;Scandalous&quot; was released in the US in May 2004 (under another label, Reprise Records) and reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in June, making it their only single to chart in the US. The song was featured as the theme of the film &quot;Catwoman&quot;, starring Halle Berry, in the summer of 2004.

Also in 2004, Mis-Teeq began promoting their music in the US. Following the release of their third album &quot;Mis-Teeq&quot; and the single &quot;Scandalous&quot; in 2004, the band&#x27;s record label Telstar Records went bankrupt, leaving them with no direction.

After the announcement of their split in February 2005, they released a compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, containing a new track, a cover of the Andrews Sisters 1940s song &quot;Shoo Shoo Baby&quot; and were nominated for a 2005 Soul Train Lady of Soul Award.

On 9 February 2011, it was reported that the group was in talks to reform for a comeback tour but Dixon denied this. Two years later, Dixon said that she would never rule out a reunion. In September 2014, Su-Elise stated in an interview with &quot;Fashion Plus Magazine&quot; that the group were in talks and were working on a reunion album.

<text>Thorbräu is one of the oldest breweries in Germany, founded in 1582 in Augsburg, Bavaria. Their beer is brewed in a specific standard that is not a part of the Reinheitsgebot, but of Augsburg&#x27;s own beer purity laws that have been set since 1156, explaining that no version of beer can be brewed using inferior ingredients resulting in an inferior beer.

The more than 400-year-old brewery is located on the edge of Augsburg&#x27;s old town at . This tradition has been continued since 1875 by a 4th generation family. As one of the main proprietors of the regularly held Wertachbruckerthorfest, Thorbräu is clearly committed to an Augsburg tradition that has never faltered, and is still in operation currently. The brewery itself is only a roughly thirty minute travel time to Munich, for the annual Oktoberfest.

<text>Kenneth Stephen Daneyko (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played his entire twenty-season career with the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL), winning three Stanley Cup championships with the team. He has been nicknamed &quot;Mr. Devil&quot; by Devils fans, as he currently holds both the franchise record for games played as a Devil with 1,283 games and in penalty minutes with 2,516. Daneyko now provides colour analysis alongside Bill Spaulding during broadcasts of Devils games on MSG Sportsnet.

==Early years==
Daneyko was born in Windsor, Ontario and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, where he knew Mark Messier from a young age. He is of Ukrainian origin.

==Playing career==

Daneyko was drafted in the first round (18th overall) in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, the second pick of the New Jersey Devils after the franchise relocated from Colorado; when he was drafted the organization had not yet chosen a new team name. He spent several seasons in junior before getting drafted, and played for the Yorkton Terriers of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, as well as the Great Falls Americans, Spokane Flyers and Seattle Breakers of the Western Hockey League. He was called up to the Devils for the start of the 1983–84 season, but cracked his fibula during a game against the Hartford Whalers and missed over 40 games. After his injury healed, he was assigned to the Kamloops Junior Oilers of the WHL for the remainder of the season.

Upon his arrival in the NHL, Daneyko established himself as a stay-at-home defenceman, and soon won fans over with his gritty and self-sacrificing play. Daneyko was also known for his missing front teeth, lost after he was hit in the mouth by a puck. His gap-toothed smile was well known not only by Devils supporters, but by hockey fans around the world. As a player who had spent all of his NHL career with New Jersey, Daneyko was nicknamed &quot;Mr. Devil&quot;. He is also referred to by the nickname &quot;Dano&quot;.
Daneyko acquired over 2,500 penalty minutes in his career, finishing a season with over 200 penalty minutes five times. Daneyko was never a high-scoring defenceman, and set a record by playing in 255 consecutive regular-season games without scoring a goal. In his highest-scoring season, 1989–90, he scored six goals and 15 assists en route to a 21-point season. In six seasons he scored no goals at all. He also has the lowest point per game average among all NHL players who played at least 1,000 games with 0.138. However, Daneyko&#x27;s effectiveness was not measured by how many pucks he put in the net, but by how many pucks he kept out. Daneyko was used primarily as a shadow defenceman, and often got physical in front of the net if a forward parked himself in the crease looking for a rebound.

In the late 1990s, Daneyko struggled with alcoholism while general manager Lou Lamoriello and Devils owner John McMullen stood by him and checked him into rehab. On November 1, 1997, Daneyko became the first player to enter the NHL&#x27;s voluntary Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health program, which was created in 1996. Daneyko recovered and played every game of New Jersey&#x27;s successful 2000 playoffs, winning the Bill Masterton Trophy in 2000.

Along with Scott Stevens, he was part of a Devils defensive core that won the Stanley Cup three times, in 1995, 2000 and 2003. From the team&#x27;s first playoff game while in New Jersey, in 1988, Daneyko played in every playoff game until game four of the 2003 quarterfinals. He also was scratched in the first six games of the 2003 finals, but, looking for a spark, coach Pat Burns inserted Daneyko into the lineup for game seven, replacing Oleg Tverdovsky. As a reward to his devotion of the team, and a hint of his impending retirement, Daneyko took the ice for the final shift of the Devils&#x27; game seven victory over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, which clinched their third Stanley Cup victory, in 2003.

==Post-playing career==

The Devils retired his uniform number, 3, on March 24, 2006. He was the second Devil to receive the honour, after Scott Stevens.

Daneyko currently provides colour commentary on Devils&#x27; broadcasts on MSGSN. Prior to this, he shared commentary and analysis between periods of Devils&#x27; broadcasts and was a regular starring analyst on MSG&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night Live!&quot; with host Al Trautwig and fellow commentators Ron Duguay, Dave Maloney, Mike Keenan, and Butch Goring, as well as &quot;The Hockey Maven&quot; Stan Fischler.

In October 2009, Daneyko began competing as a pairs figure skater on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reality show &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;.

In 2010, Daneyko portrayed himself in the short film &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;, written and directed by Larry Cohen. The film also featured Randy Velischek.

In 2016, Daneyko was inducted into the Ukrainian Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Daneyko was a resident of North Caldwell, New Jersey. He currently lives with his second wife Margaret. Daneyko was previously married to JonnaLyn Panico from 1992 to 2008. The couple had a daughter and a son.

<doc id="716390" wikidata="Q2491774" url="?curid=716390" title="Numbered highways in Ohio">
<text>The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is responsible for the establishment and classification of a state highway network which includes interstate highways, U.S. highways, and state routes. As with other states, U.S. and Interstate highways are classified as state routes in Ohio. There are no state routes which duplicate an existing U.S. or Interstate highway in Ohio.

Ohio distinguishes between &quot;state routes&quot;, which are all the routes on ODOT&#x27;s system, and &quot;state highways&quot;, which are the roads on the state route system which ODOT maintains, i.e. those outside municipalities, with a special provision for Interstate Highways. Besides the state highway network, there are various county and township road networks within the state.

ODOT permits business routes but only &quot;where an ODOT-maintained highway has been constructed on a new alignment which bypasses the CBD [central business district] of a municipality and no other ODOT-maintained highway provides a direct two-way connection between the bypass route and the CBD, or where the existing guide signing does not adequately direct the driver from the bypass route to the CBD and back to the bypass route.&quot;

==History==
The Ohio Inter-County Highways were created on June 9, 1911, with the passage of the McGuire Bill (Senate Bill 165, 79th Ohio General Assembly). Main Market Roads, the most important of the system, were defined on April 15, 1913.

In 1923 the numbering system was simplified. It was altered further in 1927 in order to accommodate numbers in the United States Numbered Highway System.

In 1935 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law which added 5,000 miles of roads to the state highway system over a 12-month period. These roads were assigned route numbers in the 500s, 600s, and 700s.

In 1962 certain numbers were retired to accommodate numbers in the Interstate Highway System.

<doc id="716399" wikidata="Q35918" url="?curid=716399" title="Nu Virgos">
<text>VIA Gra (), known outside of Ukraine and other nearby countries as Nu Virgos, was a Russian/Ukrainian girl group. The name VIA Gra is a triple wordplay; it is an allusion to the drug Viagra, the first three letters &quot;ВИА&quot; (&quot;VIA&quot;) also stand for &quot;vocal-instrumental ensemble&quot; in Ukrainian, and &quot;Гра&quot; (&quot;hra&quot;) means &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot; in Ukrainian, and is also a kind of signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnytsk-A and GR-anovsk-A, the originally used maiden name of Nadia Meiher. Nu Virgos rose to prominence when they hit the charts in the countries of CIS in September 2000, with their debut single &quot;Popytka No. 5&quot; (&quot;Attempt No. 5&quot;). 

Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004, with the single &quot;Stop! Stop! Stop!&quot;, an English version of their 2002 Russian song. The group is known for their frequent lineup changes, with 13 different individuals having at one time been in the group. The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze. Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group&#x27;s albums. Meladze is the writer of the group&#x27;s songs and the co-producer of the group&#x27;s albums.

==History==

=== 2000—2002: Early years ===

In 2000, &quot;Popytka No. 5&quot; with Alena Vinnitskaya and Nadezhda Granovskaya, was released, with &quot;Obnimi menya&quot; (&quot;Hold Me Closer&quot;), &quot;Bomba&quot; (Bomb), &quot;Ya ne vernus&quot; (&quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Back&quot;) following after. By the end of the year, Nu Virgos&#x27; repertoire consisted of seven songs, which was enough to embark on a tour. The group&#x27;s first live performance took place in Dnipropetrovsk, on the stage of the city&#x27;s Ledoviy Palace in front of 4,000 spectators. The group&#x27;s management then decided to release the first full-length album; &quot;Popytka No. 5&quot;.

In 2001, Nu Virgos received some of their first awards; “A Hundred Pood Hit” from HIT FM Radio, “Golden Gramophone” from Russian Radio, and the “Golden Firebird” prize at the Ukrainian annual festival Tavriyski Igry.

In 2002, Granovskaya became pregnant and left temporarily to give birth, during which time Tatiana Naynik took her place. Upon Granovskaya&#x27;s leave, the producers decided to expand the group by adding another member. Therefore, the group became a trio instead of a duet, with the addition of Anna Sedokova, along with a change in their musical direction. In the spring of 2002, the group released their new single; &quot;Stop! Stop! Stop!&quot;, with the success of the song enabling Nu Virgos to take part in the &quot;Ovation&quot; Music Award Ceremony held at the Moscow&#x27;s State Central Concert Hall &quot;Rossiya&quot;. They released the music video for the song the following summer. In September, the song “Good morning, Papa!” and its accompanying music video was released, upon which time Granovskaya had returned, and for the first and only time, four girls were present in the group. The band performed as a four-person band for three months. However, Naynik left Nu Virgos, after the producers came to the conclusion that two brunettes did not belong in the same group. To close that year&#x27;s end, the group&#x27;s members played the roles of foreign princesses in a TV musical called &quot;Zolushka&quot; (Cinderella). At this time, Vinnitskaya felt that her time at the group had come to an end, and so left.

=== 2003—2005: &quot;Golden&quot; era ===
By early 2003, Vera Brezhneva had been cast as the new member of the group, and thus began the &quot;golden&quot; era of Nu Virgos. The group was made up of what was considered the &quot;golden&quot; group of soloists; Nadia Meiher, Vera Brezhneva, and Anna Sedokova. In the beginning of 2003, Nu Virgos released &quot;Ne ostavlyay menya, lyubimiy&quot; (“Don’t Leave Me, Beloved”), complete with an eponymously titled video tape containing a collection of Nu Virgos&#x27; songs. They released &quot;Stop! Snyato!&quot; &quot;(Stop! That&#x27;s a wrap!)&quot;, which included five new songs along with seven remixes. They attended the Russian MUZ TV Awards, in which they won the “Soundtrack” award. In May, the group released the music video for the song &quot;Ubey moyu podrugu&quot; (&quot;Kill My Girlfriend&quot;). By the end of 2003, having completed their new album &quot;Biologiya&quot; &quot;(Biology)&quot;, they entered the international music scene. Their first English-language album &quot;Stop! Stop! Stop!&quot; saw popularity in Israel, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Scandinavian countries. The songs &quot;Okean i tri reki&quot; (&quot;Ocean and Three Rivers&quot;) and &quot;Prityazhenya bolshe net&quot; (&quot;No Attraction Anymore&quot;), both in collaboration with singer Valeriy Meladze, were also released. This was shortly followed by &quot;Biologiya&quot;, with the last two music videos releasing in 2004. In the summer of 2004, Nu Virgos were awarded with the Russian music award &quot;MUZ TV 2004&quot; and completed a world tour spanning territories including South East Asia, Israel and America. In November, the group released two more songs; &quot;Mir, o kotorom ja ne znala do tebya&quot; and English version of the song; &quot;Take You Back&quot;.

In 2004, Sedokova became pregnant, and left the group. She was replaced shortly after, only for a few months, by Svetlana Loboda, who had starred in the video for &quot;Biologiya&quot; alongside Meiher and Brezhneva. Loboda&#x27;s short and turbulent career in Nu Virgos led her to part ways with the group, as fans were appalled by her behaviour during live performances and disappointed that she was replacing Sedokova. After Loboda, Albina Dzhanabaeva appeared as the new member of the group. The year 2005 marked the release of the Russian version of Nu Virgos&#x27; official website, as well as the release of three new music videos; &quot;Net nichego khuzhe&quot;, &quot;I Don’t Want A Man&quot; (English version of &quot;Net nichego khuzhe&quot;) and &quot;Brillianty&quot; (&quot;Diamonds&quot;). Additionally, the group picked up the MUZ TV&#x27;s &quot;The Best Pop Act&quot; award for the second year in a row.

=== 2006—2012: Final years ===
In January 2006, Nu Virgos were a participant at MIDEM 2006. At that time, Granovskaya decided to leave the band in order to start a solo career. At first, she was replaced by Kristina Kotz-Gottlieb, but after staying in the band for only three months, the singer left, according to Kostyuk, because of her quarrelsome nature. In April 2006, she was replaced by Olga Koryahina. Despite the heavy touring that year, the group released four more music videos; &quot;Obmani no ostansya&quot; (&quot;Lie, but Stay&quot;), with Kotz-Gottlieb, &quot;L.M.L.&quot; (Russian and English), and &quot;Tsvetok i nozh&quot; (&quot;Flower and Knife&quot;), both with Koryahina, while also completing a new English album, their second after &quot;Stop! Stop! Stop!&quot;. A second English-language album &quot;L.M.L.&quot; was scheduled for release in November 2006. In early April of 2007, Koryahina left the group due to a pregnancy, and so the label decided to release the English album project digitally. Koryahina was replaced by Meseda Bagaudinova. In July 2007, Brezhneva left the group after she married Mikhail Kiperman, and then went on to host the Russian version of &quot;Power of 10&quot; a year later. In May 2007, Nu Virgos won &quot;Best Group&quot; at the MUZ TV Awards for the second time. On 5 September, Nu Virgos released the music video for the song &quot;Potselui&quot; (&quot;Kisses&quot;) in Ukraine, and on 10 September in Russia. It was the first single since 2001 that the band released as a duet, since at that time it consisted only of Janabayeva and Bagaudinova. On 1 November 2007, the group released a new compilation album called &quot;Potselui&quot; (&quot;Kisses&quot;) featuring 19 tracks. In November, Nu Virgos appeared on the cover of the Russian edition of the male magazine &quot;Maxim&quot;. In December 2007, the group recorded a new song called &quot;Ya ne boyus&#x27;&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Not Afraid&quot;).

In 2008, the group was scheduled to tour for the album &quot;L.M.L.&quot; in variety of countries such as Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The group released a new video in February 2008. In March, Miss Russia 2006, Tatiana Kotova, joined Nu Virgos. In June 2008, Nu Virgos won the award for &quot;Best Group&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; for &quot;Potseluy&quot; for the fourth time at the MUZ TV Awards. In August, their new single &quot;My Emancipation&quot; was released with an accompanying music video. In November, they finished filming a music video for song &quot;Amerikanskaya zhena&quot; (&quot;American Wife&quot;), which was a part of the official soundtrack for the Russian film &quot;Stilyagi&quot;. In the beginning of 2009, Nadezhda Granovskaya decided to return to the band, and the producers decided to replace Bagaudinova with her, despite the fact that she did not want to leave. The group released a new single, along with a music video entitled &quot;Anti-Geisha&quot;. In the autumn of 2009, the group released a new single; &quot;Sumasshedshiy&quot; (&quot;Crazy&quot;). The music video was released in September.

In March 2010, Kotova left the group and was replaced by Yeva Bushmina. In April, a new song and music video were released; &quot;Poshel von&quot; (&quot;Get Out&quot;). In September, &quot;Den&#x27; bez tebya&quot; (&quot;A Day Without You&quot;) was also released. In April 2011, Dmitriy Kostyuk resigned as the group&#x27;s general producer. In November 2011, Meiher (Granovskaya), pregnant once again, left the group and was replaced by Santa Dimopulos. In February 2012, the music video for &quot;Allo, mam!&quot; (&quot;Hello, Mom!&quot;) was released. In September 2012, Santa Dimopulos decided to leave the group, after recording just one single. A month later, it was announced that the group has been placed on hiatus, with no confirmation regarding when they would return and with which members. In December 2012, Konstantin Meladze announced during a press conference that Nu Virgos would cease to exist by January 2013, citing that the group had outlived itself in the format that it was performing in at the given time.

=== 2013—2018: Rebirth ===
Despite initial claims that Nu Virgos would no longer exist as a group, at the beginning of 2013 Meladze announced a casting for his new show; &quot;Хочу V ВИА Гру&quot; &quot;(Khochu V Vya Hru; I want to be in VIA Gra)&quot;. The casting was formatted as a reality TV show, consisting of eight episodes, in which by the end, three new soloists were chosen by popular vote; Erika Herceg, Anastasia Kozhevnikova and Misha Romanova. In November 2013, they released their new single and music video entitled &quot;Peremiriye&quot; (&quot;Truce&quot;). Meanwhile, during Meladze&#x27;s casting show, Kostyuk, the ex-general producer of Nu Virgos, announced his own new lineup. In autumn of 2013, he presented his version of Nu Virgos, which consisted of Darya Rostova, Darya Medovaya and Aina Vilberg. At a show in Kyiv, they performed singles from their new album &quot;Magiya (Magic)&quot;. This caused further tensions between Meladze and Kostuyk, who were already at odds with each other since the dissolution of the old Nu Virgos. In May 2014, the new Nu Virgos released their second single &quot;U menya poyavilsya drugoy&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got Another Man&quot;), featuring Georgian rapper Vakhtang. In 2014, the group was criticized in Ukraine for having accepted awards in Russia, while many Ukrainians believed their country was a victim of Russian aggression. In November 2014, Nu Virgos were featured on a new single released by Russian rapper Mot, titled &quot;Kislorod&quot; (&quot;Oxygen&quot;).

In March 2015, Nu Virgos released their new solo single, &quot;Eto bylo prekrasno&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Been Great&quot;). The song was well received, but critics panned the single, citing that the song sounded relatively similar to many of the group&#x27;s previous works, including &quot;Obmani, no ostan&#x27;sya&quot; (&quot;Lie, but Stay&quot;) and &quot;Ya ne boyus&#x27;&quot; (I&#x27;m Not Afraid&quot;). In July 2015, they released a new compilation album called &quot;Vsё luchsheye v odnom (All The Best In One)&quot;, which featured the most popular Nu Virgos songs throughout the group&#x27;s history. In November, the group released a new single &quot;Tak sil&#x27;no&quot; (&quot;So Much&quot;). They performed this song, along with a medley of previous Nu Virgos&#x27; songs; &quot;LML&quot;, &quot;U menya poyavilsya drugoy&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got Another Man&quot;), &quot;Peremiriye&quot; (&quot;Truce&quot;) and &quot;Sumasshedshiy&quot; (&quot;Crazy&quot;), at the &quot;Big Love Show&quot; on 15 February 2016. In November 2016, the group released a new single entitled &quot;Kto ty mne?&quot; (&quot;Who Are You to Me?&quot;). As all other songs released by the group, the music and lyrics were written by the group&#x27;s producer, Meladze. On October 18, 2017, the single &quot;Moyo serdtse zanyato&quot; (&quot;My Heart is Busy&quot;) was released on &quot;Love Radio&quot;. The official music video for the single was released on 19 November.

On 24 March 2018, at a concert in Tbilisi, the group performed in a new lineup; Anastasia Kozhevnikova, Erika Herceg and Olga Meganskaya. Meganskaya, a singer from St. Petersburg, replaced Misha Romanova, whose maternity leave became known two days before the concert. 

On 24 August 2018, Kozhevnikova got married. During the wedding, she announced that her contract with the group would be ending on 2 September. She stated that she had chosen not to renew the contract due to wanting to pursue a solo career. However, even after the end of the contract, and before the announcement of a new member, the group continued to perform in the old lineup.

=== 2018—2022: New lineups, singles and break-up ===
On 15 September, the group performed at the Agalarov Estate Club in a renewed lineup with Ulyana Sinetskaya. On 5 October, they released a new single; &quot;Ya polyubila monstra&quot; (&quot;I Loved A Monster&quot;), and on 12 November, the music video for the song was released.

On 5 September 2019, the song entitled &quot;Lyubol&quot; (&quot;Love/pain&quot;) premiered on the Meladze Music YouTube channel and on 9 October, they released the music video for the song. On 6 December, the group released the song &quot;1+1&quot; along with a music video.

On 14 May 2020, Herceg announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving the group in December and starting a solo career. In September, she left the band. On 16 October, Meganskaya announced that she was also leaving the group.

On 22 October, a new single &quot;Rikoshet&quot; (&quot;Ricochet&quot;) premiered on &quot;Love Radio&quot;. On 6 November, an updated lineup was revealed on the &quot;Evening Urgant&quot; show. Sinetskaya was joined by the new members of the group; Ksenia Popova and Sofia Tarasova.

On 27 November, the music video for the song &quot;Rikoshet&quot; was released, but it received bad reviews from viewers.

On 28 January 2021, the re-release of &quot;Anti-Geisha&quot; was released. On 16 April, the group released a new song; &quot;Rodnikovaya Voda&quot; (&quot;Spring Water&quot;). On 15 October, they released the song &quot;Maneken&quot; (&quot;Mannequin&quot;), to which the music video was released on 8 December. 

Due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the group disbanded.

<doc id="716401" wikidata="Q1187914" url="?curid=716401" title="Cross-polytope">
<text>In geometry, a cross-polytope, hyperoctahedron, orthoplex, staurotope, or cocube is a regular, convex polytope that exists in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space. A 2-dimensional cross-polytope is a square, a 3-dimensional cross-polytope is a regular octahedron, and a 4-dimensional cross-polytope is a 16-cell. Its facets are simplexes of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope&#x27;s vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.

The vertices of a cross-polytope can be chosen as the unit vectors pointing along each co-ordinate axis – i.e. all the permutations of . The cross-polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. 
The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed unit ball (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the ℓ1-norm on R&quot;n&quot;:
:formula_1

In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is simply the line segment [−1, +1], in 2 dimensions it is a square (or diamond) with vertices {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}. In 3 dimensions it is an octahedron—one of the five convex regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. This can be generalised to higher dimensions with an &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex being constructed as a bipyramid with an (&quot;n&quot;−1)-orthoplex base.

The cross-polytope is the dual polytope of the hypercube. The 1-skeleton of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope is the Turán graph &quot;T&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) (also known as a &quot;cocktail party graph&quot; ).

== 4 dimensions ==

The 4-dimensional cross-polytope also goes by the name hexadecachoron or 16-cell. It is one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes. These 4-polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century.

The vertices of the 4-dimensional hypercube, or tesseract, can be divided into two sets of eight, the convex hull of each set forming a cross-polytope. Moreover, the polytope known as the 24-cell can be constructed by symmetrically arranging three cross-polytopes.

== Higher dimensions ==

The cross-polytope family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as &quot;βn&quot;, the other two being the hypercube family, labeled as &quot;γn&quot;, and the simplex family, labeled as &quot;αn&quot;. A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes, he labeled as &quot;δn&quot;.

The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope has 2&quot;n&quot; vertices, and 2&quot;n&quot; facets ((&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional components) all of which are (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-simplices. The vertex figures are all (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-cross-polytopes. The Schläfli symbol of the cross-polytope is {3,3...,3,4}. 

The dihedral angle of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope is formula_2. This gives: δ2 = arccos(0/2) = 90°, δ3 = arccos(−1/3) = 109.47°, δ4 = arccos(−2/4) = 120°, δ5 = arccos(−3/5) = 126.87°, ... δ∞ = arccos(−1) = 180°.

The hypervolume of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope is 
:formula_3

For each pair of non-opposite vertices, there is an edge joining them. More generally, each set of &quot;k&quot; + 1 orthogonal vertices corresponds to a distinct &quot;k&quot;-dimensional component which contains them. The number of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional components (vertices, edges, faces, ..., facets) in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope is thus given by (see binomial coefficient):
:formula_4

The extended f-vector for an &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex can be computed by (1,2)&quot;n&quot;, like the coefficients of polynomial products. For example a 16-cell is (1,2)4 = (1,4,4)2 = (1,8,24,32,16).

There are many possible orthographic projections that can show the cross-polytopes as 2-dimensional graphs. Petrie polygon projections map the points into a regular 2&quot;n&quot;-gon or lower order regular polygons. A second projection takes the 2(&quot;n&quot;−1)-gon petrie polygon of the lower dimension, seen as a bipyramid, projected down the axis, with 2 vertices mapped into the center.

The vertices of an axis-aligned cross polytope are all at equal distance from each other in the Manhattan distance (L1 norm). Kusner&#x27;s conjecture states that this set of 2&quot;d&quot; points is the largest possible equidistant set for this distance.

== Generalized orthoplex ==
Regular complex polytopes can be defined in complex Hilbert space called &quot;generalized orthoplexes&quot; (or cross polytopes), β = 2{3}2{3}...2{4}&quot;p&quot;, or ... Real solutions exist with &quot;p&quot; = 2, i.e. β = β&quot;n&quot; = 2{3}2{3}...2{4}2 = {3,3..,4}. For &quot;p&quot; &gt; 2, they exist in formula_5. A &quot;p&quot;-generalized &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex has &quot;pn&quot; vertices. &quot;Generalized orthoplexes&quot; have regular simplexes (real) as facets. Generalized orthoplexes make complete multipartite graphs, β make K&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot; for complete bipartite graph, β make K&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot; for complete tripartite graphs. β creates K&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;. An orthogonal projection can be defined that maps all the vertices equally-spaced on a circle, with all pairs of vertices connected, except multiples of &quot;n&quot;. The regular polygon perimeter in these orthogonal projections is called a petrie polygon.

== Related polytope families ==

Cross-polytopes can be combined with their dual cubes to form compound polytopes:

*In two dimensions, we obtain the octagrammic star figure ,
*In three dimensions we obtain the compound of cube and octahedron,
*In four dimensions we obtain the compound of tesseract and 16-cell.

<text>Gander International Airport is located in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and is operated by the Gander International Airport Authority. Canadian Forces Base Gander shares the airfield but is a separate entity from the airport. The airport is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Crossroads of the World&quot;, and is classified as an international airport by Transport Canada.

==History==

===Early years and prominence===
Construction of the airport began in 1936 and it was opened in 1938, with its first landing on January 11 of that year, by Captain Douglas Fraser flying a Fox Moth of Imperial Airways. Within a few years it had four runways and was the largest airport in the world. Its official name until 1949 was &quot;Newfoundland Airport&quot;.

In 1940, the operation of the Newfoundland Airport was assigned by the Dominion of Newfoundland to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and it was renamed &quot;RCAF Station Gander&quot; in 1941. The airfield was heavily used by RAF Ferry Command and Air Transport Command for transporting newly built aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean to the European Theatre, as well as for staging operational anti-submarine patrols dedicated to hunting U-boats in the northwest Atlantic. Thousands of aircraft flown by the United States Army Air Corps through the changeover to the United States Army Air Forces and by the RCAF destined for the European Theatre travelled through Gander.
The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) also established Naval Radio Station Gander at the airfield, using the station as a listening post to detect the transmissions and location of enemy submarines and warships.

Following the war, the RCAF handed operation of the airfield back to the Dominion of Newfoundland government in March 1946, although the RCN&#x27;s radio station remained and the military role for the entire facility was upgraded through the Cold War. The Canadian federal government changed the name to &quot;Gander Airport&quot; after Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. It opened the current passenger terminal in 1959.

===Transatlantic refueling stop===

On 16 September 1945, the first transatlantic proving flight, a Pan Am DC-4, departed Gander for Shannon in western Ireland. On 24 October 1945, the first scheduled commercial flight, an American Overseas Airlines DC-4, passed through Gander.

Following Newfoundland&#x27;s entry into Confederation, the government renamed the airport &quot;Gander International Airport&quot;, and it came under the administration of Canada&#x27;s federal Department of Transport. Numerous improvements were made to the runways and terminals.

Gander is near the great circle route between eastern North America and Europe. Starting in the 1940s it was a refueling stop for transatlantic flights and continued in this role through the early 1960s and in some cases into the 1990s. Carriers at Gander during this era included:

*Aeroflot operated Ilyushin Il-86 widebody flights during the 1980s and early 1990s between Moscow and such long-range destinations as New York and Havana. Due to the IL-86&#x27;s limited range of approximately , the flights would make refueling stops at both Shannon and Gander en route to the final destination. The Boeing 747-200s of the same era had typical ranges from and were much more sought after by international airlines. The IL-86 was used almost exclusively by Aeroflot and successor post-Soviet airlines. 
*Air France ran several services through Gander connecting Paris and Shannon to Montreal, Boston, and New York in the 1950s.
*American Overseas Airlines used Gander as a stop for Lockheed Constellation flights between New York and London from 1947.
*British Overseas Airways Corporation operated Constellations on London-Shannon-Gander-New York, London-Glasgow-Gander-New York, and London-Glasgow-Gander-Montreal routings from 1947. By 1960, the Gander stop was only used as an alternative to a Glasgow or Shannon stop for Bristol Britannia service to Montreal and Toronto.
*Interflug flights between East Germany and Cuba would stop to refuel in Gander, until the airline began using Airbus A310s in 1989. 
*KLM used Gander as a stop on Amsterdam-Glasgow-Gander-New York service from 1946.
*Pan American World Airways used Gander as a stop for transatlantic Douglas DC-4 service between New York-Idlewild and Shannon (continuing to London and Lisbon) starting in 1946. Gander remained in use in 1960 as a stop for Douglas DC-7 services between New York and Scandinavia, although other transatlantic flights bypassed Gander by that point.
*Sabena operated Brussels-Shannon-Gander-New York service from 1949 using Douglas DC-6s.
*Scandinavian Airlines operated Stockholm-Oslo/Copenhagen-Prestwick-Gander-New York service from 1946.
*Trans-Canada Air Lines used Gander as a stop for transatlantic service to London from 1946 and also operated local service from Gander to St. John&#x27;s and Sydney.
*Trans World Airlines operated Boston-Gander-Shannon and Boston-Gander-Azores-Lisbon services from 1947 using Constellations, with onward service to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, and India.

Runway 04/22 was extended from in 1971.

With the advent of jets with longer range in the 1960s, most flights no longer needed to refuel. Gander has decreased in importance, but it remains the home of Gander Control, one of the two air traffic control centres (the other being Shanwick Oceanic Control which is split between two sites – one in Prestwick, Scotland and the other in Shannon, Ireland), which direct the high-level North Atlantic Tracks. Most aircraft travelling to and from Europe or North America must talk to at least one of these air traffic controls.

Some commercial transatlantic flights still use Gander as a refuelling stop; most notably, some American legacy carriers (United Airlines and Delta Air Lines in particular) who use the Boeing 757 to connect smaller European cities with their major US hubs. The 757 is particularly affected in this respect, as it was not an aircraft intended or designed for transatlantic flights. This practice has been controversial, since strong headwinds over the Atlantic Ocean during the winter months can result in the flights being declared &quot;minimum fuel&quot;, forcing refuelling stops at Gander in order to safely complete their journeys.

During the Cold War, Gander was notable for the number of persons from Communist nations who defected there (including Soviet chess player and pianist Igor Vasilyevich Ivanov, Cuban Olympic swimmer Rafael Polinario, and the Vietnamese woman famously photographed as a naked girl fleeing a napalmed village, Phan Thi Kim Phuc). It was one of the few refueling points where the smaller airplanes used by airlines that served the Eastern Bloc could stop en route from Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union to Cuba.

On 12 December 1985, Gander was the site of the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster, in which a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 with 256 on board, mostly soldiers from the US Army 101st Airborne Division, crashed during takeoff, probably due to being overweight and experiencing atmospheric icing; there were no survivors. The crash was, and remains, , the deadliest airplane accident on Canadian soil.

===Gander International Airport Authority===
The &quot;Gander International Airport Authority&quot; (&quot;GIAA&quot;; ) was formed in 1996 by the Government of Canada, which was divesting its direct control of airports across the country to similar operating agencies. Previously, Gander was operated by the Government of Newfoundland from 1938 to 1942 and 1945 to 1949 before transferring to the Government of Canada when Newfoundland became a province. Its mission is to operate the airport in a self-sufficient fashion. It receives its revenues from landing fees on airlines, departure fees on passengers, parking revenues and facility rentals. The revenues are used for operating and capital expenses.

The GIAA only operates the civil airport and does not oversee the nearby Gander (James Paton Memorial Regional Health Centre) Heliport nor CFB Gander.

===Operation Yellow Ribbon (September 2001)===

Following the September 11 attacks on September 11, 2001, with United States airspace closed, Gander International played host to 38 airliners, totaling 6,122 passengers and 473 crew, as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. Gander International received more flights than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation apart from Halifax. The 6,595 passengers and crew accounted for the third highest total of passengers that landed at a Canadian airport involved in the operation, behind Vancouver and Halifax.

A major reason that Gander received so much traffic was its ability to handle large aircraft and because Transport Canada and Nav Canada instructed pilots coming from Europe to avoid major airports in Central Canada, such as Toronto-Pearson and Montréal-Dorval. The reception these travellers received in the central Newfoundland communities near the airport has been one of the most widely reported happy stories surrounding that day.

To honour the people of Gander and Halifax for their support during the operation, Lufthansa named a new Airbus A340-300 &quot;Gander/Halifax&quot; on May 16, 2002. That airplane is listed with the registration D-AIFC, D-AIFC had been diverted to Gander during Operation Yellow Ribbon, and was the first aircraft of that fleet with a city name from outside of Germany.

The airport was the site for Canada&#x27;s memorial service to mark the first anniversary of the attack, over which Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Transport Minister David Collenette, US Ambassador to Canada Paul Cellucci, and provincial and local officials presided. 2,500 of the 6,600 people that were diverted there the year before also attended the ceremony.

The musical stage show &quot;Come from Away&quot; and its film adaptation are based around the experiences of residents of Gander in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and those affected by the forced landings.

==Future==
Officials at Gander International Airport stated in 2006 that the future for the airport is grim unless the federal government provides funding to cover costs. Over 50% of all aircraft operating from the air field are military, and do not pay landing fees. However, domestic passenger traffic increased by over seven percent in 2006, while weekly cargo flights from Iceland show some promise of expansion.

The terminal building—built in the 1950s and noted for its modernist design and heritage architecture—still includes many of its original furnishings and fixtures. In April 2014, Gander Airport Authority made plans to abandon the existing terminal building due to high operating costs and replace it with a new terminal a quarter of the size. In 2017, the airport announced the existing terminal would instead be renovated and downsized, at a cost of $26.4 million.

==Facilities==
===Runways===
Gander has two active runways: runway 13/31 which is , and runway 03/21 (changed from 04/22 in August 2004) which measures and underwent a $10 million comprehensive rehabilitation project, completed in September 2012.

The airport&#x27;s runway 03/21 was designated as an emergency landing runway for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle orbiter. The airport is also an important emergency landing runway for large aircraft in transatlantic operation in the ETOPS system, which requires aircraft to always have less than a certain distance from a suitable landing site. For many two-engine aircraft this is two or three hours with malfunction in one engine.

===Fire services===

Gander Airport Safety and Airside Operations is responsible for fire and rescue operations using three vehicles at their station within the airport. It also has a mutual aid agreement with the Town of Gander Fire Department to provide additional fire fighting services.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Fixed-base operators==
The following fixed-base operators (FBOs) are based at Gander International Airport:

===Public===
*Allied Aviation Services
*Woodward Aviation
*Gander Aviation
*Irving Aviation Services

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 21 February 1941, three people were killed when a Lockheed L-14 Super Electra/Hudson departing from Gander crashed near Musgrave Harbour after both of the plane&#x27;s engines failed. The fatalities include Sir Frederick Grant Banting who died of wounds and exposure. The navigator and co-pilot died instantly, but Banting and the pilot, Captain Joseph Mackey, survived the initial impact. According to Mackey, the sole survivor, Banting died from his injuries the next day.
*On 6 January 1943, a Consolidated Aircraft 28-5MC Canso (PBY-5) of the Royal Canadian Air Force clipped the tops of trees after takeoff and crashed killing five of the seven crew on board.
*On 5 May 1943, a Canadian Vickers PBV-1A Canso A (PBY-5A), CV-241, of the Royal Canadian Air Force lost height and impacted wooded terrain shortly after takeoff from runway 15 killing six of the seven crew on board. 
*On 8 May 1943, a Lockheed C-60A Lodestar of the Royal Canadian Air Force crashed on approach to Gander killing all three crew members. 
*On 4 September 1943, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator &quot;1524&quot;, c/n 589 from No. 10 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force crashed into Gander Lake immediately after takeoff killing the entire crew.
*On 18 September 1946, 27 people died when a SABENA Douglas DC-4 (OO-CBG) crashed 35 km short of Gander Airport, where the aircraft planned to land for a refueling stop on the flight from Brussels to New York. At the time of the accident (07:42 UTC), there was dense fog near the airport, and the pilot executed a flawed approach at too low an altitude. There were 17 survivors (16 passengers and one crew).
*On Wednesday 5 May 1948, a Douglas C-47A-30-DK, &quot;NC17645&quot;, of Superior Oil Company departed from Gander en route to Shannon Airport and disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean with three fatalities.
*On 18 April 1953, a Lockheed Ventura, CF-FAW, with four crew members of Spartan Air Services disappeared after departing Gander on a flight to Ottawa.
*On 25 August 1954, a Lockheed L-749 Constellation &quot;F-BAZI&quot; of Air France of flight AF075 on the Paris–Shannon–Gander–New York–Mexico City route overran the runway and crashed into a ravine upon landing. 
*On Thursday 18 March 1965, Douglas C-47A-30-DK, &quot;N4997E&quot;, of Miami Aviation departed Gander for Santa Maria, Portugal and crashed into the Trinity Bay area killing the two crewmembers on board.
*On 5 September 1967 an Ilyushin Il-18 (registration OK-WAI) of Czechoslovak State Airlines Flight 523 crashed on climbout heading east on runway 13 while on a Prague-Shannon-Gander-Havana passenger service, killing 37 of 69 on board; the cause was never determined.
*On 12 December 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crashed on take-off from the then runway 22. The disaster claimed the lives of all 8 crew members and 248 soldiers of the United States Army&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division who were returning home for Christmas from a peacekeeping deployment in the Middle East. The impact on the south side of the Trans-Canada Highway on the shore of Gander Lake left a charred clearing in the forest where a memorial now stands to those who died in Canada&#x27;s most deadly air crash.
*On 17 December 1998 an Antonov An-124, &quot;RA-82046&quot; of Volga-Dnepr Airlines landed on runway 13 and slid off the runway and came to rest 60 metres from the button of runway 31. The aircraft was embedded in mud and no. 4 engine caught on fire.
*On 10 March 2022, a CH-149 Cormorant of 103 Search &amp; Rescue Squadron crashed during a training exercise, injuring all six crew members.

<text>In geometry, the 16-cell is the regular convex 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schläfli symbol {3,3,4}. It is one of the six regular convex 4-polytopes first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. It is also called C16, hexadecachoron, or hexdecahedroid .

It is the 4-dimesional member of an infinite family of polytopes called cross-polytopes, &quot;orthoplexes&quot;, or &quot;hyperoctahedrons&quot; which are analogous to the octahedron in three dimensions. It is Coxeter&#x27;s formula_1 polytope. The dual polytope is the tesseract (4-cube), which it can be combined with to form a compound figure. The cells of the 16-cell are dual to the 16 vertices of the tesseract.

== Geometry ==
The 16-cell is the second in the sequence of 6 convex regular 4-polytopes (in order of size and complexity).

Each of its 4 successor convex regular 4-polytopes can be constructed as the convex hull of a polytope compound of multiple 16-cells: the 16-vertex tesseract as a compound of two 16-cells, the 24-vertex 24-cell as a compound of three 16-cells, the 120-vertex 600-cell as a compound of fifteen 16-cells, and the 600-vertex 120-cell as a compound of seventy-five 16-cells.

=== Coordinates ===
The 16-cell is the 4-dimensional cross polytope (4-orthoplex), which means its vertices lie in opposite pairs on the 4 axes of a (w, x, y, z) Cartesian coordinate system.

The eight vertices are (±1, 0, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0, 0), (0, 0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, 0, ±1). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs. The edge length is .

The vertex coordinates form 6 orthogonal central squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes. Squares in &quot;opposite&quot; planes that do not share an axis (e.g. in the &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;wz&quot; planes) are completely disjoint (they do not intersect at any vertices). These planes are completely orthogonal.

The 16-cell constitutes an orthonormal &quot;basis&quot; for the choice of a 4-dimensional reference frame, because its vertices exactly define the four orthogonal axes.

=== Structure ===
The Schläfli symbol of the 16-cell is {3,3,4}, indicating that its cells are regular tetrahedra {3,3} and its vertex figure is a regular octahedron {3,4}. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.

The 16-cell is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 orthogonal central squares lying on great circles in the 6 coordinate planes (3 pairs of completely orthogonal great squares). At each vertex, 3 great squares cross perpendicularly. The 6 edges meet at the vertex the way 6 edges meet at the apex of a canonical octahedral pyramid. The 6 orthogonal central planes of the 16-cell can be divided into 4 orthogonal central hyperplanes (3-spaces) each forming an octahedron with 3 orthogonal great squares.

=== Rotations ===

Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space can be seen as the composition of two 2-dimensional rotations in completely orthogonal planes. The 16-cell is a simple frame in which to observe 4-dimensional rotations, because each of the 16-cell&#x27;s 6 great squares has another completely orthogonal great square (there are 3 pairs of completely orthogonal squares). Many rotations of the 16-cell can be characterized by the angle of rotation in one of its great square planes (e.g. the &quot;xy&quot; plane) and another angle of rotation in the completely orthogonal great square plane (the &quot;wz&quot; plane). Completely orthogonal great squares have disjoint vertices: 4 of the 16-cell&#x27;s 8 vertices rotate in one plane, and the other 4 rotate independently in the completely orthogonal plane.

In 2 or 3 dimensions a rotation is characterized by a single plane of rotation; this kind of rotation taking place in 4-space is called a simple rotation, in which only one of the two completely orthogonal planes rotates (the angle of rotation in the other plane is 0). In the 16-cell, a simple rotation in one of the 6 orthogonal planes moves only 4 of the 8 vertices; the other 4 remain fixed. (In the simple rotation animation above, all 8 vertices move because the plane of rotation is not one of the 6 orthogonal basis planes.)

In a double rotation both sets of 4 vertices move, but independently: the angles of rotation may be different in the 2 completely orthogonal planes. If the two angles happen to be the same, a maximally symmetric isoclinic rotation takes place. In the 16-cell an isoclinic rotation by 90 degrees of any pair of completely orthogonal square planes takes every square plane to its completely orthogonal square plane.

=== Constructions ===

==== Octahedral dipyramid ====

The simplest construction of the 16-cell is on the 3-dimensional cross polytope, the octahedron. The octahedron has 3 perpendicular axes and 6 vertices in 3 opposite pairs (its Petrie polygon is the hexagon). Add another pair of vertices, on a fourth axis perpendicular to all 3 of the other axes. Connect each new vertex to all 6 of the original vertices, adding 12 new edges. This raises two octahedral pyramids on a shared octahedron base that lies in the 16-cell&#x27;s central hyperplane.

The octahedron that the construction starts with has three perpendicular intersecting squares (which appear as rectangles in the hexagonal projections). Each square intersects with each of the other squares at two opposite vertices, with &quot;two&quot; of the squares crossing at each vertex. Then two more points are added in the fourth dimension (above and below the 3-dimensional hyperplane). These new vertices are connected to all the octahedron&#x27;s vertices, creating 12 new edges and &quot;three more squares&quot; (which appear edge-on as the 3 &quot;diameters&quot; of the hexagon in the projection), and three more octahedra.

Something unprecedented has also been created. Notice that each square no longer intersects with &quot;all&quot; of the other squares: it does intersect with four of them (with &quot;three&quot; of the squares crossing at each vertex now), but each square has &quot;one&quot; other square with which it shares &quot;no&quot; vertices: it is not directly connected to that square at all. These two &quot;separate&quot; perpendicular squares (there are three pairs of them) are like the opposite edges of a tetrahedron: perpendicular, but non-intersecting. They lie opposite each other (parallel in some sense), and they don&#x27;t touch, but they also pass through each other like two perpendicular links in a chain (but unlike links in a chain they have a common center). They are an example of Clifford parallel planes, and the 16-cell is the simplest regular polytope in which they occur. Clifford parallelism of objects of more than one dimension (more than just curved &quot;lines&quot;) emerges here and occurs in all the subsequent 4-dimensional regular polytopes, where it can be seen as the defining relationship &quot;among&quot; disjoint concentric regular 4-polytopes and their corresponding parts. It can occur between congruent (similar) polytopes of 2 or more dimensions. For example, as noted above all the subsequent convex regular 4-polytopes are compounds of multiple 16-cells; those 16-cells are Clifford parallel polytopes.

==== Tetrahedral constructions ====
The 16-cell has two Wythoff constructions from regular tetrahedra, a regular form and alternated form, shown here as nets, the second represented by tetrahedral cells of two alternating colors. The alternated form is a lower symmetry construction of the 16-cell called the demitesseract.

Wythoff&#x27;s construction replicates the 16-cell&#x27;s characteristic 5-cell in a kaleidoscope of mirrors. Every regular 4-polytope has its characteristic 4-orthoscheme, an irregular 5-cell. There are three regular 4-polytopes with tetrahedral cells: the 5-cell, the 16-cell, and the 600-cell. Although all are bounded by &quot;regular&quot; tetrahedron cells, their characteristic 5-cells (4-orthoschemes) are different tetrahedral pyramids, all based on the same characteristic &quot;irregular&quot; tetrahedron. They share the same characteristic tetrahedron (3-orthoscheme) and characteristic right triangle (2-orthoscheme) because they have the same kind of cell.
The characteristic 5-cell of the regular 16-cell is represented by the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram , which can be read as a list of the dihedral angles between its mirror facets. It is an irregular tetrahedral pyramid based on the characteristic tetrahedron of the regular tetrahedron. The regular 16-cell is subdivided by its symmetry hyperplanes into 384 instances of its characteristic 5-cell that all meet at its center.

The characteristic 5-cell (4-orthoscheme) has four more edges than its base characteristic tetrahedron (3-orthoscheme), joining the four vertices of the base to its apex (the fifth vertex of the 4-orthoscheme, at the center of the regular 16-cell). If the regular 16-cell has unit radius edge and edge length 𝒍 = , its characteristic 5-cell&#x27;s ten edges have lengths , , around its exterior right-triangle face (the edges opposite the &quot;characteristic angles&quot; 𝟀, 𝝉, 𝟁), plus , , (the other three edges of the exterior 3-orthoscheme facet the characteristic tetrahedron, which are the &quot;characteristic radii&quot; of the regular tetrahedron), plus , , , (edges which are the characteristic radii of the regular 16-cell). The 4-edge path along orthogonal edges of the orthoscheme is , , , , first from a 16-cell vertex to a 16-cell edge center, then turning 90° to a 16-cell face center, then turning 90° to a 16-cell tetrahedral cell center, then turning 90° to the 16-cell center.

==== Helical construction ====

A 16-cell can be constructed (three different ways) from two Boerdijk–Coxeter helixes of eight chained tetrahedra, each bent in the fourth dimension into a ring. The two circular helixes spiral around each other, nest into each other and pass through each other forming a Hopf link. The 16 triangle faces can be seen in a 2D net within a triangular tiling, with 6 triangles around every vertex. The purple edges represent the Petrie polygon of the 16-cell. The eight-cell ring of tetrahedra contains three octagrams of different colors, eight-edge circular paths that wind twice around the 16-cell on every third vertex of the octagram. The orange and yellow edges are two four-edge halves of one octagram, which join their ends to form a Möbius strip.

Thus the 16-cell can be decomposed into two cell-disjoint circular chains of eight tetrahedrons each, four edges long, one spiraling to the right (clockwise) and the other spiraling to the left (counterclockwise). The left-handed and right-handed cell rings fit together, nesting into each other and entirely filling the 16-cell, even though they are of opposite chirality. This decomposition can be seen in a 4-4 duoantiprism construction of the 16-cell: or , Schläfli symbol {2}⨂{2} or s{2}s{2}, symmetry [4,2+,4], order 64.

Three eight-edge paths (of different colors) spiral along each eight-cell ring, making 90° angles at each vertex. (In the Boerdijk–Coxeter helix before it is bent into a ring, the angles in different paths vary, but are not 90°.) Three paths (with three different colors and apparent angles) pass through each vertex. When the helix is bent into a ring, the segments of each eight-edge path (of various lengths) join their ends, forming a Möbius strip eight edges long along its single-sided circumference of 4𝝅, and one edge wide. The six four-edge halves of the three eight-edge paths each make four 90° angles, but they are &quot;not&quot; the six orthogonal great squares: they are open-ended squares, four-edge 360° helices whose open ends are antipodal vertices. The four edges come from four different great squares, and are mutually orthogonal. Combined end-to-end in pairs of the same chirality, the six four-edge paths make three eight-edge Möbius loops, helical octagrams. Each octagram is both a Petrie polygon of the 16-cell, and the helical track along which all eight vertices rotate together, in one of the 16-cell&#x27;s distinct isoclinic rotations.
Each eight-edge helix is a skew octagram{8/3} that winds three times around the 16-cell and visits every vertex before closing into a loop. Its eight edges are chords of an &quot;isocline&quot;, a helical arc on which the 8 vertices circle during an isoclinic rotation. All eight 16-cell vertices are apart except for opposite (antipodal) vertices, which are apart. A vertex moving on the isocline visits three other vertices that are apart before reaching the fourth vertex that is away.

The eight-cell ring is chiral: there is a right-handed form which spirals clockwise, and a left-handed form which spirals counterclockwise. The 16-cell contains one of each, so it also contains a left and a right isocline; the isocline is the circular axis around which the eight-cell ring twists. Each isocline visits all eight vertices of the 16-cell. Each eight-cell ring contains half of the 16 cells, but all 8 vertices; the two rings share the vertices, as they nest into each other and fit together. They also share the 24 edges, though left and right octagram helices are different eight-edge paths.

Because there are three pairs of completely orthogonal great squares, there are three congruent ways to compose a 16-cell from two eight-cell rings. The 16-cell contains three left-right pairs of eight-cell rings in different orientations, with each cell ring containing its axial isocline. Each left-right pair of isoclines is the track of a left-right pair of distinct isoclinic rotations: the rotations in one pair of completely orthogonal invariant planes of rotation. At each vertex, there are three great squares and six octagram isoclines that cross at the vertex and share a 16-cell axis chord.

=== As a configuration ===
This configuration matrix represents the 16-cell. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 16-cell. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element.

== Tessellations ==
One can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the 16-cell honeycomb and has Schläfli symbol {3,3,4,3}. Hence, the 16-cell has a dihedral angle of 120°. Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares a tetrahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.

The dual tessellation, the 24-cell honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, is made of regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4} these are the only three regular tessellations of R4.

== Projections ==


The cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.

The cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.

The vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.

Finally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope.

== 4 sphere Venn diagram ==
A 3-dimensional projection of the 16-cell and 4 intersecting spheres (a Venn diagram of 4 sets) are topologically equivalent.

== Symmetry constructions ==
The 16-cell&#x27;s symmetry group is denoted B4.

There is a lower symmetry form of the &quot;16-cell&quot;, called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h{4,3,3}, and Coxeter diagrams or . It can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.

It can also be seen in lower symmetry form as a tetrahedral antiprism, constructed by 2 parallel tetrahedra in dual configurations, connected by 8 (possibly elongated) tetrahedra. It is represented by s{2,4,3}, and Coxeter diagram: .

It can also be seen as a snub 4-orthotope, represented by s{21,1,1}, and Coxeter diagram: or .

With the tesseract constructed as a 4-4 duoprism, the 16-cell can be seen as its dual, a 4-4 duopyramid.

== Related complex polygons ==
The Möbius–Kantor polygon is a regular complex polygon 3{3}3, , in formula_3 shares the same vertices as the 16-cell. It has 8 vertices, and 8 3-edges.

The regular complex polygon, 2{4}4, , in formula_3 has a real representation as a 16-cell in 4-dimensional space with 8 vertices, 16 2-edges, only half of the edges of the 16-cell. Its symmetry is 4[4]2, order 32.

== Related uniform polytopes and honeycombs ==

The regular 16-cell and tesseract are the regular members of a set of 15 uniform 4-polytopes with the same B4 symmetry. The 16-cell is also one of the uniform polytopes of D4 symmetry.

The 16-cell is also related to the cubic honeycomb, order-4 dodecahedral honeycomb, and order-4 hexagonal tiling honeycomb which all have octahedral vertex figures.

It belongs to the sequence of {3,3,p} 4-polytopes which have tetrahedral cells. The sequence includes three regular 4-polytopes of Euclidean 4-space, the 5-cell {3,3,3}, 16-cell {3,3,4}, and 600-cell {3,3,5}), and the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb {3,3,6} of hyperbolic space.

It is first in a sequence of quasiregular polytopes and honeycombs h{4,p,q}, and a half symmetry sequence, for regular forms {p,3,4}.

<text>Sergei Vladimirovich Brylin (; born January 13, 1974) is a Russian professional ice hockey coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). Brylin played with the Devils from 1995 to 2008 and is a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the team.

==Playing career==

Brylin made his NHL debut on February 17, 1995, and scored his first NHL goal on February 27. A versatile, defensive forward capable of playing all three forward positions, Brylin won three Stanley Cups with the New Jersey Devils in 1995, 2000 and 2003. He is one of five Devils who have played for all three of their championship teams, the only others being Martin Brodeur, Scott Niedermayer, Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko.

On July 1, 2008, the Devils turned down the option to have Brylin return for another year. Ten days later, he signed with SKA Saint Petersburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

After hopes of returning to the Devils for one more season faded, Brylin signed with Metallurg Novokuznetsk for the 2011–12 KHL season.

==Coaching career==
Brylin was an assistant coach and associate coach for the Albany Devils (2012–2017), Binghamton Devils (2017–2021) and Utica Comets (2021–2022), the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliates of the New Jersey Devils. In August 2022, he was named an assistant coach of the New Jersey Devils.

==Personal and family life==
Brylin lives in Short Hills, New Jersey, with his wife and three children.

<text>The Copper River or Ahtna River (; , &quot;river of the Ahtnas&quot;; ), &quot;river of copper&quot;, is a 290-mile (470 km) river in south-central Alaska in the United States. It drains a large region of the Wrangell Mountains and Chugach Mountains into the Gulf of Alaska. It is known for its extensive delta ecosystem, as well as for its prolific runs of wild salmon, which are among the most highly prized stocks in the world. The river is the tenth largest in the United States, as ranked by average discharge volume at its mouth.

==Description==
The Copper River rises out of the Copper Glacier, which lies on the northeast side of Mount Wrangell, in the Wrangell Mountains, within Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park. It begins by flowing almost due north in a valley that lies on the east side of Mount Sanford, and then turns west, forming the northwest edge of the Wrangell Mountains and separating them from the Mentasta Mountains to the northeast. It continues to turn southeast, through a wide marshy plain to Chitina, where it is joined from the southeast by the Chitina River (Ahtna Athabascan Tsedi Na&#x27; &lt; &quot;tsedi&quot; &quot;copper&quot; + &quot;na’&quot; &quot;river&quot;).
The Copper River is approximately long. It drops an average of about , and drains more than —an area the size of West Virginia. The river runs at an average of .

Downstream from its confluence with the Chitina it flows southwest, passing through a narrow glacier-lined gap in the Chugach Mountains within the Chugach National Forest east of Cordova Peak. There is an extensive area of linear sand dunes up to in height radiating from the mouth of the Copper River. Both Miles Glacier and Childs Glacier calve directly into the river. The Copper enters the Gulf of Alaska southeast of Cordova where it creates a delta nearly wide.

==History==

The name of the river comes from the abundant copper deposits along the upper river that were used by Alaska Native population and then later by settlers from the Russian Empire and the United States. Extraction of the copper resources was problematic due to navigation difficulties at the river&#x27;s mouth. The construction of the Copper River and Northwestern Railway from Cordova through the upper river valley from 1908 to 1911 allowed widespread extraction of the mineral resources, in particular from the Kennecott Mine, discovered in 1898. The mine was abandoned in 1938 and is now a ghost town tourist attraction and historic district maintained by the National Park Service.

Copper River Highway (Alaska Route 10) runs from Cordova to the lower Copper River near Childs Glacier, following the old railroad route and ending at the reconstructed Million Dollar Bridge across the river. The Tok Cut-Off (Alaska Route 1) follows the Copper River Valley on the north side of the Chugach Mountains.

The river&#x27;s famous salmon runs arise from the use of the river watershed by over 2 million salmon each year for spawning. The extensive runs result in many unique varieties, prized for their fat content. The river&#x27;s commercial salmon season is very brief, beginning in May for chinook salmon, and sockeye salmon for periods lasting mere hours or several days at a time. Sport fishing by contrast is open all year-long, but peak season on the Copper River lasts from August to September, when the coho salmon runs. The fisheries are co-managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) and the Department of the Interior Federal Subsistence Board. Management data is obtained primarily by ADF&amp;G at the Miles Lake sonar station and via the native village of Eyak at the Baird Canyon and Canyon Creek research stations.

==Birding==

The Copper River Delta, which extends for 700,000 acres (2,800 km2), is the largest contiguous wetlands along the Pacific coast of North America. It is used annually by 16 million shorebirds, including the world&#x27;s entire population of western sandpipers and the pacific flyway population of dunlins. It is also home to the world&#x27;s largest population of nesting trumpeter swans and is the only known nesting site for the dusky Canada goose subspecies (&quot;Branta canadensis occidentalis&quot;).

<text>Seychelles International Airport , or &quot;Aéroport de la Pointe Larue&quot; in French, is the international airport of the Seychelles located on the island of Mahé near the capital city of Victoria. The airport is the home base and the head office of Air Seychelles and features several regional and long-haul routes due to its importance as the gateway to a major international leisure destination.

The airport is southeast of the capital and is accessible by the Victoria-Providence Highway. It forms part of the administrative districts of La Pointe Larue (terminal area), Cascade/Providence (in the North), and Anse aux Pins (in the south and military base).

==Terminals==

The domestic terminal is a short distance north of the international terminal and offers inter-island flights with a peak of a departure every 10–15 minutes at busy times which corresponds with international arrivals/departures and every 30 minutes at other times.
A cargo terminal is south of the international terminal and handles freight from all international and domestic movements; it is run by Air Seychelles.

A base of the Seychelles Public Defence Force (SPDF) is at the southeastern end of Runway 13 on an island that was joined with Mahé at the construction of the airport.

==History==

===Early years===
The opening of the Seychelles International Airport took place on 20 March 1972 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Wilkenair of Kenya had, however, already started a ferry service between Mombasa and Mahé via Diego Suarez in Madagascar and Astove Island (Seychelles) using a twin engine Piper Navajo the previous year. It operated to the Seychelles once a week. The first pilot to land at Seychelles airport was Tony Bentley-Buckle, who flew his private plane from Mombasa to Mahe via Moroni in March 1971 even before the airfield was complete. The flying time was 9 hours 35 minutes.

This was followed by East African Airways in November 1971 and Luxair in December of the same year. A BOAC Super VC10 was the first jet aircraft to land at Seychelles International Airport on 4 July 1971. At the time of the opening it had a 2987 m runway and a control tower. Ground handling and all other airport operations were carried out by the DCA (Directorate of Civil Aviation).

In 1972, John Faulkner Taylor and Tony Bentley-Buckle founded the first local aircraft company Air Mahé, which operated a Piper PA-34 Seneca between Praslin, Fregate, and Mahé Islands. This aircraft was later replaced by a Britten-Norman Islander. By 1974, over 30 airlines were flying to the Seychelles. Ground handling and all airport operations were being carried out by Aviation Seychelles Company, a company formed in 1973.

Construction works for the substantial expansion of the airport started in July 1980 Due to the continuous increase in passenger traffic, a terminal building was built that could cater for 400 more arriving and 400 more departing passengers at any time. Parking bays for up to six large aircraft were built and a parking area for five light aircraft.

In 1981, there was a gun battle at Seychelles International Airport, as British national Mike Hoare led a team of 43 South African mercenaries masquerading as holidaying rugby players in a coup attempt in what is known as the Seychelles affair. After their hidden weapons were discovered on arrival a skirmish ensued, with most of the mercenaries later escaping in a hijacked Air India jet.

===Development since the 2000s===

The years 2005 and 2006 brought further development of civil aviation in the Seychelles. The Civil Aviation Authority Act was enacted on 4 April 2006 for the corporatisation of the Directorate of Civil Aviation to Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority. Works started to upgrade and extend the terminal building, which has been further extended to handle at least five medium to large jet aircraft (e.g., Boeing 767 or Airbus A330) as well as six smaller jet aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus A320).

Additional parking areas were made available to the north-east of the airport to handle the parking of charter, business, and long stay aircraft (e.g. some European flights arrive in the morning starting at 7 a.m. but do not depart until 10 p.m. onwards). This reduces jet-lag as any flight that leaves Seychelles at night will get to most Western European cities in the early morning and vice versa from the European cities to the Seychelles; it also provides sufficient rest for operating crews.

The airport has been home to unmanned aerial vehicles operated by the United States Air Force and possibly the Central Intelligence Agency for operations over Somalia and the Horn of Africa. President of Seychelles James Michel apparently welcomed the presence of U.S. drones in Seychelles to combat Somalian piracy and terrorism, dating back to at least August 2009. At least two MQ-9 Reaper UAVs have crashed into the Indian Ocean near the airport since December 2011.

==Airlines and destinations==


==Statistics==

==Ground transport==
There is frequent service to the bus station in Victoria, with taxi ranks outside the terminal available to all locations on Mahé Island. Several tour operators&#x27; coach services also link passengers to the ferry terminal at the Old Port (Vieux Port) for inter-island ferry services and to the New Port (Nouveau port) for cruise holidays.

<doc id="716446" wikidata="Q1304505" url="?curid=716446" title="Ohio State Route 21">
<text>State Route 21 (SR 21) is a north–south state highway in northeastern Ohio. The southern terminus is north of Strasburg on U.S. Route 250. The northern terminus is at an interchange with Interstate 77 in Cuyahoga Heights.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of SR 21 is on US 250 in Franklin Township, Tuscarawas County, north of Strasburg and about north of I-77 exit 87. At the intersection, westbound US 250, which had been heading north–northwest, turns to the west while its roadway continues as SR 21. The route is an undivided, two-lane road.

SR 21 proceeds through Franklin Township. At the line with Bethlehem Township, Stark County, the route crosses SR 212 (Dolphin Street SW) and takes the name Erie Avenue SW. As the route enters Navarre, it takes on the character of a small-town street, taking the name Main Street, then enters a concurrency with US 62 at Canal Street. As the route continues through Navarre, it begins to pick up turn lanes. In northern Navarre, the route becomes three lanes, adding a center left-turn lane. The route next proceeds north into the city of Massillon, becoming a four lane controlled access highway at an interchange with US 30 and takes Interstate 77 Alternate status from it. SR 21 crosses SR 172 (Lincoln Highway) in downtown Massillon and SR 236 (Lake Street) near the northern city limit. The route continues north crossing SR 93 near Canal Fulton.

SR 21 later crosses into both Summit County and Norton. Just after, there is an interchange with SR 585 and Wooster Road that has an unusual configuration. It is a hybrid combination interchange with a left-hand flyover ramp from eastbound SR 585 to northbound SR 21. Eastbound Wooster Road just west of the interchange crosses the ramp from eastbound SR 585 to southbound SR 21 and merges with the loop ramp from southbound SR 21 to eastbound Wooster Road. Additionally, Wooster Road leads to Barberton.

SR 21 merges onto I-77 (exit 136) in Copley Township west of Akron, dropping the assignment of Interstate 77 alternate. It remains in a concurrency with the interstate until reaching exit 145 in Richfield, where it departs the interstate. SR 21 next passes under the Ohio Turnpike. It then passes through Brecksville and into Independence, where it crosses Interstate 480 on an overpass immediately east of I-480&#x27;s interchange with I-77. It next passes briefly through Valley View and into Cuyahoga Heights.

In Cuyahoga Heights, SR 21 reaches its northern terminus at I-77 exit 157.

==History==
SR 21 follows the route of the old U.S. Route 21, a major north–south highway that connected greater Cleveland, Ohio, to southern South Carolina. South of Strasburg, Ohio, near the current southern terminus of SR 21, the designation of US 21 was moved to the new Interstate 77 freeway in east-central and southeastern Ohio by the early 1970s and then decommissioned. North of Strasburg, what remained of US 21 as a route separate from I-77 became SR 21.

While I-77 directly serves the larger cities of Canton, Akron and Cleveland, SR 21 connects the smaller communities of Massillon and Norton (and indirectly Barberton), and serves some Akron and Cleveland suburbs as a local through route.

Very heavily traveled before the Interstate era, much of SR 21 is divided highway or even freeway.

<text>Praslin Island Airport also known as Iles des Palmes Airport, is an airport at Grand Anse on Praslin Island in the Seychelles. It is served by Air Seychelles, which flies scheduled flights to Mahé and charters to the other islands in the Seychelles. The airport has the capacity to handle over 1500 passengers daily and over half a million passengers annually.

==History==
During the late 1990s Praslin underwent an expansion to deal with increased passengers and larger planes. The airport was officially reopened on June 3, 2001. The cost of the renovation was around 40 million Seychellois rupees.

<doc id="716457" wikidata="Q673619" url="?curid=716457" title="Flags and arms of cantons of Switzerland">
<text>Each of the 26 modern cantons of Switzerland has an official flag and a coat of arms.
The history of development of these designs spans the 13th to the 20th centuries.

==List==
The cantons are listed in their order of precedence given in the federal constitution. This reflects the historical order of precedence of the Eight Cantons in the 15th century, followed by the remaining cantons in the order of their historical accession to the confederacy.

&quot;Standesfarben&quot; were used to identify the (historical) cantons when the full banner was not available for display, although there is overlap; Unterwalden and Solothurn share the same colours, as do Basel and Appenzell, and with the accession of the modern cantons, Valais and Basel-City, and St. Gallen and Thurgau.


==Heraldic charges==
Of the 26 cantons since 1999 (22 cantons in 1848, accession of Jura in 1979, three half-cantons designated &quot;canton&quot; in 1999):
*six flags are simple bicolor designs, &quot;per fess&quot; (Lucerne, Fribourg, Solothurn, Ticino), &quot;per bend&quot; (Zürich) or with a central &quot;fess&quot; (Zug). The coats of arms of Ticino and Lucerne have the peculiarity that they are &quot;per pale&quot; even though the flags are &quot;per fess&quot;. 
*eight flags with heraldic animals:
**the bear for Bern and for Appenzell (both Innerrhoden and Ausserrhoden)
**the bull for Uri
**the ram for Schaffhausen
**the ibex for Graubünden (at the time only one of three coats of arms shown side by side for the Three Leagues)
**the eagle () for Geneva
**two lions for Thurgau
*three with the bishop&#x27;s crozier or &quot;Baselstab&quot;, for Basel (Basel-City and Basel-Country) and Jura
*three with a key (Keys of Heaven), for Unterwalden (both Obwalden and Nidwalden) and for Geneva
*two cantons show the Swiss cross, for Schwyz on solid red, and for Neuchâtel in the corner of the &quot;revolutionary&quot; tricolour
*two with stars, Valais and Aargau, the latter with additional wavy lines representing rivers
*two with letters for Appenzell Ausserrhoden (VR for &quot;Ussere Rhoden&quot;) and Vaud (inscription &#x27;Liberté et Patrie&#x27;).
*the image of a pilgrim (Saint Fridolin) for Glarus
*the &quot;fasces&quot; for St. Gallen

Distinctively, Swiss cantons use square flags.

==History==

Historically, the number of cantons was:
* eight from 1352 to 1481, see Eight Cantons
* thirteen from 1513 to 1798, see Thirteen Cantons
* twenty during the time of the Helvetic Republic, from 1798 to 1803, without official flags or coats of arms
* twenty-two from 1848 to 1978, including three cantons divided into two half-cantons each
* twenty-three from 1979 to 1999, due to the secession of the canton of Jura from Bern.

Nidwalden and Obwalden form traditional subdivisions of Unterwalden. Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft, as well as Appenzell Inner- and Ausserrhoden, are half cantons, resulting from the division of Basel and Appenzell, respectively.
The Swiss Federal Constitution of 1999 abandoned the use of the term &quot;half-canton&quot; as an official designation, so that the official number of cantons became 26 - the former half-cantons being now referred to as &quot;cantons with half a cantonal vote&quot; officially, even though they are still commonly referred to as &quot;half-cantons&quot;.

With the exception of Lucerne, Schwyz and Ticino, the cantonal flags are simply transposed versions of the cantonal coats of arms. In case of Lucerne and Ticino, whose flags consist of fields of different colours divided per fess (horizontally), the coats of arms are of the same colours divided per pale (vertically). The coat of arms of Schwyz has the cross moved from the (hoist) canton to the sinister canton with respect to the flag.

The coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons are based on medieval signs, originating as war flags and as emblems used on seals.
For war flags, a distinction was made between &quot;Banner&quot; and &quot;Fähnlein&quot;, the former was the large war flag used only in the case of a full levy of cantonal troops for a major operation. The latter was a smaller flag used for minor military expeditions. The &quot;Banner&quot; was considered a sacred possession, usually kept in a church. Losing the banner to an enemy force was a great shame and invited mockery from other cantons.

Pope Julius II in recognition of the support he received from Swiss mercenaries against France 
in 1512 granted the Swiss the title of &quot;Ecclesiasticae libertatis defensores&quot; and gave them two large banners, besides a blessed sword and hat. Papal legate Matthias Schiner in addition gave to the Swiss cantons and their associates a total of 42 costly silk banners with 
augmentations, the so-called &quot;Juliusbanner&quot;. 
Some of these banners survive, of the cantonal ones notably those of Zürich and Solothurn.

The fashion of arranging cantonal insignia in shields (&quot;escutcheons&quot;) as coats of arms arises in the late 15th century.
The &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; in Baden was presented with stained glass representations of all cantons .
In these designs, two cantonal &quot;escutcheons&quot; were shown side by side, below a shield bearing the Imperial Eagle and a crown, flanked by two banner-bearers.
Based on these, there arose a tradition of representing cantonal arms in stained glass (&quot;Standesscheiben&quot;), alive throughout the early modern period and continued in the modern state.

===Zürich===
The flag of Zürich is derived from a blue-and-white design attested since the 1220s, the diagonal division of the flag is first attested 1389.

The flag of Zürich was adorned by a red Schwenkel since 1273. This was regarded as a mark of sovereignty and honour by the people of Zürich, but the Schwenkel was otherwise used as a mark of &quot;shame&quot;, identifying replacement flags used after a real flag was captured by an enemy
This led to a misunderstanding after the Battle of Nancy, when the Duke of Lorraine removed the Schwenkel from the Zürich flag, stating that with the present victory, Zürich had &quot;erased its shame&quot;. The perplexed Zürich troops later quietly re-attached the Schwenkel.

Zürich attached the Swiss cross in the red Schwenkel rather than in the main flag, and this may have contributed to the development of the flag of Switzerland (placing the white cross in a red field by default).
===Bern===
The city of Bern is a Zähringer foundation of 1160. In the 13th century, its flag showed a black bear in a white field, changed to the current red-and-yellow diagonal arrangement in 1289.
Bern also had a war flag with a simple red-and-black horizontal division. The cantonal colours remain red and black.

===Lucerne===
The blue-and-white flag is attested from 1386.
The vertical division of the coat or arms has been explained as due to a gonfalon type of banner used by Lucerne, hung from a horizontal crossbar, which was also used as a flagstaff, so that the flag was turned by 90 degrees when carried in battle.

===Uri===
The flag originates in the 13th century. It was carried in the battles of Morgarten (1315) and Laupen (1339). One 14th century flag is preserved in the town hall of Altdorf.

===Schwyz===
Schwyz used a solid red war flag (Blutbanner) from 1240.

From the 14th century, a depiction of the crucifixion was sometimes shown on the flag.

Pope Sixtus IV confirmed this addition in 1480, stating explicitly that the crown of thorns and the nails (Arma Christi) should be shown.
The coat of arms remained solid red throughout the 16th to 18th centuries, but from the 17th century in depictions in print (in black and white), the cross was sometimes shown.

The modern design of flag and coat of arms with the cross in one corner dates to 1815. The precise definition of the proportions of the cross dates to 1963.
===Unterwalden===

The flag Unterwalden, as the canton itself, has a complicated history, on one hand due to the rivalry of the constituent half-cantons Obwalden and Nidwalden, and on the other because its historical flag was identical to that of Solothurn.

The war flag of Obwalden was plain red and white, first recorded in 1309.
Nidwalden tended to be dominated by Obwalden and usually fought under the same banner.

A single key was used in the seal of Nidwalden from the mid 13th century.
This seal was used for both Obwalden and Nidwalden (i.e. the united canton of Unterwalden) during the early 14th century. The addition et vallis superioris &quot;and the upper valley&quot; was scratched into the seal to reflect this.
At this point, there was a seal (with the key) and a war flag (red-and-white), but no coat of arms.
From , Obwalden and Nidwalden were separated into two independent territories, while keeping a single vote in the confederate diet. Because of the &quot;and the upper valley&quot; addition scratched into the seal, Nidwalden began using a new seal of its own, and the seal of Unterwalden, formerly the seal of Nidwalden, now was used by Obwalden. The seal of Nidwalden now showed St. Peter with his keys.

Nidwalden began using the double-key as a design on its war flag from the early 15th century.
The red-and-white flag of Unterwalden was now also the flag of Obwalden if both half-cantons were to be represented separately.
This was the situation as the fashion of coats of arms was introduced in the late 15th century.
The early Standesscheiben of the first decade of the 16th century show
the double-key as the coat of arms and flag of Nidwalden, while Obwalden has the red-and-white design in both its flag and its coat of arms.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the coat of arms of the combined canton of Unterwalden came to be depicted as a superposition of the red-and-white flag of Obwalden and the double-key of Nidwalden.

Only in the mid 18th century does the single-key symbol (taken from the 13th-century seal) appear occasionally in coats of arms of Obwalden.
This design was introduced as the official coats of arms of Obwalden in 1816, and the same design came gradually into use also for the flag of Obwalden, which also resolved the problem of the Obwalden flag being identical to that of Solothurn.


===Glarus===
The flag of Glarus ultimately goes back to a banner of Saint Fridolin used in the Battle of Näfels in 1388, because the former banner of Glarus had been captured by the people of Rapperswil in a previous raid.

After this, Glarus used the image of the saint in its banners. During the 15th and 16th century, these images varied considerably. Only by the beginning 17th century a standard design was established, showing the Saint as a pilgrim in silver on a red field.
The modern design shows the pilgrim in black, inspired by a banner shown in Glarus claimed as the original banner of 1388.
The current official design dates to 1959.
===Zug===
First recorded in 1319.

===Fribourg===

The oldest seal of the city dates to 1225 and shows the Zähringer coat of arms.
Fribourg became independent from the Duchy of Savoy in 1477.
The adoption of the black and white banner dates to this period, first recorded in 1478.
In the 17th century, the city coat of arms is shown as quartered, with the city&#x27;s black and white 
in the 1st and 4th quarters, and three towers in white on a blue field in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.
The cantonal colours in the 17th and 18th century, and into the early 19th century, are black and blue, while the coat of arms is shown as white and black. 
In 1830, the canton of Friburg adopts black and white for the cantonal coat of arms and as cantonal colours.

===Solothurn===
1443 (1394?)

===Basel===
The peculiar heraldic shape of the crozier (the &quot;Baselstab&quot; or &quot;Basel staff&quot;) dates to the 13th century, used in the seals of the bishops of Basel.

It was introduced as heraldic emblem in 1385. From this time, the Baselstab in black represented the city, and the same emblem in red represented the bishop.

The staff represented was based on an actual artefact, a gilded staff recorded for the 12th century. 
It is of unknown origin or significance (beyond its obvious status of bishop&#x27;s crozier), but it is assumed to have represented a relic, possibly attributed to Saint Germanus of Granfelden.

The banner of the city of Basel with the same design was introduced in the early 15th century, as the city gained greater independence from the ruling bishops of Basel.

The flag and coat of arms of Basel-Landschaft was introduced in 1834, from the coat of arms of Liestal.
It represents red Baselstab historically used by the bishops, but with the addition of seven crockets (&quot;Krabben&quot;, in local dialect also dubbed &quot;Siebedupf&quot;) and turned to face sinister, representing the secession and &quot;facing away&quot; from the city.

===Schaffhausen===

The flag is documented from 1218. The crown was added to the ram in 1512. The ram was originally rampant with only the rear left hoof on the ground, but in the 1940s this was changed to the salient position with both rear hooves on the ground.

===Appenzell===

The flag is based on that of the Abbot of St. Gallen, who was the feudal lord of Appenzell until 1403. The flag of the abbey showed a bear on a yellow field, and the independent territory Appenzell changed the field to white for its own flag.
Before its independence, Appenzell had a flag of a bear statant (on all fours) on a honeycombed field, attested from 1377.

Appenzell split into its two half-cantons as a result of the Swiss Reformation, in 1597.
The letters V and R in the Ausserrhoden flag stand for &quot;Ussere Rhoden&quot; &quot;outer districts&quot; (V representing /u/).
The oldest representation of the letters is found on a flag, presumably of the 17th century and known to have been in use in 1743.
On this flag, the bear is facing away from the hoist, with the letters V and R on the hoist side, behind the bear&#x27;s back. Above the V is the inscription &quot;SOLI&quot;, corresponding to a lost &quot;DEO GLORIA&quot; on the reverse side. Other military flags with the V and R on either side of the bear are known from the late 18th century.

===St. Gallen===
The coat of arms of the city of St. Gallen like the cantonal coat of arms of Appenzell since the 14th century has shown the bear taken from the flag of the abbot of St. Gall. But the canton of St. Gallen is unrelated to the historical territory of its eponymous capital, having been patched together from eight unrelated territories of other Cantons in 1798.
The cantonal arms and flag are an original design by David von Gonzenbach, created in 1803.
In the original design, the weapon contained in the fasces was a halberd, but this was changed to the axe in 1843. There were a number of other design changes during the 20th century; from the 1930s until 1951, a black Swiss cross was placed on the axe blade to avoid association with the fasces as used as a symbol of Italian fascism.

===Grisons===
The flag of Grisons was adopted in 1933.
From 1815 to 1933, the canton had used various combinations of the three coats of arms of the historical Three Leagues. The modern design combines simplified versions of the historical coats of arms.
A combined coat of arms with the same division of the shield as in the modern version (but with the position of the leagues of God&#x27;s House and of the Ten Jurisdiction reversed) is already found on the &quot;Patenpfenning&quot; minted by Jacob Stampfer in 1547.

===Aargau===
Aargau (Argovia) is the ancient name of the march between Alemannia and Burgundy, but it never was an independent canton historically. Since 1712, the territory of the modern canton had been divided between Zürich and Bern. The canton of Aargau was created as an administrative division of the Helvetic Republic, and its flag is an original design by Samuel Ringier-Seelmatter of Zofingen (1767–1826), dating to 1803.
The current official design, specifying the stars as five-pointed, dates to 1930.

===Thurgau===

Like Aargau, Thurgau (Turgovia) was historically a subject territory of the confederacy, and was created as a canton of the Helvetic Republic.
The flag design is an ad hoc creation of 1803, based on the two lions in the coat of arms of the House of Kyburg which ruled Thurgau in the 13th century.
The green-and-white were regarded as &quot;revolutionary&quot; colours in 1803, also introduced in the coats of arms of St. Gallen and Vaud, but the placement of a yellow lion on white is a violation of heraldic principles, and also creates a visibility problem. There have been suggestions to correct this, including a 1938 suggestion to use a solid green field divided by a diagonal white line, but they were not successful.

===Ticino===
The flag is an 1803 design, but its designer or intended symbolism have not been recorded.
The convention of displaying the flag &quot;per fess&quot; is apparently inspired by Lucerne.

===Vaud===
The design dates to 1803, based on the flag used in the Vaudois insurrection against Bernese rule in the 1790s, which was green and inscribed with Liberté, Egalité in white lettering. From this, the white and green became the &quot;revolutionary&quot; colours of cantons newly created from former subject territories of the confederacy, also used in the flags of the cantons of St. Gallen and Thurgau, and a green flag was also briefly used by Aargau.
The lettering in the Vaudois flag was in black or in green during 1803–1819, the gold was introduced with the military flag as Vaud organised its army in 1819. As such, it violates the heraldic rule of tincture which states that gold (or yellow) may not be placed upon silver (or white).

===Valais===

The Bishop of Sion used a vertically divided red-and-white war flag from . The coat of arms of Valais originates in 1613, as the subject territories of the bishop were united into a republic, the stars representing the individual Dixains. There were six stars in 1613, augmented to seven in 1628. In the 1803 Act of Mediation, Napoleon separated the Valais from the restored Swiss Confederacy, and in 1810 he annexed it into the Department of Simplon. At this point the number of Dixains and the number of stars in the flag was increased to twelve. The thirteenth star was added as the Valais joined the restored Swiss Confederacy in 1815, with the creation of Conthey as the thirteenth Dixain.

===Neuchâtel===

The flag is unrelated to the historical flag of the town of Neuchâtel, which had been in use from 1350, and as cantonal flag from 1815 until 1848, and which remains part of the town&#x27;s coat of arms.
The canton of Neuchâtel was admitted to the restored Swiss Confederacy in 1815, but with the peculiar reservation that it owed nominal fealty to the king of Prussia. This lingering monarchism led to a republican coup in 1848, under the flag that would later become the cantonal flag.
The conflict between monarchists by 1856 threatened to devolve into full civil war, but in 1857, Frederick William IV of Prussia renounced all claims to Neuchâtel, and the 1848 revolutionary banner was made the official cantonal flag.
Use of the flag remained disputed, and during the 20th century there were three unsuccessful attempts to reintroduce the historical flag of 1350 by popular vote.

===Geneva===
The flag of Geneva is the historical flag of the city of Geneva, showing the Imperial Eagle and a Key of St. Peter (symbolizing the status of Geneva as &quot;Reichsstadt&quot; and as episcopal seat, respectively), in use since the 15th century.
The flag of the medieval bishopric of Geneva showed two golden Keys of Peter in the red field of the imperial &quot;Blutbanner&quot; since 1293.

The full heraldic achievement of Geneva includes a crest in the form of half a sun inscribed with JHS (for &quot;Jesus Hominum Salvator&quot;), and a scroll below the shield with the motto &quot;Post Tenebras Lux&quot;.

The coat of arms of the city of Geneva was adopted as the cantonal coat of arms upon the accession of Geneva as a city-canton to the restored Swiss Confederacy in 1815.

===Jura===

The separatist movement which eventually led to the canton&#x27;s creation emerged in the 1940s, and the flag is a design by Paul Boesch, dated to 1943. The crozier symbolizes the former Prince-Bishopric of Basel, the seven stripes represent the seven districts of the Bernese Jura.
It was officially recognized as a regional flag by Bern from the early 1950s.
The canton of Jura was created in 1979 after a referendum, but only three of the seven districts opted to join. The seven stripes were retained in the cantonal flag regardless, and there remains some irredentism calling for a restored unity of all seven districts.

<doc id="716458" wikidata="Q914936" url="?curid=716458" title="Coil stamp">
<text>A coil stamp is a type of postage stamp sold in strips one stamp wide. The name derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a manner reminiscent of adhesive tape rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps are sold in coil form, because they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large quantities than either sheet stamps or booklet stamps.

==Origins==
Coil stamps first appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.

==In Sweden==
While in most countries coil production is restricted to the workaday stamps used in large quantities, Sweden has produced coil versions of most of their stamps since 1920.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the UK, coil stamps first appeared in 1907, to supply newly installed stamp vending machines. As these were cut from complete sheets, they are perforated on all four sides. As each stamp was worth either a half or one old penny and 240 pence made up one pound sterling, the coils were in rolls of 960 or 480 each.

==In the United States==
In the United States, vending machine companies began to experiment with the automated dispensing of stamps. Early efforts to break sheets into strips manually did not work well, since they were prone to tearing and jamming, and soon the companies began to request imperforate sheets from the post office, cutting those into strips and punching holes of various shapes between each stamp. A variety of these &quot;private coils&quot; is known, some quite rare.

The first US government-produced coils appeared in 1908, produced by pasting together enough imperforate sheets to make rolls of 500 or 1,000 stamps, cutting them into strips and perforating between. The 1-cent, 2-cent and 5-cent values in the Series of 1902 (Second Bureau Issue) were produced in coil versions, but relatively few copies exist because in late 1908 the series was superseded by the Washington-Franklin Issues. As a result, all Second Bureau coils are quite rare. Even the most common, the horizontal 2-cent coil, can fetch as much as US$2000, while the much rarer, the 1-cent vertical coil, brought $130,000 at an auction in 2009, and the even rarer 2-cent vertical coil (only eight copies are known) would surely sell for considerably more, should one become available.

Later a rotary press was adopted, which eliminated the pasting stage. The cylindrical plate used on a rotary press has a seam where ink tends to accumulate, resulting in joint line pairs.

==Perforations==
The perforations of coil stamps are usually found along the right and left sides (&quot;vertical perf&quot;), but they have also been produced with perforations along the top and bottom (&quot;horizontal perf&quot;). Longer perforations on one side than the other, and separation by cutting rather than tearing, are indications that a stamp may have come from a coil.

==Recent innovations==
A recent innovation enabled by self-adhesive technology is the linerless coil stamp. While most self-adhesive stamps have backing paper, linerless coils are like a roll of adhesive tape. Such rolls tend to be enormous, with thousands of stamps, and tend to be used only by large mailing operations.

<doc id="716464" wikidata="Q4356803" url="?curid=716464" title="Hurricane Danielle (1998)">
<text>Hurricane Danielle was a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane in late August and early September 1998. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Danielle originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the disturbance was initially disorganized; under favorable atmospheric conditions, shower and thunderstorm activity began to consolidate around a low-pressure center. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four during the pre-dawn hours of August 24, and further to Tropical Storm Danielle that afternoon. Moving around the southern periphery of the Azores High located in the northeastern Atlantic, quick intensification to hurricane status occurred early on August 25. By 0600 UTC the following day, Danielle reached an initial peak intensity of , a Category 2 hurricane. Increased wind shear from a nearby trough encroached on further development later that day, and subsequently led to slight weakening. By 1200 UTC on August 27, despite continued unfavorable conditions, Danielle reached a second peak intensity equal to the first. Weakening once ensued late on August 27 in addition to the days following, and Danielle was a low-end Category 1 hurricane by August 31 as its forward speed slowed.

As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the ridge that steered it across the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category 1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a baroclinic zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000 UTC on September 4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle&#x27;s transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged with the system resulted in large waves off the coast of the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported with the system and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage.

==Meteorological history==
The origins of Hurricane Danielle trace back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean early on August 21. Tracking west-northwestward, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began Dvorak satellite intensity estimates later that morning following the consolidation of convection – shower and thunderstorm activity – near the system&#x27;s center. Favorable atmospheric conditions led to further organization, and it is estimated that the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression by 0600 UTC on August 24, while located roughly west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 1530 UTC and noted that the depression was already on the verge of tropical storm intensity. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle later on August 24 following an increase in organization on satellite imagery.

As the cyclone moved northwestward along the southern periphery of the Azores High, it began a period of rapid deepening in which a &quot;pinhole&quot; eye became distinguishable on satellite imagery; on this basis, Danielle was upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 UTC on August 25. At the time, Danielle was a compact system, with tropical storm force winds spanning only from the center. Although the NHC was fairly certain that the storm would continue west-northwestward, a veer north or south of the forecast track seemed plausible due to the influence of an upper-level low to the west-northwest of Danielle. Nonetheless, the storm continued its west-northwest track. At 0600 UTC on August 26, Danielle attained its maximum sustained wind speed of , one of four peak intensities. Although the eye became obscured and southeasterly vertical wind shear increased late on August 26, the National Hurricane Center did not indicate weakening and instead predicted that Danielle would reach winds of by late on August 27. Early on August 27, a United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight reported surface winds of , though post-analysis indicates that the intensity of the storm was underestimated.

The storm briefly re-strengthened slightly on August 27, reaching its maximum sustained wind speed of for the second time at 1200 UTC. Vertical wind shear persisted and Danielle soon began to weaken again. Later on August 27, the National Hurricane Center predicted that the storm would travel along the periphery of an anticyclone centered just east of Bermuda, which would keep the storm away from the East Coast of the United States. Despite being in an apparently favorable environment, Danielle continued to slowly weaken, as the forecast for decreasing wind shear did not initially materialize. Additionally, upwelling from Hurricane Bonnie roughly a week earlier contributed to a decrease in strength. Although the storm weakened further, reconnaissance aircraft observations on August 29 concluded that the structure of Danielle had improved compared to the previous day. By early on August 30, Danielle had weakened to the extent that it was only a minimal hurricane, with maximum winds of at the time. On August 30, the National Hurricane Center noted that Danielle would soon leave the upwelling track left by Bonnie, and likely lead to intensification. Thus, the possibility of re-strengthening increased, though predictions only showed gradual intensification. 

By early on August 31, an increase in sustained winds, a decrease in barometric pressure, and a wide eye observed by reconnaissance aircraft all suggested that Danielle was beginning to intensify. On August 31, the anticyclone near Bermuda caused Danielle to curve northeastward, away from the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, a significant increase in intensity led the storm to again reach its maximum sustained wind speed of . On September 1, there was significant uncertainty in the future intensity of Danielle, as a shortwave trough located northeast of the storm would either enhance outflow, causing strengthening, or increase wind shear, resulting in weakening. At 1500 UTC on September 1, it was predicted that Danielle would strengthen slightly before weakening and becoming extratropical by September 3. Three hours later, Danielle reached its maximum sustained wind speed of for the fourth and final time.

Early on September 2, the storm weakened again and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. At 0600 UTC on September 3, Danielle reached its minimum barometric pressure of , although sustained winds were only at the time. As late as 1500 UTC on September 3, satellite imagery indicated that Danielle was retaining tropical characteristics. The National Hurricane Center did not forecast any further weakening before the extratropical transition, but instead mentioned the possibility of baroclinic strengthening. Late on September 3, the final advisory was issued on the transitioning storm. Danielle officially transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on September 4 according to a post-season report from the NHC, while located east-southeast of Newfoundland. The remnants of Danielle traversed east and eventually northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean. It produced rough seas in the British Isles on September 6 before merging with an extratropical low pressure area north of Ireland on September 8.

==Preparations and impact==
Shortly after formation, Danielle was considered a potential threat to the Lesser Antilles, with the National Hurricane Center noting that &quot;any deviation to the left of the track would bring Danielle closer [to] the Leeward Islands.&quot; However, Danielle bypassed far enough north of the Lesser Antilles to prevent any tropical storm or hurricane watches or warnings. Several days later, the storm was considered a possible threat to Florida by local newspapers, though the National Hurricane Center accurately predicted a re-curvature from the United States mainland well in advance. At 1500 UTC on September 1, at which time Danielle was situated northeast of the Bahamas, a tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda; this was later cancelled after Danielle passed northwest of the island.

The outer bands of Danielle produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing street flooding and landslides in Bayamón, Guaynabo, Toa Alta, and Vega Alta; several streams overflowed their banks, causing additional flooding. In a neighborhood of Bayamón, one house was damaged after a wall collapsed. Losses in Puerto Rico totaled to approximately $50,000 (1998 USD). Hurricane Bonnie ripped an artificial reef composed of tires offshore Atlantic Beach, North Carolina in late August. Danielle washed numerous of these loose tires ashore, especially on Emerald Isle. As a result, the Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt, requested prison labor and the National Guard to clean up beaches from Brunswick County to Carteret County. Instead of resulting in further erosion in the aftermath of Bonnie farther up along the coast, Danielle led to a increase in sand along the New Jersey coastline. In Bermuda, sustained winds of and a gust of were reported on September 2. Offshore Atlantic Canada, wave heights reached as high as . However, other than light rainfall in Newfoundland, the storm caused no impact in Canada. Tori Murden, an American attempting to become the first woman to solo row across the Atlantic Ocean, encountered rough seas from the storm and its remnants. By September 7, Murden sent out a distress signal and was rescued by the &quot;Independent Spirit&quot; later that day.

While passing near the British Isles on September 6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle produced severe sea conditions on the western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an all-terrain police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‑year-old boy and his father were trapped in a sea cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht carrying eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the town of Melksham. Numerous motorists were left stranded in inundated streets, while water entered several homes, store basements, a fire station, and the Cooper Avon tyre factory.

<doc id="716471" wikidata="Q938597" url="?curid=716471" title="Marbles (album)">
<text>Marbles is the 13th studio album from rock band Marillion, released in 2004. Unlike their previous studio album, &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; (2001), which was financed largely by a preorder campaign, the band funded the recording, and it was the publicity campaign that fans financed for the album. Those fans who pre-ordered the album received an exclusive 2-CD &quot;Deluxe Campaign Edition&quot; with a booklet containing the names of everyone who pre-ordered before a certain date. The public release date of the retail single-CD version of the album was 3 May 2004 while a plain 2-CD version was made available from the band&#x27;s website. A limited (500 copy) edition was released on white multicoloured vinyl by Racket Records on 13 November 2006.

In 2011, the 2-CD version became available as a retail edition in a mediabook by the Madfish label, reissued in 2017 as a simpler digipak edition. Madfish also released the full album on vinyl for the first time, occupying three LPs. Another reissue of the CD appeared in 2021 on Kscope.

The album did not chart in the UK, due to it being packaged with a couple of stickers, which is against chart rules. So despite selling enough for a top 30 position, the album was declared ineligible for the album chart; however, its first single &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart, thus becoming their first UK top ten hit since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Incommunicado&quot;. The follow-up single &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt Yourself&quot; peaked at #16. Classic Rock ranked &quot;Marbles&quot; #11 on their end-of-year list for 2004. The album is ranked at #53 on &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time. 

== Concept and reception ==
&quot;Marbles&quot; was the second Marillion album in a row produced by Dave Meegan, who had already helped the band craft &quot;Brave&quot; and &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;, albums to which &quot;Marbles&quot; was compared by both reviewers as well as the band itself. Unlike &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; though, &quot;Marbles&quot; was mostly not mixed by Meegan but Mike Hunter. Exceptions are &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Place&quot;, &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot; (mixed by Meegan), &quot;Genie&quot; (mixed by Steven Wilson) and &quot;Angelina&quot; (mixed by Meegan and Wilson).

While &quot;Marbles&quot; is not strictly a concept album, it is tied together by thematic threads. Several of the songs are connected via segues or crossfades. The four parts of the title track work as musical interludes, but they also tell a continuing story about the narrator&#x27;s childhood fascination with marbles, collecting them and losing most of them over the years. (&quot;Losing one&#x27;s marbles&quot; is slang term for going insane, which has also been described as a theme of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.) Furthermore, the song &quot;The Damage&quot; includes multiple lyrical call-backs to &quot;Genie&quot;; &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot; mentions &quot;the invisible man&quot; and in a key moment of &quot;Neverland&quot;, the line &quot;you&#x27;re gone&quot; appears.

According to Steve Hogarth, escape is a recurring theme on the album.

&quot;Ocean Cloud&quot; is inspired by and dedicated to Don Allum and the Ocean Rowers, even including a link to Allum&#x27;s at-sea diary and actual samples of him talking about the experience.

<text>U.S. Route 21 or U.S. Highway 21 (US 21) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway, spanning from Hunting Island State Park, South Carolina, to Wytheville, Virginia. The route traverses three states, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It connects southeastern cities, including Columbia, South Carolina, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

US 21 starts at Hunting Island State Park, bypasses Beaufort, South Carolina, and then heads north across the low country, paralleling Interstate 77 (I-77) through urban and rural areas before entering North Carolina. In North Carolina, US 21 frequently merges with and splits from I-77. The route enters Virginia, passing through hilly terrain before ending at the intersection of Interstate 81 (I-81) / U.S. Route 52 (US 52) in Wytheville.

Despite the &quot;1&quot; indicating that it is a major north–south highway, US 21 only travels through three states and is no longer a cross-country route, as many sections have been replaced by I-77 in Ohio and West Virginia. Historically, US 21 was longer before the Interstate Highway System was established. US 21 originally ran from Cleveland, Ohio, to Yemassee, South Carolina, it was later extended to Beaufort and Hunting Island State Park. Over time, its length was reduced, making it the second-shortest major north–south route after U.S. Route 91 (US 91). 

US 21 serves as an alternative to the more heavily trafficked interstates in the area, particularly I-77, I-26, and Interstate 95 (I-95).

US 21 travels through the state. Beginning at Hunting Island State Park, US 21 travels west toward Beaufort, where it widens to four lanes. The route bypasses Beaufort to the south, going through Port Royal, Shell Point, and Burton. In the Beaufort area, US 21 passes by the entrances to Parris Island and Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, the major Marine Corps installations in the area. North of Beaufort, US 21 continues as a four-lane divided highway and intersects with US 17. The route travels in a wrong-way concurrency with US 17 south for before turning north toward Yemassee, where it becomes a rural two-lane road and intersects with US 17 Alternate. North of Yemassee, US 21 splits off and crosses I-95 at exit 42.

The two-lane route continues through rural portions of the state. US 21 goes through Smoaks and Branchville and bypasses Orangeburg. North of Orangeburg, US 21 runs roughly parallel to I-26 until Gaston where it conjoins US 321 and becomes an urban highway. US 21 passes through Cayce, West Columbia, and Columbia.

North of Columbia, US 21 splits from US 321, reverting to a rural two-lane road parallel to I-77. In York County, US 21 enters urban areas again, connecting Rock Hill and Fort Mill. Near the North Carolina state line, US 21 merges with I-77 near Carowinds, then enters North Carolina.

===North Carolina===

US 21 begins as a concurrency with I-77 in Charlotte, which it repeats three times within the state. Its first break with I-77 is along Statesville Avenue, then proceeding through Huntersville and Cornelius, however, because of its close proximity to I-77 and North Carolina Highway 115 (NC 115), it has no interchange with I-485 by itself. The second break with I-77 occurs at Mooresville, where US 21 travels through the city and then northwest into Statesville. After Statesville, US 21 travels northeast to Harmony and Brooks Crossroads, before merging back with I-77 near Jonesville. However, Jonesville and Elkin connect with US 21 Bus. through centers of both towns, as an alternate route paralleling I-77. North of Elkin, US 21 splits with I-77 for the last time and goes north to Sparta, passing the Blue Ridge Parkway after a major, curvy section. North of Sparta, at Twin Oaks, US 221 overlaps with US 21 before entering Virginia. US 21 travels through the western Piedmont of North Carolina, either combined with I-77 or as a two-lane rural road; from the South Carolina state line to Elkin, travelers can easily skip a majority of US 21 via I-77.

===Virginia===

After a few miles crossing the state line, US 21 reaches the town of Independence, where it splits with US 221 and continues north. The route goes through the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area before entering the city of Wytheville. After a short concurrency with US 11 in downtown Wytheville, it goes north and ends at the intersection of I-81/US 52. US 21 travels through western Virginia, mostly as a two-lane rural mountain road.

==History==

US 21 in the pre-Interstate era was a north–south highway connecting the area around Lake Erie and the coastal South. One of the few true north–south routes to cross the middle Appalachian Mountains, it became an important corridor for motor traffic between northeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, (with US 19) and western New York with central North Carolina, central and southeastern South Carolina, and (by connecting with other highways) coastal Georgia and most of Florida. Many referred to the stretch of US 21 from the Great Lakes Region to Florida as &quot;The Lakes-to-Florida Highway&quot;.

US 21 originally (in 1926) connected Cleveland, Ohio, and Yemassee, South Carolina. In 1935 it was extended to Beaufort, South Carolina, and again in 1953 to its current southern terminus at the Atlantic Coast at Hunting Island State Park, between the city of Beaufort and Fripp Island.

In the Interstate Highway era, much of US 21 became an obvious corridor for a long-distance expressway. The West Virginia Turnpike between Charleston, West Virginia, and Princeton, West Virginia, was the first segment of a planned series of toll highways along or near US 21 from Cleveland to Charlotte, North Carolina. All the other toll highways were shelved in favor of freeways built with Interstate funding; these freeways and the West Virginia Turnpike became I-77, which completely supplanted old US 21 as a long-distance through route. I-77 was later extended to Columbia, South Carolina, also within a few miles of US 21.

Between Cleveland and Charleston, all but a relatively short segment of US 21 was completely deleted in favor of I-77, the relics being as follows:

* State Route 21 (SR 21) between Cuyahoga Heights and Strasburg;
* SR 821 between I-77 near Byesville and SR 60 near Marietta, Ohio;
* County Road 35 (CR 35, Oakwood Road, Byesville Road, Old Twenty-One Road) between Byesville and the Guernsey–Tuscarawas county line;
* CR 3 (Salt Fork Road) between the Guernsey–Tuscarawas county line to SR 258
* CR 21 between Newcomerstown and New Philadelphia
* County Route 21 (CR 21) between Mineral Wells and Charleston.
Between Charleston and its current northern terminus at Wytheville, Virginia, almost all of US 21 ran concurrently with either US 60, US 19, or US 52, which remained as US 21 was deleted. The short segment of US 21 in southern West Virginia not coinciding with another U.S. Highway became an extension of West Virginia Route 16.

In North Carolina, US 21 originally entered the state along today&#x27;s NC 51 into Pineville, then followed Old Pineville Road into Charlotte. In the mid-1930s, US 21 moved over to South Boulevard from Old Pineville Road. In 1969, US 21 was rerouted following today&#x27;s I-77 alignment, the old route was replaced by an extension of US 521. From 1975–1987, US 21 moved north in segments onto I-77 to its current alignment ending at exit 16A (Sunset Road). Further north, US 21 originally followed Old Statesville Road, replaced in 1956 by NC 115. In 1966, US 21 was bypassed around Jonesville and Elkin, replaced with US 21 Bus.

US 21 in Beaufort, South Carolina, was rerouted around the city over former SC 280 as well as a portion of SC 802. The new routing went into effect on February 26, 2012.

<text>Monstera deliciosa, the Swiss cheese plant or split-leaf philodendron is a species of flowering plant native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama. It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. It is very widely grown in temperate zones as a houseplant.

The common name &quot;Swiss cheese plant&quot; is also used for the related species from the same genus, &quot;Monstera adansonii&quot;. The common name &quot;split-leaf philodendron&quot; is also used for the species &quot;Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum&quot;, although neither species is in the genus &quot;Philodendron&quot;.

==Names==
The specific epithet &quot;deliciosa&quot; means &quot;delicious&quot;, referring to the edible fruit. The genus &quot;Monstera&quot; is named from the Latin word for &quot;monstrous&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;, and refers to the unusual leaves with natural holes that members of the genus have.

Its popular name as a houseplant of &quot;Swiss cheese plant&quot;, or just &quot;cheese plant&quot;, is commonly stated to refer to the &quot;eyes&quot; or holes that develop in its leaves similar to the holes in some Swiss-type cheeses such as Emmental cheese.

Other common names include delicious monster, fruit salad plant, fruit salad tree (in reference to its edible fruit, which tastes similar to a fruit salad), ceriman (Trinidad), ojal (Venezuela), hojadillo (Colombia), monster fruit, monsterio delicio, monstereo, Mexican breadfruit, windowleaf, balazo and Penglai banana. The names in Spanish (), Portuguese (), and French () refer to the change of the leaves from entire to , comparing it in the first two cases with the ribs of Adam and in the third with the hole-filled gruyère cheese. In Mexico, the plant is sometimes referred to as . In coastal regions of Sicily, especially Palermo, it is called &quot;zampa di leone&quot; (lion&#x27;s paw).

==Description==

This member of the arum family (Araceae) is a hemiepiphyte with aerial roots. It is able to grow up to high in the wild, with large, leathery, glossy, pinnate, heart-shaped leaves long by broad. The leaves on young plants are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and fenestrate leaves as they grow. Although it can grow very tall in nature, it only measures between when grown indoors. The older the plant, the more the leaves are covered with its familiar large perforations.

Wild seedlings grow towards the darkest area they can grow until they find a tree trunk, then start to grow up towards the light, creeping up the tree.

The inflorescence is adorned with a cream-white spathe of uniform, velvety appearance, covering, like a hood, a yellowish white spadix high and about in diameter. Flowers are self pollinating, containing both androecium and gynoecium. Since they contain both structures, this plant is able to self-pollinate.

===Fruit===

The fruit of &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; is up to long and diameter, and it looks like a green ear of maize covered with hexagonal scales. As the fruit ripens, these scales or platelets fall off the fruit, releasing a strong and sweet scent. The smell has been compared to a combination of pineapples and bananas. The fruit is edible and safe for humans.

Fruits of plants of the Araceae (Arum family) often contain raphides and trichosclereids – needle-like structures of calcium oxalate. In &quot;M. deliciosa,&quot; unripe fruit containing these needle-like crystalline structures can cause irritation of the mouth.

It takes longer than a year for fruits to reach maturity. The fruit first shows signs of ripening by the yellowing of its lowest scales. As it ripens, the starch that was stored in the green fruit is converted to sugar, giving it its sweet flavor. This mechanism is comparable to how banana fruits ripen. The strong odor the fruit produces becomes noticeable when it is half-ripe. As time passes and the fruit continues to ripen, the odor becomes stronger. After it becomes fully ripe, however, the scent deteriorates quickly.

==Distribution and growth==
This plant lives in the humid tropical forests, in the lowlands and middle mountains, in the extreme south of Mexico and also in Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Cuba, and Panama. The seeds fall to the ground, then the seedlings crawl (negative phototropism) until they meet a tree on which to attach. The many adjacent roots thus allow the plant to anchor against its new support and reach the canopy light (although it rarely grows in full sun and prefers a light dimmed by the foliage). Wild plants can also be found in other parts of North America (Florida), Asia (Malaysia, India), Australia and the Western Mediterranean and Atlantic (Sicily, Mainland Portugal, Morocco, Madeira).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; is commonly grown outdoors as an ornamental plant in the tropics and subtropics. The plant requires a lot of space and a rich and loose soil (ideally garden soil and compost in equal parts). If it grows in the ground it is better to plant it near a tree, where it can climb, if not against a trellis. It is a &quot;moderately greedy plant,&quot; in that it needs to be watered just to keep the soil slightly moist. Its hardiness is 11 (that is to say the coldest at ). It cannot withstand these temperatures for more than a few hours, but it can live outside in certain temperate regions (Mediterranean coast, Brittany). A steady minimum temperature of at least is preferable, allowing continuous growth. Growth ceases below and it is killed by frost. It needs very bright exposure, but not full sun.

Forcing a &quot;M. deliciosa&quot; to flower outside of its typical tropical habitat proves to be difficult. Specific conditions need to be met for the plant to flower. However, in its tropical and subtropical habitat, the plant flowers easily. In ideal conditions it flowers about three years after planting. The plant can be propagated by taking cuttings of a mature plant or by air layering.

===Harvesting the fruit===
In those areas where it grows naturally, &quot;M. deliciosa&quot; is considered a delicacy due to its sweet and exotic flavor. The fruit may be ripened by cutting it when the first scales begin to lift up and it begins to exude a pungent odor. It is wrapped in a paper bag and set aside until the scales begin popping off. The scales are then brushed off or fall away to reveal the edible flesh underneath. The flesh, which is similar to pineapple in texture, can be cut away from the core and eaten. It has a fruity taste similar to jackfruit and pineapple. The unripe green fruits can irritate the throat and the latex of the leaves and vines can create rashes in the skin, because both contain potassium oxalate: that is the reason why the fruits have to be consumed when the scales lift up. The black irritant fibers can be swept off with the application of a little citrus juice.

===Indoor cultivation===
Its architectural qualities, ease of cultivation, and tolerance of a wide range of conditions make it an ideal plant for indoor cultivation as well. For this reason it is a popular plant for the home or office throughout the temperate northern hemisphere. It prefers bright indirect light and temperatures of . It is usually watered when the soil has slightly dried out (after around one or two weeks). It requires good drainage to thrive. Flowering is rare when grown indoors.

In the UK &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; and the cultivar &#x27;Variegata&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Other uses==
The aerial roots have been used as ropes in Peru, and to make baskets in Mexico. In Martinique, the root is used to make a traditional medicine for snakebites. In Mexico, it is used as traditional medicine for the relief of arthritis symptoms.

==Toxicity==
&quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot; is moderately toxic to both cats and dogs because it contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (needle-like). This crystal may cause injury to the mouth, tongue, and digestive tract. It also causes dermatitis by direct contact with cat and dog skin.

<text>DTN, previously known as Telvent DTN, Data Transmission Network and Dataline, is a private company based in Bloomington, Minnesota that specializes in subscription-based services for the analysis and delivery of real-time weather, agricultural, energy, and commodity market information. As of 2018 the company has approximately 600,000 subscribers, mostly in the United States. DTN is known for its accurate meteorological forecasting and large network of weather stations, its market analysis services, and its early use of radio and satellite systems to transmit reports to its Midwestern consumers. DTN also operates &quot;The Progressive Farmer&quot; magazine. DTN was previously owned by Telvent and Schneider Electric, and since 2017 has been owned by Zürich-based TBG.

==History==

===Formation (1984–1987)===
In the early 1980s the Omaha-based company Scoular Grain was a growing agribusiness led by Nebraska grain industry executive Marshall Faith. Faith, along with several other investors, had acquired what was then Scoular-Bishop Grain Company in 1967 and expanded its operations from three grain elevators to dozens of locations in multiple states, and was beginning to branch out beyond grain warehousing. On 9 April 1984 the company created a new subsidiary incorporated under the name Scoular Information Services with the goal of improving communications with farmers. The project was led by Omaha native Roger Brodersen, Scoular&#x27;s chief operating officer and the executive who supervised new-project development and corporate acquisitions for the company. The subsidiary soon became known as Dataline.

Dataline&#x27;s chief product was an FM radio receiver unit that would pick up Dataline broadcasts transmitted via sideband signals. Farmers and agribusinesses would buy the receivers to get agricultural information and commodities updates. Dataline&#x27;s customers preferred to lease the receivers rather than buy them, but Scoular was unwilling to finance the equipment, so Brodersen bought Dataline in 1986 and a year later took its stock public in order to raise the capital necessary to acquire the receivers and to develop other information products. Under the new model, subscribers would receive a radio signal receiver and a video terminal at no charge, and then pay a monthly subscription to receive 24-hour-a-day broadcasts of 20+ pages of market information, weather reports, and analysis. In late 1986, the monthly fees were $17.50 and the service was available in Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois. Public broadcasting station WILL-TV in Champaign was one broadcaster that carried the Dataline signal.

At the beginning of 1987 Dataline had 5,300 subscribers; that grew to 10,000 by May and 13,500 in ten states by October. In addition to being accessible on terrestrial FM carriers, Dataline was also broadcast from the Galaxy 1 communications satellite. Monthly fees were $19.50 for 65 videotext pages of market quotes, grain and livestock information, commentary, weather, and reports. In September, Dataline partnered with a subsidiary of ConAgra to add an &quot;electronic catalog&quot; feature to their information feed, allowing subscribers to browse farm supplies, equipment, and other products.

On 17 September 1987 the company re-incorporated and was renamed Data Transmission Network.

===Expansion (1988–1997)===
The company, commonly identified simply as DTN, expanded rapidly through the late 1980s and early 1990s; its operating cash flow grew roughly 30% each year beginning in 1989 and by 1993 was $12.9M. By mid-1994 DTN had roughly 77,000 subscribers, about 60,000 of which were in the agricultural sector; the remainder were mostly in the finance and energy industries. Subscriptions in 1994 were $26 a month; satellite connection was an extra $7/month and a color monitor an extra $20/month. By 1997 it had 152,000 customers, 110,000 of which were in agriculture.

Beginning in the mid-1990s DTN also grew its operations by acquiring other data and meteorology companies. In May 1996 it acquired its chief competitor FarmDayta (formerly Broadcast Partners) of Urbandale, Iowa for $73M, and adopted its 38,500 subscribers. In 1998 DTN merged its weather services division with Minneapolis-based Kavouras, a company founded in 1977 that specialized in radar-based weather reporting and prediction; DTN also acquired Weather Services Corporation (WSC), a Lexington, Massachusetts-based forecasting and climate prediction company that developed meteorological databases. The union of the three weather organizations became known as DTN/Meteorlogix.

The company also worked in the &#x27;90s to expand into niche markets by offering more specialized service offerings.

===Sale and bankruptcy (1998–2003)===
In the late 1990s, DTN entered a period of financial uncertainty, in part due to increasing competition with new free information channels like CNBC, the Weather Channel, and websites run by &quot;Farm Journal&quot; and Pioneer. In response, DTN sought to expand its customer base by selling a broader array of services, including inventory-tracking for auto dealers, coupon-printing kiosks for grocery stores, fire-alert information for forestry services, and other ventures. DTN gained 7,600 new subscribers but lost 4,500 from its core group of agricultural customers, and its stock fell 38% in 1999.

Since April 1998, DTN had been seeking an organization to buy the 1300-employee company, but after 11 months had not found anyone willing to pay a price that the board felt was appropriate, so in mid-March 1999 founder Roger Brodersen called off the search for a buyer. One week later on 24 March, Brodersen and four other directors resigned and Peter Kamin was named the new chairman. Kamin, the leader of a stockholders group that pressed to sell the company, resumed the search for a buyer.

In April 2000, the New York City-based private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson agreed to buy out DTN for $451M, including $91M in debt. DTN at the time had approximately 166,000 clients. Veronis implemented a new strategy by splitting DTN into four separate divisions: agriculture, energy, weather, and financial services. Robert Gordon, who would later become DTN CEO, was hired to run the weather division.

Staffing up the four divisions proved slow and costly, and by 2003 sales were lower than in 1998. DTN entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2003 and its operation was taken over by a consortium of banks led by Wachovia, DTN&#x27;s lead creditor. DTN emerged from bankruptcy six weeks later.

===Revival (2004–2007)===
Robert Gordon became president in January and CEO in July 2004. He gradually reduced staff to 675, eliminated redundancies, and pushed a new strategy of selling proprietary data at a premium price. Customers paid larger subscription fees ($100 a month for many weather customers) to receive customized, hourly webcasts based on more precise computer models; ag customers paid roughly 50% more for analyses of issues like Asian soybean rust and avian influenza; and energy customers gained access to online exchanges with real-time fuel prices.

Gordon&#x27;s strategy proved successful and DTN began to re-expand. In July 2006 DTN acquired St. Louis-based Surface Systems, Inc. (SSI), a company specializing in weather monitors for roads and airport runways, and integrated its customers and its network of 6000 surface sensors into its Meteorlogix division. In 2007 it acquired the majority of the Edmond, Oklahoma company WeatherBank, integrating its energy, transportation, public safety, and agriculture weather forecasting customers into Meteorlogix.

In 2007, DTN also arranged with publisher Time Warner to acquire &quot;The Progressive Farmer&quot;, an agricultural magazine founded in 1886 and read at the time of acquisition by approximately 600,000 subscribers. The deal for an undisclosed sum supported Time Warner&#x27;s strategy of shedding smaller publications to focus on its larger magazine properties and DTN&#x27;s mission of providing agricultural information.

DTN remained structured around four brands: DTN Ag, DTN Energy, DTN Market Access, and DTN Meteorlogix.

===Telvent and Schneider (2008–2016)===
On 28 October 2008, Madrid-based IT company Telvent acquired DTN in a $445M all-cash deal. DTN at the time of the acquisition had about 700 employees, 700,000 subscribers, and annual revenues of approximately $180M, with about 90% of its sales derived from its subscription-based services. After its acquisition the company became known as Telvent DTN.

Telvent itself was purchased in 2011 by Schneider Electric, a large energy management company based in Rueil-Malmaison, France. Schneider announced in early 2011 that it had reached a deal to acquire Telvent, and in August received regulatory approval to complete the €1.4B acquisition.
 Telvent DTN&#x27;s revenue at the time of the acquisition was approximately $213 million.

In June 2014 DTN acquired RevCo, a St. Louis-based agricultural data management business.

===TBG and recent growth (2017–)===

In 2016 Schneider put DTN up for sale after a strategic review found that it wasn&#x27;t essential to the company. Several firms were interested in purchasing DTN (including London-based Euromoney Institutional Investor), but it was Zürich-based private investment holding TBG that ultimately purchased DTN and in April 2017 completed its acquisition of the company for $900M.

Since its purchase by TBG, DTN has acquired several smaller corporations or systems:
* Wilkens Weather (acquired 29 September 2017), a marine weather forecasting company based in Houston, Texas and previously owned by Rockwell Collins.
* Spensa Technologies (acquired 2 April 2018), a precision agriculture technology company founded in January 2009 and based in the Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana.
* Energy Management Institute (acquired 10 April 2018), a provider of training services and marketing analysis based in New York City.
* Weather Decision Technologies (acquired 8 October 2018), a provider of weather decision support solutions based in Norman, Oklahoma.
* PraxSoft (acquired 10 June 2019), previously Praxis Software, a provider of sensor interfaces and communications technology based in Orlando, Florida.
* Weatherzone (acquired 1 October 2019), a weather information provider based in Australia.
* ClearAg and ClearPath (acquired May 2020 for $12M), a system created by California-based Iteris for monitoring and predicting agricultural conditions and Winter Road Maintenance.
* Farm Market iD (acquired February 2021), a provider of aggregated farm and grower data based in Westmont, Illinois.
* Online Fuels (acquired May 2021), a UK-based online trading platform for refined fuels.

MeteoGroup, a private Europe-based weather organisation acquired by parent TBG in September 2018, has been integrated into DTN.

==Business sectors==

===Aviation===

DTN is one of the main suppliers of weather intelligence to the aviation industry. DTN&#x27;s weather data and patented algorithms for EDR Turbulence, Icing and (Rapid Developing) Thunderstorms flow directly to airlines and airports or via one of DTN&#x27;s many partners for Electronic Flight Bags(EFB) and Flight Planning. The data helps keeping crew and passengers safe in the air, especially around turbulence and thunderstorms events. DTN is delivering weather intelligence directly or indirectly to over 250 airlines worldwide. DTN has a large team of Aviation meteorologists in-house who support Aviation customers with (risk)consulting and creating e.g. RAMTAFs.

===Agriculture===
DTN&#x27;s agricultural division sells services to farmers and agribusinesses.
* For farmers and other producers, DTN provides ag market information, insights on market prices and strategies, and detailed weather information and forecasts. DTN also creates applications used by growers to determine the best time to work fields or spray for pests, and offers Adapt-N-based field nitrogen analysis and planning.
* For agribusinesses DTN offers market information and analysis, tools to manage grain trading and communications with growers, weather reports, and other services.

Since 2007 DTN has owned and operated &quot;The Progressive Farmer&quot;, a 600,000-circulation farm and agribusiness magazine founded in 1886. DTN serves about 50,000 growers in North America and most leading agribusinesses.

===Weather===
DTN generates weather reports, forecasts, and analysis aimed at consumers in seven sectors: aviation, marine, utilities, renewable energy, transportation, sports, and construction/public safety. Forecasts and reports are based on large data sets that combine proprietary information from DTN&#x27;s network of 6,000 weather stations with other global content sources. One such source is DTN Services and Systems Spain, where D-ATIS and D-VOLMET systems are manufactured for the company. Combining the various data into a single forecast is done in part through the National Center for Atmospheric Research&#x27;s Dynamic Integrated foreCast (DICast), a technology licensed from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. DTN employs 120+ professional meteorologists in strategic locations globally.

The company&#x27;s forecasts were ranked as the most accurate in the US each year since 2006 for predictions of short-term precipitation and high temperatures. WeatherSentry Online is DTN Weather&#x27;s principal platform.

In October 2024 a technical fault affecting the supplying of data to the United Kingdom&#x27;s BBC Weather service caused the latter&#x27;s website and app to incorrectly forecast wind speeds of over and air temperatures exceeding .

===Oil and gas===
In the energy sector DTN focuses on the buying, selling, transportation, and storage of fuel. DTN offers real-time fuel market data, tools to monitor how fuel is distributed, and software for managing and automating fuel storage.

===Trading===

<doc id="716485" wikidata="Q1573435" url="?curid=716485" title="Oni (video game)">
<text>Oni is a third-person action video game developed by Bungie West, a division of Bungie. It was originally released by Gathering of Developers for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS in 2001; a PlayStation 2 port developed by Rockstar Canada was released the same year. It was Bungie West&#x27;s only game. Gameplay consists of third-person shooting with hand-to-hand combat, with a focus on the latter. The game&#x27;s style was largely inspired by &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and &quot;Akira&quot; and shares the same genre, being set in a cyberpunk world.

==Plot==
The events of &quot;Oni&quot; take place in or after the year 2032. In the game, Earth is so polluted that little of it remains habitable. To solve international economic crises, all nations have combined into a single entity, the World Coalition Government. The government is totalitarian, telling the populace that what are actually dangerously toxic regions are wilderness preserves, and uses its police forces, the Technological Crimes Task Force (TCTF), to suppress opposition. The player character, code-named Konoko (voiced by Amanda Winn-Lee), begins the game working for the TCTF. Soon, she learns her employers have been keeping secrets about her past from her. She turns against them as she embarks on a quest of self-discovery. The player learns more about her family and origins while battling both the TCTF and its greatest enemy, the equally monolithic criminal organization called the Syndicate. In the game&#x27;s climax, Konoko discovers a Syndicate plan to cause the Atmospheric Conversion Centers, air-treatment plants necessary to keep most of the world&#x27;s population alive, to catastrophically malfunction. She is partially successful in thwarting the plot, saving a portion of humanity.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Oni&quot; is a third-person action game, focused on melee combat mixed with some gunplay. The player can punch, kick, and throw enemies; progressing into later levels unlocks stronger moves and combos. There are ten different guns in &quot;Oni&quot;, including handguns, rifles, rocket launchers, and energy weapons. Power-ups such as &quot;hyposprays&quot;, which heal damage, and cloaking devices, which render the player invisible, can be found scattered throughout the levels or on corpses. Since the player can carry only one weapon at a time and ammunition is scarce, hand-to-hand combat is the most effective and common means of defeating enemies.

There are multiple classes of enemy, each with its own style of unarmed combat. Each class is subdivided into tiers of increasing strength. As in Bungie&#x27;s earlier &quot;Marathon&quot; titles, tiers are color-coded, in this case by green (weakest), blue, and red (strongest). Also color-coded are the levels of health each opponent has, indicated by a flash when the player strikes or shoots them. Green flashes show the opponent has high health, red flashes show the enemy is near death.

&quot;Oni&quot; does not confine the player to fighting small groups of enemies in small arenas; each area is fully open to explore. The fourteen levels are of various sizes, some large enough to comprise an entire building. Bungie hired two architects to design the buildings.

The &quot;Oni&quot; engine implements a method of interpolation that tweens key frames, smoothing out the animation of complex martial-arts moves, but frame slippage is a common problem when multiple non-player characters near the player are attacking.

==Development==
The game was developed by a core team of about twelve people. The game&#x27;s universe is heavily influenced by Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s anime film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, with some additional influence from &quot;Akira&quot; and the works of Kenichi Sonoda. The original plan was for Konoko to be a cyborg like &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;″s Motoko Kusanagi. The explanation for her superhuman abilities was changed to be more organic with the addition of the Daodan Chrysalis concept by design lead Hardy LeBel.

&quot;Oni&quot; was originally expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 1999. Advertising was targeted towards that shipping date, and the game won E3&#x27;s Game Critics Awards for Best Action/Adventure Game in 1999. However, development difficulties caused the release date to be pushed back continuously. The acquisition of Bungie by Microsoft in 2000 then led to the transfer of the &quot;Oni&quot; IP to Take-Two Interactive (which owned 20% of the studio prior to Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition). Since Bungie&#x27;s employees were moving to the new office location in Microsoft&#x27;s headquarters or leaving the company, work on &quot;Oni&quot; had to be completed as quickly as possible. Due to a lack of time to resolve issues with the multiplayer code and to finish the levels intended for use by multiplayer mode, this functionality was omitted from the released version.

A sequel was in development at Angel Studios for two years before being cancelled due to a lack of progress and creative direction.

===Music===
Half of the music was composed by Martin O&#x27;Donnell in collaboration with Michael Salvatori. Other tracks in the game, which had already been implemented before O&#x27;Donnell and Salvatori joined the project, were composed by the music company Power of Seven, which specialized in electronic music genres such as techno and ambient. The Power of Seven team consisted of founder Paul Sebastien, as well as composer Brian Salter and Kim Cascone, who served as a sound designer for the game; the team had previously worked together at Thomas Dolby&#x27;s audio technology company Headspace. O&#x27;Donnell, who served as the game&#x27;s audio lead, decided to keep the tracks Power of Seven had already composed, while composing roughly the same amount of music himself. Select tracks from the game were made available on MP3.com in 2000, a year before the game was released. A soundtrack CD of the game&#x27;s music was bundled with purchases of the game at Best Buy.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Some reviewers were unimpressed by the minimal detail of the environment graphics, the lack of intelligence on the part of the AI in some situations, and the plot, which was occasionally criticized as underdeveloped. The game&#x27;s difficulty in combination with a lack of savepoints was sometimes cited as a negative.

The absence of LAN-based multiplayer, which had been demoed at hands-on booths at Macworld Expos during &quot;Oni&quot;″s development, but removed before release due to stated concerns over latency issues, contributed to some lower scores from reviewers. Some of the game&#x27;s content was cut as well. This included the &quot;Iron Demon&quot;, a large mech shown in-game in one trailer. Also, many of the weapons featured in the trailer and the game cover were not in the game.

On the positive side, &quot;Oni&quot; received the most praise for its smooth character animation and large array of fighting moves, as well as how it blended gunplay and melee combat. Thus, reviewers gave &quot;Oni&quot; mostly average-to-good scores in recognition of the enjoyment factor of the game. When reviewing the PlayStation 2 version, Jeff Lundgren of &quot;Next Generation&quot; commented that despite the game having a longer development time, it was worth the wait in the end.

In the United States, &quot;Oni&quot; sold 50,000 copies by October 2001.

== Anniversary Edition ==
The &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; was made by fans and the community, based on years of research, and enhances the retail copy of &quot;Oni&quot;. The first official release of the edition was made seven years after &quot;Oni&quot;″s release, hence the original name of the project, &quot;Seventh Anniversary Edition&quot;.

<text>Entropy is an abstract strategy board game for two players designed by Eric Solomon in 1977. The game is &quot;based on the eternal conflict in the universe between order and chaos [...] One player is Order, the other Chaos. Order is trying to make patterns vertically and horizontally. Chaos is trying to prevent this.&quot; The game originally employed a 5×5 gameboard, but in 2000 a 7x7 board was introduced to allow deeper strategies. 

&quot;Entropy&quot; was awarded a rare 6 out of 6 by &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles Magazine&quot; in 1981. David Pritchard called the game &quot;a modern classic&quot;. It is sold commercially under the names &quot;Hyle&quot; (a 5×5 board) and &quot;Hyle7&quot; (a 7×7 board).

==Rules==
The gameboard is a square grid of 7×7 cells. A game consists of two rounds. Each round starts with the board empty, and a bag containing 49 chips in seven colours. 

The first player to move (Chaos) draws coloured chips at random from the bag and places each one on the board in an empty cell. For each chip that is placed, the second player (Order) may slide any chip horizontally or vertically any distance through empty cells, to rest in a currently empty cell, without jumping over any other chips already on the board. When the board becomes full, the round is finished. Order scores 1 point for each chip in any palindromic pattern of chip colours (e.g. &quot;red–green–blue–green–red&quot; scores 3 + 5 = 8 points; &quot;red–red–red&quot; scores 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 points) occurring either horizontally or vertically. The players reverse roles and play a second round. The player with the higher score as Order wins the game and draws are possible.

==Championships==
The game has been included as one of the events at the annual Mind Sports Olympiad since its inception. Demis Hassabis had won this event a record five times until losing in 2007. Demis&#x27; record was broken in 2021 by David Jameson (Wales) who won his sixth title, extending the record in 2023. The event has also been won by Hassabis&#x27;s brother George and by other Pentamind champions, David M. Pearce, Alain Dekker, Paco Garcia de la Banda and Andres Kuusk.

<doc id="716495" wikidata="Q7016153" url="?curid=716495" title="1975 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1975 New Zealand general election was held on 29 November to elect MPs to the 38th session of the New Zealand Parliament. It was the first general election in New Zealand where 18- to 20-year-olds and all permanent residents of New Zealand were eligible to vote, although only citizens were able to be elected.

The National Party, led by Rob Muldoon, won 55 of the 87 seats over the Labour Party, led by Bill Rowling, in a landslide. The election saw the defeat of the Third Labour Government after only three years in office and the formation of the Third National Government. As of 2023, this is the most recent election where a government was voted out after one term.

==Background==
The incumbent Labour Party&#x27;s decline in popularity during the previous term had as factors the death of its leader, Norman Kirk, economic decline triggered by the United Kingdom&#x27;s accession to the European Communities—most importantly the European Economic Community (EEC)—and the 1973 oil crisis.

Following the sudden death of Labour leader Kirk, the party was led by Bill Rowling, a leader who was characterised as being weak and ineffectual by some political commentators. Labour&#x27;s central campaign was the so-called &quot;Citizens for Rowling&quot; petition which attacked National leader Robert Muldoon&#x27;s forthright leadership style. This campaign was largely seen as having backfired on Labour.

The National Party responded with the formation of &quot;Rob&#x27;s Mob&quot;. As former Minister of Finance in the previous National government, Muldoon focused on the economic impact of Labour&#x27;s policies; National&#x27;s campaign advertising suggested that Labour&#x27;s recently introduced compulsory personal superannuation scheme would result in the government owning the New Zealand economy by using the worker&#x27;s money, akin to a communist state. Muldoon argued that his New Zealand superannuation scheme could be funded from future taxes rather than an additional tax on current wages.

In July 1974, Muldoon as opposition leader had promised to cut immigration and to &quot;get tough&quot; on law and order issues. He criticised the Labour government&#x27;s immigration policies for contributing to the economic recession and a housing shortage which undermined the New Zealand &quot;way of life&quot;.

During the 1975 general elections, the National Party had also played an electoral advertisement that was later criticized for stoking negative racial sentiments about Polynesian migrants.

The campaign also achieved notoriety due to an infamous television commercial featuring &quot;Dancing Cossacks&quot;, which was produced by Hanna Barbera on behalf of National&#x27;s ad agency Colenso.

A consummate orator and a skilled television performer, Muldoon&#x27;s powerful presence on screen increased his popularity with voters.

===MPs retiring in 1975===
Four National MPs and Three Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 37th Parliament:

==Opinion polling==

==Results==

The final results saw National win 55 seats, and Labour 32 seats. The party seat numbers were an exact opposite of the 1972 election, when Labour won 55 seats to National&#x27;s 32. This election also represented the biggest swing against a sitting government since 1935, outdoing the previous record set in 1972.

Robert Muldoon replaced Bill Rowling as Prime Minister, ending the term of the Third Labour government, and beginning the term of the Third National government. No minor parties won seats, though the election saw the best ever result for New Zealand&#x27;s first green political party, Values. There were 1,953,050 electors on the roll, with 1,603,733 (82.11%) voting.

While Muldoon would be re-elected twice, this would be the only time between 1969 and 1990 that National polled more votes than Labour.

Notable electorate results included the election of two Māori MPs to general seats; the first time that any Māori had been elected to a non-Māori electorate since James Carroll in 1893. The MPs in question were Ben Couch in Wairarapa and Rex Austin in Awarua.

In and , Labour was first on election night but lost when special votes were counted.

==Post-election events==
A number of local by-elections were required due to the resignations of incumbent local body politicians following the general election:

* A by-election occurred for the Invercargill City Council after councillor Norman Jones resigned after being elected to parliament, prompting a by-election. Jones was replaced on the council by J. B. Munro, whom he defeated at the parliamentary election.
* There was a by-election for Mayor of Hamilton. Mayor Mike Minogue resigned after he was elected as MP for . The by-election was win by leader of the Social Credit Party, Bruce Beetham, who had contested in 1975.

<doc id="716499" wikidata="Q1778017" url="?curid=716499" title="Kobuk River">
<text>The Kobuk River (Iñupiaq: &quot;Kuuvak&quot;; Koyukon: &quot;Hʉlghaatno&quot;), also known by the names Kooak, Kowak, Kubuk, Kuvuk, and Putnam, is a river located in the Arctic region of northwestern Alaska in the United States. It is approximately long. Draining a basin with an area of , the Kobuk River is among the largest rivers in northwest Alaska, with widths of up to 1,500 feet (460 m) and flows reaching speeds of 3–5 miles per hour (5–8 km per hour) in its lower and middle reaches. The average elevation for the Kobuk River Basin is above sea level, ranging from sea level at its mouth on the Bering Sea to 11,400 feet (3,475 m) near its headwaters in the Brooks Range.

Topography along the river includes low, rolling mountains, plains and lowlands, moderately high rugged mountainous land, and some gently sloped plateaus and highlands. The river contains an exceptional population of sheefish (&quot;Stenodus Nelma&quot;), a large predatory whitefish within the salmon family, which spawns in the river&#x27;s upper reaches during the autumn. A portion of the vast Western Arctic caribou herd utilize the Kobuk River valley as winter range.

== Course ==
It is commonly assumed that the Kobuk River issues from Walker Lake, but the headwaters of the river are actually to the east of Walker Lake in the Endicott Mountains within Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, just north of the Arctic Circle. The river flows briefly south, descending from the mountains through two spectacular canyons (Upper and Lower Kobuk Canyon), then generally west along the southern flank of the western Brooks Range in a broad wetlands valley. In the valley it passes a connected community of inland native villages, including Kobuk, Shungnak, and Ambler, where it receives the Ambler River.

In the river&#x27;s lower reaches, where it passes between the Baird Mountains and Waring Mountains, it traverses Kobuk Valley National Park, the location of the Kobuk Sand Dunes. It then passes Kiana, entering its broad delta approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of town. The Kobuk empties into the Hotham Inlet of Kotzebue Sound approximately 30 miles (48 km) southeast of the city of Kotzebue.

== History ==
The Kobuk&#x27;s Inuit name, &quot;Kuuvak&quot;, means &quot;great river&quot;. It was first transcribed by John Simpson in 1850 as &quot;Kowuk&quot;. The river was explored by Lt. G. M. Stoney, USN, in 1883–1886, who wrote the name &quot;Ku-buck&quot; but proposed that it be called &quot;Putnam&quot; in honor of Master Charles Putnam, USN, an officer of the , who was carried to sea on the ice and lost in 1882. Lt. J. C. Cantwell, USRCS, also explored the river in 1884 and 1885 and spelled the name &quot;Koowak&quot; on his map and &quot;Kowak&quot; in his text. Ivan Petroff spelled the river name &quot;Kooak&quot; in 1880, and W. H. Dall spelled it &quot;Kowk&quot; in 1870. Lt. H. T. Allen, US Army, transcribed the Koyukon Indian name for the river in 1885, which he spelled &quot;Holooatna&quot; and &quot;Holoatna.&quot;

Native peoples have hunted, fished, and lived along the Kobuk for at least 12,500 years and it has long been an important transportation route for inland peoples. In 1898, the river was the scene of a brief gold rush called the Kobuk River Stampede, which involved about 2,000 prospectors in total. Hearing of gold along the Kobuk and its tributaries, miners set out from Seattle and San Francisco on ships to reach the mouth of the Kobuk. Upon arrival they were informed by native people that it was a scam, and only about 800 traveled upriver. The result was that little or no gold was found, and only on a few tributaries of the river. In 1980 the United States Congress designated of the river downstream from Walker Lake as the Kobuk Wild and Scenic River, part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The river is considered an outstanding destination for recreational floating.

== Climate ==
The Kobuk River Basin is located just north of the Arctic Circle and has a continental climate. The summers are short and warm, while winters are long and cold. The mean annual temperature in the middle and upper portions of the Kobuk Valley is -6 °C, and the mean temperature in July is 15 °C. An average of 21 inches (53 cm) of precipitation falls in the basin. However, actual precipitation can range from 15 to 40 inches (40–100 cm), with greater amounts falling in the upper reaches of the river basin.

The Kobuk River Basin is very sensitive to changes in climate. Arctic climates have warmed at approximately twice the global rate in the last several decades. Records of air temperature from 1961 to 1990 logged at the latitudes of the Kobuk River show a warming trend of about 1.4 °F (0.78 °C) per decade. The warming has been strongest in the winter and spring months. Climate change is presently considered the most severe environmental stress in the Kobuk River Basin and throughout Alaska.

As a specific example, climate change will cause widespread thawing of permafrost in the discontinuous zone and significant changes in the continuous zone. Thawing permafrost can lead to a landscape of irregular depressions (thermokarst) due to subsiding soils. This can alter drainage patterns and even change the course of streams, whereas other areas could become swamp-like. In addition, slope stability will decrease and permafrost degradation could lead to erosion of river banks resulting in an increase in sediment transport by the rivers. These physical changes will impact nutrient cycling and biological processes within the basin as well.

== Geology and soils ==
Permafrost regions along the Kobuk River are shown in the accompanying figure.

=== Geomorphology ===

The Kobuk River is a periglacial river, fed by a remnant glacial lake (Walker Lake) and mountain snowmelt in the Brooks Range. It cuts a channel through a landscape otherwise dominated by permafrost. The Kobuk&#x27;s current form and structure is a direct result of several stages of erosion and channel formation following the last glacial retreat.

As the glacier first retreated and melted, large amounts of highly erodible, fine-grained sediment dropped out in relatively high mountain valleys. The availability of this fine-grained, loose sediment combined with a high gradient to turn a newly forming Kobuk River into a fast-working sediment transport system. The river picked up glacial till from its upper reaches and transported it downstream until the gradient diminished. When the river encountered flatter ground, it deposited its sediment load resulting in the creation of broad, flat floodplains, alluvial fans, and meander bends through aggradation.

After the first stage of aggradation and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its load carrying capacity downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream.

Further down in the Kobuk watershed, the river worked in concert with the wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes. These large sand dunes are the modern ancestor of alluvial deposits that became shaped and dominated by an exchange of aeolian and fluvial processes. In moister climates, the river has more water and thus more power, and cuts down through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates and blows a lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to aggradation and floodplain re-distribution.

Currently, the Kobuk River in its middle and lower reaches is an anastomosing stream, with several braided channels in places, wide migrating meander bends, and oxbow lakes. It is controlled by yearly cycles of freeze and thaw, much like its surrounding landscape. For six months of the year, the river is largely still, frozen on top by a thick layer of ice. In the spring, warmer temperatures cause this ice to begin to melt. But the resulting process is not gradual. Rather, the pressure of melting ice from upstream builds up upon ice &quot;dams&quot; in the river&#x27;s channel, eventually causing an &quot;ice break-up&quot; event, in which a flood of ice and water moves powerfully downstream.

These annual spring break-up events have several important consequences. First, the river has deeply undercut and eroded banks, caused by large, fast-moving chunks of ice carving out the river&#x27;s channel before it begins spilling out onto its floodplain, which averages between 1 and 6 miles (1.6 and 9.7 km) wide except at confluences with major tributaries. Second, the river moves laterally very quickly and dramatically, re-inventing side channels every year as its secondary streams become drowned in each yearly flood by an overwhelming amount of sediment. Lastly, since the river is surrounded mostly by permafrost and because during the spring break-up event there are still large parts of frozen ground close to its banks, floods often transport large amounts of fine sediment across broad expanses of floodplain in thin sheets of water that slide easily across the frozen ground. These characteristics also translate into a relatively variable habitat for the Kobuk&#x27;s native species.

Farthest west, the Kobuk empties into Hotham Inlet, the easterly arm of Kotzebue Sound. During recent geologic times, however, when sea level was lower, the Noatak, Kobuk, and Selawik Rivers were joined. Now, they have separate deltas with many lakes and swamps and intricately webbed channel systems. The deltas are composed primarily of silt, sand, and gravel.

== Surface water and hydrology ==

The Kobuk River is ice-covered for an average of six months of the year and in general, late October to late May is a period of relatively low flow. Annually, the hydrograph reflects two flood peaks: the first is associated with spring break-up and the second, a lesser peak, is associated with late summer precipitation. As the snowpack begins to melt toward the end of May, flow in the Kobuk River increases with most of the runoff occurring during June. Flow during the summer (July through September) is dominated by variable precipitation events.

Most of the major tributaries of the Kobuk River flow from the north, draining the mountains in the southern Brooks Range. From east to west, these include the Reed River, Beaver Creek, Mauneluk River, Kogoluktuk River, Shungnak River, Ambler River, Akillik River, Tutuksuk River, Salmon River, and Squirrel River. Within Kobuk Valley National Park are the Kallarichuk, Kaliguricheark, and Adillik rivers. All of their headwaters are in the Baird Mountains. The major tributaries flowing north from the Waring Mountains are the Pah River, Pick River, and Niaktuvik Creek. The Pah River drains a lowland area of the basin. Most major tributaries draining high-relief areas have higher unit runoff than tributaries draining the lower-relief areas.

Walker Lake is at an altitude of in the headwaters of the Kobuk River. Other surface water features within the basin include Lake Selby, Nutuvukti Lake, and Norutak Lake. Additionally, numerous small lakes and ponds occur in the lowlands along the river, some formed as detached oxbows of the meandering river and others formed where permafrost has melted and caused depressions.

Flow records are available from USGS monitoring stations at Ambler and Kiana. Average annual flow for the Kobuk River at Ambler ranged from to over the period of record from 1966 to 1978, with peak discharge ranging between and . Near Kiana, average annual flow ranged from to for the period from 1977 to 1999, with peaks of to . Peak flows can result from large volumes of water released when ice jams fail. Flow records are also available for Dahl Creek, a tributary of the Kobuk River with a confluence near the town of Kobuk.

<doc id="716503" wikidata="Q773547" url="?curid=716503" title="Thomas Sankara International Airport Ouagadougou">
<text>Ouagadougou Airport , officially [[Thomas Sankara]] International Airport Ouagadougou, is an international airport in the center of the capital city of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. It was built in the 1960s, and it is approximately southeast of the main commercial area. The site itself is approximately in length, in width at its narrowest point, and covers an area of approximately . Its runway is long. When the airport was built it was on the southern boundary of the city. Ouagadougou has since experienced rapid urbanization and the airport is now surrounded by urban development.

Besides having outgrown its capacity constraints, Ouagadougou Airport is a source of pollution and risk. The government has plans for a new airport 30 km north of the capital.

In addition to civilian traffic, the airport has a military sector.

Ouagadougou Airport handles about 98% of all scheduled commercial air traffic in Burkina Faso. Air Burkina and Air France handle about 60% of scheduled passenger traffic. Between 2005 and 2011, air passenger traffic at Ouagadougou airport grew at an average annual rate of 7.0%, reaching about 404,726 passengers in 2011 and was estimated to reach 850,000 by 2025.

In 2007 it was the 15th busiest airport in West Africa in passenger volume, just ahead of Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and behind Banjul (Gambia).

The total air cargo grew 71% from 4,350 tons in 2005 to about 7,448 tons in 2009.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Statistics==
==Military use==
According to a 2012 article in the Washington Post, The United States military was using the military side of the airport as the hub of its airborne intelligence operations for much of Western Africa. Its surveillance operations were carried out mainly with small, unarmed turboprop aircraft disguised as private planes, but full of surveillance equipment. The U.S. spy planes fly hundreds of kilometres north to Mali, Mauritania and the Sahara, where they search for Al-Qaida fighters from the Maghreb. The planes refuel on isolated airstrips favored by African bush pilots, extending their effective flight range by thousands of kilometres. According to the Washington Post, in 2012 Ouagadougou was the most important of the approximately dozen air bases that the U.S. established in Africa since 2007.

==Plans for a new airport==

The government plans to close the current airport upon construction of the Ouagadougou-Donsin Airport, approximately northeast of Ouagadougou near the village of Donsin. It was originally expected to be completed around 2018, and the government of Burkina Faso has an $85 million loan from the World Bank to help finance the construction. The government of Burkina Faso believed that the project would cost $618 million. The expected date of opening has been pushed back to December 2021.

The first phase of construction of the new airport was planned for a five-year period beginning in 2013 and finishing in 2018. This phase was to focus on the construction of infrastructure that was required to move the operations from Ouagadougou to Donsin. The plans called for a single runway long, which was to be longer than the one at the current airport, with an option to extend to . Generally is sufficient to land virtually any aircraft at sea level, but longer runways are helpful for heavily loaded cargo planes. Space for a second runway and its accompanying infrastructure had been reserved for when growth in air traffic warranted it.

A second expansion phase is planned for 2026–2030 to meet projected increases in demand. At this stage, however, the government of Burkina Faso is seeking investors only for Phase 1.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On September 17, 2013, a standing ATR 72-202 (EC-LNP) of Colombe Air Line leased from Helitt Lineas Aereas was substantially damaged when a heavy thunderstorm passed over the airport, with winds up to 44 knots (50.6 mph) being registered at 20:00. The plane was written off.

<text>The Kalmar Union was the personal union of the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden during the 15th century. The first king of the Kalmar Union was Eric of Pomerania. His seal combined the coats of arms of Norway (center, as an inescutcheon upon a cross over all), Denmark (in dexter chief), Sweden (the Folkung lion, in dexter base) and Pomerania (a griffin, in sinister base), and in addition the Three Crowns symbol in sinister chief; the latter heraldic design predates the Kalmar Union, and is now mostly associated with the coat of arms of Sweden, but which during the 15th century came to represent the three kingdoms of the union.

In two letters dated to 1430, Eric of Pomerania orders the priests of Vadstena and Kalmar to wear the &quot;banner of the realms&quot; on their robes. The banner is described as &quot;a red cross in a yellow field&quot;.

<doc id="716511" wikidata="Q2275677" url="?curid=716511" title="Sexual arousal disorder">
<text>Sexual arousal disorder is characterized by a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity in a situation that would normally produce sexual arousal, or the inability to attain or maintain typical responses to sexual arousal. The disorder is found in the DSM-IV. The condition should not be confused with a sexual desire disorder.

The term is often used in the diagnosis of women (female sexual arousal disorder), while the term erectile dysfunction (ED) is often used for men.

==Signs and symptoms==
In women, the symptoms of the disorder include:
* Lack of vaginal lubrication
* Lack of vaginal or lengthening
* Decreased genital tumescence or swelling
* Decreased genital or nipple 

However, whether lack of physiological arousal is a reliable symptom of the disorder is questionable. Research has shown that women with arousal deficits and women without arousal deficits show equivalent increases in physiological response during experience of erotic stimuli.

==Causes==
Contrary to popular belief, the disorder is not always caused from a lack of sexual arousal. Possible causes of the disorder include psychological and emotional factors, such as depression, anger, and stress; relationship factors, such as conflict or lack of trust; medical factors, such as depleted hormones, reduced regional blood flow, and nerve damage; and drug use. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner (i.e., situational). A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person&#x27;s life.

Certain medications like SSRIs may contribute to a loss of sexual arousal, either while taking the medication or during withdrawal. In seemingly rare cases, SSRIs have been reported to cause a reduction in sexual arousal that last months or years after discontinuation, a condition termed post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD).

==Diagnosis==
A psychologist will first consider any psychological or emotional problems; while a sex therapist will examine relationship issues; after which a medical doctor will investigate medical causes for the disorder. In order to receive this diagnosis, a woman must, for at least 6 months, report at least 3 of the following symptoms: absent or significantly reduced interest in sexual activity, in sexual or erotic thoughts or fantasies, in initiation of sex or receptiveness to sex, in excitement or pleasure in most sexual encounters, in sexual responsiveness to erotic cues, or in genital or non-genital responses to sexual activity. This can be either lifelong or acquired.

==Treatment==
Depending on the cause of the disorder, hormone therapy or a blood-flow enhancing medication, like Viagra, may be appropriate.

Bremelanotide (formerly PT-141) is being studied in clinical tests to increase sexual desire in women. In 2014, Palatin, the company developing the drug, announced the beginning of a Phase 3 clinical trial to determine its effectiveness.

Vibrators have also been found to be effective at addressing sexual arousal disorder. Sometimes described as a massager, the vibrator is used on the body to produce sexual stimulation. Examples of FDA registered vibrators for sexual arousal disorder include MysteryVibe&#x27;s Crescendo.

<doc id="716521" wikidata="Q4820234" url="?curid=716521" title="Audubon Ballroom">
<text>The Audubon Theatre and Ballroom, generally referred to as the Audubon Ballroom, was a theatre and ballroom located at 3940 Broadway at West 165th Street in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It was built in 1912 and was designed by Thomas W. Lamb. The theatre was known at various times as the William Fox Audubon Theatre, the Beverly Hills Theater, and the San Juan Theater. The ballroom is noted for being the site of the assassination of Malcolm X on February 21, 1965. It is currently the Audubon Business and Technology Center, which is part of Columbia University&#x27;s Audubon Research Park.

==History==
The Audubon Ballroom was built in 1912 by film producer William Fox, who later founded the Fox Film Corporation. Fox hired Thomas W. Lamb, one of the foremost American theater architects, to design the building. The building contained a theatre with 2500 seats, and a second-floor ballroom that could accommodate 200 seated guests. During its history, the Audubon Ballroom was used as a vaudeville house, a movie theater, and a meeting hall where political activists often met.

In the 1930s, Congregation Emes Wozedek, a synagogue whose members were predominantly immigrants from Germany, began to use basement rooms of the Audubon Ballroom to conduct its religious services. At around the same time, several trade unions, including the Municipal Transit Workers, the IRT Brotherhood Union, and the Transport Workers&#x27; Union, utilized the meeting rooms. In 1950, the congregants purchased the building, and they continued to hold services there until 1983.

Among the many events held at the Ballroom was the annual New York Mardi Gras Festival.

After Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam in 1964, he founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), whose weekly meetings were held at the Audubon Ballroom. It was at one of those meetings, on February 21, 1965, that Malcolm X was assassinated as he was giving a speech.

Because of non-payment of property taxes, New York City took possession of the theatre in 1967. Nevertheless, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Ballroom operated as the San Juan Theater, showing films which catered to the increasingly Hispanic neighborhood. It closed in 1980, and the building remained vacant and the exterior deteriorated.

===Adaptive reuse===
In 1989, Columbia University, with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a partner, reached an agreement with the city, and in 1992 it began the process of demolishing the Audubon Ballroom to replace it with a medical research facility. Although many city officials, including Mayor David Dinkins, were strongly in favor of the project because of the jobs and economic impetus it would bring to the area, which had suffered greatly in the economic downturn of the 1970s, community activists and Columbia University students – who occupied Hamilton Hall on campus – protested the planned demolition, and historic preservation groups unsuccessfully sued to prevent it. They were also unable to persuade the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold a hearing on giving the building landmark status.

Eventually a compromise was reached, at least in part due to pressure brought by Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and Malcolm X&#x27;s widow, Betty Shabazz, who both favored adaptive reuse of the building. They were supported by a report on its structural integrity produced by a &quot;pro bono&quot; team of architects assembled by the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Municipal Art Society. The compromise allowed Columbia to build on the northern part of the building their research facility – now the Audubon Business and Technology Center in the Mary Woodard Lasker Biomedical Research Building, part of the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park a public-private partnership between Columbia University Medical Center and the New York state and city governments. In return, two-thirds of the Audubon Ballroom&#x27;s original facade – the part along Broadway and West 165th Street – would be preserved and restored. In addition, a portion of the interior ballroom where Malcolm X was killed was restored and protected, to be made into a museum honoring him.

In 2005, the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center opened in the lobby to commemorate the contributions Malcolm X made to the civil rights movement.

==Architecture==
Architect Thomas Lamb, who later would design the nearby eclectic United Palace, was an advocate of the use of ornamentation and color on his building&#x27;s exteriors. He would write: &quot;Exotic ornaments, colors and scenes are particularly effective in creating an atmosphere in which the mind is free to frolic and becomes receptive to entertainment.&quot; In line with this philosophy, the facade of the Audubon Ballroom presents terra-cotta glazed polychromy, encrustations and cornices. Its ornamentations include brown foxes between the windows on the second floor, intended to flatter Fox, and, most prominently, a colorful protruding three-dimensional statue of Neptune on a ship.

Alterations to the building in 1996 were made by the architecture firm of Davis Brody Bond, who also designed Columbia University&#x27;s new building, while the restoration of the facade was handled by preservation specialist Jan Hird Pokorny.

<doc id="716526" wikidata="Q2353767" url="?curid=716526" title="M-86 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-86 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan in the southern portion of the Lower Peninsula. The highway starts at Business US Highway 131 (Bus. US 131) and M-60 in Three Rivers and ends at US Highway 12 (US 12) near Coldwater. In between, it crosses farm country and runs along a section of the Prairie River. Following a highway originally numbered M-7, the roadway was renumbered M-86 in 1940. It has been a part of the state highway system at least since 1927. Two other roadways carried the M-86 designation in the 1920s. Two bridges along the road are eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

==Route description==
M-86 begins in Three Rivers at a junction with Bus. US 131 and M-60. From there the road travels south out of town on Main Street and across the St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along a bend in the river, and it runs parallel to the river out of town. As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a typical day of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642 vehicles including 138 trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66.

From the junction, M-86 and M-66 run concurrently to the north for about , at which point M-86 branches off to the east while M-66 continues on a northerly route. M-86 continues east through agricultural land into the village of Colon. The highway follows South Street and turns north on Blackstone Avenue between Sturgeon and Palmer lakes. Turning to follow State Street, the trunkline heads out of the village to the southeast. It continues eastward along Colon Road, passing north of Matteson Lake near Matteson and through Batavia Center. In Coldwater Township, M-86 experienced its lowest traffic level in 2009 at 1,872 vehicles and 129 trucks AADT. The highway terminates at US 12 west of Coldwater near the Branch County Memorial Airport and Messenger Lake. No segment of M-86 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Previous designations===

Upon its inception in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924–25, M-66 was extended north to Remus, supplanting the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in Orleans to M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from Orleans to junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 to be supplanted and removed from the highway system.

===Current designation===

By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had designated a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway was extended east by the middle of 1936. The route connected US 131 in downtown Three Rivers to US 112 outside Coldwater. At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers and Colon was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937.

In 1940, at the same time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 designation replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. In late 1948 or early 1949, the last section of highway was paved in Branch County, hard-surfacing all of M-86 for the first time. A change related to M-66 and M-78 altered M-86 in 1965. South of Battle Creek, M-66 replaced M-78. Rather than follow M-78 between Colon and Athens, M-66 used a different series of roads. The net result was that along M-86, the M-78 concurrency was replaced by a shorter M-66 concurrency. The routing has remain unchanged since.

===Historic bridges===
M-86 currently uses one bridge eligible for listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers was built in 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to look as though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project.

The second historic structure was the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This camelback pony truss span was moved to that location in 1938–39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one on either side of the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area. The structure was moved to Crystal Springs Road in Cass County&#x27;s Pokagon Township in 2016.

<text>The City of Port Adelaide Enfield (PAE), located across inner north and north-western suburbs of Adelaide, is one of the largest metropolitan councils within South Australia. It was established on 26 March 1996 by the amalgamation of the City of Port Adelaide and the City of Enfield.

Extending from the River Torrens to Outer Harbor, and covering an area of approximately 97 km2, Port Adelaide Enfield contains some of South Australia&#x27;s finest historical buildings and landmarks. The Port Adelaide area is known as the History Precinct, as it is home to the Maritime Museum, the National Railway Museum and the Aviation Museum.

, the current mayor is Claire Boan, who was elected in 2018. There are 17 ward councillors who represent the residents and businesses of their wards at council meetings.

==History==
The City of Port Adelaide Enfield was established on 26 March 1996 by the amalgamation of the City of Port Adelaide and the City of Enfield.
The council of Port Adelaide was established on 27 December 1855 when Port Adelaide was declared a Corporate Town centred at the port of Adelaide, which had been opened some years prior in 1837. From 1884 to 1900 five adjacent district councils were amalgamated with the Corporate Town of Port Adelaide, dramatically increasing its size. In 1901 Port Adelaide was proclaimed a city by Governor Tennyson.
Centred around the township of Enfield, the District Council of Yatala south was formed in 1868 when the District Council of Yatala was divided in two. Dry Creek and the Dry Creek-Port Adelaide railway line formed the new council&#x27;s northern boundary. In 1933, Yatala South was renamed to be Enfield Council. In 1944 Enfield District Council became a municipality and in 1953, thanks to the post-war boom in population, it was upgraded to city status.

<text>The Star of India is a 563.35-carat (112.67 g) star sapphire, one of the largest such gems in the world. It is almost flawless and is unusual in that it has stars on both sides of the stone. The greyish-blue gem was mined in Sri Lanka and is housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

The milky quality of the stone is caused by the traces of the mineral rutile, which is also responsible for the star effect, known as asterism. The tiny fibers of the mineral, aligned in a three-fold pattern within the gem, reflect incoming light into the star pattern.

== History ==
Mineralogist and Tiffany gem expert George Kunz (1856–1932) was commissioned by wealthy financier J. P. Morgan (1837–1913) to acquire an impressive gem collection for an exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900; the Star of India was among the stones Kunz procured. The Star of India is a huge blue star sapphire weighing 563.35 carats. It is cut en cabochon. A British Army officer brought it to London, where it was cut by Albert Ramsay around 1905. Morgan donated the Star of India along with the rest of the collection to the American Museum of Natural History. Apart from its Sri Lankan origin, the gem&#x27;s history prior to its acquisition for this collection is unknown. Kunz wrote in 1913 that the Star of India &quot;has a more or less indefinite historic record of some three centuries&quot;.

On October 29, 1964, the famous golf-ball-sized stone was stolen, along with several other gems of note, including the Midnight Star, the DeLong Star Ruby, and the Eagle Diamond. The thieves unlocked a bathroom window during museum open hours, climbed in that night, and found that the sapphire was the only gem in the collection protected by an alarm—and the battery for that was dead. The stones stolen were valued at more than $400,000. Within two days the culprits were arrested: Jack Roland Murphy (also known as &quot;Murph the Surf&quot;), Allan Kuhn and Roger Clark; however, the gems had already been handed off. In January 1965, in a bid for leniency, Kuhn led authorities to a bus locker in Miami where the uninsured Star of India and some of the other stolen stones were recovered.

<doc id="716542" wikidata="Q734729" url="?curid=716542" title="Imam Khomeini International Airport">
<text>Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport () is the international airport of Tehran, the capital of Iran. It is located 2 kilometers (1 mi) of Vahnabad and southwest of Tehran and is named for Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran&#x27;s first supreme leader. The airport is operated by Imam Khomeini Airport City Company. It covers and has two terminals and two runways. All international flights into Tehran are served by the airport, and all domestic flights land at Mehrabad Airport. Imam Khomeini Airport is a hub for multiple airlines. As of the fiscal year ending on 20 March 2019, it ranked third in terms of passenger traffic in Iran.

The airport was conceived before the 1979 revolution, as Mehrabad Airport was becoming congested. It was scheduled to open in May 2004 under the management of Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV), a Turkish-Austrian consortium. However, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shut it down soon after the first plane landed, citing security fears over allowing foreigners to run the airport. Conservatives in parliament said that TAV had business ties with Iran&#x27;s enemy Israel. The company stated it had no relationship with the country. The airport reopened in April 2005 with four Iranian carriers in charge of operations. In 2019, a second terminal was completed.

== Geography ==
The airport city is located at the end of Rabat Karim and Ray counties in Tehran province and under Vahnabad Rural District (formerly a part of it). During the construction of this airport, the southern village of Nodeh was integrated into the airport as a whole from the entire Vahnabad Rural District.

A large part of the land north of the airport (now under the northern belt of the airport city) consists of the land donated by local residents Hasan Latifiyan and his wife Zahra Abdullahi for the construction and expansion of the airport (before the creation of the airport city). Part of the CNS equipment of the airport city, such as the special ILS approach and the right runway 29 (29R) as the main landing strip for foreign planes and the side taxiway, are located in this area.

==History==
===Construction and initial opening===
The Iranian government decided prior to the 1979 revolution to build a new airport for Tehran. The city was then the centre of the Middle East, and air traffic was increasing quickly at the existing Mehrabad Airport. The new airport was initially called Tehran or Aryamehr International Airport, and the original designers were the American company Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton and the Iranian firm Farman-Farmayan. In 1977, construction began southwest of Tehran. The revolution and war with Iraq caused delays, and work on the runway recommenced in 1989. Due to the economic impact of the war and Iran&#x27;s isolation in the international community, President Akbar Rafsanjani focused on other endeavours in the early 1990s. In 1995, the French firm Aéroports de Paris was selected as the primary consultant, and construction of the terminal, which Paul Andreu had redesigned, started. By 2000, the airport had been renamed after Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

In 2003, Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV), a Turkish-Austrian consortium, reached an agreement with the reformist administration of Mohammad Khatami to operate the terminal and construct a second one. It made an initial investment of million in the project. The deal symbolised a shift away from the viewpoint in the government that foreign investment was a form of imperialism. President Khatami inaugurated the airport on 1 February 2004 during celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the revolution. The plan was for it to handle all international flights to Tehran. Officials wanted the airport to represent Iran&#x27;s opening to the international community and hoped it would become the largest in the Middle East. The Economist Intelligence Unit commented that the Dubai airport already served as a hub in the region and that the new airport was unlikely to overcome existing barriers to tourism such as the government&#x27;s rigid social rules.

Some Iranians including the directors of two airlines objected to the deal with TAV. Their primary concern was that Turkey had links to Iran&#x27;s foe Israel. On 7 May 2004, the military forced TAV&#x27;s staff to leave the premises with their equipment and granted management of the facility to Iran Air. The following day, an Emirates flight from Dubai became the first to land. Hours later, however, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps closed the airport by driving tanks onto the runway. It threatened to use anti-aircraft fire against the second incoming flight, which fighter jets escorted to Isfahan. The rest of the flights were diverted to Mehrabad. The guards said it was unsafe and an affront to national dignity for foreigners to be in charge of the largest airport in Iran. Conservatives in parliament stated that the consortium had done business with Israel. TAV responded that it had no association with the country.

Later that year, the conservative-dominated parliament impeached Khatami&#x27;s minister of transportation, Ahmad Khorram, partly because of the TAV contract. It also granted itself the right to veto the deal and another one that the government had signed with a Turkish firm. The agreement with TAV was ultimately annulled. The incident soured relations between Iran and Turkey. According to Ray Takeyh, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, the likely reason for the closure was that &quot;the local interest, particularly Revolutionary Guards, desired a greater share of the profits&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; made similar comments. The latter also described the airport as a symbol of the divide between those Iranians who wanted to engage more with the world and those who did not.

===Second opening===
On 30 April 2005, the $350 million Imam Khomeini Airport reopened under the management of a consortium of four Iranian airlines—Caspian Airlines, Iran Aseman Airlines, Kish Air and Mahan Air. No ceremony was held to mark the occasion due to persistent tensions. The first arrival was an Iran Air flight from Dubai. In the beginning, the airport only had flights to a few Middle Eastern countries. By March 2008, all international flights excluding those for the Hajj and Umrah had relocated from Mehrabad to Imam Khomeini Airport. The airport also signed an agreement in 2016 with Milan-based Italian firm to manage the airport&#x27;s handling activities.

Air France, Alitalia, British Airways and KLM resumed service to Tehran in 2016 following the Iran nuclear deal. Thai Airways commenced service to Iran as well. All five carriers suspended their flights two years later, stating that they were not financially viable. Analysts said the main reason for the airlines&#x27; decisions was that the United States had exited the nuclear agreement and decided to reinstate sanctions on Iran. In June 2019, President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated the Salaam International Terminal.

==Infrastructure==
The airport occupies and is operated by Imam Khomeini Airport City Company, which is part of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. It has two terminals: Terminal 1 and the Salaam International Terminal. Terminal 1 is shaped like an arc whose ends merge into the desert horizon. A third terminal called Iranshahr is in the planning phase. There are two runways:
*11L/29R: 
*11R/29L: 
The first of 11L/29R are made of concrete, the rest of asphalt. 11R/29L is entirely made of asphalt. An instrument landing system was installed in August 2009. Imam Khomeini Airport was the first in Iran to have one.

In 2015, French corporation AccorHotels opened a Novotel and an Ibis hotel on the airport premises, marking the entry of the first international hotel chain into the Iranian market since the 1979 revolution. The company was motivated by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Rexan International Airport Hotels has since taken over management of the hotels and renamed them Rexan and Remis, respectively.

==Airlines and destinations==
Most of the airlines that fly into Imam Khomeini Airport are based in Turkey and the Middle East. The airport is served by two Western airlines, Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines. It is a hub for Iran Air, Iran Aseman Airlines, Mahan Air and Meraj Airlines. Imam Khomeini Airport receives all international flights to Tehran, while Mehrabad Airport caters to domestic traffic. There are flights to several cities in the Middle East and the rest of Asia such as Damascus, Guangzhou and Mumbai. Tehran is also linked to destinations in Europe like London and Moscow. In the fiscal year ending on 20 March 2019, the airport handled 7.27 million passengers, making it the third busiest in Iran. It received 142,000 tonnes of cargo, and the number of aircraft movements was 47,000.

==Ground transportation==
Imam Khomeini International Airport is accessible from Tehran via the Tehran–Qom and Tehran–Saveh freeways. It is also served by a station on Line 1 of the Tehran Metro, which opened in August 2017.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 15 July 2009, Caspian Airlines Flight 7908, a Tupolev Tu-154 bound for Yerevan, Armenia, crashed in Qazvin province 16 minutes after take-off from Imam Khomeini International Airport. All 168 passengers and crew were killed.
* On 8 January 2020, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shortly after takeoff from the airport, killing all 176 people on board.
* On October 26, 2024, the airport was hit by precision military airstrikes launched by Israel in retaliation to recent ballistic missile attacks

<doc id="716546" wikidata="Q5494920" url="?curid=716546" title="Fred Crisman">
<text>Fred Lee Crisman (July 22, 1919 – December 10, 1975) was a fighter pilot and later educator from Tacoma, Washington known for claims of paranormal events and ties to 20th century conspiracies.

In 1946, Crisman claimed to have battled with non-humans in caves during the Second World War. The following year, he attempted to convince two early flying saucer witnesses that lava rocks were in fact debris dropped from a flying saucer. In 1968, Crisman was subpoenaed by a New Orleans grand jury in the prosecution of a local man for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy—a prosecution that would later be dramatized in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK.

Conspiracy authors consider Crisman &quot;a nexus point for a number of conspiracies and cover-ups from the late 1940s until [his] death in 1975&quot;.

==Early life==
Crisman was born on July 22, 1919, the only child of Fred M. Crisman and wife Eva (born Eva Pitchers, died Eva White, 1971). In 1933, he and his family moved to Vale, Oregon; His father ran a hotel there.

In 1939, Crisman graduated from Vale Union High School.
After attending Eastern Oregon College during 1939–40, Crisman left, working as a brakeman for the Union Pacific Railroad.

==Military career==

On May 26, 1942, Crisman enlisted in the Army, entering the service with the rank of second lieutenant. In 1943, Crisman was listed an aviation cadet undergoing training at Lancaster, California. He was awarded the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Crisman left the Army as a First Lieutenant on February 19, 1946.

==Veterans advocate==
In April 1946, Crisman served as representative of the Washington state bureau of veterans&#x27; affairs when he called for safety inspections of some used cars. That month, Crisman filed to run for coroner. In May, Crisman addressed the Tacoma Real Estate board in the Hotel Winthrop about veterans&#x27; real estate problems. In August 1946, Crisman, then described as the head of the state department of veterans&#x27; affairs, addressed the Seattle American Veterans chapter. Later that month, he addressed the Lions Club. On November 5, Crisman lent his name to an ad endorsing Hugh J. Rosellini for prosecutor. In November 1946, Crisman, then described as a special investigator for the bureau, gave a speech about mental illness in returning servicemen to the Kiwanis club at the Hotel Winthrop. In December 1946, Crisman was elected to represent Washington members of veterans organization AMVETS at an upcoming session.

==Relationship with Ray Palmer and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;==
In 1946–47, pulp magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was an outlet for fantasy, science-fiction, and fringe claims. The May 1946 issue, for example, included purportedly-true fringe adventures by Richard Sharpe Shaver, the fiction of Dorothy &amp; John de Courcy written in the style of Shaver, a defense of the religions of Tibet by Millen Cooke, the fiction of Robert Moore Williams, an allegedly-true eyewitness account of unidentified objects in the skies by Dirk Wylie, and other genre-blurring texts.

===Promotion of the Shaver mystery===
In June 1946, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; published a pseudonymous letter by Crisman in which he claimed to have battled &quot;mysterious and evil&quot; underground creatures to free himself from a cave in what is now northern Pakistan during World War II.
Wrote Crisman:
I flew my last combat mission on May 26 [1945] when I was shot up over Bassein and ditched my ship in Ramaree Roads off Chedubs Island. I was missing five days. I requested leave at Kashmere. I and Capt. (deleted by request) left Srinagar and went to Rudok then through the Khesa pass to the northern foothills of the Kabakoram. We found what we were looking for. We knew what we were searching for.
For heaven&#x27;s sake, drop the whole thing! You are playing with dynamite. My companion and I fought our way out of a cave with submachine guns. I have two 9&quot; scars on my left arm that came from wounds given me in the cave when I was 50 feet from a moving object of any kind and in perfect silence. The muscles were nearly ripped out. How? I don&#x27;t know. My friend has a hole the size of a dime in his right bicep. It was seared inside. How we don&#x27;t know. But we both believe we know more about the Shaver Mystery than any other pair.
You can imagine my fright when I picked up my first copy of Amazing Stories and see you splashing words about the subject.
Do not print our names, we are not cowards, but we are not crazy.
The letter was quoted in the September 1946 issue of Harper&#x27;s Magazine as an example of a crackpot letter. In May 1947, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; published a second Crisman letter, this time identifying him by name. In this letter, Crisman claimed to have traveled to Alaska with his friend Dick, who was killed there.

===Role in Maury Island incident===
In 1947, Crisman was involved with Harold Dahl in the Maury Island incident, an early UFO incident widely considered to be a hoax, even within Ufology. Dahl believed the 1960s TV series, &quot;The Invaders&quot; was based on Crisman&#x27;s life.

In the January 1950 issue of &quot;Fate Magazine&quot;, Crisman insisted the incident was not a hoax. Wrote Crisman: &quot;Why, if we were such blackguards and deliberately caused the deaths of two Air Force Pilots and the loss of a $150,000 airplane did not the government or some agency there attempt to seek justice through the courts of the state and federal government&quot;.

On July 22, 1967, Crisman spoke at a UFO convention in Seattle about the Maury Island incident.

==University student==
In Fall 1947, Crisman participated in college community theater in La Grande. In April 1949, Crisman was listed as acting public relations officer of Oregon&#x27;s first chapter of AMVETS. In summer 1949, Crisman gave talk on &quot;The Far East&quot; to a Kiwanis Club.
In February 1950, a letter by Crisman was entered into the congressional record. Wrote Crisman: &quot;China has fallen to the Reds [...] Indo-china is on the verge and will go soon.&quot; Crisman continued &quot;It makes me mad to see it all go, while people I thought were in the &#x27;know&#x27; grovel and back up before a gang of international brigands whose only difference from the Nazis is the cut of their uniforms. I no longer think the people guiding our state department know just what they are doing...&quot;.

In September 1950, Crisman was a Willamette University student. In October 1950, he wrote a letter to the editor complaining about the inability of local barbers to give a military trim. In 1951, while studying at Willamette University, Crisman received a teaching assignment at Salem High. On June 10 1951, Crisman was awarded a Bachelor&#x27;s of Arts.

==Return to the military==

Amid the Korean War, in April 1951, it was reported that Crisman had been ordered to active duty. That conflict ended in July 1953.

==Teaching career==
In 1953, he returned to teaching in Elgin, Oregon. He worked as a teacher and administrator in high schools in Washington and Oregon.

In December 1953, Crisman served as director of the high school drama club. In 1955, Crisman accepted a job as superintendent at Huntington. On April 15, 1957, Crisman was charged with drunken disorderly, resisting arrest, and pulling a firearm on the arresting officer; He was fined $100.

In 1958, Crisman was cited in connection with a local tradition of a fictional high school student at White River High. Also in 1958, Crisman took a course at Pacific Lutheran University. In 1959, Crisman organized a fundraising project that sold booklets about the varsity basketball team. In 1960, Crisman&#x27;s civics class authored a letter to the editor on the Caryl Chessman death penalty case, arguing &quot;Has the time come when the United States takes orders from other countries? The Chessman case is a problem which is testing the judicial stability of the United States. The exterior infiltration on the United States and the exterior infiltration of the State of California should not force our government to bow down to the opinions of other nations and countries.&quot; Crisman resigned from White River High in June 1960.

By 1962, Crisman was attached to Rainer High School. In 1964, Crisman began teaching in the Turner school district, and it was reported his book on &quot;Industrial Recruiting&quot; had been accepted for publication. In April 1965, his post was listed as journalism teacher. On February 21, 1966, Crisman was suspended and later dismissed from his teaching position at Cascade High on a charge of insubordination and &quot;creating a secret society&quot;. The board added that &quot;the organization is of such a nature that should not be condoned or authorized to exist in this district.&quot; District officials said the society had been limited to five students, and officials declined to disclose the nature of the organization.

==Business and politics==
In 1966, an FBI informant claimed that Crisman had transported $100,000 in cash to California, was doing business as a psychologist, and was suspected of operating a diploma mill. In July 1966, &quot;Fate Magazine&quot; ran an ad for the &quot;Western Division of the Parapsychological Society&quot; inviting new members to join by contacting &quot;F. Lee Crisman, PhD&quot;. In November 1966, Crisman founded The Professional Research Bureau, with T. Edward Beckham and Searoba Bates, seeking &quot;to conduct research and consultation within the fields of peology research and industrial psychology, public relations and criminology&quot;.

==Role in the Clay Shaw trial==
On March 1, 1967, New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw was arrested for conspiring to assassinate John Kennedy. According to controversial district attorney Jim Garrison, the first person Shaw called after being charged was Fred Crisman.
On October 31, 1968, a grand jury in New Orleans issued a subpoena for Fred Lee Crisman in connection with the investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination. District attorney Jim Garrison issued a press release, writing:
Mr. Crisman has been engaged in undercover activity for a part of the industrial warfare complex for years. His cover is that of a &quot;preacher&quot; and a person &quot;engaged in work to help gypsies.&quot;

Our information indicates that since the early 1960s he has made many trips to the New Orleans and Dallas areas in connection with his undercover work for that part of the warfare industry engaged in the manufacture of what is termed, in military language, a &quot;hardware&quot;—meaning those weapons sold to the U.S. government which are uniquely large and expensive.
Mr. Crisman is a &quot;former&quot; employee of the Boeing Aircraft Company in the sense that one defendant in the case is a &quot;former&quot; employee of Lockheed Aircraft Company in Los Angeles. In intelligence terminology this ordinarily means that the connection still exists but that the &quot;former employee&quot; has moved into an underground operation. More often than not a &quot;bad record&quot; or evidence indicating that he has been &quot;fired&quot; is prepared for the parent company to increase the disassociation between the two.
That same day, Crisman was arrested by Tacoma police for reckless driving.

On November 21, 1968, Crisman was deposed in the case against Clay Shaw. 
By January 9, 1969, Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorist Richard E. Sprague was privately accusing Crisman of being one of the three tramps.

==Broadcasting and politics==
Starting on August 1, 1968, Crisman hosted a radio talk show under the pseudonym &quot;Jon Gold&quot; on station KAYE. Crismann authored a pamphlet, under his radio name Jon Gold, titled &quot;What to do until Sanity Returns&quot; which he advertised on his show. The work denounced sensitivity training as &quot;Communist-oriented&quot; brainwashing. Crisman&#x27;s pamphlet called for widespread infiltration and disruption of civic organizations like Parent-Teacher Associations. Wrote Crisman:
:&quot;You must take a page from the Communist Manifesto... You must learn to halt the elections at P-TA units. Do not stop with school organizations, infiltrate each garden club, suborn its social policy and convert it to an agit-prop group.&quot;

In January 1969, Crisman was sued for libel along with other KAYE personalities by a city official who had been accused of being a communist; The case was dismissed.

Crisman authored a book, &quot;The Murder of a City, Tacoma&quot; published in 1970 through Transistor Publishing Company. The book was described by reviewer Michael Sullivan as a &quot;weird, politically slanted rant&quot; that manages to &quot;tie corruption in Tacoma to everything from communist infiltrators to the Kennedy assassination&quot;.

In November 1970, KAYE was the subject of hearings by the FCC amid complaints that the station violated the Fairness Doctrine. Crisman&#x27;s behavior was the subject of extensive discussion, with one witness arguing his playing of &quot;Nazi war songs&quot; had jeopardized the station&#x27;s licence. Citizens opposed to KAYE discussed the stations promotion of the antisemitic conspiracy theories and presented transcripts of Crisman making anti-black comments. One listener reported that &quot;she heard a KAYE broadcast of the Jon Gold Show in which reference was made by a caller to getting rid of Rowlands in the manner which President John Kennedy and his brother were disposed of&quot;. Crisman resigned from KAYE. Two subpoenas were issued for Crisman to appear before the hearings, but he disappeared and could not be located.

In 1970, Crisman was appointed to the Library Board, despite objections about his false claims of having held a doctorate. Crisman was elected Vice-President of the Tacoma library board. Crisman was named as a possible investor in Tacoma cable television. Local news discussed whether a gun had been allowed inside KAYE.

==Final years==
Beginning in 1970, a photocopied document called the &quot;Torbitt Document&quot; or &quot;Nomenclature of an Assassination&quot; circulated among Kennedy assassination buffs claimed that Crisman was one of the &quot;three tramps&quot; allegedly employed by a secret government agency. The document incorrectly names him &quot;Chrismon&quot; and falsely claims he was a Syrian immigrant.

In 1971, Crisman ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the civil service board. In 1973, Crisman resigned from the Tacoma Library Board of Directors.
Crisman unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Tacoma city council. In September 1974, Crisman was hospitalized for kidney failure. On April 12, 1975, Crisman married Mary Frances Borden.

In April 1975, &quot;True Magazine&quot; published a photo of Crisman, speculating he was one of the &quot;three hobos&quot; of JFK conspiracy lore. The November 1975 issue of &quot;Crawdaddy Magazine&quot; repeated this claim and further claimed, without evidence, that &quot;Olympia police suspected [Crisman] of narcotics activity in connection with a group called &quot;Servants of Awareness&quot;.

Fred Crisman died on December 10, 1975. At his death, it was noted that Crisman was a graduate of Willamette University with degrees in political science, history, and education and psychology.

==Legacy==
From 1976 to 1985, conspiracy author Richard E. Sprague&#x27;s fringe book &quot;The Taking of America 1-2-3&quot; named Crisman as a grassy knoll shooter.

In 1977, controversial district attorney Jim Garrison claimed that Crisman was one of the &quot;Three Tramps&quot; arrested by Dallas police as well as being a Bishop of the Universal Life Church. Garrison theorized:
 &quot;I suggest the only reasonable conclusion is that he [Crisman] was (and probably is, if still around), an operative at a deep cover level in a long-range, clandestine, intelligence mission directly (in terms of our national intelligence paranoia) related to maintaining national security... Crisman emerges as an operative at a supervisory level ... acquired by the apparatus to carry out the menial jobs that are needed to push a current mission forward, a middle man—in the final analysis—between the mechanics who eliminate, and the handy men, who otherwise support a termination mission, on one hand, and the distant, far removed, deep submerged command level on the other.&quot;

In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had analyzed and compared the photographs of the &quot;three tramps&quot; with those of Crisman, as well as with photographs of Watergate figures E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and two other men. According to the Committee, only Crisman resembled any of the tramps; but the same Committee determined that he was not in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.

A document called &quot;The Easy Papers&quot; was circulated for decades among conspiracy researchers; The document, bearing the date September 13, 1969, purported to be a service record of Crisman&#x27;s time as an OSS and later CIA agent.

In 1997, influential conspiracy author Jim Marrs cited the document as proof that Crisman had been a member of the OSS during World War 2; Marrs was criticized for relying on the untrustworthy document. In 1999, conspiracy author Kenn Thomas&#x27;s book on the Maury Island incident carried the subtitle &quot;The Crisman Conspiracy&quot;. Conspiracy figure Michael Riconosciuto claims he knew Fred Crisman since Riconosciuto was a child.

===Animated comedy===
Fred Crisman: Cave of the Space Nazis is a 2022 animated comedy film based on the tales of Fred Crisman.
;Synopsis
The film begins with the disclaimer: &quot;The following events are &quot;apparently&quot; true, based on the many claims of Fred Lee Crisman. Technically, we can&#x27;t prove this didn&#x27;t happen.&quot;

The first scene sees Fred Crisman broadcasting from Tacoma radio station KAYE. Crisman tells listeners he was not involved with the Kennedy assassination, saying &quot;I could never have performed such a stunt...&quot;, before slyly adding &quot;alone&quot;. Crisman claims he has protected the Earth from aliens, saying to doubters &quot;If you don&#x27;t believe that I protected this world from egregious extraterrestrials, then I simply ask you: Where are they? I don&#x27;t see any aliens here. You&#x27;re welcome!&quot;

In flashback to 1946, the film introduces Raymond Palmer, the editor of Unbelievable Tales Magazine, as Crisman recounts an adventurous story of being shot down over the Bay of Bengal during the Second World War. Making his way to Cheduba Island, Crisman seeks shelter in a cave, where he discovers the dead bodies of soldiers. Venturing further into the cave, Crisman discovered the cave is inhabited by the Deros, evil monsters who believe themselves to be the true superior race of the Earth. When Crisman witnesses the Deros torture a victim, he pulls out a pistol, firing it while screaming &quot;Die, you Space Nazi Monsters!&quot;.

Crisman is wounded in the firefight, receiving a scar on his shoulder (Palmer notes that medical records indicate scar was present when Crisman first enlisted, but Crisman dismisses this as a Deros forgery). Killing many of the enemy, Crisman escapes and lives to tell the tale.

;Reception

Promotional material described the film emerging after &quot;a group of talented folks asked the question &#x27;Why hasn&#x27;t Fred Crisman had a movie yet?&#x27;&quot;

The film premiered on August 4, 2022, at Gen Con Film Festival, where it garnered the award for Best Comedy.
Director Bryan Shickley told reporters: &quot;I love the utter outrageousness that is Fred Lee Crisman, and no matter how you feel about his claims, you just can&#x27;t come away from spending time with Crisman without forming strong feelings about him.&quot;

The film was an official selection of the Brooklyn SciFi Film Festival.

<doc id="716550" wikidata="Q827546" url="?curid=716550" title="Breslow's depth">
<text>In medicine, Breslow&#x27;s depth was used as a prognostic factor in melanoma of the skin. It is a description of how deeply tumor cells have invaded. Currently, the standard Breslow&#x27;s depth has been replaced by the AJCC depth, in the AJCC staging system of melanoma. Originally, Breslow&#x27;s depth was divided into 5 stages.

==Classification==
==History==
Depth of invasion was first reported as a prognostic factor in melanoma by the pathologist Alexander Breslow, M.D. at George Washington University in 1970. In recognition of his contribution, the depth of invasion of melanoma is referred to by the eponym &quot;Breslow&#x27;s depth&quot;.

Subsequent studies confirmed and refined the role of depth of invasion in the prognosis of malignant melanoma. Currently, Breslow&#x27;s depth is included in the AJCC staging guidelines for melanoma as a major prognostic factor.

==Measurement==
Tumor depth is most accurately measured by evaluating the entire tumor via an excisional biopsy. Determination from specimens obtained using other biopsy techniques, such as a wedge or punch biopsy, are less accurate. Tumor depth cannot be calculated from a shave biopsy that only contains a portion of the tumor because it leads to an underestimation of its thickness.

Breslow&#x27;s depth is determined by using an ocular micrometer at a right angle to the skin to directly measure the depth to which tumor cells have invaded the skin. Breslow&#x27;s depth is measured from the granular layer of the epidermis down to the deepest point of invasion (sometimes involving detached nests of cells).

==Prognostic importance==

Tumor depth is one of the cornerstones of the current AJCC TNM staging of malignant melanoma. A large study validated the importance of tumor depth (but not Breslow&#x27;s original description) as one of the three most important prognostic factors in melanoma (the others being T stage and ulceration). Breslow&#x27;s depth also accurately predicted the risk for lymph node metastasis, with deeper tumors being more likely to involve the nodes.

The above studies showed that depth was a continuous variable correlating with prognosis. However, for staging purposes, the most recent AJCC guidelines use cutoffs of 1 mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm to divide patients into stages.

Clark&#x27;s level is a related staging system, used in conjunction with Breslow&#x27;s depth, which describes the level of anatomical invasion of the melanoma in the skin. Clark&#x27;s level was the primary factor in earlier AJCC staging schemas for melanoma. However, with further study, it has been shown that Clark&#x27;s level has a lower predictive value, is less reproducible, and is more operator-dependent as compared with Breslow&#x27;s depth. Thus, in the current (2010) AJCC staging system, Clark&#x27;s level has prognostic significance only in patients with very thin (Breslow depth &lt;1 mm) melanomas.

Five anatomical levels are recognized, and higher levels have worsening prognostic implications. These levels are:

*Level 1: Melanoma confined to the epidermis (melanoma in situ)
*Level 2: Invasion into the papillary dermis
*Level 3: Invasion to the junction of the papillary and reticular dermis
*Level 4: Invasion into the reticular dermis
*Level 5: Invasion into the subcutaneous fat

<text>Interstate 496 (I-496) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also a component of the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway 127 (US 127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.

Construction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. In the opinion of some, this neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.

==Route description==
I-496 starts at an interchange with I-96/I-69 at that freeway&#x27;s exit 95 in Delta Township in Eaton County. The freeway runs eastward through suburban areas of the township adjacent to some residential subdivisions. Continuing eastward, there is an interchange for Creyts Road before I-496 angles to the northeast. At the interchange with Waverly Road, I-496 crosses into Ingham County. The freeway then runs parallel to the Grand River. Near a partial interchange with Lansing Road (old US 27), the freeway gains a pair of service drives: St. Joseph Street runs one-way westbound on the north side, and Malcolm X Street runs eastbound to the south. The next interchange is for the connection to M-99, which runs along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. South of this interchange, M-99 connects to the Lansing Car Assembly plant, a former facility for Oldsmobile.
Continuing eastward, I-496 passes north of the assembly plant complex and south of the central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the , which is located on I-496&#x27;s southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the interchange to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96, Cedar and Larch streets) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by . I-496 runs parallel to the north side of the rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass. The freeway then crosses into East Lansing near the Red Cedar Natural Area.

After crossing the city line, I-496 turns southward and merges with US 127. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross a line of the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along the western edge of the campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US 127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US 127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson.
Like other state highways in Michigan, I-496 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 61,082 vehicles used the freeway between BL I-96 and the Trowbridge Road interchange south of US 127, the highest traffic count along I-496. West of Creyts Road, 17,600 vehicles did so each day, which was the lowest count along the trunkline. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-496 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads deemed important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

An east–west freeway was originally planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways&quot; (&quot;Yellow Book&quot;), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.

The section near downtown was to be built through a historically African-American neighborhood. The neighborhood was formed through &quot;unwritten rules of segregation&quot; as real estate agents and mortgage brokers guided black residents to the area when they were looking to buy homes. When the state and federal governments were planning the freeway, the area was chosen for the path of I-496. The neighborhood boasted a community center and several businesses that catered to the black population of Lansing, including the only record store that sold rhythm and blues music. Community leaders did not fight the freeway and instead lobbied for affordable housing and relocation assistance. The construction spurred integration of blacks into the wider community; some were able to move into neighborhoods previously closed to them, purchasing &quot;newer houses near better schools.&quot; In total, the construction of the freeway required the demolition or removal of nearly 600 homes, 60 businesses, and 15 farms.
The first section of I-496 was opened in December 1963, and ran from I-96 northerly to M-43/M-78 (Saginaw and Kalamazoo streets) between Lansing and East Lansing. The freeway, comprising the southern two-thirds, was designated I-496/M-78/BL I-96 while the northern portion was on city streets as M-78/BL I-96. Some 50 men completed the work by year&#x27;s end; they went entirely without vacation time to accomplish the feat. Another section of freeway was opened in 1966, and US 127 was rerouted to follow I-496/M-78. BL I-96 was removed from I-496/US 127/M-78 and routed along the former US 127. The freeway segment north of the Trowbridge Road interchange continuing northward as part of US 127 was opened in 1969. Another section opened at the same time was the western section from I-96 to Lansing Road (then US 27) in 1969. The remaining section between M-99 (then Logan Street, now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) and I-496/US 127 opened on December 18, 1970, completing construction.

The freeway underwent a $42.4 million reconstruction (equivalent to $ in ) between April and November 2001 which included the rehabilitation or reconstruction of 35 bridges, of freeway, and the addition of a weave-merge lane between Pennsylvania Avenue and US 127. Speed limits were raised along I-496 from in 2007 to reflect the speeds motorists were driving during studies conducted by MDOT and the Michigan State Police.
The name applied to the freeway was not without controversy. The Lansing City Council named it in September 1966 after Ralph W. Crego, a former city council member and the longest-serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history. The Historical Society of Greater Lansing wanted it named the &quot;R.E. Olds Expressway&quot;, in part because the new road brought about the demolition of the Olds Mansion, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and to &quot;recogniz[e] the contributions of R.E. Olds to the industries of the city.&quot; The society approached the Michigan Legislature, which introduced House Resolution 48 in February 1970 using the historical society&#x27;s preferred name. The city council realized that they had been bypassed and conveniently discovered that their original resolution was not &quot;formally adopted&quot;. They named a park for Crego instead in October 1970 and adopted a resolution to name I-496 the &quot;Oldsmobile Expressway&quot;. The Legislature approved its resolution resulting in two names, one for the founder of the car company, and one for the company itself. The council member who introduced the city&#x27;s resolution criticized the Legislature for taking action without consultation. The state resolution was intercepted before it could be sent to the Michigan Department of State Highways, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970, with the &quot;Oldsmobile Expressway&quot; name. On August 21, 1972, during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Oldsmobile, Senate Concurrent Resolution 345 renamed I-496 the &quot;R.E. Olds Freeway&quot;.

==Future==
The portion of I-496 shared with US 127 is being renovated throughout 2024 and 2025 as a part of the US 127 Corridor Project. The work will widen the highway to three lanes in each direction, reconfigure interchanges, improve bridges, and upgrade lighting conditions, among other changes. As of December 2024, construction on the northbound stretch of I-496/US 127 is complete outside of the Trowbridge Road interchange, and improvements to the southbound stretch are slated to begin in early 2025.

In January 2025, the city of Lansing was awarded a $1 million federal grant to develop a plan to cap portions of I-496. According to city officials, the current plan is to cap the portion of I-496 between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Walnut Street. The grant does not cover construction costs.

==Related trunkline==
The Capitol Loop was a state trunkline highway running through Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It formed a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it had unique reassurance markers—the signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It was known internally at MDOT as Connector 496 for inventory purposes. The highway followed a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop were under state maintenance and jurisdiction.

The loop was originally proposed in 1986 as part of a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding the streets as part of a downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop.

The length of the Capitol Loop that ran independent of BL I-96 was transferred to the City of Lansing on March 26, 2024. The city has been converting streets from one-way traffic to two-way since 2022, including plans to convert Ottawa and Allegan streets during 2024. With the transfer, the Capitol Loop designation was removed from the state highway system.

<text>RRDtool (&quot;round-robin database tool&quot;) aims to handle time series data such as network bandwidth, temperatures or CPU load. The data is stored in a circular buffer based database, thus the system storage footprint remains constant over time.

It also includes tools to extract round-robin data in a graphical format, for which it was originally intended.
Bindings exist for several programming languages, e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, PHP and Lua. There is an independent full Java implementation called rrd4j.

==General data storage==
RRDtool assumes time-variable data in intervals of a certain length. This interval, usually named step, is specified upon creation of an RRD file and cannot be changed afterwards. Because data may not always be available at just the right time, RRDtool will automatically interpolate any submitted data to fit its internal time-steps.

The value for a specific step, that has been interpolated, is named a primary data point (PDP). Multiple PDPs may be consolidated according to a consolidation function (CF) to form a consolidated data point (CDP). Typical consolidation functions are average, minimum, maximum.

After the data has been consolidated, the resulting CDP is stored in a round-robin archive (RRA). A round-robin archive stores a fixed number of CDPs and specifies how many PDPs should be consolidated into one CDP and which CF to use. The total time covered by an RRA can be calculated as follows:

: time covered = (#CDPs stored) × (#PDPs per CDP) × (step time length)

After this time the archive will &quot;wrap around&quot;: the next insertion will overwrite the oldest entry. This behavior in this context is referred to as &quot;round-robin&quot; and is the reason for the program&#x27;s name. However this is different from the common computer science definition, which is a method of distributing resources among multiple consumers or processes.

To cover several timespans and/or use several consolidation functions, an RRD file may contain multiple RRAs. The data retrieval function of RRDtool automatically selects the archive with the highest resolution that still covers the requested timespan. This mechanism is also used by RRDtool&#x27;s graphing subsystem.

<text>Michael James Riconosciuto (born 1947 or 1948) is an American electronics and computer expert who was arrested in early 1991, shortly after providing Inslaw, Inc. with an affidavit in support of their lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice.
Riconosciuto professed a defense centered on the Inslaw Affair (a legal case in which the U.S. government was charged with illegal use of computer software). Riconosciuto claimed to have reprogrammed Inslaw&#x27;s case-management program (PROMIS) with a secret &quot;back-door&quot;
to allow clandestine tracking of individuals. Riconosciuto stated that he had been threatened with prosecution by a Justice Department official. Riconosciuto provided an affidavit detailing threats to a House Select Committee investigating the Inslaw Affair.

==Early life==
Riconosciuto was born to Marshall and Twylla Riconosciuto and raised in Tacoma, Washington. He had a brother named Joseph who was approximately four years younger than him.

Riconosciuto was recognized for some technical and scientific talents early in his life. Riconosciuto claims he knew conspiracy-theory figure Fred Crisman as a child. When he was only twelve years old, &quot;The Tacoma News Tribune and Ledger&quot; called him a &quot;modern Da Vinci&quot; in a 1960 article describing a phone network he established for himself and thirteen friends in Tacoma, experiments he conducted with underwater microphones and plant cognition, an intercom system he developed in his home and a radio class he helped teach at a local YMCA. By the summer of 1964, before his junior year of high school, Riconosciuto built and lived in an underwater house complete with television, radio, &quot;and other common necessities.&quot; He also set up the stereo sound system in Bellarmine Preparatory School&#x27;s auditorium. As a teenager, he constructed a working argon laser, a feat that earned him an invitation to Stanford University as a research assistant. His work on underwater acoustics and his laser drew the attention of the United States Department of the Navy which offered him several college scholarships before he had even successfully demonstrated his laser.

Riconosciuto was employed as an engineer at a mine in Maricopa, California. Hercules Properties, Ltd. had raised financing and purchased a contaminated waste-disposal site which had once been a portion of a TNT and fertilizer manufacturer known as Hercules Powder Works.

==Allegations==
===Cabazon murders===
Nathan Baca&#x27;s Emmy winning series &quot;The Octopus Murders&quot; featured documents from the archives of Michael Riconosciuto. These documents have been the subject of interest for recently reopened cold case homicide investigations.

===Inslaw Affair===
In early 1991, Riconosciuto filed an affidavit before a House judiciary committee investigating the bankruptcy case of Inslaw Inc. v. United States Government. Riconosciuto was called to testify before Congress regarding the modification of PROMIS, a case-management software program developed for the Department of Justice by Washington, D.C.–based Inslaw Inc. Riconosciuto declared he had been under the direction of Earl Brian, who was then a controlling shareholder and director of Hadron, Inc. He claimed Brian, an associate of Ronald Reagan, was involved in a secret agreement with the Iranian government to delay the release of Americans held hostage in Iran until after the 1980 United States presidential election, and the PROMIS software was stolen in order to raise funds for Brian&#x27;s payment.

Within eight days of this declaration, Riconosciuto was arrested for conspiracy to manufacture, conspiracy to distribute, possession with intent to distribute, and with distribution—a total of ten counts related to methamphetamine and methadone.

During his trial, Riconosciuto accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of stealing two copies of his tape. Riconosciuto also claimed he himself had disposed of a third tape.

In addition to his claims of a government &quot;frame up&quot; related to Inslaw, Riconosciuto maintained the chemical laboratory on his property was in use for the extraction of precious metals such as platinum in a highly specialized mining operation.

No drug-lab contamination was found at the laboratory site and a member of the DOE&#x27;s Hazardous Spill Response Team asserted that high barium levels on the property were unlikely to be the result of Riconosciuto&#x27;s work. Barium does have specialized usage for metallurgy with regards to the processing of platinum group metals.

In his investigation of the allegations surrounding the Inslaw case, Special Counsel Nicholas J. Bua was particularly critical of several of Inslaw&#x27;s witnesses. Bua found Riconosciuto had given inconsistent accounts in statements to the Hamiltons, his affidavit, and in testimony at his 1992 trial for manufacturing methamphetamine. Bua compared Riconosciuto&#x27;s story about Promis to &quot;a historical novel; a tale of total fiction woven against the background of accurate historical facts.&quot;

== Depiction in media ==
He appears in the &quot;American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders&quot;, a documentary series on The Octopus Conspiracy.

<doc id="716596" wikidata="Q414815" url="?curid=716596" title="Denatonium">
<text>Denatonium, usually available as denatonium benzoate (under trade names such as Denatrol, BITTERANT-b, BITTER+PLUS, Bitrex, Bitrix, and Aversion) and as denatonium saccharinate (BITTERANT-s), is the most bitter chemical compound known, with bitterness thresholds of 0.05 ppm for the benzoate and 0.01 ppm for the saccharinate. 
It was discovered in 1958 during research on local anesthetics by T. &amp; H. Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark Bitrex.

Dilutions of as little as 10 ppm are unbearably bitter to most humans. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids, but are often traded as solutions. They are used as aversive agents (bitterants) to prevent inappropriate ingestion. Denatonium is used in denatured alcohol, antifreeze, preventive nail biting preparations, respirator mask fit-testing, animal repellents, liquid soaps, shampoos, and Nintendo Switch game cards to prevent accidental swallowing or choking by children. It is not known to pose any long-term health risks.

The name &quot;denatonium&quot; reflects the substance&#x27;s primary use as a denaturant and its chemical nature as a cation, hence &quot;-onium&quot; as a Neo-Latin suffix.

== Structure, synthesis, and physical properties ==

Denatonium is a quaternary ammonium cation. It is composed as a salt with any of several anions, such as benzoate or saccharinate. It can be obtained by the quaternization of lidocaine, a popular anesthetic, with benzyl chloride or a similar reagent. To obtain other salts, like the benzoate, the formed denatonium chloride is subjected to an anion exchange reaction with sodium benzoate, or first sodium hydroxide to make denatonium hydroxide followed by neutralization with benzoic acid. Other similar compounds are procaine and benzocaine.

== Biochemistry ==

Denatonium in humans is recognized by eight distinct bitter taste receptors: TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R10, TAS2R39, TAS2R43, TAS2R16, TAS2R46, and TAS2R47, being by far to the compound.

Denatonium can act as a bronchodilator by activating bitter taste receptors in the airway smooth muscle.

== Applications ==
The bitterness of the compound guides most applications of denatonium. Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. One designation in particular, SD-40B, indicates that ethanol has been denatured using denatonium benzoate.

Denatonium is commonly included in placebos used in clinical trials to mimic the bitter taste of certain medications. 

Denatonium benzoate is an ingredient in certain nail polishes and varnishes designed to discourage nail biting, as the bitter denatonium serves as an aversive.

Denatonium also discourages consumption of poisonous alcohols such as methanol and additives such as ethylene glycol. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids, including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors.

In 1995, the U.S. state of Oregon required that denatonium benzoate be added to products containing sweet-tasting ethylene glycol and methanol such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid to prevent poisonings of children and animals. In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide.

Animals are known to have different sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard rat poisons from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents.

Nintendo Switch game cartridges are coated in denatonium benzoate to prevent young children from consuming them.

Lithium button cells, which can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed, are sometimes coated with denatonium benzoate to discourage small children from swallowing them.

<text>The Tagea Brandts &quot;Rejselegat&quot; (Travel Scholarship) is a Danish award to women who have made a significant contribution in science, literature or art. The grant, which is given without application, was created and endowed by Danish industrialist Vilhelm Brandt (1854–1921) in 1905 in honor of his wife, Tagea Brandt.
It is awarded annually on 17 March, her birthday.
The charter of 1922 provides that it shall be given to outstanding women in science, art, music, literature and theater arts (particularly in this case to actresses at the Royal Danish Theatre). The intent is for the awardee to both broaden her horizons while promoting Danish society abroad, and to benefit from vacation and rest time.

The first scholarships were given in 1924; the first time the amount was DKK 10.000, in 1958 it was increased to DKK 15.000, in 1967 to 25.000, later to 50,000, and currently it is DKK 75.000, which usually is given to 2-3 women annually.

<text>Carl Ludwig Siegel (31 December 1896 – 4 April 1981) was a German mathematician specialising in analytic number theory. He is known for, amongst other things, his contributions to the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem in Diophantine approximation, Siegel&#x27;s method, Siegel&#x27;s lemma and the Siegel mass formula for quadratic forms. He has been named one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century.

André Weil, without hesitation, named Siegel as the greatest mathematician of the first half of the 20th century. Atle Selberg said of Siegel and his work:

==Biography==
Siegel was born in Berlin, where he enrolled at the Humboldt University in Berlin in 1915 as a student in mathematics, astronomy, and physics. Amongst his teachers were Max Planck and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, whose influence made the young Siegel abandon astronomy and turn towards number theory instead. His best-known student was Jürgen Moser, one of the founders of KAM theory (Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser), which lies at the foundations of chaos theory. Other notable students were Kurt Mahler, the number theorist, and Hel Braun who became one of the few female full professors in mathematics in Germany.

Siegel was an antimilitarist, and in 1917, during World War I he was committed to a psychiatric institute as a conscientious objector. According to his own words, he withstood the experience only because of his support from Edmund Landau, whose father had a clinic in the neighborhood. After the end of World War I, he enrolled at the University of Göttingen, studying under Landau, who was his doctoral thesis supervisor (PhD in 1920). He stayed in Göttingen as a teaching and research assistant; many of his groundbreaking results were published during this period. In 1922, he was appointed professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt as the successor of Arthur Moritz Schönflies. Siegel, who was deeply opposed to Nazism, was a close friend of the docents Ernst Hellinger and Max Dehn and used his influence to help them. This attitude prevented Siegel&#x27;s appointment as a successor to the chair of Constantin Carathéodory in Munich. In Frankfurt he took part with Dehn, Hellinger, Paul Epstein, and others in a seminar on the history of mathematics, which was conducted at the highest level. In the seminar they read only original sources. Siegel&#x27;s reminiscences about the time before World War II are in an essay in his collected works.

In 1936 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Oslo. In 1938, he returned to Göttingen before emigrating in 1940 via Norway to the United States, where he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had already spent a sabbatical in 1935. He returned to Göttingen after World War II, when he accepted a post as professor in 1951, which he kept until his retirement in 1959. In 1968 he was elected a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

==Career==
Siegel&#x27;s work on number theory, diophantine equations, and celestial mechanics in particular won him numerous honours. In 1978, he was awarded the first Wolf Prize in Mathematics, one of the most prestigious in the field. When the prize committee decided to select the greatest living mathematician, the discussion centered around Siegel and Israel Gelfand as the leading candidates. The prize was ultimately split between them.

Siegel&#x27;s work spans analytic number theory; and his theorem on the finiteness of the integer points of curves, for genus &gt; 1, is historically important as a major general result on diophantine equations, when the field was essentially undeveloped. He worked on L-functions, discovering the (presumed illusory) Siegel zero phenomenon. His work, derived from the Hardy–Littlewood circle method on quadratic forms, appeared in the later, adele group theories encompassing the use of theta-functions. The Siegel modular varieties, which describe Siegel modular forms, are recognised as part of the moduli theory of abelian varieties. In all this work the structural implications of analytic methods show through.

In the early 1970s Weil gave a series of seminars on the history of number theory prior to the 20th century and he remarked that Siegel once told him that when the first person discovered the simplest case of Faulhaber&#x27;s formula then, in Siegel&#x27;s words, &quot;Es gefiel dem lieben Gott.&quot; (It pleased the dear Lord.) Siegel was a profound student of the history of mathematics and put his studies to good use in such works as the Riemann–Siegel formula, which Siegel found while reading through Riemann&#x27;s unpublished papers.

<text>&quot;Burning Love&quot; is a 1972 song by Elvis Presley, written by Dennis Linde, originally released by Arthur Alexander earlier in 1972. Presley found major success with the song, it becoming his final Top 10 hit in the American Hot 100 or pop charts, peaking at number 2 (it was kept out of the top spot by Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;).

==Elvis Presley version==
Elvis Presley&#x27;s version was released as a single on August 1, 1972, with the B-side &quot;It&#x27;s a Matter of Time&quot;, and it reached number 36 in the country charts. Elvis had recorded it at RCA&#x27;s Hollywood studios on March 28, 1972. It was his last big hit. The electric guitar opening and riffs were overdubbed and played by Dennis Linde himself.

For the week of October 28, 1972, &quot;Burning Love&quot; rose to number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s rival &quot;Cashbox&quot;&#x27;s pop charts during the week of November 11, 1972. The song was Elvis&#x27;s 40th and final Top Ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US charts. 

He performed it in at least two high-profile productions: the concert film &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot; (during which he had to use a lyric sheet as the song was still new to him), and the later &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot; concert. Despite its popularity among his fans, he rarely performed the song live, the exception being in 1975 when it was included in his setlist during the majority of the year’s performances, both in Las Vegas and on the road.

The song was also released on an album titled &quot;Burning Love and Hits from His Movies, Volume 2&quot; on November 1, 1972. Despite this album&#x27;s subtitle, the only actual hit on the album was the title song.

A new backing track for the song was recorded in 1980, intended for the &quot;Guitar Man&quot; album. It went unreleased until 2000. In 2015, a new orchestral arrangement for the song was recorded accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and was released on album &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;.

==Uses==

* The song was recorded for the 1979 television movie &quot;Elvis&quot;, starring Kurt Russell and Ronnie McDowell as the singing voice of Elvis. The song was not released for a soundtrack.

* Wynonna Judd&#x27;s version of &quot;Burning Love&quot; is the closing song of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002). The song itself would later play a role in an episode of &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, with main character Lilo Pelekai naming a hummingbird-like love-inducing experiment, &quot;Hunkahunka&quot;.

* The song was used during the Miss Universe 2010 swimsuit competition, where Ximena Navarrete from Mexico won the title.

* A remix was made for the Cirque du Soleil show &quot;Viva Elvis&quot;, which began in 2010, and found on its soundtrack. During the live show, it is played during a montage of Elvis&#x27;s best love scenes on the rear-projection screen, while the band has a spotlight. This remix puts more emphasis on drums and guitars, with a sound similar to The Who.

* The song was used in the 2011 video game &quot;Homefront&quot; in the mission &quot;Night Raid&quot; where members of the American Resistance launch white phosphorus on soldiers of the Korean People&#x27;s Army.

* The song is one of six possible soundtracks on the Disney California Adventure attraction &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!&quot;, which opened in 2017.

* &quot;Burning Love&quot; was used as a wake-up song on the space shuttle mission STS-123.

* The song was frequently used by comedian Conan O&#x27;Brien to warm up his audience prior to taping his talk show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, with the host singing the lyrics with musical accompaniment by the house band.

* Various films and television series have included performances of and references to the song, including &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (1988), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (2001), &quot;The Game Plan&quot;, &quot;Crazy Love&quot; (2007), &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; (2009), &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, &quot;New Girl&quot;, &quot;The Mistle-Tones&quot; (2012), &quot;&quot; (2014), &quot;Fuller House&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;The Boogeyman&quot; (2023) and &quot;Agent Elvis&quot; (2023).

* Presley&#x27;s recording was used in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 2022 Presley biopic &quot;Elvis&quot;, and is featured on its soundtrack.

<doc id="716605" wikidata="Q7600119" url="?curid=716605" title="Stannary law">
<text>Stannary law (derived from the for tin) is the body of English law that governs tin mining in Cornwall and Devon; although no longer of much practical relevance, the stannary law remains part of the law of the United Kingdom and is arguably the oldest law incorporated into the English legal system.

The stannary law&#x27;s complexity and comprehensive reach into the lives of tin miners necessitated the existence of the legislative Stannary Convocations of Devon and Cornwall, the judicial Courts of the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, and the executive Lord Warden of the Stannaries. The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages. Special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in Britain, and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in Cornwall and Devon from any jurisdiction other than the stannary courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances.

== Stannary Convocation of Devon ==
Edward I&#x27;s 1305 Stannary Charter established Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford as Devon&#x27;s stannaries, with a monopoly on all tin mining in Devon, a right to representation in the Stannary Parliament and a right to the jurisdiction of the stannary courts. Plympton became the fourth Devon stannary town in 1307.

The parliament consisted of ninety-six jurates, with twenty-four being chosen by each of the four Devon stannaries. The jurates were chosen at special courts held in each stannary by &quot;tinners&quot;: a term broad enough to include not just miners and tin work owners, but others concerned with the tin industry. The Parliament usually met in an open air forum at Crockern Tor. The last convocation of the Devon Parliament was in 1786, but as late as the 1980s, an honorary stannator would be named whenever a new tin mine was opened.

== Cornish Stannary Parliament ==
A charter of King John had given the tin miners of Cornwall certain legal rights which were confirmed by King Edward I in 1305. They had the rights of &quot;bounding&quot; (prospecting for and working tin ore deposits), of trial before their own stannary court, and of exemption from ordinary taxation. The stannaries were: Foweymore (district of Bodmin Moor), Blackmore (district of St Austell); Tywarnhayle (district of St Agnes and Carn Brea); and Kerrier and Penwith (district between Godolphin and Land&#x27;s End). The courts were normally held every three weeks and presided over by the steward who had been appointed by the warden of the stannaries. As there are no extant records before the 16th century the court procedure is unknown; if tinners were compelled to appear before another court they could insist that half the jury be tinners.

The privileges of the stannaries of Cornwall were confirmed by Edward III on the creation of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1337. This confirmed that the tin miners were exempt from all civil jurisdiction other than that of the Stannary Courts, except in cases affecting land, life or limb. There was at this period no definition of the districts of each stannary.

The Cornish stannaries were suspended in 1496, the year before the Cornish Rebellion of 1497. Henry VII restored them in return for a payment from the tin miners of the sum, enormous at the time, of £1,000, to support his war on Scotland. In addition to restoring the stannaries and pardoning the people who participated in the rebellion, Henry&#x27;s Charter of Pardon, 1508 provided that no new laws affecting miners should be enacted without the consent of 24 stannators, six being chosen from each of the four stannaries:
*Foymore (or Foweymore): chosen by the mayor and corporation of Lostwithiel
*Blackmore: by the mayor and corporation of Launceston
*Tywarnhaile (or Tynwarnhail): by the mayor and corporation of Truro
*Penwith and Kerrier: by the mayor and corporation of Helston

The stannators were described in 1831 as being &quot;some of the principal gentlemen of the mining district&quot;. On assembly the stannators elected a speaker, the meeting being termed a Stannary Parliament. The parliaments were convened occasionally by the Lord Warden of the Stannaries when it was felt that laws concerning the miner&#x27;s rights needed to be made or revised.

The Cornish Stannary Parliament last assembled at Truro in 1752, and continued until 11 September 1753. In 1977, responding by letter to a written question in the House of Commons from Plaid Cymru MP Dafydd Wigley to the Attorney-General for England and Wales, Lord Chancellor Lord Elwyn-Jones said he could find no record of the charter having been formally amended or withdrawn but also noted academic opinion that &quot;no doubt has ever been expressed about Parliament&#x27;s power to enact legislation for the stannaries without the need to obtain the consent of Convocation&quot;.

In March 2007, Bridget Prentice, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice, stated in a Commons written answer that &quot;there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence&quot; and that there &quot;are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only&quot;.

==Stannary courts==

The Devon stannary courts met in Lydford and operated a prison there, while the Cornish stannary courts met primarily in Truro. The Devon and Cornwall stannary courts were merged into a single Stannaries Court following the Stannaries Act 1855, but their powers were later transferred to county authorities by the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896.

The relations between the stannaries and Westminster were discussed in &quot;Strode&#x27;s Case&quot; (1512).

== Mining courts and customs in other counties ==

While the stannaries of Cornwall and Devon had the most developed legal systems, a number of other mining communities had similar privileges. The customs of the community were usually confirmed by charter, with the miners having the right to seek for minerals in all areas other than tilled fields, subject to paying taxes to the Crown.

Examples included:
*Gloucestershire: The Free Miners of coal and iron of the Forest of Dean had their customs confirmed by charter attributed to Edward I, with a miner&#x27;s court to try cases between the miners, and a miner&#x27;s parliament.
*Derbyshire: The hundreds of High Peak and Wirksworth (an area known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Field&quot;) were divided into eight &quot;liberties&quot; for the purposes of lead mining, and disputes were heard in the barmote courts.
*Somerset: The customs of the lead-mining district of the Mendip Hills were encoded under Edward IV. Two courts, consisting of twelve miners, were held annually to enforce the code.
*Cumberland: The lead miners of Alston Moor enjoyed legal privileges from the thirteenth century. By the reign of Henry V there was in existence a court of mines, and the miners elected a coroner and bailiff, with the king&#x27;s officers having no authority to serve writs in the area.

== Present day ==

Some Cornish political activists claim to have revived the Stannary Parliament since 1974, along with the right to veto British legislation. Indeed, it purports to have actually vetoed acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although it has been unable to enforce this.

On 12 December 1974 the Home Office replied to letters from the members of this revived parliament, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. However, the stannaries were not abolished, and the Home Office has made no effort to hold these elections. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament is driven primarily by Cornish nationalism and demands for greater local autonomy, along with arguments about the constitutional status of Cornwall.
