<text>was a Japanese violinist, philosopher, composer, and educator and the founder of the international Suzuki method of music education and developed a philosophy for educating people of all ages and abilities. An influential pedagogue in music education of children, he often spoke of the ability of all children to learn things well, especially in the right environment, and of developing the heart and building the character of music students through their music education. Before his time, it was rare for children to be formally taught classical instruments from an early age and even more rare for children to be accepted by a music teacher without an audition or entrance examination. Not only did he endeavor to teach children the violin from early childhood and then infancy, his school in Matsumoto did not screen applicants for their ability upon entrance. Suzuki was also responsible for the early training of some of the earliest Japanese violinists to be successfully appointed to prominent western classical music organizations. During his lifetime, he received several honorary doctorates in music including from the New England Conservatory of Music (1956), and the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, was proclaimed a Living National Treasure of Japan, and in 1993, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Biography==
Shinichi Suzuki was born on October 17, 1898, in Nagoya, Japan, as one of twelve children. His father, Masakichi Suzuki, was originally a maker of traditional Japanese string instruments but in 1880, he became interested in violins and by Shinichi&#x27;s birth he had developed the first Japanese violin factory (now Suzuki Violin Co., Ltd.), at that time the largest such factory in the world. Suzuki spent his childhood working at his father&#x27;s violin factory putting up violin soundposts. A family friend encouraged Shinichi to study Western culture, but his father felt it was beneath Suzuki to be a performer. In 1916, at the age of 17, Suzuki began to teach himself to play the violin after being inspired by a recording of Franz Schubert’s Ave Maria, performed by the violinist Mischa Elman. Without access to professional instruction, he listened to recordings and tried to imitate what he heard. It was not until a few years later, at the age of twenty-one, that Suzuki moved to Tokyo and began taking violin lessons from Ko Ando, a former student of Joseph Joachim.

When Suzuki was 22 years old, his friend Marquis Tokugawa persuaded Suzuki&#x27;s father to let him go to Berlin, where Suzuki studied for eight years under Karl Klingler, another former student of Joachim, with the first four years focusing on études and concertos and the last four years focusing on chamber music. Suzuki also claimed to have spent time there under the tutelage of Albert Einstein, who was an amateur violinist. Several of Suzuki&#x27;s credentials, such as educational background and endorsements, have been under scrutiny. For example, official school records were found that indicate that Suzuki, playing Handel&#x27;s Violin sonata in D major, failed his conservatory auditions for Karl Klingler. However, Klingler’s daughter, Marianne Klingler, has said that Suzuki had indeed studied with her father, who did not normally extend his activities to private teaching and thus, Suzuki was Klingler’s only private student. While in Germany, he met and married Waltraud Prange (1905–2000).

On returning to Japan, he formed a string quartet with his brothers and began teaching violin at the Imperial School of Music and at the Kunitachi Music School in Tokyo, and started taking an interest in developing the music education of young students in violin.

During World War II, his father&#x27;s violin factory was converted into a factory to construct seaplane floats. It was bombed by American warplanes; killing one of Suzuki&#x27;s brothers. Suzuki and his wife eventually evacuated to separate locations when conditions became too unsafe for her as an ex-German citizen, and the factory was struggling to operate due to a shortage of wood. Suzuki left with other family members for a mountainous region to secure wood from a geta factory, and his wife moved to a &quot;German village&quot; where Germans and ex-Germans were sequestered.

Once the war was over, Suzuki was invited to teach at a new music school, and agreed on condition that he be allowed to develop the teaching of music to children from infancy and early childhood. He adopted into his family, and continued the music education of, one of his prewar students, Koji, on learning that Koji had been orphaned. Suzuki and his wife eventually reunited and moved to Matsumoto, where he continued to teach.

He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.

Suzuki died at his home in Matsumoto, Japan, on 26 January 1998, aged 99.

==Contributions to pedagogy==
Suzuki&#x27;s experiences as an adult beginner and the philosophies that he held during his life were recapitulated in the lessons he developed to teach his students. Schools of early childhood education have combined his philosophies and approaches with pedagogues such as Carl Orff, Zoltán Kodály, Maria Montessori, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, and Glenn Doman.

Evelyn Hermann believes that the Suzuki method &quot;can be a philosophy for living. He is not trying to create the world of violinists. His major aim is to open a world of beauty to young children everywhere that they might have greater enjoyment in their lives through the God-given sounds of music.&quot;

Suzuki developed his ideas through a strong belief in the ideas of &quot;Talent Education&quot;, a philosophy of instruction that is based on the premise that talent, musical or otherwise, is something that can be developed in any child. At the 1958 National Festival, Suzuki said,
Suzuki also collaborated with other thinkers of his time, like Glenn Doman, founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, an organization that studies neurological development in young children. Suzuki and Doman agreed on the premise that all young children had great potential, and Suzuki interviewed Doman for his book &quot;Where Love is Deep&quot;.

Suzuki employed the following ideas of Talent Education in his music pedagogy schools:
#The human being is a product of his environment.
#The earlier, the better – with not only music, but all learning.
#Repetition of experiences is important for learning.
#Teachers and parents (adult human environment) must be at a high level and continue to grow to provide a better learning situation for the child.
#The system or method must involve illustrations for the child based on the teacher&#x27;s understanding of when, what, and how (Kendall, 1966).

The epistemological learning aspect, or, as Suzuki called it, the &quot;mother tongue&quot; philosophy, is that in which children learn through their own observation of their environment, especially in the learning of their first language. The worldwide Suzuki movement continues to use the theories that Suzuki himself put forward in the mid-1940s and has been continuously developed to this day, stemming from his encouragement of others to continue to develop and research the education of children throughout his lifetime.

He trained other teachers, who returned to their respective countries and helped to develop the Suzuki method and philosophy internationally.

==Suzuki philosophy==
Suzuki Talent Education or the Suzuki Method combines a music teaching method with a philosophy that embraces the total development of the child. Suzuki&#x27;s guiding principle was &quot;character first, ability second&quot;, and that any child can learn.

<text>Norton is a small village and former civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, one of the three original villages which were absorbed into Letchworth Garden City, the other two being Willian and Old Letchworth. The village is known to have existed by 1007, with remains of the medieval settlement visible as earthworks in a field beside the church. However, the history of the village goes back even further than that. 

==History of Norton==
Archaeological excavations in Norton have revealed evidence of human activity in the area going back to before around 3000 BC. People lived at different sites in the village during the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age, with continuity into the Roman period. Anglo-Saxon occupation is evident from a small cemetery discovered at Blackhorse Road in 1957 and a settlement discovered at Kristiansand Way in 1989, thought to be the lost site of &quot;Rodenhanger&quot;. It was during this latter period that the first written evidence about Norton appeared. A charter relating to Norton dating from AD 1007 is the earliest document to survive, recording its donation to the Abbey of St Albans and claiming that it had originally been given by Offa, King of Mercia, in the eighth century, together with &quot;Rodenhanger&quot;, a lost site said to &quot;lie together with&quot; Norton. The manor appeared in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, when it was listed among the lands belonging to the Abbots of St Albans. The records of the manorial courts, which date from AD 1244, give an extensive overview of the life of Norton&#x27;s villagers during the medieval period. Following the Dissolution of St Albans Abbey in 1539 the manor of Norton passed into private hands, but its manorial courts continued to record the activities of its villagers until 1916.

The village church, the Church of St Nicholas, dating back to the early twelfth century, is dedicated to St Nicholas, and has eight light bells hung for change ringing. Since the construction in the same parish of the much larger St George&#x27;s church, in the town, St Nicholas&#x27; is in use as a chapel of ease.

==Governance==
Norton was an ancient parish in the hundred of Cashio.

The parish of Norton was included in the Hitchin Poor Law Union from 1835. The south-eastern part of the parish of Norton extended to the edge of the town of Baldock, and in 1880 the Baldock Local Board was given control of the parts of Norton parish where the town&#x27;s urban area was starting to expand into Norton. The following year the parish boundary between Norton and Baldock was adjusted to match the local board boundary.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish of Norton became part of the Hitchin Rural District. Following the commencement of work on Letchworth Garden City in 1903, it became necessary to review administrative arrangements in the area. The civil parish of Letchworth was substantially enlarged on 1 April 1908 to take over all of Norton parish, which was abolished, and the northern part of Willian parish. At the date of the 1901 national census, the last prior to the parish&#x27;s abolishment, Norton had a population of 169. Since 1 April 1908, Norton has been administered as part of Letchworth, which became an urban district in 1919, and part of North Hertfordshire in 1974.

==&#x27;Gypsy&#x27; Smith==

Polly and Cornelius Smith, the parents of Rodney &quot;Gypsy&quot; Smith, the international evangelist, are buried in the churchyard at Norton, Polly having died from smallpox in 1865 while the family was passing through the parish. Cornelius Smith was also a well-known evangelist, often preaching the Gospel with his two brothers. &#x27;Gypsy&#x27; Smith maintained contact with Norton, visiting his parents grave as often as he could. In 1934, the Letchworth Methodist Circuit decided that a new church was needed in Norton Village. It was thought appropriate to dedicate the new building in memory of &#x27;Gypsy&#x27; Smith&#x27;s parents, and Smith raised a large sum of money for the building himself, with donations being sent from the UK and the United States.

The new chapel was opened by Smith&#x27;s daughter Zillah and her husband Mr J T Lean in 1934 as &quot;Norton Methodist Mission&quot;, and it was given a distinctive caravan-shaped pulpit. Later, &#x27;Gypsy&#x27; Smith and his brother Ezekiel conducted evangelical meetings at the church, one of the rare occasions when the two brothers appeared on the same platform. The building is still in use today as the &quot;North Avenue Methodist Church&quot;.

==Schools==
The village&#x27;s primary school, named after the church, was founded in 1873. A nearby secondary school, Norton School, founded in 1906, served the village and the area around it but was closed in 2002 with the school and its playing fields being developed for housing.

<doc id="707096" wikidata="Q3430145" url="?curid=707096" title="&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer">
<text>&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer is an erotic comic strip and later comic book created by artist Reed Waller and writer Kate Worley. Set in fictional Mipple City, Minnesota (derived from &quot;MPLS&quot;, the old postal abbreviation for Minneapolis) in a universe populated by anthropomorphic animal characters, the strip is a soap opera focusing on Omaha, a feline exotic dancer, and her lover, Chuck, the son of a business tycoon.

The strip debuted in the funny animal magazine &quot;Vootie&quot;, and it was subsequently published in a number of underground comix in the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; became the subject of the eponymous comic book series published from 1984 to 1993 by Kitchen Sink Press; it was relaunched by Fantagraphics Books through 1995. The final chapters of the strip&#x27;s storyline were published in &quot;Sizzle&quot; magazine, beginning in 2006.

&quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; was the first of several comic books published in the early 1980s which integrated explicit sex into their storylines, rather than using sex for shock value. The comic was the subject of a number of obscenity controversies, and it was nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 1989 and 1991.

==Publication history==
In 1976, Reed Waller founded &quot;Vootie&quot;, a fanzine intended to promote funny animal comics. He began developing the concept for &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; after one of the magazine&#x27;s contributors said that there was not enough sex in the genre. Inspired by Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, Waller began looking for a theme for his new comic. He visited local strip clubs in St. Paul with his sketchbook, and read newspaper articles about attempts to shut the bars down. Another contributor to the magazine, Jim Schumeister, proposed a comic called &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Bimbos&quot;, in which &quot;a bevy of strippers champion liberty in the face of Puritan oppression&quot;. This proposal sparked the idea for &quot;Omaha&quot;.

The character debuted in &quot;The Adventures of Omaha&quot;, which was published in &quot;Vootie&quot; in 1978. The first chapter of &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; was published by Kitchen Sink Press in &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot; No. 9 in 1981. A five-page untitled story appeared in &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot; No. 10 in 1982, as a followup to the first chapter. In 1983, a one-page parody strip starring Omaha, titled &quot;Hotsizz Twonkies&quot; (a parody ad of HostessTwinkies), was published in &quot;E-Man&quot; No. 5 by First Comics. Another five-page untitled story, identified as &quot;Shelly and Omaha&quot; in &quot;The Collected Omaha Volume 1&quot;, appeared in &quot;Dope Comix&quot; #5; it was reprinted in &quot;Bizarre Sex Series&quot; No. 5. In 1991, the &quot;Omaha&quot; story &quot;A Strip in Time&quot; appeared in &quot;Munden&#x27;s Bar Annual&quot; No. 2, published by First Comics.

In 1984, SteelDragon Press published the first issue of &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot;, which featured the second chapter of the story. Waller then was unable to continue with the story. The third chapter was completed with help from Kate Worley, who continued to write the series thereafter. 

The &quot;Omaha&quot; series began more regular publication in 1986 through by Kitchen Sink Press, which published 20 issues through June 1994. However, in August 1988, Worley was injured in a car accident; the series&#x27; frequency slowed as a result of her recovery process. In November 1991, Waller was diagnosed with colon cancer; two issues of &quot;Images of &quot;Omaha&quot;&quot; were published in 1992 to pay for Waller&#x27;s medical expenses, featuring art and writing by several major comic creators. In 1995, Waller and Worley ceased production of the series. In 2002, Waller and Worley agreed to complete the story; Worley was diagnosed with lung cancer, and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in that year. On June 6, 2004, Worley died before completing the story; her husband, James Vance, began to edit and complete the final chapters.

The series lasted 20 issues before being cancelled in 1993. Fantagraphics Books later relaunched the series, but it only lasted four issues, the last published in 1995. In 1994, Rob, a supporting character from the series, appeared in &quot;Gay Comix&quot; No. 22. The final chapters of the story were serialized in &quot;Sizzle&quot;, beginning in 2006.

From 1987 until 1998, Kitchen Sink, and later Fantagraphics, published six volumes of the &quot;Omaha&quot; strips under the title &quot;The Collected &quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot;. From 2005 to 2013, NBM Publishing imprint Amerotica published eight volumes of strips under the title &quot;The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;.

==Fictional background and characters==
&quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; takes place in the fictional Mipple City, Minnesota. The comic&#x27;s universe is populated by anthropomorphic animal characters. The story began as a satire of local blue laws, before evolving into a comic book soap opera.

===Characters===
* Susan &quot;Susie&quot; Jensen (though very few of the other characters know her real name) a.k.a. Omaha, an anthropomorphic feline stripper. After a while, she gets a pet ferret named Squeak. She was previously married years before meeting Charles Jr., but a divorce was later amicably arranged with her separated husband.
* Charles Tabey Jr. a.k.a. Chuck Katt, lover to Omaha; he turns out to be the heir to Charles Tabey Sr.
* Charles Tabey Sr., a powerful yet mentally ill business tycoon.
* Shelly Hine, a bisexual exotic dancer and Omaha&#x27;s best friend. She was caught in the line of fire and gunned down by a man named Andre DeRoc and is now in a wheelchair. Shelly was Charles Tabey Sr.&#x27;s lover and confidante. In the very early comics that appeared in &quot;Vootie&quot; magazine, she and Omaha were lovers.
* Joanne Follett, a prostitute.
* Kurt Huddle, Shelly&#x27;s nurse and later lover. Initially, the personal assistant and valet to Tabey Sr.
* Rob Shaw, a gay photographer.
* Maria Elandos Tabey, Chuck Tabey&#x27;s mother, whom he has not seen for years. She was blackmailed into leaving by Calvin Bonner over her gay brother. She also bears a very striking resemblance to Omaha.
* Senator Calvin Bonner, a state senator and business tycoon. A vocal public morality crusader and a complete hypocrite since he is one of Joanne&#x27;s regular, and more abusive, customers. He gets murdered by an unknown assassin during a session set up by Joanne to compromise him by having Rob Shaw take incriminating photos of him.
* George, owner of the Kitty Korner Klub, Omaha and Shelly worked at.
* Ceecee and Angie, two strippers who work at Mr. Pip&#x27;s Nite Club.

==Plot summary==
Susan (Susie) Jensen is an aspiring model from the Midwest and new in the town of Mipple City, Minnesota. The story starts out as Susie uses her modeling to begin working at the strip club &quot;Kitty Korner Klub&quot; with her newfound friend Shelly Hine, where she now goes by the stage name of &quot;Omaha&quot;. Omaha starts to become well known after she is featured for the first time in &quot;Pet Magazine&quot;, an adult entertainment magazine, as the centerfold &quot;Kitten of the Month&quot;.

After working as a locally popular dancer, she and Shelly meet Chuck Katt, an artist who begins to fall in love with Omaha and whom she considers &quot;normal&quot;. After a new blue law is passed, &quot;all strip clubs are to be closed down&quot;, Omaha and Shelly are put out of work. Shelly soon finds a hidden sub-basement at a restaurant that is owned by a man named Charles Tabey, a powerful, yet mentally ill business tycoon, with Shelly as his lover in secret. With Omaha out of work, Chuck Katt starts working for his former boss, Andre DeRoc, a media mogul in the town and the arch-rival of Charles Tabey.

==Timeline and social impact==
&quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; was the first of several comic books in the early 1980s which integrated sex into their storylines, rather than using sexual explicitness for shock value. In 1988, Friendly Frank&#x27;s, a comic book store in suburban Chicago, was fined $750 for selling &quot;obscene&quot; material, including &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot;; as a result of the obscenity controversy, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund was formed. In 1990, issues of &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; were seized by New Zealand authorities; the country&#x27;s Obscene Publications Tribunal declared that the series was not indecent. In the same year, police in Toronto seized issues of the comic, claiming that it depicted bestiality.

Martin A. Stever reviewed &quot;Omaha, The Cat Dancer&quot; for &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;the plot is so rich that it would be a disservice to attempt to sum it up in the small space available here. It is better said that it is a story that does not pull punches and in its essence rings more true to the values of our time than anything short of Tom Wolfe&quot;.

In &quot;Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics&quot;, D. Aviva Rothschild praised the series, finding the plot as strong, and the characters as three-dimensional and appealing. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Alex Heard panned the comic, writing that &quot;the story moves very slowly [...] one can readily agree with the disgruntled fan who wrote, &#x27;My God! Where did you dredge up those horrid characters?

In 1992, Kitchen Sink published two volumes of &quot;Images of &quot;Omaha&quot;&quot; as a benefit to pay for the treatment of Waller&#x27;s bowel cancer. The volumes featured contributions by major comic book artists, such as Dave Sim, Alan Moore and Frank Miller. Trina Robbins, James Vance and Neil Gaiman have provided introductions to collected editions of the series. &quot;&quot;Omaha&quot; the Cat Dancer&quot; was nominated for Eisner Awards for Best Continuing Series, Best Black-and-White Series, and Best Writer/Artist in 1989; and Best Black and White Series and Best Writer in 1991.

<doc id="707097" wikidata="Q1735148" url="?curid=707097" title="Kasparov versus the World">
<text>Kasparov versus the World was a game of chess played in 1999 over the Internet. It was a , in which a World Team of thousands decided each move for the black pieces by plurality vote, while Garry Kasparov conducted the white pieces by himself. More than 50,000 people from over 75 countries participated in the game.

The host and promoter of the match was the MSN Gaming Zone, with sponsorship from First USA bank. After 62 moves played over four months, Kasparov won the game. The game produced a mixture of deep tactical and strategic ideas; Kasparov wrote that he had never expended as much effort on any other game in his life. He later said, &quot;It is the greatest game in the history of chess. The sheer number of ideas, the complexity, and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played.&quot;

==Background==
In the 1990s, Garry Kasparov was considered the reigning chess champion. Kasparov says he originally discussed the idea of a correspondence match in 1997 after his second match with Deep Blue in 1997; his friend Fred Friedel suggested arranging such a match and to work with the newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. Nothing came of it, but Kasparov was intrigued. He was interested in expanding his presence on the Internet, and thought he could get more interest from investors if he could measure a potential audience and show interest. He looked to partner with an existing major Internet presence who would be able to handle an event of its size and came to Microsoft, which was happy to work with him. The event would be run on the MSN Gaming Zone website.

The main concern for Microsoft was the possibility that the game could turn into a farce if the World were to succumb to blunders that would turn the game into a rout early. The most prominent previous example of majority Internet voting had produced only mediocre competition; in 1996, Anatoly Karpov easily defeated the voters against him in such a match. As such, several innovative measures were taken. Analysts would explain the situation for more casual voters and help the World avoid catastrophic blunders. Kasparov, however, did not want the match to turn into a grudge match with a rival grandmaster (GM), figuring that this would be too close to his normal matches. It was decided that several teenage chess stars would be recruited to aid the World team and suggest moves. MSN recruited (in decreasing order of FIDE rating) 16-year-old GM Étienne Bacrot, 19-year-old Florin Felecan, 15-year-old Irina Krush (already the U.S. Women&#x27;s Chess champion), and 14-year-old Elisabeth Paehtz. GM Daniel King would provide overall running commentary and act as a moderator; while not directly recommending moves to the World Team, he could act as a fifth advocate and clarify the state of the position. The pace of the game was also set to one move a day: 12 hours for Kasparov to move, 12 hours for the analysts to see the move and write recommendations, 18 hours for the World Team to vote and discuss, and 6 hours to validate voting. Also, MSN provided a bulletin board forum for the discussion of the World Team&#x27;s moves. It was hoped that these advantages would raise the level of play and keep the game exciting.

The World Team also benefited from computer chess analysis. Interested voters such as &quot;The Computer Chess Team&quot; used distributed computing to analyze possible lines and make recommendations to the World. Kasparov himself consulted with Yury Dokhoian and Boris Alterman for advice at times.

The game was launched on June 21, 1999, with a promotional event at Bryant Park in New York for the kickoff that featured both Kasparov and World Team advisor Irina Krush.

==The game==
White: Garry Kasparov Black: The World Team Opening: Sicilian Defence, Canal–Sokolsky Attack (&quot;ECO&quot; B52)

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+
Kasparov played his first move 1.e4 on June 21, and the World Team voted by a 41% plurality to meet him on his home turf with the Sicilian Defence. Kasparov&#x27;s third move was unusual for him. He typically plays the more ambitious 3.d4 in this position, which promptly leads to an . Kasparov commented that Bb5+ had something of a weak reputation until the 1990s, but he had been impressed with both Vasyl Ivanchuk and Alexei Shirov playing it against him for a win. Additionally, Vladimir Kramnik had played it twice against Boris Gelfand at the 1994 Candidates, winning once and drawing the other game. Kasparov was apologetic about the move, but excused himself in light of his expected upcoming championship match against Vishy Anand, where he expected the Najdorf Sicilian—a natural extension of 3.d4—to be a potential battlefield.

3... Bd7 4. Bxd7+ Qxd7 5. c4

Some 30% of viewers wanted Black to play 4...Nxd7, but were outvoted by those who thought Black&#x27;s queen was safe on the light squares with White&#x27;s light-squared bishop off and preferred to the knight to c6. With c4, Kasparov solidified his hold on the d5-square by advancing the c-pawn before developing his , which joined the attack on d5 on the next move. The resulting pawn formation for White is sometimes called the Maróczy Bind, a way of Black&#x27;s position. The World Team responded by contesting control of the d4-square.

5... Nc6 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. 0-0 g6

Now Black must try to castle on the and can set it up by developing the to either the e- or g-. Rather than move the e-pawn to e6 or e5 and have the dark-squared bishop blocked by the d-pawn, the World Team opted to fianchetto the remaining bishop, further contesting the dark central squares. Kasparov immediately broke up the with his , before the black bishop could come to bear.

8. d4 cxd4 9. Nxd4 Bg7 10. Nde2

The center was too hot for the white knight on d4, because the World Team was threatening a discovered attack by moving the black knight away from f6, unmasking the g7-bishop. Exchanging knights on c6 would have been silly for Kasparov, as it would have brought a black pawn to c6, giving the World Team greater control of d5; instead, a retreat was in order. All of Kasparov&#x27;s moves up to this point were considered good according to opening theory of the time. If White had wanted to achieve the strategic aims of this opening line, i.e. cramping Black&#x27;s position without allowing , then either a different move (10.Nc2) or a different move order was necessary. Slightly more popular today is 7.d4 and after 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qe6 would now lose the queen. 7.d4 does allow two other queen sorties with 7... Qg4 or after 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qg4.

10... Qe6
Black finally secured the opportunity to castle but instead opted to complicate the position. This move was a by the World Team, i.e. a move which had never before been played in a recorded game. Krush discovered and analyzed the move, and enlisted Paehtz to recommend it as well, to give it a better chance of winning the vote. Their combined advocacy, plus much discussion on the bulletin board, was enough to gain it 53% of the vote. After this move, MSN requested that the four official analysts not coordinate with each other, perhaps to ensure a greater variety of recommendations. The analysts worked in isolation from each other thereafter.

10...Qe6 has since been played frequently, though 10...0-0 also remains popular, according to ChessBase. The move was played against Kasparov again in a 2009 match against Gabriel Gaehwiler.

The tenth move was a turning point for the World Team, not only because it increased Krush&#x27;s stature and energized the World Team, but because it blew the position on the board wide open. The black queen forked Kasparov&#x27;s central pawns; he could not save them both. Counterattacking with 11.Qb3 would have been met by 11...0-0 12.Qxb7 Rfc8, and the World Team would have won back a with a favorable game. Kasparov was forced to enter the maelstrom with the next several moves.

11. Nd5 Qxe4 12. Nc7+ Kd7 13. Nxa8 Qxc4 14. Nb6+ axb6
After on both sides, Kasparov made a desperado move with his knight to cause the World Team to have doubled pawns. the game was still even, with a knight and two pawns balancing a rook. , the World Team had the disadvantages of doubled pawns and a centralized king, but the advantage of a lead in development and a central pawn mass. With no central pawns, Kasparov had no clear-cut way to expose the black king. In the judgment of many commentators, the World Team was at least equal, and it was perhaps Kasparov who was fighting uphill.

Kasparov rose to the challenge with an excellent move picked from alternatives which would have let the World Team take a strong initiative. For instance, it was tempting to harass the black queen and possibly fianchetto the with 15.b3, but this would have invited the World Team to switch wings and initiate a attack with 15...Qh4. Or, to blindly follow the rule &quot;never move a piece twice in the opening when you can develop another piece&quot; with 15.Be3 would have allowed the World Team to play 15...Nd5, bringing the black knight to the square it most fervently wished to occupy. Kasparov&#x27;s actual move contested d5, somewhat blunted the effect of the black bishop on g7, and retained a compact, flexible position.

15. Nc3

On the fifteenth move the World Team hotly debated a number of promising alternatives, including 15...e6 (still contesting d5), 15...d5 (occupying d5 outright!), 15...Ne4 (trading off Kasparov&#x27;s best-placed piece), 15...Rd8 (intending to artificially castle and mobilize the central pawns), 15...Ra8 (pressuring the and threatening a via a5), and 15...b5 (threatening to dislodge the white knight and pressure the queenside). The plethora of strong options available to the World Team was reflected in the analysts&#x27; recommending four different moves.

By this point in the game, several chess clubs had begun posting daily analysis to complement what was available on the official bulletin board and Web site of the game. The weightiest of these was the &quot;Grandmaster Chess School&quot; or GM School, a consortium of Russian grandmasters in St. Petersburg. For the World Team&#x27;s 15th move, they recommended 15...b5, along with Paehtz. Some people expected the unofficial recommendation of the GM School to be influential, particularly when the official analysts could not agree, but 15...b5 came in a distant second with 15% of the vote. In first place was Jon Speelman&#x27;s idea of 15...Ra8 with 48% of the vote.

15... Ra8

The results of the vote were a reflection of the increasing coordination of the World Team. Krush was maintaining an analysis tree, and continually updating with all the suggestions and refutations from the bulletin board. Not only did the analysis tree allow the World Team to work with less duplication of effort, it served as a standing, detailed argument for the correctness of the recommended move.

In short, Krush was facilitating two tasks simultaneously: not only discovering a good move, but building a consensus that it was indeed a good move. Given that she had become the center of all the cooperative effort of the World Team (as opposed to individual effort, however heroic), even players of much greater strength began sharing their ideas with her, so that she would incorporate them into her analysis. In particular, Alexander Khalifman of the GM School struck up a constructive correspondence with her.

16. a4!

This move was directed at the World&#x27;s maneuverer 16...Ra5, which could now be met by 17.Nb5!, paralyzing Black&#x27;s queenside. Simultaneously, Kasparov threatened a rook lift of his own via Ra3, which could disrupt Black&#x27;s plans in several continuations. Finally, 16.a4 prevented the World Team&#x27;s doubled b-pawns from advancing, thus making them future targets. The game remained very unclear and dynamic, but it suddenly appeared to be the World Team which was fighting to maintain the equilibrium.

Again for the 16th move the four analysts made four different recommendations. This time Krush&#x27;s suggestion of 16...Ne4 garnered 50% of the vote to 14% for 16...Nd4 in second place.

16... Ne4 17. Nxe4 Qxe4 18. Qb3
On the 16th move, the World Team Kasparov to trade off his only piece that was not on the , and simultaneously unmasked the action of the g7-bishop. Kasparov responded with a queen fork of the black pawns on b6 and f7. The loss of a pawn appeared unavoidable, but the World Team uncovered ways to gain some . The bulletin board debate raged between playing 18...e6 19.Qxb6 Nd4, to make sure it was the weak doubled pawn which went missing, or the more aggressive immediate 18...Nd4, allowing 19.Qxf7. Khalifman, however, found the extremely subtle move 18...f5, and after chewing it over, the bulletin board was more or less convinced.

The strength of the bulletin board consensus was tested when the other three analysts unanimously recommended 18...Nd4. The vote came out with 43% in favor of Krush&#x27;s recommendation of 18...f5, and 35% in favor of the otherwise unanimous recommendation of 18...Nd4. This sparked grumbling on the bulletin board that Krush had &quot;taken over the game&quot;. Krush&#x27;s influence on the voters was clear; her recommendations were selected every single move from the 10th to the 50th.

18... f5!

The World Team conceded Kasparov the b6 pawn, but for a price. After 19.Qxb6 Nd4, the World Team would have had dual threats of Nc2 and Ra6, ensuring very active play for the pawn. If instead Kasparov continued developing with 19.Be3, the World Team could have offered a queen trade with 19...Qb4, and banked on the central pawn mass to be quite strong in any endgame. But rather than these, Kasparov once again found a powerful continuation: a developing move with stronger attacking possibilities.

19. Bg5

Kasparov, up against stiff resistance from the World Team, began to drop hints that he was effectively playing against the GM School, and not against the Internet as a whole, but move 19 contradicted this line of thought. The GM School recommended 19...Qd4, while the bulletin board found a flaw in their analysis, and generally favored 19...Qb4 as being more forcing. Furthermore, for much of the game, a few top grandmasters of the GM School were busy with other commitments, and the World Team analysis was driven instead by a handful of dedicated International Masters, United States Masters, and dozens of amateurs exploring lines with chess software.

On this particular move, the voting was further complicated by a large faction in favor of 19...Nd4, with a counterattack, and this was the recommendation of both Felecan and Paehtz. The winning total of 35% for 19...Qb4 was the lowest winning total for any move of the game, perhaps because the move essentially forced Kasparov to intensify his attack on the kingside. Note that a queen trade was strategically out of the question for White, as it leads to a favorable endgame for Black.

19... Qb4 20. Qf7
On move twenty it was tempting for the World Team to grab a pawn and protect the g7-bishop with 20...Qxb2, daring the white rooks to occupy whichever files they chose, but in many continuations the World Team&#x27;s king would sit rather uncomfortably in the center. After much debate on the bulletin board, no clear refutation of the pawn grab was discovered, but it was still deemed too risky by many. Bacrot, Felecan, Paehtz, and King independently agreed, and by a large margin the World Team decided to protect the bishop and close the e-file with

20... Be5!

Kasparov did not fall for the simple trap of grabbing the h-pawn, (21.Qxh7 Rh8 skewering Kasparov&#x27;s queen and h-pawn: 22.Qxg6 Bxh2+ 23.Kh1 Qg4 with at least an extra piece for the World Team) but opted for a simple defensive move which restored his threat to plunder Black&#x27;s kingside.

21. h3

A few World Team members favored shoring up the kingside with 21...Rh8, effectively admitting that the 15th move was a mistake. To defend in that way would have left Black with a very passive position, and invited Kasparov to activate his pieces. Instead, the World Team opted to play actively, exchanging the kingside pawns for Kasparov&#x27;s queenside pawns. This line showed that the pressure the black rook exerted on the queenside was not illusory, and Kasparov&#x27;s reply on move 16, albeit brilliant, did create a weakness.

21... Rxa4 22. Rxa4 Qxa4 23. Qxh7 Bxb2 24. Qxg6 Qe4 25. Qf7 Bd4
The dust settled, and the material was still even, with a rook balancing a knight and two pawns. With a pair of rooks exchanged, and neither side having pawn levers to use against the enemy king, both kings were safe enough that direct attacks became less likely. Therefore, although the queens remained on the board, the game started to take the character of an endgame, with the struggle to promote a pawn rising to the foreground. Indeed, Kasparov could have immediately begun marching his h-pawn forward, and the World Team would have had difficulty restraining it. On the other hand, the World Team&#x27;s b-pawn would have been able to advance equally quickly, making the position very double-edged. Rather than launching the at once, Kasparov made a subtle move to tie down the World Team into a more passive position.

26. Qb3

Kasparov hit at the weak b-pawn, and prepared Be3. The World Team did not want to trade bishops, and considered the consolidating move 26...Bc5 so that 27.Be3 could be met with 27...Nd4. Kasparov had the even deeper threat, however, of first using his queen to help his rook into play. After 26...Bc5 27.Qb1!, the World Team could not have accepted a queen exchange which would bring the white rook to life, but moving the queen away would allow 28.Re1, and suddenly the white pieces would be coordinating very well.

Consistent with previous moves, the World Team found a , active alternative in 26...f4, which extensive analysis showed to be at least as good as 26...Bc5. However, Krush&#x27;s recommendation on behalf of the bulletin board once again stood alone against the unanimous recommendations of the other three analysts. In an extremely close vote, 26...f4 edged out 26...Bc5 by a margin of 42.61% to 42.14%.

26... f4!

The World Team blocked off Kasparov&#x27;s bishop from its natural post on e3, and threatened to generate an attack on the white king after all. 27.Qb1 could be met by 27...Bxf2+, while 27.Qd1 would run into 27...f3, and starting the pawn race with 27.h4 would be answered by 27...Ne5 with attacking play for the World Team. Kasparov instead opted for a simple and natural move.

27. Qf7

Moving the queen to the square it just came from only appeared to lose a tempo. In actuality, the World Team had to use a move to defend the f-pawn. Furthermore, the white queen indirectly supported Kasparov&#x27;s h-pawn to advance, and put the brakes on the World Team&#x27;s threat of advancing the f-pawn to f3. After the World Team defended the f-pawn, Kasparov decided to launch the race to which had been hovering in the background for several moves.

27... Be5 28. h4 b5 29. h5 Qc4
The World Team could not afford to blindly keep racing the b-pawn forward with 29...b4, because the white queen still guarded the b3-square, which Black would have to lose a tempo to guard before advancing again. The move 29...Qc4, in contrast, did not lose a tempo, because Kasparov could not afford to trade queens in a way that would have undoubled the black pawns and given the World Team a central pawn steamroller for the endgame. The alternative 29...Qe2 also might have held the fort for Black, by offering to exchange the white h-pawn for the black f-pawn. As part of the trade, however, the bishops would also have come off, and none of the four analysts were prepared to trade the World Team&#x27;s lovely bishop for Kasparov&#x27;s cramped one just yet.

Some of the bulletin board analysis focused on Kasparov&#x27;s possible reply 30.Qf8, keeping the queens on the board and threatening to harass the black king from behind. Computer checking of many lines, however, found no advantage for White in this strategy, and in fact revealed chances for White to press too hard in a complex position and stumble into disadvantage. Kasparov elected to force a queen trade, break free his imprisoned bishop, open the f-file for his rook, and create connected passed pawns in a pure endgame. The World Team&#x27;s responses were essentially forced.

30. Qf5+ Qe6 31. Qxe6+ Kxe6 32. g3 fxg3 33. fxg3
Despite the reduced material, the position remained sharp due to the presence of six passed pawns. On move 32 Kasparov initiates a sequence that after a pawn exchange will open the f file for his rook and leave a supporting g pawn for his h pawn. On move 33, the World Team had the option of snatching Kasparov&#x27;s g-pawn, losing two tempi in the queening race. After the sequence 33...Bxg3 34.h6 Be5 35.h7 Bg7 36.Rf8 b4 37.h8=Q Bxh8 38.Rxh8 an extremely unbalanced endgame would have ensued, with Kasparov having a rook and bishop versus the World Team&#x27;s knight and four pawns. The central position of the black king might have been just enough to hold a draw for the World Team, but none of the four analysts trusted the position enough to recommend it. Instead the World Team opted for counterplay, as usual, this time by a vote of 72%.

33... b4 34. Bf4

Kasparov&#x27;s offer to trade bishops caught the bulletin board entirely off guard. It had been assumed that Kasparov would try to bring his king into the center to restrain the black pawns, and the World Team gave deep thought to 34.Kf2 Kf5. After Kasparov&#x27;s actual move, it would have been suicide for the World Team to trade off the precious bishop. 34...Bd4+ looked promising, particularly because it would not lose a tempo, since Kasparov would have to move out of check. After the game, Kasparov said that he would not have been able to break through if the World Team had played the more defensive 34...Bh8, but the possibility did not receive much attention on the bulletin board. Danny King forwarded 34...Bh8 in his running commentary, but all four official analysts felt more comfortable with the more active move, so 34...Bd4+ overwhelmingly won the vote.

34... Bd4+

The World Team had hastily put together proposed defenses against either of Kasparov&#x27;s king advances 35.Kg2 and 35.Kh2. In one of the former lines, the black knight threatens to usher home the b-pawn and returns to the kingside just barely in time to stop the white h-pawn, delivering a check from f4 on the way. In one of the latter lines it turned out to be critical that the black bishop could attack the white king from e5. But Kasparov stunned everyone (including the GM School) with an incredible move:

35. Kh1!

Although it intuitively makes little sense to move the white king away from the action into a corner where it can neither support the white pawns toward queening, nor delay the black pawns from queening, this move put the World Team in a serious predicament. Some posters on the bulletin board worried that the 33rd move had lost the game for the World Team.

In the scramble following Kasparov&#x27;s 35th move, no one on the World Team noticed that 35...Ne5 is probably enough to hold the draw, and opted for pushing the b-pawn, influenced by Krush who had discovered what seemed to be adequate continuations for the World Team.

35... b3 36. g4
In this position Kasparov had connected passed pawns supporting each other, whereas the World Team needed the knight (or possibly even the king) to laboriously move into position to usher the black b-pawn to queening. Furthermore, should the black bishop move, the white rook could slide over to g1 where it would support the g-pawn from behind while still keeping an eye on the b1 queening square, an additional subtle point of Kasparov&#x27;s 35th move. Finally, by temporarily controlling the dark squares with his bishop and the light squares with his pawns (which 36.h6 would not have done) Kasparov kept the black king from advancing to f5, which in some lines would have been sufficient to blockade the pawns.

The bulletin board was near despair at this point, having convinced itself that 36...b2 would lose to 37.g5 Nb4 38.g6 Nd3 39.h6, and then 39...Nxf4 would not be check due to Kasparov&#x27;s 35th move, and would therefore fail to hold the draw. Similarly an immediate 36...Nb4 would merely transpose to the above line and lose. The only move for which some lines seemed still possibly drawn was 36...Kd5, which Krush duly recommended, but Bacrot and Felecan suggested 36...b2, while Paehtz favored 36...Nb4. This created yet another razor-thin vote, with 36...Kd5 scoring 37.69% of the vote winning over 36...b2 with 37.11%.

36... Kd5!

This game, which had started in June, had now spilled over into September. Kasparov had grown sufficiently confident in his position that he called a press conference about the game, presumably in order to announce a . The black pieces did not seem up to the task of both holding off the white pawns and pushing through the black pawn, while the white rook was working effectively through threats alone, without even moving.

37. g5

Kasparov&#x27;s two passers apparently required two black pieces to restrain, but the black knight could not cross over via e5 because Kasparov would have simply exchanged the white bishop for it. Therefore, the bulletin board turned its attention to 37...e5, driving away the white bishop and clearing the way for Ne7. But Kasparov had a devilish reply in 38.Bc1! His pawns would be so strong in this line that he could have sacrificed his bishop for Black&#x27;s b-pawn, particularly since the black bishop would be temporarily cut off from the h8 queening square. Also, in many lines where Black does not force the white bishop to give itself up, it can reverse field with Ba3, tying the black king to the defense of the d6 pawn.

Concerned about the strength of 38.Bc1!, the World Team instead replied:

37... e6

This move opened e7 so the black knight could cross over, but also kept open the a1–h8 diagonal for the black bishop. Kasparov perhaps had thought that 38.Rd1 was winning in this line, a position many participants on the bulletin board agreed with. A Post-game exhaustive analysis shows that 38.Rd1 was winning via a full board zugzwang at move 50, if the world team responded with 38...Ke4. The power of the centralized black king vis-a-vis the white king off in the corner would come into play, showing that even brilliant chess moves have minor disadvantages.

Instead of trying the complexities of the 38.Rd1 line, Kasparov said at his press conference that he had no idea how the game would turn out, and began to force the World Team into an ending in which each side got a new queen, and the outcome was still unclear.

38. h6 Ne7 39. Rd1 e5 40. Be3 Kc4 41. Bxd4 exd4
The World Team&#x27;s moves were all essentially forced. Kasparov&#x27;s main chance to deviate would have been with 40.Bc1, but then 40...Ke6 appeared to hold. Although the black bishop was at that time temporarily cut off from holding back the pawns, the black king was temporarily not cut off, and an extra tempo in such positions makes all the difference. Kasparov, when making his 38th move, had in all probability already elected to force the World Team&#x27;s responses all the way to move 50.

The World Team&#x27;s pawns, albeit ungainly, had become a sufficiently potent threat that Kasparov&#x27;s rook could not serve the double purpose of guarding the home rank and forcing through the passed pawns against Black&#x27;s knight. Therefore, the white king had to come out of its corner at last.

42. Kg2 b2 43. Kf3 Kc3 44. h7

Kasparov could have made the pawn advance on either of the two previous moves as well, but it would have merely transposed, with the World Team responding as it did in the actual game:

44... Ng6 45. Ke4 Kc2 46. Rh1
The World Team needed to advance the d-pawn as well as the b-pawn, in order to get a second queen after Kasparov sacrificed his rook for the first one. Against the recommendations of the analysts, nine percent of the World Team voted for the tempting prospect of immediately queening the b-pawn, which is a blunder that loses after 46...b1=Q 47.Rxb1 Kxb1 48.Kxd4. The white king arrived to assist the white pawns just as quickly with diagonal moves as with straight ones, and the diagonal moves gave it incidental threats in the center.

46... d3 47. Kf5

For the World Team&#x27;s 47th move, the analysts were again unanimous, this time recommending immediate queening. 15% of the voters were tempted to try to hang onto the knight a few moves longer with 47...Nh8. This would have led to a lost endgame after 48.g6 d2 49.g7 d1=Q 50.Rxd1 Kxd1 51.gxh8=Q b1=Q+, when Black cannot engineer a perpetual check.

47... b1=Q 48. Rxb1 Kxb1 49. Kxg6 d2 50. h8=Q d1=Q
The race to queen a pawn ended in a tie. The position was not equal, though. Kasparov&#x27;s far-advanced g-pawn was an imminent threat to queen, while the World Team&#x27;s pawns were potentially liabilities as much as assets, since they could give the white king a modicum of shelter from threatened checks. The general plan of defense for the World Team was to place the king favorably so that Kasparov could not threaten a deadly queen trade, and then determinedly check Kasparov&#x27;s king to prevent him from queening the g-pawn. In some lines the World Team could gain counterplay by advancing its own pawns, but this was a secondary strategy.

The World Team had relied heavily on computer analysis for much of the game, but at this point the forward-searching chess engines began to produce worthless suggestions. This type of position was not well-handled by 1999 chess programs, until the position became simple enough to use an endgame tablebase. As of October 1999, however, there were no seven-piece endgame tablebases, and seven pieces remained in the actual position. After the game was over, Peter Karrer of Switzerland constructed a specialized tablebase for the purpose of fully understanding this endgame. With the aid of the tablebase, Krush and IM Ken Regan were able to prove that the position after the World Team&#x27;s 50th move was drawn with best play on both sides. Both Kasparov and the bulletin board suspected that the position was drawn, but as the further course of the game proved, no one fully understood the position at the time.

Some World Team members tried to gain insight from the position by consulting state-of-the-art five-piece tablebases, with the black pawns missing, and were encouraged to find the position dead drawn. Unfortunately for the World Team, the extra black pawns complicated the position enormously, and not necessarily to the World Team&#x27;s advantage. For example, analysis positions arose which were theoretically drawn with both black pawns in place, but which would be won for White if exactly one black pawn were not there, and then again drawn with both black pawns gone.

Since 2012, seven-piece Lomonosov tablebases have become available which prove that the position is drawn. Moreover, using a special EGTB generator &quot;Hoffman&quot; developed by Brent Baccala, it can be shown that Black can draw without trying to promote its pawns and without moving its king out of the a–d × 1–4 square.

51. Qh7

This move threatened to gain Kasparov a tempo by advancing the king with discovered check. The bulletin board and Krush came up with the response 51...Ka1, which Kasparov later said he had considered as a dead draw, and the subsequent endgame tablebases confirmed to be so. But Felecan recommended 51...d5 and Paehtz favored 51...b5, while Bacrot sat out the turn. For the first time in 40 moves, Krush&#x27;s recommendation was not selected, receiving only 34% for 51...Ka1. 39% of votes were for Elisabeth Paehtz&#x27;s 51...b5.

Someone using the alias &quot;Jose Unodos&quot; joked that he rigged the vote for the Paehtz suggestion 51...b7–b5 instead of Kb1–a1 that Krush and most others thought the best move, although MSN said afterward vote-stuffing only affected move 59.

51... b5 52. Kf6+

The bulletin board and Krush now concluded that 52...Kc1 offered the best chances of holding a draw. Kasparov versus the World 1999 analysis via Peter Karrer&#x27;s special computer program for the position, which was fashioned two weeks after the game was over: If 52...Kc1! (but 52...Kb2 was played in the game), 53.Qe4! Qf1+ 54.Ke7 b4. Here if 55.Qb4, Black must find 55...Qf5 (the only move) 56.Qc3+ Kb1 57.Qf6 Qe4+ (only move) 58.Kf7 Qc4!+ 59.Kg7 d5 (only move) so Black can draw. Upon 55.g6! Qg1! 56.Qf4+ Kd1! 57.Kf7 b3=. Also on 55.g6 Qg1 56.Qc4+ Kd1 57.Qd3+ Kc1—here White cannot theoretically progress. However, with Bacrot recommending 52...Ka1 and both Felecan and Paehtz favoring 52...Kb2, the latter move eked out a victory with 42%. The idea was to use the king to support the b-pawn toward promotion, and tablebases show that either move will hold a draw.

52... Kb2

Kasparov made a reasonable-looking queen maneuver to shelter his king from checks on the f-file:

53. Qh2+

It was postulated at the time that 52...Kb2 was a game-losing mistake, and that Kasparov could have won the game by force after 53. Qe4, but modern tablebases don&#x27;t bear that out.

53...Ka1! 54. Qf4
Krush and others on the MSN forum recommended sacrificing the b-pawn with 54...b4 in order to allow the black queen to give check on the f-file. This was partly based on the modified tablebases, which needed to assume exchanges to reach an error-free conclusion, by reducing the number of pieces and possibilities. Bacrot advocated centralizing the black queen with 54...Qd5!, while Felecan and Paehtz suggested 54...Qd3.

Later analysis showed that Bacrot&#x27;s recommendation could hold the draw in a relatively comprehensible fashion, and Felecan and Paehtz&#x27;s move could hold after some desperate ingenious squirming, but Krush&#x27;s move would concede Kasparov a forced win, if he could find it.
54... b4?

This move was the first mistake made in the seven-piece endgame. The tablebase shows that either 54...Qd3 or 54...Qd5 gives a theoretical draw. The idea was to get more activity with their queen and be able to force White&#x27;s king into several checks; however, it was shown that with good piece coordination the white king would be able to escape the checks and White would promote first with a winning position, demonstrated by Kasparov in the game.

55. Qxb4 Qf3+ 56. Kg7 d5 57. Qd4+ Kb1 58. g6
Kasparov played forcefully on moves 55–57, and the World Team responded each time with a large majority for the best plausible move. On move 58, both 58...Qe4 and 58...Qf5 looked reasonable, but the bulletin board had analyzed the former to a forced loss. Krush duly recommended the latter. Due to an e-mail mix-up, her recommendation and analysis were not received on time by the MSN site, and voting proceeded for some time with Bacrot and Paehtz both recommending 58...Qe4 against Felecan favoring 58...Qf5. When the weaker move won the vote 49% to 44%, there were dismayed cries from the bulletin board that the game was lost due to the delay of Krush&#x27;s recommendation, as Krush&#x27;s recommendations had been closely followed by voters in earlier moves. Krush was still in high school at the time and for this late-breaking move Krush could stay up no longer, and hence her hurried email later in the day.

Kasparov agreed that 58...Qf5 would have put up stiffer resistance, but claimed it was also losing, and published a forced win sequence. Subsequently, tablebases showed an error in Kasparov&#x27;s analysis, but confirmed that 58...Qf5 could not have saved the draw with best play on both sides. The main line starts with 58...Qf5 59.Kh6 Qe6 60.Qg1+ Ka2 61.Qf2+ Kb1 62.Qd4 Ka2 63.Kg5 Qe7+ 64.Qf6 Qe3+ 65.Qf4 Qg1+ 66.Kf6 Qb6+ 67.Kf7 Qb7+ 68.Ke6 Qc8+ 69.Kf6 Qd8+ 70.Kf5 Qc8+ 71.Kg5 Qc3 72.Qh2+ Ka1 73.Qe2 Kb1 74.Qf2 Qc1+ 75.Kg4 Qc3 76.Qf1+ Kc2 (or 76...Kb2 77.Kf5 Qc7 78.Qe2+ Kb1) 77.Kf5 Qc7 78.Qe2+ Kb1 79.Qd3+ Ka2 80.Qa6+ Kb3 81.Qe6 Ka2 82.Qf7 Qc2+ 83.Ke6 Qe2+ 84.Kxd5.

58... Qe4 59. Qg1+

At this point several disgruntled members of the bulletin board, knowing the game to be lost, suggested the blunder 59...Qe1. The move 59...Qe1?? got the majority of the votes the next round of voting, but Microsoft invalidated all votes due to ballot stuffing. MSN announced after the game that this was the only move on which ballot stuffing had taken place at a level where it was significant. Microsoft added a resign option to the next vote, which got 28% of the vote after it was first added – a high number, but not the plurality.

59... Kb2 60. Qf2+ Kc1 61. Kf6 d4 62. g7 

With his 62nd move, Kasparov announced a in 28 moves found by the computer program Deep Junior. In light of this, 51% of the World Team voters opted to resign on October 22, four months after the game commenced.

==Aftermath==
Kasparov said, &quot;I spent more time analyzing this than any other game.&quot; After the game, Kasparov shocked many people on the MSN forum, which was kept open after multiple requests, by announcing he had been reading the World Team strategy board during the game. This dialogue occurred in the follow-up chat room interview: &quot;Host Chris_MSNBC says: Did you come frequently read our comments in the BBS? Host Garry_Kasparov says: Of course I used it to my advantage to look around and follow the discussion on MSN.COM about the game&quot;. He also gave the team credit for a game at the highest level: &quot;I think that the world deserves to make a draw...&quot;. Kasparov justified his decision by claiming he needed an advantage. In later World Team games, more secure forums were created with passwords, or the opponent at least pledged to not read the World Team forum.

In 2000, Kasparov published a book about the match: &quot;Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge&quot;, co-written with GM Daniel King. The 202-page book holds the record for the longest analysis devoted to a single chess game.

<text>Barbara Ryan is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. In the early 1970s, Barbara was played by a succession of actresses, but the actress most associated with the role is Colleen Zenk, who played her since September 1, 1978. She is portrayed as a heroine who experienced many tragedies, mostly at the hands of her controlling ex-husband, the villainous James Stenbeck (Anthony Herrera). Barbara is the daughter of Jennifer Sullivan.

Over her 32 years on the show, Barbara has been shot through the heart, nearly gored by a bull in Spain, kidnapped 15 times, married nine times, burned in a chemical explosion and jumped out of a three-story window.

After years of being a heroine, Barbara was transformed when writer Douglas Marland came on board at ATWT in 1985. He decided to make Barbara a &quot;bitch&quot; of sorts, and had her break up long standing couple Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery. This proved to be unpopular, and Marland quickly reverted the character back to being &quot;good&quot; by pairing Barbara with Oakdale police detective (and later chief) Hal Munson (Benjamin Hendrickson). Again, in the early 2000s (decade), writer Hogan Sheffer turned Barbara back into a scheming villain. Burned up in a chemical explosion in 2001 with the actress donning special effects make-up for a full year, Barbara returned to her evil ways and culminated in her committing crimes such as drugging a police officer and hiring a hit man to murder Rose D&#x27;Angelo (Martha Byrne). She then kidnapped three of her female adversaries (Emily Stewart, Carly Tenney and Rose D&#x27;Angelo).
Though the character has since reformed and become a more or less law-abiding presence in Oakdale, she can still be manipulative and devious when she feels she needs to be.

Entertainment reporter Lisa Joyner described the character as a &quot;sultry vixen&quot; who&#x27;d made the transition from &quot;helpless victim to scheming villain,&quot; whilst TV Guide&#x27;s Michael Logan called the character Oakdale&#x27;s &quot;firecracker.&quot;

==Creation and casting==

===Casting===
The character of Barbara Ryan was first seen on the show in 1971, she was played by Judi Rolin. Barbara Stranger took over the role briefly that same year, before being played by Donna Wandrey from 1971 to 1972. After six years off screen, Barbara was recast and returned to the show, now played by dancer and actress Colleen Zenk. Zenk began the role on September 1 of that year and stated her maternal grandparents never owned a television until her debut on As the World Turns.
&quot;Those were the people I heard from. Back then there was no internet, there was no way of getting any information from anyone until the fan mail started pouring in, which it did. I received a nice response from the beginning. I think that’s because I very quickly settled into such an easy rapport with Don Hastings and Kathy Hays, and Helen Wagner, and then eventually, after awhile with Eileen Fulton,&quot; she said.

===Awards===
Zenk has never received a Daytime Emmy for her work however was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in both 2002 and 2011. In 2001, she was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress.

==Storylines==
Barbara Ryan is first introduced to the Hughes family when her mother, Jennifer, marries Bob Hughes. Barbara is very happy for her mother and likes having Bob as a stepfather. Barbara has a fairly uncomplicated teenage life, but suffers from bulimia at age 16.

Barbara returns to town in 1978, having just graduated from art school and fleeing a failed romance with Steven Farrell. Unable to live without her, Steven follows her to Oakdale and gets a job in the cardiology department at Memorial. The couple rekindle their romance, but Steven has a secret past, one he cannot share with the woman he loved. The year ended on a sad note when, on the night Nancy Hughes was to give an engagement party for the happy couple, Steven leaves town, leaving Barbara to nurse a broken heart.

She then began dating her former stepbrother Tom Hughes. At about this time, Barbara began receiving mysterious phone calls. Soon, she was forced to confess a deep, dark secret—three years earlier Barbara had an affair with the aristocratic, very rich James Stenbeck, and became pregnant with his child. Believing he did not want to raise the child, whom she named Paul, she gave him to her friend Claudia Colfax to raise. Claudia&#x27;s husband, Raymond, proved to be an abusive man and, with Tom&#x27;s help, Barbara was able to secure custody of Paul. Just then, James came to Oakdale himself. Barbara resisted a romantic reunion with the dashing aristocrat and became engaged to Tom, but Stenbeck soon learned that he was Paul&#x27;s father and confronted her on her wedding day. Barbara tearfully left Tom at the altar and ran off to the Caribbean with James and they made plans to marry.

The Stenbeck fortune first became a problem for the couple when Charles Ivenstrom, whose daughter was pregnant by James&#x27; brother, tried to kill them so that his grandchild-to-be, rather than Paul, would inherit the money. Barbara was shot, but survived and she and James married in her hospital room. Following Charles&#x27; arrest, James&#x27;s brother accused James of marrying Barbara so James would have access to Paul&#x27;s inheritance. James assured Barbara that this was ridiculous. For Barbara, the marriage proved disastrous. Seeing nothing wrong with having a wife and a mistress, James began an affair with Margo Montgomery, Barbara&#x27;s private nurse. In addition, James decided to supplement his fortune by smuggling drugs and stolen jewelry through the fashion company he bought for Barbara. Finally, Barbara found out about the affair and the illegal activities. Though James was able to talk Barbara into giving their marriage a chance, it became clear that Barbara was becoming disenchanted.

At the same time she suspected that James was having another affair, this time with Dee Stewart, Barbara started having bizarre visions of a previous life. The visions consisted of a woman who looked just like her, named Bianca, who resided in Paris with her husband Jason (who looked remarkably like James). Bianca would later learn Jason was carrying on an affair with the maid, Daphne (who looked like Dee Stewart). Later, Barbara&#x27;s flashbacks started to have a mysterious blonde Englishman coming to Paris who, for some reason, was very angry with Jason. The mysterious blonde Englishman challenged Jason to a duel (with Jason getting the upper hand, at first). In the summer of 1982, Bianca (Barbara&#x27;s doppelganger) learned this mysterious blonde Englishman&#x27;s name, Geoffrey. Not long after, at the funeral of James&#x27;s brother, Lars, Barbara was shocked to see a man who looked exactly like Geoffrey: Gunnar St. Clair.

Gunnar surprised the Stenbecks by claiming to be James&#x27;s cousin. He produced records from the St. Clair orphanage showing that Greta Aldrin, James&#x27;s ex-nanny, brought him there after his parents died, because James&#x27;s father didn&#x27;t want him living in the same house. James ordered an investigation and was determined not to let Gunnar claim any rights to the Stenbeck fortune. In early September 1982, the Stenbecks were surprised when Gunnar showed up at the penthouse. Electrified by his presence, Barbara mistakenly called him Geoffrey. Later, at Fashions, Gunnar saw Barbara holding a blue dress and suggested that she buy it. Later, she had a vision of Bianca wearing a similar dress for Geoffrey. Whenever she wore the blue dress, Barbara felt loved. Barbara was convinced these visions were premonitions of the end of her marriage, and she was afraid of her attraction to Gunnar. Barbara headed for her cabin in Michigan to get away. When Barbara got into her car at the cabin, a masked man put a gun to her head. Barbara&#x27;s captors were Charles Ivenstrom, the man who had once ordered her death, and his daughter, Ingrid, the widow of James&#x27;s younger brother, Lars. Ingrid blamed Barbara and James for her husband&#x27;s death. Lars and James would have had to share the Stenbeck fortune, and Ingrid said Lars futilely begged James to keep him out of bankruptcy. Desperate, Lars got drunk and died in the hiking &quot;accident.&quot; In revenge, Ingrid vowed to kill Barbara, and her father, Charles, was helping her get back the money that was rightfully hers.

The kidnappers mistook Gunnar for James, and demanded $2 million in cash for Barbara. They insisted Gunnar make the drop, but captured him as he approached. Alone in a dark cellar, on Halloween Eve, Gunnar and Barbara declared their love. They escaped and hid in a nearby barn. As they slept, a little girl wandered in and told her parents, who contracted the police. James arrived to find Gunnar and Barbara sleeping in each other&#x27;s arms. Alone with Barbara, James accused her of having an affair with Gunnar, which she denied. Meanwhile, Gunnar found a painting of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Barbara/Bianca and bought it, telling Barbara the picture meant they were destined to be together. Then he proposed. Soon after, Barbara overheard John Dixon yelling at Dee that Barbara was a fool to stay married to the man who ran him down and who was having an affair with Dee. Shocked, she told James she and Paul were moving out. James&#x27;s attorney, Mr. Hoyt, warned James about losing control of the Stenbeck fortune. He begged Barbara to reconsider and warned that she and Gunnar would never get custody of Paul. Barbara ignored him and went to Switzerland with Gunnar, leaving Paul with her Aunt Kim and Kim&#x27;s husband, Nick. Meanwhile, the intensity of the visions was becoming much, with people noticing how distracting she was becoming. Finally Lisa, her partner in Fashions, suggested that Barbara see a psychiatrist, Dr. Ben Forrest.

This suggestion fell right into James&#x27;s plans for Barbara since he decided to use this as a means to get Barbara locked away so he&#x27;d get control of Fashions. Later, he was found dead in Australia. Afterwards, Barbara next set her sights on newspaperman Brian McColl. Soon, the couple fell in love and made plans to marry. Paul was vehemently against the marriage and caused trouble. Continually argumentative, at one point, Paul hit Brian several times and when Brian raised his hand, instinctively, to hit back, Barbara walked in and railed into Brian. Disgusted at Barbara&#x27;s tendency to let Paul dictate her life, Brian broke off the engagement. With the encouragement of her friend (and Brian&#x27;s former stepmother) Lisa McColl, Barbara tried to go to his place to take him back, only to find Shannon O&#x27;Hara in the room wearing Brian&#x27;s bathrobe. From that moment, Barbara vowed to no longer be victimized by men. Soon a different Barbara Ryan emerged. Later, Barbara attempted to seduce Tom Hughes, now married to Margo Montgomery (James&#x27;s former mistress). Though her attempt was unsuccessful, she did put a cramp in the Hughes marriage after lying to Margo that she and Tom had made love. Since Tom had been drunk on the day in question, he had no idea if it was true or not. When Tom &quot;confessed&quot; to Margo, she left town for several months, leaving Barbara free to comfort a heartbroken Tom.

At the same time, Barbara&#x27;s jealousy caused her to be a thorn in Shannon&#x27;s side when she decided to do some digging to get the dirt on Shannon. Her efforts paid off when she learned Shannon had a husband. Vindictively wanting to stop Shannon&#x27;s wedding to Brian, Barbara located Shannon&#x27;s husband, Duncan McKechnie, and brought him to Oakdale. Soon after, Barbara got the shock of her life: James was alive! He apparently had survived the fall out of the airplane with the use of a parachute. After his initial appearance, James was able to evade the police for weeks. In the meantime, Barbara bonded with the detective in charge of the case, Hal Munson. Around Hal, Barbara finally started loosening up and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, such as a hockey game and a can of beer. Eventually, James was apprehended and put on trial. However, with the help of Lucinda Walsh, he was exonerated. Like Barbara, Lucinda was only a means to an end.

While working at Walsh Enterprises, he started embezzling funds in order to regain his fortune. It didn&#x27;t take long though for the authorities to go after him again for illegal business dealings in Europe. On the run again, James blackmailed his ex-lover Emily Stewart into helping him escape and manipulated Paul into keeping his whereabouts secret. However, James couldn&#x27;t hide his dangerous nature from Paul for long and in order to spare John Dixon&#x27;s life, Paul agreed to go with his father. For James, the police were waiting for them. After a standoff in a cabin at Ruxton Hills, James apparently died in fire, his body burned beyond recognition. Although there were a slew of suspects, Barbara would end up being arrested when her gun was found to be the one that killed James and Tonio Reyes reported that he saw her enter the house right before he heard gunshots. For her own part, Barbara had no memory of the night and couldn&#x27;t defend herself. She was convicted of the crime and sent to jail. Luckily, she was exonerated when it was discovered that the body in the house wasn&#x27;t James; it was his accomplice whom James must have murdered to fake his death. Her ordeal over, Barbara married Hal in an elegant ceremony at Lakewood Towers. Soon after their marriage, Barbara figured out that Hal was Adam Hughes&#x27;s biological father, since she knew Tom was out of town when Margo apparently conceived, and knew about Hal &amp; Margo&#x27;s affair. Fearing losing Hal to Margo, Barbara decided to keep this a secret from Hal.

At the same time, a teenaged Paul was offered an internship at Montgomery &amp; Associates, something Barbara wouldn&#x27;t stand for since she didn&#x27;t want Paul working around James&#x27;s older lover, Emily. However, at this point, Emily accidentally learned about Margo&#x27;s true conception date and blackmailed Barbara into letting Paul work there—or she&#x27;d tell Hal the truth. In the end, Margo told Hal the truth. Shocked, Hal distanced himself from Barbara, as he tried to deal with the revelation. In the meantime, James resurfaced again and returned to Oakdale to retrieve his son. By now, James truly wanted Paul to be close to him and was disconcerted that Paul hated him. Lurking in the shadows, James learned of Paul&#x27;s affair with Emily. Disgusted by the affair, he decided to murder Emily. However, this time, Paul rescued the intended victim and shot his father dead. During the course of the trial, Paul and Emily kept the truth to themselves, leaving Barbara to believe that Emily killed James. Afterwards, the pair told the truth and Paul left town.

A few years later, tragedy struck when Jennifer was stricken ill with pneumonia which proved fatal. Though devastated, Barbara was strong and faced her daughter&#x27;s death with dignity. Tragedy struck again mere months later when Hal was killed in the line of duty. From that point on, Barbara focused her energies on her sons. To that end, she decided to grant Will and Gwen their fondest wish—a baby. Gwen had learned she was infertile and attempts at &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization (IVF) were unsuccessful. At the same time, Gwen&#x27;s brother&#x27;s girlfriend, Sophie, was expecting a baby who Cole Norbeck wanted no part of. Barbara decided the perfect solution was for Gwen to adopt Sophie&#x27;s baby and arranged a deal with Gwen&#x27;s mother, Iris, to buy Sophie&#x27;s baby. Knowing there was no love lost between Gwen and her brother, Barbara kept the identity of the birth mother a secret. Alison Stewart noted some similarities between the Munson&#x27;s adoption and Sophie&#x27;s and went to Barbara. Barbara lied that she would look into the matter and then tried to cover her tracks. Alison Stewart did some digging around and discovered the truth. She went straight to Will and Gwen who confronted Barbara. Though she denied it at first, she was forced to admit to it but insisted that she acted out of love. Will disowned his mother.

In the end, the Munsons did end up adopting Sophie&#x27;s baby whom they named Hallie Jennifer. Will refused to let Barbara attend the christening. In fact, he didn&#x27;t want her to be in Hallie&#x27;s life at all. Soon, Lisa asked Barbara if she was all right because Lisa had noticed that Barbara seemed to be having difficulty speaking. At Lisa&#x27;s suggestion, Barbara consulted her doctor and was horrified to learn that she had oral cancer. Though her doctor told her to tell her family about her condition, Barbara decided to keep it to herself. At this point, Will and Gwen were contending with Sofie, who wanted Hallie back, while Paul had just been injured in a car explosion and Barbara did not want to be a burden on her sons. After weeks of going through radiation alone, Barbara&#x27;s secret was discovered by Sophie when Sophie overheard Barbara make an appointment for treatment. At Sofie&#x27;s insistence, Barbara, finally, told her family about her condition. Although, Will and Gwen were poised to reconsider their move out of Oakdale, Barbara refused to let them put their lives on hold for her.

At this point, Paul invited Barbara to stay with him at Fairwinds. Sofie, who offered to take care of Barbara when Gwen and Will were gone and who had already befriended Paul, spent many hours at the mansion where Barbara discovered Sofie&#x27;s talent for jewelry design. Recognizing that Sofie had talent, Barbara and Paul decided to subsidize her new business venture. During this time, Paul and Sofie developed an attraction to each other and, one night, depressed about losing Meg, Paul slept with Sofie. Although both Barbara and Paul tried to tell Sofie that the fling meant nothing, the girl became obsessed with Paul. Worried about Sofie&#x27;s attraction to Paul, Barbara decided that Meg was the better choice and tried to convince Meg to reunite with Paul, and even hired Meg as her private nurse. As Paul and Meg got closer, Sofie&#x27;s obsession with Paul went to dangerous heights with her switching Barbara&#x27;s medication in an effort to get Meg into trouble. Though she almost died of an overdose, Barbara recovered and witnessed Paul&#x27;s proposal to Meg. Soon after being threatened by Barbara, Sofie mysteriously disappeared. Determined that her son be happy, Barbara led Paul and Meg to believe that her health was failing so they would get married ASAP. With only Barbara in attendance, Paul and Meg married near the rose garden at Fairwinds. That night, the police caught Paul transporting Sofie&#x27;s lifeless body and he was booked on murder charges. Meg insisted to Barbara that Paul was guilty and implied that he was covering up Barbara&#x27;s crime. Barbara denied murdering Sofie and, on her lawyer&#x27;s suggestion, enlisted Rick Decker&#x27;s help in proving Paul&#x27;s innocence.

Rick reported that whoever killed Sofie was a professional in the use of needles—leading Barbara to suspect Meg. Not long after, Barbara was visited by Hallie&#x27;s father, Cole Norbeck, who informed her that he saw her murder Sofie. Since she had been taking pain medication, Barbara couldn&#x27;t dismiss Cole&#x27;s claim that she killed Sofie in a drug induced stupor. It soon became clear that the reason Cole wanted money was to support his drug habit. After blackmailing Barbara for money, Cole got desperate and ultimately kidnapped her for ransom. It soon became clear that Cole, a drug user, had killed Sofie. Luckily for Barbara, she got the upper hand and knocked Cole out with his own drugs. Cole escaped but was apprehended by the police. James Stenbeck also returned to Oakdale in August 2008, and soon enough, Barbara had confronted him, learning he had stolen her money to get Paul to ask him for help and not her. Barbara then closed all of her accounts, liquifying the money and guaranteeing Paul that he would get the loan he asked for. In late September, James Stenbeck &#x27;died&#x27; after falling from a lighthouse on an island. It was also revealed that Dusty Donovan was still alive and well having been captured by James nine months previous.

At that time, Barbara went to New York for a business trip. She returned on November 10 and met up with Dusty, only to find he had met a girl that he thought resembled his late wife and Barbara&#x27;s daughter Jennifer. Barbara and Paul were completely insulted and left Dusty. The following year, Barbara learned shocking news—Henry Coleman was James’ illegitimate son. Shortly after this startling revelation, James was apparently killed and Henry was named heir to the Stenbeck fortune. Since Paul was uninterested in fighting for his inheritance, Barbara took it upon herself to make sure Paul got the inheritance that he deserved. However, Henry later seduced Barbara and then agreed to split the inheritance 50/50. Afterwards, Barbara was almost poisoned by Henry’s mother, Audrey. Luckily, Henry found out what his mother was up to and stopped Barbara from drinking the poison.

Later, the spector of James returned in the form of researcher Mick Dante. The much younger Mick was convinced that he was James Stenbeck. Though Mick tried to convince everyone that James had taken a youth serum developed by Dante, in reality, James had brainwashed Dante. After Dante turned himself in, Paul again declared that he wanted nothing from his father and gave the remainder of his fortune to Henry. Henry and Barbara fell into bed again and soon began relishing their commitment free affair. However, it didn’t take long for the pair to develop genuine feelings for each other. Unfortunately, Henry was torn between his feelings for Barbara and his newly returned, lover, Vienna. Vienna stunned Henry by proposing to him, and they made love. When Henry told Barbara about it, she dumped him. Though he was seemingly committed to Vienna, Henry kissed Barbara when he learned that she was cancer-free.

Afterwards, Barbara discovered that Vienna was trapping Henry into marriage by falsely claiming to be pregnant. Before she had a chance to interrupt the wedding, Barbara was chloroformed and held captive. Barbara’s captor turned out to be Gwen’s mother, Iris, who demanded bank codes from Barbara, and forced her to write a short note to ask her family to give her time alone. Upon seeing the note, Henry became convinced that Barbara had been kidnapped. Barbara discovered a walkie-talkie and somehow tuned the frequency to Jacob&#x27;s baby monitor. As she hoped, Henry heard the message when he was babysitting Katie’s baby. Iris then relocated Barbara to the wine cellar at Fairwinds. Emily stumbled upon Barbara in the wine cellar. Iris tied Emily up and insinuated to Will and Gwen that Emily was behind Barbara&#x27;s disappearance. Later, Henry caught Iris strutting around in Barbara&#x27;s clothes and deduced that Iris had kidnapped Barbara and Emily. The family smelled smoke at Fairwinds and rescued Emily and Barbara from the cellar. Gwen detained Iris at the Lakeview bar, and the police arrested Iris. Barbara suddenly wanted nothing to do with Henry, who&#x27;d chosen Vienna over her, but after a poignant talk with Katie, Barbara accepted Henry&#x27;s marriage proposal. Henry and Barbara received the cold shoulder when they announced their engagement to her sons, who were opposed to her marrying James Stenbeck&#x27;s son. Henry withdrew his proposal, but Barbara insisted that genes wouldn&#x27;t hold them back. When Paul learned that his mother had planned an impromptu wedding, he surprised the couple by gathering the family to witness the union. Later, Barbara decided to dissolve BRO so that she could concentrate on her new life with Henry.

==Character development and impact==

===Anthony Herrera&#x27;s return===
She also recalled the secrecy in the return of Barbara&#x27;s supposedly dead husband, James Stenbeck. It was also the first return-from-the-dead storyline the show tackled.
&quot;It was a shock for everyone in the production as well. They kept it so quiet. They eliminated the name “James” from every single script. Nobody knew he was coming back except Doug Marland and Bob Calhoun, our executive producer at the time. I was told the day before. The crew didn’t know. Obviously wardrobe did because they had to put him in the monk’s robe. They snuck him into the building, they snuck him on set, and it wasn’t until “Hello Barbara” that anyone knew James and Anthony [Herrera] were back. It was cool.&quot;

===Change in character===

In 1985, writer Douglas Marland stepped aboard the team, transforming the character of Barbara. Zenk recalls the change in character literally happened &quot;overnight.&quot;
&quot;I could never figure out what Doug saw. But when I look back at myself at that young age before Barbara turned into Bad Barbara, I can see some of that. I can see how he could say, “That girl could have an edge if I gave it to her.” We didn’t have a young bad girl on the show at that point. I think he positioned me perfectly for that.
&quot;Barbara was in the middle of everything - stirring the pot, making things happen, causing grief for everyone around her, making the same mistakes over and over. She found Hal, fell in love with him, and couldn’t figure out how to put that marriage first. The one thing I always loved about the character, that they never forgot, is that Barbara never learned from her mistakes.&quot;
However, when Marland died in 1993, Zenk said the character was under-utilized to the point that screen time for the character had effectively &quot;died.&quot;
“Barbara went so far off the back burner that she went off the stove.”

===Barbara under Hogan Sheffer===
Apart from her character&#x27;s romance with John Dixon, Zenk was rarely seen in for most of the 1990s. It wasn&#x27;t until head-writer Hogan Sheffer brought the character to the front burner yet again did audiences see Barbara again.
&quot;Hogan took one look at me and said, “What do you mean you’re not using this character? Look at the history of this character! Look at this actress, she looks okay! Let’s see what she can do.” So they looked at what I could do. He completely resurrected Barbara, and I became his muse.&quot;
&quot;I had so much fun, I can’t tell you. I had the time of my life with Hogan. When he left it nearly killed me. I was really upset. I didn’t think I would ever get back up to that level where he had me. I was wrong.
&quot;A lot of people felt Hogan destroyed the show because of the way he told story. I completely disagree. I thought he completely revived us and saved us from the chopping block all those years ago. We weren’t looking good there for awhile . He saved us, and he certainly saved Barbara, that’s for sure.&quot;
A pivotal storyline, running for one year, was Barbara&#x27;s deformity caused by a chemical explosion.

===Oral cancer===
In January 2008, Zenk brought her battle with oral cancer to the screen. Writers diagnosed Barbara with the disease, and Zenk said she felt it was her responsibility to get the message out about the illness.
&quot;So I made it my duty to get out there and talk as much as I can about oral cancer. The thing with oral cancer, and the reason so many people don’t know about it, is because there are not that many survivors.&quot;

===Cancellation of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;===
In December 2009, CBS decided to cancel &quot;As the World Turns&quot; after 54 years on air. Zenk, who had played Barbara for 32 years, said the show could have been saved if it was marketed better.

<text>The Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (UC Chile; ) is a traditional private university based in Santiago, Chile. It is one of the thirteen Catholic universities existing in Chilean university system and one of the two pontifical universities in the country, along with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso. Founded in 1888, it is one of Chile&#x27;s oldest universities.

Pontifical Catholic University of Chile has a strong and long-standing rivalry with Universidad de Chile, as they are both widely recognized as the most traditional and prestigious in the country, and one is Catholic and the other, secular. This rivalry also translates to sports, especially football.

==Campuses==
UC Chile has four campuses in Santiago and one campus in Villarrica. The campuses in Santiago are:
* Casa Central (in downtown Santiago)
* San Joaquín (in Macul Commune of Greater Santiago)
* Oriente (in Ñuñoa Commune of Greater Santiago)
* Lo Contador ( in Providencia Commune of Greater Santiago)

These four campuses have a total of 223,326.06 m2 constructed in a 614,569.92 m2 area. The Villarrica campus has 1,664 m2 constructed in a 2,362.5 m2 area.

==History==
UC Chile was founded on June 21, 1888, by the Archbishop of Santiago, to offer training in traditional professions (law) and in technological and practical fields such as business, accounting, chemistry, and electricity. Its first chancellor was Monsignor Joaquín Larraín Gandarillas, and at the very beginning, the university only taught two subjects, law and mathematics. Since it is a Pontifical University, it has always had a strong and very close relationship with the Vatican. On February 11, 1930, Pope Pius XI declared it a pontifical university, and in 1931 it was granted full academic autonomy by the Chilean government.

UC Chile is a private, urban, multi-campus university. It is one of the eleven Chilean Catholic universities, and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Rectors&#x27; Council (&quot;Consejo de Rectores&quot;), the Chilean state-sponsored university system. It is part of the Universities of the Rectors&#x27; Council of Chilean Universities, and although it is not state-owned, a substantial part of its budget is given by state transfers under different programs.

UC Chile&#x27;s 18 faculties are distributed through four campuses in Santiago and one regional campus located in southern Chile. The technical training centers affiliated with the university are: Duoc UC, the Rural Life Foundations, the Baviera Foundation, the Catechetical Home and the San Fidel Seminary. These centers carry out technical-academic extension activities in rural and agricultural areas. Other UC activities are a Sports Club, and a Clinical Hospital dependent on the Faculty of Medicine.

UC Chile&#x27;s Graduates of the School of Architecture (one of the most prominent in Latin America) have also made important contributions to the country with such work as the Central Building (&quot;Casa Central&quot;) of UC, and the National Library.

Two of its most important alumni are the Jesuit Saint Alberto Hurtado and Eduardo Frei Montalva, a Chilean president. Both of them studied in the School of Laws. Sebastián Piñera, former Chilean president, graduated from the university&#x27;s School of Economics.

In 2017 the university faced what has been called a &quot;wave of suicide&quot; among its students. During 2017 a total of four students have taken their lives up to October, the previous year two students committed suicide. Critics, including alumni, have written about the university&#x27;s &quot;lack of concern&quot; for the suicide of students, an attitude they contrast to the university&#x27;s staunch opposition to abortion. The student union of the university issued a communique expressing feelings of guilt over the issue and the need to take charge.

==Collaborations==
The Department of Industry and System Engineering is engaging Stanford Technology Venture Program of Stanford University on a collaboration on innovation and technology ventures.

In December 2011, the schools of engineering of PUC and the University of Notre Dame signed an agreement to establish a dual graduate degree in civil engineering and the geological sciences, which now extends to other departments in both schools.

In April 2013, UC Chile and the University of Notre Dame also signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen scholarly engagement and expand their long-standing relationships. The agreement establishes an exchange program in which faculty, doctoral students and university representatives from each institution will visit, work, study and collaborate with the other institution.

==World rankings==
UC ranks among the first 10 Latin-American Universities according to the Shanghai ranking, UC appears top in two subject rankings: it ranks around 101–150 in Economics and Management and around 151–200 in Mathematics

Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile has been ranked as the best university in Latin America by two of the world&#x27;s most prestigious University rankings, the QS World University Rankings (in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023) and the Times Higher Education University Rankings (2019 and 2020).

<text>Charlie Van Dyke (born Charles Leo Steinle; July 26, 1947) is a former radio disc jockey who is best known for his voice work on radio and television stations. He is recognized by his deep, booming voice.

Originally from Dallas, Van Dyke was working in major-market Top 40 radio, at local powerhouse KLIF, by the time he was 19. Bill Drake brought Van Dyke to his stable of stations, first in morning drive at CKLW in Windsor in 1968 and 1969, then to KFRC in San Francisco where he did morning drive in 1969 and 1970. Van Dyke later did mid-days, and eventually mornings, and was program director at Drake&#x27;s &quot;flagship&quot;, KHJ in Los Angeles. Other stops included WLS Chicago, WDGY Minneapolis, and WRKO Boston.

Van Dyke&#x27;s spoken-word record &quot;The Flag&quot; charted nationally, peaking at #116 in the &quot;Record World&quot; survey of June–July 1976. He appears as the narrator on Albert Brooks&#x27;s second comedy album, &quot;A Star Is Bought&quot; (1975), which includes &quot;Phone Call to Americans,&quot; a parody of patriotic spoken-word records.

Throughout most of the 1980s, he was a frequent guest host on &quot;American Top 40&quot;. He sub-hosted on 31 shows in all, including the first regular episodes from 1983 to 1988. He also served as the show&#x27;s announcer until 1988.

In the 1990s, he worked in radio from his home in Phoenix, Arizona. From 1998 to 2000, Van Dyke succeeded Robert W. Morgan in morning drive at KRTH in Los Angeles. He continues to work as a voice talent for television and radio stations, including KUSI-TV in San Diego, WABC-TV in New York City, KABC-TV in Los Angeles, and WVUE-DT in New Orleans. He previously worked for WOWT in Omaha, WBAL-TV in Baltimore, KPNX in Phoenix, WSB-TV in Atlanta, WUSA in Washington, D.C., WTVJ in Miami, WBTV in Charlotte, WTVT and WFTS-TV in Tampa/St Petersburg, WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, WVTM-TV and WBRC in Birmingham, WAVE in Louisville, WJBK in Detroit, WTVD in Durham, KPRC-TV in Houston, KDFW in Dallas/Fort Worth, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, and WAVY-TV in Hampton Roads.

In November 2017, Van Dyke became the imaging voice of Educational Media Foundation&#x27;s K-Love contemporary Christian music network, which is heard on more than 450 stations nationwide.

In 2011, Van Dyke&#x27;s son Christopher &quot;Brotha&#x27; Fred&quot; Frederick joined WKSC-FM in Chicago as a morning personality.

==Early life==
Born Anthony Reed in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, Davidson was abandoned in the trash at 18 months old, before being rescued by a white woman who became his adoptive mother. His parents changed his name to Thomas Davidson when they adopted him. He has two older siblings, Michael and Beryle. He and his family had moved from Colorado to Wyoming to Oregon by the time he was five years old.

His parents divorced when he was five years old, and his mother and the children moved to Washington, D.C. They later moved to Wheaton, Maryland, then the neighborhood of Rosemary Hills in Silver Spring, and then Takoma Park. He attended Rosemary Hills Elementary School, Sligo Middle School, and Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, in Bethesda, Maryland.

He continued performing in various comedy clubs throughout the Washington Metropolitan region, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. He opened concerts for Patti LaBelle, Starpoint, and Kenny G. He performed on a fundraising telethon for WHMM in 1987.

Davidson won an amateur stand-up competition at the Apollo Theater in 1987. Soon afterwards, he moved to North Hollywood, California, where he met Martin Lawrence, who lived in his building.

<doc id="707109" wikidata="Q105771308" url="?curid=707109" title="Lists of UK singles chart number ones">
<text>The UK Singles Chart is a weekly record chart which for most of its history was based on single sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom. Since July 2014 it has also incorporated streaming data, and from 10 July 2015 has been based on a Friday to Thursday week. As of 28 December 2023, 1420 singles have reached number one. The chart was founded in 1952 by Percy Dickins of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;), who telephoned 20 record stores to ask what their top 10 highest-selling singles were. Dickins aggregated the results into a top 12 hit parade, which was topped by &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; by Al Martino. &quot;NME&quot;″s chart was published each week in its eponymous magazine.

The sources, in accordance with the official canon of the Official Charts Company, are the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; chart from 1952 to 1960; the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart from 1960 to 1969; and the Official UK Singles Chart from 1969 onwards.

==Turnover of number ones==
The calendar year that has featured the most UK number ones is 2000, which featured 42 singles reaching the top spot; the year with the fewest number ones is 1952 with 1, followed by 2016 with 10. The act that has achieved the most number ones is American entertainer Elvis Presley, who has topped the chart 21 times (including 3 re-releases of songs that had previously been number ones) – Presley&#x27;s second number one, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, was the first single ever to debut at the top of the chart. The most successful band (and equal with Elvis based on unique songs) are The Beatles, who have achieved 18 number ones. The Beatles&#x27; first chart-topper, &quot;From Me to You&quot;, reached number one in May 1963, and their last in November 2023 – the longest span of number ones for any artist.

In the 1970s, the required number of sales needed to top the chart was roughly 150,000. During 1992, when few releases were reaching number one, sales of CD singles were low: songs needed to sell only 60–70,000 each week to remain at the top. In 2000, when turnover of number ones was high, tracks could often sell between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in a single week. UK chart commentator James Masterton remarked in 2003: &quot;When record sales are high, public interest in a song expires very quickly and this creates a need for ever more new product to take its place.&quot; Sales figures improved in 2008 and continued into the early 2010s, peaking in 2013, before declining over the next few years as audio streaming became popular. Eventually, streaming was incorporated into the sales chart.

<text>Omar Enrique Vizquel González (; born April 24, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Little O&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball shortstop. During his 24-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, Vizquel played for the Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, and Toronto Blue Jays. In Venezuela he played for Leones del Caracas. From 2014 to 2017, he was the Detroit Tigers&#x27; first-base, infield and baserunning coach. He was manager for the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League.

Widely considered one of baseball&#x27;s all-time best fielding shortstops, Vizquel won 11 Gold Glove Awards, including nine consecutive from 1993 to 2001. Among shortstops, his .9847 fielding percentage is the highest all-time, he is the all-time leader in games played, and the all-time leader in double plays turned. Vizquel tied Cal Ripken Jr.&#x27;s American League record for most consecutive games at shortstop without an error (95, between September 26, 1999, and July 21, 2000), since surpassed. Vizquel ranked as the all-time hits leader among players from Venezuela (2,877; 44th all-time) until May 12, 2021, when he was surpassed by Miguel Cabrera. Vizquel has third-most hits all time among shortstops, behind Derek Jeter and Honus Wagner. Vizquel is also the career sacrifice hits leader of the live-ball era.

At the time of his retirement, Vizquel was the oldest position player in the Major Leagues, and the only active position player with service time in the 1980s. He is one of only 31 players in baseball history to play in Major League games in four decades, and the only one who played shortstop. On May 7, 2012, Vizquel became the oldest player to play at shortstop in Major League history, surpassing Bobby Wallace, who played 12 games with the St. Louis Cardinals at the age of 44 in 1918.

Vizquel was the last active player in any of the major North American professional sports leagues to have played in the 1980s. Starting in 2020, various allegations of domestic abuse and sexual harassment emerged against him.

==Professional career==

===Seattle Mariners===
Vizquel started his career with the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League together with Tony Armas, Bo Díaz and Andrés Galarraga. He learned to switch hit from Bill Plummer who managed Vizquel with the Leones del Caracas, in 1986–87 and 1988–89, and coached and managed the Mariners. Originally signed by the Mariners as a non-drafted free agent in 1984, Vizquel made his Major League debut on April 3, 1989. Batting ninth in the lineup, he went 0-for-3 while making five assists, a double play and an error in a 3–2 loss to the Oakland Athletics. Three nights later, he collected his first career hit in the third inning against Storm Davis with a single, later scoring on a Darnell Coles double, although the Mariners lost 11–3 to the Athletics.

===Cleveland Indians===

At the end of the 1993 season, Vizquel was traded by the Mariners to the Indians for Félix Fermín, Reggie Jefferson, and cash. During Vizquel&#x27;s career in Cleveland, the Indians made it to the World Series twice, losing to the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and to the Florida Marlins in 1997. Vizquel is a lifetime .250 hitter in 57 postseason games.

Vizquel won nine consecutive Gold Gloves with the Mariners and Indians, starting with his first in 1993 with Seattle and continuing until 2001. Alex Rodriguez broke Vizquel&#x27;s streak and won the award in 2002. Vizquel won two additional Gold Gloves in 2005 and 2006 with the San Francisco Giants.

In 1999, Vizquel hit over .300 and scored 100 runs for the first time in his career, finishing the season with a .333 batting average and 112 runs scored for an Indians team that scored a league-leading 1,009 runs. Vizquel hit second in the line-up between lead-off man Kenny Lofton and third-place hitter Roberto Alomar in the most productive offensive line-up in Cleveland baseball history. This line-up also included power hitters Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez.

On August 5, 2001, Vizquel hit a three-run triple in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners to tie the game 14–14, capping a comeback from a 14–2 deficit. The Indians went on to win 15–14 in 11 innings, tying the record for the largest comeback win in history. Vizquel reached career highs in 2002 hitting 14 homers and 72 RBI, but his success was interrupted by the need for surgery on his right knee. He tied the 2002 All-Star Game 7–7 with an RBI triple in the eighth inning. As a result of his knee injury in 2002 and a follow-up operation, he appeared in only 64 games in 2003. In a game on May 27, 2003, Vizquel had a straight steal of home against the Detroit Tigers. He caught Tigers pitcher Steve Avery by surprise and made it home without a throw. Vizquel returned in 2004 to hit .291 in 148 games. At the end of the season, Vizquel was signed by the Giants as a free agent.

===San Francisco Giants===
On June 23, 2007, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame inducted Vizquel, along with former Giants outfielder Matty Alou, into its Hall of Fame during an on-field, pre-game ceremony. For the 13th and final time, Vizquel finished in the top ten in sacrifice hits, having 14 to finish 2nd along with John Maine behind Juan Pierre.

Vizquel underwent arthroscopic knee surgery on February 27, 2008. He started the 2008 season on the disabled list and played in his first game on May 10. Vizquel stole home for the second time in his career against Oakland Athletics pitcher Greg Smith on June 13.

Vizquel won the Hutch Award and the Willie Mac Award, and was a finalist for the Heart &amp; Hustle Award. Only two other players, Dave Dravecky and Craig Biggio, have won more than one of these awards, although Willie McCovey himself won the Hutch Award before having the Willie Mac Award named for him.

Vizquel was Greg Maddux&#x27;s 3,000th strikeout victim on July 26, 2005.

===Texas Rangers===

On January 21, 2009, Vizquel signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers and made the team&#x27;s major league roster. He served mainly as a backup middle infielder. In 62 games with the Rangers, he had 47 hits, 17 runs, 14 RBIs with a .266 batting average and a .660 OPS to go with 27 strikeouts and 13 walks. In each of the three positions (shortstop, third base, second base) he played with the team, he made no errors. He played 27 games at shortstop for 196.2 innings, making 32 putouts and 76 assists with 22 double plays turned; he appeared in 20 games at third base for 101 innings, having five putouts and 22 assists, while making 23 putouts and 49 assists at second base.

===Chicago White Sox===
On November 23, 2009, Vizquel agreed to a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox worth $1.4 million. After making the deal official, former shortstop and White Sox legend (and fellow Venezuelan) Luis Aparicio asked that his number 11 be temporarily &quot;unretired&quot; for Vizquel during the 2010 season, mostly due to the fact that White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén — like Vizquel and Aparicio, a Venezuelan shortstop — had rights to #13, the number Vizquel has worn through his career.

On May 25, 2010, Vizquel became the shortstop with the third most hits all time, behind Derek Jeter and Honus Wagner. On June 25, he hit his first home run of 2010, putting him on the short list of players who have hit home runs in four different decades (with Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, and Rickey Henderson). On November 2, 2010, Vizquel signed a one-year deal to remain in Chicago. On April 3, 2011, Vizquel hit a single for his 2,800th career hit. Despite being well into his forties, Vizquel was still regarded as one of the better defensive shortstops in the game and seen by his former White Sox teammates as one of the most physically fit.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

Vizquel signed a one-year minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays for the 2012 season. He made the team out of spring training, and made his first appearance on Opening Day, against his former club, the Cleveland Indians. His first start came on April 22, against the Kansas City Royals. Vizquel was ejected from a game against the Texas Rangers on May 1, arguing with the home plate umpire from the bench. Vizquel jokingly danced to mock the umpire before exiting the dugout. Vizquel hinted at retirement upon the conclusion of the 2012 season. Despite being 45 years of age and appearing in only five games at that point in the season with the Blue Jays, he stated, &quot;I feel excited about coming to the ballpark. Maybe not every day, because there are going to be some days you&#x27;re going to be sore. But I still feel I want to be here. I want to compete.&quot;

In a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 27, Vizquel hit his first two extra-base hits of the season, a double and triple. Vizquel became the third oldest player to hit a triple (behind Julio Franco and Nick Altrock) and became the oldest player in major league history to hit a double and a triple in the same game.

In the first game of a day-night doubleheader against the New York Yankees on September 19, Vizquel recorded his 2,874th career hit, passing Babe Ruth for 41st all-time.

In the final game of the 2012 season, Brett Lawrie wore a #17 jersey as opposed to his usual #13. This allowed Vizquel to wear #13 (the number he wore through most of his career) when he played his final game on October 3, 2012. Vizquel went 1-for-3, hitting a single in his last at-bat, the 2,877th hit of his career, moving him ahead of Mel Ott for 40th position on the all-time hits list. Vizquel retired after the season and was the last position player born in the 1960s, as well as the last to play in the 1980s, to retire.

==Coaching==

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
On January 30, 2013, Vizquel was hired by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to become a co-infield coach with Bobby Knoop, to replace Dick Schofield, whose contract was not renewed for 2013.

===Detroit Tigers===

On November 18, 2013, the Detroit Tigers named Vizquel as their new first-base coach, replacing Rafael Belliard. Under manager Brad Ausmus, Vizquel also served as the Tigers infield and baserunning instructor. Following the dismissal of Ausmus after the 2017 season, Vizquel interviewed for the vacant manager&#x27;s position, but was passed over in favor of Ron Gardenhire.

===Chicago White Sox===
In November 2017 Vizquel returned to the White Sox organization to manage their Class A-Advanced team, the Winston-Salem Dash. In December 2018 Vizquel was promoted to manage the White Sox&#x27; Class AA team, the Birmingham Barons. In 2019 Vizquel was let go by the Barons after an incident between him and a male employee which resulted in an MLB investigation.

===Toros de Tijuana===
On December 2, 2019, Vizquel was named as the new manager for the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. In July 2021, Vizquel left the team.

==Personal life==
Vizquel is active in community service, having served as an honorary spokesperson for &quot;Young Audiences&quot;, an arts education organization in Cleveland, and &quot;Schools Now&quot;, which raises funds through the sale of entertainment booklets. Following the 1999 Vargas mudslide disaster that killed 25,000 in his native Venezuela, Vizquel volunteered for the relief effort and helped raise over $500,000 for the cause. Vizquel has held various charitable events in downtown Cleveland such as Tribe Jam, where he and some other teammates get together with each other or with retired singers and sing some of their favorite songs.

His 2002 autobiography, &quot;Omar!: My Life on and Off the Field&quot;, which he co-wrote with Bob Dyer, spent four weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List. It was released in paperback in 2003.

Vizquel married Nicole Tonkin, a Seattle native, in 1992. They later divorced, and Vizquel married Blanca Garcia in July 2014.

===Feud with José Mesa===
A long-running and well-publicized feud erupted between Vizquel and former teammate and friend José Mesa. In 2002, following the publication of his autobiography, &quot;Omar! My Life On and Off the Field&quot;, Vizquel criticized Mesa&#x27;s performance in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series: &quot;The eyes of the world were focused on every move we made. Unfortunately, Jose&#x27;s own eyes were vacant. Completely empty. Nobody home. You could almost see right through him. Not long after I looked into his vacant eyes, he blew the save and the Marlins tied the game.&quot; Mesa reacted furiously, pledging to hit Vizquel upon every subsequent opportunity: &quot;Even my little boy told me to get him. If I face him 10 more times, I&#x27;ll hit him 10 times. I want to kill him.&quot;

On June 12, 2002, Mesa hit Vizquel with a pitch in the ninth inning. Mesa was not ejected and finished the game. They did not face each other again until 2006; by then, Vizquel was with the San Francisco Giants and Mesa was playing for the Colorado Rockies. When Vizquel came to bat against Mesa in Denver on April 22, Mesa hit him again. Meeting three more times in 2006, however, Vizquel escaped being hit by his former teammate, with two groundouts and an RBI single. Vizquel batted .333 (7-for-21) against Mesa before Mesa&#x27;s retirement in 2007.

=== Domestic abuse allegations ===
On December 16, 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; reported that Vizquel&#x27;s wife Blanca (who was filing for divorce) alleged that he physically abused her in 2011 (which was before their marriage) and in 2016. Blanca previously made the allegation in an Instagram live video on October 7, 2020. According to &quot;The Athletic&quot;, in 2016, Vizquel was charged with fourth-degree domestic assault after an incident at their Seattle-area home in Sammamish, Washington. Blanca told police that her husband pushed her during an argument, causing her to fall and suffer an injury to her shin and multiple broken fingernails. Charges were later dropped at her request. She claimed in the article that Vizquel coerced her into signing the letter and threatened her with financial retribution. &quot;The Athletic&quot; also mentioned an incident in December 2011, when Vizquel allegedly strangled his wife during an argument at her sister&#x27;s home in Alabama. He denied the allegation and claimed that Blanca scratched him, which she denies. The couple ultimately filed a successful joint motion to dismiss charges.

In a statement, Vizquel strongly denied the allegations against him. MLB investigated the situation.

===Sexual harassment lawsuit===

&quot;The Athletic&quot; reported on August 7, 2021, that Vizquel and the White Sox were being sued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama by a Birmingham Barons batboy who alleged that Vizquel sexually harassed him, targeting him because of his autism. Vizquel and the plaintiff reached a confidential settlement in June 2022.

Vizquel has appeared on balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame since 2018, when he received 37.0% of the vote, well short of the 75% required for election, but well above the 5% minimum required to remain on the ballot. His support increased to 52.6% in 2020 before going down to 49.1% in the 2021 ballot and then cratering to 23.9% in the 2022 ballot, his fifth year on the ballot before going down to 19.5% on his 6th year of eligibility in 2023. In 2024, his 7th year, he received 17.7% of votes, decreasing by 1.8% from his previous year. A player may appear on the regular ballot, voted on by members of the BBWA, a maximum of ten times, although there are opportunities to get elected to the Hall by other means, as MLB has committees staffed by former ballplayers who can elect someone previously overlooked.

<text>Rory Cochrane (born February 28, 1972) is an American actor. He is known for playing Ron Slater in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, Lucas in &quot;Empire Records&quot;, Lee Schatz in &quot;Argo&quot;, Freck in &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, and Tim Speedle in &quot;&quot;.

==Career==
Cochrane&#x27;s first roles included a part in a docudrama about drugs on &quot;Saturday Night with Connie Chung&quot; (1989) and an appearance in an episode of &quot;H.E.L.P.&quot; (1990). He then made his film debut (with about fifteen seconds&#x27; screen time) in &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot;, followed by his first substantial role as Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s son in &quot;Fathers &amp; Sons&quot;.

Cochrane&#x27;s breakout role came when he was cast as stoner Ron Slater in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, a film that &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked #3 in their &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot; of all-time. Cochrane followed up with a well-received performance as the psychotic Billy Mack in the Renée Zellweger action/comedy &quot;Love and a .45&quot; in 1994. Cochrane again found success with a major role in the comedy &quot;Empire Records&quot; and appeared in &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; starring Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell. He also appeared in the Richard Linklater film &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006).

Cochrane played the role of CSI Tim Speedle in &quot;&quot; seasons 1–3. Cochrane also reprised his role in the season 6 episode &quot;Bang, Bang, Your Debt&quot;, as a hallucination to Eric Delko.

In 2015, Cochrane had a supporting role as Boston mobster Stephen Flemmi in the true-crime film &quot;Black Mass&quot;, which starred Johnny Depp.

<doc id="707122" wikidata="Q854905" url="?curid=707122" title="Monsignor">
<text>Monsignor (; ) is a form of address or title for certain members of the clergy in the Catholic Church. Monsignor is the apocopic form of the Italian &quot;monsignore&quot;, meaning &quot;my lord&quot;. &quot;Monsignor&quot; can be abbreviated as Mons. or Msgr. In some countries, the title &quot;monsignor&quot; is used as a form of address for bishops. However, in English-speaking countries, the title is unrelated to the episcopacy, though many priests with the title later become bishops.

The title &quot;monsignor&quot; is a form of address, not an appointment (such as a bishop or cardinal). A priest cannot be &quot;made a monsignor&quot; or become &quot;the monsignor of a parish&quot;. The title &quot;Monsignor&quot; is normally used by clergy who have received one of the three classes of papal honors:

* Protonotary apostolic (the highest honored class)
* Honorary prelate
* Chaplain of His Holiness (the lowest honored class)

The pope bestows these honors upon clergy who:
* Have rendered a valuable service to the church
* Provide some special function in church governance
* Are members of bodies such as certain chapters

Clerics working in the Roman Curia and the Vatican diplomatic service are eligible for all three honors. Priests working in a diocese are only eligible for the &quot;Chaplain of His Holiness&quot; honor. Priests must be nominated by their bishop and (for appointments after 2013) must be at least 65 years old.

==Current honor rules==

=== Current honor classes ===
Pope Paul VI, in his 1968 publication &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Pontificalis Domus&quot;, reduced the number of papal honors allowing &quot;Monsignor&quot; as a style from 14 to three. The protonotary apostolic class was divided into two subsections. The classes of chamberlains and chaplains were abolished, leaving only a single class of &quot;chaplains of his holiness&quot;. The three papal honor classes are:
* Protonotary apostolic (two subclasses):
** &quot;De numero&quot; (the higher and less common form)
** Supernumerary (the highest grade of monsignor found outside the Vatican)
* Prelate of Honour of His Holiness (formerly the &quot;domestic prelate&quot;)
* Chaplain of His Holiness (formerly the &quot;supernumerary privy chamberlain&quot;)

=== Current honor eligibility ===
In March 2013, Pope Francis suspended the granting of papal honors, with the title of monsignor, to all clergy except members of the Vatican diplomatic service. However, by 2022 the title had started to be awarded again.

At the October 2013 meeting of the Council of Cardinal Advisers, Pope Francis stated his desire to scale back the honors as part of a broader effort to project a more modest and pastoral vision of leadership. As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis never requested papal honors for his priests, associating the honors with clerical &quot;careerism&quot;.

In December 2013, Pope Francis decreed that diocesan priests could become &quot;Chaplain of His Holiness&quot;, the lowest of the three papal honors. He also set a minimum age required of 65. Existing honors were not affected. Pope Francis decided to continue papal honors from all three classes for two groups of clergy:

* Officials of the Roman Curia
* Members of the diplomatic service.

=== Current forms of address ===

These are the current forms of address for a monsignor:

* The written form is &quot;Monsignor (first name) (last name)&quot; or &quot;The Reverend Monsignor (first name) (last name)&quot;. For example, &quot;Monsignor Bob Smith&quot; or &quot;The Reverend Monsignor Bob Smith&quot;.
* The spoken form is &quot;Monsignor (last name)&quot;. For example, &quot;Monsignor Smith&quot;.

In English-speaking countries, bishops and archbishops are not called &quot;monsignor&quot;. However, in 1969 the Vatican Secretariat of State indicated that bishops may be addressed as &quot;monsignor&quot;. In some countries, the titles &quot;Monsignore&quot;, &quot;Monseigneur&quot;, &quot;Monsenyor&quot;, and &quot;Monseñor&quot; are used for bishops, archbishops and any other prelates below the rank of cardinal or patriarch.

The 1969 instruction also indicated that for bishops &quot;Reverendissimus&quot; (translated as &quot;most reverend&quot;) could be added to the word &quot;monsignor&quot;. For example, the &quot;Most Reverend Monsignor John Doe&quot;. This instruction also applied to:

* Prelates without episcopal rank who head offices of the Roman Curia 
* Judges of the Rota 
* The promotor general of justice and the defender of the bond of the Apostolic Signatura
* Protonotaries apostolic &quot;de numero&quot; 
* The four clerics of the camera.

=== Current ecclesiastical dress ===

In 1979, the Vatican simplified the dress of monsignors:

==== Chaplains of His Holiness ====
Purple-trimmed black cassocks with purple sashes, good for all occasions.

==== Honorary prelates ====
Red-trimmed black cassocks with purple sashes, good for all occasions. Purple cassocks as choir dress for liturgical events of special solemnity.

==== Supernumerary protonotaries apostolics ====
Red-trimmed black cassocks with purple sashes. Purple cassocks as choir dress. Can also wear the purple &quot;ferraiuolo&quot;, a silk cape. The ferraiuolo is for non-liturgical events, such as graduation and commencement ceremonies.

==== Protonotaries apostolics &quot;de numero&quot; ====
Red-trimmed black cassocks with purple sashes and the purple &quot;ferraiuolo&quot;. Purple cassocks as choir dress. They can wear the mantelletta in choir dress with a black biretta with a red tuft.

==Previous honor rules==
=== Previous honor classes ===
The Catholic church originally maintained 14 classes of papal honors. A priest with the title of &quot;privy chamberlain&quot; would lose the title when the pope who granted it died. When the pope abolished the privy chamberlain class in 1968, the rule was abolished also. These 14 previous classes included:

* Domestic prelates 
* Four kinds of protonotaries apostolic, 
* Four kinds of papal chamberlains, and at least 
* Five types of papal chaplains.
The 14 honor categories were reduced to three categories in 1969.

=== Previous age requirements ===
Under Pope Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum qualifications of age and priesthood for the three papal honor classes:

* Chaplains of his holiness – minimum age 35 and 10 years as priest
* Honorary prelates – minimum age 45 and 15 years as priest
* Protonotaries apostolic supernumerary – minimum age 55 and 20 years as priest

The Secretariat waived the minimum-age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as honorary prelates. The reasoning was that as long as a priest holds the office of vicar general, he is also protonotary apostolic supernumerary. A vicar general could not be named chaplain of his holiness. All these criteria were superseded in 2013.

=== Previous forms of address ===
* Priests with the title &quot;Chaplain of His Holiness&quot; were formerly addressed in English as &quot;The Very Reverend Monsignor&quot;. 
* Priests with the titles &quot;Protonotary Apostolic&quot; or honorary prelate were addressed as &quot;The Right Reverend Monsignor&quot;.

These forms were changed in 1969.

==Other monsignors==
Under the legislation of Pope Pius X, vicars general and vicars capitular (now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries &quot;durante munere.&quot; As long as these priests hold the office, they can have the title &quot;monsignor&quot;. Vicars general and diocesan administrators were allowed to wear:

* A black, silk-fringed sash (fascia)
* Black piping on the biretta with a black tuft 
* A black mantelletta

As a result of this they were in some countries referred to as &quot;black protonotaries&quot;. However, &quot;Pontificalis domus&quot; of Paul VI removed this position (titular protonotaries) from the Papal Household, even though the title of &quot;monsignor&quot;, which is to be distinguished from a prelatial rank, has not been withdrawn from vicars general, as can be seen, for instance, from the placing of the abbreviated title &quot;Mons.&quot; before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;.

<doc id="707124" wikidata="Q1721507" url="?curid=707124" title="Kairyū-class submarine">
<text>The was a class of midget submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy, designed in 1943–1944, and produced from the beginning of 1945. These submarines were meant to meet the invading American naval forces upon their anticipated approach of Tokyo.

==History==
More than 750 of these midget submarines were planned and by August 1945 about 210 had been manufactured. Most of them were constructed at the Yokosuka shipyard. These submarines had a two-man crew and were fitted with two torpedoes along with a explosive charge intended to be used on a suicide mission.

Most of the &quot;Kairyu&quot; submarines were based at Yokosuka to defend the entrance of Tokyo Bay in the event of a United States invasion of mainland Japan. Some of these subs were also stationed in the Moroiso and Aburatsubo inlets on the southern tip of the Miura Peninsula where a training school had also been set up.

Due to Japan&#x27;s surrender in August 1945, none of these submarines ever saw action.

==Technical details==

All members of the Kairyu class were constructed from 3 sections of welded steel bolted together. The sections were the fore (warhead), mid (diesel engine, ballast, fuel, controls and batteries) and finally the aft (motor and control planes).

The bow section could be installed with or without a warhead, followed by the forward trim tank.

Following on from the bow was the central section, first in this section was the batteries for the electric motor and the air flasks. Next was the pilot area. He would have numerous controls including controls for the fore and aft dive planes and rudders, valves for oil, fuel and water and the periscope raise/lower controls. Behind the pilot would be the main ballast tank and fuel tank.

Abaft the fuel tank and ballast tank in the aft section was an in-line six diesel engine, followed by the aft trim tanks, gearbox and reduction motors and finally the electric motor and propellers.

In the conning tower there was usually a Type 4 magnetic compass however some early models had a Type 97 gyrocompass in the boat itself.

===Modification 3===
While both the original and second modifications were practically identical, the third modification of the class had some notable differences.

The overall length was longer. The forward dive planes were moved forward of the conning tower. There was no external magnetic compass and the fuel tank was installed before the pilot&#x27;s control area. There was also a second periscope aft of the conning tower.

This model could very well have been used for training purposes with a complement of 3.

==Survivors==
A Kairyū-class submarine, cutaway to show interior details, is on display at the US Navy Submarine School at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut. It has been there since at least the mid-1960s. Another is known to survive at the Yamato Museum, fully intact.

<doc id="707132" wikidata="Q684055" url="?curid=707132" title="Testament of Solomon">
<text>The Testament of Solomon is a pseudepigraphical composite text ascribed to King Solomon but not regarded as canonical scripture by Jews or Christian groups. It was written in the Greek language, based on precedents dating back to the early 1st millennium AD, but was likely not completed in any meaningful textual sense until sometime in the Middle Ages. In its most noteworthy recensions, the text describes how Solomon was enabled to build his temple by commanding demons by means of a magical ring that was entrusted to him by the archangel Michael.

== Dating and authorship ==
Scholarly opinion on when the Testament of Solomon was written varies widely. Suggested dates for its composition range between the end of the 1st century AD and the High Middle Ages. Also disputed is whether it had a Christian or Jewish origin. Mid-twentieth century scholarship tended to agree that much of its content &quot;reflects the first-century Judaism in Israel&quot; and includes material much earlier than its composition.
However, scholars both before (e.g., Istrin) and after (e.g., Schwarz) proposed other solutions based upon the varied manuscript evidence. Because of the text&#x27;s various forms, produced over centuries by distinct scribes, the author or authors of the text remain unknown. The text was originally written in Greek and contains numerous theological and magical themes ranging from Christianity and Judaism to Greek mythology and astrology that possibly hint at a Christian writer with a Greek background.

== Contents ==

When a demon named Ornias harasses a young man (who is favored by Solomon) by stealing half of his pay and sucking out his vitality through the thumb on his right hand, Solomon prays in the temple and receives from the archangel Michael a magic ring with the seal of God (in the shape of a pentagram) on it which will enable him to command the demons. Solomon has the young man throw the ring at the demon Ornias, which stamps him with the seal and brings him under control. Then Solomon orders the demon Ornias to take the ring and similarly imprint the prince of demons, Beelzebul.

With Beelzebul under his command, Solomon now has all of the demons at his bidding to build the temple. Beelzebul reveals that he was formerly the highest ranking angel in Heaven.

In chapter 18, the demons of the 36 decans appear, with names that sometimes seem to be conscious distortions of the traditional names for the decans. The decan demons claim responsibility mostly for various ailments and pains, and they provide the magical formulae by which they may be banished. For example, the thirty-third demon is Rhyx Achoneoth who causes sore throat and tonsilitis and can be driven off by writing the word &quot;Lycourgos&quot; on ivy leaves and heaping them into a pile.

Solomon&#x27;s final demon encounter involves sending a servant boy with his ring to take captive a wind demon who is harassing the land of Arabia. The boy is to hold a wineskin against the wind with the ring in front of it, and then tie up the bag when it is full. The boy succeeds in his task and returns with the wineskin. The imprisoned demon calls himself Ephippas, and it is by his power that a cornerstone, thought to be too large to lift, is raised into the entrance of the temple.

Then Ephippas and another demon from the Red Sea bring a miraculous column made of something purple (translation obscure) from out of the Red Sea. This Red Sea demon reveals himself as Abizithibod, and claims to be the demon who supported the Egyptian magicians against Moses, and who hardened the pharaoh&#x27;s heart, but had been caught with the Egyptian host when the sea returned and held down by this pillar until Ephippas came and together they could lift it.

There follows a short conclusion in which Solomon describes how he fell in love with a Shunammite woman, and agreed to worship Remphan and Moloch in exchange for sex. Solomon agrees to sacrifice to them, but at first only sacrifices five locusts by simply crushing them in his hand. Immediately, the spirit of God departs from him, and he is made foolish and his name becomes a joke to both humans and demons. Solomon concludes his text with a warning to the readers; he tells them to not abandon their beliefs for sex like he did.

In the Testament of Solomon, the firmament is conceived in a tripartite structure and demons are portrayed as being capable of flying up to and past the firmament in order to eavesdrop on the decisions of God.

== Christian themes ==
The most explicit and notable Christian theme found in the text was during King Solomon&#x27;s encounter with the demon Ephippas. While working on the temple, Solomon asks Ephippas by what angel he is thwarted. The demon replied that the only thing that can truly take away his powers and defeat him is a man that will be born of a virgin and then be crucified on a cross by the Jews.

== Greek influence ==
The most obvious Greek influence is Solomon&#x27;s encounter with seven demons who are sisters. They introduce themselves to the king and describe their home among the stars and Mount Olympus. The seven demon-sisters represent the Pleiades of Greek mythology and their astrological relationship.

Solomon also encounters a female demon called Obizuth, who has no limbs and a head full of disheveled hair. It is argued that she actually represents Medusa or a gorgon-like creature from Greek mythology.

The demon Enepsigos recounts to King Solomon at one point during the temple&#x27;s construction that he can take three different physical forms, one of which being the Greek Titan Kronos. Enepsigos is also represented as a triple-faced woman akin to Hecate and is likewise astrologically associated with the sphere of the moon.

== Similarity to Jewish tradition ==
The Babylonian Talmud (in Gittin 68) mentions a similar story where Solomon enslaves Ashmedai, a demon prince, to build the Temple, and he was disposed of temporarily by him.

== Demons ==
Many of the demons in Solomon&#x27;s encounters are of Greek, Egyptian, Jewish, Christian, Arabic, and other traditions. The majority of the testament consists of Solomon&#x27;s interviews with the demons, some of which are grotesque, including one which has no head. Two demons associated strongly with sexuality appear among them- Asmodeus from the Book of Tobit, and a female demon named Obyzouth, who has similarities to Lilith, such as killing newborn children. Most of the other demons are otherwise unknown by name from other works. The demon Abezethibou is said to have hardened the pharaoh&#x27;s heart, rather than God.

The demons, listed in order of appearance, are Ornias, Beelzebub, Onoskelis, Asmodeus, Tephras, the 7 star sisters (a reference to the Pleiades), Envy, Rabdos, Rath, Tribolaios, Obizuth, the wingdragon, Enêpsigos, Kunopaston, an unnamed &quot;lustful spirit&quot;, the 36 spirits of the decans, Ephippas, Abezethibou.

<text>The Molecular Foundry is a nanoscience user facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, and is one of five Nanoscale Science Research Centers sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. 

==Overview==
The Molecular Foundry was founded in 2003. The building was completed on March 24, 2006. The current director, Kristin Persson, was appointed in 2020, following permanent directors Jeff Neaton (2013–2019), Omar Yaghi (2012–2013) and Carolyn Bertozzi (2006–2010).

Users of the Molecular Foundry are provided with free access to instruments, techniques and collaborators for nanoscience research that is in the public domain and intended for open publication. Proposals for user projects are aimed to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in the areas of materials science, physics, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, biology and chemistry.

==Facilities==

The foundry includes these seven facilities:
* Imaging and Manipulation of Nanostructures, led by Facility Director Alex Weber-Bargioni and founded by Miquel Salmeron. 
** Characterization and manipulation of nanostructures—from &quot;hard&quot; to very &quot;soft&quot; matter—combining electron microscopy, optical microscopy and scanning probe microscopy.
* Nanofabrication, led by Facility Director Adam Schwartzberg and founded by Jeff Bokor. 
** Advanced lithography and thin-film processing emphasizing integration with chemical and biological nanosystems and the development of nanoscale electronic, magnetic and photonic devices.
* Theory of Nanostructured Materials, led by Facility Director David Prendergast and founded by Steven Louie.
** Theoretical support to guide understanding of new principles, behavior and experiments—including electrical transport in nanoscale molecular junctions, self-assembly of biological nanostructures and computation of spectroscopy at hybrid nanoscale interfaces.
* Inorganic Nanostructures, led by Facility Director Jeff Urban and founded by A. Paul Alivisatos.
** The science of semiconductor, carbon and hybrid nanostructures—including design and synthesis of nanocrystals, nanowires and nanotubes—and study of their electronic applications.
* Biological Nanostructures, led by Facility Director Corie Ralston and founded by Carolyn R. Bertozzi.
** New materials based on the self-assembly of biopolymers and bio-inspired polymers, new probes for bio-imaging and synthetic biology techniques to re-engineer organisms and create hybrid biomolecules to interface with devices.
* Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis, led by Facility Director Yi Liu and founded by Jean Fréchet.
** Studies of &quot;soft&quot; materials — including synthesis of organic molecules, macromolecules, polymers and their assemblies, with access to functional systems, photoactive, organic-inorganic hybrid and porous materials.
* National Center for Electron Microscopy, led by Facility Director Andy Minor. NCEM was founded in 1983 as an independent DOE user facility and merged with the Molecular Foundry in 2014.
** Use and development of an array of electron microscopes, offering capabilities for materials characterization at high resolution.

== User program ==
The Molecular Foundry has a user program that gives access to the center&#x27;s staff and equipment to external researchers who intend to publish their results. The program is open to scientists from academia, industry, and research institutes. The application process for the user program involves submitting a peer-reviewed proposal.

<text>Michael James Hall (born February 20, 1982, in Glen Ellyn, Illinois) is an American sports broadcaster who works for the Big Ten Network. He can also be found as a sideline reporter for National Football League (NFL) games on Fox. Hall is a graduate of the University of Missouri where he majored in journalism.

==Biography==

===&quot;Dream Job&quot;===
Hall is perhaps best known for being the winner of the first season of ESPN&#x27;s reality television show &quot;Dream Job&quot;. For his efforts, Hall won a one-year contract to be an anchor on ESPN&#x27;s popular sports news program &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and a new Mazda 3. On the night that he won, March 28, 2004, Hall also took a sports quiz to raise his salary. His salary started at $70,000. He then answered five trivia questions, each correct answer worth $5,000, to bump his first-year salary to $95,000.

===ESPN===
On May 15, 2004, Hall graduated from the University of Missouri. At 1 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 20, 2004, Hall began his stint as an official &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor alongside Linda Cohn, having already done some work for ESPNews. Before Missouri, he attended historic Glenbard West High School. Hall also appeared on ESPN, and occasionally ESPN2, broadcasting college games including the Division I NCAA Frozen Four National Championship. He used to be the featured on-air personality at ESPN&#x27;s network devoted to college sports, ESPNU. On March 4, 2005, he was the opening promo for the first ever program on ESPNU, a basketball game at Gallagher-Iba arena on the campus of Oklahoma State University (OSU) between OSU and Texas. ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; reported during its &quot;Happy Trails!&quot; segment on April 27, 2007, that Hall was leaving ESPNU to move back to the Chicago area, where he would pursue other job opportunities.

===Big Ten Network and Fox Sports===
Beginning in 2007, Hall is employed with the Big Ten Network. While at the network, Hall has hosted signature programs including Big Ten football pregames/halftimes/postgames, &quot;Friday Night Tailgate&quot;, &quot;Big Ten Football Report&quot;, &quot;BTN Live&quot; on Sirius/XM satellite radio, &quot;Big Ten Basketball &amp; Beyond&quot; and Big Ten Basketball pre-game, halftime, and wrap-up segments.

Hall also makes appearances doing sideline reporting for &quot;The NFL on Fox&quot;. as well as for the network&#x27;s coverage of the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

In 2016 the network gave Hall his own late night comedy show, &quot;Sports Lite&quot;. It was a sports twist on &quot;The Soup&quot; where he did a monologue in front of a live studio audience, and aired feature pieces with him in the field showing athlete&#x27;s goofing off with him, as well as utilizing comedians in NYC and LA interviewing famous Big Ten fans.

===Improv comedy===
Hall performed improv comedy at iO Chicago for more than a decade with various teams including Wonderbat (co-starring SNL&#x27;s Alex Moffat), Electric Mayhem, and Coup de Grace and at The Playground with Boyish. He frequently would be seen showing up at Second City to do guest performances during the improv sets.

<text>The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago is a contemporary art museum near Water Tower Place in the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. The museum, which was established in 1967, is one of the world&#x27;s largest contemporary art venues. The museum&#x27;s collection is composed of thousands of objects of Post-World War II visual art. The museum is run gallery-style, with individually curated exhibitions throughout the year. Each exhibition may be composed of temporary loans, pieces from their permanent collection, or a combination of the two.

The museum has hosted several notable debut exhibitions, including Frida Kahlo&#x27;s first U.S. exhibition and Jeff Koons&#x27; first solo museum exhibition. Koons later presented an exhibit at the museum that broke the museum&#x27;s attendance record. The current record for the most attended exhibition is the 2017 exhibition of Takashi Murakami&#x27;s work. The museum&#x27;s collection, which includes Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Kara Walker, and Alexander Calder, contains historical samples of 1940s–1970s late surrealism, pop art, minimalism, and conceptual art; notable holdings also include 1980s postmodernism, as well as contemporary painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation, and related media. It also presents dance, theater, music, and multidisciplinary arts.

The current location at 220 East Chicago Avenue is in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area. Josef Paul Kleihues designed the current building after the museum conducted a 12-month search, reviewing more than 200 nominations. The museum was initially located at 237 East Ontario Street, which was originally designed as a bakery. The current building is known for its signature staircase leading to an elevated ground floor, which has an atrium, the full glass-walled east and west façades giving a direct view of the city and Lake Michigan.

==History==

The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago was created as the result of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, collectors and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city&#x27;s Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in &quot;Time&quot;. It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970, he invited Wolf Vostell to make the &quot;Concrete Traffic&quot; sculpture in Chicago.

Initially, the museum was conceived primarily as a space for temporary exhibitions, in the German &quot;kunsthalle&quot; model. However, in 1974, the museum began acquiring a permanent collection of contemporary art objects created after 1945. The MCA expanded into adjacent buildings to increase gallery space; and in 1977, following a fundraising drive for its 10th anniversary, a three-story neighboring townhouse was purchased, renovated, and connected to the museum. In 1978, Gordon Matta-Clark executed his final major project in the townhouse. In his work &quot;Circus Or The Caribbean Orange&quot; (1978), Matta-Clark made circle cuts in the walls and floors of the townhouse next-door to the first museum.
In 1991, the museum&#x27;s Board of Trustees contributed $37 million ($ million today) of the expected $55 million ($ million) construction costs for Chicago&#x27;s first new museum building in 65 years. Six of the board members were central to the fundraising as major donors: Jerome Stone (chairman emeritus of Stone Container Corporation), Beatrice C. Mayer (daughter of Sara Lee Corporation founder Nathan Cummings) and family, Mrs. Edwin Lindy Bergman, the Neison Harris (president of Pittway Corporation) and Irving Harris families, and Thomas and Frances Dittmer (commodities). The Board of Trustees then weighed architectural proposals from six finalists: Emilio Ambasz of New York; Tadao Ando of Osaka, Japan; Josef Paul Kleihues of Berlin; Fumihiko Maki of Tokyo; Morphosis of Santa Monica, Calif.; and Christian de Portzamparc of Paris. According to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin, the list of contenders was controversial because no Chicago-based architects were included as finalists despite the fact that prominent Chicago architects such as Helmut Jahn and Stanley Tigerman were among the 23 semi-finalists. In fact, none of the finalists had made any prior structures in Chicago. The selection process, which started with 209 contenders, was based on professional qualifications, recent projects, and the ability to work closely with the staff of the aspiring museum.
In 1996, the MCA opened its current museum at 220 East Chicago Avenue, which was the site of a former National Guard Armory between Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue from 1907 until it was demolished in 1993 to make way for the MCA. The four-story building designed by Josef Paul Kleihues, which was five times larger than its predecessor, made the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago the largest institution devoted to contemporary art in the world. The physical structure is said to reference the modernism of Mies van der Rohe as well as the tradition of Chicago architecture. The museum opened at its current location June 21–22, 1996, with a 24-hour event that drew more than 25,000 visitors.

==Exhibitions==
===Past===
In its first year of operation, the museum hosted the exhibitions, &quot;Pictures To Be Read/Poetry To Be Seen,&quot; &quot;Claes Oldenburg: Projects for Monuments,&quot; and &quot;Dan Flavin: Pink and Gold&quot;, which was the artist&#x27;s first solo show. In 1969, the museum served as the site of Christo&#x27;s first building wrap in the United States. It was wrapped in more than of tarpaulin and rope. The following year, it hosted one-person shows for Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol.

The MCA has also played host to the first American and solo exhibitions of prominent artists, such as Frida Kahlo, in 1978. Other exhibition highlights include the first solo museum shows of Dan Flavin, in 1967, and Jeff Koons, in 1988. In 1989, the MCA hosted &quot;Robert Mapplethorpe, The Perfect Moment,&quot; a traveling exhibition organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia.

===Recent===
In 2006, the MCA was the only American museum to host Bruce Mau&#x27;s &quot;Massive Change&quot; exhibit, which concerned the social, economic, and political effects of design. Additional 2006 exhibitions featured photographers Catherine Opie and Wolfgang Tillmans as well as Chicago-based cartoonist Chris Ware. The 2008 Koons retrospective broke the attendance record with 86,584 visitors for the May 31 – show of September 21, 2008. This was the culminating exhibit of the 2008 fiscal year, which celebrated the 40th anniversary of the museum.

In 2009, the MCA presented Jeremy Deller&#x27;s exhibition &quot;It Is What It Is: Conversations About Iraq&quot;. The exhibition was organized by the New Museum, and it was a new commission by the New Museum, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles.

Co-organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Wexner Center for the Arts, the MCA presented &quot;Luc Tuymans&quot; from October 2010 – January 2011. &quot;Susan Philipsz: We Shall Be All&quot; was presented at the MCA February – June 2011. The Turner Prize-winning artist&#x27;s sound exhibition featured protest songs and drew from Chicago&#x27;s labor history. The exhibition &quot;Eiko &amp; Koma: Time is Not Even, Space is Not Empty&quot; was the first series of stage performances and a gallery exhibition presented at the MCA. The Japanese-born choreographers and dance artists performed and exhibited from June – November 2011.

In 2014, the MCA was the only US venue to mount the &quot;David Bowie Is...&quot; exhibition, which broke previous attendance records for the museum. To date, the most attended exhibition is the 2017 &quot;Takashi Murakami: The Octopus Eats Its Own Leg&quot; exhibit, which broke the &quot;David Bowie Is...&quot; record set in 2014 with over 193,000 attendees.

Following &quot;David Bowie Is...&quot;, the MCA debuted the critically acclaimed exhibition &quot;Kerry James Marshall: Mastry&quot; in 2016. &quot;Mastry&quot; later traveled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2017, the MCA curated a show by the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami which set attendance records, and in 2019, the museum launched a mid-career retrospective for the work of the American designer Virgil Abloh, a sometime collaborator of Murakami&#x27;s.

In 2020, the MCA opened &quot;Duro Olowu:Seeing Chicago&quot;, a curated exhibition by Duro Olowu of over 350 artworks from Chicago which marked the first time the museum had hired a guest art curator.

In 2022, the MCA presented &quot;Nick Cave: Forothermore&quot;, the Chicago artist’s first career-spanning retrospective.

===Recurring programs===
After a 10-year run, the exhibition series &quot;UBS 12x12: New Artists/New Work&quot; is moving from the second floor to the third floor, into a larger gallery space and will change its name to &quot;Chicago Works&quot;. The exhibition series will still feature Chicago-area artists. Rather than each artist being displayed for one month, each exhibition in the series will now be displayed for three months.

Starting in 2002, the MCA began commissioning artists and architects to design and construct public art for the front plaza. The goal of the program is to link the museum to its neighboring community by extending its programmatic, educational, and outreach functions. While artists have been exhibited intermittently on the MCA plaza since 2002, the summer 2011 plaza exhibit showcasing four works by Miami-based sculptor Mark Handforth marks a revitalization of the plaza project.

From October through May, the MCA hosts monthly &quot;Family Days&quot;, which feature artistic activities for all ages. Each summer, the museum hosts &quot;Tuesdays on the Terrace&quot;, a jazz performance series, and a Farmers Market on the MCA plaza on Tuesdays from June through October. Year round, the MCA offers a Tuesday evening series, &quot;In Progress&quot;, that explores the creative process, in addition to a Friday evening series led by local artists in the museum&#x27;s public engagement space, the Commons.

==Performance==
The MCA Stage has featured local, national, and international theater, dance, music, multimedia, and film performances. It is known as the &quot;most active interdisciplinary arts presenter in Chicago&quot; and partners with local community organizations for the co-presentations of performing arts.

Notable MCA Stage appearances include performances by Mikhail Baryshnikov, eighth blackbird, Peter Brook, Marie Chouinard, Merce Cunningham, Philip Glass, Martha Graham, Akram Khan, Taylor Mac, and Twyla Tharp.

In September 2022, the MCA Stage hosted the first annual &quot;Chicago Performs&quot;, a two-day festival of experimental dance, music, and theater that included admission to the museum and other related programs. The festival spotlighted three local artists whose multi-disciplinary performance pieces were shown within the museum in a series of ticketed and non-ticketed performances.

Every spring, MCA presents an annual suite of live, digital, and durational performance works in its &quot;On Stage&quot; series. Both &quot;Chicago Performs&quot; and &quot;On Stage&quot; are yearly programs at the Museum.

== Building ==
The five-story limestone and cast-aluminum structure was designed by Berlin architect Josef Paul Kleihues. The building, which opened in 1996, contains of gallery space (seven times the space of the old museum), a theater, studio-classrooms, an education center, a museum store, a restaurant-café, and a sculpture garden. The MCA building was Kleihues&#x27;s first American structure. Its construction cost US$46.5 million ($ million today). The sculpture garden, which is , includes a sculptural installation by Sol LeWitt and sculptures by George Rickey and Jane Highstein. The floor plan of both the building and the sculpture garden is a square, on which the proportions of the building is based.

The building&#x27;s main entrance, which is accessed by scaling 32 steps, uses both symmetry and transparency as themes for its large central glass walls that compose the majority of both the east and west façades of the building. Two additional entrances—into the education center and into the museum store—are located on either side of the main staircase. The monumental staircase with projecting bays and plinths that may be used as the base for sculpture is reminiscent of the Propylaia of the Acropolis of Athens. The main level entry hall has an adjacent atrium that connects it to a restaurant in the rear of the building. Two galleries for temporary exhibitions flank the atrium. The stairwell in the northwest corner is often cited as the buildings most interesting and dynamic artistic feature. The elevated views of Lake Michigan are considered to be a rewarding feature of the building. The building&#x27;s glass facade sits atop of Indiana limestone. The building is known for its hand-cast aluminum panels adjoined to the facade with stainless steel buttons. The building has two two-story gallery spaces and a smaller one-story gallery space on the second floor. The third floor has a gallery and exhibition space in its northwest section, and the fourth floor has two large galleries, an exhibition space on the west side of the building, and a gallery in the southwest section.

The museum has a 296-seat multi-use theater with a proscenium-layout stage. The seats are laid out in 14 rows with two side aisles. The stage is and elevated above the floor level of the first row of seats. The house has a 12 degree incline. The stage has three curtains and four catwalks. For its 50th anniversary in 2017, the museum unveiled a $16 million renovation by architects Johnston Marklee, which redesigned within the existing footprint of the original Joseph Paul Kleihues design.

In 2017, the MCA commissioned architects Johnston Marklee to redesign select public spaces of the museum to create three major offerings: Marisol, the ground-floor destination restaurant with an immersive art environment by international artist Chris Ofili; a social engagement space called the Commons on the second floor with an installation by Pedro y Juana; and a new third floor with classrooms and a flexible meeting space that puts learning at the very center of the museum. This major $16-million renovation converted of interior space and coincided with the MCA&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

===Critical review===
Complaining that the structure has a more fortress-like exterior than the museum&#x27;s earlier home, Kamin viewed the architectural attempt as a fumbled work. However, he considered the interior to be serene and contemplative in a manner that complements the contemporary art and compact and organized in a manner that is an improvement on the more traditional mazelike museums. Comparing the building to the Sullivan Center and the Art Institute of Chicago Building, Kamin describes the museum as an homage to two of Chicago&#x27;s architectural influences: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Sullivan. Other critics also note the presence of Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s spirit in the architecture.

Chicago-based architect Douglas Garofalo has described the building as stark, intimidating and &quot;incongruous with contemporary sensibilities&quot;. The interior atrium, which the architect claims links the city to the lake is part of a transcendent space that benefits from the sunlight that enters through the high glass walls. The building is said to be designed to separate the art from other distracting services and functions of the venue. Kamin was also pleased with the separate entrances on the main floor for the museum store and accessibility entrances.

== Mission and vision ==
MCA’s mission statement describes itself as “an innovative and compelling center of contemporary art where the public can experience the work and ideas of living artists, and understand the historical, social, and cultural context of the art of our time.” In keeping with the museum’s vision of a creative and diverse future, MCA is a leader in collecting works by historically underrepresented artists “with rates more than twice the national average for the work of women (25 percent of acquisitions), four times the national average for Black American artists (almost 10 percent), and seven times the national average for the work of Black American female artists (3.6 percent).”

Announced by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in June 2011, the MCA initiated the process of reinventing its identity with new curators, a new floor plan, and a new vision. MCA Director Madeleine Grynsztejn stated the museum sought to be 50/50 artist-activated/audience-engaged. The main floor&#x27;s north and south galleries present exhibitions showcasing the museum&#x27;s permanent collection and work by post-emerging contemporary artists. The third floor is for the &quot;Chicago Works&quot; series. The fourth floor has gallery spaces for the &quot;MCA Screen&quot; and &quot;MCA DNA&quot; series, while the main barrel-vaulted galleries is for special exhibitions.

==Collection==
The museum&#x27;s collection consists of about 2,700 objects, as well as more than 3,000 artist&#x27;s books. The collection includes works of art from 1945 to the present.

Former MCA Chief Curator Elizabeth A. T. Smith provided a narrative of the museum&#x27;s collection. She says the collection has examples of late surrealism, pop art, minimalism, and conceptual art from the 1940s through the 1970s; work from the 1980s that can be grouped under postmodernism; and painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation, and related media current artists explore.

<text>WCKX (107.5 FM), known on air as &quot;Power 107.5&quot;, &quot;Power 107,” or simply “Power” is a radio station broadcasting a hip hop-leaning urban contemporary format. The station is licensed to and serves the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. It first began broadcasting in 1993 under the call sign WJZA. The station is currently owned by Radio One, and highly influenced by the BlackPlanet social networking site. The station serves as the sister station to WHTD. Its studios are located just north of downtown, but the transmitter is located &quot;in&quot; downtown atop the Borden Building. The two station carries the syndicated The Morning Hustle with Kyle and L’Oreal, weekdays from 6 to 10 a.m, as well as Posted on the Corner with Incognito and DJ Misses from 7 p.m to midnight.

==Station history==
WCKX was originally assigned the WJZA call sign on November 23, 1993. On December 29, 1997, the WCKX call sign assigned to 106.3 MHz (&quot;Power 106&quot;) in London, Ohio (now WJYD) was reassigned to 107.5 FM, while the WJZA call sign was dropped and later picked up by 103.5 FM in Pickerington (&quot;Smooth Jazz 103.5 FM&quot;).

Since 2014, WCKX competes directly with iHeartMedia&#x27;s urban WZCB.

On November 28, 2017, at 10 a.m., WCKX began simulcasting with sister station WBMO, and rebranded as &quot;Power 107.5/106.3&quot;. On November 1, 2024, WCKX dropped the simulcast with sister station WHTD, and reverted back to simply being &quot;Power 107.5&quot;.

<text>WWLG (107.1 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Circleville, Ohio, and serving the Columbus metropolitan area. Branded as &quot;La Mega&quot;, the station is owned by Urban One and broadcasts a combination Spanish AC/Regional Mexican format.

WWLG&#x27;s effective radiated power (ERP) is 6,000 watts. The transmitter site is on Ringgold-Fairfield Road in Circleville.

==Station history==
In 1965, the station signed on the air as WNRE, which stood for the young owner&#x27;s name, Nelson Embry. At the time, the station broadcast from a small downtown Circleville studio with a very low power signal. The transmitter was later moved to its present location on a hill along State Route 159 northeast of Circleville.

In the mid-1980s, the station adopted the Z-Rock syndicated hard rock format before changing format and call letters to WLRO with the slogan &quot;Lady Radio&quot;, featuring programming geared specifically towards women. That was short lived, and in 1989, the station was changed to &quot;Classic Hits 107.1&quot;, with a classic hits format. In the early 1990s, it was WTLT &quot;The Light&quot;, playing a contemporary Christian format.

In 1993, 107.1 flipped to a simulcast of WAKS (105.7 FM)&#x27;s rhythmic CHR format, first as &quot;Hot 105/107&quot;, then as contemporary hit radio &quot;105.7/107.1 Kiss FM&quot;. In April 1994, the &quot;KISS-FM&quot; branding and format moved exclusively to 107.1, becoming &quot;The New 107.1 Kiss FM&quot;.

In January 1995, after teasing a &quot;major announcement&quot; for about a week, 107.1 flipped to 1970s music as &quot;Arrow 107.1&quot;, complimenting 105.7 once again.

Arrow ended in 1996 and 107.1 then became active rock &quot;107.1 The Big Wazoo&quot;. The station complimented its sister station WLVQ, which had a classic rock format. This name and format would broadcast on 107.1 until January 8, 2007, at 8p.m., when WAZU flipped to country as &quot;Wink 107.1&quot;. &quot;Wink&quot; debuted with Big &amp; Rich’s &quot;Comin&#x27; to Your City&quot; followed by Brooks &amp; Dunn’s &quot;Play Something Country&quot;.

On April 1, 2013, the country format of Wink was merged with K95&#x27;s format and became &quot;K95 at 107.1&quot; with a classic country format, changed shortly after to &quot;K107.1&quot;.

At 12:00 a.m., on November 13, 2015, the station flipped to a simulcast of WXMG, as Radio One had purchased WHOK-FM and sister WZOH-FM from Wilks. WHOK then flipped to urban gospel as &quot;Joy 107.1&quot; on November 16 at 5:00 p.m. The station changed its call sign to WJYD on November 23, 2015.

On November 1, 2024, the station would flip to a Spanish AC/Regional Mexican format, simulcasting La Mega Media owned WWLA under a new arrangement between Urban One and the company; the company had also filed for new callsign WWLG with the move. The &quot;Joy&quot; format would move to WHTD.

<text>Wing Commander is a 1999 science fiction film loosely based on the video game series of the same name. It was directed by Chris Roberts, the creator of the game series, and stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard, Saffron Burrows, Tchéky Karyo, Jürgen Prochnow, David Suchet, and David Warner.

Principal photography took place in Luxembourg in 1998 and post-production was done in Austin, Texas. The film was released on March 12, 1999 to critical and commercial failure, grossing just shy of $11.6 million. The film was the second on-screen collaboration with Lillard and Prinze Jr. after &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, who both later worked in the first two &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; films and &quot;Summer Catch&quot;.

==Plot==
In 2654, an interstellar war rages between the Terran Confederation and the Kilrathi Empire. The cat-like Kilrathi seek the complete eradication of the human race.

A massive Kilrathi armada attacks Pegasus Station, a remote but vital Confederation base, and captures a navigation computer, through which it locates Earth. Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn recalls the Terran fleet to defend Earth, but expects it to arrive two hours too late. Tolwyn orders Lieutenant Christopher Blair, whose father he knew from a previous conflict called the Pilgrim Wars, to carry orders to the carrier TCS &quot;Tiger Claw&quot; in the Vega Sector, under the command of Captain Jason Sansky, to fight a suicidal delaying action to buy the needed time.

Lieutenants Blair and Todd Marshall are pilots fresh out of training, traveling aboard the small supply ship &quot;Diligent&quot;, commanded by Captain James Taggart, to their new posting aboard the &quot;Tiger Claw&quot;. En route, the ship is pulled into a gravity well and loses its navigation computer. While Taggart repairs it, Blair space-jumps them to safety, calculating the jump in under ten seconds. Taggart notes that Blair outperformed the computer.

Along with the awkwardness of joining a new unit, and continual pranks that require discipline from his wing commander Lieutenant Commander Jeanette Deveraux, Blair fights the distrust of Commander Paul Gerald and his crewmate Lieutenant Ian St. John because of the drastic orders he brings from the Admiral, and because his mother was a &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, a strain of humans who were the cause of the Pilgrim Wars. Pilgrims were the first human explorers and colonists and had developed the innate ability to navigate space by feel despite obstacles such as black holes. Marshall finds a kindred spirit in Lieutenant Rosie Forbes and falls in love with her, but she dies when her fighter is damaged after a battle with an advance group of Kilrathi vessels and crashes on the flight deck during landing as the result of friendly competition with Marshall. The incident enrages Deveraux and shakes Marshall&#x27;s confidence.

Despite several setbacks, the &quot;Tiger Claw&quot;&#x27;s personnel successfully attack and board a Kilrathi communications ship with the &quot;Diligent&quot;. In the attack, they find the stolen navigation computer and learn the coordinates the Kilrathi fleet will use to approach Earth. The &quot;Tiger Claw&quot;, however, is heavily damaged and can do nothing more to prevent the assault, except to send Deveraux and Blair in fighters to find their way back to Earth. While it would normally be impossible for fighters to make such a jump without a navigation computer, Blair&#x27;s Pilgrim heritage enables him to calculate the jump himself. If alerted to the Kilrathi&#x27;s plans, Earth forces can destroy each Kilrathi ship before it gets its bearings after the space-jump; if not, Earth&#x27;s defenses will surely be overwhelmed. Before Blair leaves, Taggart, who is in reality a Naval Intelligence officer, reveals himself to be a Pilgrim as well, shocking Blair.

Deveraux&#x27;s fighter is disabled in combat after destroying a missile, but she convinces Blair not to rescue her but to continue his mission. Blair uses his Pilgrim sense to jump to the vicinity of Earth. As his fighter begins to run out of fuel, he transmits the information Earth needs to defeat the Kilrathi assault. He is pursued through the jump by the Kilrathi command ship, but his position lets him bait the Kilrathi into the gravity well he encountered at the start of the movie. He pulls his fighter away at the last minute but the command ship is pulled in due to its larger mass. Unprepared, the Kilrathi fleet is destroyed by the Earth fleet without a fight. A Rescue and Recovery pilot from the Earth fleet rescues Blair while Taggart rescues Deveraux in the &quot;Diligent&quot;. Blair and Deveraux are reunited on the &quot;Tiger Claw&quot; and share a kiss as Deveraux is taken to get medical attention.

==Production==
In late 1997 Digital Anvil, the entertainment company founded by &quot;Wing Commander&quot; creator Chris Roberts, acquired the live action feature film rights to the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series from Electronic Arts.

Roberts acknowledged the questionable quality of prior video game adaptations, but felt confident the cinematic quality of the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series as well as his experience directing the live-action scenes in &quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot; would serve him in adapting the property to feature film. In order to stretch the film&#x27;s budget, Roberts limited the film&#x27;s setting to the interiors of the spaceships with filming predominantly done on two sound stages in Luxembourg which Roberts said was done to evoke similar feelings of claustrophobia felt in &quot;Das Boot&quot;. As the film served as something of a prequel to the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; games, Mark Hamill was deemed too old to reprise his role as Blair. The producers had planned on having Malcolm McDowell reprise his role as Admiral Tolwyn, but McDowell became unavailable due to commitments to the &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; remake. In order to be released prior to &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, the crew needed to truncate the production schedule from the planned 10 to 12 months down to six months with Digital Anvil&#x27;s initial plan of producing all the effects shots themselves adjusted so certain effects could be farmed out to third party effects houses.

Freddie Prinze Jr. later said, &quot;I can&#x27;t stand Wing Commander. I can&#x27;t watch one scene of that movie... I read the script and loved it. So did my buddy Matthew Lillard. We both got the parts. We went on location and they said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s the new script&#x27;. It was a piece of crap.&quot;

==Relations to other &quot;Wing Commander&quot; works==
The film has been criticized by some fans for altering the visual style of the most recent &quot;Wing Commander&quot; games. The most notable shift between the games and the movie is the appearance of the Kilrathi. Although the movie&#x27;s Kilrathi retain feline facial characteristics, they lose their signature fur entirely. Roberts has since said that this change was a result of his ongoing unhappiness with the appearance of the &#x27;live&#x27; Kilrathi, none of which lived up to his internal vision. He had previously re-imagined the Kilrathi between &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;, going so far as to completely redesign the Melek character between the two games. Roberts, even after production of the film, was left unsatisfied with the results of the film version of the Kilrathi; some interviews imply that the puppets were built before the sets were completed, and were too large to be filmed without hunching over unnaturally.

Several changes in character backgrounds and nationalities were also made, as well as plot and name changes. The &#x27;pilgrim&#x27; story is new to the film, although there is some resemblance to the borderworlders of &quot;Wing Commander IV&quot;. The carrier&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Tiger Claw&quot;, rather than &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot;. The visual appearance of the ships also changed radically; the Rapier fighters featured in the film were built from scrapped English Electric Lightning jet fighter fuselages.

Roberts cast actors that bore little physical resemblance to those who previously held the part. Paladin went from being a thin fair-haired man in &quot;Wing Commander I&quot; &amp; &quot;II&quot; (voiced by Martin Davies) to being a large dark-haired Scotsman in &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot; (played by John Rhys-Davies) to having a French accent in the movie (played by Karyo).

&quot;Wing Commander Arena&quot;, the latest game in the series, makes reference to the movie, including references to the Pilgrim War, while using ships and settings which first appeared in the main series of games. The manual Star*Soldier does make references to some of the ships from the movie however showing them in silhouettes.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to &quot;Wing Commander&quot; was negative. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Novelization==
The novelization of the film by Peter Telep was fairly faithful to the film, but in the book the plot to discredit Blair is more far-reaching and includes David Suchet&#x27;s character, Captain Jason Sansky. There is also more general information about the Kilrathi and their first attack on a space station. The novel is based on the film&#x27;s shooting script, which includes most of this information. Significant cuts removed the &#x27;traitor&#x27; subplot from the finished film, since it heavily involved the unimpressive Kilrathi puppets. Admiral Bill Wilson was to be the traitor that compromised the Pegasus station (there were a number of scenes between Wilson and Bokoth, the commander of the Kilrathi battle group). In addition, Wilson provoked a knife fight on board the Kilrathi ConCom between Blair and Commander Gerald. Gerald wounded Blair, but everyone came to their senses and Blair used his Pilgrim Cross knife to kill Admiral Wilson (the only surviving element of this in the film is that Blair has a bandage on his hand during the scene where Paladin gave Blair his Pilgrim Cross). Also, Sansky was to commit suicide rather than be captured as a traitor; since all of his &#x27;traitor&#x27; scenes were removed, the film now implies that Sansky died from head injuries he received during battle.

<doc id="707152" wikidata="Q7957784" url="?curid=707152" title="WJYD">
<text>WJYD (106.3 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to London, Ohio, United States, and featuring a urban gospel format known on air as &quot;Joy 106.3&quot;. Owned by Urban One, the station serves the Columbus metropolitan area.

The studios and offices are on East First Avenue, just north of downtown. The transmitter is off London-Lockbourne Road in London.

==History==
The station was first licensed on May 26, 1993, as WCKX. When WCKX moved from 106.3 in London to 107.5 in Columbus on December 26, 1997, the call letters were changed to WMXG. The station became WCZZ on October 2, 1998. When 106.3 was known as WCKX, it was the Columbus area&#x27;s only R&amp;B and Hip Hop station, yet suffered from poor ratings because of its tower location in London, since the primary signal coverage reached only the western fringes of Franklin County and put secondary coverage into the remainder of the Columbus metropolitan area. The former WJZA at 107.5 became huge competition for &quot;Power 106.3&quot; in the late 90s and was eventually bought by Radio One and transferred to the 107.5 signal. In July 2000, the station flipped to urban gospel, branded as &quot;Joy 106.3,&quot; with the WJYD calls adopted on July 31 of that year. On September 16, 2011, the station became the new home of WXMG&#x27;s Urban AC format, and rebranded as &quot;Magic 106.3.&quot; On September 23, WJYD changed its call letters to WXMG.

On November 13, 2015, WXMG began simulcasting on WZOH-FM after Radio One purchased it and WHOK-FM from Wilks Broadcasting, as Radio One announced they would be moving the &quot;Magic&quot; format to the new frequency.

<text>Cherry Hood is an Australian artist, best known for her oversized paintings of children&#x27;s faces.

== Biography ==
Cherry Alexandra Hood was born in Sydney in 1950, and is the great granddaughter of Australian photographer, Sam Hood. She attained a Master of Visual Art at Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney in 2000. Her thesis investigated gender politics in art and culture, cultural mores and taboos surrounding the representation of the male body. Hood had countless solo and group shows while at university in artist-run spaces and is now represented and shows regularly At Tim Olsen Gallery in Sydney, Heiser Gallery in Brisbane, Arc One Gallery in Melbourne. Her works have been collected by most major institutions in Australia and many corporate and private collections. Hood has had solo shows in New York, Zurich, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver.

Hood prefers to work in watercolour, which she allows to bleed and drip, to produce her oversized paintings. Hood specialises in intense depictions which are most frequently anonymous composites with their own identities and not portraits of any actual person. She has become well known for her haunting, large-scale images of young boy&#x27;s faces.

Hood won the 2002 Archibald Prize for her portrait &quot;Simon Tedeschi Unplugged&quot;. In 2001 she was an Archibald Prize finalist with her water colour of art lecturer Matthÿs Gerber, in 2007 she was again a finalist with her water colour of Australian artist and social commentator Ben Quilty, and in 2010 with her portrait of &quot;Michael Zavros&quot;. In 2003 Hood won the Kedumba Drawing Award for her graphite, coloured pencil, watercolour drawing named &quot;Joshua&quot;.

== 2002 Archibald Prize win ==
It was a photograph picture of Australian pianist Simon Tedeschi that first caught Cherry Hood&#x27;s eye. She went to one of his concerts, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and then asked him to sit for her. &quot;Although I don&#x27;t normally do portrait/likenesses of people, I usually paint boys or adolescent males,&quot; she says. &quot;Simon is only 20 and he has large pale blue eyes which you can almost see through, his look suits the way I make images. The eyes are always the focus of my paintings. I want them to reflect the gaze of the viewer and I am interested in the way his pale eyes both reflect light and have a differentiation between the pupil and iris. I met him and found he is particularly empathetic, easy going and very sensitive artistically. He saw my work and he understood what I was doing.&quot;

Hood decided to paint him topless because, she says, &quot;he is always portrayed in formal clothes and often with a piano as well. Images of him are usually more about his playing than about him as a person let alone him as a sensual body. Also, at that time I was finishing a series of huge portraits of boys for my next exhibition. Simon saw these works and agreed to pose for me in the same way.

:&quot;It was quite easy to portray him because he has strong characteristics. I think it does look like him, if not at his most rested. He keeps up a rigorous international performance schedule and lives between Sydney and London. He was suffering jet lag or in &#x27;post concert letdown&#x27; when he sat for this painting. When he last saw the work he said, &#x27;love the whiskers, remind me to stop over in Bangkok next time.&quot;&#x27;

She received a prize of $35,000 Australian dollars.

== Illustrations ==
Cherry Hood illustrated JT LeRoy&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Harold&#x27;s End&quot; with a series of her distinctive portraits as well as pictures of Harold, the pet snail whose name gives the book its title. In the Acknowledgements LeRoy wrote, &quot;This is the first of what I hope will be a very long collaboration between us. Our next book is titled &quot;Labor&quot;.&quot;

<text>Nils Andreas Boe (September 10, 1913 – July 30, 1992) was an American attorney who served as the 23rd Governor of South Dakota from 1965 to 1969. He served as a judge of the United States Customs Court, later the United States Court of International Trade.

==Early life and education==

Boe was born in Baltic in Minnehaha County, South Dakota. He was the youngest son of Lutheran minister Nils N. Boe (1861–1938) and Sissel Catherine Finseth (1874–1960), both immigrants from Norway. He received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1935 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was a member of the track team, and received a Bachelor of Laws in 1937 from the University of Wisconsin Law School. Boe served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Career==

Boe was later elected to the state legislature representing Sioux Falls from 1953 to 1958. In 1962, following the state&#x27;s primary elections, Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum was appointed by Governor Archie M. Gubbrud to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by Francis H. Case&#x27;s death. Bottum&#x27;s appointment created both a vacancy in the lieutenant governorship and in the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor in the 1962 elections. At a state convention on July 16, 1962, Boe was named as the replacement lieutenant-gubernatorial nominee. Several days later, Governor Gubbrud appointed Boe to fill the vacancy in the lieutenant governorship, and Boe was sworn in on July 20. He was re-elected later that fall.

In 1964, when Governor Gubbrud declined to seek a third term, Boe ran to succeed him. Upon his victory, Boe, who was unmarried, was South Dakota&#x27;s only bachelor governor. His sister, Borghild Marie Boe (1906-1994), served as the state&#x27;s official hostess during his term in office.

The Boe administration improved the state&#x27;s reservoir system, enacted a worker training program to attract new industry to South Dakota, increased state aid to schools, and created a retirement program for state employees. The administration also was noteworthy for advocating property tax cuts and starting the state&#x27;s educational television system.

After leaving office, Boe was appointed by President Richard Nixon as the first director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs in the Executive Office of the President of the United States from 1969 to 1971.

==Federal Judicial Service==

Boe was nominated by President Richard Nixon on July 28, 1971, to a seat on the United States Customs Court vacated by Judge Samuel Murray Rosenstein. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 6, 1971, and received his commission on August 10, 1971. He served as Chief Judge from 1971 to 1977. He was reassigned by operation of law on November 1, 1980, to the United States Court of International Trade, to a new seat authorized by 94 Stat. 1727. He assumed senior status on April 30, 1984. His service terminated on July 30, 1992, due to his death. He was succeeded by Judge Nicholas Tsoucalas.

==Death==

Boe died of cancer on July 30, 1992, at Sioux Valley Hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

==Legacy==

In 1971, members of the Boe family had established an endowment at Augustana College (now Augustana University) for the Center for Western Studies to support a non-partisan lecture series. Nils Boe is memorialized by The Boe Forum on Public Affairs conducted annually at Augustana University.

<text>Mount Nelson is a mountain located near the west branch of Lynx Creek in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. Diadem Peak lies southeast of Mount Palmer

The mountain was named in 1952 by J. Monroe Thorington after an American climber with the last name of Nelson. Nelson had died in a climbing accident in The Bugaboos and the name was suggested by the first ascent party.

The first ascent was made in 1951 by Dale Ebersbacher, Frances Ebersbacher, Gil Roberts, Chuck Wilts, and Ellen Wilts.

<text>Ralph E. Herseth (July 2, 1909 – January 24, 1969) was the 21st governor of South Dakota from January 6, 1959, to January 3, 1961. He was a Democrat and was the patriarch of the prominent Herseth family of South Dakota.

==Early life and education==
Herseth was born in 1909 on a ranch near Houghton, South Dakota, the son of Oline (née Afseth) and Lars Herseth. His father was a Norwegian immigrant, as were his maternal grandparents. He graduated from Columbia High School, in Brown County, South Dakota. He attended Northern State Teachers College and North Dakota State College. He married Lorna H. Buntrock on December 23, 1937, and they lived on a ranch near Houghton. Lorna Herseth later became South Dakota&#x27;s Secretary of State. Their son Lars Herseth was Majority Leader of the State Senate, and granddaughter Stephanie Herseth Sandlin served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2004 until 2011.

==Political career==
Herseth was a Superintendent for the Civilian Conservation Corps (1935–39). He served in the South Dakota State Senate for Brown County from (1951–52) and (1957–58).

Herseth was only the third Democrat to hold the office of Governor of the state of South Dakota. As governor, he focused on state tax problems, appointing a Citizens Tax Study Commission to recommend tax reform. He was also active in developing South Dakota&#x27;s natural resources. Big Bend Dam on the Missouri River was begun during his single term in office. The state government experienced problems resulting from hard-hitting natural disasters in South Dakota in 1959; he was defeated for reelection in 1960, and for a return to office in 1962.

==Death==
Herseth, died from a heart attack on January 24, 1969, aged 59, while visiting a friend at home in Aberdeen, South Dakota. He had a history of heart problems, having previously suffered a heart attack in 1960. He is interred at Houghton Cemetery, Houghton, Brown County, South Dakota US.

<text>Vasily Makarovich Shukshin (; 25 July 1929 – 2 October 1974) was a Soviet Russian writer, actor, screenwriter and film director from the Altai region who specialized in rural themes. A prominent member of the Village Prose movement, he began writing short stories in his early teenage years and later transition to acting by his late 20s.

==Biography==
Vasiliy Makarovich Shukshin was born on 25 July 1929 to a peasant family of assimilated Moksha Mordvin origin in the village of Srostki near Biysk in Siberian Krai, Soviet Union (now in Altai Krai, Russia). In 1933, his father, Makar Leontievich Shukshin, was arrested and executed on the charges of participating in an &quot;anti-kolkhoz plot&quot; during the Soviet collectivization. He was only rehabilitated 23 years later, in 1956. His mother, Maria Sergeyevna (née Popova), thus had to look after the survival of the entire family. By 1943 Shukshin had finished seven years of village school and entered an automobile technical school in Biysk. In 1945, after two and a half years at the school but before finishing, he quit to work in a kolkhoz.

In 1946 Shukshin left his native village and worked as a metal craftsman at several enterprises in the trust Soyuzprommekhanizatsiya: at the turbine plant in Kaluga, at the tractor plant in Vladimir, etc. In 1949, Shukshin was drafted into the Navy. He first served as a sailor in the Baltic Fleet, then a radio operator on the Black Sea. In 1953 he was demobilized due to a stomach ulcer and returned to his native village. Having passed an external exam for high school graduation, he became a teacher of Russian, and later a school principal in Srostki.

In 1954 Shukshin entered the directors&#x27; department of the VGIK; he studied under Mikhail Romm and Sergei Gerasimov, and graduated in 1960. While studying at VGIK in 1958, Shukshin had his first leading role in Marlen Khutsiyev&#x27;s film &quot;Two Fedors&quot; and appeared in Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s graduation film.

In 1958 he published his first short story &quot;Two on the Cart&quot; in the magazine &quot;Smena&quot;. His first collection of stories &quot;Сельские жители&quot; (&quot;Village Dwellers&quot;) was published in 1963. That same year, he became staff director at the Gorky Film Studio in Moscow. He wrote and directed &quot;Живёт такой парень&quot; (&quot;There Is This Lad&quot;). The film premiered in 1965, winning top honours at the All-Union Film Festival in Leningrad and the Golden Lion at the XVI International Film Festival in Venice. Shukshin was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1967), and was designated Distinguished Artist of the RSFSR (1969).

Shukshin&#x27;s main interest lay in the situation of ordinary, simple people in the Soviet Union of his time. He laced his films with both humor and melancholy.

He married actress Lidiya Fedoseyeva in 1964; she also appeared in several of his films. Their daughter Mariya is a TV presenter.

Shukshin died suddenly on 2 October 1974, on the motor ship &quot;Dunai&quot;, on the Volga River, while filming &quot;They Fought for Their Country&quot;. He is buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>César David Izturis (; born February 10, 1980) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball shortstop. He played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers, Washington Nationals, and Cincinnati Reds. He is the half-brother of shortstop Maicer Izturis.

==Playing career==
===Toronto Blue Jays===
Signed by the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent in 1996, Izturis made his debut with Toronto in 2001 and had a .269 average.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
During the Winter Meetings after the 2001 season, the Blue Jays traded Izturis and Paul Quantrill to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Luke Prokopec and Chad Ricketts. Izturis started at shortstop from Opening Day of the 2002 season, and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers&#x27; infield. But he showed no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few walks. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 with 62 RBI and 25 stolen bases in 159 games. At the end of the season, he earned his first Gold Glove, the first by a Dodger shortstop since Maury Wills&#x27; back-to-back honors in 1961 and 1962.

In 2005, Izturis hit .348 through June 1 and led the entire majors in hits. He was selected for the National League All-Star team, but his batting average later dipped all the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to suffer. After two trips to the disabled list, Izturis underwent Tommy John surgery in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June 2006.

With the uncertainty around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop Rafael Furcal in the off-season. That move seemed to have put Izturis&#x27; future with the Dodgers in doubt. With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate to be benched.

===Chicago Cubs===
On July 31, 2006, at the trade deadline, the Dodgers traded Izturis to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for Greg Maddux and cash considerations. In 22 games for the Cubs down the stretch, he batted .233/.282/.260 with no home runs and six RBI.

Izturis made 65 appearances for Chicago to begin the 2007 season, slashing .246/.298/.304 with no home runs, eight RBI, and three stolen bases.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On July 19, 2007, Izturis and cash were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for a player to be named later. In 45 appearances for Pittsburgh, he batted .276/.310/.333 with no home runs and eight RBI. On November 16, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, and he became a free agent.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On November 30, 2007, Izturis signed a one-year, $2.85 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. Izturis made 135 appearances for St. Louis during the 2008 campaign, hitting .263/.319/.309 with one home run, 24 RBI, and 24 stolen bases.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year, major league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. In 2009, he led all starting shortstops in range factor, at 4.89. Izturis made 114 appearances for Baltimore during the year, slashing .256/.294/.328 with two home runs, 30 RBI, and 12 stolen bases. In 150 appearances for the Orioles during the 2010 season, Izturis batted .230/.277/.269 with one home run, 28 RBI, and 11 stolen bases.

On December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the Orioles on a one-year, $1.5 million contract. He played in 18 games for Baltimore in 2011, 6-for-30 (.200) with 1 RBI and 2 walks. Izturis missed a chunk of the season after undergoing surgery to repair an ulnar nerve injury. On August 11, 2011, he was placed on the disabled list with a left groin strain, and missed the remainder of the season.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
On December 21, 2011, Izturis signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers organization that included an invitation to spring training. On March 29, 2012, it was announced that Izturis had made Milwaukee&#x27;s Opening Day roster, with his contract being formally selected on April 1. In 57 appearances for the Brewers, he slashed .235/.249/.333 with two home runs and 11 RBI.

===Washington Nationals===
On August 6, 2012, Izturis was claimed off waivers by the Washington Nationals. In 5 games for Washington, he went 2-for-4 (.500). Izturis was designated for assignment by the Nationals on August 17, only 11 days after arriving in Washington. He elected free agency on August 20.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On January 14, 2013, the Cincinnati Reds announced that they had signed Izturis to a minor league contract that included an invitation to spring training. On March 31, the Reds selected Izturis&#x27; contract after he made the team&#x27;s Opening Day roster. In 63 appearances for Cincinnati, he batted .209/.259/.271 with no home runs and 11 RBI.

===Houston Astros===
On January 13, 2014, Izturis signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. On March 24, after being informed he would not make the team, Izturis opted out of his contract and was released by the Astros organization. On April 19, it was reported that Izturis had turned down minor league offers in hopes of landing a major league contract.

==Coaching career==
On February 11, 2025, Izturis was announced as the bench coach for the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League.

==Personal life==
Izturis resides in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, with his wife Liliana and their two children; his son Cesar Daniel (born November 11, 1999) and daughter Daniella (born July 17, 2006). In 2016, Cesar Daniel signed with the Seattle Mariners as an international free agent. Cesar Daniel is a Venezuelan professional baseball infielder for the Lake Country DockHounds of the American Association of Professional Baseball.

<doc id="707215" wikidata="Q76349" url="?curid=707215" title="Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck">
<text>Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck (14 February 1776 – 16 March 1858) was a prolific German botanist, physician, zoologist, and natural philosopher. He was a contemporary of Goethe and was born within the lifetime of Linnaeus. He described approximately 7,000 plant species (almost as many as Linnaeus himself). His last official act as president of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina was to admit Charles Darwin as a member. He was the author of numerous monographs on botany and zoology and majority of his best-known works deal with fungi.

==Biography==
Nees von Esenbeck was born in Schloss Reichenberg near Reichelsheim (Odenwald) in Hesse, Germany. He showed an early interest in science and, after receiving his primary education in Darmstadt, went on to the University of Jena and obtained his degree in biology (natural history) and medicine in 1800. He practiced as a physician for Francis I (Erbach-Erbach), but he had developed a great interest in botany during his university studies which caused him to return to academia. In 1816, he joined the Leopoldina Academy, which was one of the most prestigious institutions in Europe. In 1817, he was appointed professor of botany at the University of Erlangen. Three years later, he became professor of natural history at the University of Bonn, where he established the Botanische Gärten der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn. In 1831, he was appointed as a chair of botany department at the University of Breslau. In 1818, he was elected president of the Leopoldina Academy. He continued as president of the academy for the rest of his life.
In botany he achieved notoriety for his contributions to the families Acanthaceae and Lauraceae.

He also became politically active in the German revolutions of 1848–1849. In 1851, due to conflicts with the government, he was deprived of his professorship and pension at Breslau. Seven years later, Nees von Esenbeck died essentially penniless in Breslau. He was an older brother to botanist Theodor Friedrich Ludwig Nees von Esenbeck (1787–1837).

==Career==
Her first stage role was as Mary Magdalene in a 1983 professional production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. In the late 1980s, Brown branched out into commercial and television work in Florida; in 1990 she moved to New York City where she appeared in Williamstown Theatre Festival production of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; and Broadway production of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;.

In 1992, Brown moved back to California and appeared in guest-starring roles on several series. Following the departure of Mary Woronov from the series and the last-minute loss of originally cast Susan Kellermann, &quot;Babylon 5&#x27;s&quot; casting director called her and unexpectedly offered her the role of Na&#x27;Toth on the first season of the science-fiction series.

Brown appeared in five episodes and declined to stay for a second season. The role of Na&#x27;Toth was recast with Mary Kay Adams, and Brown went on to return for guest appearances during the second season (as a human lawyer in &quot;There All the Honor Lies&quot;) and the fifth season. (&quot;A Tragedy of Telepaths&quot; reprising the role of Na&#x27;Toth)

Brown&#x27;s other television guest credits include &quot;Becker&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (in the episode &quot;The Passenger&quot;) and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Gambit 1&quot; and &quot;Gambit 2&quot;). She played the Kromagg Leader in the 1999 &quot;Sliders&quot; episode (5/11) &quot;Requiem&quot;. In 2009, she portrayed Tammy Tennis in Joshua Grannell&#x27;s comedy horror film &quot;All About Evil&quot;. In 2010, she wrote, produced and starred in the short film &quot;Thoughts of Suicide on an Otherwise Lovely Day&quot;.

Also a singer, Brown&#x27;s first CD, &quot;Sheddin&#x27; My Skin&quot;, was released in January 1998. Her second album, &quot;Struck by Lightning&quot;, came out July 2002.

<doc id="707232" wikidata="Q580048" url="?curid=707232" title="Boris Polevoy">
<text>Boris Nikolayevich Polevoy (; – 12 July 1981) was a Soviet and Russian writer, screenwriter, journalist and war correspondent. He is the author of the book &quot;The Story of a Real Man&quot; about Soviet World War II fighter pilot Aleksey Maresyev.

==Biography==
Boris Polevoy was a pseudonym for Boris Nikolayevich Kampov. He was born in Moscow in 1908, the son of a lawyer from a Russian Orthodox priest family. His parents were Nikolay Petrovich and Lidiya (Vasilyevna) Kampov. He was a graduate of the Tver Industrial Technical College (now Kalinin Industrial College).

Prior to starting his career as a writer, he worked as a technologist at a textile factory in Kalinin. As he began his journalism career in 1928, his talents were such that he was chosen to be patronized by Maxim Gorky.

His &quot;nom de plume&quot; has several variations based on transliterations. It was derived from translating Latin &quot;campus&quot; to Russian &quot;pole&quot; (″a field″).

He is perhaps best known for his reporting on the atrocities at Auschwitz soon after its liberation, which were the first to have been published in &quot;Pravda&quot;. His accounts reportedly differ from what others found, including a description of a conveyor belt that first electrocuted, then transported inmates&#x27; corpses into a furnace.

Polevoy began reporting for &quot;Pravda&quot; in 1939 or 1941. At the time, he was still serving in the Red Army as a lieutenant colonel. He would eventually attain the rank of colonel. He continued as a war correspondent for the newspaper until 1945.

&quot;Story About a True Man&quot; (also translated as &quot;Story of a Real Man&quot;), based on the life of Aleksey Maresyev, was an immensely popular novel. It was eventually made into an opera by Prokofiev. It was first published in English in 1952, and was reprinted in 1970. The protagonist was also honored by having an asteroid named for him.

He also served as a deputy to Supreme Soviet Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (R.S.F.S.R.) from 1951 to 1966 and was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1940 until his death. As such he was involved in party politics as a member of various organizations. He was chief editor of the literary youth magazine &quot;Yunost&quot; () from 1962 until his death and was a board member of the Union of Soviet Journalists from 1959. He also served on the Soviet Peace Committee and Bureau World Peace Council.

For years, Polevoy exchanged a series of letters with Howard Fast, an American writer who had been a member of the Communist Party for 15 years, and best known as the author of &quot;Spartacus&quot;. The two had met briefly. Fast attempted to contact Polevoy when he decided to withdraw from the party, but there was no response from Polevoy. Fast decided to make his letters public. Polevoy eventually responded. Whether the delay was the result of the letters being intercepted or the result of Polevoy&#x27;s reluctance to respond remains unclear.

Polevoy writes that when he received Fast&#x27;s news, that night I could not fall asleep. I kept thinking of your books. Their heroes crowded around me and together with them, as it were, I went over the whole situation. I felt sure that Gideon Jackson, who fought the good fight to the bitter end, would not have been less taken aback than I was by what happened. Neither would Spartacus, even if he did live at a time when there were neither the philosophical theories nor the practical experience that throw light over mankind&#x27;s path today, a time without the cultural values of today or the progressive intellectuals bearing aloft the banner of peace at all circumstances.&quot;

His popularity with Soviet readers never diminished. &quot;Polevoy&#x27;s books, articles, and political commentaries gained him an international readership well before the end of the war. He remained influential until his death in 1981, at which time he was secretary of the all-powerful Union of Soviet Writers,&quot; wrote Heddescheimer. During his lifetime, Polevoy was named a Hero of Socialist Labour and awarded the Stalin Prize for literature, three Orders of Lenin, two Red Banners, the Red Star, and the Gold Medal of the World Peace Council.

==Personal life==
He married Yulia Osipovna in 1939; the couple had two sons and a daughter.

<text>Orber Aquiles Moreno Sulbarán (born April 27, 1977) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball relief pitcher. He played for the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) who in parts of three seasons spanning 1999–2004. Listed at 6&#x27; 3&quot; (1.90 m), 225 lb. (102 k), Moreno batted and threw right-handed.

Moreno threw a sharp slider, a changeup and a cutter, but had a good command of his low-90s fastball. He made his majors debut in the 1999 season, ranking as one of the top Royals prospects, but he injured his arm in an off-field accident and aggravated it by pitching.

Moreno had surgery performed and rehabbed at Triple-A in 2002, but then he showed up out of shape from the long layoff and was released. Soon after that, he signed with the Mets, pitching for them from 2003 to 2004.

In between, Moreno pitched 12 years in the Minor Leagues, including stints with the Diablos Rojos del México, Dorados de Chihuahua and Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League, and for the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan Winter League during 12 seasons from 1996 to 2013.

<text>Rubén Eduardo Quevedo (; January 5, 1979 – June 7, 2016) was a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs (2000) and Milwaukee Brewers (2001–03).

==Career==
Quevedo was signed as an international free agent by the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and was traded to the Cubs in 1999. He played with the Cubs in 2000 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in 2001 for right-handed pitcher David Weathers. After three years with Milwaukee, Quevedo signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles in 2004. He appeared in one game for Baltimore&#x27;s Double–A affiliate, the Bowie Baysox.

Quevedo&#x27;s most effective pitch was his changeup, which he threw with the same arm motion as his 89 MPH fastball. Meanwhile, his slider and curve were average. He allowed a significant number of fly balls, resulting in a high number of home runs allowed. In a four-year MLB career, Quevedo posted a 14–30 record with 237 strikeouts and a 6.15 ERA in 326.1 innings. During his minor league career he was named a Triple–A All-Star in 2001 while pitching for the Iowa Cubs.

==Personal life==
Quevedo died of a heart attack on June 7, 2016.

<text>Darwin Harrikson Cubillán Salom (born November 15, 1972) is a Venezuelan former Major League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher.

==Career==
Originally signed as a free agent by the Yankees in 1993, Cubillán has played in the MLB for the Toronto Blue Jays (2000), Texas Rangers (2000), Montreal Expos (2001) and Baltimore Orioles (2004). In three-season career, Cubillán compiled a 1–0 record with 54 strikeouts and a 6.85 ERA.

Cubillán played in Japan for the Hanshin Tigers of the Central League, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) from 2005 until 2007. He played using his first name &quot;Darwin&quot;, because his last name Cubillán sounds like &quot;Kubi yan&quot; (クビやん) meaning &quot;He is fired, isn&#x27;t he?&quot; in Japanese Kansai dialect, and &quot;Darwin&quot; has the same spelling as the last name of an English naturalist, Charles Darwin. In 2008, he signed with the SK Wyverns in South Korea, but was released during the season.

Cubillán also pitched winter ball for the Tigres de Aragua and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.

<text>Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev (; – 13 May 1956) was a Soviet writer, one of the co-founders of the Union of Soviet Writers and its chairman from 1946 to 1954.

==Biography==
Fadeyev was born in Kimry, Tver Governorate. From 1908 to 1912, he lived in Chuguyevka, Primorsky Krai. He joined the Bolshevik Party in 1918 and took part in the guerrilla movement against the Japanese interventionists and the White Army during the Russian Civil War. In 1927, he published the novel &quot;The Rout&quot; (also known as &quot;The Nineteen&quot;), in which he described youthful guerrilla fighters. In 1930, he published the first part of the novel &quot;The Last of the Udege&quot;, on which he continued working the rest of his life (an edition containing the second volume, all he was able to complete, was published in 1940.) In it, Fadeyev intended to show &quot;that an extremely primitive people may experience a leap from tribal communism to the complex collective organization of the twentieth century, skipping over the intervening historical stages: family, private property, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism. [...] Uneven though it is, &quot;The Last of the Udegs&quot; contains some of Fadeyev&#x27;s best pages, and the fact that he spent his energies on literary administration rather than on the completion of this novel is a minor tragedy.&quot;

In 1945, he wrote the novel, &quot;The Young Guard&quot; (based upon real events of World War II) about the underground Komsomol organization named Young Guard, which fought against the Nazis in the occupied city Krasnodon (in the Ukrainian SSR). For this novel, Fadeyev was awarded the Stalin Prize (1946). In 1948, a Soviet film &quot;The Young Guard&quot;, based on the book, was released, and later revised in 1964 to correct inaccuracies in the book.

Fadeyev was a champion of Joseph Stalin, proclaiming him &quot;the greatest humanist the world has ever known&quot;. During the 1940s, he actively promoted Zhdanovshchina, a campaign of criticism and persecution against many of the Soviet Union&#x27;s foremost writers and composers. However, he was a friend of Mikhail Sholokhov. Fadeyev married a famous stage actress, Angelina Stepanova (1905–2000). He fathered Masha Enzenberger from an alliance with the poet Margarita Aliger (1943).

In the last years of his life, Fadeyev developed a nervous condition, exacerbated by the prolonged abuse of alcohol. Some sources claim that this was mostly due to the denunciation of Stalinism during the Khrushchev Thaw. He eventually committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart at his dacha in Peredelkino, leaving a suicide note which made clear his negative attitude to both the old and the new leaders of the Party. Fadeyev referred to Stalin as a &quot;satrap&quot; in the note. His suicide occurred after he was denounced by his friend Mikhail Sholokhov; he was also blamed for the poor state of Soviet literature at the 20th Party Congress. In his suicide note, Fadeyev attacked the Stalinists who had &quot;physically exterminated&quot; the best Soviet authors, and said that they had &quot;brought us [writers] down to the level of children; they destroyed us; they threatened us ideologically and called this &#x27;the Party spirit&#x27;&quot;. He attacked the new members of the Soviet leadership, claiming that they were uneducated people who manifested &quot;primitivism and ignorance--along with a disgraceful share of self-assurance&quot; in their attempts to promote Soviet literature.

Fadeyev&#x27;s death occasioned an epigram by Boris Pasternak, his neighbor. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

==Legacy==
In her memoirs, Nadezhda Mandelstam, after describing Fadeyev&#x27;s seemingly affectionate farewell to Osip Mandelstam just before his final arrest, wrote: &quot;Liuba [Ehrenburg] has told me that Fadeyev was a cold and cruel man – something quite compatible with emotionalism and the ability to shed a tear at the right moment. This became very clear, according to Liuba, at the time of the execution of the Yiddish writers. Then also it was a case of tearful farewell embraces after he had signified his formal agreement to their arrest and liquidation – even though the Yiddish writers, unlike Mandelstam, were his friends.&quot; And Korney Chukovsky wrote the following in his diary entry after Fadeyev&#x27;s suicide:
I feel very sorry for dear Alexander Alexandrovich: one could sense a man of stature, a Russian brand of natural genius under all the layers — but, good lord, what layers there were! All the lies of the Stalinist era, all its idiotic atrocities, all its horrific bureaucracy, all its corruption and red tape found a willing accessory in him. An essentially decent human being who loved literature “to tears” had ended by steering the ship of literature into the most perilous, most shameful of waters and attempting to combine humaneness with the secret-police mentality. Hence the zigzags in his behavior, hence the tortured conscience of his final years. He wasn&#x27;t born to be a loser; he was so accustomed to being a leader, the arbiter of writers&#x27; fates, that having to withdraw from the position of literary marshal was agony for him. None of his friends was willing to tell him that his &quot;Metallurgy&quot; was worthless, that the articles he had been writing during the past few years — cowardly, turbid, and full of normative pretensions — could only lower him in the eyes of the reading public, that reworking &quot;The Young Guard&quot; to suit the powers-that-be was shameful. Conscientious, talented, and sensitive as he was, he was floundering in oozy, putrid mud and drowning his conscience in wine.

<text>Michael Edward Knight (born May 7, 1959) is an American television actor, best known for his role as Tad Martin on ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

== Biography ==
Knight was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He was educated at The Thacher School in Ojai, California, and attended Wesleyan University, graduating in 1980, a year ahead of schedule.

Knight&#x27;s first major acting role was portraying Tad Martin on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. His first stint on the show ran from 1982–1986. He returned from 1988–1990, and again from 1992 until the ABC series finale in 2011 and the online revival of the series in 2013. Knight also appeared as Ted Orsini on &quot;AMC&quot; from 1993–1994. His reason for initially leaving &quot;All My Children&quot; was to pursue acting projects on the West Coast, which included a starring role in the feature film &quot;Date with an Angel&quot; (1987), and various primetime appearances — including &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot; and &quot;Grapevine&quot;. Knight co-starred in the off-Broadway play &quot;Wrong Turn at Lungfish&quot;, and he appeared in the ABC movie for television &quot;She Stood Alone: The Tailhook Scandal&quot;, and in the off-Broadway &quot;Cakewalk&quot; with Linda Lavin.

Knight was honored with two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series (1986 and 1987). In 2001, he was honored with his third Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He also received the 1997 Soap Opera Digest Award for &#x27;Best Supporting Actor&#x27; and a nomination in the same category in 1998. In 2005, he was nominated for an Emmy for &#x27;Outstanding Leading Actor&#x27;.

Knight was married from June 27, 1992 through 2006 to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; star Catherine Hickland, who was previously married to actor David Hasselhoff who coincidentally had played a character named &quot;Michael Knight&quot;.

Knight and Hickland were honored for their charitable work by the West End Intergenerational Residence in Manhattan in 1999.

In 2015 and 2016, Knight had a recurring role as Dr. Simon Neville on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. On February 2, 2017, Knight made a surprise appearance on the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; show, where he was reunited with a number of his former &quot;All My Children&quot; castmates.

On September 30, 2019, Knight began appearing in a recurring role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as lawyer Martin Gray.

<doc id="707304" wikidata="Q499527" url="?curid=707304" title="Shalimar Gardens, Lahore">
<text>The Shalamar Gardens () or Shalimar Gardens () are a Mughal garden complex besides Baghbanpura, located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The gardens date from the period when the Mughal Empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith, and are now one of Pakistan&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations.

The Shalamar Gardens were laid out as a Persian paradise garden intended to create a representation of an earthly utopia in which humans co-exist in perfect harmony with all elements of nature. Construction of the gardens began in 1641 during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan, and was completed in 1642. In 1981 the Shalamar Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as they embody Mughal garden design at the apogee of its development.

==Names==
The courtiers told the Maharaja Ranjit Singh &quot;that Shala was a Turkic word which means pleasure and the mar means the place to live in&quot;. &quot;The arguments of the courtiers in favour of the Turkic signification of the word failing to make any impression on Ranjit Singh, he gave his own name to the garden, and called it “&quot;Shahla Bagh&quot;” شهلا باغ, “&quot;Shahla&quot;” meaning in Persian “sweetheart” with dark gray eyes and a shade of red and “&quot;Bagh&quot;” meaning “garden.”&quot;
The gardens are however still known as the &quot;Shalimar Gardens&quot; nowadays. According to Muhammad Ishtiaq Khan,
==Location==
The Shalimar Garden is located next to the Grand Trunk Road, about east of the Delhi Gate of the Walled City of Lahore. Near Bhaghbanpura Lahore

==Background==

Lahore&#x27;s Shalimar Gardens were built by the Mughal royal family primarily as a venue for them to entertain guests, though a large portion was open to the general public. The gardens&#x27; design was influenced by the older Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir that were built by Shah Jahan&#x27;s father, Emperor Jahangir. Unlike the gardens in Kashmir which relied on naturally sloping landscapes, the waterworks in Lahore required extensive engineering to create artificial cascades and terraces.

The Shalimar Gardens were designed as a Persian-style &quot;Charbagh&quot; &quot;Paradise garden&quot; - a microcosm of an earthly utopia. Though the word &quot;Bagh&quot; is translated simply as &quot;garden&quot;, &quot;bagh&quot; represents a harmonious existence between humans and nature, and represents a poetic connection between heaven and earth. All natural elements of the &quot;bagh&quot; are appreciated - including the sun, moon, and air. Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, historian to Shah Jahan, reported that the gardens of Kashmir inspired the design for the Shalimar Garden in Lahore, and that a wide variety of trees and flowers grew together in the garden.

The site was chosen for its stable water supply. The project was managed by Khalilullah Khan, a noble of Shah Jahan&#x27;s court, in cooperation with and Mulla Alaul Maulk Tuni. Ali Mardan Khan was responsible for most of the construction, and had a 100-mile-long canal built to bring water from the foothills of Kashmir to the site.

The site of the Shalimar Gardens originally belonged to the Arain Mian Family Baghbanpura. Mian Muhammad Yusuf, then the head of the Arain Mian family, ceded the site of &quot;Ishaq Pura&quot; to the Emperor Shah Jahan in order for the gardens to be built. In return, Shah Jahan granted the Arain Mian family governance of the Shalimar Gardens, and the gardens remained under their custodianship for over 350 years.

==History==

Construction of the gardens began on 12 June 1641, and took 18 months to complete. During the Sikh Empire, much of the garden&#x27;s marble was pillaged and used to decorate the Golden Temple and the Ram Bagh Palace in nearby Amritsar, while the gardens&#x27; costly agate gate was stripped and sold by Lehna Singh Majithia.

In 1806 Maharaja Ranjit Singh ordered the Shalimar Gardens to be repaired.

The Gardens were nationalised in 1962 by General Ayub Khan because leading Arain Mian family members had opposed his imposition of martial law in Pakistan.

The annual Mela Chiraghan festival used to take place in the gardens until General Ayub Khan forbade it in 1958.

==Design and layout==
Mughal Gardens were based upon Timurid gardens built in Central Asia and Iran between the 14th and 16th century. A high brick wall richly decorated with intricate fretwork encloses the site in order to allow for the creation of a &quot;Charbagh&quot; paradise garden - a microcosm of an earthly utopia.

The Shalimar Gardens are laid out in the form of a rectangle aligned along a north–south axis, and measure 658 metres by 258 metres, and cover an area of 16 hectares. Each terrace level is 4–5 metres (13–15 feet) higher than the previous level.

The uppermost terrace of the gardens is named &quot;Bagh-e-Farah Baksh&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Bestower of Pleasure&quot;. The second and third terraces are jointly known as the &quot;Bagh-e-Faiz Baksh&quot;, meaning &quot;Bestower of Goodness&quot;. The first and third terraces are both shaped as squares, while the second terrace is a narrow rectangle.

Shalimar&#x27;s main entrance was onto the lower-most terrace, which was open to noblemen, and occasionally to the public. The middle terrace was the Emperor&#x27;s Garden, and contained the most elaborate waterworks of any Mughal garden. The highest terrace was reserved for the Emperor&#x27;s &quot;harem&quot;.

The square shaped terraces were both divided into four equivalent smaller squares by long fountains flanked by brick &quot;khayaban&quot; walkways designed to be elevated in order to provide better views of the garden. Cascades were made to flow over a marble paths in what are known as &quot;chadors&quot;, or &quot;curtains&quot; into the middle terrace. Water collected into a large pool, known as a &quot;haūz&quot;, over which a seating pavilion was made.

===Water features===
The Shalimar Garden&#x27;s contain the most waterworks of any Mughal Garden. It contains 410 fountains, which discharge into wide marble pools, each known as a &quot;haūz&quot;. The enclosed garden is rendered cooler than surrounding areas by the garden&#x27;s dense foliage, and water features - a relief during Lahore&#x27;s blistering summers, with temperature sometimes exceeding . The distribution of the fountains is as follows:

* The upper level terrace has 105 fountains.
* The middle level terrace has 152 fountains.
* The lower level terrace has 153 fountains.
* All combined, the Gardens has 410 fountains.

The Gardens have 5 water cascades including &quot;the great marble cascade&quot; and &quot;Sawan Bhadoon&quot;.

===Garden pavilions===

The buildings of the Gardens include:
===Conservation===
In 1981, Shalimar Gardens was included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the Lahore Fort, under the UNESCO Convention concerning the protection of the world&#x27;s cultural and natural heritage sites in 1972.

<text>The Malheur River ( ) is a tributary of the Snake River in eastern Oregon in the United States. It drains a high desert area, between the Harney Basin, the Blue Mountains and the Snake.

In the past Malheur Lake (located in the enclosed Harney Basin to the southwest) outflowed into the river.

==Course==
The Malheur River rises in the southern Blue Mountains of southern Grant County, south of Strawberry Mountain in the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness. It flows south through Malheur National Forest, then southeast past Drewsey and through Warm Springs Reservoir. At Riverside in western Malheur County, it receives the South Fork Malheur River from the south, then turns sharply back northward to Juntura, where it receives the North Fork Malheur River from the north. From Juntura it flows generally east past Vale, joining the Snake from the west approximately north of Ontario, Oregon. The mouth of the Malheur River is approximately at Snake river mile (RM) 370 or river kilometer (RK) 600.

==History==
The name of the river is derived from the French for &quot;misfortune&quot;. The name was attached to the river by French Canadian voyageur trappers working for the North West Company on the Snake County Expeditions of Donald Mackenzie as early as 1818 for the unfortunate circumstance that some beaver furs they had cached there were snatched by Indigenous people. The name first appears in the record in 1826 when Peter Skene Ogden, a fur trapper with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, referred to it as &quot;River au Malheur (from &quot;rivière au Malheur&quot;, literally: River of the Misfortune&quot;) and thereafter as &quot;Unfortunate River&quot;.

The river lived up to its name a second time in 1845, when mountain man Stephen Meek, seeking a faster route along the Oregon Trail, led a migrant party up the river valley into the high desert along a route that has since become known as the Meek Cutoff. After leaving the river valley, the party was unable to find a water supply and lost 23 people by the time they reached The Dalles on the Columbia River; gold was found, also see Lost Blue Bucket Mine.

In 1853, 1854 and 1859 the river was used more successfully as the route of the Elliott Cutoff. The emigrants followed the ruts of Stephen Meek until they reached Harney Basin. From here they sought more direct routes to the Deschutes River, where they turned south until reaching the Free Emigrant Road. The road was built over the Cascades through Willamette Pass and brought emigrants into Central Oregon.

==River modifications==
The lower Malheur River is used for irrigation in the agricultural potato-growing in the Snake River Plain along the Idaho-Oregon border.

There are approximately of irrigation-related canals and ditches in the lower basin of the Malheur River and its tributary Willow Creek. The streamflow of the Malheur and its tributaries is heavily influenced by a complex system of irrigation diversions, siphons, and canals, which begin near Malheur river mile 65, near Namorf and Harper, Oregon. This irrigation system extends downstream to the mouth of the Malheur at Ontario, Oregon. Irrigation is used on about within the Malheur River basin. The irrigation system is part of the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Vale Project, which includes a number of water impoundments, the largest of which are Warm Springs Reservoir on the mainstem Malheur River, Beulah Reservoir on the North Fork Malheur, Bully Creek Reservoir on Bully Creek, and Malheur Reservoir on Willow Creek. The project is operated and maintained by the Vale-Oregon Irrigation District.

Agricultural runoff has resulted in a phosphorus pollution problem in its lower reaches.

==Natural history==
The Malheur River watershed was once a major spawning ground for anadromous fish such as salmon. In the early 20th century a number of dams on the Snake River blocked fish migration.

==Protected area==
A segment of the Malheur River from Bosenberg Creek to the Malheur National Forest boundary became protected as wild and scenic in 1988 as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The protected area includes of land along the river.

<text>Attachment disorder is a broad term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from unavailability of normal socializing care and attention from primary caregiving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between three months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.

==&quot;Attachment&quot; and &quot;attachment disorder&quot;==

Attachment theory is primarily an evolutionary and ethological theory. In relation to infants, it primarily consists of &quot;proximity seeking&quot; to an &quot;attachment figure&quot; in the face of threat, for the purpose of survival. Although an attachment is a &quot;tie&quot;, it is not synonymous with love and affection, despite their often going together; a healthy attachment is considered an important foundation of all subsequent relationships. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to &quot;internal working models&quot; that guide one&#x27;s feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.

A fundamental aspect of attachment is called &quot;basic trust&quot;. Basic trust is a broader concept than attachment in that it extends beyond the infant-caregiver relationship to &quot;the wider social network of trustable and caring others&quot; and &quot;links confidence about the past with faith about the future&quot;. &quot;Erikson argues that the sense of trust in oneself and others is the foundation of human development&quot; and with a balance of mistrust produces hope.

In the clinical sense, a disorder is a condition requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term &quot;attachment disorder&quot;, but there is general agreement that such disorders arise only after early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of &quot;proximity seeking&quot; to an identified &quot;attachment figure&quot;. This can occur in institutions, with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for a child&#x27;s basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this understanding of the nature of attachment.

The words &quot;attachment style&quot; or &quot;pattern&quot; refer to the various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called &quot;secure&quot;, &quot;anxious-ambivalent&quot;, &quot;anxious-avoidant&quot;, (all organized), and &quot;disorganized&quot;. Some of these styles are more problematic than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term &#x27;attachment disorder&#x27;.

Discussion of the disorganized attachment style sometimes includes it under the rubric of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that takes a person ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood. Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in life.

Zeanah and colleagues proposed an alternative set of criteria (see below) of three categories of attachment disorder, namely &quot;no discriminated attachment figure&quot;, &quot;secure base distortions&quot; and &quot;disrupted attachment disorder&quot;. These classifications consider a disorder a variation that requires treatment rather than an individual difference within the normal range.

==Boris and Zeanah&#x27;s typology==
Many leading attachment theorists, such as Zeanah and Leiberman, have recognized the limitations of the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria and proposed broader diagnostic criteria. There is as yet no official consensus on these criteria. The APSAC Taskforce recognised in its recommendations that &quot;attachment problems extending beyond RAD, are a real and appropriate concern for professionals working with children&quot;, and set out recommendations for assessment.

Boris and Zeanah (1999), have offered an approach to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those where there is a distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a &quot;specified&quot; attachment figure.

Boris and Zeanah use the term &quot;disorder of attachment&quot; to indicate a situation in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. Such children may be indiscriminately sociable and approach all adults, whether familiar or not; alternatively, they may be emotionally withdrawn and fail to seek comfort from anyone. This type of attachment problem is parallel to reactive attachment disorder as defined in DSM and ICD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as described above.

Boris and Zeanah also describe a condition they term &quot;secure base distortion&quot;. In this situation, the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, may cling to the adult, may be excessively compliant, or may show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult.

The third type of disorder discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed &quot;disrupted attachment&quot;. This type of problem, which is not covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child&#x27;s reaction to such a loss is parallel to the grief reaction of an older person, with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.

Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.

==Problems of attachment style==

The majority of 1-year-old children can tolerate brief separations from familiar caregivers and are quickly comforted when the caregivers return. These children also use familiar people as a &quot;secure base&quot; and return to them periodically when exploring a new situation. Such children are said to have a secure attachment style, and characteristically continue to develop well both cognitively and emotionally.

Smaller numbers of children show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children&#x27;s behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, they appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.

Insecure attachment styles in toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or may go to the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to the caregiver, and fail to return to their previous play. These children are more likely to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.

A small group of toddlers show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness of the person who is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.

==Possible mechanisms==
One study has reported a connection between a specific genetic marker and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting. Another author has compared atypical social behavior in genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome with behaviors symptomatic of RAD.

Typical attachment development begins with unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to send and receive social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This makes it possible for an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver&#x27;s interaction style and ability to understand the child&#x27;s emotional communications.

With insensitive or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, an infant may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult&#x27;s face and voice may develop atypical ways of coping with fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as the development of an internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.

Atypical development of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, might be necessary before an infant is vulnerable to the effects of poor attachment experiences.

Alternatively, the two variations of RAD may develop from the same inability to develop &quot;stranger-wariness&quot; due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may only be able to develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is not in a position to do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.

In the inhibited form infants behave as if their attachment system has been &quot;switched off&quot;. However the innate capacity for attachment behavior cannot be lost. This may explain why children diagnosed with the inhibited form of RAD from institutions almost invariably go on to show formation of attachment behavior to good carers. However children with the inhibited form as a consequence of neglect and frequent changes of caregiver continue to show the inhibited form for far longer when placed in families.

Additionally, the development of Theory of Mind &quot;may&quot; play a role in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie the development of reactive attachment disorder.

==Diagnosis==

Recognised assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation procedure (Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment (&quot;PAA&quot;), the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (&quot;ORCE&quot;) and the Attachment Q-sort (&quot;AQ-sort&quot;).
More recent research also uses the Disturbances of Attachment Interview or &quot;DAI&quot; developed by Smyke and Zeanah, (1999). This is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely having a discriminated, preferred adult, seeking comfort when distressed, responding to comfort when offered, social and emotional reciprocity, emotional regulation, checking back after venturing away from the care giver, reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to go off with relative strangers, self endangering behavior, excessive clinging, vigilance/hypercompliance and role reversal.

===Classification===
ICD-10 describes Reactive Attachment Disorder of Childhood, known as RAD, and Disinhibited Disorder of Childhood, less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood. It divides this into two subtypes, Inhibited Type and Disinhibited Type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
*markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts,
*the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for Pervasive Developmental Disorder,
*onset before 5 years of age,
*requires a history of significant neglect, and
*implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.
ICD-10 includes in its diagnosis psychological and physical abuse and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a &quot;commission&quot; rather than &quot;omission&quot; and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder [why not?].

The inhibited form is described as &quot;a failure to initiate or respond ... to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited responses&quot; and such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain &#x27;proximity&#x27;, an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows &quot;indiscriminate sociability ... excessive familiarity with relative strangers&quot; (DSM-IV-TR) and therefore a lack of &#x27;specificity&#x27;, the second basic element of attachment behavior. The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable. &#x27;Disinhibited&#x27; and &#x27;inhibited&#x27; are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can co-exist in the same child. The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver whilst the disinhibited form is more enduring.

While RAD is likely to occur following neglectful and abusive childcare, there should be no automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further, although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver, or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child&#x27;s basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.

==Treatment==

There are a variety of mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment disorder, attachment problems and moods or behaviors considered to be potential problems within the context of attachment theory. All such approaches for infants and younger children concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, changing the caregiver. Such approaches include &#x27;Watch, wait and wonder,&#x27; manipulation of sensitive responsiveness, modified &#x27;Interaction Guidance,&#x27;. &#x27;Preschool Parent Psychotherapy,&#x27;. Circle of Security&#x27;, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), the New Orleans Intervention, and Parent-Child psychotherapy. Other known treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, Relationship-based therapy (DIR) (also referred to as &quot;Floor Time&quot;) by Stanley Greenspan, although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders Some of these approaches, such as that suggested by Dozier, consider the attachment status of the adult caregiver to play an important role in the development of the emotional connection between adult and child. This includes foster parents, as children with poor attachment experiences often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses from their attachment behaviors despite &#x27;normative&#x27; care.

Treatment for reactive attachment disorder for children usually involves a mix of therapy, counseling, and parenting education. These must be designed to make sure the child has a safe environment to live in and to develop positive interactions with caregivers and improves their relationships with their peers.

Medication can be used to treat similar conditions, like depression, anxiety, or hyperactivity, but there is no quick fix for reactive attachment disorder. A pediatrician may recommend a treatment plan, such as a mix of family therapy, individual psychological counseling, play therapy, special education services and parenting skills classes.

==Pseudoscientific diagnoses and treatment==

In the absence of officially recognized diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term &quot;attachment disorder&quot; has been increasingly used by clinicians to refer to a broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and &#x27;snapshots&#x27;. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.

A common feature of this form of diagnosis within attachment therapy is the use of extensive lists of &quot;symptoms&quot; that include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as &quot;wildly inclusive&quot;. The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behavior, refusal to make eye contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, &quot;prefers dad to mom&quot; or &quot;wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible&quot; are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that &quot;high rates of false positive diagnoses are virtually certain&quot; and that &quot;posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders&quot;.

There is also a considerable variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies have little or no evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in them to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods that emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.

Two of the best-known cases are those of Candace Newmaker in 2001 and the Gravelles in 2003 to 2005. After the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in 2006, commissioned by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC), which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue. In 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to coercive practices in therapy and parenting.

<text>Richard Marco Kovacevich (born October 30, 1943) is an American business executive and the former CEO of Wells Fargo &amp; Company.

==Early life and education==
A native of Tacoma, Washington, he grew up in Enumclaw, Washington, a lumber town about 30 miles southeast of Seattle, where his father (of Croatian origin) worked in the sawmill. His parents are Joseph and Dorothy Kovacevich. At Stanford University he received BS and MS degrees in industrial engineering, followed by an MBA degree from Stanford Business School in 1967.

==Career==
=== General Mills ===
Early in his corporate career, Kovacevich was a strategic planner with General Mills. He became chief financial officer of Palitoy, a UK company acquired by General Mills, and later general manager of General Mills&#x27; Kenner Products.

=== Citicorp ===
Kovacevich joined Citibank in 1975, where he ran mortgage, consumer finance and other retail operations in New York state. At Citi he rolled out the company&#x27;s automated teller machine (ATM) network. He is credited with turning around Citi&#x27;s New York branch system and doubling the market share of Citi&#x27;s credit card business. Kovacevich left Citibank in 1986, after being passed over for Citigroup&#x27;s top consumer banking job.

=== Norwest / Wells Fargo ===

He then joined Norwest Bank as chief operating officer and head of the retail banking group in March 1986. At Norwest, Kovacevich confronted a similar situation. Norwest was mostly centered in Minnesota and Iowa at the time, with a relatively small population in both states. Kovacevich realized the only way he could keep growing the company would be to expand beyond banking services, into investment and insurance services as well. Kovacevich theorized that eventually it would be impossible for any bank to continuously grow if it did not do this.

Kovacevich instituted the new strategies while serving as president of Norwest from 1989, chief executive officer from 1993, and chairman from 1995. The higher revenues, relative to stable fixed costs which this method produced allowed Norwest to purchase many other banks, culminating with the 1998 purchase of Wells Fargo. Although Norwest was effectively the survivor, the merged company retained the better-known Wells Fargo name and moved to Wells Fargo&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco. After the merger, Kovacevich was given the positions of president and CEO of Wells Fargo. In 2001 he was elected chairman as well.

He relinquished the presidency of Wells Fargo to John Stumpf in August 2005. On June 27, 2007, the board of directors elected Stumpf CEO, with Kovacevich retaining the chairmanship.

In September 2009 Wells Fargo announced Kovacevich would step down as chairman and a director at the end of 2009 and retire from the company in early 2010 after 23 years with Norwest and Wells Fargo. As of October, 2020, it was reported that he still had an office and personal assistant at Wells Fargo.

=== Other positions ===
Besides Wells Fargo, Kovacevich is a former Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc., and formerly Target Corporation. He is also vice president of the board of governors of the San Francisco Symphony, vice chairman of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and a member of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s California Commission on Jobs and Economic Growth, the National Infrastructure Advisory Committee, and the Financial Services Roundtable.

==== Hudson Executive Capital ====
In June 2015, it was announced that Kovacevich is a CEO partner and had invested in Hudson Executive Capital, LP, an activist hedge fund.

==== Theranos ====
Kovacevich joined the board of directors of Theranos in 2013 on the recommendation of George Shultz. The board of directors transitioned from an advisory role to a fiduciary one in mid-2016. Despite criticisms, Kovacevich defended Theranos as &quot;a good company&quot; and claimed the treatment of CEO Elizabeth Holmes was &quot;unfair.&quot; He resigned from the board in February 2017 and was deposed in 2018. He had invested over $4 million in the company.

==Personal life==
Kovacevich is married to Mary Jo and is the father of three children.

In the political realm, he has supported Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Kamala Harris.

<doc id="707337" wikidata="Q1589279" url="?curid=707337" title="Haughton impact crater">
<text>Haughton impact crater is located on Devon Island, Nunavut in far Northern Canada. It is about in diameter and was formed 31–32 million years ago during the Early Oligocene. The impacting object is estimated to have been approximately in diameter. Devon Island itself is composed of Paleozoic shale and siltstone overlying gneissic bedrock. When the crater formed, the shale and siltstone were peeled back to expose the basement; material from as deep as has been identified.

== Description ==

At 75° north latitude, it is one of the highest-latitude impact craters known. The temperature is below the freezing point of water for much of the year, and the limited vegetation is slow-growing, leading to very little weathering. For this reason Haughton retains many geological features that lower-latitude craters lose to erosion.

Because Haughton&#x27;s geology and climatology are as close to Mars-like as can be had on Earth, Haughton and its environs have been dubbed by scientists working there as &quot;Mars on Earth&quot;. For example, the centre of the crater contains impact breccia (ejected rock which has fallen back into the impact zone and partially re-welded) that is permeated with permafrost, thus creating a close analogue to what may be expected at crater sites on a cold, wet Mars. The Mars Institute and the SETI Institute operate the Haughton–Mars Project at this site, designed to test many of the challenges of life and work on Mars. The non-profit Mars Society also operates the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station (FMARS) at this site and conducts similar research.

<text>The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences is the first of the five Nanoscale Science Research Centers sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. It is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and is a collaborative research facility for the synthesis, characterization, theory/ modeling/ simulation, and design of nanoscale materials. It is co-located with Spallation Neutron Source.

==Science==

The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a United States Department of Energy / Office of Science Nanoscale Science Research Center operating as a collaborative and multidisciplinary user research facility. The CNMS is one of five Department of Energy nanoscale centers that form an integrated national user network. Each of the five is associated with other major national research facilities at one of Department of Energy&#x27;s national laboratories, enabling their application to nanoscale science and technology.
To accomplish this, the CNMS integrates nanoscale science with three national needs: 
*Neutron science, using the Spallation Neutron Source, and the recently upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor.
*Synthesis science, also called “science-driven synthesis,” facilitated by extensive and novel synthesis capabilities in the CNMS&#x27; first five scientific themes (described below) and by a new nanofabrication research laboratory.
*Theory, modeling and simulation, through establishing a new nanomaterials theory institute, with close connections to the staff expertise and computational capabilities of Oak Ridge&#x27;s Center for Computational Sciences and the new national Leadership Scientific Computing Facility.

==Scientific themes==
Research in the CNMS is organized under seven related scientific themes and a nanofabrication research laboratory clean room) that have been selected to address challenges to scientific understanding as well as nanotechnology opportunities and needs.

* Macromolecular complex systems
* Functional nanomaterials
* Catalysis and nano-building blocks
* NanoPhysics: magnetism, transport, and scanning probes
* Bio-inspired nanomaterials
* Nanomaterials Theory Institute: theory, modeling, and simulation
* Nanoscale Structure and Dynamics: neutrons, electrons, and X-rays
* Nanofabrication research laboratory

==Facility and capabilities==
The CNMS is housed in a new 80,000-square foot building on Chestnut Ridge adjacent to the Spallation Neutron Source. Construction of the facility began in August 2003 and was completed in April 2005, with the research program beginning operation in October 2005. The four-level main building comprises wet and dry laboratories, office space, and common areas to promote interaction among staff, long-term research guests, and users. It is equipped with a wide range of specialized tools for synthesis, characterization, and integration of hard and soft materials. The 10,000-square foot nanofabrication research laboratory, housed in a one-level wing of the building, includes clean rooms and an area designed to meet the requirements of electron beam imaging and writing instruments (low electromagnetic field, low vibration, low acoustic noise). The Nanomaterials Theory Institute provides collaborative work spaces, visualization equipment, and high-speed connections to the terascale computing facilities of Oak Ridge&#x27;s National Center for Computational Sciences and the national Leadership Scientific Computing Facility. The intense neutron beams of the Spallation Neutron Source and of the recently upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor afford unique opportunities for fundamental studies of the structure and dynamics of nanoscale materials. The CNMS provides a gateway to these and other Oak Ridge user facilities, including electron microscopy, for users whose research can benefit from access to multiple facilities.

==User research program==
The CNMS user program provides access to equipment for nanoscale research and engineering. Access is through brief user research proposals that are peer-reviewed by an external Proposal Review Committee. Nanoscience user activities were initiated during 2003, prior to completion of the CNMS building, with the first CNMS &quot;Jump Start&quot; Call for Proposals (July–August 2003).

<doc id="707344" wikidata="Q2622002" url="?curid=707344" title="Abolition of feudalism in France">
<text>One of the central events of the French Revolution was the abolition of feudalism, and the old rules, taxes, and privileges left over from the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. The National Constituent Assembly, after deliberating on the night of 4 August 1789, announced, &quot;The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.&quot; It abolished both the seigneurial rights of the Second Estate (the nobility) and the tithes gathered by the First Estate (the Catholic clergy). The old judicial system, founded on the 13 regional parlements, was suspended in November 1789, and finally abolished in 1790.

==Background==
The fall of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was followed by a mass uproar spreading from Paris to the countryside. Noble families were attacked and many aristocratic manors were burned. Abbeys and castles were also attacked and destroyed. The season of &quot;La Grande Peur&quot; – the Great Fear – was characterised by social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim. In many cases, the violence was begun not by homeless people or hunger-driven peasants but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.

The Great Fear opened up the vulnerability of the French government – there was a lack of authority at the very center of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to a general anxiety that things might get out of control, and they did. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.

By late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the Assembly decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the Assembly abolished the feudal system, and eliminated many clerical and noble rights and privileges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.

==The debates in the Assembly==
On 4 August 1789, the Duke of Aiguillon proposed in the Club Breton the abolition of feudal rights and the suppression of personal servitude. On the evening of 4 August, the Viscount de Noailles proposed to abolish the privileges of the nobility to restore calm in French provinces.

Members of the First Estate were at first reluctant to enter into the patriotic fervour of the night but eventually Anne Louis Henri de La Fare (then Bishop of Nancy) and the Bishop of Chartres sacrificed their titles. Guy Le Guen de Kerangal, the Viscount de Beauharnais, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph de Lubersac, and de La Fare proposed to suppress the banalités, seigneurial jurisdictions, game-laws and ecclesiastic privileges.

==August decrees==

The August Decrees were nineteen decrees made on 4–11 August 1789 by the National Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution. There were 18 decrees or articles adopted concerning the abolition of feudalism, other privileges of the nobility, and seigneurial rights. There were nineteen decrees in all, with a revised list published on 11 August.

Article 1 – The Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the &quot;existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel (this refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by English copyholders), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification&quot;. All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the Assembly. Those dues that were not removed by this decree were to be collected as usual until indemnification took place.

Article 2 – The exclusive right of &quot;fuies&quot; (allowing birds to graze) and dovecotes is abolished. The pigeons will be locked up during times determined by the communities. During these periods, they will be considered prey, and anyone will be allowed to kill them on their properties.

Article 3 – The exclusive rights of keeping unenclosed warrens were abolished as well. Every landowner shall have the rights to destroy all kinds of game in their own land. However, public safety regulations must be maintained by them. All hunting spaces, including the royal forest, and all hunting rights were similarly abolished as well. There were provisions made for the king&#x27;s hunting, however, for his personal pleasure in it. The president of the Assembly was commissioned to ask of the king the release of those people who were sent to prison or exiled for the violation of the previously existing hunting rights.

Article 4 – All the Manorial Courts were suppressed, but the judges and other officials of justice were allowed to continue with their duties until further instructions from the Assembly.

Article 5 – Any kind of tithes, as well as any substitution for them were abolished. Whosoever possessed them,&quot;…secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons, and those substituted for the portion congrue (this expression refers to the minimum remuneration fixed for the priests), are abolished, on condition, however, that some other method be devised to provide for the expenses of divine worship, the support of the officiating clergy, for the assistance of the poor, for repairs and rebuilding of churches and parsonages, and for the maintenance of all institutions, seminaries, schools, academies, asylums, and organizations to which the present funds are devoted&quot;. Until these provisions were made, the Assembly allowed the priests to collect the tithes. All the other tithes, which were not abolished under this law, were to be collected as usual.

Article 6 – All sorts of ground rents were redeemable at a price the Assembly fixed. No dues were to be created in the future that were irredeemable.

Article 7 – The sale of judicial and municipal offices was abolished. Justice should be dispensed freely. However, all such magistrates were to do their duty until further instructions from the Assembly.

Article 8 – As soon as the portion congrue was increased, the fees of all parish priests and curates were abolished.

Article 9 – Fiscal privileges in the payment of taxes were abolished forever. Taxes were to be collected from all the citizens, in exactly the same manner, and plans were to be considered to set up a new method of tax collection.

Article 10 – All particular privileges given to certain provinces, district, cities, cantons and communes, financial or otherwise, were abolished because under the new rules, every part of France was equal.

Article 11 – All citizens, no matter what class or birth he might be, were eligible for any office in civil and military service.

Article 12 – No allowances were to be made for &quot;…annates or for any other purpose to the court of Rome, the vice legation at Avignon, or to the nunciature at Lucerne&quot;. The clergy should apply to their bishops for financial donations and benefits, which shall be given free to any church of France.

Article 13 – Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the Assembly.

Article 14 – The revenue limited to the clergies were restricted to the sum of three thousand livres. Any individual could not enjoy the benefits of several pensions at the same time, if the pensions that he already enjoyed was more than three thousand livres.

Article 15 – The King and the Assembly would together consider all the reports that were to be presented with regards to pensions, favors and salaries, and would have a right to suppress or reduce that which was undeserved.

Article 16 – A medal was to be struck in the memory of the important deliberations for the welfare of France, and &quot;…a Te Deum shall be chanted in gratitude in all the parishes and the churches of France&quot;.

Article 17 – King Louis XVI was proclaimed the Restorer of French Liberty.

Article 18 – The Assembly was to present itself as a body before the king and submit this important set of decrees, and Te Deum was to be sung in the chapel of the king.

Article 19 – As soon as possible, the Assembly was to give grave consideration to the drawing up of the laws that would help carry out these decrees.

==Analysis by historians==
Historian Georges Lefebvre summarizes the night&#x27;s work:
In the course of a few hours, France abolished game-laws, manorial courts, venal offices (especially judgeships), the purchase and sale of pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, of surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions. Towns, provinces, companies, and cities also sacrificed their special privileges. A medal was struck to commemorate the day, and the Assembly declared Louis XVI the &quot;Restorer of French Liberty&quot;. François Furet emphasizes that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of the founding texts of modern France.

This &quot;Saint Bartholomew of abuses&quot;, as François Mignet calls it, has often been the subject of hyperbole in the analyses of contemporaries and historians. The atmosphere inside the Assembly was so heady that confusion reigned in the provinces for months afterwards as to the true meaning of the laws. The real product of the night was not formalised until the Feudal Committee reported back on 5 March 1790. The Committee reintroduced the &quot;mainmorte&quot; (explicitly outlawed by the original decrees) and set a rate of redemption for rights related to land that was impossible for the majority of peasants to pay (30 times the annual rent).

The Russian anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin wrote:
Kropotkin concludes &quot;The Feudal rights remain&quot; and scorns the other historians: &quot;The historic legend is lovingly used to embellish this night, and the majority of historians, copying the story as it has been given by a few contemporaries, represent it as a night full of enthusiasm and saintly abnegation.&quot;

==Impact==
The August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years. King Louis XVI, in a letter, on the one hand expressed deep satisfaction with &quot;the noble and generous demarche of the first two orders of the state&quot; who, according to him had &quot;made great sacrifices for the general reconciliation, for their patrie and for their king&quot;. On the other hand, he went on to say that though the &quot;sacrifices were fine, I cannot admire it; I will never consent to the despoliation of my clergy and my nobility ... I will never give my sanction to the decrees that despoil them, for then the French people one day could accuse me of injustice or weakness&quot;. What Louis was concerned with was not with the loss of position of the French nobility and clergy, but with adequate reparation for this loss. Meanwhile, the August Decrees paved the way for the Assembly to make the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

Originally, the peasants were supposed to pay for the release of seigneurial dues; these dues affected more than a quarter of the farmland in France and provided most of the income of the large landowners. The majority refused to pay and in 1793 the obligation was cancelled. Thus the peasants got their land free, and also no longer paid the tithe to the church.

D. M. G. Sutherland has examined the results for peasants and landlords. The peasants no longer had to pay the tithe to the Church. The landowners, however, were now allowed to raise rents by the same amount as the former tithe. The national government then taxed away the new income to owners by raising land taxes. Sutherland concludes that the peasants effectively paid twice, in terms of higher rents and heavier taxes. Many tried to evade the burden. In the long run, however, the new burdens on the tenants and landlords were largely offset by major gains in productivity, which made everyone richer.

<doc id="707347" wikidata="Q1884089" url="?curid=707347" title="Magic smoke">
<text>Magic smoke (also factory smoke, blue smoke, or the genie) is a humorous name for the caustic smoke produced by severe electrical over-stress of electronic circuits or components, causing overheating and an accompanying release of smoke. The smoke typically smells of burning plastic and other chemicals. The color of the smoke depends on which component is overheating, but it is commonly blue, grey, or white. Minor overstress eventually results in component failure, but without pyrotechnic display or release of smoke. A power transistor inside a power supply is a frequent culprit for the acrid smoke.

The name is a running in-joke that started among electrical engineers and technicians, which was later adopted by programmers and computer scientists. The jargon file, a compendium of historical and current hacker jargon, defines:
magic smoke: n.

A substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them to function (also called blue smoke; this is similar to the archaic phlogiston hypothesis about combustion). Its existence is demonstrated by what happens when a chip burns up: the magic smoke gets out, whereupon the chip ceases to function, hence the smoke is essential for the chip&#x27;s function.
The device operates as long as the magic smoke is trapped inside of it, but when the smoke escapes from it, the device ceases to operate. Post hoc ergo propter hoc the smoke (a sort of élan vital) is an essential part of the device and its operation via undetermined (&quot;magical&quot;) means.

==Usage==

This has led to phrases (and variants of) &quot;You let the smoke out!&quot;, &quot;The magic smoke is escaping.&quot; or &quot;I think you set your power supply too high; there is magic smoke coming from that resistor!&quot; as euphemisms for the destruction of a component by overheating.

When a device is powered on for the first time it is sometimes called a &quot;smoke test&quot;, as any purely electrical defects would be revealed. 

Red Hat Linux 6.1 included the following text in the hardware compatibility guide:

Tier 3 Incompatible and Unsupported CPUs

* Smokeless CPUs: Smokeless CPUs are incompatible with the linux kernel and it is doubted that any work will ever be performed to change this. They are simply too unreliable in even the most standard system configuration. Those with a CPU missing its Magic Smoke should switch to a new CPU.
The joke in the above quotation is the concept of a &quot;Smokeless CPU&quot;—one in which the vital magic smoke has been released, rendering it inoperable. The joke remained in Red Hat 6.2, but was removed in a subsequent version.

<text>Warwick Mountain is a mountain in Alberta, Canada.

It is located south of Warwick Creek in the Athabasca River Valley of Jasper National Park. It stands east of the Chaba Icefield and north of the Columbia Icefield.

The mountain was named in 1919 by Arthur O. Wheeler after Warwick Castle in England when he noted the castellated appearance of the mountain and it being situated just north of Mt. King Edward.

<doc id="707361" wikidata="Q2724537" url="?curid=707361" title="Sattriya">
<text>Sattriya, or &quot;Sattriya Nritya&quot;, is a major Indian classical dance. It was initially created as part of Bhaona which are performances of &quot;Ankiya Nat&quot;, one-act plays, originally created by Sankardev, a 15th-16th century polymath from Assam. These dances are part of the living traditions today of &quot;Sattra&quot;, which are communities of live-in devotees belonging to the &quot;Ekasarana Dharma&quot;, a Hindu sect established by Sankardev.

The themes played are related to Krishna, as well as other avatars of Vishnu such as Rama, and stories from the epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

On November 15 of the year 2000, the Sangeet Natak Akademi of India recognised &quot;Sattriya&quot; as one of the eight classical dances of India. Modern &quot;Sattriya&quot; explores many themes and plays, and its performances are staged worldwide.

== History ==
&quot;Sattriya&quot; is a classical dance of India, tracing its roots to ancient drama and music texts of India, particularly Bharata Muni&#x27;s Nātya Śāstra. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Nātya Śāstra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances.

 Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues, and the essence of scriptures.

The history of dance arts in Assam goes back to antiquity, as evidenced by copper plate inscriptions and sculpture relating to Shaivism and Shaktism traditions. Singing and musical traditions, similarly, have been traced to Assamese chorus singing tradition for the Hindu epics: the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

The modern form of Sattriya is attributed to the 15th century Sankaradeva, who systematized the dance using the ancient texts, and introduced drama and expressive dancing (&quot;nritta&quot; and &quot;nritya&quot;) as a form of a community religious art for emotional devotion to Krishna.

Since the 15th century, the Sattriya art grew as part of the Vaishnava bhakti movement, in Hindu monasteries called &quot;Sattra&quot;. The art was developed and practiced by monks in the form dance-dramas about legends and mythologies of Krishna, particularly from texts such as the Bhāgavata Purāna. One distinctive part of the Sattriya dance inside temples and monasteries is that the dance is not celebrated before any idol, but is performed before a copy of the Bhagavata Purana placed in eastern (sun rise) corner called &quot;Manikut&quot; of the dance hall (&quot;namghar&quot;).

These dance-dramas were, in the early days, written and directed by the Assamese poet-saint Sankaradeva, and by his principal disciple Madhavadeva. They were mostly composed during the 16th century. Once the domain of male monks, it is now performed by male as well as female dancers. In the second half of the 20th century, &quot;Sattriya Nritya&quot; moved from the sanctum of Assam&#x27;s &quot;sattras&quot; / monasteries to the metropolitan stage.

The Sangeet Natak Akademi recognized &quot;Sattriya Nritya&quot; as an official classical dance of India in 2000. &quot;Sattriyas&quot; are now performed on world&#x27;s stages.

==Repertoire==
Like the other schools of Indian Classical dance, &quot;Sattriya&quot; encompasses the principles required of a classical dance form: the treatises of dance and dramaturgy, like Nātya Śāstra, Abhinaya Darpana, and Śārngadeva&#x27;s Sangīta Ratnākara; The &quot;Sangīta Ratnākara&quot; of Śārngadeva complements his &quot;Bhakti Ratnakara&quot;, which traces the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Yoga and Vedanta themes, the ethical values such as non-violence (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya) and others, thus premising a theological foundation to Sattriya. To Shankaradeva, religious values, ethics, joys of life and performance arts were intimately linked, and he asked the leaders of Hindu monasteries to compose at least one play, during their tenure, before they die.

Sattriya repertoire (mārg) includes &quot;nritta&quot; (pure dance, solo), &quot;nritya&quot; (expressive dance, solo), and nātya (dramatic play, group). Like all major classical Indian dance forms, those three categories of performances are:
*The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement in Nritta, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretive aspect, no telling of story.
*The &quot;Nritya&quot; is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, story line particularly with spiritual themes. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the performance expands to include story-telling, the silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. This part of a repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.
*The &quot;Nātya&quot; is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A &quot;Nātya&quot; incorporates the elements of a &quot;Nritya&quot;. Kuchipudi historically relied on a team of dancer-actors, while in modern times Kuchipudi productions include solo or duo performances.

The hand gestures (&quot;mudras&quot;), footwork (&quot;padas&quot;), postures, rhythms, training of artistes and other aspects of the Sattriya dance drama closely follow those described in Nātya Śāstra and other classical Hindu dance texts, and are quite similar to other major classical dances such as Odishi, Kathakali, Bharatanātyam and others found in southern and northern India. Some basic elements and features of Sattriya match those found in the Manipuri dance found in neighboring Manipur state.

&quot;Sattriya Nritya&quot; is a genre of dance drama that tells mythical and religious stories through hand and face expressions. The basic dance unit and exercise of a Sattriya is called a &quot;Mati Akhara&quot;, equal 64 just like in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, are the foundational sets dancers learn during their training. The Akharas are subdivided into Ora, Saata, Jhalak, Sitika, Pak, Jap, Lon and Khar. A performance integrates two styles, one masculine (&quot;Paurashik Bhangi&quot;, energetic and with jumps), and feminine (&quot;Stri Bhangi&quot;, Lasya or delicate).

Traditionally, &quot;Sattriya&quot; was performed only by &quot;bhokot&quot;s (male monks) in monasteries as a part of their daily rituals or to mark special festivals. Today, in addition to this practice, &quot;Sattriya&quot; is also performed on stage by men and women who are not members of the &quot;sattras&quot;, on themes that go beyond the mythological.

The plays choreographed in a Sattriya are those found in Hindu texts such as the Bhāgavata Purāna, the Epics, and the compositions by Assamese scholars. 

===Dresses===

The dress of &quot;Sattriya&quot; dance is primarily of two types: the male dress comprising the &quot;dhoti,&quot; &quot;chadar&quot; and the &quot;paguri&quot; (turban) and the female dress comprising the &quot;ghuri&quot;, &quot;chadar&quot; and &quot;kanchi&quot; (waist cloth). Traditionally the dresses were of white or raw silk color with use of red, blue and yellow for specific dance numbers. In earlier times velvet and satin materials were mostly used for the dresses. With change of time, as this dance form evolved from the sattras onto stage, the design and materials of the dance dresses changed. Pat (also spelled paat) – a silk produced in Assam which is derived from the mulberry plant and muga silk (&quot;golden silk of Assam&quot;) is also used in preparing the dance dress. Other bright colours are also used in the female dresses. These hand-woven materials normally have intricate local motifs like &quot;Kingkhap, Miri Motif, Kolka&quot; etc.

Uses of play-specific dress are also seen in Sattriya dance. The dress of &quot;Krishna Nritya&quot; and &quot;Nadubhangi Nritya&quot; is of yellow and blue keeping in line with the attire of Lord Krishna. The &quot;Sutradhar Nritya&quot; also has its specific white dress with a special turban.

Traditional Assamese jewellery is used in Sattriya dance. The jewellery is made by a unique technique in &quot;Kesa Sun&quot; (raw gold). Artistes wear Kopali on the forehead, &quot;Muthi Kharu&quot; and &quot;Gam Kharu&quot; (bracelets), different type of neck pieces like &quot;Mata Moni&quot; (for male dancers), &quot;Golpata&quot;, &quot;Dhulbiri&quot; (shaped like the musical instrument dhol), &quot;Bena&quot; (pendant shaped like a crescent), &quot;Jethipata&quot; (lizard shaped), &quot;Dugdugi&quot; (leaf shaped), Senpata (eagle shaped), &quot;Dhansira&quot; (strand of rice grain) and &quot;Lokaparo&quot; (pigeon design). Earrings are made in similar designs and also &quot;Thuka Suna&quot; and &quot;Keru&quot; are worn by dancers. Female dancers wear white flowers in the hair.

The dresses of &quot;Ankiya Naats&quot; (dramas) are colourful and character specific. Use of &quot;Mukha&quot; (Masks) to depict demons and special characters are also unique of this dance form. The art of mask-making is an integral part of Sattriya culture and originated in the Sattras of Assam. Beautifully decorated turbans and crowns made by the local artisans are used in the &quot;Ankiya Naats&quot;.

The facial makeup of Sattriya dance resembles other classical dance forms of India. However, in earlier times traditional materials and herbs were used for make up.

===Music and instruments===
&quot;Sattriya Nritya&quot; is accompanied by musical compositions called &quot;bargeets&quot; (composed by Sankardeva and Shree Shree Madhavdev, among others) which are based on classical ragas.

A key musical instrument that accompanies a Sattriya performance is the &quot;khol&quot; (two-faced, asymmetrical drum quite different from the rest of India) played with fingers. The special shape and materials of construction – clay, wood, leather, rice dough, iron filings, rope straps – of Sattriya &quot;khol&quot; produces a high pitch with the right side (&quot;Daina&quot;), while producing a deep bass sound on the left (&quot;Bewa&quot;).

Accompanying the &quot;khol&quot; are various types of &quot;Tālas&quot; or cymbals (Manjira, Bhortal, Bihutal, Patital, Khutital) and the flute (bansuri). Other instruments like the violin and the harmonium have been recent additions.

===Styles===
A Sattriya performance comes in many styles such as the &quot;Sutradhara&quot; (or Sutra-bhangi), character specific &quot;Bhangi&quot;, &quot;Prabesh&quot;, &quot;Nritya&quot; and &quot;Jhumura&quot;. The &quot;Sutradhara&quot; is a style that tells a story and presents the spiritual values of Vaisnavism in a complete classical format: nritta, nritya and natya. One feature of the Sutradhara (or Sutradhari) style is the included commentary for the audience in local language.

&quot;Ankiya Nat&quot; is a subgenre consisting of one-act plays of &quot;Sattriya&quot;. These are dedicated compositions but feature a ballad, dance and drama.

The character specific different styles of Sattriya have their own dress variations, and focus on the various life stages and activities of Radha, Krishna and the gopis.

<text>El Perú (also known as Waka″), is a pre-Columbian Maya archeological site occupied during the Preclassic and Classic cultural chronology periods (roughly 500 BC to 800 AD). The site was the capital of a Maya city-state and is located near the banks of the San Pedro River in the Department of Petén of northern Guatemala. El Perú is west of Tikal.

==Research==
The Maya city of Waka&#x27; was rediscovered by oil prospectors in the 1960s. In the 1970s Ian Graham, a Harvard researcher, documented monuments at the site. Then in 2003 David Freidel, of Southern Methodist University, and Héctor Escobedo, of the University of San Carlos, began to excavate Waka&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The site was named &quot;El Perú&quot; when rediscovered in the twentieth century. Maya glyphs identified and deciphered at the site have indicated that the ancient name for the site was &quot;Waka&#x27;.&quot; While both names are currently used interchangeably, El Perú predominates on extant maps. In the published literature, a conflated name is generally used, El Perú-&quot;Waka&#x27;.&quot;

==History==
The first recorded meeting between Teotihuacan and the Maya occurred at Waka&#x27; in 378, 10 days prior to their arrival at Tikal. This moment is known among Mesoamerican archaeologists as “La Entrada.” During the early phases of the Early Classic, Waka’ was allied with Tikal.

Waka’, however, later betrayed Tikal and forged a political alliance with Calakmul. This alliance was solidified by K&#x27;inich Balam (“Sun Faced Jaguar”), who ruled from the late 7th century to the early 8th century and was married to Lady T&#x27;abi, a princess from Calakmul, capital of the Kan dynasty at the time. This union was a political maneuver that linked El Peru (K’inich Balam) to Calakmul and its leader Yuknom Cheen in a military alliance. Lady T’abi was later given the title &quot;ix kaloomté&quot; (&quot;empress&quot; or &quot;warlord”), a high title used in ancient Maya texts. Yuknom Cheen was attempting to gather several Maya kingdoms into a larger polity.

Waka&#x27;s downfall was likely initiated by its alliance with Calakmul. Following Tikal&#x27;s re-emergence from its hiatus in the Late Classic, Calakmul fell to its military might. Calakmul&#x27;s ruler Yuknoom Took&#x27; K&#x27;awiil, likely the brother of Lady T&#x27;abi, was defeated, captured, and sacrificed in Tikal&#x27;s central plaza in 732. Tikal&#x27;s ruler Yik&#x27;in Chan K&#x27;awiil defeated Waka&#x27; in 743. Waka’ was converted into a vassal state of Tikal. After this victory Yik&#x27;in Chan K&#x27;awiil took an image of a celestial serpent from Waka&#x27; and brought it to Tikal. According to Robert Sharer, the celestial serpent was possibly Waka&#x27;s patron deity. Evidence for Yik&#x27;in Chan K&#x27;awiil&#x27;s act can be found on Tikal&#x27;s Temple IV. Not a year later he defeated Naranjo. Waka&#x27; was eventually destroyed a decade later, an event that included the capture and sacrifice of K&#x27;inich Balam&#x27;s successor.

==Trading Power==
As a trading power, Waka&#x27; held proximity to the San Pedro River which flowed westward from the Petén. Waka also had access to a north–south overland route. This route connected south Campeche and the Petén. The close location to the dominant Maya capitals Calakmul and Tikal contributed to the trading power of Waka&#x27;. Waka&#x27;s market included maize, beans, chili peppers, avocados, chicle, and latex. Waka&#x27;, also, obtained jade and quetzal feathers, used for costumes.

==Population and Layout==
Around 400, Waka&#x27; had a population containing tens of thousands people. According to Chris Hardman in &quot;Woman Power in the Maya World&quot;, this was the political peak of the city. The reason for the high population was the ideal location and trading power of the city.

The city included hundreds of buildings, four plazas, and ceremonial centers.
Archaeologists have divided El Perú into different groups and plazas. Plaza 1 is in the center of the site. Other plazas, built neighboring Plaza 1, include residence compounds. The Northwest group is located near Plaza 1 and a ballcourt. The Paal group can be found near Plaza 2 and south of Plaza 1. South east of Plaza 1 are the Chok and Tolok groups. Just below these groups is the Mirador Complex.

==Recent discoveries==
A number of tombs have recently been discovered at Waka&#x27; that contribute to the understanding of past Maya culture. One that is particularly important is the “Queen’s Tomb.” This feature contains the remains of a female in a tomb containing a rich assortment of grave goods. Of particular importance is the presence of a bloodletting paraphernalia in the form of a ceremonial stingray spine. This object was in clear association with the individual&#x27;s genital region, and indicates that royal women practiced genitalia bloodletting rituals.

An additional tomb for an elite individual was recently found within an 18 meter tall pyramid located in the site&#x27;s central core. The tomb&#x27;s chamber, which is 5.1 meters long by 1.5 meters wide, contained a rich assemblage of grave goods, including jade offerings, shell artifacts, ceramic vessels, 12 ballgame player figurines, the paws of jaguar, and stones from the Eastern Highlands and the Pacific Lowlands, which were used as signs of wealth. The early date of the tomb, between c. 200 and 400, indicates Waka&#x27;s early regional importance in the southern Maya lowlands.

Recent research at the site of Zapote Bobal suggests a strong connection between that site and El Perú. It is possible that El Perú may have had a strong influence on the dynasty centered at Zapote Bobal.

===Emblem Glyph===

====Early Classic====
The Early Classic period emblem glyph of El Perú consists of an Ajaw glyph connected to a zoomorphic head. According to Stanley Paul Guenter, this is similar to the Chapa(h)t logogram. Guenter also believes the zoomorphic head represents a centipede or creature with a face like a centipede&#x27;s. The main sign of this glyph says &quot;Wak&quot;. Guenter says this could be a word used for centipede however there is little evidence for this in previous knowledge of Mayan.

====Late Classic====
The Late classic shows a transition from iconographic logogram usage for the emblem glyph to use of syllables to spell out the name.

The &quot;Snake Head Emblem&quot; was originally thought to represent El Perú. This idea came from a pair of looted stelea Ian Graham said came from the site. Scholars David Stuart, Stephen Houston, and others have found a different emblem glyph they believe provides a better representation of El Perú during the Late Classic.

Simon Martin was the first to study this glyph in 2000. The emblem includes two hieroglyphs. The first glyph contains three different signs. The K&#x27;uh sign is a prefix for the glyph and according to Stanley Paul Guenter of Southern Methodist University the sign is used to represent something &quot;divine.&quot; A male head with a spot on his cheek makes up the second part of the hieroglyph. Guenter says this is most likely a representation of the maize god. Above the head&#x27;s ear is a K&#x27;in sign. On top of the male head is a sign David Stuart, and Stephen Houston read as Nal. Guenter says the sign requires further study before it can be legitimately read as Nal.

The second hieroglyph also contains three signs. The glyph includes an Ajaw, a leadership title, superfix. Below this sign is the syllable &quot;ka&quot;. The syllable &quot;wa&quot; makes the third sign. Simon Martin says this glyph should be read as &quot;Wak Ajaw&quot;. He has identified &quot; Waka&#x27; &quot; as the ancient toponym for El Perú. In Stanley Paul Guenter&#x27;s article, &quot;Emblem Glyph of El Perú&quot; he says &quot;-a&#x27; &quot; refers to the Maya word used for water. Therefore, Waka&#x27; means &quot;Wak-water&quot; or &quot;Wak-place.&quot; The possible meanings for &quot;wak&quot; include the number six or the description of a location on an escarpment. The latter possibility comes from &quot;wa&quot;&#x27; meaning &quot;stood up.&quot;

Kings in the Late Classic differed from Early Classic because they attached a second part to the emblem. This second part recognized new rulers and an alliance with Calakmul.

===Stela 15===
Stela 15 is a monument containing only Maya glyphs. Stanley Gunter dates the stela to 416. The monument contains the names of rulers back until the mid 4th century. The monument also describes how a foreign war leader Siyaj K&#x27;ahk, or Siyaj K&#x27;ak&#x27; came to Waka&#x27; during January of 378. According to epigrapher David Stuart (Mayanist), this stela supports the idea of Siyaj K&#x27;ahk&#x27; traveling through Waka&#x27; roughly eight days before taking over Tikal&#x27;s government.

===Stela 16===
Stela 16 was first sketched by Ian Graham in the early 1970s and later in 2004 by David Freidel.

The monument, found a few yards away from Stela 15, shows a man wearing a headdress and royal outfit similar to rulers of Teotihuacan. The man holds a bird-headed staph on his right and a bundle on his left. David Freidel suggests the bird head is a symbol for &quot;Spearthrower Owl.&quot; This was one name used for a certain king of Teotihuacan, and the father of Siyaj K&#x27;ahk&#x27;. Epigrapher Stanley Guenter deciphered part of the Maya script on Stela 16 and believes it says &quot;planted [his] banner stone, Siyaj K&#x27;ahk&quot;. Freidel thinks this monument is a depiction of the war leader many years after he had traveled through Waka&#x27;.

===Stela 30===
The text of stela 30 describes the contact of El Perú&#x27;s king Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife to the king Jaguar-Paw, of Calakmul. The stela says they participated, along with other kings from western kingdoms, in the ritual of accession for Jaguar-Paw. One of these kings may have included Flint-Sky-God K of Dos Pilas, well known for his many captives. The stela describes how Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife were a part of the period-ending rites and displayed the God K scepter to Jaguar-Paw. Stela 30 also gives proof of Jaguar-Paw&#x27;s visits to El Perú.

===Stela 34===
This stela portrays a woman identified as Lady K&#x27;abel who is described as a lady warlord. She was the wife of king K&#x27;inich B&#x27;ahlam II and daughter of the Calakmul king Yuknoom Yich&#x27;aak K&#x27;ak&#x27;. The stela was found by a looter in the 1960s. It is believed to be dated to 692. Stela 34 would have been situated in one of the plazas.

===Lady K&#x27;abel&#x27;s Tomb===
In 2004 tomb, dating between 650 and 750, was discovered by José Ambrosio Díaz. This tomb holds the remains of a high status woman. The tomb was identified as a royal tomb due to the amount of jade. Archaeologists believe the tomb may belong to Lady K&#x27;abel because the items within the tomb are similar to the image of her on Stela 34. The tomb was found in the main courtyard, under a building. Within the tomb were 23 vessels used for offerings, beads, shells, and a &quot;huunal&quot; jewel. This jewel was often placed on &quot;ko&#x27;haws&quot;, helmets. These helmets were worn by war leaders. This suggests the woman was more powerful than most women of her time. Archaeologists do not believe this helmet necessarily means she was a war leader. It is more likely she was acting as a guardian of items used in battle.

===Tomb of Two Women===
In 2005 archaeologists Michelle Rich and Jennifer Piehl found the remains of two, possibly royal, women. The tomb is 4 feet high and 6.5 feet long. The two women were laid on top of each other with their backs touching. The woman on the bottom was pregnant. At the time of their death they were between the ages of 25 and 35. These women are believed to be royal because of their great condition of health and the vessels within their tomb. Rich believes these women were sacrificed by a new ruler who sought to eliminate the current family in power.

===Burial #39===
In 2006, Field Director Michelle Rich and her team discovered a collapsed tomb of a supposed ruler who died in the early 7th century. Burial #39 was located at pyramid O14-04 in the &quot;adosada&quot;, also known as the front platform. The tomb was sealed by a stone wall which took the archaeologists five days to remove. The artifacts within this tomb include painted and carved bones, mosaics, jade, mirrors, snake-like figurines, and ceramic figurines. The value of the items within this burial suggest the individual was a king. The king ruled after Muwaan Bahlam and before K&#x27;inich Bahlam II.

====23 Ceramic Figurines====
Within Burial #39 a group of 23 figurines were found. In David Freidel&#x27;s article, &quot;Resurrecting the Maize King&quot;, he discusses how these figurines are a depiction of a royal court performing a ceremony. More specifically the figures show a king kneeling with his arms crossed. The king figure&#x27;s hair is similar to that of the [Maize God]. Freidel therefore names the unknown deceased individual the Maize King. Beside the king is a deer spirit, possibly healing the king. This deer spirit may have been the &quot;way&quot;, spirit companion, of a different king watching the ceremony.

A figurine of a female singer conjures the deer spirit. Evidence for this includes the pigtail associated with shaman. She is also full of a red paint, thought to be the color of life. She holds sticks under her arm which may have been quill pens or used for counting. 
Beside the singer is a dwarf wearing a headdress similar to a deer. The dwarf is holding a shell trumpet which may have been used to conjure the deer from the underworld. Above the dwarf is a toad, often symbolic of birth in [ancient Maya] culture. Two other dwarf figurines are wearing helmets and look as if they are about to fight. Freidel suggests they might be boxers. Karl Taube, of the University of California, and Marc Zender, of Harvard University, believe boxing may have been a sport of ancient Meso-America.

Two figures, thought to be the successor of Waka&#x27; and his queen, are situated on the left of the deer spirit. The king figure is called Scribe King because his headdress resembles a monkey and the monkey gods were associated with scribes. The headdress contains a green mask inside a red seashell, held by a thumb. Freidel says this represents life rising from the underworld and the resurrection of the dead ruler&#x27;s soul.

====Olmec Style Figurine====
Another notable item found in Burial #39 includes an Olmec-like figurine. The figurine was found north of the buried ruler&#x27;s head. It was located inside two lip-to-lip cache vessels. The inside of these vessels were coated with a red pigment partially made of cinnabar. According to Michelle Rich, ancient Maya associated cinnabar coated caches, containing offerings, with resurrecting rulers, more specifically the maize god. A trefoil sprout on the crown of the figurine provides further evidence of a connection to the maize god. According to Michelle Rich this is used as a symbol for the maize god.

The figurine has one leg up, possibly showing dance movement. The left arm is bent and the right arm is missing. The top of the figurine&#x27;s head forms a fin. This represents either a fish or shark. The mouth of the figurine resembles a jaguar&#x27;s and contains a tooth much like a shark tooth. The crescent shape of the eyes are similar to the Olmec death god’s eyes, connecting the figurine to death. The low eye-lids of the figurine show a cross-bands motif on the right and a U shape on the left. These are often used as symbols of kingship. The figurine also has an engraving of the quatrefoil motif on the back. This suggests the figurine provides a way into the supernatural world.

The figurine is believed to be an heirloom of a dancing boy, representative of resurrection. This figurine was an important discovery because it is evidence that the ancient Maya knew about the Olmec maize god.

===Tolok Group Deposit===
A deposit was found near the main residential compound, referred to as N14-2 by excavators, of the Tolok group. This deposit contained the remains of two individuals, a two-year-old in burial #18 and a middle aged male in burial #19. The man was found under the staircase of N14-2 and had tabular modification of his skull. The two individuals had each been placed between two rocks and buried on top of broken ceramics. It is possible the deceased were sacrifices. Along with these individuals were items that suggested to researches the deposit was used for a ritual feasting event, important for establishing social position. The items included many bowls, plates, vases, bones of animals, ceramic figurines of a jaguar head and monkey wearing a headdress, and musical instruments. Keith Eppich of Southern Methodist University believes the items were intentionally broken in the deposit for the feasting ritual. The location of the deposit gives further indication of a feasting ritual. The ritual occurred at the stairs of N 14-2, a common location for the dedication ritual called Och-Otot which means &quot;enters house.&quot; This ritual was an act of paying debt to otherworldly powers and was often used with the construction of new architecture. Eppich says the two individuals were sacrificed and then became the &quot;soul&quot; of the building, N14-2.

===Maya Warrior Queen===

In October 2012, the suspected tomb and remains of an important Maya queen were discovered at the site. During excavations led by David Freidel of Washington University in St. Louis uncovered a tomb in the city&#x27;s main pyramid temple and it was identified as belonging to Lady Ka’bel, the military ruler of the Wak kingdom between AD672 and 692. The body inside was buried with various offerings, including “ceramic vessels, jade jewellery, stone figurines, and a small alabaster jar carved in the shape of a conch shell, out of which the carved head and arms of an old woman emerge”. Maya hieroglyphs on the back of the jar include the names &quot;Lady Water Lily Hand&quot; and &quot;Lady Snake Lord&quot;, according to the study team. Both names are thought to refer to Lady K&#x27;abel, who governed the Wak kingdom for her family, the empire-building Kan, or &quot;Snake&quot;, dynasty, based in the Maya capital Calakmul.

===El Peru altar===
An altar has been discovered at El Peru, featuring a quatrefoil on the back of a zoomorphic creature in which sits a ruler.
&quot;While the imagery bears remarkable similarities to that of Izapa Stela 8, the text of the El Peru altar elucidates the significance of the quatrefoil, describing it as &quot;tu yol ahk&quot;, &#x27;at the heart of the turtle&#x27; or &#x27;in the portal of the turtle&#x27;, a reference to the creation narrative of the Maize god&#x27;s rebirth&quot;.
==El Perú today==
While open to the public, Waka&#x27; is a difficult site to get to. It sits atop an escarpment in the Laguna del Tigre National Park (part of the Maya Biosphere Reserve), six kilometers north of the San Pedro River. The site can be reached via an arduous route from Flores, the closest town with an airport (the Mundo Maya International Airport).

<text>Katha Pollitt (born October 14, 1949) is an American poet, essayist and critic. She is the author of four essay collections and two books of poetry. Her writing focuses on political and social issues from a left-leaning perspective, including abortion, racism, welfare reform, feminism, and poverty.

==Early life and education==
Pollitt was born in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Her father was a lawyer and her mother was an agent involved in real estate. Her parents encouraged Pollitt to pursue her interest in poetry. Her father was Protestant and her mother was Jewish. Pollitt wrote extensively of her family in &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;, which is dedicated to her parents.

Pollitt earned a B.A. in philosophy from Radcliffe College in 1972 and an M.F.A. in writing from Columbia University in 1975. During her time at Harvard, she was involved with Students for a Democratic Society and took part, along with Jared Israel, in the student strike and shut down of 1969.

==Professional life==
Pollitt is best known for her bimonthly column &quot;Subject to Debate&quot; in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine. Her writing has also featured in publications such as &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. Her poetry has been republished in many anthologies and magazines, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the 2006 &quot;Oxford Book of American Poetry&quot;. She has appeared on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Charlie Rose, The McLaughlin Group, CNN, Dateline NBC and the BBC.

Much of Pollitt&#x27;s writing is in defense of contemporary feminism and other forms of identity politics and tackles perceived misimpressions by critics from across the political spectrum; other frequent topics include abortion, the media, U.S. foreign policy, the politics of poverty (especially welfare reform), and human rights movements around the world.

Pollitt coined the phrase &quot;The Smurfette Principle&quot; in 1991, in which she typifies the cartoon character Smurfette as the &quot;lone female&quot; in a group of males who is often a stereotypic figure.

In 2003, she was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. In 2020, she was one of the signers of the &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; Letter, which expressed support for protests for social justice while criticizing the growing number of disproportionately severe punishments for perceived slights or offenses.

On May 20, 2020, Pollitt said she would vote for Joe Biden in the presidential election, even &quot;if he boiled babies and ate them&quot;.

==Publications==
===Essay collections===
In 1994, Pollitt published &quot;Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism&quot; (Vintage), a collection of nineteen essays that first appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot; and other journals. The book&#x27;s title was a reference to a line in Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s 1794 treatise, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; – &quot;I wish to see women neither heroines nor brutes; but reasonable creatures.&quot;

Most of her &quot;Nation&quot; essays from 1994 to 2001 were collected in &quot;Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics and Culture&quot;, published by the Modern Library in 2001.

On June 13, 2006, Random House published her book &quot;Virginity or Death!: And Other Social and Political Issues of Our Time&quot;, a further collection of her &quot;Nation&quot; columns.

In 2007, Pollitt published &quot;Learning to Drive: And Other Life Stories&quot; (Random House), a collection of personal essays. &quot;Learning to Drive&quot; is a departure from her political commentary, covering a range of topics from webstalking a cheating boyfriend to what she learned about her parents using the Freedom of Information Act.

&quot;Learning to Drive&quot; was adapted by screenwriter Sarah Kernochan and director Isabel Coixet into the 2014 film &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;, which stars Patricia Clarkson.

===Poetry===
The first book Pollitt published was a collection of poetry called&quot; Antarctic Traveler&quot; (Knopf, 1982), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award (1983).

Her second volume of poetry, &quot;The Mind-Body Problem&quot;, was published in 2009 and excerpted at Granta.

===&quot;Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights&quot;===

Politt has said that &quot;Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights&quot; (2014), was intended as a response to the &quot;feeling among many pro-choice people that we need to be more assertive, less defensive&quot;. While the topic is always in debate, Pollitt posits that it needs to be discussed in a way that recognizes abortion as an integral component of women&#x27;s reproductive lives. Her argument is built upon the notion that abortion is a &quot;positive social good&quot; and &quot;an essential option for women&quot;. Pollitt says abortion needs to be looked at as &quot;back into the lives and bodies of women, but also in the lives of men, and families, and the children those women already have or will have&quot;. She argues that the issue brings about how we discuss menstrual cycles with young girls and the number of resources we have available for families, both single parent and two-parent. Further the decision should not be looked at as the action of a woman thinking independently because abortion requires the &quot;cooperation of many people beyond the woman herself&quot;. She said in October 2014 that Jewish tradition &quot;does not have the concept of the personhood of the fetus (much less the embryo or fertilized egg). In Jewish law, you become a person when you draw your first breath.&quot;

A group of feminist scholars and activists analyzed &quot;Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights&quot; for &quot;Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism,&quot; an initiative of the feminist journal &quot;Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society&quot;. The commentaries include a response by Pollitt.

==Personal life==
On June 6, 1987, she married Randy Cohen, author of the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; column &quot;The Ethicist.&quot; They later divorced. They have a daughter. On April 29, 2006, Pollitt married the political theorist Steven Lukes. They live in Manhattan.

<text>The Columbus Museum of Art (CMA) is an art museum in downtown Columbus, Ohio. Formed in 1878 as the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts (its name until 1978), it was the first art museum to register its charter with the state of Ohio. The museum collects and exhibits American and European modern and contemporary art, folk art, glass art, and photography. The museum has been led by Executive Director Brooke Minto since 2023.

==History==

The CMA was founded in 1878 as the Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts. Beginning in 1919, it was housed in the Francis C. Sessions house, a founder of Columbus Art School (later known as Columbus College of Art and Design (CCAD). Sessions deeded the mansion and property to the art museum, which operated there until 1923. The house was demolished, with the current museum built on its site. The museum&#x27;s Beaton Hall (administrative offices) includes elements from the entranceway of the Sessions house.

The current building was built on the same site from 1929 to 1931, opening on January 22, 1931. In 1974, a visually unobtrusive structure was added to the rear of the building. The museum building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 19, 1992, under its original name.

The Columbus Museum of Art began a massive reconstruction and expansion in 2007. The first new space opened on January 1, 2011, after 13 months of construction. The space, called the Center for Creativity, is an space that includes galleries, gathering areas, and places for workshops that allow visitors to engage in hands-on activities. On October 25, 2015, the new Margaret M. Walter wing opened to the public, adding 50,000 square feet of addition and 40,000 square feet of major renovation to the Museum. The Margaret M. Walter Wing was designed by Michael Bongiorno of the Columbus-based architecture firm DesignGroup. The museum concurrently revealed a new brand identity led by the Columbus, Ohio-based branding agency Blackletter.

In September 2018, the Pizzuti Collection, a museum in the Short North, was donated to the CMA, along with part of its collection. The museum opened as a part of the Columbus Museum of Art that year. The museum and its Pizzuti Collection branch temporarily closed beginning in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Columbus Museum of Art is part of the Monuments Men and Women Museum Network, launched in 2021 by the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art.

==Ross Building layout and architecture==
The 1931 museum building, today known as the Elizabeth M. and Richard M. Ross Building, was designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style by Columbus architects Richards, McCarty and Bulford. It has a concrete foundation, walls of limestone and concrete, and a truncated copper hipped roof. The building is horizontal, two stories high, and has a central structure advanced several feet in front of its two wings. The wings feature large limestone friezes, together known as &quot;The Frederick W. Schumacher Frieze&quot; or &quot;Masters of Art&quot;. The work, by Robert Ingersoll Aitken and named after Frederick W. Schumacher, depicts 68 artists from 490 B.C. to 1925 A.D.

The original main entryway consists of three arched portals to the interior. The facade here includes decorative moldings, keystones, bulls-eye medallions, and stone quoins. A frieze hung above the arches, with the name &quot;Columbus Gallery of Fine Arts&quot;. A set of sixteen limestone steps leads to the sidewalk, flanked by two Italian-style lamp posts.

The Center for Creativity, on the first floor of the museum, includes a Creativity Lounge, The Studio, The Wonder Room, the Big Idea Gallery, and an Open Gallery.

The term dates from the early 20th century and is used almost exclusively to characterize certain marriages of public celebrities in the first half of the 20th century, primarily before World War II, when public attitudes made it impossible for a person acknowledging homosexuality to pursue a public career, notably in the Hollywood film industry. One of the earliest uses of the phrase appeared in the British press in 1895, at a time when the color of lavender was associated with homosexuality.

==In the Anglosphere==
With the inclusion of morality clauses in the contracts of Hollywood actors in the 1920s, some closeted stars contracted marriages of convenience to protect their public reputations and preserve their careers. A noteworthy exception that demonstrated the precarious position of the public homosexual man was that of William Haines, who brought his career to a sudden end at the age of 35. He refused to end his relationship with his male partner, Jimmy Shields, and enter into a marriage at the direction of his studio employer, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Some companies punished actors for defying these clauses by not paying them. Universal Film Company justified their actions by labeling the actor&#x27;s behavior as unacceptable; this included having attractions that were not heterosexual. These clauses placed actors in a difficult situation as they put their livelihoods on the line and essentially pressured them into lavender marriages. Lavender marriages were also a way to preserve the public&#x27;s image of a celebrity, especially if these celebrities were famous for their looks or sex appeal. The end of the 20th century brought about a change for the LGBTQ+ community, particularly after the 1969 Stonewall riots. Because of this, lavender marriages between celebrities became less common.
The term lavender marriage has been used to characterize the following couples/individuals:

* The English broadcaster and journalist Nancy Spain considered entering a lavender marriage to disguise her relationship with Joan Werner Laurie, a magazine and book editor.
* Actor Rock Hudson, troubled by rumors that &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine was planning to expose his homosexuality, married Phyllis Gates, a young woman employed by his agent, in 1955. Gates insisted until the time of her death that she had had no idea the marriage was anything other than legitimate.
* American theater actress and producer Katharine Cornell married stage director Guthrie McClintic in 1921. She appeared only in productions he directed, and they lived together in their Manhattan townhouse until his death in 1961.
* Swedish Hollywood actor Nils Asther and vaudeville entertainer Vivian Duncan had a brief marriage of convenience that resulted in one child; Asther was a well known homosexual man who had a relationship with actor/stuntman Kenneth DuMain.
Although lavender marriages are typically associated with LGBTQ+ celebrities, people of all backgrounds have used them for protection and convenience. These individuals have found solace on websites where they can express their distress about their marriages of convenience, but not many have talked about their experience outside of the Internet, apart from an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2019, asking individuals to share their reasons for marrying for convenience. In November 2017, an article was published by the BBC about marriages of convenience in Asian LGBTQ+ communities in the UK.

The BBC article and its participants refer to a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot; rather than a lavender marriage, but they are still referring to a marriage that hides one partner&#x27;s sexuality or that of both. Individuals reported that family expectations and keeping up an image were several reasons why they had a marriage of convenience. Awemir Iqbal, a gay man originally from Pakistan and residing in West Yorkshire, stated that he understood why people had a marriage of convenience to satisfy their family&#x27;s wishes. A fear of tarnishing the family name, or being disowned if they were to express their sexuality by pursuing same-sex relationships, leads some to enter into a marriage of convenience. Support for LGBTQ+ individuals comes from &quot;Karma Nirvana&quot;, a group to help individuals escaping forced marriages. Karma Nirvana&#x27;s founder, Jasvinder Sanghera, says there are probably more marriages of convenience than are reported. Websites such as Mocmatch, Saathinight, and Al-Jannah are places where individuals can find partners to partake in a marriage of convenience.

== In the Sinosphere ==

Lavender marriages are known as &quot;Xinghun&quot; (nominal marriage) with the non-homosexual partner in the marriage being called &quot;Tongqi&quot; or &quot;Tongfu&quot; in China, where same-sex marriages or the LGBTQ+ community are not usually accepted. During the Chinese New Year, people travel home to celebrate with their families, but young people also have to worry about pressures surrounding marriage (&quot;Cui Hun&quot;) and having children. For gay Chinese men and women, societal pressure to have a heterosexual relationship can be so profound that they often turn to lavender marriages or &quot;cooperative [marriages]&quot;. Some gay men marry lesbians to undertake societal and parental expectations and ease some pressure. Many couples report that the lavender marriages do more harm than good if individuals deny themselves the expression of their sexuality outside of the marriage.

However, smaller LGBTQ+ communities have gained enough momentum for an app to have been developed specifically focused on providing lavender marriages for LGBTQ+ individuals. The app, called &quot;Queers&quot;, has been discontinued, but it made such an impact in the LGBTQ+ community that former members have asked Queers founder, Liao Zhuoying, for a partner of the opposite sex they can take home to prevent nagging from family members.

<text>Michael Alig (April 29, 1966 – December 24, 2020) was an American club promoter who was convicted of felony manslaughter. He was one of the ringleaders of the Club Kids, a group of young New York City clubgoers who became a cultural phenomenon in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In March 1996, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs, killed fellow Club Kid Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez in a confrontation over a drug debt. In October 1997, Alig pled guilty to first-degree manslaughter. Both men were sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison. Riggs was released on parole in 2010. Alig was released on May 5, 2014.

On Christmas Eve, 2020, shortly before midnight, Alig died at his Washington Heights home from an accidental drug overdose at the age of 54.

== Early years ==
Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Michael Alig was the second of two sons born to John and Elke Alig. His mother, a native of Bremerhaven, Germany, moved to the United States after marrying his father, a computer programmer. The couple divorced when Alig was four years old.

Alig attended Grissom Middle School and Penn High School, where he was a straight-A student and graduated in the top 8% of his class. During his teenage years, Alig reported that he was often bullied because of his homosexuality. Seeking a less conservative social environment after graduating in 1984, he attended Fordham University in New York City. He studied architecture there before transferring to the Fashion Institute of Technology. There, he met the boyfriend of artist Keith Haring, who introduced Alig to New York City nightlife. Alig soon dropped out of school and began working at Danceteria as a bus boy.

== Underground club scene ==

===Alig&#x27;s Club Kids===
While working at Danceteria, Alig studied the nightclub business and soon became a party promoter. His ability to stage memorable parties helped him rise in New York&#x27;s party scene. During this time, Alig and other regular clubgoers began creating flamboyant personas, and later became known as &quot;Club Kids&quot;. The Club Kids wore outrageous costumes that former Club Kid and celebutante James St. James later described as &quot;part drag, part clown, part infantilism&quot;. They were also known for their frequent use of ketamine (known as Special K), Ecstasy, Rohypnol, heroin, and cocaine. Alig&#x27;s Club Kids included (among others): &quot;Astro Erle&quot;, &quot;Ernie Glam&quot;, &quot;Gitsie&quot;, &quot;Jennytalia&quot;, &quot;Superstar DJ Keoki&quot;, Amanda Lepore, Charlie &quot;Dash&quot; Prestano, Joshua Davis, &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, Robert &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs, RuPaul, and &quot;Walt Paper&quot;. The Club Kids&#x27; outrageousness became a source of interest for the media, and articles about them appeared in such media outlets as &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, and &quot;TIME&quot;. They also appeared on &quot;Donahue&quot;, &quot;Geraldo&quot;, and &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;.

In 1988, Alig was hired by the owner of The Limelight, Peter Gatien. Alig&#x27;s parties at The Limelight were such a hit that he began organizing parties for Gatien&#x27;s other clubs: Club USA, the Palladium, and Tunnel. Alig&#x27;s notorious &quot;Outlaw Parties&quot;, which were thrown in various unconventional places including a McDonalds, a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, abandoned houses, and a subway, helped to revitalize the downtown New York City club scene which &quot;Village Voice&quot; columnist Michael Musto declared had atrophied after artist Andy Warhol died in 1987.

Alig&#x27;s parties also became notorious due in part to his own &quot;bad behavior&quot;. Alig would throw $100 bills on crowded dance floors just to watch people scramble for them. In other instances, he would urinate on clubgoers or urinate in their drinks, and would engage in stage falls wherein he knocked others to the ground.

As Alig&#x27;s popularity in the club scene grew, so did his drug use. He was arrested several times for drug offenses and entered rehab, but continued to use drugs. In 1995, his boss, Gatien, sent Alig to rehab once again. Alig later claimed that after he completed his stint and was released, Gatien fired him.

Some of Alig&#x27;s behavior could be explained by a personality disorder. He reported being diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder, which is characterized by high levels of attention-seeking behavior, stating: &quot;The doctor said I was the most extreme case he&#x27;d ever seen. Everything has to be completely over the top and exaggerated. It worked well for my job – I was a promoter.&quot;

==Killing of Angel Melendez==

Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez was a regular on the New York City club scene and worked at The Limelight, among other clubs (some not owned by Gatien, e.g., Webster Hall), where he sold drugs on the premises. After The Limelight was closed by federal agents and an investigation found that Gatien was allowing drugs to be sold there, Melendez was fired. Shortly thereafter, he moved into Alig&#x27;s Riverbank West apartment. On the night of March 17, 1996, Alig and his roommate, Robert D. &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs, killed Melendez after an argument in Alig&#x27;s apartment over many things, including a long-standing drug debt. Alig claimed many times that he was so high on drugs that his memory of the events was unclear.

After Melendez&#x27;s death, Alig and Riggs did not know what to do with the body. They initially left it in the bathtub, which they filled with ice. After a few days, the body began to decompose and became malodorous. After discussing what to do with Melendez&#x27;s body and who should do it, Riggs went to Macy&#x27;s to buy knives and a box. In exchange for 10 bags of heroin, Alig agreed to dismember Melendez&#x27;s body. He cut his legs off and put them each in a separate garbage bag, then into separate duffel bags and threw them into the Hudson River. The rest of the body was put into a large box Riggs found in the basement of their apartment. Afterwards, he and Riggs threw the box into the Hudson River.

In the weeks following Melendez&#x27;s disappearance, Alig allegedly told &quot;anyone who would listen&quot; that he and Riggs had killed him. Most people did not believe Alig and thought his &quot;confession&quot; was a ploy to get attention.
On April 23, 1996, Michael Musto reported rumors of Alig&#x27;s involvement in Melendez&#x27;s death via a blind item in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; column. Although no names were used, Musto&#x27;s reports included the details of murder. Musto had previously reported on Alig&#x27;s firing from The Limelight and noted the buzz about a missing club person. On April 27, 1996, the &quot;New York Post&quot;″s &quot;Page Six&quot; column ran a lead item about the murder mystery, citing Musto&#x27;s reporting as well as a &quot;New York&quot; magazine piece quoting an evasive Alig. Over the coming weeks, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; continued to report and make accusations about Melendez&#x27;s murder.

Through September 1996, the police still had not questioned Alig about the murder; they were focused on his former boss and onetime business partner, Peter Gatien, wanting Alig to testify against him. Since several months had passed, many people believed Alig would get away with murdering Melendez, until children playing in the water pulled a box containing a legless torso from the waters of Oakwood Beach at Miller Field, in New Dorp, Staten Island. James St. James recounted how Melendez&#x27;s brother was baffled by what he regarded as callous indifference by the police and by the scenesters Melendez had considered friends.

In November 1996, the coroner reported the body had been identified as Melendez. Alig fled New York, but was located by police in a motel room rented by his drug dealer boyfriend, Brian, in Toms River, New Jersey. Alig was arrested as was Riggs. Shortly after his arrest, Riggs confessed to police:

According to Riggs, he hit Melendez a total of three times on the head with the hammer. Then Alig grabbed a pillow and tried to smother him. While Melendez was unconscious, Riggs went to the other room; when he returned, he noticed a broken syringe on the floor. Riggs claimed that Alig was pouring &quot;some cleaner or chemical&quot; into Melendez&#x27; mouth, then duct-taped it with the help of Riggs. Alig disputed these claims, however, and cited the &quot;Drano in the hypodermic needle&quot; as one of the key false dramatizations in &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; and &quot;Party Monster&quot;.

Alig claimed he killed Melendez in self-defense and helped to dispose of the body in a panic. Prosecutors were hesitant to charge Alig with first-degree murder, as they still hoped he would testify against his former boss, Peter Gatien, who had been arrested for allowing drugs to be sold in his nightclubs. They eventually offered both Alig and Riggs a plea deal: a sentence of 10 to 20 years if they accepted the lesser charge of manslaughter. On October 1, 1997, both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 10 to 20 years.

While in prison, Alig told Musto, &quot;I know why I blabbed. I must have wanted to stop me. I was spinning out of control. It&#x27;s like the old saying &#x27;What do you have to do to get attention around here – kill somebody?&#x27;&quot;

== Prison ==
While incarcerated in the New York State prison system, Alig was transferred from prison to prison; he also spent time in the psychiatric ward at Rikers Island. In 2000, at Southport Correctional Facility, he was placed in solitary confinement after he was caught using heroin. He remained in solitary for another two-and-a-half years after a drug test showed that he was still using drugs.

In August 2004, James St. James began a blog entitled &quot;Phone Calls From a Felon&quot;. The blog contained transcripts of phone conversations between Alig and St. James about Alig&#x27;s experiences in prison. After six weeks, Alig put a stop to the phone calls claiming, &quot;People think I&#x27;m having a grand old time. Or that I&#x27;m trying to exploit my situation.&quot; He was moved to Elmira Correctional Facility that year.
Alig became eligible for parole in 2006. His first parole request, in November 2006, was denied, reportedly after parole officers watched the film &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003), a fictionalized account of Alig&#x27;s life, starring Macaulay Culkin. He was again denied parole in July 2008 after failing several drug tests. In an interview with his former fellow prisoner, Daniel Genis, Alig said that his time spent reading while in solitary inspired him to write his memoirs, which he titled &quot;Aligula&quot;, and he particularly identified with the character Raskolnikov from Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. In March 2009, Alig said he finally decided to stop using drugs and that he had been sober since then.

== Post-prison ==
Alig was paroled on May 5, 2014. Per the conditions of his parole, Alig returned to New York City. He was required to abide by an 8:00p.m. curfew and undergo drug and anger management counseling, and job readiness training. In the months following his release, Alig granted numerous interviews in which he expressed a desire to star in his own reality show and stage an exhibition of his artwork.

=== Art ===
In May 2015, a selection of Alig&#x27;s paintings went on display at the SELECT Fair in New York.
On June 25, 2015, Alig had his first and only art show event held in three separate art galleries in New York City in the LES area. In the New York Post article &quot;Party Monster: Painting in Prison Kept Me from Killing Myself&quot;, it featured the upcoming June 25, 2015 art event, an interview of Michael Alig as a painter and photos his paintings such as Zombie Babies, Club Kids and the Pfizer series - Orange Butterflies Pfizer painting.

The art event was filmed by World of Wonder (WOW) for the &quot;Party Monster 2&quot; movie. James St James, DJ Keoki, JennyTalia, film director Eric Spade Rivas, Hollywood musician/movie actress Ingrid LaLa, NYC musician/painter Joseph Arthur, NYC nightlife legend Steve Lewis, and many others attended Michael Alig&#x27;s June 25, 2015 art event. 

=== Nightlife and film career ===
DJ Keoki started to DJ at a weekly Monday night party called Outrage! in the New York City LES area. Later DJ Keoki got Alig involved with Outrage!. Michael Alig enlisted his mentor and executive manager from Hollywood, Ingrid LaLa, to create a master contact list, do PR and send MailChimp emails for the Outrage! parties. Outrage! became a success that ran the venue every Monday night with DJ Keoki doing DJ sets and Alig bringing in the old and new generation of Club Kids.

In January 2017, Alig convinced NYC nightlife personality/musician Jason Chaos to curate and work Outrage! Each week Outrage! had a party with a theme. With Jason Chaos, Alig, Ingrid LaLa and others working as a team, Outrage! became a successful party and Alig was working in nightlife promotions again.

Alig starred in four Eric Spade Rivas films : Vamp Bikers, Vamp Bikers Dos, Vamp Bikers 3 and Duke of New York.

On February 2, 2017, Alig was arrested for trespassing and smoking crystal meth in Joyce Kilmer Park in Concourse, outside the Bronx Supreme Court, at approximately 1:30 a.m. He was detained because the park closes after dusk. The complaint alleges that &quot;police found a bag of crystal meth and a pipe with residue from the drug in his jacket pocket&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Alig was arraigned on drug possession and trespass charges, and pleaded guilty to trespass in exchange for a conditional discharge.
After working the Outrage! events, Alig continued to promote and host parties in New York City. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, Michael Alig and Jason Chaos hosted Zoom party events. Due to the popularity of these events during the lockdown, NYC police investigated believing there was a real in person event when it was actually a virtual party. Alig hosted these virtual parties until his death.

=== Death ===
On December 24, 2020, shortly before midnight, Alig was found unconscious by his ex-boyfriend at their Washington Heights, Manhattan, home. He was using heroin before he fell ill and was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 54 years old. The following day, Christmas, Alig&#x27;s mother confirmed his cause of death as an accidental heroin overdose. The Office of the Chief Medical examiner in New York City verified in May 2021 that Alig died from acute intoxication from the drugs fentanyl, acetylfentanyl, heroin and methamphetamine.

<text>Rear Admiral Benjamin Thurman Hacker (1935–2003) was a U.S. Naval officer, who became the first Naval Flight Officer (NFO) to achieve Flag rank.

==Early life==
Hacker was born September 19, 1935, in Washington, D.C. His father, C. Leroy Hacker, was an author, Baptist pastor and a chaplain in the U.S. Army. His mother, Alzeda (Crockett) Hacker, was an accomplished musician. Of their three children, Benjamin was the eldest.

Benjamin attended Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, graduating in 1957 with a B.A. Degree in Science. He married his wife, Jeanne, in 1958.

==Naval service==
After completing the Navy&#x27;s Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, in September 1958, Hacker was commissioned Ensign and subsequently received the designation of Naval Aviation Observer (NAO). Hacker gained experience as a Navigator and Tactical Coordinator in SP-2H &quot;Neptune&quot; and P-3C &quot;Orion&quot; aircraft through numerous operational assignments in the far reaches of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Mediterranean Sea.

He took command of the United States Naval Facility, Barbados, West Indies on July 2, 1968. In 1972, he established the Naval ROTC Unit at Florida A &amp; M University, in Tallahassee, Florida, and served as the first Commanding Officer and Professor of Naval Science of this unit. In 1974 he became Commanding Officer of Patrol Squadron 24 (VP-24), a P-3C &quot;Orion&quot; Squadron stationed in Jacksonville, Florida, and was promoted to captain following his squadron command tour.

In June 1978, he completed studies in National Security Policy at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and earned a Masters of Science Degree in Administration from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In August 1978, he was assigned as Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station, Brunswick, Maine.
In 1980, then-Captain Hacker was selected for promotion to rear admiral and assumed duties as Commander, U.S. Military Enlistment Processing Command with headquarters in Fort Sheridan, Illinois. In 1982, he became Commander Fleet Air Mediterranean; Commander Maritime Surveillance and Reconnaissance Forces, U.S. Sixth Fleet; and Commander Maritime Air Forces Mediterranean simultaneously with headquarters in Naples, Italy. In 1986, he was assigned as Commander, Naval Training Center, San Diego. During this assignment he was also assigned Commander, Naval Base San Diego. He held both commands simultaneously for several months. In 1988, at the completion of his assignment as Commander, Naval Base San Diego, Rear Admiral Hacker retired from the U.S. Navy.

Rear Admiral Hacker was the first Naval Flight Officer (NFO) to be selected for Flag rank in the United States Navy. He held ten commands over the course of his 30-year military career. Included among Rear Admiral Hacker&#x27;s personal decorations are the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with three Gold Stars, and the Meritorious Service Medal.

On November 3, 2005, the &quot;Commander, Task Force 67&quot; headquarters building located in Sigonella, Sicily was dedicated in his honor.

==Civilian==
After retiring from the Navy, Rear Admiral Hacker worked at financial-services firm USAA as assistant vice president for policy service, at the organization&#x27;s western regional office in Sacramento.

In the early 1990s, at the request of then-Governor Pete Wilson, Hacker served for two years as director of the California Department of Veterans Affairs and then rejoined USAA as regional vice president and general manager of its western region. He moved to San Antonio in his next post in December 1995.

Hacker also held posts as Regional Senior Vice President/General Manager in the company&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Region headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia. Rear Admiral Hacker retired from USAA in 1998 but continued to serve on various local and national boards.

On December 28, 2003, Rear Admiral Hacker died from complications relating to chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease which he battled for 12 years. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Epping is a suburb of Sydney, in the Australian state of New South Wales, north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. Epping is in the Northern Sydney region.
The suburb is the most north-eastern area of the City of Parramatta. North Epping is a separate suburb to the north and under a different council, Hornsby Shire.

==History==
The Wallumettagal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River. In 1792, Governor Arthur Phillip began the granting of parcels of lands to marines, and the area was referred to on Phillip&#x27;s maps as the Field of Mars, Mars being the Roman god of war. It contained the area of what is now Epping, along with the surrounding suburbs of Ryde and Marsfield.

Epping railway station was opened on 17 September 1886, originally named &quot;Field of Mars&quot;, and quickly renamed to &quot;Carlingford&quot; on 5 April 1887. The Post Office was opened on 16 October 1889, originally named &quot;East Carlingford&quot;.
In 1899 the suburb name of Epping was adopted following the suggestion by a local landowner William Midson (1849–1924), after a town near Epping Forest in Essex, where his father was born. At this time, the names of the post office and the railway station were both changed to Epping. The land from the Field of Mars was broken up into farms and orchards, and after World War II it started to convert to residential use. Areas which had previously been reserved as part of the green belt scheme became available in 1948.

The post-war period saw suburban development as Sydney’s population grew, with many people moving to the outer suburbs. The extension of the railway line from Sydney to Epping in the 1950s played a key role in connecting the suburb to the city, encouraging more people to settle there. It evolved into a more suburbanised, diverse community. The area became increasingly attractive to professionals due to its convenient public transport links, proximity to employment centres and schools.

The Seven Network had its headquarters and television production studios in Epping until 2009. The site is now occupied by residential apartments.

Until 2016, parts of Epping were under three different councils: Hornsby Shire, City of Ryde and City of Parramatta. A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that all of Epping be amalgamated into the City of Parramatta, and this became effective on 12 May 2016.

On 26 May 2019, a new metro station along the North West Rail Link was opened in Epping.

==Commercial area==

Lands around Epping Railway Station are zoned for commercial use. There are businesses including newsagencies, pharmacies, Asian grocers and restaurants. To the west of the station, there is a Coles supermarket, a RSL Club and a pub (the Epping Hotel) on Rawson Street.

===Redevelopment as &quot;Urban Renewal Area&quot;===
A major re-development of the Epping Town Centre is planned as part of the NSW government&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Urban Renewal Area&quot; programme (originally called the &quot;Urban Activation Precincts&quot;&quot; programme). The changes to zoning for this programme cover 54 hectares, including provision for building heights of 8 to 22 storeys (although later proposals are up to 36 stories) for mixed commercial and residential use within a 400-metre radius of the railway station, and about 3,750 additional homes within 800 metres of it. These zoning changes were finalized and approved in March 2014, although residents have expressed concerns about issues including traffic management, lack of parking, storm water drainage and access to schools.

The first major project under this programme was scheduled to be Grocon&#x27;s amalgamation of four lots at 30-42 Oxford Street, acquired in September 2015 for a cost of $56 million. Plans for a 16-storey development of more than 250 apartments for a total value of more than $300 million were lodged with the council. However, in early 2016 they sold the blocks. In late 2019, the &quot;Oxford Central&quot; development of 251 or 252 apartments, car parking and retail was completed on the site by developer Greaton and construction company Ceerose.

==Transport==

Epping railway station is a junction station on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network, the Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line of the NSW TrainLink network, and the rapid transit Sydney Metro Northwest since its opening on 26 May 2019.

Bus services are operated by Busways and CDC NSW. The M2 Hills Motorway runs along the northern border to the Sydney central business district. Epping Road is a major arterial road in the area that runs east from the railway station to the Pacific Highway.

==Community facilities==

The council and other organisations provide a number of community facilities. These include:
* Epping Aquatic and Leisure Centre (also known as Dence Park Aquatic Centre) off 26 Stanley Road, features a heated outdoor 50-metre pool, a warmer heated &quot;learn to swim&quot; pool, a covered toddlers&#x27; play pool, a gymnasium and a kiosk/coffee shop. A range of classes and training is held at the centre.
* Epping Branch Library, at 1 Chambers Court (off Pembroke Street) is a branch of City of Parramatta Library and formerly a branch of Hornsby Shire Library. Membership is free and provides access to a wide range of services.
* West Epping Community Centre is on the corner of Dent and Downing Streets, beside West Epping Park and Oval. Capacity: 100 people. Attached to the Community Centre is the West Epping Community Preschool which shares the two enclosed playgrounds.
* Epping Community Centre at 9 Oxford Street, near the railway station. Capacity: 300 people (all areas combined). Formerly known as the Epping School of Arts, the community centre was designed by Lord Livingstone Ramsay, an architect who was President of Hornsby Shire from 1909 until 1913. It was built in three stages between 1906 and 1916, and officially opened in 1909. The building has a large auditorium with a stage, two meeting rooms, a commercial standard kitchen, and a second smaller hall downstairs.
* Epping Leisure and Learning Centre at 1 Chambers Court (off Pembroke Street), downstairs from the Epping Branch Library. Capacity: 100 people.
* Epping Creative Centre at 26 Stanley Road, beside the entrance to Dence Park Aquatic Centre. Capacity: 100 people. This centre has an emphasis on creative and educational leisure activities. Epping Creative Centre was opened in September 1989, originally in the back rooms of the Dence Park building, then in 1999 the council granted full use of the premises.
* Epping YMCA at 15 Ward Street caters for the diverse ages, interests and abilities of the surrounding community. In 2012, a million-dollar redevelopment saw the family centre substantially modernised. Facilities include a health club, group fitness studio, one-court indoor stadium, community program room, international standard gymnastics arena, and tennis courts.

Some schools and churches also have halls and other facilities that can be made available for community uses.

<text>Great Goddess is the concept of an almighty goddess or mother goddess, or a matriarchal religion. Apart from various specific figures called this from various cultures, the Great Goddess hypothesis, is a postulated fertility goddess supposed to have been worshipped in the Neolithic era across most of Eurasia at least. Scholarly belief in this hypothesis has reduced in recent decades, though theological belief in a Great Goddess is common in the Goddess movement.

Specific examples include:

*Great Goddess, also known as the Triple Goddess or Diana, an important feminine deity of the Neopagan religion of Wicca
*Great Goddess, referring to the ancient Anatolian goddess Cybele; also associated with Rhea (mother of the gods) and Gaia (mother of the Titans)
*Great Goddess, anglicized form of the Roman &quot;Magna Dea&quot;
*Great Goddess, anglicized form of the Sanskrit Mahadevi, the Shakti sum of all goddesses
*Magu (deity), a deity in Chinese and Korean myth
*Great Goddess of Teotihuacan, an ancient Mesoamerican deity

<text>In quantum information theory, a quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation, similar to classical circuits, in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, measurements, initializations of qubits to known values, and possibly other actions. The minimum set of actions that a circuit needs to be able to perform on the qubits to enable quantum computation is known as DiVincenzo&#x27;s criteria.

Circuits are written such that the horizontal axis is time, starting at the left hand side and ending at the right. Horizontal lines are qubits, doubled lines represent classical bits. The items that are connected by these lines are operations performed on the qubits, such as measurements or gates. These lines define the sequence of events, and are usually not physical cables.

The graphical depiction of quantum circuit elements is described using a variant of the Penrose graphical notation. Richard Feynman used an early version of the quantum circuit notation in 1986.

== Reversible classical logic gates ==
Most elementary logic gates of a classical computer are not reversible. Thus, for instance, for an AND gate one cannot always recover the two input bits from the output bit; for example, if the output bit is 0, we cannot tell from this whether the input bits are 01 or 10 or 00.

However, reversible gates in classical computers are easily constructed for bit strings of any length; moreover, these are actually of practical interest, since irreversible gates must always increase physical entropy. A reversible gate is a reversible function on &quot;n&quot;-bit data that returns &quot;n&quot;-bit data, where an &quot;n&quot;-bit data is a string of bits &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2, ...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of length &quot;n&quot;. The set of &quot;n&quot;-bit data is the space {0,1}&quot;n&quot;, which consists of 2&quot;n&quot; strings of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s.

More precisely: an &quot;n&quot;-bit reversible gate is a bijective mapping &quot;f&quot; from the set {0,1}&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot;-bit data onto itself.
An example of such a reversible gate &quot;f&quot; is a mapping that applies a fixed permutation to its inputs.
For reasons of practical engineering, one typically studies gates only for small values of &quot;n&quot;, e.g. &quot;n&quot;=1, &quot;n&quot;=2 or &quot;n&quot;=3. These gates can be easily described by tables.

== Quantum logic gates ==
The quantum logic gates are reversible unitary transformations on at least one qubit. Multiple qubits taken together are referred to as quantum registers. To define quantum gates, we first need to specify the quantum replacement of an &quot;n&quot;-bit datum. The &quot;quantized version&quot; of classical &quot;n&quot;-bit space {0,1}&quot;n&quot; is the Hilbert space

:formula_1

This is by definition the space of complex-valued functions on {0,1}&quot;n&quot; and is naturally an inner product space. formula_2 means the function is a square-integrable function. This space can also be regarded as consisting of linear combinations, or superpositions, of classical bit strings. Note that &quot;H&quot;QB(&quot;n&quot;) is a vector space over the complex numbers of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;. The elements of this vector space are the possible state-vectors of &quot;n&quot;-qubit quantum registers.

Using Dirac ket notation, if &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2, ...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a classical bit string, then 
:formula_3
is a special &quot;n&quot;-qubit register corresponding to the function which maps this classical bit string to 1 and maps all other bit strings to 0; these 2&quot;n&quot; special &quot;n&quot;-qubit registers are called &quot;computational basis states&quot;. All &quot;n&quot;-qubit registers are complex linear combinations of these computational basis states.

Quantum logic gates, in contrast to classical logic gates, are always reversible. One requires a special kind of reversible function, namely a unitary mapping, that is, a linear transformation of a complex inner product space that preserves the Hermitian inner product. An &quot;n&quot;-qubit (reversible) quantum gate is a unitary mapping &quot;U&quot; from the space &quot;H&quot;QB(&quot;n&quot;) of &quot;n&quot;-qubit registers onto itself.

Typically, we are only interested in gates for small values of &quot;n&quot;.

A reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit classical logic gate gives rise to a reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit quantum gate as follows: to each reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit logic gate &quot;f&quot; corresponds a quantum gate &quot;W&quot;&quot;f&quot; defined as follows:
:formula_4
Note that &quot;W&quot;&quot;f&quot; permutes the computational basis states.

Of particular importance is the controlled NOT gate (also called CNOT gate) &quot;W&quot;CNOT defined on a quantized 2 qubit. Other examples of quantum logic gates derived from classical ones are the Toffoli gate and the Fredkin gate.

However, the Hilbert-space structure of the qubits permits many quantum gates that are not induced by classical ones. For example, a relative phase shift is a 1 qubit gate given by multiplication by the phase shift operator:
:formula_5
so 
:formula_6

== Reversible logic circuits ==
Again, we consider first &quot;reversible&quot; classical computation. Conceptually, there is no difference between a reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit circuit and a reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit logic gate: either one is just an invertible function on the space of &quot;n&quot; bit data. However, as mentioned in the previous section, for engineering reasons we would like to have a small number of simple reversible gates, that can be put together to assemble any reversible circuit.

To explain this assembly process, suppose we have a reversible &quot;n&quot;-bit gate &quot;f&quot; and a reversible &quot;m&quot;-bit gate &quot;g&quot;. Putting them together means producing a new circuit by connecting some set of &quot;k&quot; outputs of &quot;f&quot; to some set of &quot;k&quot; inputs of &quot;g&quot; as in the figure below. In that figure, &quot;n&quot;=5, &quot;k&quot;=3 and &quot;m&quot;=7. The resulting circuit is also reversible and operates on &quot;n&quot;+&quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot; bits.

We will refer to this scheme as a &quot;classical assemblage&quot; (This concept corresponds to a technical definition in Kitaev&#x27;s pioneering paper cited below). In composing these reversible machines, it is important to ensure that the intermediate machines are also reversible. This condition assures that &quot;intermediate&quot; &quot;garbage&quot; is not created (the net physical effect would be to increase entropy, which is one of the motivations for going through this exercise).

Note that each horizontal line on the above picture represents either 0 or 1, not these probabilities. Since quantum computations are reversible, at each &#x27;step&#x27; the number of lines must be the same number of input lines. Also, each input combination must be mapped to a single combination at each &#x27;step&#x27;. This means that each intermediate combination in a quantum circuit is a bijective function of the input.

Now it is possible to show that the Toffoli gate is a universal gate. This means that given any reversible classical &quot;n&quot;-bit circuit &quot;h&quot;, we can construct a classical assemblage of Toffoli gates in the above manner to produce an (&quot;n&quot;+&quot;m&quot;)-bit circuit &quot;f&quot; such that
:formula_7
where there are &quot;m&quot; underbraced zeroed inputs and 
:formula_8.
Notice that the result always has a string of &quot;m&quot; zeros as the ancilla bits. No &quot;rubbish&quot; is ever produced, and so this computation is indeed one that, in a physical sense, generates no entropy. This issue is carefully discussed in Kitaev&#x27;s article.

More generally, any function &quot;f&quot; (bijective or not) can be simulated by a circuit of Toffoli gates. Obviously, if the mapping fails to be injective, at some point in the simulation (for example as the last step) some &quot;garbage&quot; has to be produced.

For quantum circuits a similar composition of qubit gates can be defined. That is, associated to any &quot;classical assemblage&quot; as above, we can produce a reversible quantum circuit when in place of &quot;f&quot; we have an &quot;n&quot;-qubit gate &quot;U&quot; and in place of &quot;g&quot; we have an &quot;m&quot;-qubit gate &quot;W&quot;. See illustration below:

The fact that connecting gates this way gives rise to a unitary mapping on &quot;n&quot;+&quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot; qubit space is easy to check. In a real quantum computer the physical connection between the gates is a major engineering challenge, since it is one of the places where decoherence may occur.

There are also universality theorems for certain sets of well-known gates; such a universality theorem exists, for instance, for the pair consisting of the single qubit phase gate &quot;U&quot;θ mentioned above (for a suitable value of θ), together with the 2-qubit CNOT gate &quot;W&quot;CNOT. However, the universality theorem for the quantum case is somewhat weaker than the one for the classical case; it asserts only that any reversible &quot;n&quot;-qubit circuit can be &quot;approximated&quot; arbitrarily well by circuits assembled from these two elementary gates. Note that there are uncountably many possible single qubit phase gates, one for every possible angle θ, so they cannot all be represented by a finite circuit constructed from {&quot;U&quot;θ, &quot;W&quot;CNOT}.

== Quantum computations ==

So far we have not shown how quantum circuits are used to perform computations. Since many important numerical problems reduce to computing a unitary transformation &quot;U&quot; on a finite-dimensional space (the celebrated discrete Fourier transform 
being a prime example), one might expect that some quantum circuit could be designed to carry out the transformation &quot;U&quot;. In principle, one needs only to prepare an &quot;n&quot; qubit state ψ as an appropriate superposition of computational basis states for the input and measure the output &quot;U&quot;ψ. Unfortunately, there are two problems with this:

* One cannot measure the phase of ψ at any computational basis state so there is no way of reading out the complete answer. This is in the nature of measurement in quantum mechanics.
* There is no way to efficiently prepare the input state ψ.

This does not prevent quantum circuits for the discrete Fourier transform from being used as intermediate steps in other quantum circuits, but the use is more subtle. In fact quantum computations are &quot;probabilistic&quot;.

We now provide a mathematical model for how quantum circuits can simulate
&quot;probabilistic&quot; but classical computations. Consider an &quot;r&quot;-qubit circuit &quot;U&quot; with
register space &quot;H&quot;QB(&quot;r&quot;). &quot;U&quot; is thus a unitary map
:formula_9

In order to associate this circuit to a classical mapping on bitstrings, we specify

* An &quot;input register&quot; &quot;X&quot; = {0,1}&quot;m&quot; of &quot;m&quot; (classical) bits.
* An &quot;output register&quot; &quot;Y&quot; = {0,1}&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot; (classical) bits.

The contents &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; of
the classical input register are used to initialize the qubit
register in some way. Ideally, this would be done with the computational basis
state 
:formula_10
where there are &quot;r&quot;-&quot;m&quot; underbraced zeroed inputs. Nevertheless,
this perfect initialization is completely unrealistic. Let us assume
therefore that the initialization is a mixed state given by some density operator &quot;S&quot; which is near the idealized input in some appropriate metric, e.g.
:formula_11

Similarly, the output register space is related to the qubit register, by a &quot;Y&quot;
valued observable &quot;A&quot;. Note that observables in quantum mechanics are usually defined in
terms of &quot;projection valued measures&quot; on R; if the variable
happens to be discrete, the projection valued measure reduces to a
family {Eλ} indexed on some parameter λ
ranging over a countable set. Similarly, a &quot;Y&quot; valued observable,
can be associated with a family of pairwise orthogonal projections
{E&quot;y&quot;} indexed by elements of &quot;Y&quot;. such that
:formula_12

Given a mixed state &quot;S&quot;, there corresponds a probability measure on &quot;Y&quot;
given by 
:formula_13

The function &quot;F&quot;:&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is computed by a circuit
&quot;U&quot;:&quot;H&quot;QB(&quot;r&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;QB(&quot;r&quot;) to within ε if and only if
for all bitstrings &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;m&quot;
:formula_14

Now 
:formula_15
so that
:formula_16

Theorem. If ε + δ &lt; 1/2, then the probability distribution 
:formula_17
on &quot;Y&quot; can be used to determine &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) with an arbitrarily small probability of error by majority sampling, for a sufficiently large sample size. Specifically, take &quot;k&quot; independent samples from the probability distribution Pr on &quot;Y&quot; and choose a value on which more than half of the samples agree. The probability that the value &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is sampled more than &quot;k&quot;/2 times is at least
:formula_18
where γ = 1/2 - ε - δ.

This follows by applying the Chernoff bound.

==Accelerating Quantum Computing Simulations with FPGAs==
With the advent of quantum computing, there has been a significant surge in both the number of developers and available tools. However, the slow pace of technological advancement and the high maintenance costs associated with quantum computers have limited broader participation in this field. In response, developers have turned to simulators, such as IBM&#x27;s Qiskit, to model quantum behavior without relying solely on real quantum hardware. Nevertheless, simulators, being classical computers, are constrained by computation speed. The fundamental advantage of quantum computers lies in their ability to process qubits, leveraging properties like entanglement and superposition simultaneously. By running quantum simulations on classical computers, the inherent parallelism of quantum computing is taken away. Moreover, as the number of simulated qubits increases, the simulation&#x27;s speed decreases proportionally.

In a quantum circuit, the vectors are used to represent the state of the qubits and different matrices are used to represent the gate that is applied on the qubits. Since linear algebra is a major component of the quantum simulation, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) could be used to accelerate the simulation of quantum computing. FPGA is a kind of hardware that excels at executing operations in parallel, supports pipelining, has on-chip memory resources with low access latency, and offers the flexibility to reconfigure the hardware architecture on-the-fly which make it a well suited tool to handle matrix multiplication. 

The main idea of accelerating quantum computing simulations is to offload some of the heavy computation to special hardware like FPGA in order to speed up the whole simulation process. And the bigger quantum circuits (more qubits and more gates) we simulate, the more speedup we gain from offloading to FPGA compared with software simulations on CPU. The data flow of the simulation is explained below. First, the user inputs all the information of the quantum circuit including initial state and various gates through the user interface. Then, all this information is compressed and sent to the FPGA through some hardware communication protocols like AXI. Then, all the information is stored in the on-chip memory in the FPGA. And the simulation starts when the data is read from the memory and sent to the Matrix multiplication module. After all the calculation is done, the result will be sent back to the memory and to the CPU. 

Suppose we are simulating 5-qubit circuits, then we need to store the vector that holds 32 (2⁵) 16-bit values, each of which represents the square-root probability of a possible existing state. We also need to store the 32x32 matrix that represents the gate. In order to parallel this computation, we can store the 32 rows of the matrix separately and replicate 32 row_vec_mult hardware such that each row can calculate the multiplication in parallel. This will dramatically speed up the simulation with a price of more hardware and memory usage in FPGA. 

It has been discovered that with careful hardware design, it&#x27;s possible to achieve a hardware architecture with O(n) time complexity, where &#x27;n&#x27; denotes the number of qubits. In contrast, the runtime of Numpy approaches O(2^2^n). This finding underscores the feasibility of leveraging FPGAs to accelerate quantum computing simulations.

<text>Marvin John Heemeyer (October 28, 1951 – June 4, 2004) was an American automobile muffler repair shop owner who demolished numerous buildings with a modified bulldozer in Granby, Colorado, in 2004. Heemeyer&#x27;s machine was posthumously nicknamed the Killdozer.

Heemeyer had various grudges against Granby town officials, neighbors of his muffler shop, the local press, and various other citizens of Granby. Over about eighteen months, Heemeyer secretly armored a Komatsu D355A bulldozer with layers of steel and concrete.

On Friday, June 4, 2004, Heemeyer used the bulldozer to demolish the Granby town hall, the house of a former mayor, and several other buildings. He killed himself after the bulldozer became stuck in a hardware store he was destroying. No one else was injured or killed, in part due to timely evacuation orders.

==Background==
Marvin Heemeyer was born on October 28, 1951, on a dairy farm in South Dakota. In 1974, he moved to Colorado because he was stationed at Lowry Air Force Base. In 1989, he moved to Grand Lake, Colorado, about away from Granby. His friends said that he had no relatives in the Granby–Grand Lake area.

John Bauldree, a friend of Heemeyer&#x27;s, said that he was a likable person. Heemeyer&#x27;s brother Ken stated that he &quot;would bend over backwards for anyone.&quot; While many people described Heemeyer as an affable person, local resident Christie Baker claimed that she was told that Heemeyer threatened her husband after he refused to pay for a disputed muffler repair. Baker said her husband later paid Heemeyer $124.

Heemeyer enjoyed taking snowmobile trips with friends. He led a rescue effort on one such trip after a friend became trapped in a small avalanche.

=== Gambling legalization ===
Heemeyer was strongly in favor of gambling legalization and campaigned for the cause on several occasions. At one point, he began disseminating a newspaper of his own on the issue, as he believed the local newspapers were biased against this cause.

In 1994, a measure was proposed that would have legalized gambling in Grand Lake. Heemeyer was an avid supporter of the proposal, and so passionate about the cause that he nearly came to blows with a local reporter who was opposed to the proposal.

==Zoning and sewage disputes==
In 1992, Heemeyer purchased of land for $42,000 () at auction with plans to lease the property to a friend who intended to build an auto repair shop on the site. Present at the auction was Cody Docheff, whose family had previously owned the property. Heemeyer claimed that Cody Docheff had berated him for several minutes afterward out of anger at losing the property; however, no other party present recalled any such interaction.

The property had a rudimentary sewage storage solution in the form of a buried cement mixer left by the previous owners. The cost to update the sewer system would be nearly double the $42,000 Heemeyer paid for the property. 

City officials told Heemeyer that putting in a septic tank was a less expensive alternative, but he rejected both options and said that the government not paying for the sewage line hookup was &quot;extortion by government fiat&quot;. Despite these setbacks, he did not withdraw his annexation request and subsequently became part of the sewer district.

By 1993, Heemeyer had abandoned plans to rent the property to a friend and instead opened a muffler repair shop on the grounds. According to Heemeyer, his friend had lost interest in the property in around April 1992 because of oil spills and environmental issues.

In 1997, the Docheff family planned to expand their business to include a concrete batch plant and were buying up the land around their current lot, hoping to lease the remaining 23 parcels to small manufacturers. They were informed by the town planning commission that they needed a &quot;Planned Development Overlay District&quot; permit to construct the plant as part of their Mountain Park Concrete development. The commission also suggested that the Docheff family ask if they could purchase Heemeyer&#x27;s plot to keep the plant away from the hotels and businesses on Route 40.

Heemeyer asked for $250,000 () for his property, but later claimed he had had the lot reappraised and asked for an additional $125,000 (). The Docheffs managed to collect $350,000 (), but according to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer again upped his asking price, claiming he had the property appraised again at a higher value, this time asking for $450,000 (). This negotiation happened before the rezoning proposal had a public hearing at town hall.

Despite the deal falling through, the Docheff family pursued their plans to expand their business, and purchased a defunct commercial subdivision opposite Heemeyer&#x27;s lot. Heemeyer had attempted to buy this land just before the Docheffs, but was unsuccessful. He later proposed a land swap whereby he would receive the prime lot. The Docheffs initially accepted the offer, but Heemeyer demanded the Docheffs construct a new building on the lot at great expense. The negotiations fell apart, with Heemeyer stonewalling the Docheffs. 

Heemeyer launched a public campaign against the planned concrete plant. His campaign was initially successful, with members of the public concerned about potential environmental impacts packing into hearings on the construction proposals. The Docheffs addressed these concerns by promising to install additional measures against dust and noise and presented miniatures of the plant to concerned citizens. Opposition to the proposal dwindled, and the plan was set to move forward again. In November 2000, Heemeyer filed a lawsuit to block the project. 

A city clerk wrote a letter to the newspaper arguing that Heemeyer had a vendetta against the Docheffs. The clerk referenced Heemeyer&#x27;s increasingly &quot;exorbitant&quot; demands during negotiations for the sale of his property to the Docheffs, during which he had the land reappraised several times. 

By January 9, 2001, Heemeyer had lost most of his allies in opposition to the concrete plant, and city officials almost unanimously approved its construction. On January 9, 2001, the preliminary plans for the plant were approved near-unanimously, only Heemeyer remained opposed. This made the final approval by Granby&#x27;s zoning commission and trustees in April a formality. 

Heemeyer tried to appeal the decision, claiming the construction blocked access to his shop, which it never did according to the judge handling his case, a local journalist, and people inspecting aerial photography. He also complained to the Environmental Protection Agency; this resulted in the Docheff family having a professional noise analysis done. 

In June 2001, Joe Docheff made Heemeyer an offer whereby if Heemeyer dropped the lawsuit, they would provide him an easement to connect a sewer line to the new concrete plant free of charge; Heemeyer just hung up. Around this time, the buried concrete truck barrel that served as Heemeyer&#x27;s sewage hole filled up. Heemeyer responded by pumping his sewage with a gasoline pump into the irrigation ditch that ran behind his property. Heemeyer also attempted to illegally connect to a neighbor&#x27;s sewer line, but was caught and the incident reported to the sanitation district. At this point, the sewer district started enforcing the legal requirement to have a sewer hookup or a septic tank and fined Heemeyer $2,500 () for it and other city code violations at his business, in July 2001, nine years after he was required to have installed either. Heemeyer was found in contempt of town code in November 2001 by the municipal court, and required to fix the connection issues before he could inhabit or use the property for business purposes again, as well as remove the truck barrel before July 2003. Heemeyer agreed before later that day rejecting it, and describing the requirements as a &quot;form of terrorism.&quot; An attorney at the judgment reported Heemeyer muttering, &quot;I&#x27;m just gonna bulldozer this whole place to the ground.&quot;

==The bulldozer==

=== Planning and construction ===
After the lawsuit against the town was dismissed in April 2002, Heemeyer blamed the failure on his lawyer and demanded a refund. Knowing the zoning decision was now final, he traveled to California, bought a Komatsu D355A bulldozer in an auction for $16,000 () and had it shipped to Granby in July 2002. He kept it outside of his business with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign on it and tried to auction it, but few paid it any mind. In October 2002, he announced the closure of the muffler repair business, putting almost all of the inventory up for sale. When the bulldozer failed to sell, he saw it as a sign from God that he had to start his mission. He sold his property for $400,000 ()—around ten times the original purchase price—to a waste disposal company in October 2003 and took out a lease for half the building he had previously owned until he had &quot;finished some work.&quot; Within a day of the purchase closing, the new owners had completed water and sewer connections.

He erected a wall to separate his space from the rest of the building and changed the locks. While no one in Granby saw him, he worked on the bulldozer, illegally constructing living quarters to avoid having to return to his home in Grand Lake, which he saw as a waste of time that could be spent on the dozer. During this period, he dumped his sewage into the same irrigation ditch he had been caught dumping into several months earlier.

&quot;It is interesting to observe that I was never caught&quot;, Heemeyer wrote. &quot;This was a part-time project over a 1½-year time period.&quot; He was surprised that several men, who had visited the shed late the previous year, had not noticed the modified bulldozer &quot;especially with the lift fully exposed ... somehow their vision was clouded&quot;.

During this period, Heemeyer repeatedly mentioned the bulldozer to friends and associates, as well as his intention to use it for destructive purposes.

=== Specifications ===
The bulldozer was a modified Komatsu D355A, which he referred to as the &quot;MK Tank&quot; (or &quot;Marv&#x27;s Komatsu Tank&quot;) in audio recordings, fitted with makeshift composite armor plating covering the cabin, engine, and parts of the tracks. Three external explosions and more than 200 rounds of ammunition fired at the bulldozer had no effect on it.

For visibility, the bulldozer was fitted with several video cameras linked to two monitors mounted on the vehicle&#x27;s dashboard. The cameras were protected on the outside by shields of clear bulletproof lexan. Compressed-air nozzles were fitted to blow dust away from the video cameras. 

Onboard fans and an air conditioner were used to keep Heemeyer cool while driving. He had made three gun-ports, fitted for a .50-caliber rifle, a .308-caliber semi-automatic rifle, and a .22-caliber rifle, all fitted with a steel plate.

At the time of the demolition it also contained three handguns and enough food and water to last a week.

==Demolition and assault==
On June 4, 2004, starting at around 2:15 p.m., Heemeyer began his rampage by driving his armored bulldozer through Mountain Park Concrete, owned by the Docheff family. At the time of the attack, Cody Docheff was at the concrete plant, screening topsoil at the gravel pit, when he got a notification over his radio that there was an explosion at the precast shop. Several employees attempted to stop the bulldozer by cramming objects into the treads in order to jam it, but to no effect. Cody Docheff, initially believing the dozer to be under remote control, fired a pistol at it and attempted to climb on top, to no effect, before engaging the bulldozer with his own front-end loader, again to no success. During this time, Heemeyer fired multiple rounds at the loader. A deputy from the sheriff&#x27;s office arrived on the scene, followed by a Colorado State Patrol trooper, who was fired upon by Heemeyer. More deputies arrived and began firing on the dozer, attempting to destroy the cameras with gunfire, but were unable to penetrate the bulletproof plastic. At one point, Heemeyer charged at a firing position occupied by several state troopers, who evacuated mere seconds before he demolished it, with one eyewitness noting that had they taken any longer, they would have been killed.

After the concrete plant, Heemeyer turned onto Agate Avenue and headed south toward town at approximately . The officers at the plant requested a reverse 911 call be made to all residents in order to initiate evacuations. Undersheriff Glenn Trainer climbed atop the bulldozer and rode it &quot;like a bronc buster, trying to figure out a way to get a bullet inside the dragon&quot;. He also dropped a flash-bang grenade down the bulldozer&#x27;s exhaust pipe, with no apparent effect, and was later forced to jump down to avoid debris. 

Heemeyer then advanced on Granby Town Hall, which had been hosting a story hour for children in its library when the rampage began. All occupants were evacuated only moments before Heemeyer reached the building, an hour after the rampage began. Heemeyer turned to the Liberty Savings Bank, where he aimed at the corner office where a woman who was a part of the zoning board worked.

Police forces were unable to damage the bulldozer and so instead resorted to following it, jogging alongside it en masse. Heemeyer next targeted several street fixtures, such as trees and traffic lights, before moving on to the offices of the local newspaper, and in turn the homes of the Thompson family and their workplace. A scraper was brought up to try to stop the bulldozer, but it was pushed aside.

Heemeyer next targeted a propane storage yard, firing 15 bullets at the tanks, some of which contained . Police were forced to hurriedly evacuate all residents within a thousand yards of the site, including a senior housing complex. Heemeyer then fired upon nearby power transformers, with a high risk of igniting the tanks, but struggled to find a good angle. Heemeyer hit the transformers once and missed his other shots. &quot;Had these tanks ruptured and exploded, anyone within of the explosion could have been endangered&quot;, the sheriff&#x27;s department said. Twelve police officers and residents of a senior citizens complex were within such a range. After leaving, he was engaged by another scraper, which he similarly defeated.

At this point, local authorities and the Colorado State Patrol feared they were running out of options in terms of firepower, as the approximately 200 rounds fired by police had been ineffective up to that point, and that Heemeyer would soon turn against civilians in Granby. Governor Bill Owens allegedly considered authorizing the Colorado National Guard to use either an Apache attack helicopter equipped with a Hellfire missile or a two-man fire team equipped with a Javelin anti-tank missile to destroy the bulldozer. As late as 2011, Governor Owens&#x27;s staff vehemently denied considering such a course of action. Members of the State Patrol, however, claim that to the contrary, the governor did consider authorizing an attack, but ultimately decided against it due to the potential collateral damage of a missile strike in the heart of Granby being significantly higher than what Heemeyer could have caused with his bulldozer.

Heemeyer finally attacked the Gambles Store, targeting it due to the owner&#x27;s involvement in the hearings about the batch plant. As the bulldozer slowly plowed through the building, one of the previous scrapers was maneuvered onto the sidewalk, blocking it from retreating, after which the operator fled to safety. Unaware of a small basement on the property, Heemeyer dropped a tread into it as he continued through, immobilizing himself. The radiator had also been damaged, and the engine was leaking, before failing. As such, it was noted that even if Heemeyer had been able to free himself, the bulldozer would not have been able to operate much longer. About a minute later, at 16:30MST, one of the SWAT team members, who had swarmed around the machine, reported hearing a single gunshot from inside the cab. It was later determined that Heemeyer had shot himself in the head with a .357-caliber handgun.

Police first used explosives in an attempt to remove the steel plates for fear of booby traps, but after the third explosion failed, they cut through them with an oxyacetylene cutting torch. After getting inside, they found the access hatch and enough food and water to last a week. Grand County Emergency Management Director Jim Holahan stated that authorities were able to access and remove Heemeyer&#x27;s body at 2a.m. the next day, on June 5.

===Aftermath===
The attack lasted two hours and seven minutes, damaging 13 buildings, 11 of which were occupied until moments before their destruction. His targets included the town hall, the Sky-Hi newspaper office, Gambles General Store, Maple Street Builders, Mountain Parks Electric Co, Liberty Savings Bank, Kopy Kat Graphics, the wall of his former business, the home of a former mayor (in which the mayor&#x27;s 82-year-old widow then resided), and a hardware store owned by another man Heemeyer named in a lawsuit, as well as a few others. The rampage knocked out natural gas service to the town hall and the concrete plant, damaged a truck, and destroyed part of a utility service center. As part of the rampage, Heemeyer destroyed several trees outside a local business that the owner had previously claimed were hurting his business. The damage was estimated at $7million, $2million of which was to the concrete plant, which was underinsured, resulting in a payout of $700,000.

Many town records and archives were destroyed along with the town hall.

Defenders of Heemeyer said that he made a point of not hurting anybody during his bulldozer rampage. Ian Daugherty, a bakery owner, said Heemeyer &quot;went out of his way&quot; not to harm anyone. Cody Docheff stated that &quot;if Heemeyer truly didn&#x27;t want to hurt anybody, he would have plundered the center of town on the weekend, when most businesses would have been empty&quot;. The sheriff&#x27;s department said that the fact that no one was injured was not due to good intent as much as to good luck. 

On April 19, 2005, the town announced plans to scrap Heemeyer&#x27;s bulldozer. The plan involved dispersing individual pieces to many separate scrap yards to prevent souvenir-taking.

Although no one other than Heemeyer was killed in the incident, the modified bulldozer has occasionally been referred to as the &quot;Killdozer&quot;. It is unclear whether this is an allusion to the 1944 short story &quot;Killdozer!&quot; or its 1974 film adaptation, or if this is independent coinage.

Heemeyer has since gained supporters on the Internet who view his rampage as an act of patriotic civil disobedience against a corrupt government. Patrick Brower, a reporter who had covered Heemeyer&#x27;s numerous disputes for years and who was nearly killed during the attack, has reported receiving threatening and insulting comments as a result of pushing back against this narrative portraying Heemeyer as a hero and martyr.

==Motivation==
A search of Heemeyer&#x27;s house in Grand Lake, Colorado turned up plans for the bulldozer on his PC.

Investigators later found Heemeyer&#x27;s handwritten list of targets of 107 people who he thought had wronged him. The Docheff family was at the top of the list (written as &quot;Douche-eff&quot;). The list also included various buildings, companies, judges, politicians, newspaper editors and anyone who sided against him in past disputes. One entrant was the local Catholic Church (which he did not damage), due to their opposition to his attempts to legalize gambling, as well as theological differences as Heemeyer was a member of the Christian Reformed Church.

Prior to the rampage, Heemeyer had scrawled a list of complaints onto an old &quot;For Sale&quot; sign, as well as scrap paper. These ranged from the Docheffs&#x27; unwillingness to pay the large sums he requested, the sanitation district&#x27;s fining of him, and that the town had approved the plant construction. The other writings suggested that God had stopped the plant from being constructed in 1992, and alluded to a belief that God had caused the deaths of multiple people who had opposed him. Heemeyer further claimed that &quot;I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable&quot;, adding that &quot;Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things.&quot;

In addition to these writings, Heemeyer recorded three audio tapes explaining his motivation for the attack. The tapes contained two separate recordings on each side for a total of six recordings. He mailed these to his brother in South Dakota shortly before stepping into his bulldozer. Heemeyer&#x27;s brother turned the tapes over to the FBI, who in turn sent them to the Grand County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The tapes are about 2½ hours in length. The first recording was made on April 13, 2004. The last recording was made on May 22, 13 days before the rampage.

&quot;God built me for this job&quot;, Heemeyer said in the first recording. He also said it was God&#x27;s plan that he not be married or have a family so that he could be in a position to carry out such an attack. &quot;I think God will bless me to get the machine done, to drive it, to do the stuff that I have to do&quot;, he said. &quot;God blessed me in advance for the task that I am about to undertake. It is my duty. God has asked me to do this. It&#x27;s a cross that I am going to carry and I&#x27;m carrying it in God&#x27;s name.&quot;

Other statements included in the tapes make mention of Heemeyer&#x27;s view that he was an &quot;American Patriot&quot;, with local journalist Patrick Brower suggesting this may be indicative of links to the broader patriot movement.

<text>The Sunwapta River is a major tributary of the Athabasca River in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Sunwapta River are near the Columbia Icefield in the valley west-northwest of Sunwapta Pass, which divides Jasper National Park from Banff National Park. Several kilometres down the valley from the pass is Sunwapta Lake, at the toe of the Athabasca Glacier, which is considered the nominal source for the river. The Sunwapta River then continues to run northwest through Jasper National Park, following the Icefields Parkway, and finally joins the Athabasca River shortly after Sunwapta Falls.

&quot;Sunwapta&quot; is a Stoney language word meaning &quot;turbulent river&quot;. Geologist A. P. Coleman named the river in 1892.

<text>Brothers is an unincorporated community in Deschutes County, Oregon, United States on U.S. Route 20. It is part of the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical Area. It lies at an elevation of above sea level.

==History==

Originally a stagecoach stop between Burns and Prineville, the Brothers Stage Stop was built in 1912. It was a gas station, restaurant, and post office up until around 2018. It has changed owners a few times over the years and is currently not in operation.

Brothers post office was established in 1913. One source says that the name comes from several families of brothers who settled in the area, including the Stenkamp Brothers and Varco(e) Brothers, while another notes that there was a local Three Brothers Sheep Camp, named for three nearby hills that had the Three Sisters mountains looming behind them.

Vast tracts of uninhabited land covered with sagebrush surround Brothers, which are often used for model and high power rocket launches by Oregon Rocketry which has one of the highest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airspace waivers in the United States at .

==Climate==
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Brothers has a steppe climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.


==Transportation==
In the 21st century, Brothers is a stop on the Eastern POINT intercity bus line between Bend and Ontario. It makes one stop per day in each direction.

==Education==
In 1969 the local school had eight students.

<doc id="707411" wikidata="Q255189" url="?curid=707411" title="Paraphrase">
<text>A paraphrase or rephrase () is the rendering of the same text in different words without losing the meaning of the text itself. More often than not, a paraphrased text can convey its meaning better than the original words. In other words, it is a copy of the text in meaning, but which is different from the original. For example, when someone tells a story they heard, in their own words, they paraphrase, with the meaning being the same. The term itself is derived via Latin &quot;&quot;, . The act of paraphrasing is also called &quot;paraphrasis&quot;.

==History==
Although paraphrases likely abounded in oral traditions, paraphrasing as a specific educational exercise dates back to at least Roman times, when the author Quintilian recommended it for students to develop dexterity in language. In the Middle Ages, this tradition continued, with authors such as Geoffrey of Vinsauf developing schoolroom exercises that included both rhetorical manipulations and paraphrasing as a way of generating poems and speeches. There is interest in the study of paraphrases relating to concerns around plagiarism and original authorship.

==Types==
For the purposes of education, Fred Inglis identifies five levels of paraphrase:
#replacing words with synonyms
#varying sentence structure
#reordering information
#turning long sentences into multiple shorter ones (or vice versa)
#expressing abstract concepts more concretely.

Paraphrasing with synonyms is considered by some to be an acceptable stage in teaching paraphrase, but it is necessary that it is ultimately combined with techniques for altering sentence structure to avoid the appearance of plagiarism. Studies of English language students have found that ESL learners tend to rely on using synonyms rather than changing sentence structure when paraphrasing. Participants in a study of some Vietnamese ESL learners expressed that they preferred using synonyms out of a fear that using the wrong sentence structure would lead to the sentence having a different meaning. Na and Mai suggest that ESL teachers should provide varied activities including tasks requiring changes in syntax, and that ESL students should be given source texts to paraphrase whose meaning they are already readily able to understand.

Natural Language Processing researchers have defined various (atomic) paraphrase types to better understand how paraphrasing occurs in humans. These types fall into six broad categories, each reflecting different ways in which a text can be altered to convey the same or similar meaning:

# morphology-based changes
# lexicon-based changes
# lexico-syntactic based changes
# syntax-based changes
# discourse-based changes
# extremes.

Morphology-based changes involve alterations at the level of word formation, such as changing the tense of verbs or the number of nouns. For instance, converting &quot;walks&quot; to &quot;walked&quot; represents a morphological change by altering the verb&#x27;s tense. Lexicon-based changes include changes made by substituting words with their synonyms or closely related words without significantly altering the sentence structure. An example could be changing &quot;quick&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; in a sentence, where both adjectives convey a similar speed attribute. Lexico-syntactic-based changes contain both lexical alterations and modifications in the sentence structure. An example might be transforming an active voice sentence like &quot;The cat chased the mouse&quot; into a passive voice &quot;The mouse was chased by the cat,&quot; where both the sentence structure and some words are altered. Syntax-based changes are primarily focused on the structure of the sentence rather than the words themselves. For example, changing a complex sentence into two simpler sentences while maintaining the overall meaning falls into this category. Discourse-based changes are alterations that affect the larger discourse or text structure, such as reordering points in a paragraph or changing the way arguments are presented without altering the factual content. Extremes include changes that significantly alter the text, possibly introducing new information or omitting crucial details, thus pushing the boundaries of what might typically be considered a paraphrase.

Machine learning models have been trained to generate paraphrases with specific properties, such as high semantic similarity and syntactic diversity, or to generate specific paraphrase types. Models that have high capacity in paraphrasing can be used for various applications. For example, the granular understanding of the linguistic changes involved in paraphrase generation could be directly applied to support language learners. A model can provide simpler paraphrases considering specific linguistic variations (e.g., syntax) to support students in learning new words and concepts. Universities could create a linguistic profile of their students based on their assignments and better assess their thesis with content similarity detection for potential plagiarism cases. Different types of paraphrases such as syntax and lexicon changes have also been used for prompt engineering to adjust prompts in specific linguistic aspects to achieve better model outputs.

==Analysis==
A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, &quot;The signal was red&quot; might be paraphrased as &quot;The train was not allowed to pass as the red signal light was illuminated&quot;. A paraphrase can be introduced with &quot;verbum dicendi&quot;—a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in &quot;The author states &#x27;The signal was red,&#x27; &quot;that is&quot;, the train was not allowed to proceed,&quot; the &quot;that is&quot; signals the paraphrase that follows.

A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct quotation. The paraphrase typically serves to put the source&#x27;s statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a summary. One should add the source at the end of the sentence: When the light was red, trains could not go (Wikipedia). A paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential meaning of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as &quot;original research,&quot; and not a paraphrase. Unlike a metaphrase, which represents a &quot;formal equivalent&quot; of the source, a paraphrase represents a &quot;dynamic equivalent&quot; thereof. While a metaphrase attempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential thought expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of literality. For details, see dynamic and formal equivalence.

==In your own words==
The phrase &quot;in your own words&quot; is often used within this context to imply that the writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style – how they would have written it if they had created the idea. Nowadays, there are some models to learn and recognize paraphrase on natural language texts. Sentences can also be automatically paraphrased using text simplification software.

<text>The northern grey-headed sparrow (Passer griseus), also known as the grey-headed sparrow, is a species of bird in the sparrow family Passeridae, which is resident in much of tropical Africa. It occurs in a wide range of open habitats, including open woodlands and human habitation, often occupying the same niche as the house sparrow does in Eurasia.

The adult northern grey-headed sparrow has a pale grey head with a white moustache stripe, pale brown upperparts, whitish underparts and chestnut wings with a small white shoulder patch. The sexes are similar, but young birds are slightly duller and lack the white wing patch. There are three subspecies, differing in plumage tone, especially with regard to the darkness of the head.

This sparrow is mainly resident in its range, but there is some seasonal movement, and flocks of up to 50 birds form outside the breeding season. It builds a cup nest in trees, thatch, or old nests of other birds; 2–4 eggs are laid.

This species feeds principally on seeds and grain, like other sparrows, but will readily take insects including termites, especially when feeding young.

The calls include cheeps and chirps, and the typical sparrow churring alarm call.

The northern grey-headed sparrow is replaced in eastern and southern Africa by very similar birds that are sometimes considered races of this species: Swainson&#x27;s sparrow, the parrot-billed sparrow, the Swahili sparrow, and the southern grey-headed sparrow.

<doc id="707422" wikidata="Q7844698" url="?curid=707422" title="Trix (cereal)">
<text>Trix is an American brand of breakfast cereal made by General Mills in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for the North American market and by Cereal Partners (using the Nestlé brand) elsewhere in the world. The cereal consists of fruit-flavored, sweetened, ground-corn pieces. 

The Trix trademark is also used by Yoplait (a yogurt company, mostly owned by General Mills) for a line of similarly flavored yogurt marketed toward children.

==History==

General Mills introduced Trix in 1954 as a sugar-coated version of its popular Kix cereal. The original Trix cereal was composed of more than 46% sugar. The original cereal included three colors: &quot;Orangey Orange&quot; (formerly named Orange Orange), &quot;Lemony Yellow&quot; (formerly named Lemon Yellow), and &quot;Raspberry Red&quot;. Five fruit shapes and colors were added over the years: &quot;Grapity (or Grapey) Purple&quot; (1984–present), &quot;Lime Green&quot; (1991–1998, 2007–2015, 2017–present), &quot;Wildberry Blue&quot; (1996–2007, 2018–present), &quot;Berry Blue&quot; (2007–2015, 2017–present), and &quot;Watermelon&quot; (1998–2007, 2018–present). In 1991 and again in 1995, the cereal pieces were given a brighter, more colorful look. General Mills&#x27; Yoplait division produces a Trix-branded yogurt marketed to children with sweetened fruit flavors such as &quot;Watermelon Burst&quot;. Later, Trix Swirls were introduced, with flavors such as &quot;Rasp-orangey orange swirl&quot; (a mix of the Orangey orange and Raspberry red flavors). A new flavor, &quot;Wildberry Red Swirl&quot;, was introduced in 2011. Trix Swirls have since been discontinued, and the pieces in the original Trix were changed to their original 2007 flavor and shape lineup in 2014.

The cereal originally used spherical cereal pieces, but in 1991 these were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces, presumably to avoid clashing with Berry Berry Kix when it was introduced in 1992. In 2007, Trix reverted to their original shapes in the United States, to the dismay of the fans. Mexico was the only country to maintain fruit-shaped pieces until around late 2018 when they were reintroduced globally.

In 2015, General Mills announced it would no longer use artificial colors in its cereals, and Trix would be among the first to change. Trix would go from six colors to four because satisfactory natural alternatives were found for orange, yellow, red, and purple, but not blue or green.

On September 21, 2017, General Mills announced that the six-color version of Trix cereal would be reintroduced back to the market and that artificial dyes and flavors would be utilized to do so after customers complained about the naturally-flavored Trix. The four-color, non-artificial-dye/flavor version would continue to be sold. In that same announcement, General Mills said they would revert to the puffed fruit-shaped pieces, which happened around late 2018.

==Marketing and advertising==

By 1955, just one year after Trix&#x27;s market debut, General Mills experimented with a rabbit puppet as a potential Trix mascot. Joe Harris, a copywriter and illustrator at the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency, created the trademark animated &quot;Silly Rabbit,&quot; who debuted in a 1959 television commercial for the cereal. Harris also wrote the iconic Trix tagline, &quot;Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!&quot;, which is still used in General Mills&#x27; commercial campaigns, it is also used at the end of every commercial when the children claim that the cereal itself is for themselves, as that&#x27;s what they tell to the rabbit.

Chet Stover, creative director of the Trix account at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, fully credited Harris with the creation of the Trix rabbit after viewing the new character in its 1959 television commercial for the cereal. In an internal memo to Dancer Fitzgerald Sample employees, Stover wrote, &quot;In a business where the only thing we have to sell are ideas, it is of first importance the credit is given where credit belongs — and Joe gets all the credit for this one.&quot;

The Trix Rabbit—voiced by Mort Marshall in earlier commercials, and by Russell Horton in later commercials—is an anthropomorphic cartoon rabbit who finds children and wants to trick the children into giving him a bowl of cereal. He bursts with enthusiasm but is discovered every time. The kids always reprimand him with the signature phrase: &quot;Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!&quot; at the end of the commercials. These ads in the late 1960s and early 1970s sometimes closed with the Trix Rabbit following up with &quot;And sometimes for tricky rabbits!&quot; (This happened in case he managed to have a taste or he had a secret stash.) The Trix Rabbit originated as a puppet before he was animated. The plight of the Trix Rabbit has drawn comparisons to Sisyphus, a Greek figure who was doomed to endlessly repeat a futile task. He did succeed in obtaining and eating Trix cereal on occasion, including five times as the result of a box top mail-in contest (1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, and 1991) titled &quot;Let The Rabbit Eat Trix&quot;. The results of the vote were overwhelmingly &quot;yes&quot;, and the Trix Rabbit was depicted in a subsequent commercial enjoying a bowl of Trix. Children who voted received a button based upon their vote in the election. In 1991, the Trix Rabbit won a Tour de Trix Bicycle Race. At the end of the race, two judges are arguing about whether or not the Trix Rabbit should get the prize. To decide the fate of the prize, the children are called upon to send in their votes. The result was &quot;yes&quot; and the Trix Rabbit got the prize, much to his delight.

In commercials from 1967, the 1970s, and the 1980s, the Trix Rabbit disguised himself to get the cereal, employing costumes as diverse as a balloon vendor, a painter and an American Indian. One alternate slogan for the cereal was, &quot;Oranges, Lemons, and Grapes I see; the fruit taste of Trix is all for me!&quot;. Once, Bugs Bunny helped the Trix Rabbit in an attempt to get the cereal.

The Trix Rabbit&#x27;s popularity led him to appear in commercials for other products, such as a Got Milk? advertisement, in which he disguises himself as a man (played by Harland Williams) taking Trix from a grocery store but realizing he is out of milk, much to his distress.

<text>Neo-progressive rock (commonly abbreviated neo-prog) is a subgenre of progressive rock that developed in the UK in the early 1980s. The genre&#x27;s most popular band, Marillion, achieved mainstream success in the decade. Several bands from the genre have continued to record and tour.

== Characteristics ==
Neo-prog is characterised by deeply emotional content, often delivered via dramatic lyrics and a generous use of imagery and theatricality on-stage. The music is mostly the product of careful composition, relying less heavily on improvised jamming. The subgenre relies very much on clean, melodic and emotional electric guitar solos, combined with keyboards. The main musical influences on the neo-prog genre are bands from the first wave of progressive rock such as early Genesis, Camel, and to a lesser extent Van der Graaf Generator and Pink Floyd. Funk, hard rock and punk rock were also influences on the genre.

== History ==
In the book &quot;The Progressive Rock Files&quot;, author Jerry Lucky dedicates a chapter to neo-progressive rock with the title &quot;A Neo Beginning!&quot;, stating that this subgenre &quot;surfaced in late 1981, bearing testimony to the lasting values of this musical form&quot; of progressive rock, but distinguishing it from this main genre, saying, &quot;Sure the sound was a bit different ... a little more bite, a little more eighties&quot;. Later in the same book, Jerry Lucky suggested that neo-prog peaked in the mid-1980s: &quot;As 1984 dawned all of the British neo-progressive rock bands release material.&quot; Famous neo-prog albums were Marillion&#x27;s &quot;Fugazi&quot;, Pallas&#x27; &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, Pendragon&#x27;s &quot;Fly High Fall Far&quot;, Twelfth Night&#x27;s &quot;Art and Illusion&quot;, Solstice&#x27;s &quot;Silent Dance&quot;, IQ&#x27;s &quot;The Wake&quot;, and Quasar&#x27;s &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;.

A predecessor to this genre was The Enid, who fused rock with classical but were more heavily influenced by Ralph Vaughan Williams than by more modern composers. The change of approach can be heard in the shift toward shorter compositions and a keyboard-based sound in the 1980s Rush albums &quot;Signals,&quot; &quot;Grace Under Pressure,&quot; &quot;Power Windows&quot; and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;. Neo-progressive bands emphasised individual solos instead of group improvisation, and they included more world-music elements. Lyrics became more personal and less esoteric. Concept albums were still created, but not as frequently and on a smaller scale. Digital synthesizers took over many of the roles formerly filled by bulkier keyboards such as Mellotrons and organs, and their modern sound tended to minimise the folk influences that had been typical of 1970s progressive rock. Heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Queensrÿche began to explore the mythological themes and extended concepts that had previously been the territory of progressive rock.

Early neo-prog was marked by sophisticated lyrics and often dark themes. While the accessibility of neo-prog to the mainstream is debatable, the form did generally seem more radio-friendly, with shorter and less complex songs than earlier progressive rock. Nonetheless, neo-prog never achieved the heights of popular success that the first wave of progressive rock in the 1970s did, with only one band, Marillion, achieving arena status. Marillion achieved major success across Europe in particular and produced eight top ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, peaking in popularity with their album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; in 1985, which topped the UK album chart and produced two top five hit singles in the UK. The album has been called &quot;the cornerstone of the entire &#x27;neo-prog&#x27; movement&quot;. Following this peak, neo-prog declined in popularity as a genre, although several bands have continued to record and tour, with Marillion and their ex-singer Fish in particular both maintaining a large cult following. They would also spawn a sci-fi based trans-Atlantic Neo-Prog side project in Edison&#x27;s Children in 2011 starring, Marillion&#x27;s Pete Trewavas and NYC&#x27;s Major Motion Picture Special FX Technician Eric Blackwood. Their first album, &quot;In The Last Waking Moments...&quot;, marks the only time that all active members of Marillion (and Robin Boult, the lead guitarist of Fish) appeared on the same album that was not an official Marillion album. &quot;&quot;In The Last Waking Moments&quot;...&#x27;&quot; Extraterrestrial / Alien Abduction theme garnered tremendous attention including the Top 40 FM Radio Hit &quot;A &quot;Million Miles Away (I Wish I Had A Time Machine&quot;&quot; marking the first time that Neo-Prog has had an FM hit since the Alan Parsons Project in the early 1990&#x27;s returning Neo-Prog back to its former glory. Giorgio A. Tsoukalos of Ancient Aliens fame brought more attention to the &quot;alien based&quot; concept album through social media and most importantly the attention of the NASA Apollo 11 Neil Armstrong family including Neil&#x27;s musical son Rick Armstrong who requested to. become a permanent member of Edison&#x27;s Children during the Marillion 2013 Weekend tour in Montreal which he was granted and has contributed to Edison&#x27;s Children&#x27;s next four Supernatural / Extraterrestrial / Apocalyptic-based double LPs. This culminated in the 2019 concert celebration for the Astronaut Scholarship Fund&#x27;s concert celebration for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, starring Neil Armstrong&#x27;s son Rick Armstrong performing with his band Edison&#x27;s Children; they then joined the Alan Parsons Project later in the evening for a two band encore &quot;mashup&quot;. Along with Marillion, Fish and Edison&#x27;s Children, alternative rock band Radiohead&#x27;s ambitious work has been credited with inspiring a revival of interest in progressive rock.

<text>The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA), formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), is the academic consortium of the universities in the Big Ten Conference. The consortium was renamed on June 29, 2016.

== Member universities ==
The Big Ten Academic Alliance is an academic consortium of the 18 institutions that are members of the Big Ten Conference. The University of Chicago, a former Big Ten Conference member, was a member of the CIC from 1958 to June 29, 2016.

Current members:
* Indiana University Bloomington
* Michigan State University
* Northwestern University
* Ohio State University
* Pennsylvania State University
* Purdue University
* Rutgers University–New Brunswick
* University of California Los Angeles
* University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign
* University of Iowa
* University of Maryland, College Park
* University of Michigan
* University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
* University of Nebraska–Lincoln
* University of Oregon
* University of Southern California
* University of Washington
* University of Wisconsin–Madison
== History ==
The Committee on Institutional Cooperation was established by the presidents of the Big Ten members in 1958 as the conference&#x27;s academic counterpart. An invitation extended to the University of Chicago, one of the founding members of the Big Ten who withdrew from the conference in 1946, was accepted.

Following its admittance to the Big Ten in 1990, the CIC invited Pennsylvania State University to join the consortium. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln also joined the consortium in 2011 following the school&#x27;s admittance to the Big Ten.

The University of Maryland and Rutgers University, who joined the Big Ten in 2014, joined the consortium on July 1, 2013.

The University of California Los Angeles, the University of Southern California, the University of Oregon, and the University of Washington joined the consortium on August 2, 2024.

On June 29, 2016, the name of the consortium was changed from &quot;Committee on Institutional Cooperation&quot; to &quot;Big Ten Academic Alliance&quot;. The University of Chicago, a former Big Ten Conference member and former member of the CIC, is not a member of the rebranded consortium, but continues to participate in programs through an affiliation agreement.

== Statistics ==
When considered collectively, BTAA universities educate over 700,000 students, including approximately 525,000 full-time undergraduate students and over 175,000 full-time graduate students. BTAA universities award 29% of all agriculture Ph.D.s, 18% of engineering Ph.D.s, and 18% of humanities Ph.D.s in the United States annually.

BTAA members, when viewed collectively, conducted a combined total of $17.4 billion in funded research and BTAA libraries own over 140 million volumes.

Collectively, BTAA members employ approximately 57,000 full-time instructional staff.

== Collaboration ==
The BTAA&#x27;s collaborative efforts span the academic enterprise of its members, including:

*cooperative purchasing and licensing
*course sharing
*professional development programs
*library resources
*information technology
*international collaborations
*faculty networking
*participant in Google Books Library Project

== Cancer Research Consortium ==
A related institution to the BTAA, the Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium (BTCRC) unites the cancer research centers of Big Ten universities through collaborative oncology trials. 14 members of the BTAA are members of the BTCRC, as well as the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). Plans are in place to expand membership to include the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Southern California, the University of Oregon, and the University of Washington with the addition of these universities to the Big Ten. Current member cancer centers are as follows:

* Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center
* Michigan State University Cancer Research

<text>Perrey and Kingsley (known also as &quot;Perrey &amp; Kingsley&quot; or &quot;Perrey-Kingsley&quot;) was an electronic music duo made up of French composer Jean-Jacques Perrey and German-American composer Gershon Kingsley. The duo lasted from 1965 to 1967 and both are considered pioneers of electronic music. They released under Vanguard Records two studio albums &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot; and &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot;. They also were among the first artists to incorporate the Moog synthesizer, prior to the successful 1968 release, &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; by Wendy Carlos.

== History ==
=== 1964–1966: &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot; ===

Gershon Kingsley was a German-American Vanguard Records arranger since 1964, he fled Nazi Germany to reach then Mandatory Palestine (present-day Israel) a few days before Kristallnacht in 1938. After World War II he came to Los Angeles in 1946, where he studied at the Conservatory of Music, adopted the pseudonym &quot;Gershon&quot; in tribute to the son of Moses and worked in Broadway productions. Jean-Jacques Perrey was a French accordion player and medical student who abandoned his studies after meeting Georges Jenny, the inventor of the Ondioline that hired Perrey as a salesman in the late 1950s. At the Studio of Contemporary Music Research in France, Perrey met Pierre Schaeffer, who had pioneered the avant-garde sound art form known as &quot;musique concrète&quot;. Thereafter, Perrey began to experiment with tape manipulation.

Perrey and Kingsley met in 1964 at the Carroll Music Service led by Carroll Bratman in New York City. Perrey signed a contract with Vanguard Records and their first recording for the label was &quot;The Little Man From Mars&quot; (included in the 1966 album, &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot;). The two spent 275 hours producing and recording the album, Perrey also played Ondioline, provided musique concrète &quot;rhythmic patterns&quot;, and mixed his tape loops and &quot;inventive melodies&quot; with Kingsley&#x27;s arrangements and instrumentation. Some tracks from this album versioned classical music pieces: &quot;Swan&#x27;s Splashdown&quot; is a version of &quot;Danse des petits cygnes&quot; from Pyotr Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Swan Lake ballet and &quot;Countdown At 6&quot; is a version of &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; by Ponchielli. 

The &quot;baby cooing&quot; sound clip used in &quot;Countdown At 6&quot; was extracted from &quot;Authentic Sound Effects Volume 8&quot; (1964), later that same sound would be used by Aaliyah in her 1998 single, &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot;. &quot;Barnyard In Orbit&quot; composed by Perrey and Sam Fiedel for the library album &quot;Musique Electronique du Cosmos&quot; (1962) was reworked for this album. The artwork was designed by American painter Jules Halfant. &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot; was released on Vanguard label in 1966. &quot;Visa To The Stars&quot;, co-written by Angelo Badalamenti (under the pseudonym &quot;Andy Badale&quot;) was released as promotional single in March 1967 with &quot;Spooks In Space&quot; as B side. In his album review, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that the &quot;recording of electronic pop music created by Gershon Kingsley and Jean Jacques Perrey is so far out it may become in.&quot; 

In AllMusic, Richie Unterberger wrote that &quot;this early attempt to bring electronic music to the masses is commendable&quot; and that &quot;is cheesy enough to skirt the boundaries of kitsch, with a boxy, mechanical texture and a music-box-run-amok feel.&quot; He but added that, &quot;There is a goofy charm to the mischievous placement of burps, gurgles, animal noises, and naive outer space-tinged themes&quot; and concluded stating which the album has &quot;material that would be far more at home on the soundtrack of a children&#x27;s TV cartoon than a work of contemporary composition, this album is more of a curiosity than anything else.&quot; It was chosen as one of the «ten basic space age pop albums» by The Space Age Pop Music Page. In that same year they performed on the American game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; in which Perrey imitated four orchestral instruments with the Ondioline, and then played with Kingsley one of the album tracks (&quot;Spooks In Space&quot;, an electronic version of Saint-Saëns&#x27;s Danse macabre).

=== 1967–1972: &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot; ===
For the second studio album &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music From Way Out&quot;, the duo incorporated the Moog synthesizer, with added special effects. It was played together with the Ondioline and is the second to be sold. &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot; was released on Vanguard label in 1967. It is a mix between original tracks by Perrey and Kingsley like &quot;The Savers&quot; or &quot;Fallout&quot; and synthesized interpretations of &quot;Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;Strangers In The Night&quot;, &quot;Lover&#x27;s Concerto&quot;, &quot;Third Man Theme&quot;, Winchester Cathedral, Moon River, Mas que Nada and other pop songs from time. 

&quot;The Savers&quot; was released as single in December 9, 1967 with &quot;Piooners Of The Stars&quot; as the B side. &quot;Piooners Of The Stars&quot; co-written also by Badale had a very old version that was included in the 2017 compilation album titled &quot;Jean-Jacques Perrey et son Ondioline&quot;. Some outlets such as AllMusic or NTS Radio cited the influence that Joe Meek style had on Badale&#x27;s collaborations with the duo. In a retrospective review, Richie Unterberger from AllMusic commented that, &quot;It was still largely devoted to kitschy electro treatments of standards&quot;. In late 1960s, it was reissued with a new artwork and new additional title, &quot;Spotlight on the Moog&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot;, the duet disbanded, and Jean-Jacques Perrey recorded other two studio albums with the Vanguard Records label: &quot;The Amazing New Electronic Pop Sound of Jean Jacques Perrey&quot; (1968) and &quot;Moog Indigo&quot; (1970). Gershon Kingsley released in 1969 the solo studio album &quot;Music to Moog By&quot; on Audio Fidelity Records label. It included the original version of Popcorn, which would later reach a great popularity and success with the version of Hot Butter in 1972. 

In later years, several compilation albums of his work were released. In 1975, compilation album &quot;The Essential Perrey &amp; Kingsley&quot; was released, the following year it was described by &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine as an &quot;a fine novelty album: one tires of it after four or five cuts, but in the meantime one is treated to an almost bewildering variety of silly synthesizer sounds.&quot; In 2001, a triple CD entitled &quot;The Out Sound From Way In!&quot; was released, which compiles four Perrey albums, two as a duet and solo, plus seven remixes of Perrey and Kingsley&#x27;s work, including two remixes from the &quot;Moog Indigo&quot; song, &quot;E.V.A.&quot; by Fatboy Slim and five by Eurotrash.

== Legacy and influence ==
Some tracks by Perrey and Kingsley were licensed for radio and television commercials, the final track from &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot;, &quot;Visa To The Stars&quot; was used in a commercial for the Esso oil company. In 1968, &quot;The Savers&quot;, from &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot;, won a Clio Award when it was used as the soundtrack for a No-Cal diet soft drink commercial; later it would be used as opening theme from the American television game show The Joker&#x27;s Wild since 1972 to 1975. Some tracks from &quot;The In Sound From Way Out!&quot; were used in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. &quot;Electronic Can-Can&quot; was the theme music for &quot;Wonderama&quot;, a Metromedia children program of 1970s. WNYW 5 in New York used it in the 1980s to introduce its &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon franchise. 

&quot;Baroque Hoedown&quot;, from &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations&quot; was the main theme for Disney&#x27;s Main Street Electrical Parade and &quot;El Chapulin Colorado&quot;. It was also sampled by rock band The Beatles in their 1968 Christmas Record. A parody of the Saturday Night Live broadcast on October 23, 1976 and titled &quot;Jeopardy! 1999&quot; used the 1966 track &quot;Unidentified Flying Object&quot; as opening and closing theme. In 1996 the Beastie Boys released a compilation album with a cover inspired by his 1966 album and also used the same title. In 1997, the Alternative rock band Smash Mouth released Walkin&#x27; on the Sun, a single whose bassline and opening melody is based on the track &quot;Swan&#x27;s Splashdown&quot;.

<text>The Internet Radio Linking Project, also called IRLP links amateur radio stations around the world by using Voice over IP (VoIP). Each gateway consists of a dedicated computer running custom software that is connected to both a radio and the Internet. This arrangement forms what is known as an IRLP Node. Since all end users communicate using a radio as opposed to using a computer directly, IRLP has adopted the motto &quot;Keeping the Radio in Amateur Radio&quot;.

Amateur radio operators (&quot;hams&quot;) within radio range of a local node are able to use DTMF tone generators to initiate a node-to-node connection with any other available node in the world. Each node has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 1000–8999. A real-time searchable list of all nodes worldwide (including their current status) is available anytime by viewing the IRLP Network at a Glance. As of February 2019, there are over 1,500 active nodes.

IRLP connections are of two types: node to node, and node to reflector. Stations wishing to communicate with 3 or more nodes at the same time may accomplish this by connecting to what is called an IRLP Reflector. Reflectors are a type of conferencing system. Most reflectors on the network have 10 channels (0–9) with channel 0 being the main channel. Each reflector has a unique 4 digit node number in the range of 9000–9999. The first 3 digits consist of the reflector number, while the fourth digit represents the channel number. As of April 2007, there are 20 operational reflectors (including Echo Reflector 9990, which digitally records and plays back transmissions for testing purposes). Since most reflectors have 10 channels, there are approximately 200 unique reflector channels available for use.

==History==

IRLP was invented by David &quot;Dave&quot; Cameron, VE7LTD. Born and raised in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Cameron attended the University of British Columbia where he joined the UBC Amateur Radio Society. He built his first repeater and computer-based repeater controller in the 1990s.

Cameron installed the first three IRLP nodes in November 1997. They used the Windows operating system (OS) with VocalTec&#x27;s iPhone installed. There were problems with the software, mainly in the fact that iPhone is not very stable nor is it controllable. After running iPhone for close to 6 months on active connections to Vernon, British Columbia, Canada and Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Cameron decided to rebuild the nodes and essentially start over. This is when the Linux OS and the Speak Freely software were first tested.

On November 12, 1998, the VE7RHS node was first installed in Gage Towers, UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada using Linux. A few days later, the VE7RVN node came online from the residence of Michael Paul Illingby, VE7TFD in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada. Since this point, no further problems were experienced. This planted the seed for the IRLP network to grow. New nodes slowly launched across Canada, followed by the United States and worldwide.

Node numbers were originally set at 3 digits in length. Due to the extensive growth of the IRLP network, an extra digit needed to be added in 2002. Existing node numbers after this change received a trailing zero. For example, if the old node number was 123, it became 1230. Most existing reflectors were also converted from single channels to 10 channels. This new type of reflector was known as a super-reflector. After all the reflectors were converted the &quot;super-&quot; was dropped...

===Operating system===

Linux is the operating system (OS) of choice for IRLP, as it allows the best in reliability, programmability, efficiency, and functionality. Some older IRLP nodes use the Red Hat 7.3 or Red Hat 9 distribution, as they were very stable releases and ran very smoothly on any Pentium or better computer. In 2005, a custom version of Fedora Core 3 was introduced, followed by Fedora Core 5 in 2006. As of March 2007, IRLP no longer supports Red Hat and started shipping with the CentOS 4 distribution. As of December 2012, IRLP has released a final version of CentOS 4.9, but now supports Debian as its operating system of choice. This release provides greatly improved operation with more support for varying hardware.

===IRLP hardware===

An IRLP board is required to interface to the radio. Currently version 3.0 IRLP boards are available fully assembled and tested. Each board comes complete with all the cables between the board and computer parallel port (with sub-hoods) and terminates in a male DE-9 connector for interface into the radio. A cable terminated in a female DE-9 plugs into the IRLP board and interfaces to a radio/repeater/controller. Two mono or stereo 1/8&quot; audio plugs connect to the computer&#x27;s sound card. The audio circuitry is the owner&#x27;s responsibility.

The IRLP board is a very simple circuit, the most difficult part being the DTMF decoder which consists of a MT8870 (or similar) DTMF decoder IC and HCF4081 (or similar) and-gate IC. Two chips are needed because the MT8870 has latched outputs, and the IRLP software looks for short pulses at the parallel port pins 10,12,13,15 in order to acknowledge a DTMF digit. MT8870 pin 15 provides a pulse when any valid DTMF digit is decoded, so this signal is used on one input of each gate on the HCF4081. The other gate input is from MT8870 pins 11,12,13,14. The output of the HCF4081 (pins 3,4,10,11) connect to the parallel port and provide the pulsed input that IRLP needs.

The IRLP software cannot decode the D digit (the bottom right key on a 16-button DTMF dial). This is a limitation of the hardware in the decoder. DTMF digit D is logic level 0 on all 4 bits from the MT8870. Thus, the parallel port pins would all be at 0 volts, which IRLP regards as no DTMF digit present. The IRLP board does not pass the MT8870&#x27;s strobe pin to the PC, if it did that would enable digit D detection.

The IRLP board has no audio transformers or bypass capacitors. It is merely a DTMF decoder circuit with a simple COS and PTT circuit installed. Version 3 boards also have simple FET switches for the AUX 1,2 and 3 functions.

== Parallel port pin assignments ==
===RF hardware===

A link radio or repeater is needed to interface to the IRLP board. The radio&#x27;s COS (carrier operated squelch) and PTT lines must be available to the IRLP board. Additionally, courtesy tones, hang time, and node IDs must not be transmitted over the VoIP link. This can easily be accomplished using CTCSS on the repeater transmitter that follows the COS of the receiver.

<text>The Battle of Stoney Creek was a British victory over an American force fought on 6 June 1813, during the War of 1812 near what is now Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada. British units made a night attack on the American encampment, and due in large part to the capture of the two senior officers of the American force and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the outcome of the battle was a total victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada.

==Background==
On 27 May, the Americans had won the Battle of Fort George, forcing the British defenders of Fort George into a hasty retreat. The British commander, Brigadier General John Vincent, gathered in all his outposts along the Niagara River, disbanded the militia contingents in his force and retreated to Burlington Heights (at the west end of Burlington Bay), with about 1,600 men in total. The Americans under the overall leadership of General Henry Dearborn, who was elderly and ill, were slow to pursue. A brigade under Brigadier General William H. Winder first followed up Vincent, but Winder decided that Vincent&#x27;s forces were too strong to engage, and halted at the Forty Mile Creek. Another brigade joined him, commanded by Brigadier General John Chandler, who was the senior, and took overall command. Their combined force, numbering 3,400, advanced to Stoney Creek, where they encamped on 5 June. The two generals set up their headquarters at the Gage Farm.

Vincent sent his deputy assistant adjutant general, Lieutenant Colonel John Harvey, to reconnoitre the American position. Harvey recommended a night attack, reporting that &quot;the enemy&#x27;s guards were few and negligent; his line of encampment was long and broken; his artillery was feebly supported; several of his corps were placed too far to the rear to aid in repelling a blow which might be rapidly struck in front&quot;. The American dispositions described by Harvey account for the statement in the post-battle report of the U.S. Assistant Adjutant-General that only 1,328 American troops were engaged against the British, out of Chandler&#x27;s total force of 3,400. A British column of five companies from the 1/8th (King&#x27;s) Regiment of Foot and the main body of the 49th Regiment of Foot, about 700 men in all, was formed. Out of the 700 soldiers fighting on the British side, 14 were Canadian locals and the remainder were British regulars. Although Vincent accompanied the column, he placed Harvey in command.
At this point, the story of Billy Green comes to light. Green was a 19-year-old local resident who had witnessed the advance of the Americans from the top of the Niagara Escarpment earlier in the day. Green&#x27;s brother-in-law, Isaac Corman, had been briefly captured by the Americans, but was released after he convinced them (truthfully) that he was the cousin of American general William Henry Harrison. In order to be able to pass through the American lines, he was given the challenge response password for the day – &quot;Wil-Hen-Har&quot; (an abbreviation of Harrison&#x27;s name). He gave his word of honour that he would not divulge this to the British army. He then revealed the word to Green, who rode his brother-in-law&#x27;s horse part way, and ran on foot the rest of the way to Burlington Heights. Here, he revealed the password to Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. He was provided with a sword and uniform and used his knowledge of the terrain to guide the British to the American position. Green was present at the battle.

However, it has been suggested that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making grand rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry&#x27;s ear as if to whisper the countersign. But with bayonet secreted in hand, he grabbed the surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet at his throat, the sentry gave up the password. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877 and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of &quot;The Canadian Literary Journal&quot;. Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as &quot;the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger.&quot; His name was Vincent and he did not wander about the woods for days. Snider&#x27;s source for the provenance of the countersign should thus be considered to be unreliable.

==Battle==

The British left their camp at Burlington Heights at 11:30 p.m. on 5 June. While Vincent was the senior officer present, the troops were placed under the conduct and direction of Lieutenant Colonel Harvey, who led them silently toward Stoney Creek. They had removed the flints from their muskets to ensure that there were no accidental discharges and dared not utter even a whisper. A sentry post of American soldiers was surprised and either captured or killed by bayonet. Green is said to have bayoneted one of the American sentries personally, although this is not mentioned in any official British record. The British continued advancing toward the American campfires in silence. However at the repeated urging of Second Lieutenant Ephraim Shaler, the U.S. 25th Regiment which had earlier been camped there had been moved from their previous exposed position, leaving behind only the cooks who were preparing the troops&#x27; meal for the next day. Shaler had returned to the original position when he heard a sentry cry out as he was being tomahawked after being shot with an arrow from one of John Norton&#x27;s small band of First Nations warriors.

Around the same time, a group of Vincent&#x27;s staff officers who had come forward to watch the action let out a cheer. Their men took up the cheer, relieving their tension but depriving them of the element of surprise that was their primary advantage given the lopsided number of troops they faced. Instead of striking fear in their adversaries, the yells served to direct their attention to where the British were, helping the rousing troops to focus their attention and musket fire and making it nearly impossible for officers&#x27; orders to be heard above the din. Any hope of catching the Americans unaware and bayoneting them in their sleep was now lost and the British fixed their flints to their muskets and attacked. Lieutenant James Fitzgibbon and three sergeants of the Light Company of the 49th were able to keep their men from taking up the shout &quot;until a late stage of the affair, when firing on our side became general&quot;. Gradually, the American troops began to recover from the initial surprise, recover their poise and start firing at the attacking British, at times from as far away as . The American artillery also entered the fray after having previously been rendered useless due to the dampness settling into the powder.

Holding the high ground, the Americans were able to pour both musket and artillery fire into the exposed British line and the line began to lose cohesion. For ammunition, the U.S. 25th Infantry was firing a variant of &quot;buck and ball&quot;, in this instance firing 12 buckshot balls instead of the usual .65 calibre ball and 3 buckshot. This effectively turned their muskets into shotguns. Despite repeated charges by the British, the centre of the American line was holding and with the withering fire that the British line was sustaining, it was only a matter of time before they would have to retire.

A series of events coincided to change the course of the battle. General Winder ordered the U.S. 5th Infantry to protect the left flank. In doing so, he created a gap in the American line while at the same time leaving the artillery unsupported by infantry. Simultaneously, the other American commander, John Chandler, hearing musket shots from the far right of the American line and having already sent his staff officers off with other orders, rode out to investigate personally. But his horse fell (or was shot – Chandler used both excuses at different times) and he was knocked out in the fall.

Major Charles Plenderleath, commanding the British 49th Regiment, was able to ascertain the position of the American artillery when two field guns fired in quick succession (). Realising the importance of possession of the guns, he gathered troops of Fitzgibbon&#x27;s and other nearby companies to charge the guns before they could reload. First to volunteer for what could be a suicidal attack were 23-year-old sergeant Alexander Fraser and his 21-year-old brother Peter, a corporal in Fitzgibbon&#x27;s company, with 20 to 30 others. With bayonets fixed, Plenderleath led the charge up Gage&#x27;s Lane, volunteers following at a run, all fearing that the next discharge from the cannons might annihilate them. However, the U.S. 2nd Artillery under the command of Captain Nathaniel Towson at that moment responded to an order to cease firing, unaware of the British troops advancing on their position. The gunners were without arms of their own. The British charged the field guns, and when they were within a few yards of the gun emplacement, the men began yelling &quot;Come on, Brant&quot;. They set upon the helpless gunners, bayoneting man and horse, quickly overrunning and capturing the position before continuing on to engage the U.S. 23rd Infantry which got off one round before the momentum of the 49th scattered them. The remaining British forces followed soon after.

At this point General Chandler, conscious again and aware of the commotion near his artillery but not of the reason, stumbled to the position to investigate. Thinking himself to be among the U.S. 23rd Infantry and intending to bring order back to the &quot;new and undisciplined&quot; troops, he realised to his horror that the soldiers were British and Alexander Fraser immediately took him prisoner at bayonet point. Winder very shortly thereafter fell prey to the same mistake. Realising his error, he pulled his pistol, aiming it at Fraser who was poised to take him prisoner as he had Chandler. With his musket pointed at Winder&#x27;s breast, Fraser told him menacingly &quot;If you stir, sir; you die&quot; and Winder was made prisoner also, proffering his sword to Fraser. Major Joseph Lee Smith of the 25th U.S. Infantry was very nearly captured himself but having made good his escape, alerted his men to make a quick withdrawal, thereby avoiding capture. Command of the American forces fell to cavalry officer Colonel James Burn. The cavalry charged forward firing, but once again in the darkness, the Americans suffered from a case of mistaken identity – they were firing on their own U.S. 16th Infantry, who were themselves wandering around without their commander and firing at each other in confusion. Shortly afterwards, the Americans fell back, convinced that they had been defeated, when in fact they still retained a superior force.

The battle lasted less than 45 minutes, but its intensity led to heavy casualties on both sides. As dawn broke, Harvey ordered the outnumbered British to fall back into the woods in order to hide their small numbers. They succeeded in carrying away two of the captured guns, and spiked two more, leaving them on the ground owing to their inability to move them. They later watched from a distance as the Americans returned to their camp after daybreak, burned their provisions and tents and retreated toward Forty Mile Creek (present day Grimsby, Ontario). By the afternoon of 6 June, the British occupied the former site of the American camp.

For much of the morning of 6 June, General Vincent was missing. He had been injured after a fall from his horse during the battle and was found wandering in a state of confusion, convinced that the entire British force had been destroyed. He was finally located about seven miles from the battle scene; his horse, hat and sword all missing.

==Casualties==
The British casualty return gave 23 killed, 136 wounded and 55 missing, of whom 52 were captured by the Americans.

The American casualty return for 6 June gave 17 killed, 38 wounded, and 7 officers (2 brigadier-generals, 1 major, 3 captains and 1 lieutenant) and 93 enlisted men missing. The British report of prisoners taken on the morning of 6 June corresponds exactly to the American list of &quot;missing&quot; as concerns the number and ranks of the captured officers but gives 94 enlisted men captured, indicating that one of the Americans who was presumed to have been killed in the casualty return was in fact captured. Of the seven officers who were captured on the morning of 6 June, three (General Chandler, Captain Peter Mills and Captain George Steele) were wounded, which suggests that a substantial number of the enlisted prisoners may also have been wounded.

British killed in action at the Battle of Stoney Creek, 6 June 1813 (as listed on the Stoney Creek Battlefield Monument):
Samuel Hooker, Joseph Hunt, James Daig, Thomas Fearnsides, Richard Hugill, George Longley, Laurence Mead, John Regler, John Wale, Charles Page, James Adams, Alexander Brown, Michael Burke, Henry Carroll, Nathaniel Catlin, Martin Curley, Martin Donnolly, Peter Henley, John Hostler, Edward Killoran, Edward Little, Patrick Martin, John Maxwell.
The names of the American dead are not recorded.

==Aftermath==

Casualties in the fight had been uneven, with the British taking roughly three times more killed and wounded than the Americans, but the Americans had been shaken. It is most probable that if their generals had not been captured, the battle might have turned out quite differently. However, the British had a reasonable claim to victory in this battle. Under the de facto leadership of Colonel Harvey, and with some good fortune, they had successfully forced the Americans back toward the Niagara River. American forces would never again advance so far from the Niagara.

At Forty Mile Creek, the retreating American troops were met by reinforcements under Dearborn&#x27;s second-in-command, Major General Morgan Lewis. Dearborn had ordered Lewis to proceed to Stoney Creek to attack the British, but almost as the two groups met, the British fleet under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo appeared in Lake Ontario. The American armed vessels under Commodore Isaac Chauncey had abruptly vanished when they heard that Yeo and troops under Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost had attacked their own base at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor, New York. (The Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor was a defeat for the British, but large quantities of stores and equipment had mistakenly been set on fire by the Americans, hampering the Americans&#x27; efforts to build large fighting vessels.)

With Yeo threatening his communications, which ran for along the edge of the lake, Lewis decided to retreat at once to Fort George, leaving a large quantity of tents, arms and supplies for the British to acquire. The British vigorously followed up the American withdrawal. A skirmish on 7 June brought in 12 more prisoners; a captain and 11 enlisted men. During 8–10 June 80 more prisoners were taken, making a total American loss, during 6–10 June, of 16 killed, 38 wounded and 192 captured: total 230 men.

The Americans retired into a small defensive perimeter around Fort George, where they remained until abandoning the fort and retreating across the Niagara River into U.S. territory in December.

Brigadier General Winder was later exchanged and subsequently commanded the Tenth Military District around Washington, where he attracted censure following the burning of Washington.

==Legacy==

Battlefield House remains from the time of the battle, and is a museum located within Battlefield Park. They are located very near the site of the battle and, with a knoll across the street where a separate monument stands, comprises Battle of Stoney Creek National Historic Site. The park&#x27;s stone tower, was dedicated exactly 100 years after the battle. It was unveiled following a signal given by Queen Mary in England, via the transatlantic telegraph cable, and commemorates British soldiers who died in the fight. The Gage farm house is also preserved and serves as a museum. The battle is re-enacted annually on the weekend closest to 6 June. The 2016 event was the 35th such re-enactment.

The battle is commemorated in the song &quot;Billy Green&quot; from the 1999 album &quot;From Coffee House to Concert Hall&quot; by Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers. George Fox also sang &quot;Billy Green&quot; which is on his album, &quot;Canadian&quot;.

<doc id="707460" wikidata="Q1044496" url="?curid=707460" title="Live Evil (Black Sabbath album)">
<text>Live Evil is the first official live album by English rock band Black Sabbath. The previously released &quot;Live at Last&quot; (1980) was not sanctioned by the band. &quot;Live Evil&quot; peaked at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart.

==Recording==
In early 1982, Black Sabbath&#x27;s publishing deal with their previous management expired. By re-recording several songs from their earlier catalog and releasing them as a live album, all the songwriters stood to see a hefty profit from the publishing royalties. The liner notes state that the album was recorded in Seattle, San Antonio and Dallas during the 1982 tour in support of the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; album, but doesn&#x27;t give specific information on which songs were performed in which location.

In his autobiography &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven &amp; Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that the band&#x27;s live show during this period featured &quot;lots of pyro with fire and bombs&quot; and that while playing the Hammersmith Odeon the bombs had been tested and &quot;blew a two-foot-wide hole in the floor on my side. If I&#x27;d been there, I would have been blown up. Christ, it was dangerous.&quot; Iommi also admits that the band had to cancel a show at Madison Square Garden when the bombs blew out the tubes in all the amps during the first note of the first song &quot;War Pigs&quot;. In the liner notes to the 2008 retrospective &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot;, vocalist Ronnie James Dio remembers, &quot;It was an excellent tour. I think we were probably riding quite high on the &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; success, and so we ended up playing really, really well. Even towards the end the shows were still great.&quot; Tension, however, had been building for some time between the band members, with rock journalist Steffan Chirazi observing in 2008 that the story behind the creation of &quot;Live Evil&quot; is one of &quot;quiet yet savagely visceral turmoil and a band collapsing under their weight of silence, unspoken accusation, and an unforgiving schedule.&quot;

Of the oddly distant crowd sound, Iommi remarked: &quot;We forgot about the audience!&quot; In the same interview, asked to choose &quot;a track that the engineer didn&#x27;t cock up&quot;, he said: &quot;I liked &#x27;Heaven and Hell&#x27; flowing into &#x27;Sign of the Southern Cross&#x27;. It had its moments, that one.&quot;

==Breakup==
During the mixing of &quot;Live Evil&quot;, Dio and drummer Vinny Appice abruptly left the group, leaving original members Iommi and Geezer Butler to carry on. The two factions would provide vastly different accounts of what transpired as things fell apart.

&quot;Ronnie had started to take over a little bit too much and was becoming a bit of a Hitler,&quot; Iommi explained to Steve Gett of &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot;. &quot;We were working on the &quot;Live Evil&quot; record in Los Angeles, and in fact we nicknamed him &#x27;Little Hitler.&#x27;&quot; In his 2011 memoir, Iommi was considerably less harsh in his summation of Dio&#x27;s behaviour, stating &quot;By then Ronnie did come over a little more...I suppose, bossy. The way he conducted himself, the way he talked, it might have given that impression to the outside world, but he usually didn&#x27;t mean anything by it. Ronnie was just very outspoken.&quot; Iommi also contends that he and bassist Geezer Butler were concerned about Dio already rehearsing with other musicians for a proposed solo album offered to him by Warner Brothers Records.
Dio&#x27;s account attributed the breakup to a misunderstanding arising as the result of Iommi&#x27;s drug abuse. Dio has stated that while he and Appice were not interested in drugs, Iommi and Butler were using cocaine very heavily at that time. When Dio and Appice arrived at the studio to begin the &quot;Live Evil&quot; mixing process, Iommi and Butler never showed up. While waiting for their bandmates at the studio over a period of several days, Dio and Appice passed the time by listening to the recordings and frequently experimented with the mix by asking the engineer to adjust the levels of various parts. No mixing had commenced, and the tracks were merely being listened to. When Iommi arrived days later, he asked the engineer what Dio had been doing in his absence and was told that he had frequently requested that the vocals be brought up higher in the mix. Iommi, in his drug-addled state, misunderstood what he was being told and came to the conclusion that Dio was not only mixing the album without him, but was trying to push his own vocals much too prominently in the mix. Iommi, a founding member of the band, reckoned he had a power struggle on his hands and he wasn&#x27;t about to relinquish creative control of Black Sabbath. Dio steadfastly denied that he altered the mix and accused Iommi and Butler of fabricating the story. Iommi later laid the blame on the engineer. On the &quot;Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven and Hell&quot; DVD, both Dio and Appice claim the mixing sessions were scheduled to start in the early afternoon but, on the third day, Iommi and Butler didn&#x27;t show up until much later. This exacerbated the rift between the new and original members until the singer was asked to leave. In the same interview series, Butler described the &quot;Live Evil&quot; mixing sessions as &quot;the Yanks against the Brits,&quot; adding, &quot;I think Ronnie seemed to desperately want to do his own stuff and we sort of wanted to keep it going as it was.&quot; In the liner notes to &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot;, Appice states, &quot;I knew things were coming to a close from some of the things that were happening on the road. Ronnie and I would ride in one car, Geezer and Tony in another car, and everybody was breaking away from each other a little bit.&quot;

==Release==

Iommi has said that the decision to release &quot;Live Evil&quot; was prompted by two factors. The first was the 1980 release of the unsanctioned &quot;Live at Last&quot; album, and the second was former lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 1982 release of a live album consisting entirely of Black Sabbath songs. In his autobiography, Iommi confesses that he was &quot;unpleasantly surprised&quot; that Osbourne had included only Sabbath songs and speculates &quot;I think putting out the live album like that was down to Sharon (Osbourne, Ozzy&#x27;s wife and manager), trying to put the cat among the pigeons.&quot; At the time, Sharon was severely at odds with her father Don Arden, who was managing Sabbath and was attempting to steer Osbourne away from his deal with Arden&#x27;s label, Jet, and on to a new deal with Jet&#x27;s distribution company, CBS. &quot;We had to give the old man two albums, well, a live album counted as two,&quot; she is quoted as saying in Mick Wall&#x27;s 2013 biography on the band. &quot;I knew he&#x27;d go for it because it wouldn&#x27;t cost anything to make...But Don was expecting something with Randy (Rhoads) on it and I just thought fuck that. I&#x27;m not giving him that. He can have something with a load of old Sabbath shit on it.&quot;

&quot;Live Evil&quot; hit both the UK Top 30 and the US Top 40 Album charts. AllMusic states that &quot;&quot;Live Evil&quot; does benefit from a crystal clear, in-your-face sound, and by showcasing even amounts of both Ozzy and Dio material, effectively documents Black Sabbath&#x27;s renascent tours of the early &#x27;80s. Ronnie certainly has the vocal chops, if not the same everyman charm, to handle the Osbourne classics, but his incessant banter between (and during!) songs sometimes verges on the unbearable.&quot; The album is included in the Black Sabbath box set &quot;The Rules of Hell&quot;. The &quot;Live Evil&quot; album cover features literal interpretations of Sabbath songs.

On 12 April, 2023, Iommi, Butler, and Dio&#x27;s official social media accounts across several sites, as well as the Rhino website, announced the reissue of &quot;Live Evil&quot; as a Super Deluxe box set on 2 June, 2023 (19 May in the U.S.). It included the original album remastered and a remix of the album from the original analogue master tapes by longtime band associate Wyn Davis across four compact discs and four LPs. The physical versions also come with an illustrated hardback book that include new liner notes and replicas of the concert book and poster from the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; tour.

== Track listing ==


*The UK cassette release had, as its first side, sides 1 and 3 of the vinyl release, with side two of the cassette being vinyl sides 2 and 4. It seems this was not a mistake, rather a money-saving exercise, since the running-times of the two sides of the tape were more-or-less equal in this configuration. 
*The US cassette release has, as its first side, sides 1 and almost all of 2 except for &quot;Iron Man&quot; which fades out at end of Side 1. Then the second side began with &quot;Iron Man&quot; (via fade in) and sides 3 and 4 were intact. This was done to make the sides of the cassette of nearly equal length.
*The first UK CD release omitted &quot;War Pigs&quot; (or &quot;Warpigs&quot; as it was titled in the explanation for its cutting, printed on the rear of the tray-insert), so as to fit onto a single CD. The 1996 UK remaster restored this track but cut much of the stage banter, so as to again fit onto a single CD: this reduced the &#x27;live&#x27; feel of the recordings.
*In the US Warner Brothers released a 2-CD set, which matched the running order of the vinyl. Each of these WB CDs came in its own jewel case, complete with artwork, rather than a 2CD jewel case.
*Universal Music Corporation released a &quot;deluxe edition&quot; worldwide in 2010 which contained the entire album in its original running order.

<doc id="707480" wikidata="Q7381747" url="?curid=707480" title="Russell Road (Ontario)">
<text>Russell Road is an arterial road in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It begins in Ottawa in the Riverview neighbourhood and runs eastward through the rural communities of Ramsayville, Carlsbad Springs and Bearbrook in Ottawa and through the Municipality of Clarence-Rockland, connecting the communities of Cheney and Bourget, ending at Boundary Road on the eastern border of Clarence Rockland. In Ottawa it is officially Ottawa Road #26, and in Clarence-Rockland as United Counties of Prescott and Russell County Road #2.

==History==
The road was originally built in the 1830s from parts of an indigenous trail that led to Montreal. In the 19th century, it was also known as the &quot;Ottawa and Russell macadamized road&quot;. and was owned by the Ottawa and Russell Macadamized Road Company. It would later be owned by the Ottawa, Montreal &amp; Russell Road Company. The Carleton County 1879 Atlas shows the road running from the village of Janeville (now Vanier), southward following the east bank of the Rideau River toward Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge, then eastward following what is now Terminal Avenue, then turning south to connect more or less to its current alignment.

In about 1952, following the area&#x27;s annexation into Ottawa, Russell Road from Janeville (at this time called Eastview) to Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge would be renamed Riverside Drive (now River Road North). In 1960, the part of Russell Road from Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge to the &quot;westerly limit of the NCC subdivision&quot; was renamed &quot;Terminal Avenue&quot;. By the 1960s, the city of Ottawa deemed Russell Road as a &quot;public highway&quot;, and plans were put in place to truncate the road to alleviate traffic. A by-law was passed in 1961 promising to close the road north of Industrial Avenue as soon as Industrial was extended to St. Laurent Boulevard. It was first truncated at Belfast Road in 1965, and then in 1979, it was temporarily truncated at Industrial, despite protestations from residents who used the road as a shortcut. This section was finally closed in 1980. The intersection of Russell Road with Smyth Road and St. Laurent Boulevard was realigned in 1976. Further east, following the completion of Highway 417 through Ramsayville in the mid-1970s, Russell Road was bifurcated by the highway. The bifurcation meant that Russell Road would be diverted to end at Baseline Road (now Ramsayville Road), south of the highway, and begin again north of the highway, with a bridge taking traffic under the new highway. Russell Road faced its final realignment in the mid-1990s when Hawthorne Road was extended north to the intersection of Russell and Walkley Road. The part of Russell Road south of Walkely was thus diverted to a new intersection with Hawthorne.

These intersection modifications have cut the road into 4 parts. To sum, Russell Road now begins at Industrial Avenue on the outskirts of the Riverview neighbourhood and runs southeast before ending at Smyth Road. The road begins again near the Elmvale Shopping Centre, from St. Laurent Boulevard, and runs south until it turns into Hawthorne Road. To keep going on Russell, one must make a left turn. This part of Russell Road continues to the community of Ramsayville, where the road then ends at Ramsayville Road. To keep going on Russell Road, one must take a left on Ramsayville Road, cross Highway 417 then turn right. At this point, Russell Road continues east through the communities of Carlsbad Springs, Bearbrook before leaving the city of Ottawa. It then passes through the communities of Cheney and Bourget in the City of Clarence-Rockland.

Russell Road was named because it was used by travellers, before the construction of Highway 417 as the route to get to Russell, Ontario from both Ottawa in the west and Bourget in the east. Russell Road for the majority of its length passes through rural surroundings. Russell, Ontario is named after Peter Russell, a government official and slave trader in Upper Canada.

==Route description==
The segment of Russell Road from Industrial to Smyth is a 1.3 km two-lane collector street that cuts through the eastern edge of the Riverview neighbourhood. Addresses on this segment begin at 1636 Russell in the north and 1929 in the south. Generally, the west side of the street is home to post-World War II housing, while the east side is commercial, though there are homes on the east side closer to Smyth. Among this section&#x27;s amenities are the Perley and Rideau Veteran&#x27;s Health Centre (1720–1780), Russell Heights Ottawa Community Housing public housing (1761–1803), Russell Smyth Heights apartments (1825), Russell Manor Ottawa Community Housing (1909) and Smyth Medical Centre (1929). 

The second segment of Russell Road begins about 370 m southeast of terminus of the first segment. In this gap, there remains one building with a Russell address at 1990, a strip mall at the corner of Smyth and St. Laurent. The second segment of Russell does not begin until further southeast, at an intersection with St. Laurent Boulevard where St. Laurent turns into Russell, while St. Laurent begins a new segment at the intersection. It ends at a similar intersection with Hawthorne Road, where the road continues southward on Hawthorne, and a new segment of Russell begins. This segment is about 1.8 km long, and separates the neighbourhoods of Hawthorne Meadows on the west and Sheffield Glen on the east. The segment&#x27;s addresses begin at 2080 and end at 2400. 2080 Russell is another public housing project known as Russell Gardens. Other amenities in this segment include Hawthorne United Church (2244) and a fourth public housing project, Confederation Court (2282). Between St. Laurent and Walkley, Russell is mostly a two-lane road. In addition to the housing projects, there are also ordinary dwellings on the west side of the street built around 1970. The short segment between Walkley and Hawthorne is a 4-lane divided arterial road.

The third segment of Russell begins at Hawthorne and ends at Ramsayville Road, and runs for 3.7 km. It is mostly rural in character, beginning at the suburban edge of the city, and heads southeast into the countryside. Addresses for this segment begin at 2434 and end at 4397. Amenities include the William E. Hay Centre, a youth detention centre (2464), St. George&#x27;s Hawthorne Cemetery (3970) and Ramsayville Cemetery. Russell is two-lane arterial road in this segment. While mostly rural, there are a few industrial establishments north of Hunt Club.

The fourth segment of Russell begins 730m north of where the third segment ended on Ramsayville Road in the community of Ramsayville. This section is signed as Ottawa Road #26. Addresses on this segment begin at 4610. The road runs for 5 km eastward before merging with Leitrim Road. The road then runs another 1.5 km before splitting from Leitrim again at the northern edge of the community of Carlsbad Springs. Close to the bridge over Bear Brook, there is an historical plaque on the side of Russell detailing the history of the community. From Leitrim Rd, it&#x27;s 2.9 km to the centre of Carlsbad Springs at Boundary Road. Russell Road then travels 10.3 km eastward until the community of Bearbrook at the intersection with Dunning Road. Bearbrook is home to the Bearbrook Community Hall at 8720 Russell and the Trinity Anglican Church Bearbrook (8785). From Bearbrook, the road travels 5.4 km eastward until the Ottawa city limits at Canaan Road, where it enters the city of Clarence-Rockland as Country Road 2. The last address on Russell in the city of Ottawa is 9999.

Upon entering Clarence-Rockland, addresses re-start at 102. 2.2 km east of the border is the community of Cheney, where Russell intersects with Drouin Road. Russell Road then travels 5.9 km to Marcil Road where it turns into Laval Street in Bourget. Along the way, it passes St. Francis Xavier Catholic High School at 1235 Russell. Russell Road begins again after 2.6 km as Laval Street, when it intersections with Labelle Road/Schnupp Road. It then travels 4 km east until the border with Alfred and Plantagenet when it becomes Boudreau Road.

<text>The Rapture was an American rock band from New York City, formed in 1998. During their reunion, the band consisted of Luke Jenner (lead vocals, guitar), Vito Roccoforte (drums, percussion), and Gabriel Andruzzi (keyboards, bass, saxophone, percussion). The classic lineup (1999–2009) added Mattie Safer playing bass and sharing lead vocal duties with Jenner. Safer and Jenner&#x27;s harmonized choruses became part of the signature sound of the band, featuring on several of the band’s more well known songs.

The band mixed influences from many genres including dance-punk, post-punk, acid house, disco, and electronica. They were forerunners of the post-punk revival during the early 2000s, as they mixed their early post-punk sound with electronic and dance elements. The band has acknowledged that their music draws on themes of Christianity.

The band began by releasing a mini-album, &quot;Mirror&quot;, in January 1999, under Gravity Records. Afterward, in 2001, the band signed to Sub Pop and released the EP &quot;Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks&quot;. The band released the song &quot;House of Jealous Lovers&quot; in 2002 under their new record label DFA Records. After a re-release of the song, it peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart in 2003 and received critical acclaim. Later that year, the band released their first full-length studio album, &quot;Echoes.&quot; The band released their second studio album, &quot;Pieces of the People We Love&quot;, in 2006 under Universal Records and Vertigo Records, featuring production from Danger Mouse, Paul Epworth, and Ewan Pearson.

The band entered a small hiatus in 2008 after band member Luke Jenner left the band, but he eventually returned to the band after 8 months. Mattie Safer, the band&#x27;s long time bassist and vocalist, also left the band permanently in 2009. After a re-signing to DFA Records, the band released their third studio album, &quot;In the Grace of Your Love&quot;, in September 2011, which was their first studio album in five years. In 2014, it was revealed that the Rapture had disbanded, though no official statement had been made. The band later reunited in 2019 without Safer.

==History==

===Formation, &quot;Mirror&quot; and &quot;Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks&quot; (1998–2002)===

In 1998, drummer Vito Roccoforte and guitarist/vocalist Luke Jenner formed the Rapture. They were childhood friends from a San Diego suburb who started playing music together, and when Roccoforte moved to San Francisco for college, Jenner followed him and they started playing more, which would lead to forming the Rapture. Roccoforte was an aspiring filmmaker, but became a drummer at Jenner&#x27;s insistence. According to Jenner in 2018, &quot;In college, he got really good grades and had all of these ambitions to be a filmmaker. I kind of railroaded him into the Rapture. He didn’t really want to be a drummer, but I needed somebody I could trust who was never going to leave my side. And he agreed; it’s not like I forced him into it. I asked him humbly and he accepted.&quot; They released a single, &quot;The Chair That Squeaks&quot;, on Hymnal Sound that same year. After heavy touring, they released a debut mini-album, &quot;Mirror&quot;, on Gravity Records in 1999.

After having his house burned down by drug dealers, their bass player suggested they move to Seattle because he had better music contacts there. In five months between January and May &#x27;99, the band spent more time getting drunk than writing songs, but they did manage to get a record deal from Sub Pop.

After releasing &quot;Mirror&quot;, they decided it would be best to move to New York, where they slept in a van that they had bought with money from the label. It was in New York that bassist and vocalist Mattie Safer, a freshman studying jazz at NYU joined the band. He had met them the previous summer when they were touring through Washington DC. He joined the band in the fall of 1999, prior to the 2001 release of the six-song EP &quot;Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks&quot; on Sub Pop. The addition of Safer proved to pivotal for the band, according to Jenner. In 2006 he said, &quot;There were five people in the band before Matt in the space of just over a year. He was the first person that was actually good. He was musically way better than us and brought a lot of stability. Listening to him for the first time made me think that I actually had better learn to play my own instrument.&quot;

Living in New York also made Jenner aware of the possibilities offered by dance music. In 2011 he said, &quot;Coming to NY and going to proper dance music clubs, that was pivotal. I was hearing dance music over a big system and realizing it has the same energy as a hardcore show, the idea that a kick drum can be so powerful, so tough-sounding in a song like &#x27;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&#x27; by Michael Jackson on the right system. I think also, just the raw power of dancing, and the kind of communal aspect that could be created, like the same thing that sprouts up around punk rock kids, it could be the same with dance music.&quot;

===&quot;House of Jealous Lovers&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; (2002–06)===

With the help of the DFA production team, the band released &quot;House of Jealous Lovers&quot; in 2002 and eventually released their first full-length album &quot;Echoes&quot;. The album secured two Top 40 singles in the UK and also was met with critical acclaim, being awarded Album of the Year by pitchforkmedia.com and runner up in NME only to the White Stripes. Multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Andruzzi, who is also Safer&#x27;s cousin, joined the band full-time after the record was completed to help tour. In the wake of the success of &quot;House of Jealous Lovers&quot;, The Rapture opened for the Sex Pistols in a football stadium in England, and underwent a large major bidding war eventually signing with Vertigo Records out of the UK and Strummer Records (a Gary Gersh Label) both owned by Universal Music. In January 2004, the Rapture toured with Franz Ferdinand on the NME Awards Tour. Later that year, the band toured on the main stage of the Curiosa Festival alongside Interpol, Mogwai, and The Cure. The album&#x27;s main song, &quot;Echoes&quot;, was used as opening for the British series Misfits.

===&quot;Pieces of the People We Love&quot; (2006–11)===
The Rapture released their second full-length album, &quot;Pieces of the People We Love&quot;, on Universal Motown Records in September 2006 after Strummer folded. Paul Epworth, Ewan Pearson and Danger Mouse produced the album. Recorded mostly in New York city at Sear Sound (studio of Walter Sear, partner of Bob Moog) but also recorded a few songs in Los Angeles to work with Danger Mouse. The bulk of the recording being handled by Epworth and Pearson. The title track features Cee Lo Green on backing vocals. The Rapture also toured with Daft Punk on the North American leg of their tour in 2007, playing such venues as Red Rocks in Colorado, and the Greek Theatre in Berkeley California.

In an interview with Dave Owen of Access All Areas and I Can&#x27;t Breathe Media, Luke Jenner stated that Justin Timberlake originally sang on the track &quot;No Sex For Ben&quot; that the band recorded for 2008&#x27;s &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; video game soundtrack: &quot;We were recording with Timbaland, &#x27;cause he beatboxes on the track and Justin was upstairs with Duran Duran and he came down and sang [backing vocals] on the track [with Safer on lead vocals], but when we got it back from the label someone had removed JT&#x27;s vocals.&quot; The song was a hit, with Jenner stating in 2011, &quot;That song kept us alive for five years. In the interim we played Australia once a year for five years because that song was a big hit there. Ordinary people know it. Australia is where I lived out all my 14 year-old rock star dreams.&quot; In contrast, Vito Roccoforte stated his dissatisfaction with the song by saying, &quot;It just didn’t make any fucking sense to me because it was the total antithesis of what I felt musically I wanted to do or what we should be doing.&quot;

In 2008, Luke Jenner left the band in the wake of his mother&#x27;s death and son&#x27;s birth. After a few months he returned to the band. On July 14, 2009, Gabriel Andruzzi announced via The Rapture&#x27;s official website that Mattie Safer had left the band in April and added that the remaining members had been working on new material since Safer&#x27;s departure in their Brooklyn studio. In the days following Safer&#x27;s departure Dave Owen caught up with Luke Jenner who said that the split was amicable. After leaving The Rapture, Mattie Safer spent a year and a half working on new music, then sending it out to various friends including Paul Epworth, who encouraged Safer to &quot;stop worrying about trying to be cool.&quot; Expressing interest in Safer&#x27;s R&amp;B-influenced music, in 2011 Epworth signed him to the new label he was starting, Wolf Tone. Though Safer managed to record an EP, ultimately he and Wolf Tone decided to part ways, and in 2016 he finally released the EP &quot;All We Are&quot;. In 2011, Safer also appeared as a guest vocalist on &quot;Someone Just Like You&quot; from &quot;House of Beni&quot;, the debut album by Australian producer Beni. In August 2011, The Rapture first appeared on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 75th issue.

===&quot;In the Grace of Your Love&quot; and split (2011–14)===

The Rapture released &quot;In The Grace of Your Love&quot; on DFA Records on September 6, 2011, in the U.S. and September 5 in Europe while Modular released the album in Australia and New Zealand. Phoenix producer/Cassius member Philippe Zdar produced the record, which the Rapture recorded in Brooklyn and Paris.

In 2014, Red Bull Music Academy announced Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor, a concert in tribute to William Onyeabor led by David Byrne and featuring Jenner as one of the prominent musicians involved. In the press release, Jenner was listed as &quot;ex-The Rapture.&quot; Jonathan Galkin, manager of DFA Records, seemingly confirmed that the band had indeed broken up by saying, &quot;I kept thinking it might blow over, but that might not be the case. Feel free to go to press with this headline: &#x27;Did the Rapture Break Up and Not Tell Anyone?&#x27;&quot; In late 2014, Jenner asserted that while the band had never released an official statement about breaking up and that Galkin&#x27;s comments being picked up by the media had led to that assumption, there were issues that needed to be resolved before they could make new music again. He said, &quot;A band is a relationship — it’s a marriage or a close relationship. For me, my relationships with the band is more important than the band. If my relationship with Vito isn’t straight then there’s no point in trying to write and make music together. I can make music on my own, I don’t need to deal with Vito. But if we’re going to make music we’re going to have to talk about some stuff, and that has to come first.&quot;

After the band announced its reunion in 2019, Andruzzi provided some insight regarding the atmosphere during their last tour prior to their split:

===Post-split activity (2014–18)===

In June 2014, Vito Roccoforte and Gabriel Andruzzi released &quot;Moon Temple&quot;, their debut EP as Vito &amp; Druzzi. Moon Temple would also become the name of Andruzzi&#x27;s solo project, which released the two EPs &quot;Moon Temple I&quot; and &quot;Moon Temple II&quot; in 2016. Andruzzi and Roccoforte have also collaborated as Mother of Mars, releasing the single &quot;Seed 2 Sky&quot; in 2018.

Besides participating in Atomic Bomb! The Music of William Onyeabor, Luke Jenner learned production from Joakim Bouaziz, and was a guest vocalist on the latter&#x27;s track &quot;Bring Your Love&quot; from the 2014 album &quot;Tropics of Love&quot;.

In 2015, Roccoforte formed Body Music, a duo with DJ and producer Benjamin &quot;Bosq&quot; Woods of Whiskey Barons. They released their debut EP &quot;Just One&quot; in 2017.

In 2017, Jenner reiterated that he was still a member of The Rapture, and that whether or not the band would continue was up to Roccaforte. &quot;I would love to do the Rapture again, at this point it’s just up to Vito. He lives like a block away from here,&quot; he said. &quot;I still consider myself in the band. I have songs where I’m like, &#x27;This is a Rapture song.&#x27; I could make it for myself, but also it’s a Rapture song. My voice is so specific, it’s really easily identifiable. I’m sorta waiting on a phone call from Vito, saying, &#x27;Okay I’m ready to do stuff.&#x27;&quot;

That same year, Jenner released the &quot;Sunrise&quot; EP as Meditation Tunnel, The name Meditation Tunnel comes from a children&#x27;s toy and was chosen by Jenner for his solo project because Manfredi Romano a.k.a. DJ Tennis, who released the EP, forbade him to use his own name.

In 2018, Jenner started the band Seedy Films with three friends whose taste he admired but had never played music before. Explaining the idea behind the band, Jenner said, &quot;I really relate to how Brian Eno was more of a thinker than a musician. I mean, he makes some amazing music, but he has really great ideas. I have this idea that you can teach people techniques, but you can’t teach them taste. I’ve been in so many bands that had questionable taste and it always ends badly. Because saying you don’t like someone’s taste is like saying you don’t like someone’s face. You can’t change your taste, really; you can hone it, but you like what you like. So I had these three people I was already friends with who had really great taste, and I asked them if they wanted to play music. So I started teaching them and we put together this band. Writing songs is the easy part for me, so I taught them how to write songs and I play drums in the band because… why not? I’ve already done everything else. So that’s really fun.

In early 2018, Gabriel Andruzzi said, &quot;I’ve talked to Luke recently, but there is nothing specific in the works. Thus I cannot report anything one way or another regarding The Rapture. I remain optimistic, and I must say that I always love playing shows with that band.&quot;

Roccoforte also started playing shows with Wah Together, a new rock band which also consists of guitarist Steve Schiltz (Longwave, bassist Phil Mossman LCD Soundsystem and vocalist Jaiko Suzuki. On 5 September 2018, Annie Nightingale debuted some of their songs on her BBC Radio 1 show. Roccoforte and Safer also reunited as the rhythm section for the new live format of Poolside. Poolside co-founder Jeffrey Paradise said in a statement, &quot;Vito and Mattie are the backbone and rhythm section from one of my favorite bands ever: The Rapture. They’ve been big influences on my musical career over the years. It’s super inspiring to play together with such great people with amazing musical chemistry. The punch they add to the music is unmistakable.”

===Reunion (2019–2021)===
In February 2019, Jenner announced via Facebook that The Rapture would be reuniting. The band&#x27;s first show back is to be at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on April 30, followed by an appearance at the Just Like Heaven festival in Long Beach on May 4 alongside Phoenix, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and MGMT.

In a statement, Jenner explained the group&#x27;s reunion after over five years:

Both Roccoforte and Andruzzi confirmed their participation in the reunion via social media, as did Harris Klahr who would be resuming bass-playing duties for the band&#x27;s live shows that he had assumed after Safer&#x27;s departure. In response to a question on Twitter, Safer confirmed that he was not participating in the reunion. In a subsequent Instagram post, Safer stated that he &quot;would love the opportunity to get up and play those songs again, but I wasn&#x27;t asked,&quot; but that he was &quot;super psyched on [his] new band Safer, new label Cell Laboratories and playing Poolside.&quot;

The Rapture has been on an indefinite hiatus since their 2020 reunion shows were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, members have all pursued different projects. Luke Jenner is now a professional life coach, and in 2023, he stated that he was not in communication with his band mates and he is no longer recording music. 

All of The Rapture&#x27;s social media accounts have been inactive since 2021.

<doc id="707495" wikidata="Q3526078" url="?curid=707495" title="Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt">
<text>Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt is a fictional superhero character originally published by Charlton Comics.

==Publication history==
===Charlton Comics===
Created by Pete Morisi, the character debuted in &quot;Peter Cannon ... Thunderbolt&quot; #1 (Jan. 1966), part of Charlton editor Dick Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Action Heroes&quot; superhero line. The series then took over the numbering of the defunct title &quot;Son of Vulcan&quot;, and ran from issue #51 through #60 (March/April 1966 – November 1967), after which Pete Morisi, in addition to comic book work a New York City Police Department officer and time-pressed with police duties, left the title, which was canceled along with the rest of Charlton&#x27;s &quot;Action Heroes&quot; comics line.

There were several backup series in &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;. &quot;The Sentinels&quot;, by Gary Friedrich (writing his first superhero stories) and penciler-inker Sam Grainger, appeared in #54–59, and #60 had the Prankster, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil with art by Jim Aparo.

Morisi, who&#x27;d done work for Lev Gleason Publications in 1940s, reported in &quot;Comic Book Artist&quot; #9 (August 2000) that he had attempted to buy the rights to 1940s superhero Daredevil in the early 1960s. Gleason gave him his okay, but the character&#x27;s primary writer-artist, Charles Biro, balked, requesting a percentage of future profits. Morisi declined and went on to create Thunderbolt in a scaled-down version of that Daredevil&#x27;s symmetrically divided, red-and-blue costume.

===DC Comics===
After Charlton sold its superhero properties to DC in 1983, Thunderbolt reappeared after almost two decades in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover series (April 1985 – March 1986, Thunderbolt appearing in #6, 7, and 10) when he joined the heroes of the Multiverse in their crusade against the Anti-Monitor.

Introducing him into the new DC Universe, DC published &quot;Peter Cannon – Thunderbolt&quot;, by writer-penciler Mike Collins and inker Jose Marzan Jr. The series ran for 12 issues before cancellation (September 1992 – August 1993). During the series&#x27; short run, his recurring foils were the criminal terrorists-for-hire known as Scorpio. He later discovers that his girlfriend Cairo DeFrey was actually in charge of the organization.

The character also appeared briefly with the Justice League.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
Dynamite Entertainment published a ten issue series between September 2012 and July 2013. The series was co-written by Steve Darnall and Alex Ross, with art by Jonathan Lau.

The character later appeared in a new series published since February 2019, written by Kieron Gillen with art by Caspar Wijngaard, Mary Jo Safro and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou. In this series, it is revealed that Peter Cannon and Tabu were lovers.

A new series has been announced in July 2022.

==Fictional character biography==
His origin, as detailed in the original comic:
Peter Cannon, orphaned son of an American medical team, was raised in a Himalayan lamasery, where his parents had sacrificed their lives combating the dreaded Black Plague! After attaining the highest degree of mental and physical perfection, he was entrusted with the knowledge of the ancient scrolls that bore the secret writings of past generations of wise men! From them he learned concentration, mind over matter, the art of activating and then harnessing the unused portions of the brain, that made seemingly fantastic feats possible! Then he returned to America with his faithful friend, Tabu, and sought out a new life, in a new land, that required the emergence of Peter Cannon... Thunderbolt.

His costume is his training outfit from the lamasery, with an added mask. A recurring villain is the &quot;Hooded One&quot;, another monk from the lamasery who resented the fact an outsider like Peter was given access to the sacred scrolls.

<text>William Stanley Milligan (February 14, 1955 – December 12, 2014), also known as The Campus Rapist, was an American man who was the subject of a highly publicized court case in Ohio in the late 1970s. After having committed several felonies including armed robbery, he was arrested for three rapes on the campus of Ohio State University. In the course of preparing his defense, psychologists diagnosed Milligan with dissociative identity disorder. His lawyers pleaded insanity, claiming that two of his alternate personalities committed the crimes without Milligan being aware of it. He was the first person diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder to raise such a defense, and the first acquitted of a major crime for this reason, instead spending a decade in psychiatric hospitals.

Milligan&#x27;s life story was popularized by Daniel Keyes&#x27;s award-winning non-fiction book &quot;The Minds of Billy Milligan&quot;.

==Early life==

Milligan was born William Stanley Morrison on February 14, 1955, in Miami Beach, to Dorothy Pauline Sands and Johnny Morrison.

Dorothy grew up in Ohio farm country and lived in Lancaster with her first husband. They divorced, and Dorothy eventually moved to the Miami area, where she worked as a singer. There she began living with Johnny Morrison. Dorothy and Morrison had two other children: a son, Jim, born in October 1953, and a daughter, Kathy Jo, born in December 1956. 

Morrison struggled with fatherhood, and according to Daniel Keyes, &quot;Meeting the medical expenses overwhelmed Johnny. He borrowed more, gambled more, drank more... He was hospitalized for acute alcoholism and depression in ... 1958.&quot; In what appeared to be a suicide attempt, according to Keyes, &quot;Dorothy found him slumped over the table, half a bottle of Scotch and an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor.&quot; A few months after this attempt, on January 17, 1959, Johnny died by suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Dorothy took her children and moved away from Miami, eventually returning to Lancaster, Ohio. There, she remarried her ex-husband. This marriage lasted about a year. In 1962, she met Chalmer Milligan (1927–1988). Chalmer&#x27;s first wife Bernice divorced him on the &quot;grounds of gross neglect&quot;. He had a daughter, Challa, the same age as Billy, and another daughter who was a nurse. Dorothy and Chalmer married in Circleville, Ohio, on October 27, 1963, Chalmer had adopted Dorothy&#x27;s children and legally changed their surnames from &quot;Morrison&quot; to &quot;Milligan&quot;.

At his later trial, Chalmer was blamed for abusing Billy. Keyes claimed that Billy had multiple personalities from a much earlier age, however, with his first three (no-name boy, Christene, and Shawn) appearing by the time he was five years old.

==Arrest==

In 1975, Milligan was imprisoned at Lebanon Correctional Institution in Ohio for rape and armed robbery. He was released on parole in early 1977. In October 1977, Milligan was arrested for raping three women on the Ohio State University campus. He was identified by one of his victims from existing police mug shots of sex offenders, and from fingerprints lifted from another victim&#x27;s car.

Since he used a gun during the crime and guns were found in a search of his residence, he had violated his parole as well. He was indicted on &quot;three counts of [kidnapping], three counts of aggravated robbery and four counts of rape.&quot; He was placed in the Ohio State Penitentiary pending trial.

In the course of preparing his defense, he underwent a psychological examination by Dr. Willis C. Driscoll, who diagnosed Milligan with schizophrenia. He was then examined by psychologist Dorothy Turner of Southwest Community Mental Health Center in Columbus, Ohio. During this examination, Turner concluded that Milligan had dissociative identity disorder. Milligan&#x27;s public defenders, Gary Schweickart and Judy Stevenson, pleaded an insanity defense, and he was committed &quot;until such time as he regains sanity&quot;.

==Incarceration==
Milligan was sent to a series of state-run psychiatric hospitals, such as the Athens State Hospital, where, by his report, he received very little help. While he was in these hospitals, Milligan reported having ten different personalities. These ten were the only ones known to psychologists. Later on an additional 14 personalities, labeled &quot;The Undesirables&quot;, were claimed. Among the first ten were Arthur, a prim and proper Englishman who was an expert in science, medicine and hematology; Allen, a manipulator; Tommy, an escape artist and technophile; Ragen Vadascovinich, a Yugoslav communist who Milligan claimed had committed the robberies in a kind of Robin Hood spirit; and Adalana, a 19-year-old lesbian (shy, lonely and introverted) who cooked for all the personalities and craved affection, and who had allegedly committed the rapes.

Milligan received treatment from psychiatrist David Caul MD, who diagnosed the additional 14 personalities.

In 1986, Milligan had escaped the mental facility where he had been committed. During this time, he went by an alias (Christopher Carr) and might have been guilty of abducting his roommate and killing him, one of two murders of which Milligan is suspected.

==Release==
Milligan was released in 1988 after a decade in psychiatric hospitals. On August 1, 1991, he was discharged from the Ohio mental health system and the Ohio courts. In 1996, he lived in California where he owned Stormy Life Productions and was going to make a short film (which apparently was never made). His location, thereafter, remained for a long time unknown, his former acquaintances having lost contact with him. According to his sister, he had been living on her property in Ohio when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and lived with her for the remainder of his life. 

==Death==
Milligan died of cancer at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio, on December 12, 2014. He was 59.

==In media==
===Books===
Daniel Keyes authored a biographical non-fiction novel called &quot;The Minds of Billy Milligan&quot; (1981). His follow-up book, &quot;The Milligan Wars&quot;, was published in Japan in 1994, in Taiwan in 2000, in France in 2009, in Ukraine in 2018, but not in the United States, first owing to Milligan&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit against the State of Ohio for the allegedly inadequate treatment he received in Ohio facilities, then to the desire to tie its release to an in-development film.

===Film===
Several attempts had been made by Hollywood to adapt Keyes&#x27; book. In the early 1990s, James Cameron co-wrote a screenplay with Todd Graff for a film version he was to direct then-titled &quot;A Crowded Room&quot;. This adaptation never came into fruition because Cameron was sued by adaptation rightsholder Sandy Arcara, demanding &quot;her salary should be raised from $250,000 to $1.5 million&quot;; seeing the project stalled, Milligan also sued Cameron in 1993.

After Cameron left the project, Warner Bros. continued to develop the now slightly retitled &quot;The Crowded Room&quot;, with directors Joel Schumacher, David Fincher, Nick Cassavetes, F. Gary Gray, and Gus Van Sant attached at various points. Actors courted for the role of Milligan included Matthew McConaughey, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Billy Crudup, Sean Penn and John Cusack. In February 2015, it was confirmed that Leonardo DiCaprio would star as Milligan, and Jason Smilovic was set to pen the script.

The 2016 psychological horror film &quot;Split&quot; is loosely based on Milligan’s crimes due to his mental disorder. The film follows a man named Kevin Crumb, played by James McAvoy, who struggles with dissociative identity disorder (DID). Due to his disorder, he furtively captures and holds three teenage girls hostage in an underground isolation bunker.

Like Crumb in the film, Milligan also had 24 personalities.

===Television===
In 2021, it was announced that &quot;The Crowded Room&quot; would instead be adapted as a ten-episode television series on Apple TV+, starring Tom Holland, rather than the unrealized DiCaprio project.

In 2021, Netflix released a four-part documentary entitled &quot;Monsters Inside: The 24 Faces of Billy Milligan&quot;. The series was directed by Olivier Megaton. The docuseries mentions that Milligan had confessed being a murderer to his niece prior to his death, and links him to two unsolved murders. It features video interviews with various people connected to the case and tape recordings of his psychiatric sessions.

<text>Conroy Road is a road in the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from Walkley Road in the north to Bank Street in the south. Conroy Road forms the eastern fringe of the neighbourhood of Blossom Park, Ontario and ends in the community of Kemp Park, Ontario. Conroy Road is home to Pine Grove Forest and the Conroy Pit (see Greenbelt), owned by the National Capital Commission. Conroy Road has recently expanded, and divided between Walkley Road and Hunt Club Road due to residential expansion in Ottawa&#x27;s south end. The intersection of Conroy and Walkley may be the southern terminus of the controversial Alta Vista Parkway. Conroy Road is also known as Ottawa Road #125.

This road may be widened in the future due to rapid growth in the south end of the city. In this case, the whole route may be widened to 6 lanes including 2 HOV lanes between Walkley and Hunt Club and 4 lanes between Hunt Club and Bank Street.
