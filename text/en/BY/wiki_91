<text>U.S. Route 97 (US 97) is a major north–south route of the United States Numbered Highway System in the Pacific Northwest region. It runs for approximately through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, primarily serving interior areas on the east side of the Cascade Mountains. The highway terminates to the south at a junction with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Weed, California, and to the north at the Canadian border near Osoyoos, British Columbia, where it becomes British Columbia Highway 97. Major cities on the US 97 corridor include Klamath Falls, Bend, and Redmond in Oregon; and Yakima, Ellensburg, and Wenatchee in Washington. A portion of the highway in California and Oregon is part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway.

The highway was designated in 1926 as part of the original United States Numbered Highway System, replacing a set of routes designated by the state governments of Oregon and Washington. US 97 was extended into California in the 1930s and realigned several times in the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Route description==

===California===
US 97 begins at an interchange with I-5 in Weed, California, near Mount Shasta at the northern edge of the state. The highway travels northeast around Weed and into Shasta–Trinity National Forest, passing several lava fields as it ascends the northwest side of Mount Shasta. It turns east at Haystack Butte and travels around Deer Mountain, crossing the shore of Grass Lake and serving a rest area. After another series of turns, US 97 reaches its highest point in California at Mount Hebron Summit, above mean sea level.

The highway descends from Mount Hebron and leaves the national forest to travel northeast across the Butte Valley, a rural area with few settlements. After passing through the town of Macdoel, US 97 bisects a portion of the Butte Valley National Grassland and passes through a border inspection station operated by the California Department of Food and Agriculture near Dorris. The highway passes through Dorris on a series of city streets and continues northeast to cross into Oregon near a junction with California State Route 161 northwest of Indian Tom Lake. The California portion of US 97 is approximately long and lies entirely within Siskiyou County. It is also part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway system, which continues south from Weed towards Lassen Peak.

===Oregon===

US 97 travels northeast along the Klamath River from the California state line to Klamath Falls. It bypasses the city to the west on an expressway and has a business route to serve downtown Klamath Falls. The highway continues north, first along the east shore of Upper Klamath Lake and later to the east of Crater Lake, through the dry forests of the eastern Cascade Mountains. US 97 is directly connected to Crater Lake National Park via Oregon Route 62 and Oregon Route 138.

The highway travels northeast, following the Deschutes River through La Pine and to the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, where it passes over the Lava River Cave and travels around Lava Butte. US 97 expands into an expressway near the butte and turns north as it approaches Bend, the largest city in Central Oregon. The highway travels through Bend on the Bend Parkway, a four-lane expressway bypass that is supplemented by a parallel business route to the east. The business route is also used by US 20, which US 97 intersects twice north of downtown Bend.

US 97 continues northeast from Bend as a divided highway through Redmond, where it reverts to a two-lane highway. It travels north across the Crooked River National Grassland to Madras, where the highway is concurrent with US 26 and splits into a pair of one-way streets. US 97 continues northeast from Madras through a series of canyons to a junction with US 197, its sole auxiliary route. The two highways travel parallel to each other on opposite sides of the Deschutes River canyon, with US 197 to the west serving The Dalles and US 97 to the east passing through the sparsely-populated area between Shaniko and Wasco. From Wasco, the highway turns northwest to descend to the Columbia River Gorge, intersecting I-84 and US 30 at Biggs Junction. Immediately after the interchange, US 97 crosses the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge into Washington.

Under Oregon&#x27;s named highway system, US 97 is designated as part of The Dalles–California Highway No. 4 between California and US 197 and Sherman Highway No. 42 from US 197 to the Columbia River. It is described as Oregon&#x27;s most important highway east of the Cascades and serves as an alternate trucking route to the I-5 corridor. The southernmost section between the California state line and Klamath Falls is part of the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway, which continues to Crater Lake; the northernmost section between Shaniko and Biggs Junction is part of the Journey Through Time Scenic Byway, which continues east through John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.

===Washington===

The highway enters Washington at Maryhill, a community on the north side of the Columbia River that is home to a state park and Stonehenge replica. US 97 climbs from the river and briefly turns west on State Route 14 (SR 14) before continuing north over the Columbia Hills. The highway passes Goldendale and Goldendale Observatory State Park before turning northeast to cross the Simcoe Mountains via Satus Pass, located above sea level.

US 97 then traverses part of the Yakama Indian Reservation with shrub–steppe land that lies between the Simcoe Mountains and Toppenish Ridge. After crossing the latter, the highway descends into the Yakima Valley, passing through farmland and vineyards. US 97 then turns northwest at a junction with SR 22 in Toppenish and travels through Wapato before leaving the Yakima Indian Reservation and merging with I-82 and US 12 at Union Gap.

Now part of the freeway, US 97 runs north along the Yakima River through Union Gap and neighboring Yakima, where US 12 splits. The freeway then travels northeast over the Umtanum and Manastash ridges to reach the Kittitas Valley. I-82 ends in Ellensburg at a junction with I-90, which US 97 follows for before reverting to a two-lane road. The highway continues north into the Wenatchee Mountains (part of the Cascades) in Wenatchee National Forest and crosses Blewett Pass at above sea level. US 97 joins US 2 near Peshastin, traveling southeast on a divided highway along the Wenatchee River to the Wenatchee area.

The highway bypasses Wenatchee and crosses the Columbia River on the Richard Odabashian Bridge before turning north onto a two-lane road at a junction with SR 28. US 2 and US 97 travel along the east bank of the Columbia River, opposite US 97 Alternate on the west side, to Orondo, where US 2 turns east. US 97 continues north and east along the river to Chelan Falls, where it crosses the Beebe Bridge and is rejoined by the alternate route near Chelan. The highway follows the west bank of the Columbia River to Brewster, where it turns north to continue along the Okanogan River. US 97 then becomes concurrent with SR 20 for as they bypass Okanogan and Omak and continue through the Okanogan Highlands. SR 20 turns east at Tonasket while US 97 continues north to the Canadian border near Oroville and Osoyoos, where it terminates and becomes British Columbia Highway 97 (BC 97). BC 97 continues through the British Columbia Interior and terminates at the Yukon border, eventually becoming part of the Alaska Highway.

==History==

US 97 was established as part of the initial United States Numbered Highway System, adopted by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on November 11, 1926. It ran north from US 99 near Ashland, Oregon, to the Canadian border near Oroville, Washington, generally following the California-Banff Bee-Line (an early auto trail) through Oregon. The highway also used existing state roads that were designated in the 1910s by the Oregon and Washington governments, which had been partially paved. US 97 was extended south from Klamath Falls to Weed in 1935. During World War II, US 97 formed the eastern boundary of a restricted military zone for Washington and Oregon created in March 1942 ahead of the mass internment of Japanese Americans.

The state of Washington built several bridges on the Columbia River in the 1960s to replace existing ferry crossings, including two on US 97. The Sam Hill Memorial Bridge opened in 1962 to connect Biggs Junction, Oregon, with Maryhill, Washington, and operated as a toll bridge until 1975. The Beebe Bridge opened near Chelan in 1963, replacing a one-lane bridge, and was incorporated into US 97 with a realignment on the east side of the river that was approved in 1988. The relocation also resulted in the creation of US 97 Alternate on the old route to the west of the Columbia River between Wenatchee and Chelan. The highway was also relocated in some areas to accommodate the construction of dams on the Columbia River, including the Rocky Reach Dam near Wenatchee.

Several sections of the highway were also replaced with expressways or other limited-access roads bypassing city centers beginning in the 1950s. US 97 was relocated onto the Klamath Falls bypass when it opened in November 1959; the section cost $1.8 million to construct. US 97 was relocated onto an arterial street east of Bend in 1962, bypassing a congested section through downtown. The Okanogan and Omak sections were bypassed to the east by a new highway that opened in 1964. US 97 was relocated onto I-82 between Union Gap and Ellensburg when the freeway opened in 1971, bypassing downtown Yakima and the Yakima Canyon Highway (which became State Route 821).

A new route for US 97 through Bend, named the Bend Parkway, was proposed in the 1980s and opened in September 2001, relocating of the highway onto an elevated expressway through the city that cost $113 million to construct. A full freeway or bypass of Bend was also considered, but they were rejected due to funding and space constraints. A bypass in Redmond was opened in April 2008 at a cost of $90 million, moving US 97 onto a limited-access road around the east side of downtown Redmond. Plans for other bypasses in La Pine and Madras, as well as four-laning the entire highway in Oregon, have been proposed but not funded by the state government. In 2013, the cost of upgrading all of US 97 to a four-lane highway with limited access was estimated to be $10 billion.

===Proposed Alaska expansion===

An extension of US 97 to the state of Alaska was proposed in the 1950s and 1960s to promote the corridor as a continuous international highway. The Alaska International Rail and Highway Commission lobbied for the designation of US 97 from Fairbanks, Alaska, to Mexico City in the late 1950s; they were followed by a 1960s proposal from the Okanogan Cariboo Trail Association for a longer corridor to complement the Pan-American Highway. Their proposal would also have US 97 continue west to terminate in Nome, Alaska.

AASHO formally approved the Alaska extension of US 97 in December 1964, subject to the renumbering of highways in the Yukon Territory and British Columbia to match the &quot;97&quot; designation. The proposed extension would have followed Alaska Route 2 (AK-2) from the Yukon border to Fairbanks, terminating at a junction with AK-3. British Columbia had already renumbered its section to Highway 97, but the Yukon Territory declined a request from the Alaska Department of Highways to renumber Yukon Highway 1.

<text>Nicholas Christopher Michael Ring (30 October 1920 – 2 March 1979) was an Irish hurler whose league and championship career at senior level with the Cork county team spanned twenty-four years from 1939 to 1963. He established many championship records, including career appearances (65), scoring tally (33–208) and number of All-Ireland medals won (8); however, these records were subsequently bested by a number of players. Ring is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game, with many former players, commentators and fans rating him as the number one player of all time.

Born in Cloyne, County Cork, Ring first played competitive hurling following encouragement from his local national school teachers Michael O&#x27;Brien and Jerry Moynihan. He first appeared on the Cloyne minor team at the age of twelve before later winning a county minor championship medal with the nearby St Enda&#x27;s team. A county junior championship medal with Cloyne followed. However, a dispute with club officials saw Ring join Glen Rovers in Blackpool in 1941. Over the next twenty-six years with the club, Ring won one Munster medal and fourteen county senior championship medals. As a Gaelic footballer with the Glen&#x27;s sister club, St. Nicholas&#x27;, he also won a county senior championship medal. He retired from club hurling at the age of forty-six following a victory over University College Cork in the 1967 championship quarter-final. Over the course of his senior championship career Ring estimated that he played in 1,200 games.

Ring made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Cork minor panel for the All-Ireland final. In spite of victory, he was denied an All-Ireland medal as he was Cork&#x27;s last non-playing substitute. Still eligible for the grade in 1938, Ring collected a set of All-Ireland and Munster medals as a member of the starting fifteen. An unsuccessful year with the Cork junior hurlers followed before he made his senior debut during the 1939–40 league. Over the course of the next quarter of a century, Ring won eight All-Ireland medals, including a record four championships in a row from 1941 to 1944, a lone triumph in 1946 and three championships in a row from 1952 to 1954. The first player to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup three times as captain, he was denied a record-breaking ninth All-Ireland medal in 1956 in what was his last All-Ireland final appearance. Ring also won nine Munster medals, four National Hurling League medals and was named Hurler of the Year at the age of thirty-eight. He played his last game for Cork in June 1963. After indicating his willingness to line out once again in 1964, Ring failed to be selected for the Cork team, a move which effectively brought his inter-county career to an end.

After being chosen as a substitute on the Munster inter-provincial team in 1941, Ring was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for the following twenty-two years. He scored 42–105 as he won a record eighteen Railway Cup medals during that period, in an era when his skill and prowess drew crowds of up to 50,000 to Croke Park for the annual final on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. Ring&#x27;s retirement from the game is often cited as a contributory factor in the decline of the championship.

In retirement from playing Ring became involved in team management and coaching. As a mentor to the St. Finbarr&#x27;s College senior team, he guided them to their first two All-Ireland and Harty Cup triumphs in 1963 and 1969. At club level Ring was instrumental as a selector with Glen Rovers when they claimed their inaugural All-Ireland title in 1973, having earlier annexed the Munster and county senior championship titles. It was with the Cork senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector. After an unsuccessful campaign in his first season on the selection panel in 1973, Ring was dropped the following year before being reinstated in 1975. Over the next three years, Cork claimed successive All-Ireland titles.

Ring was most famous for his scoring prowess, physical strength and career longevity. He remains the only player to have competed at inter-county level in four different decades. Often the target of public attention for his hurling exploits, in private Ring was a shy and reserved individual. A teetotaller and non-smoker throughout his life, he was also a devout Catholic. Ring&#x27;s sudden death in March 1979 and the scenes which followed at his funeral were unprecedented in Cork since the death of the martyred Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Curtain in 1920. He was honoured posthumously by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000, while he was also named as the Century&#x27;s Best Hurler by the &quot;Irish Times&quot;.

==Early years==

Nicholas Christopher Michael Ring was the second youngest son of Nicholas (7 December 1892 – 12 March 1937) and Mary (née Lawton) Ring (1 November 1889 – 8 August 1953), and was born on 30 October 1920 at Kilboy Cross, less than a mile from the small village of Cloyne in rural East Cork. He had two brothers, Willie John and Paddy Joe, and two sisters – Katie and Mary Agnes. His family later moved to Cloyne where they occupied a house on Spittal Street, commonly referred to as Spit Lane. His father worked as a gardener for local landowners and, as a former Cloyne hurler, he instilled a passion for the game in his young son by taking him to club games in Cork, making the eighteen-mile journey by bicycle with his son on the cross-bar.

Ring was educated at the local national school in Cloyne, where he was noted as a quiet but diligent pupil. On one occasion, the schoolmaster, Maurice Spillane, offered a prize of a hurley and sliotar to the boy who would get the highest grade in the school. Ring applied himself diligently and got first place among forty-eight pupils.

As was common at the time Ring received no secondary education and left school before the age of fourteen. His first job was as an apprentice mechanic with the Williams firm in Midleton, before he later moved to Cork City where he found work as a lorry driver with Córas Iompair Éireann. In 1953 Ring became a delivery driver with Shell Oil.

==Club career==

===St. Enda&#x27;s===

Ring was just twelve years old when he played in his first minor game for Cloyne. Playing in goal he received a baptism of fire against Sarsfields. Two years later he was at right wing-forward and claimed his first medal when Cloyne won the annual Glenbower tournament.

As Cloyne were unable to field a minor team by the end of the decade, Ring joined the St. Enda&#x27;s amalgamation from Midleton in 1938. He won a county minor championship medal in this grade in 1938 following a 5–3 to 4–0 win over the Seán Clárach&#x27;s club from Charleville.

===Cloyne===

Ring&#x27;s impressive form with St. Enda&#x27;s was replicated with the Cloyne junior team that reached their first East Cork final. The Ring brothers were prominent from the start, with Willie John scoring 1–1 to help secure a 5–5 to 3–2 victory over Bride Rovers. Ring was sent off in the county championship quarter-final and was suspended for Cloyne&#x27;s subsequent semi-final defeat by Brian Dillons.

Cloyne retained the East Cork title in 1939 following a 7–3 to 1–1 defeat of Aghada. Ring&#x27;s scoring prowess brought subsequent county championship defeats of Clonakilty and Newtownshandrum as Cloyne qualified for their very first county junior championship final. In the days leading up to the match, there was much speculation that Ring would be unable to line out as he had an injured ankle. He started the game in the half-back line, however, as the game was going against Cloyne, Ring fought through the pain barrier and moved to the forwards where he scored five points. The 6–5 to 2–3 victory over Mayfield secured his first county championship medal at adult level.

===Glen Rovers===

====Early successes====

Following an acrimonious dispute with the Cloyne club committee, Ring and his two brothers left the club. Willie John joined Ballinacurra and Paddy Joe joined Russell Rovers, however, Ring remained unattached from a club for over a year. A fortuitous meeting with Jack Lynch in the summer of 1941 led to his Cork teammate inviting Ring to join the Glen Rovers club. Ring accepted the offer and made his debut in a championship semi-final defeat of St. Finbarr&#x27;s. He was at midfield for the subsequent decider against Ballincollig and gave, what was described in the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; as, a masterful display with his midfield partner Connie Buckley. The 4–7 to 2–2 victory stretched the Glen&#x27;s winning streak to eight successive championships. For Ring it was his first winners&#x27; medal.

Nine-in-a-row proved beyond Glen Rovers as Ballincollig exacted their revenge in the semi-final of the 1942 championship. After a season of reorganisation, which saw the introduction of nine new players to the team, Glen Rovers reached the 1944 championship final where they faced reigning champions and three-in-a-row hopefuls St. Finbarr&#x27;s. Ring was, once again, hugely influential and contributed 0–5 from centre-forward. The 5–7 to 3–3 victory gave him a second championship medal.

Divisional side Carrigdhoun provided the opposition as Glen Rovers reached the 1945 championship final in search of their tenth title. In what was probably the most exciting decider in which the club had been involved in so far, the Glen were five goals ahead after 25 minutes having played with a gale-force wind, however, Carrigdhoun fought back to reduce the arrears and set up an exciting finish. Ring top scored with 0–6 as Glen Rovers retained the championship title following a 4–10 to 5–3 victory.

====Glen Rovers march on====

After defeat by St. Finbarr&#x27;s in the 1946 championship final, Glen Rovers saw a number of changes to the team when they next contested the decider in 1948. Retirement and emigration and forced a number of changes, with Ring once again filling a midfield berth. Ring had a quiet game by his standards as Glen veterans such as Jack Lynch and Johnny Quirke secured the double scores 5–7 to 3–2 victory over roll of honour leaders Blackrock.

Glen Rovers were presented with their chance of retaining their title when they faced divisional side Imokilly in the 1949 championship decider. On a day of incessant rain, the game was described as one of the best of the year. Donie Twomey and Jack Lynch were the stars of the team as they bagged 5–2 between them. Ring scored the Glen&#x27;s sixth goal of the game and secured his fifth championship medal following the 6–5 to 0–14 victory.

Southside rivals St. Finbarr&#x27;s were the opponents as Glen Rovers were determined to make it three titles in-a-row in the 1950 championship final. St. Finbarr&#x27;s had the advantage of a very strong breeze in the first half and mounted attack after attack on the Glen goal but failed to raise the
green flag. The Glen backs gave one of the finest displays of defensive hurling ever seen in the championship and kept the southsiders tally for the
first half to 0–4. &quot;The Barr&#x27;s&quot; added just one further point to their tally after the interval. The 2–8 to 0–5 victory secured a third successive championship title for the club and a sixth winners&#x27; medal for Ring.

Sarsfields ended the Glen&#x27;s hopes of four-in-a-row in 1951, while defeat in the first round of 1952 looked like heralding a fallow period. The club returned stronger than ever when they qualified for the 1953 championship final where they faced Sarsfields once again. After a slow start Glen Rovers gave an exhibition of hurling all over the field, with Rings coring 1–2 in the process. The 8–5 to 4–3 victory secured his seventh championship medal.

In 1954 Ring was appointed club captain as Glen Rovers reached their 17th championship final in twenty years. Blackrock fielded a young team, however, Glen Rovers had eight inter-county players on their team. In spite of this, Blackrock stood up to the champions and the result remained in doubt to the end. A 3–7 to 3–2 victory secured an eighth championship medal for Ring, while he also had the honour of lifting the Seán Óg Murphy Cup.

====Three championships in-a-row====
Glen Rovers lost the next two championship deciders, while Ring was ruled out of the Glen&#x27;s 1958 championship triumph after being sent off in the semi-final. In spite of watching the game from the stands he still collected a ninth championship medal having played in the earlier rounds. He was back on the starting fifteen as Glen Rovers faced Blackrock in the 1959 championship final. Once again the game went to the wire and it was Ring who scored the winning goal with four minutes remaining. His tally of 1–6 was vital in securing the 3–11 to 3–5 victory and his own tenth championship medal.

A third successive championship beckoned in 1960 as Glen Rovers faced University College Cork in the championship decider. The game was regarded as one of the most thrill-packed and nerve-shattering games in the history of the championship. With time running out the Glen were behind, however, Ring pointed a free from the sideline to level the game. Johnny Clifford secured the lead when his sideline cut went straight over the bar. He gave the Glen a two-point lead straight from the puck-out when his shot sailed over the bar again. The 3–8 to 1–12 victory gave Ring his eleventh championship medal.

====Final successes====

Four-in-a-row once again proved beyond the Glen, however, the team endured a hard-fought campaign in 1962. In the semi-final against Imokilly 41-year-old Ring rolled back the years and scored three goals in the last fifteen minutes to help the team qualify for the final against University College Cork. The Glen led 3–3 to 0–2 at half-time but the college team powered by many inter-county stars fought back and went ahead with a minute to go but Tom Corbett sent over the equaliser with seconds left and secured a 3–7 to 2–10 draw. The replay proved to be even more exciting than the drawn match as Joe Salmon and Ring were singled out as the key figures in the Glen&#x27;s 3–8 to 2–10 victory.
Ring was appointed club captain again in 1964 as Glen Rovers faced St. Finbarr&#x27;s in the championship final. The Glen were underdogs and looked well beaten in half a dozen vital outfield positions in the opening thirty minutes. All changed in the second half with Ring scoring a vital goal to give the Glen the lead. &quot;The Barr&#x27;s&quot; battled back, however, at the full-time whistle the Glen were the champions and Ring collected a remarkable thirteenth championship medal and captained the team to victory for the second time. The Glen&#x27;s success took on extra significance as they became the first club to represent Cork in the newly created Munster Club Championship. After little interest in the opening rounds of the championship and lengthy delays, the Glen qualified to meet Mount Sion in the provincial decider. After the initial game was abandoned, Ring gave an exhibition of his skills in the replay and collected a Munster medal following a 3–7 to 1–7 victory.

In June 1967, Ring scored 1–2 and set up another goal in the Glen&#x27;s championship quarter-final defeat of University College Cork. While the Glen were scheduled to play Muskerry in the championship semi-final, he announced without warning that he wouldn&#x27;t be playing. After more than a quarter of a century of club hurling, Ring had retired.

==Inter-county career==

===Minor and junior===

By 1937 Ring&#x27;s performances as a minor hurler for St. Enda&#x27;s led to him being considered for the Cork minor hurling panel. He was only sixteen years-old throughout the championship campaign and was not selected for any of the provincial stages or for the All-Ireland semi-final. He was later listed as one of the substitutes for the subsequent All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. He played no part in that game which Cork won by 8–5 to 2–7. As the last substitute Ring shared in the victory but received no All-Ireland medal.

Ring was eligible for the minor grade again the following year and made his debut in a Cork jersey against Limerick on 22 May 1938. Although he would come to be known as a high-scoring forward, his inter-county career began as a defender. He later won a Munster medal following a 9–3 to 0–0 thrashing of Kerry. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1938 saw Ring make his first Croke Park appearance. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion and a tough game of hurling ensued. Ring, in spite of playing in defence, scored a goal from a 21-yard free to help his county to a 7–2 to 5–4 victory. It was his first All-Ireland medal with Cork, in what was his last game in the minor grade.

In 1939 Ring went on to become the youngest member of the Cork junior hurling team. There was no place for him in defence and he was seen as too vital a player to be left out of the starting fifteen, so instead he was moved to the forwards. Cork were fancied to retain their junior crown for a second year, however, Waterford got the better of them in their opening game.

===Senior career===

====Beginnings====

Ring made his first appearance for the Cork senior team when he was introduced as a substitute in a tournament game against Limerick in early 1939. Later that year on 22 October, he made his first competitive start when Cork played the newly crowned All-Ireland champions Kilkenny in the opening round of the 1939–40 National Hurling League. Ring marked four-time All-Ireland medal winner Paddy Phelan and, after a nervous start, settled into the game and scored a point in the 6–5 to 4–7 victory. Cork progressed through the league and qualified for the final against Tipperary. Ring, who was the youngest player on the Cork team, was named at right wing-forward and was one of the many goal-scorers in a 14-goal thriller. Cork won by 8–9 to 6–4 and he collected his first league medal. Ring retained the position of right wing-forward on Cork&#x27;s subsequent championship team and made his championship debut on 2 June 1940 in a 6–3 to 2–6 Munster quarter-final defeat of Tipperary.

====Four-in-a-row====

Cork were undefeated throughout their 1940–41 league campaign and qualified for a second successive league final. A 4–11 to 2–7 defeat of Dublin gave Ring a second league medal. Cork were well placed going into the subsequent championship and were drawn to play Tipperary in the Munster semi-final. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Tipperary changed matters and the match was called off the previous Monday by order of the Department of Agriculture. Tipperary, and other counties affected by the disease, wanted officials to put back the All-Ireland final, but Central Council would not agree. The council ruled that teams be nominated and if a nominated team won the All-Ireland that team would be awarded the 1941 championship. The Munster Council decided that Cork and Limerick should play off for the right to represent the province in the All-Ireland final. It was also agreed that the winners would play Tipperary later in the Munster final. Limerick had already qualified for the final as a result of victory over Clare. Cork easily accounted for Limerick, who were without Mick and John Mackey, by 8–10 to 2–3 and qualified for the All-Ireland final on 28 September 1941. Dublin, who were nominated by the Leinster Council, to represent the province provided little resistance. Johnny Quirke opened the goal-scoring for Cork before Ted O&#x27;Sullivan netted a second. Further goals by Quirke, O&#x27;Sullivan and Mick Brennan in the second half secured a 5–11 to 0–6 victory. It was one of the most one-sided championship deciders of all time, however, it did give Ring his very first All-Ireland medal at senior level. On 26 October 1941, Cork faced Tipperary in the delayed Munster final. The exertion of winning the All-Ireland had taken its toll on some of the Cork players who took a less than serious attitude to the game. Some players were accused of even being drunk during the match. Consequently, Cork were defeated by 5–4 to 2–5, thus creating the anomaly of being All-Ireland champions but Munster runners-up.

Losing the Munster decider tainted Ring&#x27;s view of the worth of the All-Ireland title, however, in 1942 Cork were given the opportunity to reverse the defeat when they qualified to meet Tipperary in the provincial final again. The game was played on an even keel for 45 minutes, however, a more youthful Cork side pulled away in the final quarter to win by 4–15 to 4–1. The victory gave Ring, who scored 0–5, his first Munster medal. Cork subsequently qualified to face Dublin in the All-Ireland final on 6 September 1942. The match was much more evenly contested than the corresponding fixture the previous year, with Ring scoring 0–3 in the opening exchanges. In spite of losing goalkeeper Ned Porter to an injury, Cork finished the stronger and a Derry Beckett goal at the end put the result beyond doubt. The 2–4 to 3–4 victory gave Ring his second successive All-Ireland medal.

Ring was instrumental in helping Cork to retain the Munster title in 1943. His contribution of 1–3 in a close game was vital in helping Cork to a 2–13 to 3–8 defeat of a Waterford team appearing in their first provincial decider in nine years. Antrim, having already pulled off two of the biggest shocks in the history of the championship by defeating Galway and Kilkenny, were Cork&#x27;s opponents in the All-Ireland final on 5 September 1943. The game was a poor spectacle as Cork routed their opponents by 5–16 to 0–4. Goals from Johnny Quirke (two), Ted O&#x27;Sullivan, Mick Brennan and Mick Kennefick helped secure a third successive All-Ireland winners&#x27; medal for Ring.

An unprecedented fourth successive All-Ireland was within Cork&#x27;s reach in 1944, however, Cork were nearly beaten by Limerick in the Munster final. After leading by nine points at one stage on the second half, a Limerick resurgence was spearheaded by the Mackey brothers, Dick Stokes, Paddy McCarthy and Dave Clohessy. Limerick had a two-point lead as the game drew to a close, however, Johnny Quirke scored his third goal in what looked like the winning score. Dick Stokes pointed from a free in the last minute to draw the game. The replay created enormous excitement with thousands making their way to Thurles in spite of wartime petrol rationing. With seven minutes left in the match it looked as if Cork&#x27;s great run of success was at an end. Trailing by four points, Mick Mackey burst through for his second goal, however, play was called back for a foul on him. Limerick missed the resulting free. Cork nicked a goal and a point to equalise. With a minute left, Mackey&#x27;s effort for a winning point went wide. Seconds later, Ring picked up the sliotar in his own half and set off up field, slipped past a series of challenges and, from 40 yards out, crashed the ball to the net for the winning goal. Ring&#x27;s last-minute goal secured a 4–6 to 3–6 victory and a third successive Munster medal. Many regard this passage of play as the moment that the mantle of hurling&#x27;s star player passed from Mick Mackey to Ring. Once again Cork went on to face Dublin in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1944. Cork looked sluggish and failed to score for the opening ten minutes, however, they held an 0–8 to 0–2 half-time advantage. Joe Kelly was the star forward as his 2–3 was instrumental in Cork securing a 2–13 to 1–2 victory. It was a victory which set Cork apart from all their predecessors as they became the first team to win four successive All-Ireland titles. On a personal level for Ring, he became the holder of four All-Ireland winners&#x27; medals before his 24th birthday.

====Fifth All-Ireland medal and defeat====
Cork&#x27;s hopes of extending their unbeaten run to five successive All-Ireland championships ended with a 2–13 to 3–2 defeat to Tipperary in the 1945 Munster semi-final. Ring was, rather surprisingly, subdued and outplayed for the hour by Tommy Purcell.

Ring was appointed captain of the Cork team in 1946, a year which saw him become the key player on the team. After the shock defeat the previous year, Cork qualified for the Munster final. An ageing Limerick team provided the opposition, however, in a disappointing game Cork had an easy victory by 3–8 to 1–3. Ring top scored with 0–5 as he collected his fourth Munster medal. A subsequent defeat of Galway allowed Cork to advance to an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny on 1 September 1946. Gerry O&#x27;Riordan scored Cork&#x27;s first goal as the first half drew to a close before Ring scored one of the most iconic goals of his career. Catching a clearance from Paddy O&#x27;Donovan on the half-way line, Ring took off on a solo-run at speed and dodged several Kilkenny defenders. After reaching the 21-yard line he let off a shoulder-high shot which flew straight to the net. Cork scored five more goals after the interval as they powered to a 7–5 to 3–8 victory. The victory secured a fifth All-Ireland medal in six seasons for Ring, while he also had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of the team.

Cork continued their provincial dominance in 1947. A 2–6 to 2–3 defeat of Limerick in the provincial decider gave Ring a fifth Munster medal. For the second year in succession, Cork qualified to play Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final on 7 September 1947. In what is often regarded as the greatest final of all time, Ring was held to just a single point. Mossy O&#x27;Riordan and Joe Kelly scored two goals to almost win the game for Cork, however, Kilkenny rallied with Terry Leahy and Jim Langton leading the charge. Leahy secured the equalising point before scoring one of the greatest match-winners ever. Having gathered the sliotar from a long clearance by right corner-back Paddy Grace, he struck from around 50 yards out and not far inside the Cusack Stand sideline. Immediately after the puck out the game ended and Kilkenny had won by 0–14 to 2–7. In spite of the All-Ireland defeat, Ring ended the year as the championship&#x27;s top scorer.

====Fallow period====

Cork qualified for their ninth Munster final in ten seasons in 1948, with Waterford providing the opposition. Many expected an easy Cork victory, however, the Waterford team held a narrow 2–3 to 1–5 half-time advantage. Ring contributed 1–4 over the hour, however, his last-gasp shot to draw the match after a 30-yards solo-run tailed off and went wide. The match ended with the resultant puck-out and Cork were defeated by 4–7 to 3–9.

In 1949 Ring endured the most torrid 150 minutes of championship hurling as Cork faced Tipperary in the Munster quarter-final. Tipperary had a relatively young and inexperienced team, however, for most of the match it looked as if youth would trump experience and with only a few minutes to spare they were ahead by 3–10 to 2–9. A solo effort from Jack Lynch, who by know was a TD, from his usual midfield berth resulted in a goal and brought his personal tally to 1–6. A point from Bernie Murphy levelled the scores at the death. The replay four weeks later was a classic. A Gerry O&#x27;Riordan goal gave Cork a 1–2 to 0–2 at the interval, however, Cork could have been further ahead but for a disallowed goal. Mossy O&#x27;Riordan sent a shot past Tipperary &#x27;keeper Tony Reddin, however, the sliotar appeared to rebound off the stanchion supporting the net before being cleared. In spite of Ring protesting with the officials, the referee waved the play on. After five minutes of injury time Cork still led by 1–5 to 0–5, however, Jimmy Kennedy scored the equalising goal and the game headed for extra-time. Both sides took different approaches as extra-time was about to be played. Tipperary retired to their dressing room where the players refreshed themselves with a creamery churn full of cold water. Cork on the other hand remained out on the field in what was one of the warmest days ever recorded in Ireland. Tipperary took to the field a much fresher team and an early goal from Mick Ryan gave them the lead and they held out to win by 2–8 to 1–9. Tipp&#x27;s Tommy Doyle, who earlier in the year ad been coaxed out of retirement, gave an inspired display by holding Ring scoreless for the two drawn games and the period of extra time. In spite of an early championship exit, Ring was chosen at centre-forward on the &quot;Sunday Press&quot; Team of the Year.

Ring was appointed captain of the Cork team for 1950 and there was an inevitability about the meeting of Cork and Tipperary in the Munster final. The official attendance at Fitzgerald Stadium was given as 39,000, however, up to 50,000 saw the game as gates were broken down, walls were scaled at the pitch invaded with supporters. There were supporters on the pitch at the throw-in, while a Cork fan tried to strike Tipperary&#x27;s Seán Kenny. Despite the raucous nature of the crowd, the Tipperary and Cork players managed to produce a classic game of hurling. A Paddy Kenny goal helped Tipperary into a 1–13 to 1–6 half-time lead. The start of the second half was delayed by yet another pitch invasion, and when it finally got under way, Ring dragged his team back into the contest by slaloming through the Tipperary defence and rifling the ball the sliotar to the net. As the match drifted away from their team the Cork fans grew more and more frustrated, and when a Jimmy Kennedy point put Tipperary 2–17 to 2–9 ahead with just ten minutes remaining, hundreds invaded the pitch from behind Tony Reddin&#x27;s goal and forced referee Liam O&#x27;Donoghue to call a halt to the match. The goalkeeper had oranges and overcoats thrown at him as he carried out his duties and on one occasion a supporter held him by the jersey as he went to clear the sliotar. Every Cork score was greeted by a pitch invasion, while pleas from Jack Lynch and Ring failed to quell them. Tipperary eventually won the game by 2–17 to 3–11.

Both Cork and Tipperary faced each other once again in the 1951 Munster final. At half time Tipperary led by 0–9 to 1–4, however, the restart saw Cork up the ante. Ring gave an absolute exhibition of scoring, collecting possession, beating tackles and setting up attacks. Tipperary, however, never faltered in the wake of Ring&#x27;s roaming presence. Playing out the final stages of the match in his bare feet Ring converted two more frees, however, Tipperary held on to win by 2–11 to 2–9.

====Three-in-a-row====

In 1952 Tipperary were presented with the possibility of equalling Cork&#x27;s record of four successive All-Ireland titles. When both sides met in that year&#x27;s Munster final, Tipperary looked the likely winners as Cork failed to score for the opening quarter. Trailing by 2–5 to 0–5 at the break, Ring gave an inspirational display in the second half. After being denied twice by Tipperary goalkeeper Tony Reddin, he set up Liam Dowling for a vital goal to leave Cork just a point in arrears. As the umpire was slow to raise the green flag to signal the goal, Ring ran in and waved it himself to the delight of the Cork supporters. Cork held out for the lead and won the game by 1–11 to 2–6. For the first time in eight years, Cork subsequently faced Dublin in the All-Ireland final on 7 September 1952. The Christy Ring-Des Ferguson duel was a highlight of the game, as Cork took a narrow 1–5 to 0–5 half-time lead after a Liam Dowling goal. Cork took complete control after the interval, with Dowling netting a second goal and Ring adding four points to the two he already scored in the first half. A 2–14 to 0–7 victory gave him his sixth All-Ireland medal. At the end of the year Ring was runner-up to Cavan Gaelic footballer Mick Higgins when the &quot;Gaelic Sportsman&quot; invited its readers to select the Sportsman of the Year.

Cork and Tipperary renewed their rivalry in 1953, when a record crowd of over 38,000 saw them contest the final of the league. Paddy Barry and Jimmy Lynam gave Cork a comfortable lead after scoring two goals as Tipperary missed several scoring chances. Paddy Kennedy responded with two goals at the end to narrow Cork&#x27;s margin of victory to 2–10 to 2–7. It was Ring&#x27;s fourth league medal overall. For the subsequent championship campaign, county champions Avondhu had the right to the captaincy of the Cork team. In an unprecedented but popular move, the North Cork division named Ring as captain. Having already met in the league decider, Cork and Tipperary qualified to meet in the Munster final as well. In one of the greatest games of his career, Ring had the sliotar in the Tipperary net from a 25-yards free after just a minute of play. He added eight further points, while also making a remarkable goal-line save to secure a 3–10 to 1–11 victory. For the second time in his career as captain, Ring collected the Munster Cup while he also won his seventh Munster medal. This victory qualified Cork for the All-Ireland final, however, between the two deciders Ring&#x27;s mother died. Her death had such a devastating effect on him that it seemed likely that he would miss the All-Ireland final. After much agonising and encouragement from family members, Ring rejoined the Cork team for training and was at left wing-forward for the game against Galway. After a slow start, which allowed Galway take an early lead, Cork regrouped and were 2–1 to 0–3 ahead at half-time after goals from Josie Hartnett and Ring. Galway remained close to Cork throughout the second half, however, a third goal from Tom O&#x27;Sullivan put the result beyond doubt and secured a 3–3 to 0–8 victory for Cork. As captain, Ring collected the Liam MacCarthy Cup for the second time in his career, while he also won a record seventh All-Ireland medal. In spite of victory, the game remained controversial over the alleged hitting of Galway captain Mickey Burke by Ring during the second half. There were ugly scenes at the post-match reception at the Gresham Hotel when an unknown Galway player struck Ring in retaliation as he was leaving the ballroom. To compound matters, both sets of players were staying in Barry&#x27;s Hotel. At breakfast the following morning Ring was punched in the face by another Galway player who then made a quick escape. Several more Galway players gathered across the road from the hotel and more fighting was expected, however, they were dispersed and Cork left Dublin for their homecoming celebrations. At the end of the year Ring once again finished runner-up in the &quot;Gaelic Sportsman&quot; Sportsman of the Year.

Ring remained as Cork captain for 1954, as he attempted to make history by becoming the first player to win eight All-Ireland medals. The Munster final saw Cork face Tipperary for the sixth consecutive season. Tipperary looked likely winners for much of the match, however, a Ring shot from 20 yards was saved by goalkeeper Tony Reddin before falling to the waiting Paddy Barry who clinched the winning goal. The 2–8 to 1–8 victory gave Ring his eighth Munster medal and his third victory as captain. After overcoming Galway in the semi-final, Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 5 September 1954. It was their first championship meeting in over fifty years. A record crowd of 84,856 saw the sides on level terms after the first quarter. A scramble after a sideline ball resulted in a Wexford goal by Tom Ryan after 26 minutes which gave them a 1–3 to 0–5 lead. With a strong breeze in their favour in the second half, Cork looked in a very strong position. Nicky Rackard had switched from full-forward to centre-forward to curb the long clearances of Vincy Twomey. By the tenth minute points from Tim Flood and Paddy Kehoe had Wexford 1–6 to 0–5 ahead. Then a goal-bound Ring shot struck Nick O&#x27;Donnell, breaking his collarbone. Further points cut the Cork deficit to two and with four minutes left young Johnny Clifford trapped the ball on the end line, dribbled it along the ground and shot past Art Foley from a narrow angle. Injury-time points from Hartnett and Ring gave Cork a 1–9 to 1–6 victory and secured the elusive eighth All-Ireland medal. He also became the first captain to receive the Liam MacCarthy Cup on three occasions.

====Last All-Ireland final====

Four-in-a-row proved beyond Cork as they were shocked by a Jimmy Smyth-inspired Clare in the 1955 Munster quarter-final. The defeat sparked several retirements and an influx of some new players to the Cork team which qualified to play reigning champions Limerick in the 1956 Munster final. With a quarter of the match remaining, Limerick were six points ahead, while Donal Broderick had prevented Ring from making any significant contribution. With time running out Ring took a pass from Josie Hartnett, fought his way through two defenders and, from a kneeling position, palmed the sliotar to the net. A minute later he netted his second goal after a solo-run down the left wing. After a Vivian Cobbe point steadied Limerick, Ring netted his third goal for a 5–5 to 3–5 victory and he won a ninth winners&#x27; medal. For the second time in three years, Cork faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 23 September 1956. The game reached a climax in the closing stages as Cork were two points down and Ring tried to salvage a victory. The sliotar broke to Ring after a 70-yards free and he headed straight for goal with the Wexford back line in pursuit. When he got to the 21-yard line he let off a shot that was set to rattle the back of the net, but the shot was somehow blocked by Wexford &#x27;keeper Art Foley and then cleared by him too. Ring remarked in an interview many years later; &quot;When I got through I thought I had it, but Foley had other ideas, and fair play to him he made a great save.&quot; After the sliotar had been cleared Ring raced in and grabbed Foley by the hair and said &quot;You little black bastard you&#x27;ve beaten us&quot;. Foley replied &quot;It&#x27;s about so and so time someone did&quot; before both men shook hands and Ring congratulated him on his save. Within a minute the ball dropped into Foley again and after it was cleared it made its way up the pitch and was buried in the back of the Cork net by Nicky Rackard giving Wexford a 2–14 to 2–8 victory. With seconds remaining in the final and Wexford holding onto a two-point lead, In what was only his second All-Ireland final defeat, Ring was denied his ninth All-Ireland medal. In the moments after the final whistle Nick O&#x27;Donnell, Bobby Rackard and Art Foley raised Ring onto their shoulders and carried him off the field in what was an unparalleled display of sportsmanship in any game, raised Ring onto their shoulders and carried him off the field. Towards the end of the year, Ring was chosen as the number one hurler of the year in the &quot;Gaelic Echo&quot;.

====Twilight years====

Following defeat in the 1956 All-Ireland final, it was expected by many that Ring, who was now thirty-six years-old, would retire from inter-county hurling. No such announcement came and he was included on Cork&#x27;s championship fifteen again for 1957. In the Munster semi-final victory over Tipperary, he suffered a broken wrist which ruled him out of the subsequent Munster final. Cork lost that game to an up-and-coming Waterford side by 1–11 to 1–6.

In 1958 Ring was named at full-forward on the Best Hurling Team of the Year in the &quot;Sunday Review&quot;, however, Cork exited the championship at the hands of Tipperary in the Munster semi-final. In 1959 Cork qualified to play Waterford in the Munster final. Ring contributed 1–5, including a late goal which looked like turning the game in Cork&#x27;s favour, however, Waterford held out for a 3–9 to 2–9 victory. In spite of a lack of championship success, Ring finished the year by being named Caltex Hurler of the Year. He remains the oldest player ever to win the award.

Ring finished the 1959–60 league as top scorer, including 3–4 in Cork&#x27;s league final defeat by Tipperary. Both sides renewed their rivalry in the subsequent Munster final. Described as the toughest game of hurling ever played, Cork enjoyed most of the possession in the first half, however, Tipperary led by a goal at the interval thanks to the accuracy of Jimmy Doyle. They stretched their lead to five points in the final quarter, however, a last-minute Cork goal left the result in doubt once again. Tipperary eventually won a gruelling contest by 4–13 to 4–11.

1961 followed a similar pattern to the year before. Ring was once again the top scorer for the 1960–61 season and, once again, Cork and Tipperary lined out against each other in the Munster final. An official attendance of 62,175 was the biggest ever recorded at a Cork-Tipperary match, or at any Irish sporting event outside of Croke Park. The real attendance may have been as high as 70,000 as the gates were thrown open halfway through the preceding minor game. Cork&#x27;s preparations were undermined by the large crowd. After togging off in the Railway Hotel in Limerick city centre, they had intended to travel by cars to the venue. The volume of bodies on the Ennis Road meant that the players had to abandon their cars and physically jostle their way through the crowd to make the throw-in time. At half-time Tipperary were out of sight by 3–3 to 0–1. The game ended on a sour note when Ring and John Doyle became involved in a punch-up while Tom Moloughney was knocked to the ground, allegedly after being struck by Ring. Tipperary won the game by 3–6 to 0–7, however, Ring was wrongly named in some national newspapers as having hit both Doyle and Moloughney. The National Union of Journalists later issued an apology to him.

After a good showing in the group stage, Cork qualified for a league final meeting with Kilkenny in 1962. Cork looked like they were in for a hefty defeat, however, a Ring goal gave Cork the lead against the run of play. Kilkenny regrouped and eventually secured a 1–8 to 1–6 victory in what was Ring&#x27;s last appearance at Croke Park for Cork. The subsequent Munster championship saw Ring lose out to Waterford at the semi-final stage. It would be his last championship game for Cork.

Ring played a tournament game against Waterford in June 1963 and was again later picked for Cork&#x27;s championship fifteen. On the day of the Munster quarter-final against Clare, it was announced that Ring would not be playing. Cork won by 4–15 to 2–11 and he was again included as a non-playing substitute for Cork&#x27;s subsequent Munster semi-final defeat by Tipperary.

In 1964 the Cork selectors considered bringing Ring back onto the team. He was picked at corner-forward for a tournament game in Cobh in May 1964, however, he didn&#x27;t line out on the day. In spite of this there was speculation that he would be listed on Cork&#x27;s championship panel. John Lyons and Jim Hurley had voted for his return, however, the other three selectors had the majority in leaving him off the panel. After 25 years Ring was effectively dropped and the curtain was brought down on his inter-county career.

====Possible comeback====
After Ring&#x27;s omission from the Cork team in 1964, there was little talk about a possible return the following year and it came to be accepted that Ring had retired. By 1966 his name was being mentioned again as a number of factors contributed to a possible recall to the Cork team. John Doyle of Tipperary had won his eighth All-Ireland medal the previous year, thereby equalling Ring&#x27;s seemingly unique record. Similarly, his displays at club level showed that he even at 45 years-of-age he was still the best forward in the county. As Cork defeated Clare and Limerick to qualify for the Munster final, there was intense speculation once again that he would be recalled to the team. Ring let it be known that he was available, however, when the selectors announced the team he was listed as a substitute and not on the starting fifteen. While the decision to recall him was not a unanimous one amongst the selectors, the prospect of winning another Munster medal and a record ninth All-Ireland medal as a substitute to another player did not appeal to Ring and he declined to be listed on the panel. This decision finally ended all of the speculation that he would make a dramatic comeback at some stage.

==Inter-provincial career==

===Early successes===

Ring was first chosen for the Munster team in 1941. He was an unused substitute in the Railway Cup final, as Munster faced a narrow 2–5 to 2–4 defeat by Leinster. The following year Ring was at centre-forward as Munster received a buy to the final where they faced Leinster once again. In a reversal of the previous year, Munster claimed a 4–9 to 4–5 victory, with Ring winning his very first Railway Cup medal.

In 1943 the midfield pairing on the Munster team was an all-Glen Rovers and all-Cork affair as Ring was partnered by Jack Lynch. The game was a close affair, however, Ring collected a second winners&#x27; medal as Munster triumphed by 4–3 to 3–5. He was moved back to his more usual centre-forward position the following year, as Munster made it three-in-a-row following a 4–10 to 4–4 defeat of first-time finalists Connacht. Ring retained the centre-forward berth on the 1945 Munster team that faced debutantes Ulster in the final. A huge 8–8 to 2–0 victory resulted in Munster claiming a record-equalling fourth successive Railway Cup.

Ring was partnered by his Glen Rovers colleague Jim Young in the half-forward line as Munster received a buy to the 1946 Railway Cup final. A Connacht team composed of all Galway players looked to be heading for a first victory, but Munster clawed their way back to level the game with time running out. Ring was the hero of the game for Munster, as his point from a sideline ball from 60 yards at the stroke of full-time secured a 3–12 to 4–8 victory. It was a record-breaking fifth title in succession for Munster and a fifth winners&#x27; medal for Ring. Six-in-a-row proved beyond Munster in 1947, as an all-Galway Connacht side secured an historic 2–5 to 1–1 victory.

===A record six-in-a-row===

Cork players made up one third of the Munster team in 1948 as the southern province faced Leinster in the decider. Ring was moved to the left wing-forward position where he made a number of spectacular solo-runs, one of which resulted in a pass to Ned Daly for the equalising point just before half-time. Vin Baston scored the winning goal shortly before the end, as Munster won by 3–5 to 2–5. It was Ring&#x27;s sixth Railway Cup medal.

Munster finished the decade by qualifying for their ninth successive Railway Cup final in 1949. Ring was the star player as Connacht provided the opposition and he secured Munster&#x27;s opening goal when his sideline ball slipped through goalkeeper Seánie Duggans fingers and trickled over the line. He netted a second goal after the interval when he doubled on a flying ball from 30 yards out. The 5–3 to 2–9 victory secured a seventh winners&#x27; medal for Ring.

The 1950 Railway Cup final saw Munster and Leinster renew their hurling rivalry. Ring was once again included on the Munster team, however, high winds, a large number of wides and a poor level of skill contributed to a drab and disjointed game. A 0–9 to 1–3 victory sealed an eighth Railway Cup medal for Ring.

Ring was moved to left corner-forward on the Munster team that faced Leinster in the 1951 Railway Cup final. He gave an exhibition of hurling and was vital to several Munster scores. His 1–1 in the closing stages sealed a 4–9 to 3–6 victory and a ninth Railway Cup medal.

In 1952 Munster qualified to meet Connacht in the Railway Cup decider, while Ring was on the brink of collecting a remarkable tenth winners&#x27; medal. He was once again at his devastating best and scored 1–3 in the first half, before adding a second goal after the break. A 5–11 to 4–2 victory gave Ring a tenth Railway Cup medal.

Ring was appointed captain of the Munster team in 1953 as the southern province qualified to play Leinster in the final. Ring was well marked by Jim Hogan and Jimmy Heffernan, however, he evaded them on several occasions to score some trademark points from tight angles. He set up Matt Nugent and Séamus Bannon for two goals, as Munster claimed a 5–7 to 5–5 victory. It was a record-breaking sixth successive title for Munster. Not only did Ring claim an eleventh Railway Cup medal but he also had the honour of accepting the cup as captain. Munster failed to add to their great run of success in 1954. Ring was once again well marshalled by Jim Hogan as a 0–9 to 0–5 victory gave Leinster their first Railway Cup title since 1941.

===Continued dominance===

In 1955 Ring resumed the captaincy as Munster qualified to play Connacht in the final. He was the key player for the southern province and scored a remarkable goal when he cupped the sliotar to the net after falling. He added three more points before Josie Hartentt scored the decisive goal in the 6–8 to 3–4 victory. After accepting the cup for the second time as captain, Ring later claimed his twelfth Railway Cup medal. Munster endured a heavy defeat at the hands of Leinster in the 1956 decider. After trailing by 3–5 to 0–2 after twenty-five minutes, Munster eventually lost by 5–11 to 1–7.

After defeat in 1956, Ring set out to atone by giving a masterful display against Leinster in the 1957 Railway Cup final. His tally of 3–5 was enough to beat the eastern province on his own. His first goal came after he grabbed the sliotar some 40 yards out and drove it past Art Foley. His second was a ground snap shot, while his third goal was a cut which he took on the turn after Foley lost the sliotar. The 5–7 to 2–5 victory gave Ring his thirteenth Railway Cup medal.

Munster and Leinster met for the third successive year in the 1958 Railway Cup final. Munster were underdogs going into the game, while Ring was well marked by Nick O&#x27;Donnell. He had a number of sharp shots at goal, however, the outstanding goalkeeping of Ollie Walsh prevented him from scoring. After a quiet game by his own standards, Ring won his fourteenth Railway Cup medal after a 3–7 to 3–5 victory.

In spite of his advancing age, Ring was chosen on the Munster team that qualified to play Connacht in the 1959 Railway Cup final. The occasion was a special one as the game marked the official opening of the new Hogan Stand. Ring rose to the occasion by giving a mercurial performance which saw him score 4–5. The 7–11 to 2–6 victory gave him a fifteenth Railway Cup medal.

===Final years===
As Ring approached his 40th birthday, he was included on the Munster team for the 20th time in 1960 as Leinster provided the opposition in the final. Ring had a quiet game as he struggled with a hand injury. In spite of this, he chipped in with two points in the 6–6 to 2–7 victory. It was his sixteenth Railway Cup medal.

Ring reached a remarkable milestone in 1961 when his inclusion on the Munster team marked his twentieth year of inter-provincial hurling. Old rivals Leinster provided the opposition in the final, however, for the first time Ring failed to carve out a match-winning performance. Two points from frees was his contribution before retiring with a leg injury in the 25th minute of the first half. Jimmy Doyle did the scoring damage with 2–6 as Munster made it five-in-a-row with a 4–12 to 3–9 victory.

An unprecedented sixth successive title proved beyond Munster in 1962, however, Munster and Leinster faced each other in a fourth successive Railway Cup final in 1963. Ring scored 1–1 as Munster looked the likely winners, however, Leinster rallied to secure a 5–5 apiece draw. The replay was a thrilling affair, however, a rain-soaked pitch impacted on the standard of the hurling. Ring had a disappointing game and was forced to retire through injury after fifteen minutes. Jimmy Smyth secured the winning point as Munster triumphed by 2–8 to 2–7. It was Ring&#x27;s eighteenth Railway Cup medal, while it also marked his last appearance for Munster.

==Coaching career==

===Farranferris===

In 1963 Ring took a mentoring role with the St. Finbarr&#x27;s College, Farranferris senior team. He had earlier been involved as a referee and as an unofficial adviser to various students, however, now he was included as a key member of the coaching team. That year St. Finbarr&#x27;s faced Ennis CBS as they qualified for their first Dr. Harty Cup final since 1952. Seánie Barry was the chief scorer and bagged 3–5 as &quot;Farna&quot; claimed the Munster title following a 4–9 to 4–3 victory. On 5 May 1963, St. Finbarr&#x27;s College faced Patrician College from Ballyfin in the All-Ireland decider. Having trailed for three-quarters of the game, St. Finabrr&#x27;s rallied in the closing stages thanks to 2–4 from the stick of Seánie Barry. The 4–8 to 3–4 victory was their first All-Ireland title.

After a number of disappointing seasons, Ring was still a mentor when St. Finbarr&#x27;s College qualified for the 1969 Harty Cup final. Holders Coláiste Chríost Rí provided the opposition in an all-Cork derby. Donie Collins and Tim Crowley were the key players as St. Finbarr&#x27;s College claimed their second Munster title after a 6–11 to 2–7 victory. St. Kieran&#x27;s College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 27 April 1969. Frank O&#x27;Brien had the game of his life and scored 4–2 as St. Kieran&#x27;s were unable to cope with the strong &quot;Farna&quot; challenge. The 5–15 to 2–1 victory gave St. Finbarr&#x27;s College their second All-Ireland title.

===Glen Rovers===

In 1972 Ring was a selector with the Glen Rovers senior team that, after a series of upsets in the earlier rounds, qualified for the championship decider against Youghal. The Glen were the hot favourites, however, they trailed by 1–8 to 12 at the interval. Youghal still held the upper hand at the three-quarter stage, however, Patsy Harte netted his second goal to steady the Glen team. Tom Buckley scored a third as Glen Rovers eventually triumphed by 3–15 to 1–10. A subsequent 2–9 to 1–10 defeat of Roscrea secured the Munster title. Glen Rovers later qualified to play St. Rynagh&#x27;s in the All-Ireland final, however, after the Offaly and Leinster champions&#x27; request for a postponement was denied, Glen Rovers were declared champions by committee. The club, however, preferred to contest the game and win it on the field of play. Only a few hundred spectators turned out at Croke Park to witness a game that lacked any entertainment value. Goalkeeper Finbarr O&#x27;Neill saved Glen Rovers on a number of occasions and the Cork team had a 1–10 to 1–3 lead at the interval. St. Rynaghs&#x27; six first-half wides did not help the situation. Glen Rovers stretched their lead to eleven points just after the restart. Basil Johnson got a goal for St. Rynagh&#x27;s, however, it was too little too late as Glen Rovers won by 2–18 to 2–8. The victory gave Ring an All-Ireland club victory as a selector.

After defeats at the hands of Blackrock in 1973 and 1975, the Glen qualified for yet another championship decider in 1976. Blackrock were the opponents once again, however, Ring had been planning for this game since the previous year&#x27;s defeat. Glen veteran Patsy Harte rolled back to years to score a vital 2–2 as Glen Rovers secured their 24th championship after a 2–7 to 0–10 victory. The subsequent Munster decider against South Liberties was a tough affair, with no less than three players being sent off. A 2–8 to 2–4 secured a third Munster title in all for Glen Rovers. Ring&#x27;s side subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final meeting with Camross on 27 March 1977. The Glen, with nine survivors from their previous victory in 1973, were the hot favourites for the title. Camross, which featured eight members of the Cuddy family, held the Glen in the first half. Glen Rovers powered on after the interval to secure an easy 2–12 to 0–8 victory. For Ring, it was the second All-Ireland title as a selector.

===Cork===
Ring was first included on the Cork senior hurling team selection committee during the 1972–73 season. Disappointing league and championship campaigns followed for Cork and he was dropped from the selection committee after just one year.

In September 1975 Ring was reappointed to the selection committee. Success was immediate as Cork secured their third successive Oireachtas Cup in October following a 3–13 to 2–7 defeat of Wexford. Cork annexed the Munster title in 1976 following a 3–15 to 4–5 defeat of Limerick before facing Wexford in the All-Ireland final on 5 September 1976. Wexford got off to a great start and were 2–2 to no score ahead after just six minutes. Wexford had a two-point lead with ten minutes to go, however, Ring, as selector, made a tactical switch which won the game. Mick Jacob had been Wexford&#x27;s most consistent defender at centre-back, however, Ring moved Jimmy Barry-Murphy to centre-forward and he was much fresher than the tiring Jacob. Barry-Murphy picked off two quick points before two from Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2–21 to 4–11 victory. It was Ring&#x27;s first All-Ireland victory as selector.

Cork faced Clare in the provincial decider in 1977, on a day when armed robbers made away with the takings from the gate of £24,579 during the second half of the game. Clare conceded an early penalty but they fought back to take the lead until a contentious red card for full back Jim Power turned the tide for Cork and they fought on to win by 4–15 to 4–10. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1977 was a repeat of the previous year, with Wexford providing the opposition once again. Prior to the game the Cork captain and full-back, Martin O&#x27;Doherty, had expressed his concerns over marking Wexford sharp-shooter Tony Doran. Ring advised O&#x27;Doherty to play as if he were the full-forward and to get to the ball first in a move which saw the position of full-back in a new role. O&#x27;Doherty finished the year as the All-Star full-back. Ring was also instrumental in moving Gerald McCarthy to centre-forward where he was charged with negating the influence of Tony Doran as Jimmy Barry-Murphy had done the year before. Seánie O&#x27;Leary, who broke his nose in the pre-match warm-up, scored the decisive goal for Cork as the game entered the last quarter, while Martin Coleman brought off a match-winning save from Christy Keogh to foil the Wexford comeback. A 1–17 to 3–8 victory gave Ring his second All-Ireland as a selector.

Cork secured the provincial title again in 1978 following a narrow 0–13 to 0–11 defeat of Clare. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny on 3 September 1978. Ring had the utmost confidence that Cork would win as he considered that Kilkenny team to be one of the poorest he had ever seen. Cork secured the All-Ireland title as a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1–15 to 2–8 victory. It was a third successive All-Ireland title, the first time since Ring&#x27;s own playing days that a team had secured a championship hat-trick. The All-Ireland final victory was his last visit to Croke Park.

==Death==

Although Ring was in his late fifties, there were no signs that he was in ill health. A non-smoker and non-drinker throughout his entire life, he remained active by regularly playing squash, something he did just two days before his death.

On Friday 2 March 1979, Ring had a scheduled appointment with his doctor and former teammate Dr. Jim Young in Cork city centre. As he was walking past the Cork College of Commerce on Morrisson&#x27;s Island at 3:30 pm he suffered a massive heart attack and collapsed. He was taken by ambulance to the South Infirmary Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. He was 58 years old.

The news of his death came as a great shock to the people of Ireland, and particularly to the people of Cork. His funeral was one of the biggest ever seen in Cork with up to 60,000 people lining the streets. It was also a remarkable hurling occasion with many of Ring&#x27;s former Munster and All-Ireland foes in attendance. Farrenferris pupils formed a guard of honour, while his coffin was draped in the famous black, green and gold Glen Rovers colours. Thirty books of condolence were filled by the thousands who attended the removal. The funeral Mass was presided over by Bishop Cornelius Lucey while the chief celebrant was Fr Charlie Lynch, brother of former Cork teammate Jack Lynch. Other former Cork teammates involved included Fr Con Cottrell, Fr Bernie Cotter and Fr J. J. O&#x27;Brien. Ring&#x27;s coffin was shouldered into St Colman&#x27;s churchyard in Cloyne by renowned sporting celebrities from Cork and other counties.

Ring&#x27;s graveside oration was delivered by Jack Lynch.

==Family life==

Ring married Rita Taylor at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough on 12 September 1962. Traffic in and around the city was held up for over an hour as thousands turned up to see the wedding. In a major departure for the national radio broadcaster, Radio Éireann included news of the event in their main news bulletin. It was their first report on a sports celebrity wedding. Fledgling television broadcaster, Telefís Éireann, also filmed the wedding for the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

The Rings lived at Avondale Park in Ballintemple for much of their married life. They experienced personal tragedy in raising their children: twin boys Christy and John were born in 1963, however, John died as an infant. Their daughter, Mary, was born in 1966.

==Memorials==

Shortly after his death, the Ring Memorial Committee&#x27;s primary objective was the construction of a suitable monument. The site of Ring&#x27;s former house in Cloyne was chosen as the location as it also acts as the entrance to the Cloyne playing field. Yann Goulet was the sculptor, while Midleton-based sculptor Michael Sheedy created the lettering on the base using Kilkenny limestone. Ring&#x27;s brother, Willie John, did much of the work on the building of the memorial walls. The monument was unveiled by Jack Lynch on 1 May 1983.

Several years later a statue of Ring was planned for Cork Airport. The idea led to a two-year project to select a winning submission from one of twelve sculptors. Seán McCarthy&#x27;s winning sculpture was unveiled by Rita Ring in 1995. Over a decade later, a new statue was created and located in the main car park in front of the terminal. The possibility of naming the airport after Ring was mooted in 2010.

In 1987 Cork Corporation sanctioned the construction of a new bridge across the River Lee. Located near the Cork Opera House and straddling the north channel of the river, the bridge links Emmett Place with Carroll&#x27;s Quay and was named the Christy Ring Bridge.

After the Cork County Board acquired the well-known soccer pitch Flower Lodge in 1988, a period of extensive renovation took place. On 23 May 1993, &quot;Páirc Chriostóir Uí Rinn&quot; was officially opened and dedicated in Ring&#x27;s honour.

A new championship for second-tier hurling teams was created and named the Christy Ring Cup in 2005.

==In popular culture==

In 1964, Ring was the star of a Louis Marcus film. Rather than a recounting of his life and many victories, the film is an instructional one with Ring demonstrating the various skills of the game and ending with highlights of the 1960 league final. The film had its premiere at the Savoy in Cork on 16 October 1964 and ran for several weeks.

&quot;G.A.A. Ballads of Rebel Cork&quot; contains 20 separate pieces on Ring, including a poem in Irish by Seán Ó Tuama. Theo Dorgan and Billy Ramsell have also written poems on Ring.

The poet Tom French has written a poem, A Pieta, about his death.

Ring has been the subject of several biographies, including &quot;Christy Ring&quot; by Val Dorgan (1980) and &quot;Christy Ring: Hurling&#x27;s Greatest&quot; by Tim Horgan (2007).

==Quotes==

* &quot;For the Doc! For the Doc!&quot; Ring&#x27;s jubilant statement to Éamonn Young following Cork&#x27;s defeat of Tipperary in the 1952 championship. &quot;The Doc&quot; refers to Young&#x27;s brother, Dr. Jim Young, who played with Ring on the Cork four-in-a-row team. In winning the Munster final, Cork had prevented Tipperary from the possibility of winning a fourth successive All-Ireland title and equalling the record of the nine.
* &quot;We&#x27;re the best in everything now.&quot; Ring&#x27;s comment after completing a championship double as a dual player with Glen Rovers and St. Nicholas&#x27; in 1954.
* &quot;Keep your eye on the ball, even when it&#x27;s in the referee&#x27;s pocket.&quot;
* &quot;It isn&#x27;t so quiet now boy.&quot; Ring&#x27;s riposte to Limerick&#x27;s Donal Broderick after scoring three goals in four minutes to win the 1956 Munster final. Broderick had held Ring scoreless for more than fifty minutes and had commented that he was having a quiet day.
* &quot;Babs, if Jimmy Doyle was as strong as you and I nobody would ever ask who was the best.&quot; Ring&#x27;s comment to Babs Keating when pressed on who he considered to be the greatest hurler of all time.
* &quot;I like to do the unorthodox and keep defenders worried...I usually attempt what other people might think is impossible.&quot;
* &quot;My hurling days are over. Let no one say the best hurlers belong to the past, they&#x27;re with us now and better yet to come.&quot;
* &quot;And if I hadn&#x27;t been carrying passengers like you, I&#x27;d have won at least eight more.&quot; Ring&#x27;s withering put down to a former Cork teammate. The unnamed former player was, by then, a county board official and questioned Ring as to why he tried to get into a match without his official pass by saying: &quot;But Christy, you ought to have [your pass]. You won no less than eight All-Ireland medals&quot;.
* &quot;You don&#x27;t play hurling with your nose.&quot; Ring&#x27;s reply to Seánie O&#x27;Leary who feared he may miss the All-Ireland final after breaking his nose when a sliotar struck him during the warm-up prior to the 1977 All-Ireland final.
* &quot;The contest was the most important thing for me. Playing the game was the most important thing as far as I was concerned. It wasn&#x27;t what I got from it or what was at the end...but to play hurling for Cork...that was the most important thing.&quot;
* &quot;&quot;The Glen has meant a lot to me. I don&#x27;t know how you describe the spirit of the Glen, no more than describe the spirit of &quot;the Barr&#x27;s&quot;, or &quot;the Rockies&quot;...or the spirit of Cloyne...I don&#x27;t know...it&#x27;s just that they have this tradition of playing the game as it should be played; hard and tough.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;You should have somebody else here today instead of me. It&#x27;s about time they stopped talking about me.&quot; Ring in a rare television interview with Donncha Ó Dúlaing shortly before his death in 1979.

==Tributes==

* &quot;&#x27;Tis a sin to bury that man.&quot; Unknown woman overheard by Professor Seán Ó Tuama at the removal of Ring.
* &quot;&#x27;I have seen them all and he is the greatest hurler ever. Ring is a natural. A pocket Hercules, beautifully built with a powerful frame.&quot; Pioneering Gaelic games journalist P.D. Mehigan whose recall of games spanned nearly seventy years.
* &quot;&#x27;I was twenty years of age in 1922 when I saw my first senior match. I have seen every great hurler since. I have never seen one who attained Christy&#x27;s standard of excellence and maintained that standard over such a long period of time.&quot; Four-time All-Ireland medal winner with Cork Jim Hurley.
* &quot;&#x27;The greatest hurler ever to grace a playing field.&quot; One-time All-Ireland medal winner with Waterford Christy Moylan.
* &quot;&#x27;Any of us who saw him play were privileged. We will never see the like of him again. In my book Christy Ring was always number one, and he always will be.&quot; Two-time All-Ireland medal winner with Wexford Bobby Rackard.
* &quot;&#x27;[He] enriched the game of hurling more than any other man I knew over forty years. He lived and breathed the very spirit of hurling. He was a giant among giants.&quot; Former President of the GAA Pat Fanning.
* &quot;&#x27;To us kids Christy was the ultimate. We all modelled ourselves on him.&quot; Six-time All-Ireland medal winner with Kilkenny Eddie Keher.
* &quot;&#x27;When it comes to selecting the greatest exponent the game has ever seen, measured opinion sees one name out of reach – above all others. That name is Christy Ring of Cork.&quot; Three-time All-Ireland medal winner with Wexford Billy Rackard.
* &quot;&#x27;There are no words I know of that can adequately do justice to the greatness of the hurler, Christy Ring. If hurling were an international sport his name and fame would stand at least alongside Pelé in soccer, Bradman in cricket, Edwards and Kyle in rugby, Nicklaus and Palmer in golf. But there is no method of measuring genius, man for man, in the various sports. All one can say is that Ring was a genius in his own sport. And his genius in hurling was incomparable.&quot; &quot;Irish Times&quot; sports journalist and friend of Ring, Paddy Downey, writing at the time of his death in 1979.
* &quot;We carried him at last.&quot; Three-time All-Ireland medal winner with Cork Paddy Barry, speaking after shouldering the coffin at Ring&#x27;s funeral. The quote refers to the numerous times that Ring saved Cork from almost certain defeat.
* &quot;&#x27;Ring was hurling&#x27;s Shakespeare, its Pelé, its Mozart. He came as close to perfection as any sportsman can.&quot; &quot;Irish Independent journalist Éamonn Sweeney.
* &quot;There would be no question about who was the greatest hurler. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Ring was the greatest hurler of all time.&quot; Two-time All-Ireland medal winner with Wexford Martin Codd.
* &quot;I never saw anyone like Christy Ring. In my opinion, his sort will never be seen again. He was the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, he had everything.&quot; Former GAA President, Paddy Buggy.
* &quot;He&#x27;s something that comes around once every hundred years. I guarantee you that. I haven&#x27;t seen anything like him and I don&#x27;t believe I ever will see anybody like him...Tipperary won eight All-Irelands for me but Ring won eight All-Irelands for Cork.&quot; Fellow eight-time All-Ireland medal winner with Tipperary John Doyle.
* &quot;Some people say Mackey was...Eddie Keher...but I have to give it to Christy, number one. Always did.&quot; Six-time All-Ireland medal winner with Tipperary Jimmy Doyle.
* &quot;He would be remembered for his hurling ability, for his skill. And the enjoyment, in particular, that he gave to the crowds. He&#x27;ll always be remembered, he will never be forgotten. There was only one Christy Ring and there&#x27;ll never be another.&quot; Three-time All-Ireland medal winner with Cork Willie John Daly.

<text>Population ageing is an increasing median age in a population because of declining fertility rates and rising life expectancy. Most countries have rising life expectancy and an ageing population, trends that emerged first in developed countries but are now seen in virtually all developing countries. In most developed countries, the phenomenon of population aging began to gradually emerge in the late 19th century. The aging of the world population occurred in the late 20th century, with the proportion of people aged 65 and above accounting for 6% of the total population. This reflects the overall decline in the world&#x27;s fertility rate at that time. That is the case for every country in the world except the 18 countries designated as &quot;demographic outliers&quot; by the United Nations. The aged population is currently at its highest level in human history. The UN predicts the rate of population ageing in the 21st century will exceed that of the previous century. The number of people aged 60 years and over has tripled since 1950 and reached 600 million in 2000 and surpassed 700 million in 2006. It is projected that the combined senior and geriatric population will reach 2.1 billion by 2050. Countries vary significantly in terms of the degree and pace of ageing, and the UN expects populations that began ageing later will have less time to adapt to its implications.

==Overview==
Population ageing is a shift in the distribution of a country&#x27;s population towards older ages and is usually reflected in an increase in the population&#x27;s mean and median ages, a decline in the proportion of the population composed of children, and a rise in the proportion of the population composed of the elderly. Population ageing is widespread across the world and is most advanced in the most highly developed countries, but it is growing faster in less developed regions, which means that older persons will be increasingly concentrated in the less developed regions of the world. The Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, however, concluded that population ageing has slowed considerably in Europe and will have the greatest future impact in Asia, especially since Asia is in stage five (very low birth rate and low death rate) of the demographic transition model.

Among the countries currently classified by the United Nations as more developed (with a total population of 1.2 billion in 2005), the overall median age rose from 28 in 1950 to 40 in 2010 and is forecast to rise to 44 by 2050. The corresponding figures for the world as a whole are 24 in 1950, 29 in 2010, and 36 in 2050. For the less developed regions, the median age will go from 26 in 2010 to 35 in 2050.

Population ageing arises from two possibly-related demographic effects: increasing longevity and declining fertility. An increase in longevity raises the average age of the population by increasing the numbers of surviving older people. A decline in fertility reduces the number of babies, and as the effect continues, the numbers of younger people in general also reduce. Of the two forces, declining fertility now contributes to most of the population ageing in the world. More specifically, the large decline in the overall fertility rate over the last half-century is primarily responsible for the population ageing in the world&#x27;s most developed countries. Because many developing countries are going through faster fertility transitions, they will experience even faster population ageing than the currently-developed countries will.

The rate at which the population ages is likely to increase over the next three decades; however, few countries know whether their older population are living the extra years of life in good or poor health. A &quot;compression of morbidity&quot; would imply reduced disability in old age, but an expansion would see an increase in poor health with increased longevity. Another option has been posed for a situation of &quot;dynamic equilibrium.&quot; That is crucial information for governments if the limits of lifespan continue to increase indefinitely, as some researchers believe. The World Health Organization&#x27;s suite of household health studies is working to provide the needed health and well-being evidence, such as the World Health Survey, and the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE). The surveys cover 308,000 respondents aged at least 18 and 81,000 aged at least 50 from 70 countries.

The Global Ageing Survey, exploring attitudes, expectations, and behaviours towards later life and retirement, directed by George Leeson, and covering 44,000 people aged 40–80 in 24 countries from across the globe, has revealed that many people are now fully aware of the ageing of the world&#x27;s population and the implications that it will have on their lives and those of their children and grandchildren.

Canada has the highest per capita immigration rate in the world, partly to counter population ageing. The C. D. Howe Institute, a conservative think tank, has suggested that immigration cannot be used as a viable means to counter population ageing. That conclusion is also seen in the work of other scholars. The demographers Peter McDonald and Rebecca Kippen commented, &quot;As fertility sinks further below replacement level, increasingly higher levels of annual net migration will be required to maintain a target of even zero population growth.&quot;

==Around the world==
The world&#x27;s older population is growing dramatically.
The more developed countries also have older populations as their citizens live longer. Less developed countries have much younger populations. An interactive version of the map is available here.
Asia and Africa are the two regions with a significant number of countries facing population ageing. Within 20 years, many countries in those regions will face a situation of the largest population cohort being those over 65 and the average age approaching 50. In 2100, according to research led by the University of Washington, 2.4 billion people will be over the age of 65, compared with 1.7 billion under the age of 20. The Oxford Institute of Population Ageing is an institution looking at global population ageing. Its research reveals that many of the views of global ageing are based on myths and that there will be considerable opportunities for the world as its population matures, as the Institute&#x27;s director, Professor Sarah Harper, highlighted in her book &quot;Ageing Societies&quot;.

Most of the developed countries now have sub-replacement fertility levels, and population growth now depends largely on immigration together with population momentum, which also arises from previous large generations now enjoying longer life expectancy.

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds, 100,000 per day, die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialised nations, that proportion is much higher and reaches 90%.

==Well-being and social policies==
The economic effects of an ageing population are considerable. Nowadays, more and more people are paying attention to the economic issues and social policy challenges related to the elderly population. Older people have higher accumulated savings per head than younger people but spend less on consumer goods. Depending on the age ranges at which the changes occur, an ageing population may thus result in lower interest rates and the economic benefits of lower inflation. Some economists in Japan see advantages in such changes, notably the opportunity to progress automation and technological development without causing unemployment, and emphasise a shift from GDP to personal well-being.

However, population ageing also increases some categories of expenditure, including some met from public finances. The largest area of expenditure in many countries is now health care, whose cost is likely to increase dramatically as populations age. This would present governments with hard choices between higher taxes, including a possible reweighing of tax from earnings to consumption and a reduced government role in providing health care.The working population will face greater pressure, and a portion of their taxes will have to be used to pay for healthcare and pensions for the elderly. However, recent studies in some countries demonstrate the dramatic rising costs of health care are more attributable to rising drug and doctor costs and the higher use of diagnostic testing by all age groups, not to the ageing population that is often claimed.

The second-largest expenditure of most governments is education, with expenses that tend to fall with an ageing population, especially as fewer young people would probably continue into tertiary education as they would be in demand as part of the work force.
Social security systems have also begun to experience problems. Earlier defined benefit pension systems are experiencing sustainability problems because of the increased longevity. The extension of the pension period was not paired with an extension of the active labour period or a rise in pension contributions, which has resulted in a decline of replacement ratios.

Population ageing also affects workforce. In many countries, the increase in the number of elderly people means the weakening or disappearance of the &quot;demographic dividend&quot;, and social resources have to flow more towards elderly people in need of support. The demographic dividend refers to the beneficial impact of a decline in fertility rate on a country&#x27;s population age structure and economic growth. The older workers would spend more time on work and human capital of an ageing workforce is low, reducing labor productivity.

The expectation of continuing population ageing prompts questions about welfare states&#x27; capacity to meet the needs of the population. In the early 2000s, the World Health Organization set up guidelines to encourage &quot;active ageing&quot; and to help local governments address the challenges of an ageing population (Global Age-Friendly Cities) with regard to urbanization, housing, transportation, social participation, health services, etc. Local governments are well positioned to meet the needs of local, smaller populations, but as their resources vary from one to another (e.g. property taxes, the existence of community organizations), the greater responsibility on local governments is likely to increase inequalities. In Canada, the most fortunate and healthier elders tend to live in more prosperous cities offering a wide range of services, but the less fortunate lack access to the same level of resources. Private residences for the elderly also provide many services related to health and social participation (e.g. pharmacy, group activities, and events) on site, but they are not accessible to the less fortunate. Also, the environmental gerontology indicates the importance of the environment in active ageing. In fact, promoting good environments (natural, built, social) in ageing can improve health and quality of life and reduce the problems of disability and dependence, and, in general, social spending and health spending.

An ageing population may provide incentive for technological progress, as some hypothesise the effect of a shrinking workforce may be offset by automation and productivity gains.

Meanwhile, improving the productivity of the elderly has also become a method to alleviate the problem of social aging. But this first requires increasing their investment in education, and providing suitable job opportunities is equally important.

Generally in West Africa and specifically in Ghana, social policy implications of demographic ageing are multidimensional (such as rural-urban distribution, gender composition, levels of literacy/illiteracy as well as their occupational histories and income security). Current policies on ageing in Ghana seem to be disjointed, and ideas on documents on to improve policies in population ageing have yet to be concretely implemented, perhaps partly because of many arguments that older people are only a small proportion of the population

Global ageing populations seem to cause many countries to be increasing the age for old age security from 60 to 65 to decrease the cost of the scheme of the GDP. However, even so, in industrialized countries with the greatest improvement in life expectancy, discussions about continuing to raise the eligibility age for pension benefits have intensified in order to reduce economic burden more significantly. Age discrimination can be defined as &quot;the systematic and institutionalized denial of the rights of older people on the basis of their age by individuals, groups, organisations, and institutions.&quot; Some of the abuse can be a result of ignorance, thoughtlessness, prejudice, and stereotyping. Forms of discrimination are economic accessibility, social accessibility, temporal accessibility and administrative accessibility.

In most countries worldwide, particularly countries in Africa, older people are typically the poorest members of the social spectrum and live below the poverty line.

Moreover, the growing burden of health expenditure has evolved into a social policy and cost management issue, not just a population issue.

<doc id="720685" wikidata="Q237258" url="?curid=720685" title="Yilan County, Taiwan">
<text>Yilan County, alternately spelled I-lan, is a county in northeastern Taiwan. Yilan is the northernmost county on the island of Taiwan, with a population of 450,031. Its seat is located in Yilan City.

Before the Han Chinese Wu Sha led his company into large-scale reclamation in today’s Yilan in 1787, the area was mainly inhabited by the indigenous Kavalan people. During the Japanese rule, much of the present day Yilan County was part of Japan within its Taihoku Prefecture. When the Republic of China took over Taiwan in 1945, it became part of Taipei County until 10 October 1950 when 12 southeastern townships of Taipei County split off to form the present day Yilan County.

==Name==

The name &quot;Yilan&quot; derives from the indigenous Kavalan people. Other former names in reference to this area in the Yilan Plain include &quot;Kabalan&quot;, &quot;Kavalan&quot;, &quot;Kavaland&quot;, &quot;kap-a-lan&quot;, &quot;Yiland&quot; and &quot;Gilan&quot;. Before 2009, the county&#x27;s official name was transliterated as Ilan.
==History==
===Early history===
Since early ages, many people have traveled from far places to Yilan. Indigenous tribes that have settled in Yilan are Kavalan people and Atayal people.

The Kavalan people came by the sea and lived by the river at Yilan Plain since around 1,000 years ago. They mostly speak the Austronesian languages. Their settlements consisted of small villages along rivers with around 40–50 communities scattered around the area with a total population of approximately 10,000 people. The Atayal people came by crossing the Xiyuan Pass and settled in the mountain areas.

The Atayal people arrived in Yilan around 250 years ago and settled along the upper Dazhuoshui River. Later, the tribes crossed the Siyuan Pass to reach the valley upstream of the Zhuoshui River. These people are the current residents of Datong Township. Other parts of the Atayal people headed east to enter and settle along the Nan&#x27;ao North River and Heping North River. These groups are now settled in Nan-ao Township.

Around 200 years ago, at the end of the 18th century, the Han Chinese traversed the mountain range and settled in Yilan. Large populations began taming the wilderness, cultivating the fields and building irrigation channels. They used various means to seize lands from the Kavalans. Some Kavalans left their homes while some others migrated southwards to Hualien and Taitung coastlines and established settlements.

===Spanish Formosa===
The Spaniards began arriving in Taiwan in the 17th century. In 1626, the Spaniards led an invasion under the pretext of ship crews having been slain by Taiwanese barbarians. They then torched harbors and surrounding villages, and even went as far as taking over Su&#x27;ao Town and established a city called Saint Lorenzo.

===Dutch Formosa===
The Spaniards were subsequently ousted by the Dutch who had taken over the southern part of Taiwan and established Dutch Formosa. In 1640, the Dutch began contacting Han Chinese merchants for trade and levying taxes on various commercial goods. The merchants had to pay all company taxes but also enjoyed the right to monopolize trade.

===Kingdom of Tungning===
During the Kingdom of Tungning era, the previous economy monopoly system developed during the Dutch Formosa continued to be practiced.

===Qing dynasty===
When the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan, they established the Kavalan sub-prefecture in Yilan. In 1806, armed conflicts broke out among various ethnic immigrants, followed by pillaging by pirates. The Qing dynasty government subsequently realized that if they continued to disregard the Kavalan people and did not establish rule of law and a system of defense, Yilan would become a haven for criminals and outlaws, a thorn in the side for Taiwan. In 1809, Jiaqing Emperor incorporated Kavalan into the domain of the empire. Troops were dispatched to quell pirate attacks and chart local territory.

Local government systems in Taiwan underwent many changes during the Qing dynasty period. But with regards to administrative levels lower than the county, including local villages, there were no major changes. The earliest organization and planning of Yilan consisted of seven citadels. In 1835, the seven citadels were further divided into 12 citadels based on the needs of the changing population and environment. This arrangement remained unchanged until the end of Qing dynasty rule.

After the Mudan Incident in 1874, Qing rulers changed their passive attitude and took a more ambitious approach in ruling Taiwan. The original aboriginal term Kavalan district was renamed with a more Han-centric Yilan name and the administrative system was also changed accordingly from the original temporary &quot;district&quot; to a formally governed &quot;county&quot;. In 1875, the newly created Taipeh Prefecture included modern-day Yilan County.

===Empire of Japan===
After the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the Qing government handed over Taiwan to Japan in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Modern-day Yilan County covers , , and as they existed from 1920 to 1945, all under Taihoku Prefecture, during Japanese rule.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, the present-day area of Yilan County was incorporated under Taipei County. On 10 October 1950, Yilan County was established as a county of Taiwan Province with Yilan City as the county seat. In 1998, the government streamlined Taiwan Province and Yilan County became administered by the Executive Yuan while the remaining institutions of this province have been dissolved in 2018.

==Geography==
Yilan County sits on the Yilan Plain, a combined alluvial plain created by Lanyang River and other minor streams with a rough shape of triangle. On the three vertices of the triangle sit the Toucheng, Sanxing and Su-ao Townships with a roughly equal distance of 30 km on the three sides. The Xueshan Range sits on the northwest of Yilan County from Toucheng to Sanxing. The county is geographically divided into the cliffs and the plains. The Central Mountain Range sits to the south from Sanxing to Su&#x27;ao.

The Upper Lanyang River is steep and the rapid current is highly erosive. Large amount of silt carried by the river have little time to settle because of the high slope of the lands where it flows out of the mountains and valleys. An alluvial fan is formed as a result of scattered sand and gravel settling down. Large amount of gravel accumulate in the shallow stream bed, creating alluvial fans that often forms into web-like pattern. The river tends to change courses after floods caused by heavy rainfall or river overflow. The Lanyang River slows down as it reaches mid and downstream where silt begins to settle.

Yilan County is located in the northeastern Taiwan Island which covers an area of 2,143 km2. The longest distance from east to west is 63 km and from north to south is 74 km. From the mountain areas downwards, the land falls in altitude in the stages of mountains, alleys, alluvial plains, lowlands, swamps, sand hills and finally coastline.

Yilan&#x27;s Toucheng Township includes Guishan Island and Guiluan Island. The Senkaku Islands, known in Mandarin as the Tiaoyutai Islands, are claimed as part of the township.

<doc id="720697" wikidata="Q2976200" url="?curid=720697" title="Khâgne">
<text>&#x27; (), officially known as &#x27;, is a two-year academic program in the French “” (≈undergraduate) system, with a specialization in the humanities (A/L) or social science (B/L). It is one of the three main types of (CPGE, informally ), contrasting with other CPGE majors such as in mathematics and engineering, or in the business domain.

Strictly speaking, the word refers to the final year of that program. In fact, the course articulates into two years with separate names:
* year 1: officially , casually 
* year 2 (+3 +4): officially , casually  
The two-year program as a whole is commonly called &quot;hypokhâgne-khâgne&quot; , or simply &quot;khâgne&quot;.

In 2020, about 130 lycées scattered across France proposed &quot;hypokhâgne&quot; classes (1st year), and at least 30 had a &quot;khâgne&quot; (2nd year). Historically famous institutions for preparing the &quot;khâgne&quot; program – some since the 19th century – include prestigious &quot;lycées&quot; in Paris (lycées Henri IV, Louis-le-Grand, Condorcet, Fénelon, Janson-de-Sailly…), around Paris (Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, in Versailles, …) and in major cities of the country (e.g. Lycée du Parc in Lyon, Lycée Montaigne in Bordeaux…).

==Main features of the &quot;khâgne&quot; program==
Once they have graduated from secondary school (), French students with a strong interest in the Humanities may choose to follow a Licence curriculum in a university (&quot;l&#x27;université&quot;, slang &quot;la fac&quot;); or they may opt for the more selective course, which is situated outside the university system, taking place in a just like secondary school. 

One of the formal differences between the two competing systems (university vs. &quot;khâgne&quot;) is that, while university students discover a new form of academic organization (with typically large gatherings of students in lecture halls), students continue the organization they were familiar with in high schools (&quot;lycée&quot;), characterized by a stable class group with a maximum of 35 to 40 members. This is conducive to more substantial interaction between students and their professors, which is commonly understood as favouring high-quality learning.

When the khâgne program is based in a public school, the tuition fee normally ranges between 0 and 300 euros per year; private schools require higher fees. The most prestigious khâgne programs in France are found in public schools, and are thus essentially free of charge.

The official objective of is to prepare undergraduate students for the competitive entrance examination () to the three (ENS) — more specifically to their &quot;Humanities and Social science&quot; departments (, &quot;Section Lettres et sciences humaines&quot;).

In case of an unsuccessful attempt at at the end of their , students are allowed to repeat that second year once or even twice. This means that students can remain in the whole programme from two up to four years in total (see also the section on slang terms). 

For the vast majority of students who will fail to get selected to ENS, having merely attended a curriculum remains valued &quot;per se&quot; on the job market, even though it provides no formal degree.

== Current organisation of the &quot;khâgne&quot; program ==
There are two kinds of &quot;hypokhâgnes&quot;:

1) The &quot;hypokhâgne A/L&quot; which can either lead to a &quot;Khâgne Ulm&quot; or a &quot;Khâgne Lyon&quot;.

2) The &quot;hypokhâgne B/L&quot; which leads to the &quot;Khâgne B/L&quot; only.

There are therefore three kinds of &quot;khâgnes&quot;: &quot;khâgne B/L&quot;, &quot;khâgne Ulm&quot;, and &quot;khâgne Lyon&quot;, respectively preparing to the following entrance exams:

* The entrance examination (A/L section) to the ENS Ulm
* The entrance examination (A/L section) to the ENS of Lyon.
* The entrance examination (B/L section) to the ENS Ulm, the ENS of Lyon and the ENS Paris-Saclay

===Khâgnes de Lettres (Ulm and Lyon)===
The two remaining kinds of khâgnes are literary khâgnes: &quot;khâgne Lyon&quot; and &quot;khâgne Ulm&quot;.

* &quot;Khâgne Ulm&quot; prepares to the &quot;A/L&quot; section of the entrance examination to the ENS of Paris. As the &quot;khâgne B/L&quot;, the particularity of the &quot;khâgne A/L&quot; lies in the fact that curricula of some subjects is unlimited. Each subject of the entrance examination must be taken in a written and in an oral form. The six written subjects taken are given the same coefficient: a codified essay in French literature, in history and in philosophy, a translation from an ancient language, a translation from a modern language and a commentary of it, and a subject taken as a speciality. During the oral entrance examination, the literary analysis of a French literary text, an examination in philosophy, in modern and in ancient languages are based on an unlimited programme, and so is the extension of the curriculum in history. However the examination in the subject taken as a speciality is based on an explicit curriculum. About 2,000 students attend the &quot;khâgne ulm&quot;.
* &quot;Khâgne Lyon&quot;. It prepares to the ENS of Lyon, which is more recent than the ENS Ulm, though it is better ranked in some research departments such as in exact and experimental sciences.
Each subject taught is based on an explicit curriculum which is different each year. Although all subjects have the same importance for the written part of the exam, for the oral examination one or two subjects are strongly emphasized, which makes the entrance examination to the ENS of Lyon more specialized than the one of to the ENS Ulm. 3,000 students are attending the &quot;khâgne Lyon&quot; each year.

For the students of Khâgne Lyon who choose to specialise in English, there is also the possibility of getting into the ENS Paris-Saclay, traditionally a more science-orientated ENS but with an additional 10 places offered to English specialists. The selection process involves a different emphasis put on the grades obtained in the exam for the ENS Lyon and an even more specialised oral exam, which only involves English-related subjects.
Unlike what is commonly assumed, the distinction between &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; opposing the &quot;khâgne Ulm&quot; to the &quot;khâgne Lyon&quot; isn&#x27;t explained by the distinction between classical literature and modern literature, since classical literature is also taught in &quot;khâgne Lyon&quot; and modern literature in &quot;khâgne Ulm&quot;. The distinction is actually made between &quot;classical curriculum&quot; and &quot;modern classical&quot; drawn in 1902 by the Ministry of Public Instruction of the time, Alexandre Ribot. Before 1902, all high school classes were considered &quot;classical&quot;, which means that ancient languages were compulsory even among students majoring in sciences. The reform created &quot;modern&quot; sections in which ancient languages weren&#x27;t compulsory.

All &quot;hypokhâgneux&quot; must attend 5 hours of French literature, 5 hours of history, 4 hours of philosophy, 4 hours of the first modern language, 3 hours of ancient language and cultures (2 hours of Latin or Ancient Greek and 2 hours of antique culture), 2 hours of geography and 2 hours of a second modern language a week. Then comes a chosen subject which can be art, ancient languages, geography or another modern language.
In khâgne, the compulsory subjects and their respective tuition hours depend on the kind of speciality chosen:

* in literature, in philosophy, in history/geography or in geography (explicit curriculum)
* in classical literature (Latin and ancient Greek, ancient history)
* in modern languages (two modern languages are to be studied)
* in arts : musicology, art history, cinematography or theater studies

=== Khâgnes de Lettres et Sciences sociales (B/L) ===
Compared to the khâgne A/L, students of the khâgne de Lettres et Sciences sociales (B/L) (Literature and social sciences) are required to take mathematics and social sciences in addition to literary subjects (philosophy, French literature, history and languages). The khâgne B/L was created in 1983 in Henri-IV and Lakanal high schools at the same time as a corresponding entrance examination was created at the ENS rue d&#x27;Ulm. The goal was to attract good high school students who majored in sciences to literary and social studies.

Both the curriculum of a hypokhâgne and a khâgne B/L is composed of the following subjects, which are considered of equal importance:

* Mathematics (6 hours per week) whose curriculum is similar to the ones of business CPGEs.
* Social sciences (6 hours per week) which encompasses economy, sociology, and objects commonly studied by those two subjects.
* French literature (4 hours per week), unlimited curriculum.
* History (4 hours per week). The curriculum encompasses &quot;World history from 1918 to the present&quot; and &quot;French history from 1870 to the present&quot; and is taught during the two years of the classe prépa.
* Philosophy (4 hours per week), unlimited curriculum.
* A compulsory modern language (2 hours per week)
* An extra option (4 hours per week): extra classes in the compulsory modern language, or another modern language, or an ancient language or geography.
* Sport (2 optional hours per week)

The khâgne B/L prepares students to take the entrance examinations of various schools:
* ENS Ulm (25 places)
* ENS Paris-Saclay (18 places)
* ENS of Lyon (10 places)
* ENSAE (20 places) (National School of Statistics and Economic Administration) attached to France&#x27;s National Institute of Economic and Statistical Information (INSEE)
* the National School for Statistics and Analysis of Information (ENSAI)
* Business schools (ESSEC, HEC, ESCP Business School, EDHEC, École de management de Lyon, Audencia, etc.)
* the French military academy Saint-Cyr
* the national school for archivists and librarians, École nationale des chartes
* Communication schools (IFJ, etc.) and journalism schools (CELSA, etc.)
* Instituts d&#x27;études politiques (IEP, Sciences Po)
* the Engineering school (Management/Advanced mechanics) (ISMANS)

==== University ====
The majority of khâgneux B/L and A/L go on to study at a university once they have completed the khâgne, though an increasing number of khâgneux enroll in grandes écoles such as business schools or engineering schools (ENSAE, ENSAI, etc.). During their studies in classe préparatoire, students are simultaneously enrolled at a university so that the years spent at the classe prépa are recognized by universities: a student having completed the hypokhâgne is allowed to enroll in the second year of university in a chosen subject; a student having completed the khâgne can immediately enter the third and last year of the French bachelor&#x27;s programme in a chosen subject. After having repeated the khâgne, the student may be granted a partial or a total bachelor&#x27;s diploma equivalence. In the case of a student who has passed the written exam but failed the oral part, there is the possibility of studying any subject they have done in the written exam at post-graduate level.
In addition to grandes écoles and IEPs, khâgne students can also enroll in selective university programmes, such as &quot;magistères&quot;.

== History ==
Until 1890, secondary school graduates prepared for the entrance examination to the ENS by repeating their &quot;classe de rhétorique&quot; which corresponds to the final year of secondary education. Teachers would give them more difficult assignments than to high school juniors. Lycée Louis-le-Grand created a special class in order to gather those &quot;veterans&quot;: the &quot;Première supérieure&quot; class, also called &quot;rhétorique supérieure&quot;, or &quot;rhétosup&quot;. Lycée Henri-IV then introduced the &quot;Lettres supérieures&quot; (or &quot;Lettres sup&quot;) year between the final year and the &quot;Première supérieure&quot; year. Regarded as a two-year extension of high school studies, &quot;Lettres supérieures&quot; and &quot;Première supérieure&quot; was meant to prepare students to the ENS. This system became standard by the 1930s.

As the coursework is intensive, with around 35 hours of classwork per week and a good deal of work on top of that, it can be very stressful for students. The examinations are difficult and competitive and it is common for students either to repeat the second year of classes (in slang &quot;cuber&quot;) or to fail altogether, in which case they usually obtain a &quot;Licence&quot; or other qualification. The grading system (0 to 20) reflects the general philosophy of the &quot;khâgnes&quot;: underscoring the failings of the students rather than their strengths. Consequently, most grades hover between 4 and 11, the latter grade being an excellent grade. This grading system is quite demotivating for students but is part and parcel of the intellectual &quot;boot camp&quot; mentality of the &quot;classes prépas&quot; educational system.

The classes involve elements of literature (modern and classical), history, philosophy, geography, languages and linguistics-–-a comprehensive humanities-based education-–-but students will normally specialise in one or two subjects.
Critics claim that a disproportionate amount of resources is devoted to &quot;khâgne&quot; students as against the c. 40% of Baccalauréat students who attend a standard university. They therefore see it as a feature of the elitism of the French higher education system, especially since the majority of successful candidates originate from privileged upper-class and middle-class families. Defenders see it as demonstrating an emphasis on quality.

==Terminology==
=== Etymology ===
The word (f.) is a pseudo-Graecism, derived from the French adjective , meaning &#x27;knock-kneed&#x27;. During the 19th and early 20th century, the adjective was often used mockingly to describe people in the academic strata, especially those pursuing classical studies. More specifically, the was used as a taunt by students of the military academy, whose curriculum included physical education such as equestrianism and fencing, against students in the humanities, who were perceived as crouching over their books, thus developing physical deformities.

In the early 20th century, the term was adapted by humanities students themselves as a mocking self-description but they changed the spelling () to make it look like a Greek loanword.

The play with Greek is even more conspicuous with &quot;hypokhâgne&quot;, the name of the first year. This word was jocularly derived from &quot;khâgne&quot; using the Greek prefix , &#x27;under&#x27;.

=== Slang terms and folklore ===
Students commonly abbreviate the name of their year using acronyms, hence &quot;hypokhâgne&quot; is HK , &quot;khâgne&quot; is just K .

In student slang, a former hypokhâgneux attending the khâgne for the first time is called &quot;carré&quot; (or &quot;khârrés&quot;). A khâgneux who fails the end-of-year entrance examination to ENS may repeat the khâgne year to try their luck a second time; in which case he or she is called &quot;cube&quot; (or &quot;khûbe&quot;). The origin of these terms corresponds to the number of years spent by the student in the system: two years (HK+K) correspond to &quot;carré&quot; (cf. Fr. m² = &quot;mètres carrés&quot; = square meter), three (HK+K+K) to &quot;cube&quot; (cf. m³ = &quot;mètres cubes&quot; = cubic meter).

A khâgneux who repeats the khâgne twice is called &quot;bicarré&quot; (or &quot;bikhârré&quot;), commonly abbreviated as &quot;bica&quot;. So in a classroom of khâgne, half of the students may be &quot;carrés&quot;, a third may be &quot;cubes&quot;, plus a handful of &quot;bicas&quot; who are trying their last chance at the final examination. Using derived verbs, one can say &quot;Je vais cuber.&quot; (meaning &quot;I plan to give khâgne a second try&quot;); or &quot;Je vais quand même pas bicater!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m not going to try a third year in khâgne!&quot;).

*The khâgne is informally discussed in the memoirs of Raymond Aron (1905–1983), who transferred at 17 from a suburban school to Lycée Condorcet in Paris for the two-year khâgne course, and was a classmate at the École Normale Supérieure of Jean-Paul Sartre and Georges Canguilhem. These memoirs (published in English translation in 1990) illustrate the social differences between the education of the intellectual elite in France and in other countries, largely deriving from the unique curriculum and method of the khâgne.
*In &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, Philip Roth details the life story of Delphine Roux, a character who was educated in Lycée Henri-IV&#x27;s khâgne and became a normalienne. He also describes the intellectual life of khâgneux in the Latin Quarter, from the point of view of the main character, Coleman Silk.

<doc id="720739" wikidata="Q926168" url="?curid=720739" title="John So">
<text>John Chun Sai So (, ; born 2 October 1946) is a Hong Kong Australian businessman who served as the 102nd Lord Mayor of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, Australia. He was the first Lord Mayor in the city&#x27;s history to be directly elected by voters; previously, Lord Mayors were elected by the councillors. He is also the first Lord Mayor of Melbourne of Chinese descent.

First elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2004, So is the second-longest-serving Lord Mayor of Melbourne, serving for seven and a half years. In 2006, he won the World Mayor award. On 1 October 2008, So announced that he would not seek re-election for a third term as Lord Mayor. He was succeeded by Robert Doyle.

So currently serves as chairman of the Global Business Council, an international forum established by the World Chinese Economic Forum in Malaysia aimed at facilitating trade between China, India, ASEAN and the Middle East. In December 2013, So was appointed by the Chinese government as a special advisor to the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

==Background==
So was born in British Hong Kong on 2 October 1946. When he was 17 years old, he moved to Melbourne and completed his secondary education at University High School. He then went on to tertiary studies, obtaining a Diploma of Education and Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Melbourne. After graduating, he taught physics at Fitzroy High School. So became a business operator in 1973, with interests across Australia, Hong Kong and Mainland China.

So&#x27;s political career has included positions as director of Asia Society&#x27;s AustralAsia Centre, commissioner of Victoria Ethics Affairs Commission, director of Melbourne Water, honorary member of the World Mayors Council on Climate Change, former executive member of the Committee For Melbourne, president of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Charitable Fund, chairman of the Asia Pacific Racing Carnival and chairman of the Victorian Chinese Welfare Centre.

So is actively involved in Australia&#x27;s major sporting events. He was the number-one ticket holder for the Melbourne Demons football club and number-one ticket holder for the Melbourne Victory soccer club.

===Politics===

In 1991, So contested politics for the first time and was elected as one of the councillors of the City of Melbourne. He was re-elected in 1996 and 1999. In 1999, So came within one vote of being elected Lord Mayor, losing 4–5 to Peter Costigan.

In 2001, the Victorian Government dismissed the Lord Mayor, Deputy Lord Mayor and councillors for ongoing infighting that resulted in the council&#x27;s inability to function. The government immediately reformed the system to give the Lord Mayor a stronger mandate. Under the new system, the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor were to be directly elected by the citizens in a US presidential-style election, as opposed to being elected in-house among the councillors.

==First term as Lord Mayor, 2001–2004==
In the 2001 Lord Mayoral election, So polled 14.9% of the primary vote, second only to Peter Sheppard, who received 15.2%, but after preferences were distributed, So comfortably defeated Sheppard. So also defeated the then-Premier Steve Bracks&#x27;s preferred candidate, Peter McMullin, and former federal minister and Australian Democrats founder Don Chipp.

So presided over a prosperous term in which Melbourne was voted World&#x27;s Most Livable City on more than one occasion. Along with television presenter Livinia Nixon, he was the face of the &quot;That&#x27;s Melbourne&quot; campaign to encourage tourism to the city. He campaigned against crime and was a member of the Police Minister&#x27;s Crime Prevention Council. He also pushed for the federal government to build a national indigenous museum in Melbourne.

So was criticised for his communication skills, partly due to his heavily Cantonese-accented English. A restaurant with ties to So was also fined $75,000 for breaches of the Food Safety Act by his own council. In 2002, So was accused of putting his relationship with the Chinese government ahead of Melbourne by refusing to meet the Dalai Lama during his Australian visit. The council was also punished by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal for prohibiting Falun Gong from participating in the city&#x27;s annual Moomba parade.

==Second term as Lord Mayor, 2004–2008==

===2004 election===
Though he had been a relatively popular mayor, So was widely expected to be defeated at the 2004 election. Despite this, he polled well on election day, achieving 42.2% of the primary vote (compared to his nearest rival who received 9.2%), and was re-elected. So&#x27;s ticket for the Councillor positions was also successful, winning a historic majority in the Town Hall.
===Commonwealth Games===
During the 2006 Commonwealth Games, So was warmly welcomed by Melbourne as a figurehead of the city. This led to &quot;John So, he&#x27;s our bro&#x27;.&quot; T-shirts and &quot;John So for PM&#x27;&quot; shirts and stickers being manufactured and worn by some Melburnians as a testament to the city&#x27;s tolerance and multiculturalism. At the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games, at every mention of So&#x27;s name, there was a tremendous applause from the crowd, which became progressively louder with each occurrence.

===Planning and development===
So presided over a number of major developments throughout his second term. The most significant of these include the refurbishment of the city&#x27;s key shopping complex, the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre; construction of the council&#x27;s second building, Council House 2, the first Six Green Star-rated building in Australia; development, in partnership with the State Government, of the new Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre; and refurbishment of Melbourne&#x27;s key shopping precinct Bourke Street Mall. During So&#x27;s term, the council also regained from the State Government jurisdiction over Melbourne&#x27;s new waterfront, Melbourne Docklands.

===Controversies===
In 2007, So was criticised for redundancies of staff at the Melbourne City Council after an efficiency review found that the council had a A$4.2 million budget discrepancy. So used his casting vote to defeat a &quot;vote of no confidence&quot; by opposition councillors over the incident. Following the vote, opposition councillors stepped up their attack and criticised So for not meeting with the Dalai Lama during the latter&#x27;s 2007 visit, and claimed So had also tried to stop them from meeting the Dalai Lama.

===World Mayor===
So&#x27;s popularity in office resulted in him being named World Mayor for 2006. He won the contest ahead of Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen and Harrisburg Mayor Stephen R. Reed. World Mayor cited, amongst other things, the successful staging of the 2006 Commonwealth Games and So&#x27;s popularity among the young population of Melbourne as a reason for his victory. In its verdict, the judging panel described So as &quot;possibly the first city leader to enjoy &#x27;cult status.

So told the media he was &quot;delighted to be elected&quot; and that &quot;the honour belongs to the amazing people of this wonderful city and the hard-working team at the City of Melbourne&quot;.

==Retirement as Lord Mayor==
Speculation had been rife that So was preparing to stand for the Lord Mayoral election in November 2008. Rumours surfaced that former Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett might be able to challenge So effectively and Kennett confirmed that several Liberal Party members had approached him on this matter. In late September 2008, Kennett announced that he would not run for Lord Mayor.

On 1 October 2008, So officially announced that he would not seek re-election, stating &quot;you can&#x27;t work at 110 percent forever and that is what this job requires.&quot;

==Honours and positions==
In 2006, So was named World Mayor ahead of other candidates including Job Cohen, Ray Nagin, Michael Bloomberg and Shintaro Ishihara.
In 2006, So was among eleven recipients of the You Bring Charm to the World Award, presented at Peking University in Beijing. The award was jointly sponsored by Phoenix Television, Baidu, and Beijing Youth Daily and recognised the achievements of the &quot;most influential Chinese in 2006&quot;.

In 2007, So received an honorary degree of Doctor of the University from Victoria University, in recognition of his services to local government.

In 2010, So was appointed as one of the six panel members of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Council.

In 2011, So was a recipient of the World Chinese Economic Forum Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2013, So was awarded the Sir Edward &#x27;Weary&#x27; Dunlop Asia Medal.

On the Queen&#x27;s Birthday in 2014, So was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for &quot;distinguished service to local government and community relations, as an ambassador for cultural diversity, and to the promotion of Melbourne as a tourist and investment destination&quot;.

So is also a Member of the World Mayors Council on Climate Change.

==Personal life==
So has been married twice and has four children. His partner, Wendy Cheng, served as the Lady Mayoress of Melbourne and chaired the Lady Mayoress&#x27; Committee between 2001 and 2008.

So&#x27;s youngest son, John So Jnr, an investment banker and businessman, ran unsuccessfully to be elected as Deputy Lord Mayor of Melbourne alongside Australia Sotheby&#x27;s CEO, Gary Singer, in the 2012 Melbourne City Council Elections. Singer was previously Deputy Lord Mayor while John So Snr was in office.

So supports the Melbourne Demons in the Australian Football League.

<doc id="720752" wikidata="Q283596" url="?curid=720752" title="Meganeura">
<text>Meganeura is a genus of extinct insects from the Late Carboniferous (approximately 300 million years ago). It is a member of the extinct order Meganisoptera, which are closely related to and resemble dragonflies and damselflies (with dragonflies, damselflies and meganisopterans being part of the broader group Odonatoptera). Like other odonoapterans, they were predatory, with their diet mainly consisting of other insects. The genus belongs to the Meganeuridae, a family including other similarly giant dragonfly-like insects ranging from the Late Carboniferous to Middle Permian. With single wing length reaching and a wingspan about , &quot;M. monyi&quot; is one of the largest-known flying insect species. 
Fossils of &quot;Meganeura&quot; were first discovered in Late Carboniferous (Stephanian) Coal Measures of Commentry, France in 1880. In 1885, French paleontologist Charles Brongniart described and named the fossil &quot;Meganeura&quot; (great-nerved), which refers to the network of veins on the insect&#x27;s wings. Another fine fossil specimen was found in 1979 at Bolsover in Derbyshire. The holotype is housed in the National Museum of Natural History, in Paris. Despite being the iconic &quot;giant dragonfly&quot;, fossils of &quot;Meganeura&quot; are poorly preserved in comparison to other meganeurids.

== Lifestyle ==

Research on close relatives &quot;Meganeurula&quot; and &quot;Meganeurites&quot; suggest that &quot;Meganeura&quot; was adapted to open habitats, and similar in behaviour to extant hawkers. The eyes of &quot;Meganeura&quot; were likely enlarged relative to body size. &quot;Meganeura&quot; had spines on the tibia and tarsi sections of the legs, which would have functioned as a &quot;flying trap&quot; to capture prey. An engineering examination estimated that the mass of the largest specimens with wingspans over 70 cm to be 100 to 150 grams. The analysis also suggested that &quot;Meganeura&quot; would be susceptible to overheating.

Studies indicate that Meganuera&#x27;s typically lived near the edge of bodies of water such as streams and ponds. Furthermore, as carnivores they mainly ate other insects, small amphibians, and vertebrates using their long spine-like legs to grab and hold their prey. 

==Size==
There has been some controversy as to how insects of the Carboniferous period were able to grow so large.
* Oxygen levels and atmospheric density. The way oxygen is diffused through the insect&#x27;s body via its tracheal breathing system puts an upper limit on body size, which prehistoric insects seem to have well exceeded. It was originally proposed by that &quot;Meganeura&quot; was able to fly only because the atmosphere of Earth at that time contained more oxygen than the present 20 percent. This hypothesis was initially dismissed by fellow scientists, but has found approval more recently through further study into the relationship between gigantism and oxygen availability. If this hypothesis is correct, these insects would have been susceptible to falling oxygen levels and certainly could not survive in our modern atmosphere. Other research indicates that insects really do breathe, with &quot;rapid cycles of tracheal compression and expansion&quot;. Recent analysis of the flight energetics of modern insects and birds suggests that both the oxygen levels and air density provide an upper bound on size. The presence of very large Meganeuridae with wing spans rivaling those of &quot;Meganeura&quot; during the Permian, when the oxygen content of the atmosphere was already much lower than in the Carboniferous, presented a problem to the oxygen-related explanations in the case of the giant dragonflies. However, despite the fact that meganeurids had the largest-known wingspans, their bodies were not very heavy, being less massive than those of several living Coleoptera; therefore, they were not true giant insects, only being giant in comparison with their living relatives.
* Lack of predators. Other explanations for the large size of meganeurids compared to living relatives are warranted. suggested that the lack of aerial vertebrate predators allowed pterygote insects to evolve to maximum sizes during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, perhaps accelerated by an evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; for increase in body size between plant-feeding Palaeodictyoptera and Meganisoptera as their predators.
*Aquatic larvae stadium. Another theory suggests that insects that developed in water before becoming terrestrial as adults grew bigger as a way to protect themselves against the high levels of oxygen.

<text>New mysterianism, or commonly just mysterianism, is a philosophical position proposing that the hard problem of consciousness cannot be resolved by humans. The unresolvable problem is how to explain the existence of qualia (individual instances of subjective, conscious experience). In terms of the various schools of philosophy of mind, mysterianism is a form of nonreductive physicalism. Some &quot;mysterians&quot; state their case uncompromisingly (Colin McGinn has said that consciousness is &quot;a mystery that human intelligence will never unravel&quot;); others take a &quot;pseudo-mysterian&quot; stance, being of the belief that consciousness is not within the grasp of &quot;present&quot; human understanding, but may be comprehensible to future advances of science and technology.

==Name==
Owen Flanagan noted in his 1991 book &quot;Science of the Mind&quot; that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness may never be completely explained. Flanagan called them &quot;the new mysterians&quot; after the rock group Question Mark and the Mysterians.
He clarifies this term by stating &quot;But the new mysterianism is a postmodern position designed to drive a railroad spike through the heart of scientism&quot;. The term &quot;new mysterianism&quot; has been extended by some writers to encompass the wider philosophical position that humans do not have the intellectual ability to solve (or comprehend the answers to) many hard problems, not just the problem of consciousness, at a scientific level. This position is also known as anti-constructive naturalism.

According to Flanagan, &quot;The &#x27;old mysterians&#x27; were dualists who thought that consciousness cannot be understood scientifically because it operates according to nonnatural principles and possesses nonnatural properties.&quot; Apparently, some apply the terms to thinkers throughout history who suggested some aspect of consciousness may not be knowable or discoverable, including Gottfried Leibniz, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Huxley. Thomas Huxley wrote, &quot;[H]ow it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djinn, when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.&quot;

==Philosophy==
In the view of the new mysterians, their contention that the hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable is not a presupposition, but rather a philosophical conclusion reached by thinking carefully about the issue. The standard argument is as follows:

Subjective experiences by their very nature cannot be shared or compared side-by-side. Therefore, it is impossible to know what subjective experiences another person is having.

Noam Chomsky distinguishes between &quot;problems&quot;, which seem solvable, at least in principle, through scientific methods, and &quot;mysteries&quot;, which do not seem solvable, even in principle. He notes that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology, e.g. a mouse will never be able to navigate a prime number maze. In the same way, certain problems may be beyond our understanding.

== Adherents ==
===Historical===
* William James, American philosopher, in his essay &quot;Is Life Worth Living?&quot; (1896). James makes the point that much human mental activity (e.g. reading) is forever closed to the mind of a dog, even though we may share the same household and have a deep friendship with each other. So, by analogy, the human mind may be forever closed to certain aspects of the larger universe. This was a concept which James found liberating, and which gave an implicit significance to certain distressing aspects of the human condition. James makes an analogy with the suffering of a dog during a vivisection: the meaning of the vivisection is inaccessible to the dog. But that does not mean that the vivisection is meaningless. So it may be with our suffering in this world.
* Carl Jung, Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, who, in the first chapter of his last work, &quot;Man and His Symbols&quot; (1964), wrote: &quot;...even when our senses react to real phenomena, sights and sounds, they are somehow translated from the realm of reality into that of the mind. Within the mind they become psychic events whose ultimate nature is unknowable (for the psyche cannot know its own psychical substance).&quot;

===Contemporary===
* Colin McGinn is the leading proponent of the new mysterian position among major philosophers.
* Thomas Nagel, American philosopher.
* Jerry Fodor, American philosopher and cognitive scientist.
* Noam Chomsky, American linguist and cognitive scientist, has advanced a mysterian perspective, expressing that: &quot;In brief, if we are biological organisms, not angels, much of what we seek to understand might lie beyond our cognitive limits—maybe a true understanding of anything, as Galileo concluded, and Newton in a certain sense demonstrated. That cognitive reach has limits is not only a truism, but also a fortunate one: if there were no limits to human intelligence, it would lack internal structure, and would therefore have no scope: we could achieve nothing by inquiry.&quot;
* Martin Gardner, American mathematics and science writer, considered himself to be a mysterian.
* John Horgan, American science journalist.
* Steven Pinker, American psychologist; favoured mysterianism in &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, and later wrote: &quot;The brain is a product of evolution, and just as animal brains have their limitations, we have ours. Our brains can&#x27;t hold a hundred numbers in memory, can&#x27;t visualize seven-dimensional space and perhaps can&#x27;t intuitively grasp why neural information processing observed from the outside should give rise to subjective experience on the inside. This is where I place my bet, though I admit that the theory could be demolished when an unborn genius—a Darwin or Einstein of consciousness—comes up with a flabbergasting new idea that suddenly makes it all clear to us.&quot;
* Roger Penrose, English physicist, mathematician and philosopher of science.
* Edward Witten, American string theorist.
* Sam Harris, American neuroscientist, has endorsed mysterianism by stating that &quot;This situation has been characterized as an &#x27;explanatory gap&#x27; and the &#x27;hard problem of consciousness&#x27;, and it is surely both. I am sympathetic with those who, like... McGinn and... Pinker, have judged the impasse to be total: perhaps the emergence of consciousness is simply incomprehensible in human terms.&quot;

== Opponents ==
* Daniel Dennett, American philosopher, who has explicitly attacked McGinn&#x27;s notion of mysterianism.

<doc id="720758" wikidata="Q1397782" url="?curid=720758" title="Faster Pussycat">
<text>Faster Pussycat is an American glam metal band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985 by vocalist Taime Downe, guitarists Greg Steele and Brent Muscat and bassist Kelly Nickels. The group has since gone through numerous lineup changes leaving Downe as the only constant member. They broke up in 1993, but reformed in 2001. Faster Pussycat has released four studio albums to date: &quot;Faster Pussycat&quot; (1987), &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot; (1989), &quot;Whipped!&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Power and the Glory Hole&quot; (2006). They were a successful hard rock band during the late 1980s and early 1990s, having sold over two million records worldwide.

== History ==
=== Early years (1985–1987) ===
Faster Pussycat was formed in Hollywood by Taime Downe during the glam metal and glam punk boom of the 1980s. The earliest incarnation of the band featured Downe and Greg Steele along with Brent Muscat. The name of the band is derived from the Russ Meyer film &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot;.

After multiple early personnel changes, Faster Pussycat consisted of Downe (vocals), Steele (guitar), Muscat (guitar), Kelly Nickels (bass) and Mark Michals (drums).

Just before the band recorded their debut album, Nickels got into a motorcycle accident and broke his leg in seven places. He was replaced by Eric Stacy from Champagne Darling Cool. Shortly thereafter, Nickels joined L.A. Guns.

=== Rise to fame and breakup (1987–1993) ===
In the feeding frenzy of the mid-1980s as labels signed other bands affiliated with the Sunset Strip (like Guns N&#x27; Roses and Poison), Faster Pussycat signed a record contract with Elektra Records, which released their debut album &quot;Faster Pussycat&quot; in 1987. The band established a following among heavy metal, glam rock and sleaze rock fans, mainly through two promotional videos from the first album for the songs &quot;Bathroom Wall&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Change That Song&quot;. In November 1987, the band appeared on the cover of &quot;Screamer Magazine&quot;″s debut issue. In the United States the band toured with Alice Cooper, David Lee Roth and Motörhead in support of the album.

Also in 1987, Faster Pussycat appeared in the rockumentary film &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization part 2 – The Metal Years&quot;. The band was interviewed and performed live versions of &quot;Cathouse&quot; and &quot;Bathroom Wall&quot;.

Two years later, Faster Pussycat recorded their most successful album, &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot;. The album earned &quot;Gold&quot; status from the RIAA. Sales were mainly driven by the hit single &quot;House of Pain&quot;. Music videos were produced for &quot;House of Pain&quot; and &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;. While the band was touring for the album in 1990, drummer Mark Michals was arrested in Omaha, Nebraska and fired from the band after signing for a package of heroin addressed to himself. Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot filled in as drummer for the remainder of the tour, after which Brett Bradshaw became the long-term drummer. Tours with Kiss and Mötley Crüe followed.

In 1990, the band recorded a cover of Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; for a compilation called &quot;Rubáiyát: Elektra&#x27;s 40th Anniversary&quot; and filmed a video. The song was later included on the 1992 &quot;Belted, Buckled And Booted&quot; EP.

In 1992, the band released their third album, &quot;Whipped!&quot;, which peaked at number 90 on the chart.

In 1993, Faster Pussycat parted ways with Stacy and hired Aaron Abellira to replace him. They embarked on a warmup tour, an American tour and then some shows in Japan. Most of the shows were sold out. They also played one last sold-out show in Hollywood at the Hollywood Palace.

A few weeks after returning to the U.S., Faster Pussycat broke up, its members going their separate ways.

Downe was involved with industrial musical act Pigface, before forming his own industrial rock act with Kyle Kyle of Bang Tango called the Newlydeads.

=== Reunion and change of musical style (2001–2005) ===
In 2001, Faster Pussycat reformed with original members Downe (vocals), Muscat (guitar) and Steele (guitar), alongside Downe&#x27;s former Newlydeads bandmates Xristian Simon (guitar), Danny Nordahl (bass) and Chad Stewart (drums). Nordahl had also played in the Throbs, and Nordahl and Chad Stewart also both play in Motochrist.

A remix compilation, &quot;Between the Valley of the Ultra Pussy&quot;, was released the same year, featuring industrial-rock remixes of the band&#x27;s classic tracks, along with a bonus cover of Kiss&#x27;s &quot;I Was Made For Loving You&quot;. However, this divided fans, as many of the older fanbase who enjoyed standard hard rock were not familiar with industrial rock.

Steele left the band halfway through the 2001 headlining reunion tour. Tracii Guns filled in as guitarist for the rest of the tour, after which Faster Pussycat continued as a five-piece. Eric Griffin from Murderdolls, Synical and (later) Wednesday 13 filled in as guitarist for the American tour, as Muscat&#x27;s scheduling conflicts prevented him from participating. Muscat returned briefly, until oral cancer sidelined him in late summer of 2005, and he was temporarily replaced by Michael Thomas, an arrangement that would become permanent when Muscat chose not to return to the lineup.

=== Name dispute and Brent Muscat&#x27;s Faster Pussycat lineup (2006–2007) ===
In December 2006, three former original Faster Pussycat members, Brent Muscat, Eric Stacy and Brett Bradshaw, along with Underground Rebels vocalist Kurt Frohlich and Sin City Sinners guitarist Todd Kerns, began performing under the name Faster Pussycat, creating two versions of the band, both claiming to be the original. Muscat claimed that this was to allow fans to hear Faster Pussycat tracks played the way they were originally recorded, as opposed to the industrial-rock version of the band that he said Downe continued to front. Muscat also made a legal claim to the name Faster Pussycat.

Muscat&#x27;s Faster Pussycat lineup agreed to play the AVN Awards after-party at the Dive Bar in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to a press release, the band—which did not include Downe—would perform &quot;all classic tracks, no remixes, no B.S.&quot;

Downe posted a bulletin on Myspace saying Faster Pussycat was not playing in Las Vegas and that Muscat&#x27;s version was a &quot;tribute band.&quot; Muscat responded that he donated all his earnings from the gig, and planned to donate a portion of any future earnings, to cancer research. In various interviews, Downe disputed Muscat&#x27;s version of events and indicated that the issue was being dealt with via the courts.

In February 2007, Brent issued this statement on his Myspace blog:

In a March 2007 interview with an Italian publication, Muscat stated:

On April 21, 2007, Muscat circulated via Myspace an open invitation to Downe and Steele to reunite, along with Stacy and Bradshaw. There was no response from Downe. Brent&#x27;s version of Faster Pussycat toured Europe in Spring 2007 with Frohlich replacing Downe on vocals along with Kerns on guitar.

In July 2007, Muscat decided to drop the battle to use the name Faster Pussycat, and has since started a band called Sin City Sinners. Brent has stated in an interview that &quot;Faster Pussycat is dead.&quot;

Downe continued with the name Faster Pussycat, performing at Rocklahoma in July 2007. During the band&#x27;s set, Downe went on a tirade, referencing Muscat&#x27;s cancer and stating his wish that Muscat would die, which received a poor reception from both the crowd and journalists. He then cut the set short and left the stage without playing several of the band&#x27;s biggest hits.

=== Recent times (2008–present) ===

Faster Pussycat toured the U.S. in the summer of 2008 with Tracii Guns&#x27; version of LA Guns.

In the late spring of 2010, Ace Von Johnson replaced Michael Thomas, who was devoting his full-time work to Adler&#x27;s Appetite.

In late 2013, Faster Pussycat&#x27;s current lineup went on tour, performing mainly in clubs, bars and university venues. While the band&#x27;s past problems had shrunk their audiences, the 2013 shows received positive reviews.

During an August 15, 2015, performance at the Cathouse, Brent Muscat, Eric Stacy, and Greg Steele from the classic lineup joined Downe and his then-current incarnation of the band on stage to perform &quot;Bathroom Wall&quot; and &quot;Babylon.&quot;

In September 2020, Faster Pussycat posted a picture of themselves in the studio on Facebook, working on what appeared to be new material. In 2022, the band released the single &quot;Like a Ghost&quot; with a b-side cover of Johnny Thunders&#x27; &quot;Pirate Love&quot;.

Former drummer Brett Bradshaw died unexpectedly on March 26, 2021, at age 50.

<text>The York River is a navigable estuary, approximately long, in eastern Virginia in the United States. It ranges in width from at its head to near its mouth on the west side of Chesapeake Bay. Its watershed drains an area of the coastal plain of Virginia north and east of Richmond.

Its banks were inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. In 2003 evidence was found of the likely site of Werowocomoco, one of two capitals used by the paramount chief Powhatan before 1609. The site was inhabited since 1200 as a major village. Enormously important in later U.S. history, the river was also the scene of early settlements of the Virginia Colony. It was the site of significant events and battles in both the American Revolutionary War and the American Civil War.

==Description==

The York River is formed at West Point, approximately east of Richmond, by the confluence of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey rivers. It drains into the Chesapeake Bay towards the southeast, entering the bay approximately east of Yorktown, which sits along its southern shore. U.S. Highway 17 crosses the estuary from Yorktown to Gloucester Point on the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge.

==History== 
The York River was formerly known as the Pamunkey River by the Native Americans. Colonists of the Virginia Company in the 17th century first called it the Charles River. On the north bank (the Middle Peninsula), in what is now Gloucester County, the chief of the Powhatan Confederacy maintained Werowocomoco, one of two capitals of the paramount chiefdom at the time of European contact before 1609. In 2002–2003, archeological evidence was found of an extensive ancient settlement on the York River at Purtan Bay. With excavations since then, researchers have concluded this is likely the site of Werowocomoco. They have found evidence of a large residential village inhabited since 1200 CE, with major earthworks constructed in 1400 CE, more than 200 years prior to the English colonists. In 2006 the &quot;Werowocomoco&quot; Archeological Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Excavations continue by a team from the College of William and Mary, the Virginia Department of Natural History and representatives of Virginia descendant tribes of the Powhatan.
The peninsula formed by the York and the James rivers just to the south became the scene of the end campaign of the American Revolutionary War in October 1781. The British Army under Cornwallis at Yorktown found itself cornered by the Americans under George Washington on land and by the French fleet at sea. The ensuing American victory at the Battle of Yorktown forced the surrender of Cornwallis and the end of the war in the east. During the American Civil War, the same area became the theater of the Peninsular Campaign of 1862.

York River State Park is located along the southern shore northwest of Yorktown in James City County. Also on the south shore are several large military reservations, including Camp Peary and the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown (and Cheatham Annex) of the U.S. Navy. Large areas of preserved wetlands and forest are considered ecologically important to migratory waterfowl. The National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway provides a route through a portion of this natural area between Williamsburg and Yorktown.

==Crossing==

The only vehicular crossing of the York River is the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge, a swing-type drawbridge which carries U.S. Highway 17 between Yorktown and Gloucester Point. The toll bridge, which was rebuilt and expanded in the mid-1990s, collects a $2 toll for automobile traffic; the fee is collected only from northbound drivers. The bridge has been one of the sites of a special program to establish and encourage nesting locations for the peregrine falcon population of Virginia.

<doc id="720778" wikidata="Q1998401" url="?curid=720778" title="North Yemen">
<text>North Yemen () is a term used to describe the Kingdom of Yemen (1918-1962), the Yemen Arab Republic (1962-1990), and the regimes that preceded them and exercised sovereignty over that region of Yemen. Its capital was Sanaa from 1918 to 1948 and again from 1962 to 1990. Located in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, the area of the region is 195,000 square kilometers, it used to have a population of about thirteen million people prior to the Yemeni unification. It was bordered to the north by Saudi Arabia, to the south and east by South Yemen, to the west by the Red Sea, and to Bab al-Mandab in the southwest. 

North Yemen was admitted to the United Nations on September 30, 1947. In 1962, the country fought a bloody civil war that ended with the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of a republic in 1970. It was one of the predecessor states of the Republic of Yemen, alongside South Yemen, until its eventual unification. 

==History==
Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 after the Great War, northern Yemen became an independent state as the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. On September 27, 1962, revolutionaries inspired by the Arab nationalist ideology of United Arab Republic (Egyptian) President Gamal Abdel Nasser deposed the newly crowned King Muhammad al-Badr, took control of Sanaʽa, and established the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). This coup d&#x27;état marked the beginning of the North Yemen Civil War that pitted YAR troops, assisted by the United Arab Republic (Egypt), against Badr&#x27;s royalist forces, supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Conflict continued periodically until 1967, when Egyptian troops were withdrawn to join the conflict of the Six-Day War. By 1968, following a failed royalist siege of Sanaʽa, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation. Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic in 1970.

Unlike East and West Germany or North and South Korea, the YAR and its southern neighbor, the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), also known as South Yemen, remained relatively cordial, though relations were often strained. Following the Yemenite War of 1972, the two nations declared that unification would eventually occur. However, these plans were put on hold due to the Yemenite War of 1979, and war was stopped only by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.

===Politics===

North Yemen was a republic governed nominally under a constitution adopted in 1970, suspended in 1974, and largely restored between 1978 and the late 1980s. Although a succession of bodies carried out some of the functions of a legislature, they exercised little real power until the late 1980s. During that period, policy making remained in the hands of a relatively progressive military elite that worked closely with a variety of civilians that included a large and growing group of technocrats, the major tribal leaders, and other traditional conservative notables. Although political parties were formally banned, several parties did exist and operated with varying degrees of influence during and between elections.

=== Unification ===
In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions. They agreed to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of a national identification card.

Official Yemeni unification took place on May 22, 1990, with a planned, 30-month process, scheduled for completion in November 1992. The first stamp bearing the inscription &quot;Yemen Republic&quot; was issued in October 1990. While government ministries proceeded to merge, both currencies remained valid until June 11, 1996. A civil war in 1994 delayed the completion of the final merger.

<text>William Trevor Cox (24 May 1928 – 20 November 2016), known by his pen name William Trevor, was an Irish novelist, playwright, and short story writer. One of the elder statesmen of the Irish literary world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest contemporary writers of short stories in the English language. Trevor won the Whitbread Prize three times and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize, the last for his novel &quot;Love and Summer&quot; (2009), which was also shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2011. His name was also mentioned in relation to the Nobel Prize in Literature. 

Trevor won the 2008 International Nonino Prize in Italy. In 2014, he was bestowed with the title of Saoi within Aosdána. He resided in England from 1954 until his death in 2016, at the age of 88.

==Biography==
He was born as William Trevor Cox in Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland, to a middle-class, Anglo-Irish Protestant (Church of Ireland) family. He moved several times to other provincial locations, including Skibbereen, Tipperary, Youghal and Enniscorthy, as a result of his father&#x27;s work as a bank official.

He was educated at a succession of schools including St Columba&#x27;s College, Dublin (where he was taught by Oisín Kelly) and at Trinity College Dublin, from which he received a degree in history. Trevor worked as a sculptor under the name Trevor Cox after he graduated from Trinity College, supplementing his income by teaching. 

He married Jane Ryan in 1952 and emigrated to England, working as a teacher, a sculptor and then as a copywriter for an advertising agency. During this time he and his wife had their first son. In 1952 he became an art teacher at Bilton Grange, a prep school near Rugby. Trevor was commissioned to carve reliefs for several churches, including All Saints, Braunston, Northamptonshire. In 1956 he moved to Somerset to work as a sculptor and carried out commissions for churches. He stopped wood carving in 1960. 

His first novel, &quot;A Standard of Behaviour&quot;, was published in 1958 (by Hutchinson of London), but received little critical success. He later disowned this work, and, according to his obituary in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;refused to have it republished&quot;. It was, in fact, republished in 1982 and in 1989.

In 1964, at the age of 36, Trevor was awarded the Hawthornden Prize for &quot;The Old Boys&quot;. This success encouraged Trevor to become a full-time writer.

In 1971, he and his family moved from London to Devon in South West England, first to Dunkeswell, then in 1980 to Shobrooke, where he lived until his death. Despite having spent most of his life in England, he considered himself to be &quot;Irish in every vein&quot;.

William Trevor died peacefully in his sleep on 20 November 2016. He was 88 years old.

==Works and themes==
He wrote several collections of short stories that were well-received. His short stories often follow a Chekhovian pattern. The characters in Trevor&#x27;s work are typically marginalized members of society: children, the elderly, single middle-aged men and women, or the unhappily married. Those who cannot accept the reality of their lives create their own alternative worlds into which they retreat. A number of the stories use Gothic elements to explore the nature of evil and its connection to madness. Trevor acknowledged the influence of James Joyce on his short-story writing, and &quot;the odour of ashpits and old weeds and offal&quot; can be detected in his work, but the overall impression is not of gloominess, since, particularly in his early work, the author&#x27;s wry humour offers the reader a tragicomic version of the world. He adapted much of his work for stage, television and radio. In 1990, &quot;Fools of Fortune&quot; was made into a film directed by Pat O&#x27;Connor, followed by a 1999 film adaptation of &quot;Felicia&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which was directed by Atom Egoyan.

Trevor set his stories in both England and Ireland; they range from black comedies to tales based on Irish history and politics. A common theme is the tension between Protestant (usually Church of Ireland) landowners and Catholic tenants. His early books are peopled by eccentrics who speak in a pedantically formal manner and engage in hilariously comic activities that are recounted by a detached narrative voice. Instead of one central figure, the novels feature several protagonists of equal importance, drawn together by an institutional setting, which acts as a convergence point for their individual stories. The later novels are thematically and technically more complex. The operation of grace in the world is explored, and several narrative voices are used to view the same events from different angles. Unreliable narrators and different perspectives reflect the fragmentation and uncertainty of modern life. Trevor also explored the decaying institution of the &quot;Big House&quot; in his novels &quot;Fools of Fortune&quot; and &quot;The Story of Lucy Gault&quot;. 

==Awards and honours==
Trevor was a member of the Irish Academy of Letters and Aosdána. He was awarded an honorary CBE in 1977 for &quot;services to literature&quot;, and was made a Companion of Literature in 1994. In 2002 he received an honorary KBE in recognition of his services to literature. He won the 2008 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

Trevor was nominated for the Booker Prize five times, making the shortlist in 1970, 1976, 1991 and 2002, and the longlist in 2009. He won the Whitbread Prize three times and the Hawthornden Prize once.

Since 2002, when non-American authors became eligible to compete for the O. Henry Award, Trevor won the award four times, for his stories &quot;Sacred Statues&quot; (2002), &quot;The Dressmaker&#x27;s Child&quot; (2006), &quot;The Room&quot; (2007), a juror favourite of that year, and &quot;Folie à Deux&quot; (2008).

Trevor was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2011.

<text>Francis IV Joseph Charles Ambrose Stanislaus (Italian: &quot;Francesco IV Giuseppe Carlo Ambrogio Stanislao d&#x27;Asburgo-Este&quot;; 6 October 1779 – 21 January 1846) was Duke of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola (from 1815), Duke of Massa and Prince of Carrara (from 1829), Archduke of Austria-Este, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

==Biography==
Francis was born in Milan. His father was Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Austria-Este and Duke of Breisgau, his mother Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este, Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara, who was the last descendant of the House of Este and, through her mother, of the House of Cybo-Malaspina.

He was a grandson of Maria Theresa of Austria, head of the House of Habsburg, and was heir to the Este states through his father, who had been invested with the succession in the imperial fies of the Este by the Perpetual Imperial Diet in 1771, just before his marriage to Maria Beatrice, although he could never actually ascend the throne during the Napoleonic era. Francis&#x27;s mother was not entitled to inherit due to the Salic law in force in Modena and Reggio (but not applied in Massa and Carrara). He thus became the first member of the House of Habsburg-Este to rule the Este inheritance in Northern Italy.

Francis is distinguished for his stern and tyrannic rule by which he repressed all the democratic movements appearing during his reign, particularly following a major revolt in 1830. The harshness of the Ducal policies are illustrated by the hanging of Ciro Menotti for an attempted insurrection against the Duke (1831).

===Family===
In 1812, Francis married his niece the Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy, who was the daughter of his sister Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este and King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia. The couple had four children:

* Maria Theresa (1817–1886), married Henri, comte de Chambord.
* Francis V, Duke of Modena (1819–1875), married Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria.
* Ferdinand Karl (1821–1849), married Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria. Father of Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este.
* Maria Beatrix (1824–1906), married Infante Juan de Bourbon, Count of Montizón.

<text>The Lady of Baza (&quot;la Dama de Baza&quot;) is a famous example of Iberian sculpture by the Bastetani. It is a limestone female figure with traces of painted detail in a stuccoed surface. It is held in Spain&#x27;s National Archaeological Museum.

==Discovery==
It was found on July 22, 1971, by Francisco José Presedo Velo, in Baza, in the Altiplano de Granada, the high tableland in the northeast of the province of Granada. The town of Baza was the site of the Ibero-Roman city of Basti and, in one of its two necropoleis, the Cerro del Santuario, the Lady of Baza was recovered. She is seated in an armchair, and an open space on the side is thought to have contained ashes from a cremation.

==Display==
The sculpture&#x27;s name links it in the popular imagination to its more famous cousin, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot;. After conservation, the sculpture, which dates to the fourth century BCE, joined the enigmatic Lady of Elche deposited in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The chimera &quot;Bicha of Balazote&quot; and the standing Gran Dama Oferente, also called &quot;Dama del Cerro de los Santos&quot;, are exhibited in the same room of the museum.

<doc id="720804" wikidata="Q566247" url="?curid=720804" title="Saxonia (locomotive)">
<text>The locomotive Saxonia was operated by the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company (&quot;Leipzig–Dresdner Eisenbahn-Compagnie&quot; or &quot;LDE&quot;) and was the first practical working steam locomotive built in Germany. Its name means &quot;Saxony&quot; in Latin.

== History ==
The &quot;Saxonia&quot; was built by Johann Andreas Schubert. Schubert had been inspired by the English-built locomotive, &quot;Comet&quot;, procured for the LDE, and he analysed and improved upon what he saw. He used the same dimensions but, unlike Comet, two coupled axles were driven, providing increased tractive force, and a carrying axle was added at the back to improve ride qualities.

The development and construction of the locomotive was carried out in the Maschinenbauanstalt Übigau at Dresden, an engineering works that had been founded on 1 January 1837. From the beginning Schubert was the head of the company. The construction of the engine was a technical and economic risk for the firm. For a start, it had no technical experience at all; furthermore there were no orders for a locomotive.

The &quot;Saxonia&quot; was intended to open the Leipzig–Dresden railway, the first long-distance railway line in Germany, on 8 April 1839. But the English, who until then had a monopoly within the railway industry, begrudged success to Schubert and his locomotive. The first train to run on the railway was hauled by the two English locomotives &quot;Robert Stephenson&quot; and &quot;Elephant&quot;. The &quot;Saxonia&quot; – driven by its creator, Johann Andreas Schubert –- followed on behind.

The &quot;Saxonia&quot; clearly continued to be used successfully, however, because in 1843 it had clocked up . There is no definite information about its whereabouts, however, it must have remained in the LDE&#x27;s fleet until 1856 because its name was not reassigned until then.

The Übigau works built a second locomotive of the same arrangement, named &quot;Phoenix&quot;, delivered 1840-04-12.

== Technical description ==
From a technical standpoint the &quot;Saxonia&quot; reflected in the main its English counterparts. Only a few details exist about the design of the boiler. The boiler barrel had rivetted longitudinal seams, the vertical boiler had a curved, cylindrical top. A flat plate on top of the vertical boiler provided a platform for the steam whistle and spring balance safety valve. On top of the front section of the boiler barrel was the tall, narrow steam dome. The grate was designed to be moveable. 

The steam engine was designed as a two-cylinder inside drive with a simple inside lever valve gear (&quot;Hebelsteurung&quot;) without a steam expansion stage. The engine drove the second coupled axle. 

Both coupled axles as well as the carrying axle were fixed rigidly into the frame. The wheel spokes were made of forged bar steel. Later cast wheel spokes were fitted. Because it had an inside drive the second axle had to be designed as a crank axle, which is remarkable, bearing in mind the manufacturing technology of that time. A technical innovation was the trailing axle which had been intended by Schubert mainly to improve the locomotive&#x27;s riding qualities. It was subsequently determined to be superfluous and was removed in 1840. From 1842, however, the operation of twin-axled locomotives was banned on safety grounds, so the trailing axle had to be refitted. The brake was initially a screw-operated band brake which acted on the two driven wheels from the top. Because this did not prove suitable due to high wear and tear, it was later removed.

== Replica locomotive ==

On 11 October 1985, a working group was established by the East German government&#x27;s Ministry of Transport for the construction of a replica of the locomotive. The aim was for its inaugural journey to form part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the opening of the first German long-distance railway from Leipzig to Dresden on 8 April 1989.

Like the &quot;Adler&quot;, few original design documents existed at that time from which the replica could be built. The basis of the new design drew heavily on a blueprint of the original drawings from 1838. The dimensions and technical data were derived from the book published in 1839 by NNW Meissner. Building a replica using the original manufacturing techniques was not possible. In building the boiler current regulations had to be followed. The steam engine was a major headache. Originally the &quot;Saxonia&quot; only had a simple lever valve gear which did not enable any kind of steam admission control. For the replica &quot;Saxonia&quot; a Stephenson valve gear with open rods was planned.

The design and manufacture of the replica boiler was entrusted to the VEB Dampfkesselbau Übigau in Dresden, which had built the original boiler 150 years earlier. All other components were manufactured by various Deutsche Reichsbahn facilities. The final assembly was carried out at the Halle repair shop (&quot;Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk&quot; or &quot;Raw&quot;). The manufacture of components was taken on by the &quot;Bahnbetriebswerke&quot; (&quot;Bw&quot; i.e. locomotive depot) at Dresden, Oebisfelde, Berlin-Pankow and Weissenfels as well as the refurbishment shop (&quot;Aufarbeitungswerkstatt&quot;) at Wilsdruff.

The tender was built in the facility at Waren (Müritz) of the Neustrelitz &quot;Bw&quot;. Originally a wooden frame made of foreign hardwood was planned, largely as in the original. Trials with a replica buffer beam showed that a wooden construction of that nature had a strong tendency to crack. For that reason the tender frame was made of welded steel with a wood cladding.

On 1 October 1988 the new locomotive was fired up for the first time at &quot;Raw&quot; Halle. 14 days later she demonstrated she was fully operational during a trial run to Eisleben. On her handover journey on 12 January 1989 she even attained a speed of 70 km/h between Halle and Leipzig, as well as demonstrating smooth riding qualities and good steam generation.

The depot at Leipzig Hauptbahnhof Süd was the home stable for the new &quot;Saxonia&quot;. On 8 April 1989 she led the impressive parade of locomotives at Riesa to celebrate the opening of the Germany&#x27;s first long-distance railway. 

The locomotive is owned today by the DB Museum at Nuremberg. It underwent a full inspection in 2008 at the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works and is still fully operational.

<doc id="720805" wikidata="Q297532" url="?curid=720805" title="Roberto Bolaño">
<text>Roberto Bolaño Ávalos (; 28 April 1953 – 15 July 2003) was a Chilean novelist, short-story writer, poet and essayist. In 1999, Bolaño won the Rómulo Gallegos Prize for his novel &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;, and in 2008 he was posthumously awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction for his novel &quot;2666&quot;, which was described by board member Marcela Valdes as a &quot;work so rich and dazzling that it will surely draw readers and scholars for ages&quot;.

Bolaño&#x27;s work is highly regarded by both writers and contemporary literary critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;the most significant Latin American literary voice of his generation&quot; and he has frequently been compared with Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. His books have been translated into numerous languages, including English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, and Dutch.

== Life ==

=== Childhood in Chile ===
Bolaño was born in 1953 in Santiago, the son of a truck driver (who was also a boxer) and a teacher. While he was born in Santiago, he never lived there. Instead, he and his sister spent their early years in southern and coastal Chile, attending primary school in Viña del Mar and later moving to Quilpué and Cauquenes. By his own account, Bolaño was skinny, nearsighted, and bookish. He was dyslexic and was often bullied at school, where he felt like an outsider. He came from a lower-middle-class family, and while his mother was a fan of best-sellers, they were not an intellectual family. He had one younger sister. He was ten when he started his first job, selling bus tickets on the Quilpué-Valparaiso route. He spent the greater part of his childhood living in Los Ángeles, Bío Bío.

=== Youth in Mexico ===
In 1968, Bolaño moved with his family to Mexico City, dropped out of school, worked as a journalist, and became active in left-wing political causes.

=== Brief return to Chile ===
A key episode in Bolaño&#x27;s life, mentioned in different forms in several of his works, occurred in 1973, when he left Mexico for Chile to &quot;help build the revolution&quot; by supporting the democratic socialist government of Salvador Allende. After Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s right-wing military coup against Allende, Bolaño was arrested on suspicion of being a &quot;terrorist&quot; and spent eight days in custody. He was rescued by two former classmates who had become prison guards. Bolaño describes this experience in the story &quot;Dance Card&quot;. According to the version of events he provides in this story, he was not tortured as he had expected, but &quot;in the small hours I could hear them torturing others; I couldn&#x27;t sleep and there was nothing to read except a magazine in English that someone had left behind. The only interesting article in it was about a house that had once belonged to Dylan Thomas... I got out of that hole thanks to a pair of detectives who had been at high school with me.&quot; The episode is also recounted, from the point of view of Bolaño&#x27;s former classmates, in the story &quot;Detectives&quot;. Nevertheless, since 2009, Bolaño&#x27;s Mexican friends from that era have cast doubts on whether he was even in Chile in 1973 at all.

Bolaño had conflicted feelings about his native country. He was notorious in Chile for his fierce attacks on Isabel Allende and other members of the literary establishment. &quot;He didn&#x27;t fit into Chile, and the rejection that he experienced left him free to say whatever he wanted, which can be a good thing for a writer,&quot; commented Chilean-Argentinian novelist and playwright Ariel Dorfman.

=== Return to Mexico ===

On his overland return from Chile to Mexico in 1974, Bolaño allegedly passed an interlude in El Salvador, spent in the company of the poet Roque Dalton and the guerrillas of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, though the veracity of this episode has been cast into doubt.

In the 1960s, Bolaño, an atheist since his youth, became a Trotskyist and in 1975 a founding member of Infrarrealismo (Infrarealism), a minor poetic movement. He affectionately parodied aspects of the movement in &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;.

On his return to Mexico, Bolaño lived as a literary &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and bohemian poet, &quot;a professional provocateur feared at all the publishing houses even though he was a nobody, bursting into literary presentations and readings&quot;, as recalled by his editor Jorge Herralde.

=== Move to Spain ===
Bolaño moved to Europe in 1977, and finally made his way to Spain, where he married and settled on the Mediterranean coast near Barcelona, on the Costa Brava, working as a dishwasher, campground custodian, bellhop, and garbage collector. He used his spare time to write. From the 80&#x27;s to his death, he lived in the small Catalan beach town of Blanes, in the Province of Girona.

Bolaño continued with poetry, before shifting to fiction in his early forties. In an interview Bolaño said that he began writing fiction because he felt responsible for the future financial well-being of his family, which he knew he could never secure from the earnings of a poet. This was confirmed by Jorge Herralde, who explained that Bolaño &quot;abandoned his parsimonious beatnik existence&quot; because the birth of his son in 1990 made him &quot;decide that he was responsible for his family&#x27;s future and that it would be easier to earn a living by writing fiction.&quot; However, he continued to think of himself primarily as a poet, and a collection of his verse, spanning 20 years, was published in 2000 under the title &quot;Los perros románticos&quot; (&quot;The Romantic Dogs&quot;).

=== Declining health and death ===
Bolaño&#x27;s death in 2003 came after a long period of declining health. He experienced liver failure and had been on a liver transplant waiting list while working on &quot;2666&quot;; he was third on the list at the time of his death.

Six weeks before he died, Bolaño&#x27;s fellow Latin American novelists hailed him as the most important figure of his generation at an international conference he attended in Seville. Among his closest friends were the novelists Rodrigo Fresán and Enrique Vila-Matas; Fresán&#x27;s tribute included the statement that &quot;Roberto emerged as a writer at a time when Latin America no longer believed in utopias, when paradise had become hell, and that sense of monstrousness and waking nightmares and constant flight from something horrid permeates &quot;2666&quot; and all his work.&quot; &quot;His books are political,&quot; Fresán also observed, &quot;but in a way that is more personal than militant or demagogic, that is closer to the mystique of the beatniks than the &quot;Boom&quot;.&quot; In Fresán&#x27;s view, he &quot;was one of a kind, a writer who worked without a net, who went all out, with no brakes, and in doing so, created a new way to be a great Latin American writer.&quot; Larry Rohter of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Bolaño joked about the &#x27;posthumous&#x27;, saying the word &#x27;sounds like the name of a Roman gladiator, one who is undefeated,&#x27; and he would no doubt be amused to see how his stock has risen now that he is dead.&quot; He died of liver failure in the Vall d&#x27;Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona on 15 July 2003.

Bolaño was survived by his Spanish wife, Carolina López, and their two children, whom he once called &quot;my only motherland&quot;. In his last interview, published by the Mexican edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, Bolaño said he regarded himself as a Latin American, adding that &quot;my only country is my two children and wife and perhaps, though in second place, some moments, streets, faces or books that are in me, and which one day I will forget...&quot;

== Works ==

Although known for his novels and short stories, Bolaño was a prolific poet of free verse and prose poems. Bolaño saw himself primarily as a poet, as a character states in &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;, &quot;Poetry is more than enough for me, although sooner or later I&#x27;m bound to commit the vulgarity of writing stories.&quot;

In rapid succession, he published a series of critically acclaimed works, the most important of which are the novel &quot;Los detectives salvajes&quot; (&quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;), the novella &quot;Nocturno de Chile&quot; (&quot;By Night in Chile&quot;), and, posthumously, the novel &quot;2666&quot;. His two collections of short stories &quot;Llamadas telefónicas&quot; and &quot;Putas asesinas&quot; were awarded literary prizes. In 2009 a number of unpublished novels were discovered among the author&#x27;s papers.

=== Novels and novellas ===

==== &quot;The Skating Rink&quot; ====
&quot;The Skating Rink&quot; (&quot;La pista de hielo&quot; in Spanish) is set in the seaside town of Z, on the Costa Brava, north of Barcelona and is told by three male narrators while revolving around a beautiful figure-skating champion, Nuria Martí. When she is suddenly dropped from the Olympic team, a pompous but besotted civil servant secretly builds a skating rink in a local ruin of a mansion, using public funds. But Nuria has affairs, provokes jealousy, and the skating rink becomes a crime scene.

==== &quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot; ====
&quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot; (&quot;La literatura Nazi en América&quot; in Spanish) is an entirely fictitious, ironic encyclopedia of fascist Latin American and American writers and critics, blinded to their own mediocrity and sparse readership by passionate self-mythification. While this is a risk that literature generally runs in Bolaño&#x27;s works, these characters stand out by force of the intended heinousness of their political philosophy. Published in 1996, the events of the book take place from the late 19th century up to 2029. The last portrait was expanded into a novel in &quot;Distant Star&quot;.

==== &quot;Distant Star&quot; ====
&quot;Distant Star&quot; (&quot;Estrella distante&quot; in Spanish) is a novella nested in the politics of the Pinochet regime, concerned with murder, photography and even poetry blazed across the sky by the smoke of air force planes. This dark satirical work deals with the history of Chilean politics in a morbid and sometimes humorous fashion.

==== &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; ====
&quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; (&quot;Los detectives salvajes&quot; in Spanish) has been compared by Jorge Edwards to Julio Cortázar&#x27;s &quot;Rayuela&quot; and José Lezama Lima&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot;.

In a review in &quot;El País&quot;, the Spanish critic and former literary editor of said newspaper Ignacio Echevarría declared it &quot;the novel that Borges would have written.&quot; (Bolaño often expressed his love for Borges and Cortázar&#x27;s work, and once concluded an overview of contemporary Argentinian literature by saying that &quot;one should read Borges more.&quot;) &quot;Bolaño&#x27;s genius is not just the extraordinary quality of his writing, but also that he does not conform to the paradigm of the Latin American writer&quot;, said Echeverría. &quot;His writing is neither magical realism, nor baroque nor localist, but an imaginary, extraterritorial mirror of Latin America, more as a kind of state of mind than a specific place.&quot;

The central section of &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; presents a long, fragmentary series of reports about the trips and adventures of Arturo Belano, a consonantly named alter-ego of Bolaño, who also appears in other stories &amp; novels, and Ulises Lima, between 1976 and 1996. These trips and adventures, narrated by 52 characters, take them from Mexico City to Israel, Paris, Barcelona, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vienna and finally to Liberia during its civil war in the mid-nineties. The reports are sandwiched at the beginning and end of the novel by the story of their quest to find Cesárea Tinajero, the founder of &quot;real visceralismo&quot;, a Mexican avant-garde literary movement of the twenties, set in late 1975 and early 1976, and narrated by the aspiring 17-year-old poet García Madero, who tells us first about the poetic and social scene around the new &quot;visceral realists&quot; and later closes the novel with his account of their escape from Mexico City to the state of Sonora. Bolaño called &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; &quot;a love letter to my generation.&quot;

==== &quot;Amulet&quot; ====
&quot;Amulet&quot; (&quot;Amuleto&quot; in Spanish) focuses on the Uruguayan poet Auxilio Lacouture, who also appears in &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; as a minor character trapped in a bathroom at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) in Mexico City for two weeks while the army storms the school. In this short novel, she runs across a host of Latin American artists and writers, among them Arturo Belano, Bolaño&#x27;s alter ego. Unlike &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;, &quot;Amulet&quot; stays in Auxilio&#x27;s first-person voice, while still allowing for the frenetic scattering of personalities Bolaño is known for.

==== &quot;By Night in Chile&quot; ====
&quot;By Night in Chile&quot; (&quot;Nocturno de Chile&quot; in Spanish), is a narrative constructed as the loose, uneditorialised deathbed rantings of a Chilean Opus Dei priest and failed poet, Sebastián Urrutia Lacroix. At a crucial point in his career, Father Urrutia is approached by two agents of Opus Dei, who inform him that he has been chosen to visit Europe to study the preservation of old churches – the perfect job for a cleric with artistic sensitivities.

On his arrival, he is told that the major threat to European cathedrals is pigeon droppings, and that his Old World counterparts have devised a clever solution to the problem. They have become falconers, and in town after town he watches as the priests&#x27; hawks viciously dispatch flocks of harmless birds. Chillingly, the Jesuit&#x27;s failure to protest against this bloody means of architectural preservation signals to his employers that he will serve as a passive accomplice to the predatory and brutal methods of the Pinochet regime. This is the beginning of Bolano&#x27;s indictment of &quot;l&#x27;homme intellectuel&quot; (&quot;intellectual man&quot;) who retreats into art, using aestheticism as a cloak and shield while the world lies around him, nauseatingly unchanged, perennially unjust and cruel. This book represents Bolaño&#x27;s views upon returning to Chile and finding a haven for the consolidation of power structures and human rights violations. It is important to note that this book was originally going to be called &quot;Tormenta de Mierda&quot; (&quot;Shit Storm&quot; in English) but was convinced by Jorge Herralde and Juan Villoro to change the name.

==== &quot;Antwerp&quot; ====
&quot;Antwerp&quot; is considered by his literary executor Ignacio Echevarría to be the big bang of the Bolaño universe. The loose prose-poem novel was written in 1980 when Bolaño was 27; the book remained unpublished until 2002, when it was published in Spanish as &quot;Amberes&quot;, a year before the author&#x27;s death. It contains a loose narrative structured less around a story arc and more around motifs, reappearing characters and anecdotes, many of which went on to become common material for Bolaño: crimes and campgrounds, drifters and poetry, sex and love, corrupt cops and misfits. The back of the first New Directions edition of the book contains a quote from Bolaño about &quot;Antwerp&quot;: &quot;The only novel that doesn&#x27;t embarrass me is &quot;Antwerp&quot;.&quot;

==== &quot;2666&quot; ====
&quot;2666&quot; was published in 2004, reportedly as a first draft submitted to his publisher after his death. The text of &quot;2666&quot; was the major preoccupation of the last five years of his life when he was facing death from liver problems. At more than 1,100 pages (898 pages in the English-language edition), the novel is divided into five &quot;parts&quot;. Focused on the mostly unsolved and still ongoing serial murders of the fictional Santa Teresa (based on Ciudad Juárez), &quot;2666&quot; depicts the horror of the 20th century through a wide cast of characters, including police officers, journalists, criminals, and four academics on a quest to find the secretive, Pynchonesque German writer Benno von Archimboldi—who also resembles Bolaño himself. In 2008, the book won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. The award was accepted by Natasha Wimmer, the book&#x27;s translator. In March 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that an additional Part 6 of &quot;2666&quot; was among papers found by researchers going through Bolaño&#x27;s literary estate.

==== &quot;The Third Reich&quot; ====
&quot;The Third Reich&quot; (&quot;El Tercer Reich&quot; in Spanish) was written in 1989 but only discovered among Bolaño&#x27;s papers after he died. It was published in Spanish in 2010 and in English in 2011. The protagonist is Udo Berger, a German war-game champion. With his girlfriend Ingeborg he goes back to the small town on the Costa Brava where he spent his childhood summers. He plays a game of &quot;Rise and Decline of the Third Reich&quot; with a stranger.

==== &quot;Woes of the True Policeman&quot; ====
&quot;Woes of the True Policeman&quot; (&quot;Los sinsabores del verdadero policía&quot; in Spanish) was first published in Spanish in 2011 and in English in 2012. The novel has been described as offering readers plot lines and characters that supplement or propose variations on Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;2666&quot;. It was begun in the 1980s but remained a work-in-progress until his death.

==== &quot;The Spirit of Science Fiction&quot; ====
&quot;The Spirit of Science Fiction&quot; (&quot;El espíritu de la ciencia-ficción&quot; in Spanish) was completed by Bolaño in approximately 1984. It was published posthumously in Spanish in 2016 and in English in 2019. The novel is seen by many as an ur-text to &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot;, &quot;populated with precursory character sketches and situations&quot; and centering on the activities of young poets and writers living in Mexico City.

=== Short story collections ===

==== &quot;Last Evenings on Earth&quot; ====
&quot;Last Evenings on Earth&quot; (From &quot;Llamadas telefónicas&quot; and &quot;Putas Asesinas&quot; in Spanish) is a collection of fourteen short stories narrated by a host of different voices primarily in the first person. A number are narrated by an author, &quot;B.&quot;, who is – in a move typical of the author – a stand-in for the author himself.

==== &quot;The Return&quot; ====
&quot;The Return&quot; is a collection of twelve short stories, first published in English in 2010, and translated by Chris Andrews. It includes the stories from Spanish-language collections &quot;Llamadas Telefonicas&quot; and &quot;Putas Asesinas&quot; not published in &quot;Last Evenings on Earth&quot;.

==== &quot;The Insufferable Gaucho&quot; ====
&quot;The Insufferable Gaucho&quot; (&quot;El gaucho insufrible&quot; in Spanish) collects a disparate variety of work. It contains five short stories and two essays, with the title story inspired by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short story The South, said story being mentioned in Bolaño&#x27;s work.

==== &quot;The Secret of Evil&quot; ====
&quot;The Secret of Evil&quot; (&quot;El secreto del mal&quot; in Spanish) is a collection of short stories and recollections or essays. The Spanish version was published in 2007 and contains 21 pieces, 19 of which appear in the English edition, published in 2010. Several of the stories in the collection feature characters that have appeared in previous works by Bolaño, including his alter ego Arturo Belano and characters that first appeared in &quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot;.

=== Poems ===

==== &quot;The Romantic Dogs&quot; ====
&quot;The Romantic Dogs&quot; (&quot;Los perros románticos&quot; in Spanish), published in 2006, is his first collection of poetry to be translated into English, appearing in a bilingual edition in 2008 under New Directions and translated by Laura Healy. Bolaño has stated that he considered himself first and foremost a poet and took up fiction writing primarily later in life in order to support his children.

==== &quot;The Unknown University&quot; ====
A deluxe edition of Bolaño&#x27;s complete poetry, &quot;The Unknown University&quot;, was translated from Spanish by Laura Healy (Chile, New Directions, 2013). It was shortlisted for the 2014 Best Translated Book Award.

== Themes ==
In the final decade of his life, Bolaño produced a significant body of work, consisting of short stories and novels. In his fiction, the characters are often novelists or poets, some of them aspiring and others famous, and writers appear ubiquitous in Bolaño&#x27;s world, variously cast as heroes, villains, detectives, and iconoclasts.

Other significant themes of his work include quests, &quot;the myth of poetry&quot;, the &quot;interrelationship of poetry and crime&quot;, the inescapable violence of modern life in Latin America, and the essential human business of youth, love, and death.

In one of his stories, &quot;Dentist&quot;, Bolaño appears to set out his basic aesthetic principles. The narrator pays a visit to an old friend, a dentist. The friend introduces him to a poor Indian boy who turns out to be a literary genius. At one point during a long evening of inebriated conversation, the dentist expresses what he believes to be the essence of art:
That&#x27;s what art is, he said, the story of a life in all its particularity. It&#x27;s the only thing that really is particular and personal. It&#x27;s the expression and, at the same time, the fabric of the particular. And what do you mean by the fabric of the particular? I asked, supposing he would answer: Art. I was also thinking, indulgently, that we were pretty drunk already and that it was time to go home. But my friend said: What I mean is the secret story...The secret story is the one we&#x27;ll never know, although we&#x27;re living it from day to day, thinking we&#x27;re alive, thinking we&#x27;ve got it all under control and the stuff we overlook doesn&#x27;t matter. But every damn thing matters! It&#x27;s just that we don&#x27;t realize. We tell ourselves that art runs on one track and life, our lives, on another, we don&#x27;t even realize that&#x27;s a lie.
Like large parts of Bolaño&#x27;s work, this conception of fiction manages to be at once elusive and powerfully suggestive. As Jonathan Lethem has commented, &quot;Reading Roberto Bolaño is like hearing the secret story, being shown the fabric of the particular, watching the tracks of art and life merge at the horizon and linger there like a dream from which we awake inspired to look more attentively at the world.&quot;

When discussing the nature of literature, including his own, Bolaño emphasized its inherent political qualities. He wrote, &quot;All literature, in a certain sense, is political. I mean, first, it&#x27;s a reflection on politics, and second, it&#x27;s also a political program. The former alludes to reality—to the nightmare or benevolent dream that we call reality—which ends, in both cases, with death and the obliteration not only of literature, but of time. The latter refers to the small bits and pieces that survive, that persist; and to reason.&quot;

Bolaño&#x27;s writings repeatedly manifest a concern with the nature and purpose of literature and its relationship to life. One recent assessment of his works discusses his idea of literary culture as a &quot;whore&quot;:
Among the many acid pleasures of the work of Roberto Bolaño, who died at 50 in 2003, is his idea that culture, in particular literary culture, is a whore. In the face of political repression, upheaval and danger, writers continue to swoon over the written word, and this, for Bolaño, is the source both of nobility and of pitch-black humor. In his novel &quot;The Savage Detectives,&quot; two avid young Latino poets never lose faith in their rarefied art no matter the vicissitudes of life, age and politics. If they are sometimes ridiculous, they are always heroic. But what can it mean, he asks us and himself, in his dark, extraordinary, stinging novella &quot;By Night in Chile,&quot; that the intellectual elite can write poetry, paint and discuss the finer points of avant-garde theater as the junta tortures people in basements? The word has no national loyalty, no fundamental political bent; it&#x27;s a genie that can be summoned by any would-be master. Part of Bolaño&#x27;s genius is to ask, via ironies so sharp you can cut your hands on his pages, if we perhaps find a too-easy comfort in art, if we use it as anesthetic, excuse and hide-out in a world that is very busy doing very real things to very real human beings. Is it courageous to read Plato during a military coup or is it something else?

—Stacey D&#x27;Erasmo, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, 24 February 2008
Nazism and fascism is a recurring theme across Bolaño&#x27;s work, most notably in &quot;Nazi Literature in the Americas&quot; and &quot;The Third Reich&quot;. Critic Jacob Silverman described the use of Nazism in Bolaño&#x27;s work as &quot;a kind of shadow text that runs throughout his work, showing how the narcissism of power has much in common with the narcissism of authorship.&quot; From this lens, Bolaño&#x27;s ambitious young authors in exile could be seen as a foil to the foiled ambition of Nazis in exile: &quot;the malignance of ambition as well as the morally treacherous choice that some of Bolaño’s generation made, throwing their lot in with Augusto Pinochet.&quot;

== Translations ==

At the time of his death, Bolaño had 37 publishing contracts in ten countries. Posthumously, the list grew to include more countries, including the United States, and amounted to 50 contracts and 49 translations in twelve countries, all of them prior to the publication of &quot;2666&quot;. 
Bolaño&#x27;s first American publisher, Barbara Epler of New Directions, read a galley proof of &quot;By Night in Chile&quot; and decided to acquire it, along with &quot;Distant Star&quot; and &quot;Last Evenings on Earth&quot;, all translated by Chris Andrews. &quot;By Night in Chile&quot; came out in 2003 and was highly praised by Susan Sontag; at the same time, Bolaño&#x27;s work also began appearing in various magazines, which gained him broader recognition among English readers. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; first published a Bolaño short story, &quot;Gómez Palacio&quot;, in its 8 August 2005 issue.

By 2006, Bolaño&#x27;s rights were represented by Carmen Balcells, who decided to have his two most famous books, &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; and &quot;2666&quot;, reissued by a larger publishing house; both were eventually published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (&quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; in 2007 and &quot;2666&quot; in 2008) in a translation by Natasha Wimmer. At the same time, New Directions took on the publication of the rest of Bolaño&#x27;s work (to the extent that it was known at the time) for a total of 13 books, translated by Laura Healy (two poetry collections), Natasha Wimmer (&quot;Antwerp&quot; and &quot;Between Parentheses&quot;) and Chris Andrews (six novels and three short story collections).

The posthumous discovery of additional works by Bolaño has thus far led to the publication of the novel &quot;The Third Reich&quot; (&quot;El Tercer Reich&quot; in Spanish), (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011, translated by Wimmer) and &quot;The Secret of Evil&quot; (&quot;El Secreto del Mal&quot;), (New Directions, 2012, translated by Wimmer and Andrews), a collection of short stories. A translation of the novel &quot;Woes of the True Policeman&quot; (&quot;Los sinsabores del verdadero policía&quot; in Spanish), (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, translated by Wimmer) was released on 13 November 2012. A collection of three novellas, &quot;Cowboy Graves&quot; (&quot;Sepulcros de vaqueros&quot; in Spanish), (Penguin Press, translated by Wimmer), was released on 16 February 2021.

In 2024, Bolaño&#x27;s North American print and e-book rights were acquired by Farrar, Straus and Giroux which announced plans to reprint a large portion of Bolaño&#x27;s catalog in English under the imprint Picador in June 2024, beginning with &quot;By Night in Chile&quot;, &quot;The Return&quot;, and &quot;Antwerp&quot;.

<text>William Walker (May 6, 1809 – September 24, 1875) was an American Baptist song leader, shape note &quot;singing master&quot;, and compiler of four shape note tunebooks, most notable of which are the influential &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot; and &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot;, which has been in continuous use (republished 2010).

== Life ==

Walker was born in Martin&#x27;s Mills (near Cross Keys), South Carolina, and grew up near Spartanburg. From an early age he became deeply involved in music and became a song leader in the Baptist church. To distinguish him from other William Walkers in Spartanburg, he was nicknamed Singing Billy.

He married Amy Golightly in 1832 and they lived in Spartanburg. Her sister Thurza had married Benjamin Franklin White in 1825; while is clear that there was strife between the two brothers-in-law, there is no evidence for the claim, sometimes heard among Sacred Harp singers, that B.F. White helped Walker compile the &quot;Southern Harmony,&quot; only to be cheated of authorship rights when it was finally published. In 1842 the Whites moved from Spartanburg District, SC to Harris County, Georgia, and in 1844 B. F. White, in concert with Elisha J. King published &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;.

Walker died in Spartanburg in 1875. Walker is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina.

== Tunebooks ==

Walker learned shape note music in singing schools; it had been used by Baptist and Methodist preachers in the Second Great Awakening to help spread Christianity in the South. Because the music could be read and sung by amateurs, hymns in shape note annotation became the centerpiece of many revivals and camp meetings on the frontier. Walker composed his first piece of music at the age of 18.

In 1835, Walker published a tunebook entitled &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot;, a compilation of hymns using the four-shape shape note system of notation. This collection was revised in 1840, 1847 and 1854. In 1846 he issued &quot;The Southern and Western Pocket Harmonist&quot;. Intended as an appendix to the &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;, the &quot;Pocket Harmonist&quot; contains numerous camp-meeting songs with their refrains.

After the Civil War, Walker published a tunebook entitled &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot; (1867), in which he adopted a seven-shape notation. He incorporated over half of the contents of &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot; into the &quot;Christian Harmony&quot;, adding alto parts to those pieces which had lacked them. For the additional three shapes, Walker devised his own system - an inverted key-stone for &quot;do&quot;, a quarter-moon for &quot;re&quot;, and an isosceles triangle for &quot;si&quot; (or &quot;ti&quot;). Walker issued an expanded edition of &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; in 1873. In the same year, he published a collection of Sunday school songs entitled &quot;Fruits and Flowers.&quot;

== As composer ==

Walker is listed as the composer of many of the tunes in &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot;. But, he acknowledged that in many cases, he borrowed his tunes, probably from the living tradition of folk music that surrounded him. Glenn C. Wilcox (references below) describes the process as follows, quoting from Walker&#x27;s own introduction:

In working from original tune to finished hymn, Walker borrowed lyrics from established poets such as Charles Wesley (a common practice in his tradition), who had set many of his works to music earlier. Walker added treble (upper) part and bass parts, to create three-part harmony.

== Legacy ==

Two of Walker&#x27;s tunebooks remain in print. Facsimiles of his &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; (1854 edition) continue in use at an annual singing in Benton, Kentucky. Until 2010, Walker&#x27;s &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; existed in two editions: a facsimile reprint of the 1873 edition, and a revision by O.A. Parris and John Deason first published in 1958, employing the more familiar note-shapes of Jesse B. Aikin.

In 2010, a combined version of the &quot;Christian Harmony&quot;, known as the &quot;Georgia Christian Harmony&quot; or the &quot;Christian Harmony 2010&quot;, was published, using Aikin&#x27;s shape-note system. The &quot;Christian Harmony 2010&quot; incorporated the entire contents of both the 1873 edition and the 1958 Deason-Parris edition, plus a number of new songs.

Walker&#x27;s compositions and arrangements are widely sung today by Sacred Harp singers as well as others. His work is represented by 13 songs in the current 1991 &quot;Denson&quot; edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, and by 12 in the &quot;Cooper&quot; edition. According to the collated minutes kept by the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association, his song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is sung more frequently at Sacred Harp conventions than is any other. The Walker songs are generally sung in four-part versions, with alto parts that were added by early 20th-century composers.

== Representation in other media ==
* Charles Faulkner Bryan composed the music of folk opera &quot;Singin&#x27; Billy&quot; (1952), base on a libretto by Donald Davidson and featuring Walker as the main figure. The opera incorporates five hymns from &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;.
* Donald Grantham incorporated several tunes from Walker&#x27;s &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; in his 1998 &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;, a work for wind band.
* The first &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; All-Day Singing in Europe took place on Sunday, 27 October 2013 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Primrose Hill, London. The event was hosted by the Sacred Harp Singers of London, who regularly sing from Walker&#x27;s &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; (2010). In attendance were Sacred Harp singers from the UK &amp; Ireland, Europe, and the US.

<doc id="720834" wikidata="Q3945628" url="?curid=720834" title="IDF Caterpillar D9">
<text>The IDF Caterpillar D9 — nicknamed &quot;Doobi&quot; (, for teddy bear) — is a Caterpillar D9 armored bulldozer used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is supplied by Caterpillar Inc. and modified by the Israel Defense Forces, Israeli Military Industries and Israel Aerospace Industries to increase the survivability of the bulldozer in hostile environments and enable it to withstand attack.

In the 1980s the IDF began modifying D9 bulldozers to incorporate armour. The bulldozers can also be fitted with weaponry: machine guns and grenade launchers. There are various models, including a remote controlled version.

Over the course of numerous campaigns, IDF bulldozers have been used to demolish thousands of Palestinian homes in Gaza, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless. The Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights has advised Caterpillar Inc. that by supplying the bulldozers to the IDF it may be complicit in human rights violations.

The IDF Caterpillar D9 is operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Combat Engineering Corps essentially for combat engineering operations. It has been involved in incidents of civilian deaths, including the 2003 killing of activist Rachel Corrie and civilians sheltering outside the Kamal Adwan Hospital reported in 2023 and 2024 during the Israel–Hamas war.

==Characteristics==
The D9R, the latest generation of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers in IDF service, has a power of and drawbar pull of 71.6 metric tons (about 702 kN). Older generations, such as D9L and D9N are still in service, mainly in the reserve forces. The D9 has a crew of two: operator and commander. It is operated by the TZAMA (In = ציוד מכני הנדסי, mechanical engineering equipment) units of the Combat Engineering Corps.

In some cases the bulldozers have been fitted with machine guns and grenade launchers.

The IDF uses the D9 for a wide variety of combat engineering tasks, such as earthworks, digging moats, mounting sand barriers, building fortifications, rescuing stuck, overturned or damaged armored fighting vehicles (along with the M88 Recovery Vehicle), clearing land mines, detonating IEDs and explosives, handling booby traps, clearing terrain obstacles and opening routes to armored fighting vehicles and infantry, as well as structures demolition, including under fire.

==History==

Caterpillar Inc. introduced the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer in 1954 and it quickly found its way to civilian engineering in Israel and from there it was recruited to military service by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

===Earlier use===
Unarmored D9 bulldozers were used in the Sinai War (1956), Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973) and the 1982 Lebanon War (1982).

During the 1982 Lebanon War D9s were employed in breaching and paving ways through mountains and fields in the mountain landscape of southern Lebanon. The D9s also cleared minefields and explosive belly charges set on the main routes by Syrian army and Palestinian insurgents. Because the D9 served as front-line tools, the IDF developed armor kits to protect the lives of the soldiers operating them.

===The Second Intifada===

Armored D9 bulldozers were used during the Second Intifada (2000–2005), a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. They were used to open safe routes to IDF forces and detonate explosive charges planted by Palestinian militants. The bulldozers were used extensively to clear shrubbery and structures which were used as cover for Palestinian attacks. In addition they razed houses of families of suicide bombers.

Over 3,000 homes in Palestine were demolished by Israel during the conflict, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless. The destruction of Palestinian homes promoted protests. In one such protest in Rafah in 2003 a group of eight people tried to stop a D9 bulldozer from demolishing a family home. The operator of the bulldozer drove over one of the protesters, Rachel Corrie. She died as a result of her injuries.

Following several incidents where armed Palestinians barricaded themselves inside houses and killed soldiers attempting to breach the entries, the IDF developed &quot;Nohal Sir Lachatz&quot; (נוהל סיר לחץ &quot;pressure cooker procedure&quot;) in which D9s and other engineering vehicles were used to bring them out by razing the houses; most of them surrendered because of fear of being buried alive.

During the 2002 Battle of Jenin armored D9 bulldozers cleared booby traps and improvised explosive devices, and eventually razed houses from which militants fired upon Israeli soldiers or contained possible IEDs and booby traps. A translated interview with one of the drivers was published by Gush Shalom. After the deadly ambush in which 13 soldiers were killed, D9 bulldozers razed the center of the Jenin refugee camp and forced the remaining Palestinian fighters to surrender, thus finishing the battle with an Israeli victory.

===D9R and early 21st century===
During the early 2000s, the new D9R entered IDF service, equipped with a new generation armor designed by the IDF&#x27;s MASHA (, lit. Restoration and Maintenance Center), Israel Aerospace Industries and Zoko Shiloovim/ITE (Caterpillar Inc. importers in Israel). Due to the increasing threat of shaped charge anti-tank rockets and anti-tank missile, the IDF introduced in 2005 a slat armor, installed in large numbers on the IDF D9R dozers in 2006. The slat armor proved to be effective and life-saving; its developers and installers won the IDF&#x27;s Ground Command award.

The IDF also operates armored remote-controlled D9N bulldozers, called &quot;Raam HaShachar&quot; (, lit. &quot;thunder of dawn&quot;) often incorrectly referred as &quot;black thunder&quot;. The remote-controlled bulldozer has been used to clear mines. They were used in the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and the Gaza War (2008–2009).

Armored D9R bulldozers took part in the effort to extinguish 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire. The armored bulldozers opened routes to fire trucks and fire fighters into the heart of the fire. They also created fire breaks by clearing shrubbery and pushing up soil barriers in order to prevent the fire from spreading. They also helped extinguish fires by burying them in dirt and soil.

=== Gaza War (2008–2009) ===
In total, 100 D9s were deployed during the Gaza War (2008–2009), dubbed &#x27;Operation Cast Lead&#x27; by Israel. The war led to extensive destruction in Gaza, especially of Palestinian homes; Israeli bulldozers and anti-tank mines were commonly used. According to Amnesty International:
In March 2009, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that the IDF intended to increase its use of unmanned D9 bulldozers, doubling the number it had. The following year Israel&#x27;s Channel 2 reported that Caterpillar would delay the delivery of D9 bulldozers to the IDF while an investigation into the killing of Rachel Corrie took place.

===2014 Gaza War===

IDF D9 armored bulldozers took major role in the 2014 Gaza War, both in defensive missions and offensive maneuvers. The D9s assisted other heavy equipment such as excavators and drillers in exposing and destroying cross-border underground tunnels penetrating into Israel, more than 30 of these tunnels were destroyed during the operation. The reserve mechanical engineering equipment (צמ&quot;ה) and bulldozers battalion of the Central Command received a citation of recommendation (צל&quot;ש, tzalash) from the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces.

D9s participated in the ground offensive, opening routes to tanks and infantry forces, and demolishing structures that were used by Palestinian militants. On July 27, one D9 was hit by an anti-tank missile, killing its operator and wounding its commander. Another D9 demolished the building from which the missile was launched, killing 8 militants and capturing two more. The crew received a citation of recommendation (צל&quot;ש, tzalash) for their action.

===D9T Panda===

In 2018 the Israel Defense Forces Combat Engineering Corps started to deploy and operate the &quot;Panda&quot; – a remote-controlled version of an armored Caterpillar D9T bulldozer. In 2018, Israel Aerospace Industries announced that it had signed a contract to equip the IDF with more D9T Panda dozers. In 2022-2023 the Panda entered regular service with the IDF.

In 2019, Elbit Systems was awarded an IMOD contract to install the Iron Fist active protection system on the IDF&#x27;s armored D9 bulldozers, to give them extra protection from anti-tank missiles.

===Israel–Hamas war===
During the Israel–Hamas war D9 Bulldozers were deployed on the ground offensive into Gaza where it was used to clear routes for ground forces to manoeuvre and expose shafts of Hamas combat tunnels. According to &quot;The Independent&quot; around 100 D9 bulldozers were expected to be used in the opening stage of the war. On 16 December the IDF captured the Kamal Adwan Hospital; in doing so IDF bulldozers crushed people who had been sheltering outside the hospital.

An investigation by CNN published in January 2024 used satellite imagery to identify sixteen burial grounds in Gaza that had been desecrated by the IDF using bulldozers to level cemeteries and dig up bodies. Later that month Ynet reported that the IDF would buy a further 100 bulldozers. A shipment of 134 bulldozers had not arrived by November. Bulldozers were also used in the deliberate destruction of Gaza&#x27;s environment, with an estimated 38–48% of Gaza&#x27;s farmland and tree cover destroyed by Israel&#x27;s military. Norwegian pension fund Kommunal Landspensjonskasse stopped investing in Caterpillar due to the use of its products by the IDF.

==Models in IDF service==
==Criticism==

Caterpillar&#x27;s sales of D9 bulldozers to the Israeli military for use in the occupied Palestinian territories has long drawn criticism from human rights groups, society groups and responsible investment monitors.

Amnesty International released a report in May 2004 on home demolition in the occupied Palestinian territories in May 2004 that noted the risk of complicity for Caterpillar in human rights violations. The Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights sent a letter to the company the next month warning that by selling bulldozers to the IDF Caterpillar may be complicit in human rights violations, specifically the right to food as the bulldozers were used to destroy Palestinian farms. Human Rights Watch reported the same year on the systematic use of D9 bulldozers in illegal demolitions throughout the occupied territories and called on Caterpillar to suspend its sales to Israel, citing the company&#x27;s own code of conduct.

The punitive destruction of Palestinian homes has been described as a form of collective punishment, and in the view of Human Rights Watch may be considered a war crime.

The pro-Palestinian group Jewish Voice for Peace and four Roman Catholic orders of nuns planned to introduce a resolution at a Caterpillar shareholder meeting subsequent to the human rights reports asking for an investigation into whether Israel&#x27;s use of the company&#x27;s bulldozer to destroy Palestinian homes conformed with the company&#x27;s code of business conduct. In response, the pro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs urged its members to buy Caterpillar stock and to write letters of support to the company.

The US investment indexer MSCI removed Caterpillar from three of its indexes for socially responsible investments in 2012, citing the Israeli military’s use of its bulldozers in the Palestinian territories. In 2017, documents emerged that showed Caterpillar had hired private investigators to spy on the family of Rachel Corrie, the American human rights activist who was killed by a D9 bulldozer in Rafah in early 2003. In 2022, the Palestinian non-governmental organization Stop the Wall called Caterpillar, alongside Hyundai Heavy Industries, JCB and Volvo Group, complicit in what they referred to as Israel&#x27;s ethnic cleansing of the occupied Palestinian territories through the use of its equipment in the demolition of eight Palestinian villages in Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank.

<doc id="720840" wikidata="Q4119595" url="?curid=720840" title="Abdul-Karim Al-Iryani">
<text>Abdul Karim Ali Al-Iryani (; ‎; 12 October 1934 – 8November 2015; also spelled Al-Eryani) was a Yemeni politician who served as the Prime Minister of Yemen from 29 April 1998 to 31March 2001. Al-Iryani, along with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, was the Secretary General of the General People&#x27;s Congress (GPC).

==Early life and education==
Born in Iryan, a village in the central highlands of Ibb, in 1934, Al-Iryani belonged to a prominent family that had held government posts in the region for centuries; many of his ancestors and relatives were judges. He studied in the United States, receiving a Bachelor of Science in agriculture from the University of Georgia in 1962, a Master of Science in agriculture from the same institution in 1964, and a PhD in Biochemical Genetics from Yale University in 1968.

==Career==
Before Yemen&#x27;s unification, Al-Iryani served in the government of North Yemen as Minister of Development (1974–1976), Minister of Education (1976–1978), Prime Minister (1980–1983), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1984–1990). Following unification in 1990, Al-Iryani continued to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs for the united Republic of Yemen until 1993, when he became Minister of Development. In 1994 he served as deputy Prime Minister of Yemen and Minister of Foreign Affairs until 1997. Al-Iryani was appointed as Prime Minister after Faraj Said Bin Ghanem abruptly resigned on 29 April 1998. He served in this capacity until 31 March 2001, when he was succeeded by Abdul Qadir Bajamal.

==Main Accomplishments==
- Banned imports of fruits and vegetables which resulted in a self-sufficient production of such commodities saving hard currency and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in agriculture and trade.

- Introduced tens of state-building laws including multi-party system and democracy.

- Played a major role in the negotiation during the reunification process of South and North Yemen. (and was named the architect of the Yemen reunification)

- Convinced the UN Security Council to abolish the scheme of seceding the southern governorates from the united Yemen during the 1994 civil war.

- Opposed an eminent armed conflict with Eritrea when the latter took over the Yemeni island of Hanish in the red sea. He then led the Yemen team in an international court which ruled for the return of the island to Yemen.

- Furiously fought against corruption and in support of women&#x27;s and human rights.

==Later life and death==
Al-Iryani was a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, a non-profit organisation set up in 2004 by FW de Klerk to support good governance and reduce conflict around the world. He has been credited with brokering the Arab Spring peace negotiations in 2012, resulting in a transition plan for President Saleh to resign.

Al-Iryani died on 8 November 2015 in Frankfurt. Mustapha Noman, a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, called him &quot;the last statesman Yemen had, and will have, for another generation.&quot;

<doc id="720851" wikidata="Q269698" url="?curid=720851" title="Marilyn Burns">
<text>Marilyn Burns (born Mary Lynn Ann Burns; May 7, 1949 – August 5, 2014) was an American actress. She was known for playing Sally Hardesty in Tobe Hooper&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), which established her as a scream queen and a catalyst of the final girl trope. She was involved in two more films of its resulting franchise: a cameo in &quot;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (1995) and a supporting role in &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; (2013). In 2009, she was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame at the Phoenix Film Festival. 

While in college, Burns made her film debut as a tour guide in Robert Altman&#x27;s experimental comedy film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970). She went on to play Linda Kasabian in the true crime television film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (1976), and appear in Hooper&#x27;s horror film &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1977) and the science fiction film &quot;Future-Kill&quot; (1985), the latter of which was written by her &quot;Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; co-star Edwin Neal. Her final film, &quot;In a Madman&#x27;s World&quot; (2017), was posthumously released.

Burns was found dead in her home on August 5, 2014. 

==Early life==
Mary Lynn Ann Burns was born on May 7, 1949 in Erie, Pennsylvania, and was raised in Houston, Texas, where she resided for most of her life. While in the seventh grade, she appeared in a musical production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. She attended the University of Texas at Austin, and graduated with a drama degree in 1971.

== Career ==
In 1970, she made her first film appearance in Robert Altman&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970). Burns was cast in the leading role of the drama film &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot; (1974)—having received the script and been costumed. However, for the established actors Anthony Perkins, Blythe Danner and Beau Bridges to appear, they wanted newcomer Susan Sarandon to be cast in the role instead. Burns got to remain a part of the production as a stand-in for Blythe and Sarandon. She also helped cast some of the extras in George Roy Hill&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975).In 1974, Burns starred in Tobe Hooper&#x27;s independent horror film &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. She plays the character of Sally Hardesty, a teenager who travels with her brother and some friends to the cemetery where her grandfather is buried to investigate reports of grave vandalism, and then encounters a family of cannibals including the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface.

Burns and Hooper had previously met during the production of &quot;Lovin&#x27; Molly&quot; the previous year. When a casting call was held, she auditioned and was given the lead role. The film was produced with a budget of $80,000–$140,000. Burns had performed several of her stunts herself, and she, along with other cast members, had sustained several injuries throughout production. In an article for &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; detailing the production of the film, John Bloom reported that Burns had &quot;been poked, prodded, bound, dragged through rooms, jerked around, chased through cocklebur underbrush, jabbed with a stick, forced to skid on her knees in take after take, pounded on the head with a rubber hammer, coated with sticky stage blood, and endlessly pursued by Hansen with his chain saw and Neal with his constantly flicking switchblade.&quot;

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was released to major critical and commercial success. The film grossed an excess of $30 million and became the 12th highest-grossing film of its year, and was the most successful independent feature until it was overtaken by &quot;Halloween&quot; in 1978. Writing for &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, Donald B. Berrigan stated that Burns &quot;deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Burns&#x27;s performance first on their list of the &quot;10 Greatest Female Performances in Horror Film History&quot;, writing that she &quot;is so convincing in her work as the mentally broken Sally that the audience can’t help but be left shaken and deeply disturbed by the time the end credits roll.&quot; The acting of Burns has continued to earn praise from critics and audiences, and established her as a scream queen and a popular culture icon.

In 1976, Burns had a role in the television miniseries &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; about the real-life trial of Charles Manson and his &quot;family&quot;. In the series, she played Linda Kasabian, a member of the Manson family who was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony against the defendants. Recalling her memories of working on &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, Burns said: &quot;It was a great experience, but nobody really wanted to touch it [due to the subject matter]. It was like, &#x27;Who wants to be in that picture? Who&#x27;s actually gonna do &quot;that&quot; picture?&#x27;&quot; The miniseries was acclaimed and nominated for three Emmy Awards. 

Following her roles in &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, Burns sporadically worked in acting. She played Faye in the horror film &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1977), where she reunited with director Tobe Hooper, and subsequently starred in the films &quot;Kiss Daddy Goodbye&quot; (1981) and &quot;Future-Kill&quot; (1985). 

Burns briefly reprises the role of Sally Hardesty in &quot;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (1995), which was directed by Kim Henkel. Her cameo was made in order to establish &quot;an emotional connection between the Sally character and the Jenny character, a kind of perverse passing of the torch&quot;. She was set to reprise the role of Sally Hardesty once more in the 2003 remake film of the same name, where she would play an aged-up Sally, however this idea was ultimately scrapped. At the 2009 Phoenix Film Festival, Burns was inducted into the horror hall of fame. 

In 2012, Burns made a special appearance in the Kim Henkel-written feature &quot;Butcher Boys&quot;, which is often deemed a &quot;spiritual sequel&quot; to &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. In 2011, Burns was cast in the slasher film &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; as Verna Carson; it was released on January 4, 2013, and marks her last appearance in &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; franchise. Her final film roles include Beulah Standifier in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Sacrament&quot;, and Ms. Hill in the independent feature &quot;In a Madman&#x27;s World&quot;, which was released posthumously in 2017.

==Death==
On August 5, 2014, at the age of 65, Burns was found dead by her brother Bill at her home in Houston. Her cause of death was not specified.

<doc id="720879" wikidata="Q759432" url="?curid=720879" title="Itsy Bitsy Spider">
<text>&quot;The Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot; (also known as &quot;The Incy Wincy Spider&quot; in Australia, Great Britain, and other anglophone countries) is a popular nursery rhyme, folksong, and fingerplay that describes the adventures of a spider as it ascends, descends, and re-ascends the downspout or &quot;waterspout&quot; of a gutter system or open-air reservoir. It is usually accompanied by a sequence of gestures that mimic the words of the song. Its Roud Folk Song Index number is 11586.

==Lyrics==
A commonly used version uses these words and gestures:
Other versions exist.

== Sources ==
The song can be found in publications including an alternative version in the book, &quot;Camp and Camino in Lower California&quot; (1910), where it is referred to as [the classic] &quot;Spider Song&quot;. It appears to be a different version of this song using &quot;blooming, bloody&quot; instead of &quot;itsy bitsy&quot;. It was later published in one of its several modern versions in &quot;Western Folklore&quot;, by the California Folklore Society (1948), Mike and Peggy Seeger&#x27;s, &quot;American Folk Songs for Children&quot; (1948).

Lyrics as described in 1910 as being from the &#x27;classic&#x27; &quot;Spider Song&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Oh, the blooming, bloody spider went up the spider web,
The blooming, bloody rain came down and washed the spider out,
The blooming, bloody sun came out and dried up all the rain,
And the blooming, bloody spider came up the web again.&lt;/poem&gt;

A slightly earlier version recorded in 1909 in Indiana recorded from a college commencement more closely resembles the most common modern version:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;There was a blooming spider
Went up a blooming spout
And down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain
But that bloody blooming son of a gun
Went up that spout again &lt;/poem&gt;

The song is sung by and for children in countless languages and cultures. It is similar to the melodies of the children&#x27;s songs &quot;Sweetly Sings the Donkey&quot; in the United States, and &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ich bin ein kleiner Esel&quot; (the German-language version of &quot;Sweetly Sings the Donkey&quot;) and &quot;&quot; in German-speaking countries.

<text>is a Japanese term that is used in many Japanese martial arts as an honorific title for expert or senior instructors. It can be translated as &quot;master instructor&quot;.

The use of the term is specific to a school or organization, as is the process of becoming a shihan. In aikido, the title &quot;shihan&quot; often is granted to teachers when they reach 6th dan. It is sometimes associated with certain rights, such as the right to give out black belt (&quot;dan&quot;) ranks. However, the title is distinct from the black belt ranking system ( &quot;dan&#x27;i&quot;).

<doc id="720902" wikidata="Q706716" url="?curid=720902" title="Compulsory sterilization">
<text>Compulsory sterilization, also known as forced or coerced sterilization, refers to any government-mandated program to involuntarily sterilize a specific group of people. Sterilization removes a person&#x27;s capacity to reproduce, and is usually done by surgical or chemical means. 

Purported justifications for compulsory sterilization have included population control, eugenics, limiting the spread of HIV, and ethnic genocide. 

Several countries implemented sterilization programs in the early 20th century. Although such programs have been made illegal in much of the world, instances of forced or coerced sterilizations still persist.

==Affected populations==

Governmental family-planning programs emerged in the late 1800s, and have continued to progress through the 21st century. During this time, feminists began advocating for reproductive choice, but eugenicists and hygienists were advocating for low-income and disabled peoples to be sterilized or have their fertility tightly regulated, in order to &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; nations. The second half of the 20th century saw national governments&#x27; uptake of neo-Malthusian ideology that directly linked population growth to increased (and uncontrollable) poverty, which, during the embrace of capitalism, meant that countries were unable to economically develop due to this poverty.

Much of these governmental population control programs were focused on using sterilization as the main avenue to reduce high birth rates, even though public acknowledgement that sterilization made an impact on the population levels of the developing world is still widely lacking. Early population programs of the 20th century were marked as part of the eugenics movement, with Nazi Germany&#x27;s programs providing the most well-known examples of sterilization of disabled people. In the 1970s, population control programs focused on the &quot;third world&quot; to help curtail over population of poverty areas that were beginning to &quot;develop&quot; (Duden 1992).

As of 2013, 24 countries in Europe required sterilization for legal gender recognition and 16 countries did not provide for any possibility to change legal gender at all, which meant that transgender people could have challenges applying for jobs, opening bank accounts, boarding planes, or may not be able to do these things at all. Disabled women in Europe are also common targets of forced sterilization. &quot;&#x27;So many times, you hear it’s in the best interest of the woman,&#x27; said Catalina Devandas Aguilar, a former United Nations special rapporteur for disability rights. &#x27;But often, it’s because it’s more convenient for the family or the institution that takes care of them.&#x27;&quot;

On 1 February 2013, &quot;United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture (SRT) issued a report on abusive practices in health care settings that has important implications for LGBT people and people with intersex conditions&quot; and: In section 88, the SRT says States should:

In May 2014, the World Health Organization, OHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNICEF issued a joint statement on &quot;Eliminating forced, coercive, and otherwise involuntary sterilization&quot;. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* Women, especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with HIV, indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face &quot;wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity&quot;.
** In the United States the funding of mothers on welfare by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughly 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of mothers on welfare. Threats to cease welfare occur when women are hesitant to consent.
* Disabled people, especially those with intellectual disability. Women with intellectual disabilities are &quot;often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices&quot;. Other rationales include menstrual management for &quot;women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses.&quot; Men with intellectual disabilities are also sterilized, sometimes using the justification that it provides greater sexual freedom.
* Intersex persons, who &quot;are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved&quot;, often as a &quot;sex-normalizing&quot; treatment.
* Transgender persons, &quot;as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes&quot;. This being a practice that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has described as a violation of the Yogyakarta Principles.

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, and ensuring non-discrimination, accountability, and access to remedies. Scholars have also emphasized the importance of including the voices and stories of those that have been affected.

== As a part of human population planning ==
Human population planning is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population&#x27;s birth rate, usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, religious reasons, and overpopulation. While population planning can involve measures that improve people&#x27;s lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.

In the 1977 textbook &quot;Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment&quot;, authors Paul and Anne Ehrlich, and John Holdren discuss a variety of means to address human overpopulation, including the possibility of compulsory sterilization. This book received renewed media attention with the appointment of Holdren as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, largely from conservative pundits who have published scans of the textbook online. Several forms of compulsory sterilization are mentioned, including the proposal for vasectomies for men with three or more children in India in the 1960s, sterilizing women after the birth of their second or third child, birth control implants as a form of removable, long-term sterilization, a licensing system allotting a certain number of children per woman, economic and quota systems of having a certain number of children, and adding a sterilant to drinking water or food sources, although the authors are clear that no such sterilant exists nor is one in development. The authors state that most of these policies are not in practice, have not been tried, and most will likely &quot;remain unacceptable to most societies.&quot;

Holdren stated in his confirmation hearing that he no longer supports the creation of an optimum population by the U.S. government. However, the population control policies suggested in the book are indicative of the concerns about overpopulation, also discussed in &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; a book written by Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich predicting major societal upheavals due to overpopulation. As this concern about overpopulation gained political, economic, and social currency, attempts to reduce fertility rates, often through compulsory sterilization, were results of this drive to reduce overpopulation. These coercive and abusive population control policies impacted people around the world in different ways, and continue to have social, health, and political consequences, one of which is lasting mistrust in current family planning initiatives by populations who were subjected to coercive policies like forced sterilization. Population control policies were widely critiqued by women&#x27;s health movement in the 1980s and 1990s, with the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 in Cairo initiating a shift from population control to reproductive rights and the contemporary reproductive justice movement. However, new forms of population control policies, including coercive sterilization practices are a global issue and a reproductive rights and justice issue.

==By country==

=== International law ===
The Istanbul Convention prohibits forced sterilization in most European countries (Article 39).
Widespread or systematic forced sterilization has been recognized as a Crime against Humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in the explanatory memorandum. This memorandum defines the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. It does not have universal jurisdiction, with the United States, Russia and China among the countries to exclude themselves. Rebecca Lee wrote in the Berkeley Journal of International Law that, , twenty-one Council of Europe member states require proof of sterilization in order to change one&#x27;s legal sex categorization. Lee wrote that requiring sterilization is a human rights violation and that LGBTQ-specific international treaties may need to be developed in order to protect LGBTQ human rights.

=== Bangladesh ===

==== Poverty ====
Bangladesh has a long-running government-operated civilian sterilization program as a part of its population control policy, which targets mainly poor women and men. The government offers 2,000 Bangladeshi Taka (US$18) for women who are persuaded to undergo tubal ligation and for men who are persuaded to undergo vasectomy. Women are also offered a sari and men are offered a kurta to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (US$2.70).

In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600–1,000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 IUDs, which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average. A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.

One study conducted in 1977, when incentives were only equivalent to US$1.10 (at that time), indicated that between 40% and 60% of the men chose vasectomy because of the payment, who otherwise did not have any serious urge to get sterilized.

The &quot;Bangladesh Association for Voluntary Sterilization&quot;, alone performed 67,000 tubal ligations and vasectomies in its 25 clinics in 1982. The rate of sterilization increased 25 percent each year.

On 16 December 1982, Bangladesh&#x27;s military ruler Lieutenant General Hussain Muhammad Ershad launched a two-year mass sterilization program for Bangladeshi women and men. About 3,000 women and men were planned to be sterilized on 16 December 1982 (the opening day). Ershad&#x27;s government trained 1,200 doctors and 25,000 field workers who must conduct two tubal ligations and two vasectomies each month to earn their salaries. The government wanted to persuade 1.4 million people, both women and men to undergo sterilization within two years. One population control expert called it &#x27;the largest sterilization program in the world&#x27;. By January 1983, 40,000 government field workers were employed in Bangladesh&#x27;s 65,000 villages to persuade women and men to undergo sterilization and to promote usage of birth-control across the country.

Food subsidies under the group feeding program (VGF) were given to only those women with certificates showing that they had undergone tubal ligation.

There are reports that often when a woman had to undergo a gastrointestinal surgery, doctors took this opportunity to sterilize her without her knowledge. According to Bangladesh governmental website &quot;National Emergency Service&quot;, the 2000 Bangladeshi Taka (US$24) and the sari/lungi given to the persons undergoing sterilizations are their &quot;compensations&quot;. Where Bangladesh government also assures the poor people that it will cover all medical expenses if complications arise after the sterilization.

For the women who are persuaded to have IUD inserted into uterus, the government also offers 150 Bangladeshi Taka (US$1.80) after the procedure and 80+80+80=240 Bangladeshi Taka (0.96+0.96+0.96=2.88 USD) in three followups, where the referrer gets 50 Bangladeshi Taka (US$0.60). And for the women who are persuaded to have etonogestrel birth control implant placed under the skin in upper arm, the government offers 150 Bangladeshi Taka (US$1.80) after the procedure and 70+70+70=210 Bangladeshi Taka (0.84+0.84+0.84=2.52 USD) in three followups, where the referrer gets 60 Bangladeshi Taka (US$0.72).
===== Complications =====
In the 1977 study, a one-year follow-up of 585 men sterilized at vasectomy camps in Shibpur and Shalna in rural Bangladesh showed that almost half of the men were dissatisfied with their vasectomies.

58% of the men said their ability to work had decreased in the last year. 2–7% of the men said their sexual performance decreases. 30.6% of the Shibpur and 18.9% of the Shalna men experienced severe pain during the vasectomy. The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.

According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least two days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and dizziness arose after the sterilization.

The person&#x27;s sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of sedatives administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to respiratory arrest caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints. Centers performing fewer than 200 procedures were associated with more complaints.

According to another study based on 20 sterilization-attributable deaths in Dacca (now Dhaka) and Rajshahi Divisions in Bangladesh, from 1 January 1979, to 31 March 1980, overall, the sterilization-attributable death-to-case rate was 21.3 deaths/100,000 sterilizations. The death rate for vasectomy was 1.6 times higher than that for tubal ligation. Anesthesia overdosage was the leading cause of death following tubal ligation along with tetanus (24%), where intraperitoneal hemorrhage (14%), and infection other than tetanus (5%) was other leading causes of death.

Two women (10%) died from pulmonary embolism after tubal ligation; one (5%) died from each of the following: anaphylaxis from anti-tetanus serum, heat stroke, small bowel obstruction, and aspiration of vomitus. All seven men died from scrotal infections after vasectomy.

According to a second epidemiologic investigation of deaths attributable to sterilization in Bangladesh, where all deaths resulting from sterilizations performed nationwide between 16 September 1980 and 15 April 1981, were investigated and analyzed, nineteen deaths from tubal ligation were attributed to 153,032 sterilizations (both tubal ligation and vasectomy), for an overall death-to-case rate of 12.4 deaths per 100,000 sterilizations. This rate was lower than that (21.3) for sterilizations performed in Dacca (now Dhaka) and Rajshahi Divisions from 1 January 1979 to 31 March 1980, although this difference was not statistically significant. Anesthesia overdosage, tetanus, and hemorrhage (bleeding) were the leading causes of death.

===== Backers =====
These civilian sterilization programs are funded by the countries from northern Europe and the United States. World bank is also known to have sponsored these civilian exploitative sterilization programs in Bangladesh. Historically, World Bank is known to have pressured 3rd World governments to implement population control programs.

Bangladesh has the highest population density in the world among the countries having at least 10 million people. The capital Dhaka is the 4th most densely populated city in the world, which ranked as the world&#x27;s 2nd most unlivable city, just behind Damascus, Syria, according to the annual &quot;Liveability Ranking&quot; 2015 by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

==== Rohingya ====
Bangladesh is planning to introduce a sterilization program in its overcrowded Rohingya refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Rakhine state, Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them. My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in Rakhine). We don&#x27;t have to worry to feed them.

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide vasectomies for men and tubectomies (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 Rohingya refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 Bangladeshis undergo sterilization routinely under the government&#x27;s sterilization program in the border district of Cox&#x27;s Bazar, where the Rohingya refugee Muslims have taken shelter.

=== Brazil ===
During the 1970s–80s, the U.S. government sponsored family planning campaigns in Brazil, although sterilization was illegal at the time there. Dalsgaard examined sterilization practices in Brazil; analyzing the choices of women who opt for this type of reproductive healthcare in order to prevent future pregnancies and so they can accurately plan their families. While many women choose this form of contraception, there are many societal factors that impact this decision, such as poor economic circumstances, low rates of employment, and Catholic religious mandates that stipulate sterilization as less harmful than abortion.

An important case in the legal history of compulsory sterilization in Brazil is the 2018 São Paulo case. Prosecutors filed to have a mother of eight forcibly sterilized after she was arrested on charges of drug trafficking. This motion was justified by the mother&#x27;s poverty, substance abuse disorder, and inability to care for her children, and the judge ruled in favor of sterilization. The surgery was carried out, reportedly against the woman&#x27;s will. Legal experts discussing the case have stated the sterilization of a woman in Brazil is legal when determined absolutely necessary, but it is not clear what qualifies as necessary.

=== Canada ===

===China===
In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the one-child policy. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002. These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, accusations have been raised from groups such as Amnesty International, who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota. These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level.

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, &quot;Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.&quot; This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.

The policy requires a &quot;social compensation fee&quot; for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich. But after 2016, the country has allowed parents to give birth to two children. In 2017, the government offered to surgically remove the IUDs that had been implanted in women to force them to adhere to the one child policy, if they qualified to have a second child. The removal of these long used IUDs is a major surgery and many women are not informed of the risks that are associated with the surgery, such as bleeding, infection, and removal of the uterus.

==== Xinjiang ====
Beginning in 2019, reports of forced sterilization in Xinjiang began to surface. In 2020, public reporting continued to indicate that large-scale compulsory sterilization was being carried out. While national sterilization rates have fallen since the passing of the two child policy in 2016, there has been a sharp increase in the amount of sterilizations in Xinjiang. Many of these surgeries have been forced according to reports, but this is difficult to confirm due to the closed off nature of the area. These measures have sometimes been characterised as part of an ongoing Uyghur genocide in the province.

=== Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic ===
Czechoslovakia carried out a policy to sterilize Romani women, starting in 1973 continuing through the Velvet Revolution of 1989. In some cases, the sterilization was in exchange for social welfare benefits, and the people who were affected were given written agreements which described what was to be done to them, but which they were unable to read due to their illiteracy. The dissidents of the Charter 77 movement denounced these practices in 1977–78 as a genocide. A 2005 report by the Czech government&#x27;s independent ombudsman, Otakar Motejl, identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several healthcare workers and administrators.

Beginning 2012 undergoing sterilization is a requirement for change of name and/or gender markers on official documents for all transgender people in Czechia. In May 2024 the constitutional court found the laws requiring sterilization to be in violation of EU human rights laws. The court established a deadline of June 2025 where the current government is to draft replacement laws.

=== Colombia ===
The time period of 1964–1970 started Colombia&#x27;s population policy development, including the foundation of PROFAMILIA and through the Ministry of Health the family planning program promoted the use of IUDs, the Pill, and sterilization as the main avenues for contraception. By 2005, Colombia had one of the world&#x27;s highest contraceptive usage rates at 76.9%, with female sterilization being the highest percentage of use at just over 30% (second highest is the IUD at around 12% and the pill around 10%) (Measham and Lopez-Escobar 2007). In Colombia during the 1980s, sterilization was the second most popular choice of pregnancy prevention (after the Pill), and public healthcare organizations and funders (USAID, AVSC, IPPF) supported sterilization as a way to decrease abortions rates. While not directly forced into sterilization, women of lower socio-economic standing had significantly less options to afford family planning care as sterilizations were subsidized.

===Denmark===
11,000 people were sterilized in Denmark from 1929–67, about half were sterilized against their will. The forced sterilization program was &quot;mainly was directed at people who were mentally handicapped&quot; because of the popularity of eugenics at the time in Denmark. During the 1960s and 1970s, thousands of Greenlandic Inuit women and girls had IUDs placed without their consent. The birth rate in Greenland was reduced by around 50%. In 2022, Denmark and Greenland agreed to hold a two-year investigation into the program, known as the spiral case.

Until 11 June 2014, sterilization was requisite for legal sex change in Denmark.

===Finland===
Finland required forced sterilization for adults to legally change their sex, until 3 April 2023 

===Germany===

One of the first acts by Adolf Hitler after the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Enabling Act of 1933 gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the German state was to pass the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring (&quot;Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses&quot;) in July 1933. The law was signed by Hitler himself, and over 200 eugenic courts were created specifically as a result of this law. Under it, all doctors in the Third Reich were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed intellectually disabled, characterized mentally ill (including schizophrenia and manic depression), epileptic, blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals with alcoholism or Huntington&#x27;s disease could also be sterilized. The individual&#x27;s case was then presented in front of a court of Nazi officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed upon the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race &quot;Rhineland Bastards&quot; were also sterilized beginning in 1937. The sterilization program went on until the war started, with about 600,000 people sterilized.

By the end of World War II, over 400,000 individuals were sterilized under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilization was brought-up at the Nuremberg trials after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from which they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired racial policies, including their T-4 euthanasia program, in which around 70,000 people who were institutionalized or had birth defects were killed.

=== Guatemala ===
Guatemala is one country that resisted family planning programs, largely due to lack of governmental support, including civil war strife, and strong opposition from both the Catholic Church and Evangelical Christians until 2000, and as such, has the lowest prevalence of contraceptive usage in Latin America. In the 1980s, the archbishop of the country accused USAID of mass sterilizations of women without consent, but a President Reagan backed commission found the allegations to be false.

=== Iceland ===
Since 2019, nonconsensual sterilization is forbidden in Iceland unless deemed medically necessary. However, this law only addresses the procedures of tubal ligation and surgical blocking of the fallopian tubes, excluding hysterectomies from the ban. Iceland&#x27;s laws surrounding legalization of sterilization practices also do not address consent of the disabled individuals undergoing these procedures. In March 2023, mother Hermina Hreidarsdottir authorized a hysterectomy for her severely cognitively impaired 20-year-old daughter due to her abnormal menstrual cycle. Ms. Hreidarsdottir took liberty of this decision for her daughter without consulting her because she believed that this sterilization procedure would improve her daughter&#x27;s quality of life. 

=== India ===
The Emergency in India from 1975 and 1977 resulted from internal and external conflict for the country, and resulted in misuse of power and human rights violations from the government. On 6 August 1976, the state of Maharashtra became the first governmental unit to enact legislation mandating compulsory sterilization of men and women after the birth of a third child, passing the Family (Restrictions on Size) Bill on its third reading and sending it to the President of India for the required assent. The President reacted favorably and sent the bill back to the Maharashtra government with suggested amendments that would be necessary for an enactment, but before the measure could be passed, new elections were called and the legislation was not passed.

Stopping short of forced sterilization, the national government enacted an incentive program for a family planning initiative that began in 1976 in an attempt to lower the exponentially increasing population. This program focused on male citizens and used propaganda and monetary incentives to impoverished citizens to get sterilized. People who agreed to get sterilized would receive land, housing, and money or loans. This program led millions of men to receive vasectomies, and an undetermined amount of these were coerced. There were reports of officials blocking off villages and dragging men to surgical centers for vasectomies. However, after much protest and opposition, the country switched to targeting women through coercion, withholding welfare or ration card benefits, and bribing women with food and money. This switch was theorized to be based on the principle women are less likely to protest for their own rights. Many deaths occurred as a result of both the male and the female sterilization programs. These deaths were likely attributed to poor sanitation standards and quality standards in the Indian sterilization camps.

Sanjay Gandhi, son of the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was largely responsible for what turned out to be a failed program. A strong mistrust against family planning initiatives followed the highly controversial program, the effect of which continues into the 21st century. Sterilization policies are still enforced in India, targeting mostly indigenous and lower-class women who are herded into the sterilization camps. The most recent abuse of family planning systems was highlighted by the death of 15 lower-class women in a sterilization center in Chhattisgarh in 2014. Despite these deaths, sterilization is still the highest used method of birth control with 39% of women in India turning to sterilization in 2015.

According to Human Rights Law Network:Forced sterilization has been an issue that has also affected the disabled population of women in India. In 2016, the Right to Persons with Disabilities Act (RPWD) was introduced to legally address the problems faced by the disabled community and ensure equitable access to justice for all members of society:&quot;While the RPWD Act took a step towards recognizing the issue of forced abortions under Section 92(f)[1] which states that any medical procedure performed on a disabled woman without her express consent that leads to the termination of pregnancy is punishable with an imprisonment term, there is still no specific mention of forced sterilization as a problem.&quot;There is no clause in the RPWD that addresses the notion of &quot;expressed consent.&quot; Consent in relation to family planning and sterilization practices has been a point of contention in India&#x27;s history of reproductive justice of disabled individuals.

=== Israel ===
In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO Haifa Women&#x27;s Coalition published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by Israeli Educational Television a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months.

=== Japan ===
In the first part of the reign of Emperor Hirohito, Japanese governments promoted increasing the number of healthy Japanese, while simultaneously decreasing the number of people who were afflicted with mental retardation, disability, genetic disease, and other conditions that led to inferiority in the Japanese genepool.

The &quot;Leprosy Prevention laws&quot; of 1907, 1931, and 1953 permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common, and authorized punishment of patients &quot;disturbing peace&quot;. Under the colonial Korean &quot;Leprosy prevention ordinance&quot;, Korean patients were also subjected to hard labor.

The &quot;National Eugenic Law&quot; was promulgated in 1940 by the Konoe government, after rejection of the original &quot;Race Eugenic Protection Law&quot; in 1938. From 1940 to 1945, sterilization was done to 454 Japanese persons under this law. Appx. 25,000 people, including 8,500 under (forced or spontaneous) consent, were surgically processed until 1995.

According to the &quot;Eugenic Protection Law&quot; (1948), sterilization could be enforced upon criminals &quot;with genetic predisposition to commit crime&quot;, patients with genetic diseases including mild ones such as total color-blindness, hemophilia, albinism, ichthyosis, and mental affections such as schizophrenia, manic-depression possibly deemed occurrent in their opposition and epilepsy. The mental sicknesses were added in 1952.

In early 2019, Japan&#x27;s supreme court upheld a requirement that transgender people must have their reproductive organs removed.

In March 2019, Japan&#x27;s legal policy about transgender people was:The last stipulation of the GID Act concerning forced sterilization was recently overturned in October 2023. Japan’s supreme court ruled that requiring transgender people to undergo sterilization so that they can legally change their gender identity is unconstitutional. The court stated that forcing the sterilization of the plaintiff, a transgender woman, as a requirement to change her gender on her Japanese family registry certificate was a restriction on &quot;her freedom not to harm herself against her will&quot;. The court did not address the other requirement under the GID Act, which outlines that transgender people must undergo transition surgery in order to legally register as the gender with which they identify.

In July 2024, the Supreme Court of Japan ruled that the Eugenic Protection Law passed in 1948 was unconstitutional, and eliminated the 20-year statute of limitations for those affected by the law.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, HIV was considered an ongoing issue, and the governor believed that compulsory sterilization of women infected with HIV could stop the spread of the virus. In 2012, a report titled &quot;Robbed of Choice&quot; sparked outrage. The report outlined the experiences of 40 women infected with HIV that had been sterilized against their will. 5 of the 40 women filed a lawsuit against the government of Kenya, claiming violations of their Health and Human Rights. The majority of the women who were sterilized knew nothing about the procedure or its consequences, which was one reason they did not push the issue. The President thought it would be good to keep a list of women who had been infected with HIV, but by naming these women, many of them did not to want to receive medical treatment due to the shame associated with the virus. &quot;The authors concluded that punitive and restrictive laws related to pregnancy have numerous adverse consequences—both health-related and socioeconomic—for women, and urged human rights groups to work with government institutions to protect and fulfill women&#x27;s fundamental reproductive rights.&quot;

=== Nigeria ===
Laws in Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania involve references to medical operations where the intended benefit for the patient is not tied to any legal consequences for medical professionals involved. Specifically, the criminal Code of Nigeria States that: “Performing with good faith and with reasonable care and skill a surgical operation upon any person for his benefit, if the performance of the operation is reasonable, having regard to the patient’s state and to all the circumstances of the case.”

In Nigeria, young girls with intellectual disabilities are susceptible to non consensual sterilization. No current laws explicitly prevent involuntary sterilization. And the laws that currently surround and may apply to the issue are not helpful in preventing it. The African Commission on Human and People’s Rights declared that involuntary sterilization violates the right to “equality and non-discrimination, dignity, liberty and security of the person.”

Involuntary sterilization in Nigeria is more common for girls with intellectual disabilities than for boys with intellectual disabilities and more common for those with intellectual disabilities specifically in comparison to other disabilities. Involuntary sterilization commonly occurs when relatives initiate it. In several studies involving parents of girls with disabilities who had initiated involuntary sterilization, respondents said that the primary reason for sterilization was to prevent pregnancy either for financial reasons or due to risk of offspring with intellectual disabilities. However, similar motivations for sterilization were not common for girls without intellectual disabilities. There is also a gendered element sterilization as the Nigeria law code penalizes emasculation, which makes it so that men cannot reproduce. There is no such penalization for sterilization of women.

===Mexico===
Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.&quot;

A report made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.

This happens even when the health norm NOM 005-SSA2-1993 states that family planning is &quot;the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services&quot; and that &quot;the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons&quot;.

===Peru===
In Peru, President Alberto Fujimori (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of the &quot;Programa Nacional de Población&quot;, a sterilization program put in place by his administration. During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous people (mainly the Quechuas and the Aymaras), in the name of a &quot;public health plan&quot;, presented on 28 July 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from USAID (36 million dollars), the Nippon Foundation, and later, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). On 9 September 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the &quot;General Law of Population&quot;, in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church, as well as the Catholic organization Opus Dei. In February 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.

On 25 February 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government&#x27;s House Committee on International Relations, to address controversy surrounding Peru&#x27;s program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour &quot;waiting period&quot; for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.

In September 2001, Minister of Health Luis Solari launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the &quot;irregularities&quot; of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies. The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the Shining Path guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and Alejandro Aguinaga (1999–2000). A study by sociologist , &quot;Nada Personal&quot; (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, &quot;tubal ligation festivals&quot; were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the &quot;pueblos jóvenes&quot; (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.

On 21 October 2011, Peru&#x27;s Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ruled that President Fujimori&#x27;s sterilization program involved crimes against humanity, which are not time-limited. It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America. It may carry a parallel to any suspect cases for international investigation in any other continent, and be in the sphere of medical genocide. As of 12 December 2021: 

=== Russia ===
Since children cannot legally live in psychoneurologic internats in Russia, and there are no institutions where internats&#x27; patients can live with their children, almost all pregnant women are aborted in PNIs. During abortions, PNI patients are also often subjected to forced sterilization - their fallopian tubes are tied, motivated by allegedly detected &quot;serious complications&quot;.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, there have been multiple reports of HIV-positive women sterilized without their informed consent and sometimes without their knowledge. The Commission for Gender Equality investigated 48 sterilizations that were performed in fifteen state hospitals without patient consent from 2002 to 2005. This investigation into these hospitals revealed that medical providers threatened to not assist women during birth if they did not sign consent forms to being sterilized. In most cases these forms were not explained to patients by medical personnel. However, the inquiry was hampered by hostile hospital staff and the sudden &quot;disappearance&quot; of patient files. An interview with one of these patients revealed that she did not learn that she had been sterilized during her C-section until a physician told her eleven years after that she had no uterus. She went to the hospital were the surgery was performed and was told by a physician that it was done to save her life and consent was received from her mother. The patient did not have HIV or any other life-threatening condition, and her mother had not consented to the removal of her uterus. The report from the Commission for Gender Equality noted that some of the patients interviewed were given consent forms that they did not understand and were coerced to sign. The bulk of these operations were performed to prevent women who are HIV-positive from having more children. The HIV epidemic in South Africa has a prevalence of 13% and has largely affected the family structures in the country. Medical staff of these hospitals have justified their actions as an effort to stop the growing HIV numbers in the country that exhaust the healthcare systems. The Commission urged Health Minister Zweli Mkhize to take action against these state hospitals and to provide some form of redress to the many affected women.

===Sweden===

The eugenics program in Sweden was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976. According to the 2000 governmental report, 21,000 were estimated to have been forcibly sterilized, 6,000 were coerced into a &#x27;voluntary&#x27; sterilization while the nature of a further 4,000 cases could not be determined. Of those sterilized 93% were women. The reasons given for these sterilizations included mental slowness, racial differences, antisocial behavior, promiscuous behavior, and other behaviors deemed inappropriate. At the time, the government saw itself as a forward-thinking and enlightened welfare state. The Swedish state subsequently formed a commission of inquiry to determine victims that could claim compensation for trauma at the hands of the state. The sterilization program ended in the government paying over $22,000 in compensation to victims.

Until December 2012, Swedish law forced transgender individuals to be sterilized before having their legal documents updated. After the law was repealed, those who were forcibly sterilized under the law began to demand compensation. In 2017, the government announced that it will pay these compensations.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1911, while he was serving as Home Secretary, Winston Churchill favored the sterilization of feeble-minded persons. Reginald McKenna, who succeeded Churchill as Home Secretary, introduced the Feeble-Minded Control Bill, a bill that would enact forcible sterilization of such individuals; the bill gained the support of the Anglican archbishops of Canterbury and York, that included forced sterilization. Despite support for the bill by the Anglican primates, English writer G. K. Chesterton and the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom led a successful effort to defeat that clause&#x27;s inclusion in what would eventually become the 1913 Mental Deficiency Act, though the final act did create a scheme for state-enforced confinement of mentally disabled persons in specialized institutions. In 1934, the Brock Report recommended sterilisation of people who were mentally and physically disabled, but its proposals did not gain enough support to be made law.

In one specific case in 2015, the Court of Protection of the United Kingdom ruled that a woman with six children and an IQ of 70 should be sterilized for her own safety because another pregnancy would have been a &quot;significantly life-threatening event&quot; for her and the fetus and was not related to eugenics.

=== United States ===

During the Progressive Era ( to 1920), the United States was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics. Thomas C. Leonard, professor at Princeton University, describes American eugenics and sterilization as ultimately rooted in economic arguments and further as a central element of Progressivism alongside minimum wage laws, restricted immigration, and the introduction of pension programs. The heads of the programs were avid proponents of eugenics and frequently argued for their programs which achieved some success nationwide mainly in the first half of the 20th century.

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that &quot;mental defectives&quot; should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity. The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were intellectually disabled people and the mentally ill, but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with epilepsy, and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different from today&#x27;s. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being &quot;feeble-minded&quot; because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

A relative minority of sterilizations targeting crime took place in prisons and other penal institutions. In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States.

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was Michigan, in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass. Eight years later Pennsylvania&#x27;s state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. Indiana became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in 1907, followed closely by California and Washington in 1909. Several other states followed, but such legislation remained controversial enough to be defeated in some cases, as in Wyoming in 1934. In the 1920s, Eugenicists were particularly interested in black women in the South and Latina women in the Southwest in order to break the chain of welfare dependency and curb the population rise of non-white citizens.

After World War II, public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany, though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1976, Indian Health Services sterilized between 25 and 42 percent of women of reproductive age who came in seeking healthcare services. In California, ten women who delivered their children at LAC-USC hospital between 1971-1974 and were sterilized without proper consent sued the hospital in the landmark &quot;Madrigal v. Quilligan&quot; case in 1975. The plaintiffs lost the case, but numerous changes to the consent process were made following the ruling, such as offering consent forms in the patient&#x27;s native language, and a 72-hour waiting period between giving consent and undergoing the procedure.The Oregon Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983, with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981. The U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists E. S. Gosney and Paul Popenoe, which was said by the government of Adolf Hitler to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, &quot;Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital&quot; (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The 27 states where sterilization laws remained on the books (though not all were still in use) in 1956 were: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Some states still have forced sterilization laws in effect, such as Washington state.

As of January 2011, discussions were under way regarding compensation for the victims of forced sterilization under the authorization of the Eugenics Board of North Carolina. Governor Bev Perdue formed the NC Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation in 2010 in order &quot;to provide justice and compensate victims who were forcibly sterilized by the State of North Carolina&quot;. In 2013 North Carolina announced that it would spend $10 million beginning in June 2015 to compensate men and women who were sterilized in the state&#x27;s eugenics program; North Carolina sterilized 7,600 people from 1929 to 1974 who were deemed socially or mentally unfit.

The inability to pay for the cost of raising children has been a reason courts have ordered coercive or compulsory sterilization. In June 2014, a Virginia judge ruled that a man on probation for child endangerment must be able to pay for his seven children before having more children; the man agreed to get a vasectomy as part of his plea deal. In 2013, an Ohio judge ordered a man owing nearly $100,000 in unpaid child support to &quot;make all reasonable efforts to avoid impregnating a woman&quot; as a condition of his probation. Kevin Maillard wrote that conditioning the right to reproduction on meeting child support obligations amounts to &quot;constructive sterilization&quot; for men unlikely to make the payments. 

As of 19 July 2021 it was reported that:

==== Georgia immigration detention center 2020 ====
In 2020, four non-profit organizations (which are listed below) joined Dawn Wooten to accuse a privately-owned U.S. immigration detention center in the U.S. state of Georgia of forcibly sterilizing women. The reports claimed that a doctor conducted unauthorized medical procedures upon women who were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Dawn Wooten was a nurse and former employee. She claims that a high rate of sterilizations were performed upon spanish-speaking women and women who spoke various indigenous languages that are common in Latin America. Wooten said that the center did not obtain proper consent for these surgeries, or lied to women about the medical procedures. More than 40 women submitted testimony in writing to document these abuses.

In September 2020, Mexico demanded more information from U.S. authorities about medical procedures that were performed upon illegal immigrants in detention centers, after allegations that six Mexican women were sterilized without their consent. The ministry said that consulate personnel had interviewed 18 Mexican women who were detained at the center, none of which &quot;claimed to have undergone a hysterectomy&quot;. Another woman said that she had undergone a gynecological operation, although there was nothing in her detention file to support that she agreed to the procedure.

==== Effect on disabled persons ====
As stated previously, eugenics in the United States spread to target mentally disabled persons. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low, with the sole exception of California, until the 1927 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, which upheld under the U.S. Constitution the forced sterilization of patients at a Virginia home for intellectually disabled people. In the wake of that decision, over 62,000 people in the United States, most of them women, were sterilized. The number of sterilizations performed per year increased until another Supreme Court case, &quot;Skinner v. Oklahoma&quot;, 1942, complicated the legal situation by ruling against sterilization of criminals if the equal protection clause of the constitution was violated. That is, if sterilization was to be performed, then it could not exempt white-collar criminals. This case, however, does not directly overturn the decision made in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;. Instead, it invalidates the central argument of the decision, and has been used in several cases to deny guardians the right to sterilize the disabled person under their care.

The Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization. The opinion of ACOG is that &quot;the physician must consult with the patient&#x27;s family, agents, and other caregivers&quot; if sterilization is desired for a mentally limited patient. In 2003, Douglas Diekema wrote in Volume 9 of the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews that &quot;involuntary sterilization ought not be performed on mentally retarded persons who retain the capacity for reproductive decision-making, the ability to raise a child, or the capacity to provide valid consent to marriage.&quot; The &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; claimed, in a 1999 article, that doctors are regularly confronted with requests to sterilize mentally limited people who cannot give consent for themselves. The article recommend that sterilization should only occur when there is a &quot;situation of necessity&quot; and the &quot;benefits of sterilization outweigh the drawbacks.&quot;

The &quot;American Journal of Bioethics&quot; published an article, in 2010, that concluded the interventions used in the Ashley treatment may benefit future patients. These interventions, at the request of the parents and guidance from the physicians, included a hysterectomy and surgical removal of the breast buds of the mentally and physically disabled child. Proponents of the treatments argue that it protects disabled persons from sexual assault, unwanted pregnancy, and difficulties of menstruation. The interventions are still legal in many states, despite the argument that it violates a person&#x27;s constitutional right to avoid unwanted intrusions. Discussion on the involuntary sterilization of disabled persons is now largely focused on the right of a guardian to request sterilization.

==== Criminal justice system ====

In addition to eugenics purposes, sterilization was used as a punitive measure against sex offenders, people identified as homosexual, or people deemed to masturbate too much. California, the first state in the U.S. to enact compulsory sterilization based on eugenics, sterilized all prison inmates under the 1909 sterilization law. In the last 40 years, judges have offered lighter punishment (i.e. probation instead of jail sentences) to people willing to use contraception or be sterilized, particularly in child abuse/endangerment cases. One of the most famous cases of this was &quot;People v. Darlene Johnson&quot;, during which Johnson, a woman charged with child abuse sentenced to seven years in prison, was offered probation and a reduced prison sentence if she agreed to use Norplant.

In addition to child abuse cases, some politicians proposed bills mandating Norplant use among women on public assistance as a requirement to maintain welfare benefits. As noted above, some judges offered probation in lieu of prison time to women who agreed to use Norplant, while other court cases have ordered parents to cease childbearing until regaining custody of their children after abuse cases. Some legal scholars and ethicists argue such practices are inherently coercive. Furthermore, such scholars link these practices to eugenic policies of the 19th and early 20th century, highlighting how such practices not only targeted poor people, but disproportionately impacted minority women and families in the U.S., particularly black women.

In the late 1970s, to acknowledge the history of forced and coercive sterilizations and prevent ongoing eugenics/population control efforts, the federal government implemented a standardized informed consent process and specific eligibility criteria for government funded sterilization procedures. Some scholars argue the extensive consent process and 30-day waiting period go beyond preventing instances of coercion and serve as a barrier to desired sterilization for women relying on public insurance.

Though formal eugenics laws are no longer routinely implemented and have been removed from government documents, instances of reproductive coercion still take place in U.S. institutions today. In 2011, investigative news released a report revealing that between 2006 and 2011, 148 female prisoners in two California state prisons were sterilized without adequate informed consent. In September 2014, California enacted Bill SB 1135 that bans sterilization in correctional facilities, unless the procedure shall be required in a medical emergency to preserve an inmate&#x27;s life.

====Puerto Rico====
Puerto Rican physician Lanauze Rolón founded the League for Birth Control in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1925, but the League was quickly squashed by opposition from the Catholic church. A similar League was founded seven years later, in 1932, in San Juan and continued in operation for two years before opposition and lack of support forced its closure. Yet another effort at establishing birth control clinics was made in 1934 by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in a relief response to the conditions of the Great Depression. As a part of this effort, 68 birth control clinics were opened on the island. The next mass opening of clinics occurred in January 1937 when American Clarence Gamble, in association with a group of wealthy and influential Puerto Ricans, organized the Maternal and Infant Health Association and opened 22 birth control clinics.

The Governor of Puerto Rico, Blanton Winship, enacted Law 116, which went into effect on 13 May 1937. It was a birth control and eugenic sterilization law that allowed the dissemination of information regarding birth control methods and legalized the practice of birth control. The government cited a growing population of the poor and unemployed as motivators for the law. Changers were made to the Penal Code in 1937 which made abortion effectively legal. It was allowed for health reasons, without specifying details in the law. This gave doctors discretion to interpret what constituted a health reason, effectively legalizing abortion. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties. The law was repealed on 8 June 1960.

=====1940s–1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, both threatening U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment. In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as &quot;Operation Bootstrap.&quot; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in emigration from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955. The issues of immigration, Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico. Princeton&#x27;s Office of Population Research, in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control. Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans. In response, Puerto Rico&#x27;s governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans. Joseph Sunnen, a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the Sunnen Foundation in 1957. The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title &quot;La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia&quot; and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.

=====Sterilization procedures and coercion=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the &quot;hyper-fertility&quot; of Puerto Ricans. Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing &quot;population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,&quot; was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico. A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico. Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure. Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception. Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized. This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization. There is additional evidence that true informed consent was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth. As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen&#x27;s privately funded clinics. At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation. The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees. The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.

======Controversy and opposing opinions======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women in regard to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass-sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass and Iris Lopez, have argued that the history and popularity of mass-sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for population control. They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass-sterilization campaign.

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass-sterilization program. She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization, and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.

A system was proposed by the California state senator Nancy Skinner to compensate victims of the well-documented examples of prison sterilizations that resulted from California&#x27;s eugenics programs, but this did not pass by the bill&#x27;s 2018 deadline in the legislature.

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people. By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand. In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.

In 1969, sociologist Harriet Presser analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico. She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women. She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.

Presser&#x27;s analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39. Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10-to-14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20-to-24 years. Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births. Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser&#x27;s assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized. As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world. In 1993, ethnographic work done in New York by anthropologist Iris Lopez showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations. The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.

===Uzbekistan===
According to reports, , forced and coerced sterilization is the current governmental policy in Uzbekistan for women with two or three children, as a means of forcing population control and to improve maternal mortality rates. In November 2007, a report by the United Nations Committee Against Torture reported that &quot;the large number of cases of forced sterilization and removal of reproductive organs of women at reproductive age after their first or second pregnancy indicate that the Uzbek government is trying to control the birth rate in the country&quot; and noted that such actions were not against the national Criminal Code. In response to that, the Uzbek delegation to the associated conference was &quot;puzzled by the suggestion of forced sterilization, and could not see how this could be enforced&quot;.

Reports of forced sterilizations, hysterectomies, and IUD-insertions first emerged in 2005, although it is reported that the practice originated in the late 1990s, with reports of a secret decree dating from 2000. The current policy was allegedly instituted by Islam Karimov under Presidential Decree PP-1096, which is titled: &quot;on additional measures to protect the health of the mother and child, the formation of a healthy generation&quot;, and which came into force in 2009. In 2005, Deputy Health Minister Assomidin Ismoilov confirmed that doctors in Uzbekistan were being held responsible for increased birth rates.

Based upon a report by the journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors that they must perform surgical sterilizations upon women. One doctor reported: &quot;It&#x27;s ruling number 1098, and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.&quot;, in a loss of the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.

On 15 May 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow, the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: &quot;we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2–1.3&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of RFE/RL reported that, with this statement, Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan. The main Uzbek television channel, called O&#x27;zbekiston, cut-out Karimov&#x27;s statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the government of Uzbekistan continues to pursue such programs.

===Other countries===
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most of the Northern European countries, as well as in other more-or-less Protestant countries. Other countries that had notably active sterilization programs include Denmark (&quot;that country&#x27;s forced sterilization of 60,000 people in 1935-76&quot;), Norway, Finland(&quot;In Finland, to change one&#x27;s gender markers in the juridical system (also known as gender recognition), trans people are, still, &quot;forcibly sterilised.&quot; In the laws regarding gender recognition, this requirement is called the &#x27;inability to reproduce&#x27;, a choice of words that makes it sound a lot less threatening than &#x27;forced sterilisation&#x27;&quot;), Estonia, Switzerland, Iceland, and some countries in Latin America (including Panama).

<text>Greenfield is a neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh, in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States. It is part of the city&#x27;s 15th Ward along with Hazelwood and Glen Hazel. Greenfield is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill to the north and east (including Schenley Park, which shares a long border with Greenfield), Hazelwood to the south and west, and Oakland to the northwest. Greenfield includes the geographically and culturally distinct sub-neighborhood of Four Mile Run, also known as Rusyn Valley. Pittsburgh Fire Station #12 is located in the neighborhood on Winterburn Avenue.

==History==
In 1768, a large tract of woodland was purchased for $10,000 under the Treaty of Fort Stanwix made with the Native Americans. This area included what became Greenfield and neighboring Hazelwood, which today are both part of the city&#x27;s 15th ward. By the late 1800s, many of Greenfield&#x27;s residents were of Irish, Polish, Slovak, Italian, Hungarian, and Carpatho-Rusyn descent. They resided in Greenfield and traveled to Hazelwood, Homestead and Duquesne to work in the steel mills.

During the Civil War, Greenfield (part of Squirrel Hill at the time) was the site of a small redoubt, Fort Black on Bigelow Street between Parade and Shields Streets, also known as Fort Chess or Fort Squirrel Hill.

==City steps==
A neighborhood with uneven and hilly topography, Greenfield has 26 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Greenfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation, business districts, and playgrounds and provide an easy way to travel through this hilly, densely populated area.

==Points of interest==
Greenfield contains two small business districts along Greenfield Avenue and Murray Avenue. A major travel route is along Beechwood Boulevard, connecting I-376 to the Waterfront shopping district in Homestead. As a predominantly residential neighborhood, Greenfield boasts three baseball fields, four basketball courts, two hockey rinks, two soccer fields, and a swimming pool. It is also home to seven churches and one synagogue; the largest is St. Rosalia, a Roman Catholic church. Greenfield is known among locals for very steep hills, a chaotic street grid off the main roads, and a preponderance of single lane 2-way streets, which does not usually lead to congestion as the neighborhood is not heavily traveled (excluding Murray and Greenfield Avenues and Beechwood Boulevard, which are all multi-lane streets).

Similar to other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, Greenfield hosts a holiday parade and fireworks every December. The fireworks, which are usually sponsored by Zambelli Fireworks, are shot off from Magee Field.

Spanning I-376 and connecting Greenfield to Oakland is the Beechwood Boulevard Bridge, known more popularly as the Greenfield Bridge. It was built in the 1920s and eventually demolished on December 28, 2015. It was replaced by a new bridge that became available for public use in October, 2017.

<doc id="720905" wikidata="Q3363301" url="?curid=720905" title="Paradiso (novel)">
<text>Paradiso is a novel by Cuban writer José Lezama Lima, the only one completed and published during his lifetime. Written in an elaborately baroque style, the narrative follows the childhood and youth of José Cemí, and depicts many scenes which resonate with Lezama&#x27;s own life as a young poet in Havana. Many of the characters reappear in Lezama&#x27;s posthumous novel &quot;Oppiano Licario&quot;, which was published in Mexico in 1977.

==Background==
The novel was originally published in Cuba in an edition regarded by the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar as being highly unsatisfactory, in part because of Lezama&#x27;s poor punctuation and stylistic errors. With Lezama&#x27;s blessing, Cortázar personally edited the text for a subsequent Mexican edition, correcting &quot;thousands of errors and ambiguities.&quot;

Despite having written one of the most accomplished novels in Cuba&#x27;s history, Lezama said he never considered himself a novelist, but rather a poet who wrote a poem that became a novel. &quot;Paradiso&quot; can thus be considered a kind of long poem, just as well as a neo-baroque novel.

==Plot==
The novel relates Cemí&#x27;s struggles with a mysterious childhood illness, describes the death of his father, and explores his homosexuality and literary sensibilities. He lives in the world of pre-Castro Havana, and the Cuban Revolution only appears as a secondary plot. Some of the later chapters incorporate narrative experiments in which several alternating stories, set during widely divergent eras and having no immediately apparent connection with José Cemí, are interwoven and eventually merged. (In a letter to Julio Cortázar, Lezama explained that these chapters represent Cemí&#x27;s dreams after the death of his father.) 

== Controversy ==
Because of the graphic homosexual scenes and the novel&#x27;s ambivalence towards the political situation of the day, &quot;Paradiso&quot; encountered controversy and publication problems. Today it is widely read in the Spanish-speaking world but has not achieved the same fame in English-speaking countries despite a translation by the American translator Gregory Rabassa.

<doc id="720914" wikidata="Q5688162" url="?curid=720914" title="Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)">
<text>Hazelwood is a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is represented on Pittsburgh City Council by Barb Warwick. It is bordered by Greenfield and Oakland on the north, Squirrel Hill and Glen Hazel on the east, and the Monongahela River on the south and west. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire houses 13 Engine and 13 Truck in Hazelwood.

==Early history==
In 1758 a large tract of woodland was purchased for $10,000 under the Stanwix Treaty made with the Native-Americans. This area would include Hazelwood and Greenfield of the 15th ward.

Hazelwood takes its name from the hazelnut trees which once flourished along the Monongahela river. The first settlers were of Scottish descent and settled what was known as Scotch Bottom. This area ran from Four Mile Run (lower Greenfield) to Six Mile Ferry, four and six miles (10 km) from the Point (where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers merge) respectively. Among the first settlers was John Woods, a politician who built his &#x27;Hazel Hill&#x27; estate in 1784. That house still stands, the second oldest stone building in Pittsburgh after The Fort Pitt Blockhouse. Eventually, large farms were cut out of the wooded hills, attracting more residents and supplying the area with further wealth.

==Industrial age==

The first track of railroad was built by Mr. B. F. Jones, of the Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad and later of Jones and Laughlin. Unlike most lines, this railroad was built inland as to respect the residents concern of maintaining the river&#x27;s aesthetic value. This railroad would later separate Hazelwood into two sections, coining the local term &#x27;below the tracks&#x27;. In 1869 Hazelwood was incorporated into the city, and by the following year the railway had spurred iron and steel industries, railroading, boatbuilding and the river trade.

By the late 19th century Hazelwood was a bustling town. In the 1950s the neighborhood was host to over 200 businesses. It had become home to large Hungarian, Italian, Slovak, Carpatho-Rusin, Polish, and Irish populations. With the construction of the Civic Arena in the Hill District large African-American populations made Hazelwood a home.

In the 1980s the steel industry began to decline. As the industry packed up, so did business and many residents. Like many areas in the rust-belt, Hazelwood fell into disrepair. Hazelwood was home to the city of Pittsburgh&#x27;s last operating steel mill, the Hazelwood Coke Works, which was owned by Jones and Laughlin and later, its parent company, LTV, when it closed in 1998.

Recently, Hazelwood has been working to improve as a community. Many abandoned buildings have been razed, and new ones constructed in their place. In addition, some parks, such as Lewis Playground, in the neighborhood have been updated to provide recreation for the residents.

According to a December 23, 2008, article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, Dimperio&#x27;s Market, the only full service grocery store in Hazelwood, would close because of shoplifters.

==Neighborhood revitalization==
Mirroring Pittsburgh&#x27;s overall decline, Hazelwood suffered a significant population loss and disinvestment following the decline of the steel industry and the final shuttering of the LTV Coke Works in 1997. However, the purchase of the 178-acre vacant brownfield site in 2002 by Almono LP (at the time composed of four Pittsburgh foundations) marked the beginning of a new era for Hazelwood. Since then, the neighborhood and community have organized to reinvest and revitalize their main street - Second Avenue - with new local-serving retail, stabilize and improve housing stock and affordability, and ensure redevelopment of the vacant 178-acre site is a positive catalyst for the neighborhood. These reinvestment efforts are often aided by the same foundations that compose Almono LP and own Hazelwood Green: the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, The Heinz Endowments, and the Richard King Mellon Foundation.

On January 8, 2019, the amended SP-10 Zoning Ordinance was passed by City Council for the 178-acre site, Hazelwood Green. This Zoning Ordinance amendment accompanied the new Preliminary Land Development Plan (PLDP), which was approved on September 11, 2018 by Pittsburgh Planning Commission to replace the plan of record. The PLDP provides a core framework with flexible programming and development approaches to make the site adaptive to fast shifting externalities. The PLDP has been designed (and registered with USGBC) to meet LEED for Neighborhood Development Plan standards, with an expectation to reach Gold certification in 2019. The plan calls for approximately 8 million square feet of development that would be home to 5,000 residents and approximately 15,000 employees.

To date, much of the horizontal development of Hazelwood Green has been completed, including: preliminary remediation, mass grading, new streets and utilities, and stormwater management system. After decades of being closed to the public, the site&#x27;s new streets - extensions of Hazelwood Avenue and Blair Street - were publicly dedicated and opened to the public on April 1, 2019. This was followed by the first tenants moving into the new building at Mill 19 in the summer of 2019. In 2020, the site&#x27;s first public open space - the Plaza - was expected to be completed and opened to the public, along with additional buildings opening.

==City steps==
The Hazelwood neighborhood has 18 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Hazelwood, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and the Hazelwood Greenway. They also provide an easy way for residents to travel through this hilly area.

<doc id="720916" wikidata="Q3360225" url="?curid=720916" title="Young Left (Sweden)">
<text>Young Left ( ) is a socialist, Marxist, and feminist youth organisation. It is the official youth wing of the Swedish Left Party. The organisation calls themselves a &quot;revolutionary youth organisation with roots in the communist part of the labour movement, anchored in the women&#x27;s movement and influenced by the environmental- and peace movement.&quot;

==Ideology==
Young Left is a socialist, Marxist, and feminist political youth organisation committed to organising young people to work for social change that evolved out of the labour movement, with influences from environmentalism, the peace movement, and the feminist movement. Young Left works for social justice and a society characterised by equality, secularism, generous welfare provisions for all citizens, generous immigration policies, and respect for the environment. As its mother party, the Left Party, as well as the Social Democratic Party, Young Left is a strong supporter of the Swedish labour unions and the Swedish model, with conditions of work such as wages being regulated in branch-level collective agreements between the unions and the employers, rather than on individual basis. Ung Vänster has had various names and political alignments over the years, but is continuously characterised by the issues that have been at the centre of its history, such as antifascism, social justice, equality, and justice. During the past years, the main focus of the organisation has been the struggle against growing xenophobia in Sweden (as they mean been witnessed by the electoral success of the Sweden Democrats during the national elections of 2010) and criticism of the right government, and in particular on its privatisations of welfare services and priorities of tax reductions, rather than increased public spending on welfare and investments in infrastructure and renewable energy.

The Young Left, unlike the Left Party, are a revolutionary socialist organisation, which differentiates them from the more reformist Left Party in that they want to implement societal changes by revolution, and not reform.

==Organisation==
Young Left works together with and supports the Left Party and Vänsterns Studentförbund, but makes, on the basis of its own analyses, independent decisions regarding organisational and political issues.

==History==

Young Left was founded in 1903 as Socialdemokratiska Ungdomsförbundet (SDUF, Social Democratic Youth League). However, the youth league has clearly attached itself to the left-wing within the Social Democratic Party. At the outbreak of the First World War, the tensions within the party aggravated. In May 1917, the youth league together with the left-wing faction within the party took the initiative to form a new party, Sverges socialdemokratiska vänsterparti (Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden). SDUF became the youth wing of the new party. SSV joined the Communist International in 1919, and was renamed to Sveriges kommunistiska parti (Communist Party of Sweden). Following that, SDUF was renamed to Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomförbund (Young Communist League of Sweden), and became the Swedish section of the Communist Youth International.

In 1952, Democratic Youth was founded on the initiative of the party, in order to be a broader youth movement. Until 1958, SKU and DU existed as parallel organisations. In 1958, the two organisations merged and took the name DU.

In 1967, ultra-left elements took over the organisation, and broke away to form Marxist-leninistiska kampförbundet (Marxist–Leninist Struggle League). Reconstruction work started rapidly. In 1970, the organisation was re-baptised as Kommunistisk Ungdom (Communist Youth). By 1973, there was a national organisation in function, and, by 1975, an ordinary congress was held.

Young Left have published the youth magazine &quot;Röd Press&quot; since 1982, when Young Left lost the rights of its magazine &quot;Stormklockan&quot; to the Maoist MLK in a trial.

In Sweden, Young Left was one of the many forces behind the large 15 February 2003 anti-war protest.

Under the later years of the 2010s, different members of the Young Left have been excluded because of strong couplings to the Revolutionary Front and the AFA. The national executive board have been doing both official exclusions and cut-offs in these cases. This is because these groups are not deemed compatible with the democratic socialism and anti-racism fight that the Young Left are driving. The party board of the Left Party has also been strongly advising for hard consequences in these situations.

After having had a stable membership of between 1,500 – 2,800 for a number of years, the membership of the youth organisation had declined to 964 in 2016 according to the Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society.

<text>Lambda Phi Epsilon (, also known as LPhiE and LFE) is the largest Asian-American-Interest fraternity in North America. Lambda Phi Epsilon is affiliated with the National APIDA Panhellenic Association, and is a former member of the North American Interfraternity Conference.

==History==
Lambda Phi Epsilon was formed on February 25, 1981, at the University of California, Los Angeles. Noting that Asian fraternities and sororities at the University of California campuses were recognized only as service organizations due to their membership&#x27;s focus on specific Asian groups and exclusion of other ethnic groups, the founders aimed to create a fraternity that transcends the traditional boundaries of national origins, bridges the gaps between those communities, and is recognized by the Greek community at large. 

Lambda Phi Epsilon&#x27;s vision is to be the preeminent international Asian interest fraternal organization, and to provide leadership, philanthropy, and advocacy in the community. While the original charter focused on Asian Pacific Americans, people from all ethnic backgrounds were welcome to join. Craig Ishigo and Darryl Mu signed the charter as president and vice president.

Within a few years, the fraternity had chartered to the University of Texas, Austin (&quot;Zeta chapter&quot;), the State University of New York, Buffalo (&quot;Nu chapter&quot;), and the University of Michigan (&quot;Xi chapter&quot;). In 1990, the organization was recognized by the North American Interfraternity Conference, being the first Asian Interest fraternity to do so. State University of New York, Buffalo (&quot;Nu chapter&quot;) was Lambda Phi Epsilon&#x27;s first chapter to be chartered on the American East Coast. 

Starting as Delta Gamma Tau, on September 15, 1992, this fraternity merged with Lambda Phi Epsilon (effectively taking on Lambda Phi Epsilon&#x27;s letters) to unify organizations with identical purposes and to strengthen the Asian American voice in the campus community. On December 5, 2004, Lambda Phi Epsilon established a colony at the University of Toronto (&quot;Alpha Xi chapter&quot;), which was the first chapter of the fraternity established outside the United States.

== Symbols ==
Lambda Phi Epsilon&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; or &quot;Leaders Among Men&quot;. Its colors are royal blue and white.

== Activities ==
Lambda Phi Epsilon currently awards three merit-based scholarships to active brothers in good standing who have been chosen from a pool of applicants. The Rising Leaders Among Men Scholarship recognizes first-year members, The Academic Excellence Scholarship recognizes academic achievement, and The Lambda of the Year Scholarship recognizes students who epitomize the organization&#x27;s mission statement.

Lambda Phi Epsilon holds an annual convention during Memorial Day weekend at various locations across North America, co-hosted with the sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Throughout the weekend, members have the opportunity to learn about the state of the fraternity as addressed by the National Board, network with alumni in career-oriented workshops, and socialize with fellow actives from around the world. Convention ends with an annual banquet that recognizes incoming and outgoing fraternal leadership, announces chapter promotions and awards, and showcases brotherhood step performances and other perpetuating traditions of the fraternity.

== Philanthropy ==
The fraternity&#x27;s national philanthropy works to raise awareness for bone marrow drives. For patients with leukemia or any other blood disorder, the best chance of finding a matching donor lies within their own ethnic community. Asian donors comprise a small fraction (7% as of January 2013) of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). Because of this, every chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon hosts several bone marrow drives in conjunction with organizations like the Asian American Donor Program, Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, and the former Cammy Lee Leukemia Foundation to inform, educate, and recruit potential marrow donors for the NMDP. Lambda Phi Epsilon recognized bone marrow drives as the national philanthropy when Evan Chen, a member from Stanford University, was diagnosed with leukemia in 1995. The fraternity organized a campus-wide movement to find a bone marrow match for Chen. What resulted was the largest bone marrow typing drive in the history of the NMDP and AADP (Asian American Donor Program). In a matter of days, over 2,000 people were typed. A match was eventually found for Chen, but by that time, the cancer had taken its toll and he died 1996. Since then, the fraternity organizes annual bone marrow drives to help others find matching donors. Collectively, chapters of Lambda Phi Epsilon amass hundreds of new registrants every year in national campaigns like Save Janet Liang and Save Nina Louie.

==Chapters==
Lambda Phi Epsilon has a total of 68 active chapters in 6 geographic regions.

== Notable members ==
*Yul Kwon – Winner of &quot;&quot; and named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sexiest Men for 2006. Served as deputy chief of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau. Host of PBS show called &quot;America Revealed&quot;.

== Member and chapter misconduct ==

=== Hazing ===
Lambda Phi Epsilon has experienced the most hazing incidents among Asian-American fraternities, including three deaths. All deaths occurred in the last 13 years. As of 2019, eighteen chapters have been closed. Hazing activities include (but are not limited to) knuckle push-ups, consumption of large amounts of alcohol and miscellaneous condiments, tackle football, and calisthenics.

In 2005, two pledges at separate universities died in hazing incidents. In August of that year, UC Irvine student Kenny Luong died after being tackled in a football game that pitted a 10-member pledge group against approximately 40 active members and alumni. The game lasted for more than 3 hours and was played without the use of pads. Prior to the football game, the pledges were forced to complete vigorous calisthenics such as close-fisted push-ups on gravel; jumping in the air while standing, landing on their chests without using their hands to break their fall; and drinking two gallons of water in one sitting. The chapter was officially shut down by UC Irvine in 2007.

In December 2005, Jack Phoummarath, an 18-year-old at the University of Texas, died from alcohol poisoning in what was described by his family as a hazing incident. Three former leaders of the chapter pleaded no contest. A settlement was reached with the fraternity for $4.2 million. The fraternity organization did not have insurance, and was unable to pay the entire settlement. The fraternity later established the Jack Phoummarath Memorial Scholarship in his honor.

In 2008, &quot;The Daily Northwestern&quot;, the newspaper of Northwestern University, published an article revealing hazing violations as part of the chapter&#x27;s pledging process. Pledges were forced to drink jugs of liquid believed to be a mixture of ketchup and Tabasco sauce and perform calisthenics all night. After an official university hearing, Lambda Phi Epsilon received a four-year suspension from Northwestern.

In 2013, another fraternity member died at San Francisco State University. Eighteen-year-old Peter Tran died due to alcohol poisoning during a &quot;crossing&quot; event at the house. The university later expelled Lambda Phi Epsilon from the campus following a full review.

In 2018, Bwog, a Columbia University news blog, received a detailed report about the initiation process of the &quot;Alpha Rho chapter&quot; at Columbia University. Bwog reported that, &quot;In the last week of the pledging process, the Columbia pledges were taken to the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s chapter. There, they were made to compete with the Penn Lambda pledges in physical activities, including push-ups and high knees. The exertion was so extreme that our source recounts passing out and being doused with ice water to forcibly awaken him.&quot; On Friday December 21, 2018, the &quot;Sigma chapter&quot; at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was voted to be shut down by the Board of Directors due to &quot;significance evidence of hazing being practiced as part of the new member education process.&quot; The chapter has been suspended indefinitely.

In 2018, Cal Poly&#x27;s investigation took place in regards to systemic hazing of new pledges in recent years.&quot;The university received anonymous reports that members of the chapter had taken part in the hazing and began the investigation September 28.&quot; Ultimately, it was determined the fraternity was involved with multiple accounts of painful and unsafe hazing such as forcing pledges to perform knuckle push-ups and late-night submersion in the ocean. In addition, the chapter forced pledges to consume large amounts of alcohol and provided minors with access to alcohol. The accounts were supported by corroborating testimonies from both current and former members of the fraternity. &quot;All anonymous sources said they were left with broken skin and bloodied knuckles. Some said they were left with scars.&quot; On Thursday, October 18, 2018, the chapter was officially suspended for a minimum of two academic years or until all the past members have graduated.

In June 2019, Pennsylvania State&#x27;s Office of Student Conduct and Lambda Phi Epsilon International Fraternity, Inc., launched a joint investigation after receiving allegations of hazing during the new member education process. The recommendation for suspension came from the university. On June 17, the international organization revoked the fraternity&#x27;s charter. Suspension of the &quot;Tau chapter&quot; at Pennsylvania State University results in losses of all privileges as a recognized student organization.&quot; The chapter has been suspended through 2023.

Michigan State University&#x27;s chapter was sued by a former member for compensatory damages with regards to hazing that he alleged happened in fall of 2021. Connor Mui said that he was forced to consume &quot;dangerous amounts of marijuana,&quot; which led to his hospitalization. Several days later, Mui alleged that he was required to perform calisthenics all night without sleep, following which he was hospitalized again and diagnosed with exertional rhabdomyolysis. He reported these incidents to MSU in December 2021, and the administration determined that &quot;there was a preponderance of evidence to validate a violation of&quot; school rules regarding hazing. The fraternity had its registered student organization status was on probation as recently as spring 2023.

=== Chapter suspensions ===
In March 2016, the UC Santa Cruz chapter was suspended following the arrests of several members accused of running a drug smuggling ring. The alpha Kappa Delta Phi sorority was also suspended for the same reason.

On May 29, 2020, screenshots of the NYU chapter group chat surfaced showing members of the fraternity making statements saying &quot;black peoples were lazy&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s only logical that police brutality is more common with those communities&quot;. These comments were in response to the George Floyd protests. Both the university and the fraternity suspended the chapter pending investigation. The incident prompted a push from New York activists to address racism among New York&#x27;s Chinese community.

On November 1, 2022, the Purdue chapter was suspended after investigations following allegations of hazing, sexual assault and relationship violence, academic dishonesty and underground functions. The results of the investigation prompted the Purdue chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi to end official relations with the fraternity

<doc id="720928" wikidata="Q760426" url="?curid=720928" title="Auglaize River">
<text>The Auglaize River (Shawnee: Kathinakithiipi) is a tributary of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. It drains a primarily rural farming area in the watershed of Lake Erie. The name of the river was derived from the French term for it. The French called it &quot;rivière à la Grande Glaize&quot; (later spelled as &quot;glaise&quot;, meaning river of Great Clay), referring to the soil in the area.

==Description==
The Auglaize River rises in southeastern Allen County, approximately southeast of Lima and north of Indian Lake. It flows southwest to Wapakoneta, then generally north in a zigzag course, past Delphos, Fort Jennings and Oakwood. It joins the Maumee from the south at Defiance, approximately east of the mouth of the Tiffin River at .

It receives the Ottawa River from the southeast in western Putnam County, northwest of Lima. It also receives the Blanchard River in western Putnam County. It receives the Little Auglaize River from the south in eastern Paulding County. It receives Flatrock Creek from the west in northeastern Paulding County.

A portage from the headwaters of the Great Miami River to the south bend of the Auglaize made it part of an important link between the watershed of the Ohio (and the Mississippi) and Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence watershed, heavily settled in pre-Columbian times.

During the days of the Ohio Country in the 18th century, the area around the river was inhabited by the Ottawa. During the mid-1790s, the area near the mouth of the Auglaize surpassed Kekionga to the west as the center of Indian influence. Fort Defiance was constructed in 1794 near the confluence of the Auglaize and the Maumee by General Mad Anthony Wayne. Fort Amanda, constructed along the river southwest of Lima in 1812, was an important American outpost during the War of 1812.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Auglaize River has also had the following names:
* Au Glaize River
* Auglaise River
* Cowthenake sepe
* Glaize River 
* Grand Au Glaze River 
* Grand Glaise River 
* Grand Glaize River 
* Great au Glaise River

<text>Muhammad Said al-Attar () (26 November 1927 – 20 November 2005) was the acting Prime Minister of Yemen for five months in 1994. During his career, he held various ministerial positions in Yemen and represented his country at the United Nations. From 1974 to 1985, Muhammad Said Al-Attar was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia (currently ESCWA).

== Career ==
Muhammad Said Al-Attar was born in 1927 in Djibouti from a Yemeni father originally from Al-Hojariya, (in Taez governorate, Al-Shomayatayn district) and a Yemeni mother from Ash Shihr coastal town in Hadhramaut governorate (Southern Yemen).

He undertook his primary and secondary education between Djibouti and Aden, before moving to Paris where he obtained several degrees in French literature from the University of Paris and a doctorate (Ph.D) in economics and social science from the Faculté des Lettres at the Sorbonne. Between 1959 and 1962, he was a research fellow at the Institut d’Etudes du Developpement Economic et Social in Paris.

In 1962, Muhammad Said Al-Attar joined the Republican revolutionary movement in Northern Yemen and supported the “26 September revolution” against the Imamat .

In November 1962, he was appointed as the first Director General of the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a member of the Supreme Council for Economic Affairs. He subsequently acted as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Economy and member of the High Committee for Planning from 1965 to 1967, and played a crucial role during the “70 days siege of Sanaa” in 1967. Between 1968 and 1971, Al-Attar was the Permanent Representative of the Arab Republic of Yemen at the United Nations in New York; he was appointed to this position again in 1973. He held the rank of Ambassador when he represented Yemen at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund conferences in 1971, and at the 1972 General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.

In December 1973, Al-Attar was appointed Executive Secretary of the newly established United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia (currently ESCWA) with the rank of United Nations Under-Secretary General. He held this position until 1985 when he returned to the Arab Republic of Yemen.

Before and after Yemeni reunification, he served in the government as Acting Prime Minister (1994), Deputy Prime Minister (1985–1990, 1992–1994, 1995–1997), Minister of Development (1985–1990), President of the Central Planning Body (1985), Minister of Industry (1990–1992), President of the General Investment Authority (1992–1993) and Minister of Petrol and Mineral resources (1995–1997). Between 1997 and 2002, Al-Attar was the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Yemen to the United Nations in Geneva.

Muhammad Said Al-Attar died on 20 November 2005 in Beirut where he was receiving medical treatment.

In 2007, Faysal Al-Oubuthani wrote in Al-Hayat newspaper: “We must recognise for a moment what this Yemeni man has given his country and all the Arab countries. A cultured economist fluent in foreign languages who has worked tirelessly to elevate the name of his country in international and regional fora while striding to gain respect for all Arab countries. Those who knew him closely and worked under his supervision can testify to the praise and recognition he gained from international economists and officials of several international organizations.”

Al-Attar was a member of the International Sociological Association (Madrid), the International Institute for Economic Sciences (Geneva), the Third World Forum (Dakar) and the Arabic Center for Studies (Amman).

<text>José María Andrés Fernando Lezama Lima (December 19, 1910 – August 9, 1976) was a Cuban writer, poet and essayist. He is considered one of the most influential figures in Cuban and Latin American literature. His novel &quot;Paradiso&quot; is one of the most important works in Spanish and one of the best novels of the 20th Century according to the Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo.&quot;

Lezama is a prominent referent of American Neo-Baroque literature. He created a mature poetic system characterized by its lyricism. His work features a wide variety of metaphors, allusions and allegories which he developed in essays such as &quot;Analecta del reloj&quot; (1953), &quot;La expresión americana&quot; (1957), &quot;Tratados en La Habana&quot; (1958) o &quot;La cantidad hechizada&quot; (1970).

==Biography==

Born in the Columbia Military Encampment close to Havana in the city of Marianao where his father was a colonel, Lezama lived through some of the most turbulent times of Cuba&#x27;s history, fighting against the Machado dictatorship. His literary output includes the semi-autobiographical, baroque novel &quot;Paradiso&quot; (1966), the story of a young man and his struggles with his mysterious illness, the death of his father, and his developing sensuality and poetic sensibilities. Lezama Lima also edited several anthologies of Cuban poetry and the magazines &quot;Verbum&quot; and &quot;Orígenes&quot;, presiding as the patriarch of Cuban letters for most of his later years.

Lezama Lima spent little time outside of his home country, making a trip to Mexico in 1949 and Jamaica in 1950). Nevertheless, Lezama&#x27;s poetry, essays and two novels draw images and ideas from a vast array of world cultures and historical time periods. The Baroque style that he forged relied equally upon his Góngora-influenced syntax and his stunning constellations of unlikely images, which often drew from Ancient Chinese and Egyptian philosophical texts and mythological narratives. Lezama Lima&#x27;s first published work, the long poem &quot;Muerte de Narciso,&quot; brought him national acclaim at the age of twenty-seven and established his well-wrought style and classical subject matter.

In addition to his poems and novels, Lezama wrote many essays on figures of world literature such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Valéry, Góngora and Rimbaud as well as on Latin American baroque aesthetics. Most notably the essays published as &quot;La Expresión Americana&quot; lay out his vision of the European baroque, its relation to the classical, and the American baroque.

Lezama Lima died in 1976 at age 65 and was buried in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. He was influential for Cuban and Puerto Rican writers of his generation and the next, such as Virgilio Piñera, Reinaldo Arenas, Fernando Velázquez Medina, René Marqués, and Giannina Braschi, who depict his life and works in their writing.

<doc id="720942" wikidata="Q7860918" url="?curid=720942" title="Typeahead">
<text>Typeahead is a feature of computers and software (and some typewriters) that enables users to continue typing regardless of program or computer operation—the user may type in whatever speed is desired, and if the receiving software is busy at the time it will be called to handle this later. Often this means that keystrokes entered will not be displayed on the screen immediately. This programming technique for handling uses what is known as a keyboard buffer.

Typeahead has its roots in the age of typewriters. The IBM Selectric typewriter, first released in 1961, had a mechanical key lockout feature designed to smooth out typists&#x27; irregular keystrokes that, to many users, felt like typeahead.

Achieving true typeahead requires maintaining a so-called &quot;typeahead buffer&quot;—a FIFO queue, for instance—whose role it is to store a limited amount of keyboard input until it is called for. Installing such a buffer can be done at both the hardware and the software levels; most modern operating systems, such as Unix, implement this using software, calling kernel interrupts.

In some network operations, one might attempt to dispatch information over a network, regardless whether the receiving program manages to keep up, using the recipient&#x27;s typeahead functions. However, as this is far too reliant on the specifications of the computer with which one is communicating, it is not often used.

<doc id="720943" wikidata="Q434613" url="?curid=720943" title="Kisshomaru Ueshiba">
<text>was a prominent Japanese master of aikido. He was the son of Morihei Ueshiba, founder of aikido, and became the international leader of aikido after his father&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Ueshiba was born on June 27, 1921, in the city of Ayabe, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. He was the third son and fourth child of Morihei Ueshiba and Hatsu Ueshiba (née Itokawa). Ueshiba began training under his father around 1937.

==Aikido career==
In 1942, while he was still studying at Waseda University, Morihei Ueshiba (who was retiring to Iwama) appointed him the head of the Kobukan Dojo in Shinjuku, Tokyo. He saved the &quot;dojo&quot; from fire bombing several times during the World War II. Ueshiba graduated from Waseda University, Faculty of Economics and Political Science with a degree in economics in 1946. 

Speaking about the period just after World War II, Moriteru Ueshiba said, &quot;there was not yet much activity at the Hombu Dojo. For a time my father [Kisshomaru Ueshiba] was actually in Iwama instead ... starting around 1949, he worked for about seven years at a company called Osaka Shoji. He had no other choice. Even if you have a dojo, you can&#x27;t make a living if nobody is coming to train, which was largely the case after the war. So, he took a job as an ordinary company employee during the day and taught only in the mornings and evenings.&quot;

Beginning in 1948, Ueshiba oversaw the development of the Aikikai Honbu organization (and eventually the tearing down of the Kobukan Dojo in 1967 to construct the Aikikai headquarters). In 1952, Ueshiba became a founding member and appointed head of the Aikido Division of the Kokusai Budoin (International Martial Arts Federation) by Prince Kaya Tsunenori to help spread aikido worldwide. In 1969, Kisshomaru Ueshiba assumed the title of Doshu with the passing of the Founder.

==Later life==
After Morihei Ueshiba&#x27;s death in 1969, Kisshomaru Ueshiba took on the mantle of &quot;Doshu&quot; (hereditary head). In 1986, in recognition of his contributions to the public good through the development and growth of Aikido, Kisshomaru Ueshiba received the Medal of Honor with Blue Ribbon from the Japanese Government. In 1990, In recognition of his distinguished services and contributions to cultural exchange between France and Japan, Ueshiba received a gold medal Sports Merit award from the French government. This is the first time a Japanese citizen has received this medal. In 1995, Ueshiba received the Third Order of the Sacred Treasure Award from the Japanese government. By 1998, Ueshiba&#x27;s health had declined and this necessitated visits to hospital.

Ueshiba died around 5:30 on January 4, 1999, in a Tokyo hospital. The cause of death was respiratory failure. As his father was the first &quot;Doshu&quot;, he was the second &quot;Doshu&quot;, and after his death, his son Moriteru Ueshiba became the third &quot;Doshu&quot;, following the &quot;iemoto&quot; system.

<text>U&amp;Eden is a British free-to-air channel broadcasting nature, factual entertainment and drama programming in the United Kingdom and Ireland as part of the UKTV network of channels. The channel originally launched on 8 March 2004 and relaunched in its current format on 27 January 2009. U&amp;Eden was a pay television channel until 2024.

On 29 November 2023, UKTV announced its intention to launch &#x27;U&#x27; – a new masterbrand that will unite its family channels and its streaming. Eden rebranded to U&amp;Eden on 16 October 2024.

Launched on 16 July 2024, UKTV&#x27;s streaming service UKTV Play became U; and its family of free-to-air channel adopted the &#x27;U&amp;...&#x27; branding: U&amp;Dave, U&amp;Drama, U&amp;W, and U&amp;Yesterday.

On 16 August 2024, Ofcom gave UKTV a new broadcasting licence for U&amp;Eden to become a free-to-air channel. U&amp;Eden launched on Freeview on 16 October, replacing U&amp;Yesterday+1.

Gold and Alibi rebranded to U&amp;Gold and U&amp;Alibi on 7 November 2024.

==History==

The UKTV channels were all rebranded on 8 March 2004. At the same time, Eden was launched as UKTV Documentary, showing factual documentaries, mainly from the BBC archives, on a variety of subjects if not covered by another channel in the UKTV network, such as Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;. Much of this programming had come from the former UKTV channel UK Horizons, which had closed down the day before and which the channel, and spun off a sister channel called UKTV People. UKTV Documentary occupied the same broadcasting slot as UK Horizons.

On 9 October 2008, UKTV announced plans to rebrand UKTV Documentary and UKTV People in early 2009. The news came just two days after UKTV&#x27;s entertainment channels were rebranded to Watch, Gold and Alibi. They announced that UKTV Documentary would be rebranded as Eden and this rebrand took place on 26 January 2009. As part of the rebrand, the channels programming output changed from all documentaries to primarily documentaries focusing on the natural environment. All other documentaries were transferred to UKTV History or UKTV People, depending on their subject matter.

In August 2024, it was reported that Eden had secured a licence to broadcast on Freeview, following the secure of a DTPS (Digital Television Programme Services) licence by Ofcom.

Eden was rebranded as U&amp;Eden and launched on Freeview, Freesat and Freely on 16 October 2024. The channel effectively became free-to-air on 7 October 2024, when its encryption was dropped on satellite in preparation for its addition to Freesat.

==Subsidiary channels==
===U&amp;Eden +1===
From launch, the channel has had a timeshift service, called Eden +1 and UKTV Documentary +1 before it. The service ran on Sky and Virgin Media and broadcast the channels schedule one hour later than usual. The timeshift was removed from Virgin Media in October 2008 to allow bandwidth for new channel Watch, however the timeshift service was restored on 7 October 2011.

===U&amp;Eden HD===
Eden HD launched on 4 October 2010 on Sky channel 559, running a high-definition simulcast of the main channel. As part of Virgin Media&#x27;s deal to sell its share of UKTV, all five of UKTV&#x27;s HD channels were added to Virgin&#x27;s cable television service by 2012. Eden HD was added to Virgin Media on 7 October 2011. On 3 October 2016, Eden HD was added to BT. On 2 October 2017, Eden HD was removed from the Sky lineup and replaced with Gold HD.

==On-air identity==
The UKTV Documentary identity focused around scenes from the landscape of Britain. The ident would first feature a close up shot, for example of a person or a stone, before pulling back to reveal the bigger picture: such as a busy rail station or a stone circle. This was then overlaid with the UKTV Documentary logo, consisting of the UKTV logo on top, and an upper case &#x27;DOCUMENTARY&#x27; tag below, aligned to the left of the screen. Alongside the idents, the channel had a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) of the same design and also featured a generic UKTV design for all promotions for the channel. The channels house colour was a blue, similar in shade to Azure, and would feature in numerous changing shades on the end boards of promotions.

The 2009–2024 Eden identity featured explorers in an unknown environment, such as the deep jungle or the Antarctic, before coming across a landscape, which the logo then forms onto. 

The 2024 identity films introduced in the rebrand to U&amp;Eden utilise aerial photography, similarly to those of Sky Mix.

==Programming==

The programming used on the original pay-TV Eden channel was mostly from the BBC archives, and so was therefore edited to fit the time slot: an original broadcast for an hour-long programme on the BBC might be as much as 58 minutes long, while the same programme here might be 42 minutes long without the commercials. Eden was renowned for showing blue-chip natural history but then moved into more scientific programmes, while keeping the blue-chip, cinematic identity. Eden has also produced its own exclusive programming, with the most recent series &quot;David Attenborough&#x27;s Natural Curiosities&quot;, produced by Humble Bee Films, broadcasting from January 2013.

===Programmes on U&amp;Eden===
From January 2025, Eden began to show a wider range of programming and now airs a range of reality, gameshows, drama and history programming from U&amp;W, U&amp;Drama, U&amp;Dave and U&amp;Yesterday, and as of February 2025, nature programming is only shown during the day on Saturdays.

=== U&amp;Eden programming ===
U&amp;Eden launched as a rebranded free-to-air service on Freeview on , with its programmes, usually scheduled in multi-episode blocks, now including:

<doc id="720952" wikidata="Q2037364" url="?curid=720952" title="Ottawa River (Auglaize River tributary)">
<text>The Ottawa River (Shawnee: Koskothiipi ) is a tributary of the Auglaize River, approximately long, in northwestern Ohio in the United States. The river is named for the Ottawa tribe of Native Americans who inhabited the area in the 18th century. It shares its name with another river in northwestern Ohio, the Ottawa River in Toledo, as well as the Ottawa River in Ontario &amp; Quebec, Canada.

It rises in northern Hardin County and flows northwest, then west-southwest through Lima. Approximately southeast of Lima it turns abruptly north, flowing into western Putnam County and joining the Auglaize from the southeast approximately northwest of Kalida.

The Ottawa River is also known locally and historically as &quot;Hog Creek&quot;. The origin of this name is ascribed to the following legend:
Alexander McKee, the British Indian Agent, who resided at the Machachac towns, on Mad River, during the incursion of General Logan from Kentucky in 1786, was obliged to flee with his effects. He had a large lot of swine, which were driven on to the borders of this stream, and when the Indians (Shawnee) came on they called the river Koshko Sepe, which in the Shawnee language signified &#x27;The Creek of the Hogs, or Hog Stream&#x27;.

<doc id="720965" wikidata="Q12060503" url="?curid=720965" title="UK Horizons">
<text>UK Horizons was a television channel broadcast in the United Kingdom, as part of the UKTV network of channels, showing mainly BBC documentaries. Most programmes were abridged for commercial timing purposes. It took its name from the BBC series &quot;Horizon&quot;, which formed a staple of its output in the early years.

==History==

It was launched on 1 November 1997 along with UK Arena and UK Style. It also produced extended versions of top BBC brands such as Top Gear and Tomorrow&#x27;s World. The launch editor was Bryher Scudamore and the deputy editor Eddie Tulasiewicz.

The channel was rebranded with a new look on 8 May 2001, with a one-hour timeshift service - UK Horizons +1 Hour, later shortened simply to UK Horizons +1, launching on the same day on Sky Digital. On 5 November, the channel&#x27;s broadcast hours were changed to 9:00am-3:00am (10:00am-4:00am for +1 Hour).

On 15 February 2002, UK Horizons +1 launched on Telewest, broadcasting between 6:00pm-6:00am, timesharing with UK Style + which also launched on Telewest on the same day. and on 29 May, had launched on NTL as well. In July 2002, UKTV announced an offshoot network to the channel - UK History, which would launch in October 2002.

On 3 February 2004, UKTV announced that the channel would close down and split into two new networks - UKTV Documentary and UKTV People. The changeover took place on 8 March 2004, with UKTV Documentary taking over the UK Horizons and UK Horizons +1 networks on Sky and Telewest and UKTV People launching as a standalone network. On NTL, UKTV People took over UK Horizons +1&#x27;s slot.

<text>The Butchart Gardens is a group of floral display gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, Canada, located near Victoria on Vancouver Island. The gardens receive over a million visitors each year. The gardens have been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

== History ==
Robert Pim Butchart (1856–1943) began manufacturing Portland cement in 1888 near his birthplace of Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. He and his wife Jennie Butchart (1866–1950) came to the west coast of Canada because of rich limestone deposits necessary for cement production. 
In 1904, they established their home near his quarry on Tod Inlet at the base of the Saanich Peninsula on Vancouver Island.

In 1907 Isaburo Kishida, a sixty-five-year-old garden designer from Yokohama, Japan, came to Victoria at the request of his son to build a tea garden for Esquimalt Gorge Park. This garden was wildly popular. Several prominent citizens, Jennie Butchart among them, commissioned Kishida to build Japanese gardens for their estates before Kishida returned to Japan in 1912.

In 1909, when the limestone quarry was exhausted, Jennie set about turning it into the Sunken Garden, which was completed in 1921. They named their home &quot;Benvenuto&quot; (&quot;welcome&quot; in Italian), and began to receive visitors to their gardens. In 1926, they replaced their tennis courts with an Italian garden and in 1929 they replaced their kitchen vegetable garden with a large rose garden to the design of Butler Sturtevant of Seattle. Samuel Maclure, who was consultant to the Butchart Gardens, reflected the aesthetic of the Renaissance Era and the English Arts and Crafts Movement.

In 1939, the Butcharts gave the Gardens to their grandson Ian Ross (1918–1997) on his 21st birthday. Ross was involved in the operation and promotion of the gardens until his death 58 years later.

In 1953, miles of underground wiring were laid to provide night illumination, to mark the 50th anniversary of The Gardens. In 1964, the ever-changing Ross Fountain was installed in the lower reservoir to celebrate the 60th anniversary. In 1994, the Canadian Heraldic Authority granted a coat of arms to the Butchart Gardens. In 2004, two totem poles were installed to mark the 100th anniversary, and The Gardens were designated as a national historic site.

Ownership of The Gardens remains within the Butchart family; the owner and managing director since 2001 is the Butcharts&#x27; great-granddaughter Robin-Lee Clarke.

In 1982 the Butchart Gardens was used as the inspiration for the gardens at the Canadian pavilion opened at Epcot Centre in Orlando Florida.

== Collections ==
=== Birds ===
While Mrs. Butchart collected plants, Mr. Butchart collected ornamental birds from all over the world, having a parrot in the house, ducks in the Star Pond and peacocks on the front lawn. He built several elaborate birdhouses for the gardens and trained pigeons on the site of the present-day Begonia Bower.

=== Statues ===
Several bronze statues are displayed in the gardens.

One, of a wild boar, purchased on a Mediterranean trip in 1973, was cast in Florence by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry, a replica of a 1620 bronze cast by Pietro Tacca. It is called &quot;Tacca&quot; in honor of the sculptor and, just as the original&#x27;s, its snout is shiny from the many visitors rubbing it for luck.

Another, nearby in front of the residence, of a donkey and foal is by Sirio Tofanari. A fountain statue of three sturgeon, also by Tofanari (cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry), is installed near the Japanese garden.

In 1993, &quot;Circle of Doves&quot;, which Ann-Lee Ross gave her husband Ian in 1991 to commemorate their 50th wedding anniversary, was installed in front of the begonia bower.

In the summer of 2008, The Gardens introduced the Jennie B, an electrically driven 12-passenger boat, which plies the local coastlines in the summer giving visitors an appreciation of the waterside history plus coastal aquatic plants and animals.

On December 1, 2009, the Children&#x27;s Pavilion and Rose Carousel were opened to the public. The Rose Carousel, crafted by Brass Ring Entertainment of Sun Valley, California is the only carousel on Vancouver Island. The menagerie includes thirty animals ranging from bears, to horses, to ostriches, to zebras, to cats and mirrors the world from which The Gardens draws its visitors. The designs were hand-picked by Robin Clarke, The Gardens&#x27; owner and great-granddaughter of Jennie Butchart, in consultation with an artist from North Carolina. The carvings were done by some of the few remaining carvers of carousel art. Each animal is carved from basswood and took many months to complete. There are also two chariots able to accommodate disabled persons.

The Rose Carousel is housed within the Children&#x27;s Pavilion, which has a dome with a clear span, a full-fronted glass façade and a roof planted with native plant species. The pavilion also has an event room for such things as children&#x27;s birthday parties.

== Entertainment ==
In the early days, weekly symphony concerts were hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Butchart. These were often held for guests of the family, but later attracted a larger audience. More recently, in the Summer Season (July and August) and during the Winter Holiday Season they provide a wide range of local entertainment, from jazz to classical music. Also, The Weeds, a band made up of staff members from The Gardens, sometimes plays during the Summer Season. In 1977, Ian Ross&#x27;s son Christopher (1944–2000) introduced firework shows accompanied by show tunes on summer Saturday evenings. During the Winter, lights and seasonal decorations adorn the gardens along with an ice-skating rink in the Waterwheel Square.

<text>The 1942 election to the Baseball Hall of Fame was the first election that was conducted in three years. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from 20th century players and elected Rogers Hornsby.

This was the only election or committee meeting scheduled between 1939 and 1945, as the hall of fame had inducted its required number of ten players from the 20th century following the 1939 election; the United States was involved in World War II during that time. The only other activities were the special election of Lou Gehrig following his 1939 farewell and the prompt election of Commissioner Landis following his death late in 1944.

==After the grand opening==
After the National Baseball Museum opened in 1939, it remained to be determined how the membership in its Hall of Fame would be determined in the future. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) had determined to vote every three years rather than annually, although it had voted in a special election to consider Lou Gehrig. That move was a widely criticized, as observers generally agreed that it was a good pace to elect about three recent players annually, as from 1936 to 1939.

After the Centennial Committee made six selections in 1939 from the figures of the 19th century, baseball&#x27;s Commissioner Landis completely revised the committee&#x27;s membership, designating it the Hall of Fame Committee and establishing it as the institution&#x27;s permanent governing body. From 1939 to 1944 its four members were Athletics owner and manager Connie Mack, Yankees president Ed Barrow, Braves president Bob Quinn, and sportswriter Sid Mercer. This committee was responsible, in its function as the Old-Timers Committee, for selecting additional worthy candidates from the 19th century, but it never convened during this 5-year period, and thereby selected no one. Inaction fostered greater complaints that the stars of the 1880s and 1890s were being ignored. The relative slight was tiny because the baseball writers voted only once between 1939 and 1945 and elected only one recent player.

==BBWAA election==

Members of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players active in the 20th century, provided they had been retired for one year. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.

A total of 233 ballots were cast, with 2,328 individual votes for 72 specific candidates, an average of 9.99 per ballot; 175 votes were required for election. Players of the 1900s and 1910s, who many voters felt should be given priority, dominated the voting to an even greater extent than they had in 1939. Of the top 22 candidates in the voting, 17 had not seen any substantial play since 1917; only 3 of the top 32 had played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Players who had been retired over 24 years – 42 of the 72 named – received 66% of the votes. The results were announced in January 1942. The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:

<text>Chilliwack is a Canadian rock band centered on the singer and guitarist Bill Henderson. They were active from 1970 to 1988; Henderson re-formed the band in 1997. The band started off with a progressive rock sound that incorporated elements of folk, indigenous, jazz and blues, before moving towards a more straight-ahead hard rock/pop rock sound by the mid-1970s. Their six best-selling songs were &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly at Night&quot;, &quot;Crazy Talk&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band&#x27;s line-up has changed many times.

==History==
The band originated in Vancouver, British Columbia. The members of the C-FUN Classics changed the band&#x27;s name to The Collectors when Bill Henderson joined in 1966. Their psychedelic self-titled debut album yielded the minor hit &quot;Lydia Purple&quot;. Their second album was based on the musical score written by the band for &quot;Grass and Wild Strawberries&quot;, a stage play by Canadian playwright George Ryga.

Vocalist Howie Vickers left the Collectors in 1969; the remaining members formed the band Chilliwack in 1970, Chilliwack being a Salish term meaning &quot;valley of many streams&quot; and the name of a city east of Vancouver in the Fraser Valley. Chilliwack released its debut album, &quot;Chilliwack&quot;, in 1970. 

Lead guitarist Bill Henderson led the remaining former Collectors members: Glenn Miller (bass, guitar, backing vocals), Ross Turney (drums) and Claire Lawrence (flute, saxophone, keyboards, backing vocals); while he provided most of the vocals and did most of the composing. During 1970, Miller briefly left the band, who were joined on the road by Robbie King (keyboards, bass) and played at Expo &#x27;70 in Japan and other gigs across Canada.

In 1971 bassist Rick Kilburn played live with Chilliwack for a short time before Miller returned later that same year when Lawrence departed. New member Howard Froese (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) joined in 1973.

The band released several moderately successful records. Hit singles in Canada included &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;, which entered Cashbox January 22, 1972 (and was their first US charting single, peaking at #75 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972), &quot;Crazy Talk&quot; (#98 in the US in January 1975), and &quot;Fly at Night&quot; (#75 in the US in May 1977). The track &quot;Rain-o&quot;, a blues-based composition that appeared in different versions on their debut album, &quot;Chilliwack&quot; (June 1970) and the later &quot;Dreams, Dreams, Dreams&quot; (January 1977), was a well-known concert favourite, but far too long to be released as a single.

Chilliwack&#x27;s debut was followed by two more albums: &quot;Chilliwack&quot; in September 1971 and &quot;All Over You&quot; in December 1972.

In April 1974 their album &quot;Riding High&quot; on Goldfish Records (Terry Jacks&#x27; label) contained one of their biggest hits, &quot;Crazy Talk&quot;, which was produced by Jacks. This album was not released in the US until early 1975 (on the Sire Records label), where it was retitled &quot;Chilliwack&quot; (their third U.S. release to bear that title).

Chilliwack had a difficult time sustaining success because of constant changes of label. The two Collectors albums were on Warner Brothers and Chilliwack&#x27;s first five albums were on four different labels in Canada: Parrot, A&amp;M, Goldfish and Casino Records.

&quot;Rockerbox&quot;, their fifth album, was released in December 1975 on Sire Records in the US and (with a different cover) on the little-known Casino Records label in Canada. It was Chilliwack&#x27;s least successful album in Canada.

The band was then signed to Vancouver&#x27;s Mushroom Records, with distribution throughout North America. After completing one album for the label, &quot;Dreams, Dreams, Dreams&quot;, Chilliwack began work on their seventh album, to be titled &quot;Lights from the Valley&quot;. The first attempt at recording proved unsatisfactory, leading to discord among the band members. Froese was replaced by Brian MacLeod, who contributed guitar, drums, keyboards and backing vocals. The album was re-recorded; with some of Froese&#x27;s vocal and guitar work, as well as percussion from session drummer Eddie Tuduri, included in the final mix. By the time of the record&#x27;s release, bassist Glenn Miller and drummer Ross Turney had left the group. Mushroom was also having financial problems which hampered the promotion of the album after its release in June 1978.

Drummer Skip Layton and former Prism bassist Ab Bryant were recruited to perform with Henderson, MacLeod and Jamie Bowers (guitar and keyboards, who had also played on &quot;Lights from the Valley&quot;) in Chilliwack&#x27;s 1978 live gigs. Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant then began working on Chilliwack&#x27;s eighth album in 1979, joined by John Roles (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and drummer Bucky Berger. The Mushroom label went bankrupt abruptly shortly after their album &quot;Breakdown in Paradise&quot; was released in December 1979. Berger was replaced by Rick Taylor and the line-up of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, Roles and Taylor toured into 1980.

Chilliwack then signed with Solid Gold Records in Canada and Millennium Records in the U.S. in 1981 as a trio (Henderson/MacLeod/Bryant) and enjoyed its greatest success with this line-up, releasing the albums &quot;Wanna Be a Star&quot; (September 1981) and &quot;Opus X&quot; (October 1982). The singles &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot; (Their first US Top 40 hit, peaking at #22 in December 1981), &quot;I Believe&quot; (US #33 in March 1982), and &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do (When I&#x27;m Gone)&quot; (US #41 in December 1982) were popular both in Canada and in the U.S. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote:

Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant were joined by drummer Paul Delaney in the fall of 1981 through early 1982 for US promotional appearances on TV shows, like &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, before heading out on the road later in 1982 with an expanded line-up of Henderson, MacLeod, Bryant, Joey Franco (drums), Glenn Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dennis Grayson (keyboards, backing vocals).

Henderson and MacLeod received a Best Producer Juno Award for &quot;Opus X&quot;. However, echoing the Mushroom problems, Millennium Records then collapsed. In early 1983, MacLeod and Bryant left the band to devote more time to their other project, the Headpins (with Denise McCann and then Darby Mills as lead vocalists). Chilliwack&#x27;s last studio recording, &quot;Look In Look Out&quot;, was released in July 1984 with Henderson as the only continuing member. He was joined by session players Ashley Mulford (guitar, backing vocals, from the band Sad Café), Richard Gibbs (keyboards, from the group Oingo Boingo), Mo Foster (bass), Simon Phillips (drums) and Tom Keenlyside (saxophone), with additional vocals provided by Mark LaFrance, Saffron &amp; Camille Henderson, Dustin Keller and Bob Rock.

By 1985, the band was without a record deal, and Henderson cobbled together a touring line-up of former member Claire Lawrence (sax, backing vocals), Jerry Adolphe (drums), Brian Newcombe (bass), Robbie Gray (keyboards, backing vocals) and Dave Pickell (keyboards). Pickell was replaced almost immediately by another former member John Roles (guitar, keyboards). This grouping played mostly in Canadian clubs and smaller venues until Henderson disbanded the group in December 1988. The following year, Henderson formed the folk-rock supergroup UHF.

On October 6, 1991 Henderson joined fellow rockers Loverboy, Bryan Adams, Colin James and Chrissy Steele at a benefit show at Vancouver&#x27;s 86 Street Music Hall to raise over $50,000 for Henderson&#x27;s former Chilliwack bandmate, Brian MacLeod, who was fighting cancer and undergoing treatment at a Houston medical clinic. MacLeod died on April 25, 1992, aged 39.

After the band had been dormant for nearly a decade, Henderson decided to launch a new Chilliwack line-up in 1997, made up of himself, Adolphe (drums), Doug Edwards (bass, backing vocals), and Roy &#x27;Bim&#x27; Forbes (guitar, backing vocals, from UHF). Forbes was succeeded on guitar in 1998 by Bill&#x27;s brother, Ed, and Chilliwack released a new live album, &quot;There and Back - Live&quot;, in 2003.

Chilliwack performed at 2005&#x27;s Voyageur Days Festival in Mattawa, Ontario, where they appeared with Moxy, Toronto, Trooper, Goddo, Killer Dwarfs and Ray Lyell for the thirtieth anniversary of Moxy&#x27;s debut album release.

On May 24, 2010 the band members (Bill Henderson, Ed Henderson, Doug Edwards and Jerry Adolphe) were joined by former members Roy &#x27;Bim&#x27; Forbes, Ab Bryant and Claire Lawrence, plus Howard Froese&#x27;s son Tyson on acoustic guitar (standing in for his father, who had died of cancer in the mid-1990s), and Collectors singer Howie Vickers for a Chilliwack 40th Anniversary show at the River Rock Show Theatre in Richmond, British Columbia.

Chilliwack&#x27;s original bassist, Glenn Miller, died on March 4, 2011, in Toronto after suffering from muscular dystrophy.

In 2015 a new music video by Chilliwack for the song &quot;Take Back This Land&quot; was released. The song became a rallying call during the 2015 Canadian federal election.

Henderson occasionally does duo shows with Claire Lawrence. Chilliwack continues to play, mostly at outdoor gatherings and festivals.

Doug Edwards died at his home in Vancouver at the age of 70 on November 11, 2016, after a long illness. He was succeeded in Chilliwack by Gord Maxwell (formerly with Ian Tyson and One Horse Blue), who began filling in for Edwards in 2013.

Matt Bryant, son of former Chilliwack bass player Ab Bryant, is the singer/songwriter and founding member of the Canadian roots/folk band Headwater.

In 2019 Chilliwack was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame

On January 22, 2022 Chilliwack played Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall with their friend Geoff Hicks briefly filling in on drums for an ill Adolphe.

<text>Ali Salem al-Beidh (; born 10 February 1939) is a Yemeni politician who served as the General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) in South Yemen and as Vice President of Yemen following the unification in 1990. He left the unification government in 1993, sparking the 1994 civil war in Yemen and then went into exile in Oman. He is a leader of the Southern independence movement known as Al Hirak.

==Leadership in South Yemen==
He studied for a Commerce degree and became a School Teacher in Mukalla in 1961. He joined the National Liberation Front in 1963 as the Local Committee founder in Mukalla, and went underground in 1965. In 1966 he was admitted into the Hadramawt Provincial Committee of the NLF. After independence, he joined the YSP. In 1971 he was selected as the General Secretary of the Hadhramawt Provincial Committee and was admitted into the YSP National Central Committee as a Candidate-Member. Selected as Full Member of the Central Committee in 1975, well as Deputy Minister for School Education and Vocational Training. In 1977, he was admitted as Candidate Member for the YSP Politburo and a full Politburo member in 1981. Ali took the top position in the YSP following a 12-day 1986 civil war between forces loyal to former chairman Abdul Fattah Ismail and then-chairman Ali Nasir Muhammad. An Ismail ally, he took control after Muhammad&#x27;s defeat and defection and Ismail&#x27;s disappearance. In a coup that took the lives of anywhere from 4,000 to 10,000 people, Ali was one of the few high-ranking officials who survived.

Suffering a loss of more than half its aid from the Soviet Union from 1986 to 1989 and interest in possible oil reserves on the border between the countries, Ali&#x27;s government worked toward unification with North Yemen officials.

==Unification and Civil War==
Following the unification of South Yemen with the Yemen Arab Republic in 1990, he took up the position of vice-president in the transition government of unified Yemen. But in 1993, Ali quit the government and returned to the former Southern capital of Aden, claiming that the new government was systematically marginalizing the southern people and ignoring the needs of the south. On 21 May 1994, as the South&#x27;s military position weakened, Ali declared the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He served as the only President of the DRY, from 21 May to 7 July 1994. Ali fled to neighbouring Oman after the secession failed.

==South Yemen movement==
After fifteen years of living in exile, Ali Salim al-Beidh resumed his political career on the eve of the 19th anniversary of the Yemeni unification. This came amid highly escalating tensions in the south, with clashes and violence between protesters and Yemeni security forces. In a televised speech from Kitzbühel, Austria, the former President called for a return of South Yemen. Since then he has called for several demonstrations to demonstrate the strength of the movement. These have continued into 2011. As a result of his increased involvement, he lost his right to stay in Oman after violating the conditions of his citizenship. Following the 2011 Yemeni uprising, he renewed calls for reinstating South Yemen as a separate country.

<doc id="720997" wikidata="Q1071835" url="?curid=720997" title="Chicago Blues Festival">
<text>The Chicago Blues Festival is an annual event held in June, that features three days of performances by top-tier blues musicians, both old favorites and the up-and-coming. It is hosted by the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (formerly the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Special Events), and occurs in early June. Until 2017, the event took place at and around Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park, adjacent to the Lake Michigan waterfront east of the Loop in Chicago. In 2017, the festival was moved to the nearby Millennium Park.

==History of the festival==
Chicago has a storied history with blues that goes back generations stemming from the Great Migration from the South and particularly the Mississippi Delta region in pursuit of advancement and better career possibilities for musicians. Created by Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Lois Weisberg, the festival began in 1984, a year after the death of McKinley Morganfield, better known as Muddy Waters, who is generally considered &quot;the father of Chicago blues&quot;. Each year the organizers choose a theme, generally to honor a recently departed blues musician. Obviously, Chicago blues acts are common. In 2015, the festival celebrated the centenary of the births of Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. The Centennial Tribute featured several musicians who had played with Muddy Waters as well as his sons Mud Morganfield and Big Bill Morganfield, with Alex Dixon playing bass. Also, in keeping with the blues&#x27; influence on other musical genres, there are some soul, jazz blues and blues-rock acts.

There was no festival in 2020.

Since those early beginnings the festival has risen to a status that the City of Chicago has billed as the world&#x27;s largest free concert of its kind, and the largest of the city&#x27;s music festivals. For many years through 2016, the festival&#x27;s &quot;Route 66 Roadhouse&quot; side stage was located a few yards north of historic old U.S. Route 66 (Jackson Boulevard, with traffic closed off for the festival), and a block west of Route 66&#x27;s former eastern terminus at US 41 Lake Shore Drive.

<text>Jason Terrance Phillips (born May 27, 1975), better known by his stage name Jadakiss (, ), is an American rapper who began his career in the 1990s and formed the hip hop trio the Lox alongside Styles P and Sheek Louch in 1994. The group signed with Puff Daddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Records, an imprint of Arista Records to release their debut studio album, &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot; (1998); their second album, &quot;We Are the Streets&quot; (2000) was released by Ruff Ryders Entertainment, an imprint of Interscope Records. Both peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and yielded critical praise; their two subsequent albums, &quot;Filthy America... It&#x27;s Beautiful&quot; (2016) and &quot;Living Off Xperience&quot; (2020) were both released by Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation and met with continued praise.

After the Lox&#x27;s second album, the trio each began pursuing solo careers, and Jadakiss signed with Ruff Ryders as a solo act to release his first two solo albums, &quot;Kiss Tha Game Goodbye&quot; (2001) and &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (2004). Both met with positive critical reception, the latter debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned his highest-charting single, &quot;Why?&quot; (featuring Anthony Hamilton). He then signed with Def Jam Recordings to release his third and fourth albums &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; (2009) and &quot;Top 5 Dead or Alive&quot; (2015), which peaked at numbers three and four on the chart, respectively. He has since released the collaborative album &quot;Friday on Elm Street&quot; (2017) with hometown rapper Fabolous, and his fifth solo album, &quot;Ignatius&quot; (2020) both to critical acclaim.

== Early life ==
Jason Terrance Phillips was born on May 27, 1975, in Yonkers, New York, and had an interest in hip hop from an early age. At age 12, he began hustling after his parents asked him to earn his own money. He began freestyle rapping for money after watching other people do it on the street corner. While freestyling, he eventually met longtime friends Sheek Louch and Styles P.

==Career==
Phillips quickly developed a small underground fanbase and at the age of 12, entered himself into a freestyle competition in Florida where he attracted the attention of the owners of Ruff Ryders. Along with Styles and Louch, he formed a group known as The Warlox, and the trio began rapping together. They eventually met Mary J. Blige, who, impressed with their lyrics, handed their demo to Puff Daddy, who signed the group to his label Bad Boy. Phillips initially used the name J. Ski; &quot;Jadakiss&quot; originated as a mispronunciation or spoonerism of his name.

===1994–2000: The Lox===
Upon signing with Bad Boy, Puff Daddy shortened the group&#x27;s name from The Warloxs to simply The Lox. They made their first appearance on Main Source&#x27;s 1994 LP &quot;Fuck What You Think&quot; on the track &quot;Set it Off&quot;. They immediately began writing and performing on hit songs with fellow Bad Boy artists, including Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot; and &quot;I Got the Power&quot;, Mase&#x27;s &quot;24 Hrs. to Live&quot;, Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot;, Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Off My Mind&quot; and The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Last Day&quot;. The group developed a close relationship with B.I.G., during which time Jadakiss especially was taken under his wing. The Lox&#x27;s first hit song was a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. in the wake of his 1997 death, titled &quot;We&#x27;ll Always Love Big Poppa&quot;. The song was chosen as the B-side to Puff Daddy&#x27;s smash hit B.I.G. tribute song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, and received widespread commercial success, achieving multi-platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The success and reception of the song opened the door for them to write more of their own songs, and in 1998, the Lox released their debut studio album, &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot;. The album was both a commercial and critical success, peaking at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and went on to achieve platinum status. Though the record was successful, The Lox grew unhappy with Bad Boy and Puff Daddy&#x27;s glossy, radio friendly production, feeling it conflicted with their grimier street aesthetic. Following the release of their debut album, the group left the label to sign with Ruff Ryders. They released their second album, We Are The Streets, in 2000, through Ruff Ryders. The album was once again a success, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 2 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart. It featured production from Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, and spawned one single, &quot;Ryde or Die, Bitch&quot;, featuring fellow Ruff Ryders artist Eve.

===2001–2007: Solo career===

Jadakiss began embarking on a solo career in 2001 and his debut album, &quot;Kiss Tha Game Goodbye&quot;, was released in August 2001 on the Ruff Ryders/Interscope label. The album featured popular guests and producers such as DJ Premier, The Alchemist, DMX, Eve, Snoop Dogg, Nas and Swizz Beatz and was commercially successful, going on to be certified gold by the RIAA and selling over 200,000 copies during its first week of release. Despite commercial success, the album received negative reception from critics who criticised the album for being repetitive and uninspired. Jadakiss has acknowledged the criticism as valid, saying the record was done less out of inspiration but rather out of contractual obligations to Bad Boy. The album produced three singles, &quot;We Gonna Make It&quot; featuring Styles P, &quot;Knock Yourself Out&quot; and &quot;Put Ya Hands Up&quot;. Jadakiss followed this album with &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, released in June 2004. It features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Eminem, The Lox, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Nate Dogg, DJ Quik and more. His song &quot;Why?&quot;, featuring Anthony Hamilton and produced by Havoc of Mobb Deep, became one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits, spawning a remix featuring Styles P, Common and Nas. &quot;Why?&quot; remains Jadakiss&#x27; biggest hit, peaking at #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song also garnered controversy for a line in which Jadakiss claims that he believes George W. Bush planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Another single from the record, &quot;U Make Me Wanna&quot;, featuring Mariah Carey peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was both a commercial and critical success, receiving better reviews than his previous album and debuted at number 1 on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums charts. In late 2007, Jadakiss signed to Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc-A-Fella Records, a move Jay had been trying to arrange for a long time. The move came on the heels of increased D-Block/Roc-a-Fella collaborations; in 2006, Jadakiss and former rival Beanie Sigel collaborated on DJ Khaled&#x27;s album &quot;Listennn... the Album&quot;, and in 2007, on Freeway&#x27;s album &quot;Free At Last&quot;. Styles P appeared on a radio freestyle with Freeway and Sigel, and also appeared briefly in the video for Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;American Gangster&quot; single &quot;Roc Boys&quot;, in which he throws up the famous Roc-A-Fella sign, &quot;the Diamond&quot;.

In 2004, Jadakiss and Fat Joe were featured on a song by Ja Rule titled &quot;New York&quot;. In this song, Ja Rule accuses 50 Cent of being a snitch, and also takes shots at G-Unit. In turn, 50 Cent released a song titled &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; in which he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss among others for performing on the song. This caused Jadakiss to release numerous 50 Cent diss tracks, including &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, &quot;Shots Fired&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry Ms. Jackson&quot;. 50 Cent along with his G-Unit crew responded with songs such as &quot;I Run New York&quot;, &quot;Window Shopper&quot;, and &quot;Death Wish&quot; by Lloyd Banks. Jadakiss challenged 50 Cent to an onstage battle in Madison Square Garden for 1 million dollars, but 50 Cent declined. The feud was later resolved, with Jadakiss and G-Unit performing together at 50 Cent&#x27;s ThisIs50 Festival on October 3, 2009.

In 2004, Bill O&#x27;Reilly called Jadakiss a &quot;smear merchant&quot; due to lyrics in his hit song &quot;Why?&quot;, in which Jadakiss lyrically implied George W. Bush coordinated the September 11 attacks, with the line &quot;Why do niggas push pounds of powder? Why did Bush knock down the towers?&quot; Jadakiss said the line was a metaphor for Bush administration not doing enough to stop the attacks. In the music video for &quot;Why?&quot;, a man holds up a picket sign reading &quot;Buck Fush&quot; (a spoonerism of &quot;Fuck Bush&quot;). O&#x27;Reilly took the position that the President should be allowed to sue Jadakiss for slander. The track was eventually banned on some radio stations or played with the lyrics in question censored.

In 2005, Jadakiss released the 50 Cent diss track &quot;Checkmate&quot; under Ruff Ryders and Interscope as a promotional single on March 9, 2005. Despite releasing a single in 2005, Jadakiss focused on appearing on other artists&#x27; records. He contributed on records for Mariah Carey, Styles P, David Banner and also featured on Cuban Link&#x27;s album &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, appearing on the track &quot;Talk About It&quot;.

=== 2009–2015: &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; and &quot;Top 5 Dead or Alive&quot; ===

In 2009, Jadakiss released his much-delayed and anticipated third studio album, &quot;The Last Kiss&quot;. The first single, &quot;By My Side&quot; featuring Ne-Yo was released in October 2008. Two more singles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Me&quot; and &quot;Death Wish&quot; featuring Lil Wayne, were released in 2009. One more single, &quot;Who&#x27;s Real&quot;, featuring Swizz Beatz and OJ Da Juiceman released later that year. In 2010, Jadakiss left Roc-A-Fella records. In 2011, he was featured on two DJ Khaled tracks, one of them titled &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over Til It&#x27;s Over&quot;, featuring Mary J. Blige and Fabolous, and the remix of &quot;Welcome to My Hood&quot;, also featuring Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Twista, Mavado, Birdman, Ace Hood, Fat Joe, Game, Bun B and Waka Flocka Flame. On April 26, 2012, Jadakiss released his mixtape &quot;Consignment&quot;, hosted by DJ Drama.

On June 4, 2013, Jadakiss released the first single from his by then upcoming fourth studio album, &quot;Top 5 Dead or Alive&quot; titled &quot;Big Boy Dialogue&quot;, featuring vocals from The-Dream. The album was scheduled to be released during September or October 2013, but after much delay, the album was finally released on November 20, 2015. It features guest appearances from Akon, Future, Jeezy, Lil Wayne, Ne-Yo, Nas, Nipsey Hussle, Styles P, Puff Daddy, Sheek Louch, Swizz Beatz, Wiz Khalifa and Young Buck, and was supported by 2 singles, &quot;Jason&quot; featuring Swizz Beatz, and Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; New featuring Ne-Yo and Nipsey Hussle. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200, and received positive reviews from critics.

===2016–present: The Lox reunion, &quot;Friday on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;Ignatius&quot; and &quot;Mr. &quot;Verzuz&quot;&quot;===

In 2016, The Lox released their first album in 16 years, title &quot;Filthy America…It&#x27;s Beautiful&quot;. The album featured guest appearances from Fetty Wap, Mobb Deep and Gucci Mane, and peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200.

On February 29, 2016, Fabolous posted a picture on Instagram with Jadakiss with the caption, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason coming soon&quot;, hinting at the release of a joint project with Jadakiss, titled &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. On April 2, 2016, Fabolous and Jadakiss released a freestyle of Future&#x27;s &quot;Wicked&quot; from &quot;Purple Reign&quot; that was scheduled appear on &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, but did not make the final cut of the album. They also revealed that it would not be a mixtape, but instead a full album. On October 31, 2017, the album&#x27;s first and only single, &quot;Stand Up&quot; featuring Future was released. On November 21, 2017, it was announced that the album title was changed to &quot;Friday on Elm Street&quot;. The album was released on November 24, 2017, and features guest appearances from Future, Jeezy, Styles P, French Montana and Yo Gotti.

On March 6, 2020, Jadakiss&#x27;s fifth studio album Ignatius was released. On June 29 of the same year, Jadakiss defeated Fabolous in a battle on Timbaland and Swizz Beatz&#x27; Verzuz held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following year, Jadakiss returned for another Verzuz battle, this time alongside the Lox against The Diplomats (DipSet) live with an audience at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden. The Lox were widely regarded as winning decisively, with decisive moments including Jadakiss calling out the Diplomats for using full songs including their own vocals instead of TV tracks and then performing his freestyle over The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot;, originally released on his 2010 mixtape &quot;The Champ Is Here, Pt. 3&quot;, and answering Cam&#x27;ron&#x27;s remark before performing &quot;Welcome to New York City&quot; that the Lox did not have a New York record that could not beat it with his verse on &quot;New York&quot; (Jadakiss also performed the verse when Fat Joe – who was in the audience for the Lox-Diplomats Verzuz – and Ja Rule faced each other in the subsequent Verzuz at the same venue).

Following their victory, streams of Lox music increased by 215%, including Jadakiss&#x27; &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot; freestyle (both studio and live versions) being added to the iTunes Store and Apple Music 11 years after its initial release. Jadakiss was also dubbed &quot;Mr. &quot;Verzuz&quot;&quot; after becoming the first artist to win two battles and was able to restructure his Def Jam contract. Just over a year after the battle while they were performing at LL Cool J&#x27;s Rock The Bells festival at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, Jadakiss presented Styles P and Sheek Louch with Lox championship rings and unveiled his.
==Business ventures==
Along with longtime friend and business associate, Jay Jackson and Jadakiss launched an online multimedia creative collective called SoRaspy that also serves as an umbrella company for his business endeavors which include an online publication, record label, apparel, and a YouTube channel.

Reinvesting in their community, in the summer of 2014, Jadakiss and Styles P opened a juice bar in Yonkers, New York, called Juices For Life. Together, they have gone on to open two more branches in The Bronx and one in Brooklyn.

In October 2022, Jadakiss launched a family-owned coffee company called Kiss Café with his father and son.

==Personal life==
===Legal issues===
On July 5, 2004, Jadakiss was arrested in North Carolina on marijuana and illicit gun possession charges. Several months later, he reached a plea agreement on misdemeanor charges and was ordered to pay a $900 fine.

On October 7, 2006, Jadakiss was once again arrested in his hometown of Yonkers, New York on gun and drug possession charges. A Yonkers Police Department spokesperson said Jadakiss was one of four men sitting in a 2006 Toyota Camry that was parked near the intersection of Nepperhan Avenue and Elm Street in Yonkers at around 5 a.m. Saturday. Officers said the vehicle&#x27;s driver was behaving oddly and said they noticed a strong odor of marijuana while approaching the car. Inside the vehicle, police found a .38 caliber revolver that had been reported stolen. According to The Associated Press, the weapon was loaded. All occupants were charged with possession of a stolen firearm; Jadakiss was also charged with possession of marijuana (a small amount was found on his person). The driver, Darnell Frazier, was charged with driving under the influence. The other two men in the vehicle are listed as Benjamin Lockhart and Kristian Smith. All were remanded to Westchester County Jail and were held until at least Tuesday of the following week, when they were due in court.

===House raid===
Police arrested two men on multiple felony charges after they raided Jadakiss&#x27; Yonkers, New York apartment and found heroin (5 grams) and marijuana (6.5 pounds). Jadakiss was neither present during the investigation, nor wanted by the law enforcement agencies. The incident took place on the morning of August 24, 2009, and started when an investigation revealed the presence of marijuana inside the vehicle driven by two men. Both men were reportedly in police custody and had been criminally charged.

<text>The Blanchard River is a tributary of the Auglaize River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. It drains a primarily rural farming area in the watershed of Lake Erie. Much of the length of the river can be navigated by canoe.

It rises in central Hardin County, on the northern outskirts of Kenton. It flows generally north for its first into eastern Hancock County, where it turns sharply to the west. It flows west through Findlay and past Ottawa. It joins the Auglaize from the east in western Putnam County approximately north of Cloverdale at .

== History ==
The river is named for Jean Jacques Blanchard (1720–1802), a French tailor who settled among the Shawnee along the river in 1769. Fort Findlay, an American outpost in the War of 1812, was constructed along the river in 1812 at the site of the present-day city of Findlay.

In 1908, Tell Taylor wrote &quot;Down by the Old Mill Stream&quot;, a popular song of the early 20th Century and a barbershop favorite, while sitting on the banks of the Blanchard River.

Around 1939 numerous projects by the Works Progress Administration improved the river near Findlay, including construction of two major bridges, clearing substantial existing pollution, and building a sewage treatment plant to reduce ongoing pollution.

== Flooding ==
In August 2007 flooding along the Blanchard River caused more than $100 million in damage in Findlay and an estimated $12 million in damage in Ottawa. Flooding in Ottawa is aggravated by the low bridge carrying County Road I-9 in Putnam County. It traps debris, forming a dam during floods. Flooding also caused damage in Findlay in March 2011.

On November 28, 2012, officials from Hancock and Putnam counties traveled to Washington D.C. to lobby for $1.7 million in federal funding to complete phase three of the Blanchard River Flood Mitigation study.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Blanchard River has also been known as:
* &quot;Quegh-tua-wa,&quot; in Odawa 
* &quot;Queghtuwa,&quot; in Odawa 
* Blanchard Fork 
* Blanchard&#x27;s Fork 
* Blanchards Fork 
* Quegh-tu-wa 
* Sha-po-qua-te-sepe 
* Sha-po-qua-te-sepi 
* Tailor&#x27;s River

In 1937 it was combined with the new &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; (SKL). There were two re-organisations, in November 1939 and May 1944. It was part of the .

==Organization==
The OKM was broadly divided into six sections:
* At the top was the Oberbefehlshaber der Marine (OBdM) – the Commander-in-Chief and his staff, with responsibility for liaison with the OKW, and including planning, technical, engineering, medical, economic, research, propaganda and personnel departments.
* The Seekriegsleitung (SKL) (&quot;Naval Warfare Command&quot;) was formed on 1 April 1937. Originally closely linked with both the OBdM and the &quot;Marinekommandoamt&quot;, with the Commander-in-Chief (OBdM) also the Chief of the SKL, and the Chief of the &quot;Marinekommandoamt&quot; doubling as the SKL Chief of Staff. From 23 August 1939 the offices were split and the &quot;Marinekommandoamt&quot; became subordinate to the SKL with its own Chief and staff. The SKL led the planning and execution of naval warfare and directed the distribution of naval forces, though during the war its authority was limited to non-domestic sea-areas, and in February 1943 when Dönitz was appointed OBdM it also lost control over U-boat operations. On 1 May 1944 the Chief of Staff of the SKL was re-designated the &quot;Chef der Seekriegsleitung&quot;. The office was then tasked with the command of fleet units operating as transports, blockade runners, auxiliary cruisers and supply shipping.
* The Marinekommandoamt (&quot;Naval Command Department&quot;) was formed on 11 January 1936 with the formation of the OKM, but had previously existed in the &quot;Marineleitung&quot; since 1920. Subordinate to the &quot;Oberbefehshaber der Marine&quot;, from April 1937 the &quot;Chef des Marinekommandoamt&quot; also served as the Chief of Staff of the SKL. In mid-1939 the two offices were split and the &quot;Marinekommandoamt&quot; received a new Chief who was subordinate to the Chief of Staff of the SKL. From 1942 the office was also known as the &quot;Quartiermeisteramt&quot; and from 20 April 1943 the Chief was re-titled &quot;Admiralquartiermeister&quot;. On 1 May 1944 the office was officially re-designated the &quot;Quartiermeisteramt&quot;. As well as naval operations the &quot;Marinekommandoamt&quot; had responsibilities in manning, supply, intelligence, training, and in coastal and air defence.
* The Marinewaffenamt (&quot;Naval Weapons Department&quot;) was formed in 1934, and was renamed the &quot;Marinewaffenhauptamt&quot; (&quot;Naval Weapons Head Department&quot;) in 1939, and to &quot;Kriegsmarine-Rüstung&quot; (&quot;Navy Armaments&quot;) in 1944, and oversaw the development, testing and production of naval weapons of all kinds, as well as electronic counter-measures and radio communications.
* The Allgemeines Marineamt (&quot;General Navy Department&quot;) founded in January 1936, renamed &quot;Allgemeine Marinehauptamt&quot; (&quot;General Navy Head Department&quot;) in November 1939, and again to &quot;Kriegsmarine-Wehr&quot; (&quot;Navy Defense&quot;) in 1944, was concerned mainly with administrative matters; it included legal, medical, economic, construction and export departments.
* The Konstruktionsamt (&quot;Construction Department&quot;), formed in 1936, was renamed &quot;Amt Kriegsschiffsbau&quot; (&quot;Department of Warship Construction&quot;) in 1939, and later the same year to &quot;Hauptamt Kriegsschiffsbau&quot; (&quot;Head Department of Warship Construction&quot;), before reverting to its previous designation in 1944. As its name suggests this department dealt with the construction of new vessels for the navy, dealing with the design and engineering of ships and U-boats, working with suppliers and shipyards, and liaising with the Ministry of Armaments and War Production.
The &quot;Flottenchef&quot; (Fleet commander) of the Kriegsmarine was also considered a serving member of the OKM.

==List of commanders==
Commander-in-Chief of the OKM


===Flags of the Commander-in-Chief===
On 7 November 1935 a decree was issued by Werner von Blomberg, the &quot;Reichskriegsminister&quot; and Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces ordering the introduction of a new pattern of flag for use by the Commander-in-Chief of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The flag consisted of a white square on which was displayed a large black Iron Cross. Placed behind it were two straight bladed unsheathed swords in bright yellow, crossed at right angles to each other. The flag was modified when on 1 April 1939 Erich Raeder rose to the rank of &quot;Großadmiral&quot;. The flag continued to be in use when Karl Dönitz came into this position on 30 January 1943. The swords were replaced by a pair of Admiral&#x27;s batons crossed at right angles. Superimposed over both the crossed batons and the Iron Cross was a &quot;Wehrmachtsadler&quot; (&quot;Armed Forces&#x27; Eagle&quot;) in gold, facing towards the hoist. On 30 January 1943 a further special flag was introduced for &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Raeder in order to represent his position as &quot;Admiralinspekteur&quot; of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. It was in the same design as for the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, but with the addition of a wide light blue border.

<text>Santa Cruz del Quiché is a city, with a population of 78,279 (2018 census), in Guatemala. It serves as the capital of the El Quiché department and the municipal seat of Santa Cruz del Quiché municipality. The city is located at , at an elevation of 2,021 m (6,631 feet) above sea level. It has an airport, Quiché Airport, located just south of the city.

==History==
Santa Cruz del Quiché was founded by Pedro de Alvarado, a companion and second in-command of conquistador Hernán Cortés, after he burned down the nearby Maya capital city of Q&#x27;umarkaj (or Utatlán, in the Nahuatl language). The oldest buildings, including a large cathedral and clock tower in the central plaza, were constructed out of the stones of the Q&#x27;umarkaj ruins by the Dominicans. Some think it likely that it was in Santa Cruz where a group of anonymous K&#x27;iche&#x27; nobles of the Nim Ch&#x27;okoj class transcribed the Popol Vuh, the sacred text of the Maya.

In Santa Cruz, the former rulers of Q&#x27;umarkaj were reduced to the status of peasant.

=== Pacific conquest by the Dominican friars===
On his second visit to Guatemala, in 1537, friar Bartolomé de las Casas, O.P. wanted to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because it had not been possible to conquer the land by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas&#x27;s group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, reaching as far as Chahal. Through the efforts of Las Casas&#x27; missionaries the so-called &quot;Land of War&quot; came to be called &quot;Verapaz&quot;, &quot;True Peace&quot;. Las Casas&#x27;s strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitlán and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Francisco Marroquín who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission.

=== Monastery and doctrine of Order of Preachers ===


After the conquest, the Spanish crown focused on the Catholic indoctrination of the natives. Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called &quot;Indian doctrines&quot; or simply &quot;doctrines&quot;. Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach the Catholic faith to the natives, and then transfer the settlements to secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism to the natives. When the natives were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain.

However, this plan never materialized, mainly because the Spanish crown lost control of the regular orders as soon as their friars set course to America. Shielded by their apostolic privileges granted to convert natives into Catholicism, the missionaries only responded to their order local authorities, and never to that of the Spanish government or the secular bishops. The orders local authorities, in turn, only dealt with their own order and not with the Spanish crown. Once a doctrine had been established, the protected their own economic interests, even against those of the King and thus, the doctrines became Indian towns that remains unaltered for the rest of the Spanish colony.

The doctrines were founded at the friars discretion, given that they were completely at liberty to settle communities provided the main purpose was to eventually transfer it as a secular parish which would be tithing of the bishop. In reality, what happened was that the doctrines grew uncontrollably and were never transferred to any secular parish; they formed around the place where the friars had their monastery and from there, they would go out to preach to settlements that belong to the doctrine and were called &quot;annexes&quot;, &quot;visits&quot; or &quot;visit towns&quot;. Therefore, the doctrines had three main characteristics:
* they were independent from external controls (both ecclesiastical and secular)
* were run by a group of friars
* had a relatively larger number of annexes

The main characteristic of the doctrines was that they were run by a group of friars, because it made sure that the community system would continue without any issue when one of the members died.

In 1638, the Order of Preachers split their large doctrines — which meant large economic benefits for them — in groups centered around each one of their six monasteries, including the Sacapulas monastery:

In 1754, the Order of Preachers had to transfer all of their doctrines and convents to the secular clergy, as part of the Bourbon reforms.

===Pan American highway===

In the 20th century, the Pan-American Highway passed Santa Cruz by, making it less a gateway to the Western Highlands and only the main stop on the road to the North of el Quiché. As the living conditions for the Indigenous people were so pitiful in the city, the town of Santo Tomás Chichicastenango, about 20 miles to the south of Santa Cruz, began to swell with the immigration of displaced Mayas and soon passed up Santa Cruz in both size and importance.

=== Guatemalan Civil War ===
During the Guatemalan Civil War Santa Cruz del Quiché found itself in the area where the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres - one of the guerrilla organizations that operated in Guatemala - was active. This organization justified its terrorist attacks against private and public infrastructure by saying that they only impacted the economic interests of both the state and the country&#x27;s productive sector, and that it made the Guatemalan Army more vulnerable. In the Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico final report, former EGP members said that &quot;destroying infrastructure just under the concept of destroying the country&#x27;s infrastructure, to damage the country, that did not happen. There was always an explanation... in context with the war that we were sustaining at the time and in context within the tactic moment when we were going to blow up a bridge, yes, we were going to blow it up so that the Army could not go through and to stop it from its barbarism... to cut its advances and withdraws- But from Nentón to the North, the highway was closed [end of 1981 to beginning of 1982], the Army did not get in, not a single authority would come in, and the telegraph posts -which were the other communication device that existed- were taken down&quot;. &quot;When we cut power to some (Army) barracks the power to the closest towns and village was cut as well, creating resentment in the population. Afterwards, the sabotages were commonplace in order to create chaos along the country and preparing the conditions of a pre insurrection state&quot;.

The EGP attacks that affected Santa Cruz del Quiché were:

In order to counterattack the guerrilla offensive after the victory of the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua in 1979, general Lucas García&#x27;s government began a &quot;Scorched earth&quot; offensive of its own in the area controlled by the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres, -Chajul, Nebaj and Ixcán in Quiché Department-i.e., agricultural and oil-reach region of the Northern Transversal strip-; as part of this offensive, there were intense attacks on civil communities with resulted in massacres that were duly recorded in both the REHMI and Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico final reports.

The Army Base outside the city of Santa Cruz del Quiché was a major staging point for military control of the lands to the north, which were presumed under guerrilla control as they had been a hotbed for both the CUC, the campesino union, and liberation theology. Many of the Vietnam-era tactics used during the intense fighting from 1977 to 1984 were launched from there, including the control of the Ixil Triangle, the settlements of &quot;model villages&quot; outside of Nebaj and other major violence.

In several cases, massacres occurred either at a special day for a community or during large scale operatives with large military force displays and aviation backup. The airplanes bombed certain zones; at least one of each nine communities suffered a bombing associated to a massacre, either in the previous or following days. The areas more heavily bombed were the Ixil triangle and Sacapulas, some parts of Baja Verapaz Department and also from Huehuetenango Department. After an attack of this kind it was common that up to 40% of the surviving population left town to survive, going into the mountains, into exile in Mexico or to another community. The maya k&#x27;iche&#x27; population that looked for refuge in the mountains was labeled as &quot;guerrilla&quot; by the Army, which tighten military controls around them and continuous attacks that made it extremely hard to get food or medical attention. These people remained in the mountains for almost two years until they finally moved to Las Guacamayas, where they became isolated due to the military pressure. A lot of people died of starvation.

<text>Nicholas David Dinsmore (born December 17, 1975), better known by his ring name Eugene, is an American professional wrestler.

Dinsmore&#x27;s career began in 1996 in Ohio Valley Wrestling, where he became the OVW Heavyweight Champion a record eight times as well as the OVW Southern Tag Team Champion eleven times.

He is best known for his time in WWE from 2004 to 2007 under the ring name Eugene, where he portrayed an intellectually disabled wrestling savant. During his time in the company, he was involved in various storylines and competed against such wrestlers like Triple H and Kurt Angle. He also won the World Tag Team Championship with William Regal.

Upon Dinsmore&#x27;s release in 2007, he returned to OVW, where he won the Heavyweight Championships two more times. He made a brief return to WWE in 2013, but he was released the next year. In 2015, he opened his own promotion, Midwest All Pro Wrestling.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Early years (1996–2003) ===
Dinsmore debuted in 1996, and soon began wrestling in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA).

In Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), he formed a successful tag team with Rob Conway, called The Lords of The Ring. The team had a record ten reigns as Southern Tag Team Champions. Dinsmore also held the OVW Heavyweight Championship a record ten times. While still in OVW, Dinsmore also made some appearances as a jobber in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), first on an episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; in 1999. He wrestled in the WWF as Doink the Clown on two later occasions, and as one half of Los Conquistadores (with Rob Conway).

Dinsmore also appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from August 1998 to January 1999, mainly used as a jobber on &quot;Saturday Night&quot; he also worked on two episodes of &quot;Thunder&quot; (losing to Ernest Miller and Kanyon), and on two episodes of &quot;Nitro&quot; (first teaming with Lenny Lane to lose a handicap match to Scott Steiner, then losing a singles match to Wrath).

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2007)===
====Teaming with William Regal (2004–2005)====
On the April 5, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Dinsmore made his World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) debut as Eugene. WWE wrote Eugene as the &quot;special&quot; and overly excited nephew of Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, who had savant-like wrestling ability from watching his favorites on television, Dinsmore has described his portrayal of Eugene as being inspired by Rip Rogers&#x27; autistic child and Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Rain Man&quot;. Bischoff soon placed him under the care of the newly returned William Regal. Although Regal was originally dispirited at having to manage Eugene, he would grow fond of him and the two would quickly become firm friends. In May, Eugene began a feud with Jonathan Coachman, who attempted to banish him from WWE (only to be stopped by The Rock). The feud culminated in Eugene&#x27;s pay-per-view debut, when he defeated Coachman at Bad Blood on June 13. Eugene then feuded with Triple H, which led to a match between the two at SummerSlam on August 15, which Eugene lost. Two weeks later on the August 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, they fought a no disqualification match, which Eugene won after interference from Randy Orton. The next week, they had a steel cage match, which Eugene lost and suffered a kayfabe dislocated shoulder, ending the feud.

After taking a few weeks off to sell his injuries, he feuded with his uncle, Eric Bischoff. This led to a match at the first-ever Taboo Tuesday pay-per-view on October 19. The fan-chosen (via voting at WWE&#x27;s website) stipulation for the match was that the loser would have his head shaved. Eugene won this match (with help from Mr. McMahon) and subsequently shaved Bischoff&#x27;s head.

With Regal, Eugene won his first and only championship in WWE, taking the World Tag Team Championship from La Résistance on the November 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Eugene suffered an injury at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005, in a match with Christian and Tyson Tomko, after botching a dropkick. Although they won the match, he suffered a ruptured left patellar ligament, which required surgery and sidelined him for six months. This also cost him the World Tag Team Championship, which Regal lost to La Résistance when forced to defend at a house show on January 16, teamed with Jonathan Coachman as a substitute. During recovery, Eugene made a surprise appearance at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, delivering a promo until being interrupted and attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. He would be saved by returning Hulk Hogan, after he attacked the villainous duo.

====Singles competition (2005–2006)====
Eugene returned to wrestling on the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, taking part in Kurt Angle&#x27;s regular &quot;Kurt Angle Invitational&quot; challenge. Eugene defeated Angle, winning his cherished Olympic gold medal (per match stipulation), and starting a feud between the two. The feud culminated at SummerSlam on August 21, where Angle defeated Eugene to regain his medal. Eugene then briefly teamed with Tajiri (who, incidentally, had also previously teamed with William Regal). The team lasted until Tajiri&#x27;s release in December.

At Taboo Tuesday on November 1, Rob Conway teamed with Tyson Tomko to face Eugene and a &quot;WWE Legend&quot;, to be chosen by the fans. &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka was chosen over Kamala and &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan, and pinned Conway with his Superfly Splash to win the match.

On November 18, WWE.com reported Dinsmore was rushed to the hospital the previous night, after passing out in a hotel lobby in Manchester, and was suspended indefinitely. Days later, WWE.com stated Dinsmore admitted to taking prescription drugs, including somas. This coincided with the announcement of WWE&#x27;s new drug policy (established as a result of Eddie Guerrero&#x27;s death from heart failure, aggravated by his history of drug abuse).

Eugene made his return to WWE in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2006, as the eighteenth entrant. He was eliminated by Chris Benoit. At WrestleMania 22, Eugene competed in a preshow battle royal which was won by Viscera. Eugene briefly feuded with Matt Striker, after appearing in the &quot;Matt Striker&#x27;s Classroom&quot; segment of Backlash on April 30. Striker ultimately defeated Eugene to end the feud. After appearing at ECW One Night Stand on June 11, Eugene formed a tag team with &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan. He challenged Umaga to a match at Vengeance on June 25 and lost, despite having Duggan, Doink the Clown, and Kamala in his corner. He defeated Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a handicap match on the July 10 &quot;Raw&quot;, after interference from D-Generation X (DX). On the September 4 &quot;Raw&quot;, Eugene and Duggan challenged World Tag Team Champions the Spirit Squad for the title, but were unsuccessful. The team split up on the November 6 &quot;Raw&quot;. After losing a rematch to The Spirit Squad, Eugene attacked Duggan, turning heel. However, the angle was soon dropped and, before the end of the year, Eugene became a face again. After this, he wrestled mainly on the &quot;Raw&quot; B-show, &quot;Heat&quot;.

====Brand switches and departure (2007)====

On the March 19, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Eugene was forced into a match with Umaga, as a punishment for accidentally spilling a drink on Vince McMahon. After losing, McMahon shaved Eugene&#x27;s head. Eugene wrestled on the June 2, 2007 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIV&quot;, where he debuted a new &quot;Superman-esque&quot; wrestling attire. He teamed with Kane and Doink The Clown to defeat Kevin Thorn, Viscera, and Umaga.

On June 17, Eugene was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as their final pick of the 2007 Supplemental Draft. On the June 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Eugene debuted for the brand, losing to The Great Khali. The following week, he was tricked into thinking Deuce &#x27;n Domino were helping him win his match against Mark Henry, which led to a quick defeat.

On the July 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Eugene participated in a battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, and was eliminated by Batista and Kane. Eugene made his final WWE appearance on the August 31 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. While shooting T-shirts into the crowd via T-shirt gun, he accidentally shot Mark Henry. Henry retaliated by squeezing him with a bearhug until he passed out. On September 1, 2007, Nick Dinsmore was released from his WWE contract.

===Juggalo Championship Wrestling (2007, 2011–2013)===
Dinsmore debuted in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) in October 2007, as U-Gene. He returned in 2010, at the &quot;Flashlight Wrestling: Legends &amp; Loonies&quot; event, and lost to Breyer Wellington. He became a full-time member of the roster the following year. He had a brief storyline in which he was infatuated with the wrestler Jailbird Man, inadvertently costing Jailbird his matches. U-Gene participated in JCW&#x27;s first internet pay-per-view, Hatchet Attacks, where he defeated Raven. He formed a tag team with Zach Gowen at Up in Smoke, believing that he could be Gowen&#x27;s second leg, but ended up costing his team the match by distracting the referee. On July 28, Gowen and U-Gene defeated the Ring Rydas to win the JCW Tag Team Championship. However, Gowen forfeited the championship after realizing that U-Gene cheated to win, causing U-Gene to attack him and disband the team. U-Gene defeated Gowen at Bloodymania 5, but the referee reversed the decision after realizing U-Gene cheated to win.

===Independent circuit (2007–2013)===

In October 2007, Dinsmore became the head official in charge of Derby City Wrestling, the intermediate-level group affiliated with Ohio Valley Wrestling, after Joey Matthews left the position. He made some appearances in Puerto Rico&#x27;s World Wrestling Council (WWC), as Eugene. Dinsmore wrestled for WFX Wrestling in Canada, in a role similar to the one he played in WWE, under the names &quot;U-Gene&quot; and &quot;U-gene Dinsmore&quot;. He formed a tag team with Luke Williams, better known as one half of The Bushwhackers. He wrestled for Ring of Honor (as Nick Dinsmore) in a &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; taping, against &quot;The Prodigy&quot; Mike Bennett. In 2009, he was part of Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Australian tour, , where he wrestled as U-Gene.

Dinsmore made his Ring of Honor debut on December 9, 2010, at ROH Wrestling tapings, losing to Mike Bennett. In December 2011, Dinsmore took part in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s (TNA) India project, Ring Ka King as Dr. Nicholas Dinsmore. On July 27, Dinsmore, as &quot;U-Gene&quot;, unsuccessfully challenged Freight Train for the 5 Dollar Wrestling championship in the main event of that promotion&#x27;s internet PPV debut.

===Return to OVW (2008–2013)===
On February 20, 2008, Dinsmore returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) under his real name and defeated Jay Bradley to win his ninth Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Anthony Barvado on July 25, 2008. On October 26, 2011, Dinsmore defeated Jason Wayne to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship for the tenth time, turning heel in the process. Dinsmore lost the title to Rudy Switchblade seven days later in an Eight Man Melee, including Wayne, Adam Revolver, Ted McNaler, James Thomas, Rocco Bellagio and Mike Mondo.

===Returns to WWE (2009, 2013–2014)===
In July 2009, Dinsmore signed a contract to return to WWE. On August 1, Dinsmore (as Eugene) defeated Ricky Ortiz at a SmackDown/ECW house show in Manchester, New Hampshire. On the August 10 &quot;Raw&quot;, Eugene returned to television, losing a Contract on a Pole match to The Calgary Kid, who afterwards removed his mask to reveal himself as The Miz. Four days later, Dinsmore was once again released from WWE, as a wrestler and a trainer.

Dinsmore was re-hired by WWE on September 20, 2013, as trainer on NXT, and he lasted a year before he was released on October 2, 2014.

===Return to the independent circuit (2015–present)===
On January 10, 2015, Dinsmore returned to wrestling, this time with the British promotion International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. He defeated Grado in his first match for the promotion. Dinsmore began running his own shows in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, under the banner of Midwest All Pro Wrestling. The first live event was held November 7, 2015. He sold Midwest All Pro Wrestling at the end of 2021.

==Professional wrestling style, persona and reception==
During his run with WWE, Dinsmore&#x27;s character was &quot;Eugene&quot;, an overly-excited and &quot;special&quot; person who could outwrestle anyone in the ring, based upon some people with intellectual disability. The idea of the gimmick came from then OVW trainer Rip Rogers, who was inspired by his autistic son.

==Personal life==
In 2009, Dinsmore became engaged to Stephanie Fischer, whom he married in November 2015.

<text>Alfred Alvarez (5 August 1929 – 23 September 2019) was an English poet, novelist, essayist and critic who published under the name A. Alvarez and Al Alvarez.

==Background==
Alfred Alvarez was born in London, to an Ashkenazic Jewish mother and a father from a Sephardic Jewish family. He was educated at The Hall School in Hampstead, London, and then Oundle School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he took a First in English. He was subsequently elected as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow at Princeton University. After teaching briefly in Oxford and the United States, he became a full-time writer in his late twenties. From 1956 to 1966, he was the poetry editor and critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;, where he introduced British readers to John Berryman, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Zbigniew Herbert, and Miroslav Holub.

Alvarez was the author of many non-fiction books. His renowned study of suicide, &quot;The Savage God&quot;, gained added resonance from his friendship with Plath. He also wrote on divorce (&quot;Life After Marriage&quot;), dreams (&quot;Night&quot;), and the oil industry (&quot;Offshore&quot;), as well as his hobbies of poker (&quot;The Biggest Game In Town&quot;) and mountaineering (&quot;Feeding the Rat,&quot; a profile of his frequent climbing partner Mo Anthoine). His 1999 autobiography is entitled &quot;Where Did It All Go Right?&quot;

His 1962 poetry anthology &quot;The New Poetry&quot; was hailed at the time as a fresh departure. It championed the American style, in relation to the perceived excessive &#x27;gentility&#x27; of British poetry of the time. In 2010, he was awarded the Benson Medal by the Royal Society of Literature.

==Film and TV==
In July 1989 Alvarez made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot; to discuss gambling alongside, among others, Victor Lownes and David Berglas. Alvarez was portrayed by Jared Harris in the 2003 film &quot;Sylvia&quot;, which chronicles the troubled relationship between Plath and her husband Ted Hughes.

==Death==
He died at the age of 90 from viral pneumonia.

== Legacy ==
In 1990 the British Library acquired Alvarez&#x27;s archive consisting of correspondence, and papers relating to his poetry, prose publications and scripts for stage, film, radio and television.

<doc id="721046" wikidata="Q2975783" url="?curid=721046" title="Naropa University">
<text>Naropa University is a private university in Boulder, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1974 by Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa, it is named after the 11th-century Indian Buddhist sage Naropa, an abbot of Nalanda. The university describes itself as Buddhist-inspired, ecumenical, and nonsectarian rather than Buddhist. Naropa promotes non-traditional activities like meditation to supplement traditional learning approaches.

Naropa was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1988, making it the first Buddhist-inspired academic institution to receive United States regional accreditation. It remains one of only a handful of such schools. The university has hosted a number of Beat poets under the auspices of its Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics.

== History ==
Naropa University was founded by Chögyam Trungpa, an exiled Tibetan tulku who was a Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineage holder. Trungpa entered the USA in 1970, established the Vajradhatu organization in 1973, and then in 1974, established Naropa Institute under the Nalanda Foundation. Initially, the Nalanda Foundation and Vajradhatu were closely linked, having nearly identical boards of directors. In subsequent years they differentiated into more independent institutions.

Trungpa asked poets Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, and Diane di Prima, and the composer John Cage to found a poetics department at Naropa during the first summer session. Ginsberg and Waldman, who roomed together that first summer, came up with the name for the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics.

Naropa&#x27;s first formal degree programs were offered in 1975–76. These included a BA in Buddhist studies and visual art, MA in psychology, MFA in visual art, and expressive arts certificates in dance, theater, and poetics.

The MA in psychology was originally designed as an extension of Trungpa&#x27;s Maitri program, a 16-week meditation course held in Connecticut, and based on Vajrayana teachings on esoteric energy patterns within the mind and body. Trungpa asked Marvin Casper to restructure the Maitri program for use at Naropa as a full-fledged graduate degree program in contemplative psychotherapy. Casper went on to chair that department and edit two of Trungpa’s books. Initially for the degree, students were required to attend three of the institute’s summer sessions, take two Maitri programs in Connecticut, and complete a six-month independent project.
In 1977, at Trungpa&#x27;s urging, Naropa&#x27;s administration made the decision to seek regional accreditation. Evaluation visits continued through 1986, and in 1988, Naropa Institute received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In the mid-1980s, Naropa&#x27;s president, Barbara Dilley, asked Lucien Wulsin to chair the board of directors. One of Wulsin&#x27;s first acts was to formally separate Naropa from Vajradhatu. Ties with Vajradhatu were further weakened with the physical relocation of Vajradhatu&#x27;s main center to Halifax, and then by Trungpa&#x27;s death in 1987.

In 1991 Naropa&#x27;s board of trustees hired John Cobb, a Harvard-educated lawyer and practicing Buddhist, as president. Thomas B. Coburn served in this role from 2003 to 2009, succeeded by Stuart C. Lord in July 2009.

The university began engaging in electrophysiology research at The Graduate School of Counseling and Psychology when the university introduced new equipment for the study of heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, and respiration during 2012 - 2014. Later, Jordan Quaglia, PhD established the Cognitive and Affective Sciences Laboratory to study Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brainwave patterns in 2016 - 2017.

In August 2024 Naropa announced it was selling its main &quot;Arapahoe&quot; campus (2130 Arapahoe Ave). The &quot;Nalanda&quot; campus (6287 Arapahoe Ave) will be retained. The announcement said &quot;With over 40% of students (and a significant portion of staff and faculty) now operating primarily in hybrid and virtual spaces, we are redefining the very essence of what it means to be a community.&quot;

==Spiritual principles==
Naropa promotes contemplative education – a term used primarily by teachers associated with Naropa University or Shambhala Buddhist organizations – including activities such as meditation, the Japanese tea ceremony, taijiquan, Christian labyrinth, ikebana, and neo-pagan ritual. Robert Goss comments that

Geoffrey Samuel, Reginald Ray, and Judith Simmer-Brown have traced the Shambhala lineage [Trungpa&#x27;s teaching] back to the 19th century Rimé movement in Eastern Tibet... When Naropa describes itself as a Buddhist-inspired, nonsectarian liberal arts college, &quot;nonsectarian&quot; translating to the Tibetan &quot;rimed&quot;. Nonsectarian does not, however, mean secular as it is commonly used in higher education. Nonsectarian is perhaps understood as ecumenical openness to contemplative practices and arts of the world religious traditions that foster precision, gentleness, and, spontaneity.

Goss goes on to note that as with many U.S. Protestant and Catholic colleges and universities, Naropa has faced pressure to establish independence from its associated religious organization, Shambhala International; but unlike many such institutions, it has avoided relegating religion to the periphery of university life.

Naropa&#x27;s description of contemplative education makes liberal use of Buddhist language and concepts. For example, its catalogue speaks of &quot;students wholeheartedly engag[ing] in mindfulness awareness practices in order to cultivate being present in the moment...the development of openness, self-awareness, and insight&quot;, and frames &quot;interior work&quot; as &quot;preparation for compassionate and transformative work in the world.&quot;

<text>The Nez Perce War was an armed conflict in 1877 in the Western United States that pitted several bands of the Nez Perce tribe of Native Americans and their allies, a small band of the &quot;Palouse&quot; tribe led by Red Echo (&quot;Hahtalekin&quot;) and Bald Head (&quot;Husishusis Kute&quot;), against the United States Army. Fought between June and October, the conflict stemmed from the refusal of several bands of the Nez Perce, dubbed &quot;non-treaty Indians,&quot; to give up their ancestral lands in the Pacific Northwest and move to an Indian reservation in Idaho Territory. This forced removal was in violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla, which granted the tribe 7.5 million acres of their ancestral lands and the right to hunt and fish on lands ceded to the U.S. government.

After the first armed engagements in June, the Nez Perce embarked on an arduous trek north initially to seek help with the Crow tribe. After the Crows&#x27; refusal of aid, they sought sanctuary with the Lakota led by Sitting Bull, who had fled to Canada in May 1877 to avoid capture following the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn.

The Nez Perce were pursued by elements of the U.S. Army with whom they fought a series of battles and skirmishes on a fighting retreat of . The war ended after a final five-day battle fought alongside Snake Creek at the base of Montana&#x27;s Bears Paw Mountains only from the Canada–US border. A large majority of the surviving Nez Perce represented by Chief Joseph of the &quot;Wallowa&quot; band of Nez Perce, surrendered to Brigadier Generals Oliver Otis Howard and Nelson A. Miles. White Bird, of the &quot;Lamátta&quot; band of Nez Perce, managed to elude the Army after the battle and escape with an undetermined number of his band to Sitting Bull&#x27;s camp in Canada. The 418 Nez Perce who surrendered, including women and children, were taken prisoner and sent by train to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Although Chief Joseph is the most well known of the Nez Perce leaders, he was not the sole overall leader. The Nez Perce were led by a coalition of several leaders from the different bands who comprised the &quot;non-treaty&quot; Nez Perce, including the Wallowa Ollokot, White Bird of the &quot;Lamátta&quot; band, Toohoolhoolzote of the &quot;Pikunin&quot; band, and Looking Glass of the &quot;Alpowai&quot; band. Brigadier General Howard was head of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Department of the Columbia, which was tasked with forcing the Nez Perce onto the reservation and whose jurisdiction was extended by General William Tecumseh Sherman to allow Howard&#x27;s pursuit. It was at the final surrender of the Nez Perce when Chief Joseph gave his famous &quot;I Will Fight No More Forever&quot; speech, which was translated by the interpreter Arthur Chapman.

An 1877 &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial discussing the conflict stated, &quot;On our part, the war was in its origin and motive nothing short of a gigantic blunder and a crime&quot;.

==Background==
In 1855, at the Walla Walla Council, the Nez Perce were coerced by the federal government into giving up their ancestral lands and moving to the Umatilla Reservation in Oregon Territory with the Walla Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla tribes. The tribes involved were so bitterly opposed to the terms of the plan that Isaac I. Stevens, governor and superintendent of Indian affairs for the Washington Territory, and Joel Palmer, superintendent of Indian affairs for Oregon Territory, signed the Nez Perce Treaty in 1855, which granted the Nez Perce the right to remain in a large portion of their own lands in Idaho, Washington, and Oregon territories, in exchange for relinquishing almost 5.5 million acres of their approximately 13 million acre homeland to the U.S. government for a nominal sum, with the that they be able to hunt, fish. and pasture their horses etc. on unoccupied areas of their former land – the same rights to use public lands as Anglo-American citizens of the territories.

The newly established Nez Perce Indian reservation was in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington territories. Under the terms of the treaty, no white settlers were allowed on the reservation without the permission of the Nez Perce. However, in 1860 gold was discovered near present-day Pierce, Idaho, and 5,000 gold-seekers rushed onto the reservation, illegally founding the downstream city of Lewiston as a supply depot on Nez Perce land. Ranchers and farmers followed the miners, and the U.S. government failed to keep settlers out of Indian lands. The Nez Perce were incensed at the failure of the U.S. government to uphold the treaties, and at settlers who squatted on their land and plowed up their camas prairies, which they depended on for subsistence.

In 1863, a group of Nez Perce were coerced into signing away 90% of their reservation to the U.S., leaving only in Idaho Territory. Under the terms of the treaty, all Nez Perce were to move onto the new and much smaller reservation east of Lewiston. A large number of Nez Perce, however, did not accept the validity of the treaty, refused to move to the reservation, and remained on their traditional lands. The Nez Perce who approved the treaty were mostly Christian; the opponents mostly followed the traditional religion. The &quot;non-treaty&quot; Nez Perce included the band of Chief Joseph, who lived in the Wallowa valley in northeastern Oregon. Disputes there with white farmers and ranchers led to the murders of several Nez Perce, and the murderers were never prosecuted.

Tensions between Nez Perce and white settlers rose in 1876 and 1877. General Oliver Otis Howard called a council in May 1877 and ordered the non-treaty bands to move to the reservation, setting an impossible deadline of 30 days. Howard humiliated the Nez Perce by jailing their old leader, Toohoolhoolzote, who spoke against moving to the reservation. The other Nez Perce leaders, including Chief Joseph, considered military resistance to be futile; they agreed to the move and reported as ordered to Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory. By June 14, 1877, about 600 Nez Perce from Joseph&#x27;s and White Bird&#x27;s bands had gathered on the Camas Prairie, six miles (10 km) west of present-day Grangeville.

On June 13, shortly before the deadline for removing onto the reservation, White Bird&#x27;s band held a tel-lik-leen ceremony at the Tolo Lake camp in which the warriors paraded on horseback in a circular movement around the village while individually boasting of their battle prowess and war deeds. According to Nez Perce accounts, an aged warrior named Hahkauts Ilpilp (Red Grizzly Bear) challenged the presence in the ceremony of several young participants whose relatives&#x27; deaths at the hands of whites had gone unavenged. One named Wahlitits (Shore Crossing) was the son of Eagle Robe, who had been shot to death by Lawrence Ott three years earlier. Thus humiliated and apparently fortified with liquor, Shore Crossing and two of his cousins, Sarpsisilpilp (Red Moccasin Top) and Wetyemtmas Wahyakt (Swan Necklace), set out for the Salmon River settlements on a mission of revenge. On the following evening, June 14, 1877, Swan Necklace returned to the lake to announce that the trio had killed four white men and wounded another man. Inspired by the war furor, approximately sixteen more young men rode off to join Shore Crossing in raiding the settlements.

Joseph and his brother Ollokot were away from the camp during the raids on June 14 and 15. When they arrived at the camp the next day, most of the Nez Perce had departed for a campsite on White Bird Creek to await the response of General Howard. Joseph considered an appeal for peace to the Whites, but realized it would be useless after the raids. Meanwhile, Howard mobilized his military force and sent out 130 men, including 13 friendly Nez Perce scouts, under the command of Captain David Perry to punish the Nez Perce and force them onto the reservation. Howard anticipated that his soldiers &quot;will make short work of it.&quot; The Nez Perce defeated Perry at the Battle of White Bird Canyon and began their long flight eastward to escape from the U.S. soldiers.
==War==
Joseph and White Bird were joined by Looking Glass&#x27;s band and, after several battles and skirmishes in Idaho during the next month, approximately 250 Nez Perce warriors, and 500 women and children, along with more than 2000 head of horses and other livestock, began a remarkable fighting retreat. They crossed from Idaho over Lolo Pass into Montana Territory, traveling southeast, dipping into Yellowstone National Park and then back north into Montana, roughly . They attempted to seek refuge with the Crow Nation, but, rejected by the Crow, ultimately decided to try to reach safety in Canada.

A small number of Nez Perce fighters, probably fewer than 200, defeated or held off larger forces of the U.S. Army in several battles. The most notable was the two-day Battle of the Big Hole in southwestern Montana territory, a battle with heavy casualties on both sides, including many women and children on the Nez Perce side. Until the Big Hole the Nez Perce had the naive view that they could end the war with the U.S. on terms favorable, or at least acceptable, to themselves. Afterwards, the war &quot;increased in ferocity and tempo. From then on all white men were bound to be their enemies and yet their own fighting power had been severely reduced.&quot;

The war came to an end when the Nez Perce stopped to make camp and rest on the prairie adjacent to Snake Creek in the foothills of the north slope of the Bear&#x27;s Paw Mountains in Montana Territory, only from the Canada–United States border.

They believed that they had shaken off Howard and their pursuers, but they were unaware that the recently promoted Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles in command of the newly created District of the Yellowstone had been dispatched from the Tongue River Cantonment to find and intercept them. Miles led a combined force made up of units of the Fifth Infantry, and Second Cavalry and the Seventh Cavalry. Accompanying the troops were Lakota and Cheyenne Indian Scouts, many of whom had fought against the Army only a year prior during the Sioux War.

They made a surprise attack upon the Nez Perce camp on the morning of September 30. After a three-day standoff, Howard arrived with his command, on October 3 and the stalemate was broken. Chief Joseph surrendered on October 5, 1877, and declared in his famous surrender speech that he would &quot;fight no more forever.&quot;

In total, the Nez Perce engaged 2,000 American soldiers of different military units, as well as their Indian auxiliaries. They fought &quot;eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes.&quot; Many people praised the Nez Perce for their exemplary conduct and skilled fighting ability. The Montana newspaper &quot;New North-West&quot; stated: &quot;Their warfare since they entered Montana has been almost universally marked so far by the highest characteristics recognized by civilized nations. &quot;

==Surrender==
By the time Chief Joseph formally surrendered on October 5, 1877, 2:20 pm, European Americans described him as the principal chief of the Nez Perce and the strategist behind the Nez Perce&#x27;s skilled fighting retreat. The American press referred to him as &quot;the Red Napoleon&quot; for the military prowess attributed to him, but the Nez Perce bands involved in the war did not consider him a war chief. Joseph&#x27;s younger brother, Ollokot; Poker Joe, and Looking Glass of the Alpowai band were among those who formulated the fighting strategy and tactics and led the warriors in battle, while Joseph was responsible for guarding the camp.

Chief Joseph became immortalized by his famous speech:

&quot;I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Toohoolhoolzoote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say, &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot; He who led the young men [Ollokot] is dead. It is cold, and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are – perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children and see how many of them I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs! I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever.&quot;

Joseph&#x27;s speech was translated by the interpreter Arthur Chapman and was transcribed by Howard&#x27;s aide-de-camp Lieutenant C. E. S. Wood. Among other vocations, Wood was a writer and a poet. His poem, &quot;The Poet in the Desert&quot; (1915), was a literary success, and some critics have suggested that he may have taken poetic license and embellished Joseph&#x27;s speech.

==Aftermath==

During the surrender negotiations, Howard and Miles had promised Joseph that the Nez Perce would be allowed to return to their reservation in Idaho. But, the commanding general of the Army, William Tecumseh Sherman, overruled them and directed that the Nez Perce were sent to Kansas. &quot;I believed General Miles, or I never would have surrendered,&quot; Chief Joseph said afterward.

Miles marched his captives to the Tongue River Cantonment in southeast Montana Territory, where they arrived on October 23, 1877, and were held until Oct. 31. The able-bodied warriors were marched out to Fort Buford, at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. On November 1, women, children, the ill and the wounded set out for Fort Buford in fourteen Mackinaw boats.

Between November 8 and 10, the Nez Perce left Fort Buford for Custer&#x27;s post command at the time of his death; Fort Abraham Lincoln across the Missouri River from Bismarck in the Dakota Territory. About two hundred left in the mackinaws on November 9 guarded by two companies of the First Infantry; the rest traveled on horseback escorted by troops of the Seventh Cavalry en route to their winter quarters.

A majority of Bismarck&#x27;s citizens turned out to welcome the Nez Perce prisoners, providing a lavish buffet for them and their troop escort. On November 23, the Nez Perce prisoners had their lodges and equipment loaded into freight cars and themselves into eleven rail coaches for the trip via train to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.

Over the protests to Sherman by the commander of the Fort, the Nez Perce were forced to live in a swampy bottomland. One author described the effects on the Nez Perce refugees: &quot;the 400 miserable, helpless, emaciated specimens of humanity, subjected for months to the malarial atmosphere of the river bottom.&quot;

Chief Joseph went to Washington in January 1879 to plead that his people be allowed to return to Idaho or, at least, be given land in Indian Territory, what would become Oklahoma. He met with the President and Congress, and his account was published in the North American Review. While he was greeted with acclaim, the U.S. government did not grant his petition due to fierce opposition in Idaho. Instead, Joseph and the Nez Perce were sent to Oklahoma and eventually located on a small reservation near Tonkawa, Oklahoma. Conditions in &quot;the hot country&quot; were hardly better than they had been at Leavenworth.

In 1885, Joseph and 268 surviving Nez Perce were finally allowed to return to the Pacific Northwest. Joseph, however, was not permitted to return to the Nez Perce reservation but instead settled at the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington. He died there in 1904.
==Depictions in media==

===Books===

General Oliver Otis Howard was the commanding officer of U.S. troops pursuing the Nez Perce during the Nez Perce War of 1877. In 1881, he published an account of Joseph and the war, &quot;Nez Perce Joseph: An Account of His Ancestors, His Lands, His Confederates, His Enemies, His Murders, His War, His Pursuit and Capture&quot;, depicting the Nez Perce campaign.

The Nez Perce perspective was represented by &quot;Yellow Wolf: His Own Story&quot;, published in 1944 by Lucullus Virgil McWhorter, who had interviewed Yellow Wolf, a Nez Perce warrior. This book is very critical of the U.S. military&#x27;s role in the war, and especially of General Howard. McWhorter also wrote &quot;Hear Me, My Chiefs!&quot;, published after his death. It was based on documentary sources and had material supporting the historical claims of each side.

The fifth volume of William T. Vollmann&#x27;s &quot;Seven Dreams&quot; cycle, &quot;The Dying Grass&quot;, offers a detailed account of the conflict.

===Television===
The 1975 David Wolper historical teledrama &quot;I Will Fight No More Forever,&quot; starring Ned Romero as Joseph and James Whitmore as General Howard, was well received at a time when Native American issues were receiving wider exposure in the culture. The drama was notable for attempting to present a balanced view of the events: the leadership pressures on Joseph were juxtaposed with the Army&#x27;s having to carry out an unpopular task while an action-hungry press establishment looked on.

===Song===
Folk singer Fred Small&#x27;s 1983 song &quot;The Heart of the Appaloosa&quot; describes the events of the Nez Perce War, highlighting the Nez Perce&#x27;s skillful use of the Appaloosa in battle and in flight. The lyrics identify Chief Joseph&#x27;s Nez Perce name, which translates as &quot;Thunder Rolling Down the Mountain,&quot; and quotes extensively from his &quot;I will fight no more forever&quot; speech.

Texas country band Micky &amp; the Motorcars released the song &quot;From Where the Sun Now Stands&quot; on their 2014 album &quot;Hearts from Above.&quot; The song chronicles the flight of the Nez Perce through Idaho and Montana.

<doc id="721070" wikidata="Q3565541" url="?curid=721070" title="Wallowa River">
<text>The Wallowa River is a tributary of the Grande Ronde River, approximately long, in northeastern Oregon in the United States. It drains a valley on the Columbia Plateau in the northeast corner of the state north of Wallowa Mountains.

The Wallowa Valley was home to Chief Joseph&#x27;s band of the Nez Perce Tribe. Chief Joseph asked the first white settlers to leave when they arrived in 1871. The U.S. government expelled the tribe and seized their property and livestock in 1877, when non-Indian farmers and ranchers wanted to settle the fertile Wallowa valley. The tribe was barred from returning to their homeland by the government after repeated petitions. The tribal members were shipped in unheated box cars to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) to be placed in a prisoner-of-war camp never to see their home again.

==Course==
The river begins at the confluence of its east and west forks, which rise in southern Wallowa County, in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest. It flows generally northwest through the Wallowa Valley, parallel to the McCully Basin which is East of the ridge formed from East Peak, Hidden Peak and Aneroid Mountain. At this point, the West Fork of the Wallowa River drainage basin is connected to the North Fork of the Imnaha River by the Polaris Pass drainage divide.

It then flows past the communities of Joseph, Enterprise, and Wallowa. Further upstream it receives the Minam River from the left at the hamlet of Minam. Continuing north another , it joins the Grande Ronde along the Wallowa–Union county line about north-northeast of Elgin and about from the larger river&#x27;s confluence with the Snake River.

==Fish==
The Wallowa River supports populations of steelhead, spring Chinook salmon, and mountain whitefish among other species. Sockeye salmon were extirpated from the Wallowa River when a small dam was constructed at the outlet of Wallowa Lake in the headwaters of the river. The dam was constructed to raise the level of the lake to store water for irrigation.

<doc id="721074" wikidata="Q2743644" url="?curid=721074" title="Le Canadien">
<text>Le Canadien () was a French language newspaper published at various times in Lower Canada, then the Province of Canada, and finally the province of Quebec, at various times in the 19th century. It went through three different publication phases, with interruptions in publishing.

The paper was dedicated to French-Canadian nationalism, particularly in the first half of the century, during the struggles of the &quot;Canadiens&quot; with the British colonial government. During this period, the paper published articles and commentary on the political issues of the day, and also more general articles on constitutional structure and governance. It was a supporter of the &quot;Parti canadien&quot; in the 1810s and 1820s, which developed into the &quot;Parti patriote&quot; in the 1830s.

Twice, members of the editorial and publishing staff were imprisoned by the British colonial government on grounds of sedition.

The paper&#x27;s final publication was in 1893.

== History ==
===First publication: 1806 to 1810 ===
The newspaper was founded in Quebec City on November 22, 1806 and published until shut down by the colonial government on March 14, 1810. Its masthead motto at this time was &quot;Fiat justitia ruat caelum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Let justice be done though the heavens fall&quot;). It was released every Saturday and the yearly subscription was of 10 chelins or shillings.

The publishers were Pierre-Stanislas Bédard and associates François Blanchet, Jean-Antoine Panet, Jean-Thomas Taschereau and Joseph Le Vasseur Borgia. All were members of the Parliament of Lower Canada at the time. The editor was Jean-Antoine Bouthillier. The newspaper quickly became the voice of the Parti canadien in their battle against the English party and the government of governor James Craig.

On March 17, 1810, the press and the papers of the editorial office on &quot;rue Saint-François&quot; were seized by the government. The printer Charles Lefrançois was imprisoned and a patrol searched the city for conspirators. &quot;The Quebec Mercury&quot; had previously insinuated that the French Canadians and the Americans were plotting against England. Two days later, no conspirators had been found. Bédard, Blanchet and Taschereau were arrested and also jailed.

The prisoners were refused &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. While in prison, Bédard was nominated as member of parliament in the Surrey riding and elected at the general election of March 27, 1810. In 1811, MP Louis-Joseph Papineau asked Governor Craig to clear Bédard of all charges. Governor Craig refused. Bédard was finally ordered out of prison at the end of the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s session. He was never tried.

=== Second publication: 1817 to 1825 ===

In 1817, the paper was revived by François Blanchet as publisher and Flavien Vallerand as editor. The paper continued to support the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;, now coming under the leadership of Louis-Joseph Papineau and John Neilson. The new version of the paper was sometimes referred to as &quot;Le Petit Canadien&quot;, to distinguish it from its major predecessor.

One of the contributing writers was a young student, Augustin-Norbert Morin. When Morin left Quebec to study law in Montreal, his place was taken by Étienne Parent as editor and main writer, from 1822 to 1825. Parent instituted the masthead motto: &quot;Nos institutions, notre langue et nos droits&quot; (&quot;Our institutions, our language, our rights&quot;).

This version of the paper lasted until 1825. A rival paper, &quot;La Gazette de Québec&quot;, became more partisan and attracted the supporters of the &quot;Parti canadien&quot;. Losing its readership, &quot;Le Canadien&quot; folded.

=== Final publication === 
&quot;Le Canadien&quot; disappeared on February 11, 1893, then owned by Joseph-Israël Tarte.

<text>La Línea de la Concepción (), often referred to simply as La Línea, is a municipality of Spain belonging to the province of Cádiz, Andalusia.

The city lies on the sandy isthmus which is part of the eastern flank of the Bay of Gibraltar, and it limits with the Gibraltar–Spain border to the south. La Línea has close economic and social links with the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. It is part of the comarca of Campo de Gibraltar.

The first dwellings, which date back to the 18th century, were behind the Spanish fortification lines drawn up during the Sieges of Gibraltar which took place during the 18c and 19c wars in Europe.

The population of La Línea was a part of the municipality of San Roque until the community was decreed on 17 January 1870 to be a standalone municipality.

The people of La Línea have traditionally found work in Gibraltar, from the days in the 18th century when Gibraltar was an important naval port.

La Linea was, and still is, a supplier of fresh produce from its open and fertile land area as well as its population supplying workers, mainly for the Gibraltar Dockyard.
This provision stopped with the total closure of the border by the Spanish government between 9 June 1969 and 15 December 1982 as a result of the dispute between Spain and Britain regarding the sovereignty of Gibraltar. 
The border was fully reopened on 5 February 1985.

La Línea is a major supplier of fruit and vegetables to Gibraltar; other industries include the manufacture of cork, liquor, and fish paste. It also had an important military garrison with substantial fortifications and a port.

== Name ==
Segregated from the municipality of San Roque in 1870, the municipality of &#x27;La Línea&#x27; () derives its name from the &#x27;Line of Contravallation&#x27; () defence structure built after the 1727 siege on Gibraltar. In 1883, it was first recorded under the official name of &#x27;La Línea de la Concepción&#x27; (a reference to the Immaculate Conception, the then patron of the Spanish Army).

== History ==

=== The War of Spanish Succession and the British occupation of Gibraltar ===

When Charles II died in 1700 without an heir to the Crown of Spain, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out between the two main pretenders to the Spanish throne: Philip of Anjou and Charles, Archduke of Austria (later Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire). 
Philip was the grandson of Louis XIV of France, and had the support of France. Austria, England, and the Netherlands feared a possible alliance and/or a hypothetical union between the French and Spanish royal houses, and so favoured the Habsburg Charles. In November 1700, Philip was declared king.

The Grand Alliance captured Gibraltar on 3 August 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession after abortive attempts elsewhere. It was selected for its strategic value, weak garrison and to encourage the rejection of Philip V (the Bourbon Claimant) in favour of Charles III (the Hapsburg claimant). Following orders to respect civilians, officers tried to maintain control but discipline broke down and the men ran amok. After order was restored, despite the surrender agreement promising property and religious rights, most of the population left with the garrison on 7 August citing loyalty to Philip. Several factors influenced the decision including the expectation of a counter attack and the violence during the capture, which ultimately proved disastrous for the Hapsburg cause. The subsequent siege failed to dislodge the Hapsburg forces and the refugees settled around Algeciras and the hermitage of San Roque. In 1711, the British and French Governments started secret negotiations to end the war leading to the cession of Gibraltar to the British by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The municipality of San Roque still has as its motto &quot;La Muy Noble y Más Leal Ciudad de San Roque, donde reside la de Gibraltar &quot; (&quot;the Most Noble and Most Loyal City of San Roque, where reside those [the people] of Gibraltar&quot;). The town lands included the area of the modern La Línea de la Concepción.

King Felipe V, the name by which Philip of Anjou was crowned, ordered the Marquis de Villadarías to besiege the &quot;Plaza de Gibraltar&quot;. This first attempt to regain the city was unsuccessful and the Spanish army lifted the siege. However, to monitor the isthmus and to oppose a possible invasion of the rest of the territory, a permanent garrison was established in the area, under the military government of Campo de Gibraltar.

=== The Contravallation Line or &quot;La Línea de Gibraltar&quot; ===

Gibraltar was under constant surveillance and subjected to the unsuccessful Siege of Gibraltar 1727 and the Great Siege of Gibraltar 1779-1783. After the 1727 siege, the Spanish government began the construction of a line of fortifications, the &quot;Contravallation Line&quot; or &quot;La Línea de Gibraltar&quot; thus eventually giving rise to the town La Línea De La Concepción. This would isolate the British outpost from the Spanish mainland.

An order was issued on 2 November 1730 to the Director of Engineering Prospero Jorge de Verboom, for the construction of two strongholds, one located to the east and the other at west of the isthmus, both united by a line of fortification, with the aim of preventing the movement and to assert rights over the isthmus, in addition to consolidate the Spanish presence in the area.

Construction began in 1731 on the two major strongholds, known as Santa Bárbara and San Felipe. The first was named in honor of the patroness of the Artillery, located at the east beach, where their remains are still visible. The second took its name to honor King Felipe V, and is situated on the west beach. Between these two strongholds a large wall was built with central square tip diamond shaped bulwarks with their respective bodies, running from Santa Bárbara to San Felipe. All of them were located at equidistant distances and were called Santa Mariana, San Benito, semi-square and body guard of San José, San Fernando and San Carlos.

Construction of this formidable defensive line was completed in 1735; described now as &quot; &#x27;Contravallation Line&quot;&#x27; or &quot;La Línea de Gibraltar&quot;.

Thus, La Línea originated from a provisional camp made by artisans and merchants who supplied the military and their families in the vicinity of the fortifications erected to besiege Gibraltar.

The bastions of The Line of Gibraltar would remain intact serving the purpose for which they were built until 1810 during the invasion of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleonic troops, leading to the Spanish War of Independence and the Peninsular War.

Fearing that the French troops of Napoleon Bonaparte, which had already arrived in the Campo de Gibraltar, might take over the fortresses of La Línea, the Gibraltar Commanding Royal Engineer Charles Holloway decided to blast an opening through them on 14 February 1810. Gibraltar, supported by La Línea, became an important base for Spanish fighters against Napoleon&#x27;s troops.

After the destruction of the physical line that blocked the passage through the isthmus, the city continued to grow with a strong dependence on Gibraltar, covering all sorts of services to Gibraltar (supply of food, meat, fruit, vegetables and physical space for housing nearby and a labor force in the service of an expanding port, etc.).

In due time, traders, merchants and workers wanted the simple line of buildings to become an independent municipality of San Roque, controlled by the military, landowners and aristocrats. On 17 January 1870 the segregation of La Línea from San Roque was approved.

Some 300 inhabitants were located at Gibraltar Line, the place being named therefore, in Spanish, &quot;La Línea&quot;. The new municipality included the current Plaza de la Iglesia, Plaza de la Constitución, calle Real (&quot;Royal Street&quot;), Jardines Street and España Avenue. It had a cemetery, the command, and a customs post, guards and soldiers barracks being located beyond the neighborhood and Espigón far east on the beach.

Properly speaking, La Atunara or Tunara, should not be considered as a contemporary part of the line because its origins date back to some 640 years before the city itself.

On 20 July 1870 La Línea got its first mayor, Lutgardo López Muñoz, chosen by a committee of residents appointed by the provincial council. At the first meeting of the new city hall, it was unanimously decided the name should be La Línea de la Concepción, as the Immaculate Conception was deeply rooted in Spanish army tradition of the time. The name is recorded from 1883.

La Línea was granted the title of &#x27;city&#x27; () in 1913.

===Relations with modern Gibraltar===
Dictator Francisco Franco ordered the closure of the border gate with Gibraltar on 8 June 1969, in response to the new Gibraltar Constitution. Many people from La Línea lost their jobs in Gibraltar. The border was reopened on 15 December 1982 with full public access in 1985.

Protests were undertaken against the presence of the nuclear submarine HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; in Gibraltar for repairs in 2001.

In 2010, the People&#x27;s Party mayor of La Línea, Alejandro Sánchez, attempted to impose a &quot;congestion charge&quot; on people entering or leaving Gibraltar.

In November 2017, Apymell collective of small businesses started accepting Pound sterling as a currency for payment in the town.

2020 British exit from the EU has rendered Gibraltar foreign territory, but Spain retains the &#x27;status quo&#x27;, pending further negotiations, with a preliminary agreement to avoid a hard border between Gibraltar and Spain,an agreement which in 2023 still continues in negotiation.

The Línea town council has pleaded for the establishment of the town as a new autonomous community of Spain out of Andalusia, with a similar status to that of Ceuta and Melilla. The Supreme Court sentenced that the measure &quot;affects the territorial organization of the State and of the Autonomous Communities, an extremely delicate matter in which any alteration goes beyond purely local interests&quot;, thereby bringing down the initiative.

==Monuments==
=== Strongholds of San Carlos, Santa Bárbara and San Felipe ===
18th century military buildings. Built during the siege of Gibraltar as part of the so-called Contravalación Line of Gibraltar, a group of fortifications whose goal was to besiege Gibraltar checking on any UK further expansionist ideas.

During the War of Independence, Peninsular War, Spain had initially been allied to France while trying to invade Portugal, but France shortly after turned on its ally, Spain. Forcing the Spanish to ally itself with Great Britain and Portugal against Napoleonic France to regain control of Spain from the French, these fortifications were blown up by the British to avoid falling into the hands of France. Currently, the Ruins of Fort St. Barbara is in a recovery phase, while the Fort San Felipe remnants have appeared recently. Fort San Carlos does not seem to have left preserved evidence.
EU funding was provided in 2023 to La Linea to enable a restoration of the Santa Barbara fort.

=== The Military HQ ===
Currently it hosts the Museum of the Isthmus but was once the military command associated to the Halls Head Officers garrison. It is the oldest building in town that exists, whose Officers&#x27; pavilions date from 1863 to 1865.

=== The Municipal Guards Building ===
In 1944 it was demolished in the old &quot;Carabineros Barracks&quot; at the Explanada (now, the Constitution Plaza). There was a single floor building located in the left corner of it. This building was for many years, the Municipal Guards Building and next to it, the first Police Station of this city lasting till about 1936. The Santa Mariana Guard was responsible for checking the San Benito Guard, by the sidewalk near the fountain of Santa Barbara on the beach of Levante.

===Torre Nueva===
The Torre Nueva tower is one of 44 towers of the same characteristics that built along the coast from the river Guadiaro to the border with Portugal. All of them were built during the reign of Felipe III, with others located on the Mediterranean coast, from Málaga to Catalonia. These were built to warn the coastal population to the presence of the Berber pirate ships. Smoke signals and bonfires were used to warn of the presence of the pirate ships. At the top of the building, there was always a bundle of dry wood to be burned immediately in case of danger, transmitting the alarm signal to the towers nearby.
EU funding was provided in 2023 to La Linea to enable a restoration of the Santa Barbara fort.

=== Bullring ===
The Bullring was built on the old Plaza del Arenal and took 3 years to build and was completed in 1883 with capacity for 6000 people. It is considered to be one of the oldest buildings in La Línea along with the former Military Command, now the Museo del Istmo , which are good examples of architecture in Andalusia in the late 19th century. Various fights have taken place in the bullring including a fight between a lion and a bull in 1887. During the 1970s and 1980s the upper part of the bullring was unsafe and was demolished.
The bull-ring is now fully restored and bullfights take place again. It also acts as a venue for music and other events.

Luis Ramírez Galuzo was undoubtedly one of the neighbors of the city with more economic means of the century, and the mayor on several occasions, submitted to the council for permission to build on own property, a bullring, to celebrate the Spanish festival, other festivals such as acrobatic, and other celebrations in the year 1880, the project being led by the provincial architect Adolfo del Castillo, author among other works, of the Abastos market, today Concepción market and the former Municipal Slaughterhouse now disappeared.

Bullfights mark the beginning of the Feria de la Línea which is celebrated in mid-July and in recent times is the only time that a bullfight occurs.

=== Shrine of the Immaculate Conception ===
The main Parish church was built in the 19th century colonial style. Notable features are the 17th-century reredos and the image of St. Mary made by the Andalusian sculptor Luis Ortega Bru. The church became a shrine at the end of 2005. The Church of the Immaculate Conception has three naves. The exterior of the building echoes the interior layout, with a remarkable simplicity and beauty.

Inside the parish church of the Immaculate Conception there are images of &quot;Jesús del Gran Poder&quot;, and others belonging to four religious guilds.

===The Three Graces===
The Three Graces is a Monument at the Plaza de la Iglesia that is based on the Greek mythology of the three Charites, which represent charm, beauty, and creativity. This work by Nacho Falgueras is based on that by the local painter José Cruz Herrera. The recently opened monument is a tribute to the &quot;linense&quot; women.

=== Monument to the Spanish workers in Gibraltar ===
Work also of Nacho Falgueras. It is a tribute to the thousands of &quot;linenses&quot; and &quot;campogibraltareños&quot; who spent their lives working in Gibraltar. Because of difficult times in this part of Spain they crossed the border every day to work and support their families. It is a tribute by the town of La Línea to all those who worked and continue to work in Gibraltar.

=== Monument to Camarón de la Isla ===
Monument located on the west access of the city, between the Paseo Marítimo de Poniente and the Casa de la Juventud. It is a historical monument dedicated to the figure of the famous flamenco singer José Monge Cruz, Camarón de la Isla, who lived much of his life in this city. The sculpture is also the work of Nacho Falgueras.

=== Conservatorio Profesional de Música &quot;Muñoz Molleda&quot; ===
It takes its name from the &quot;linense&quot; José Muñoz Molleda, who gave music lessons to many young people, aged between 9 and 35 years, both &quot;Linenses&quot; and from other nearby cities, as this Music Conservatory was the only one in the Campo de Gibraltar area awarding a &quot;Grado Medio&quot;—intermediate degree.

A stepping stone for learning music in the city for many years, together with the &quot;Linense&quot; Municipal Foundation of Culture and the Félix Enríquez Musical Society, particularly its most recent director Ignacio Ábalos Nuevo.

Currently under reform, there is still teaching going on. On the underground parking just below the extension of the Conservatory, archaeological remains of the 18th century Contravalación line were found and are now displayed nearby.

Plans for introducing soon the area of professional Opera Singing were put forward in December 2006 by famous International Opera soprano Singer Montserrat Caballé.

<doc id="721130" wikidata="Q1062788" url="?curid=721130" title="Grand National Alliance (Guatemala)">
<text>The Grand National Alliance (, GANA) was a right-wing conservative political party in Guatemala. The acronym &quot;GANA&quot; also spells out the word &quot;gana&quot;, from the verb &quot;ganar&quot;, &quot;to win&quot;.

==Formation and 2003 election==
GANA was created as an electoral alliance to fight the 2003 general election. In that election, held on 9 November 2003, the Grand National Alliance, won 24.3% of the vote, and 47 out of 158 seats in Congress. The presidential candidate of the alliance, Óscar Berger Perdomo, won 34.3% at the presidential elections of the same day. He won 54.1% at the second round on 28 December 2003 and was elected president.

The alliance was made up of the following parties:
*Patriotic Party (Partido Patriota) (PP)
*Reform Movement (Movimiento Reformador) (MR)
*National Solidarity Party (Partido Solidaridad Nacional) (PSN)

==Evolution and 2007 election==
The Patriotic Party broke with the alliance in the early months of Óscar Berger&#x27;s administration. In November 2005, the National Solidarity Party ceded its electoral registration to GANA, with which the Grand National Alliance ceased to be an alliance and became a political party. In August 2006, the Reform Movement withdrew its support from GANA. 

GANA&#x27;s candidate in the 2007 presidential election was former director of the national prison service Alejandro Giammattei. He came in third place in the election, with 17% of the vote. Despite the splits in the party, it did relatively well in the congressional elections, receiving 37 seats and becoming the second largest party in Congress.

In 2017 the party was renamed Crecer (&quot;Grow&quot;) and its colours were changed to yellow and green. It was dissolved in September 2018.

<doc id="721148" wikidata="Q1237557" url="?curid=721148" title="National Unity of Hope">
<text>The National Unity of Hope (, UNE) is a populist political party in Guatemala. It was founded in 2002 and defined itself as a social-democratic and social-Christian party, but since transformed and is now described as a right-wing party. It is the largest political party in Guatemala by the number of members.

== Ideology ==
At the time of its founding in 2002, it defined itself as a social-democratic and social-Christian party, but has gradually shifted to the right wing. It opposes lifting abortion and same-sex marriage bans in the country. However, it supports social programs aimed at uplifting the &quot;forgotten&quot; poor of the country.

==2003 election==

At the legislative elections held on November 9, 2003, the party won 17.9% of the popular vote and 32 out of 158 seats in Congress. Its presidential candidate Álvaro Colom won 26.4% in the presidential elections on the same day and was defeated in the second round, when he received 45.9%.

==2007 election==

For the 2007 elections, the party again chose Colom as its presidential candidate. He came in first place with 28% of the vote; 
in the Legislative Election, the party won 22.8% of the vote and 48 seats in Congress, more than any other party. On November 4, 2007, in the second round of the election, Colom was elected President of Guatemala. It would mark the first time since 1954 that Guatemala had a left wing government.

==2011 election==

In the 2011 elections, the Constitutional Court ruled out the candidacy of Colon&#x27;s ex-wife, Sandra Torres, thus making it the first time in the history of the elections that an official ruling party did not present presidential and vice-presidential candidacies; however, the party won 39 seats in Congress.

==2015 election==

In the 2015 elections held on September 6, 2015, the National Unity of Hope won 19.76% of the vote in the first round and 27 seats in Congress. In the second round (run-off) Presidential candidate Sandra Torres placed second in the presidential race with 32.56% of the vote, eventually losing in the October 25 run-off to Jimmy Morales of the National Convergence Front (FCN/Nation).

==2019 election==

In the 2019 elections held on June 16, 2019, the party again chose Sandra Torres as its presidential candidate. She came in first place in the first round with 25.54% of the vote but lost the second round on August 11, 2019 with 42.05% of the vote to Alejandro Giammattei of the Vamos party; in the Legislative Election, the UNE party won 54 seats in Congress, more than any other party.
==2023 election==

The National Unity of Hope had an internal division between deputies opponents and supporters of Sandra Torres in 2020, caused by Torres&#x27;s accusations of corruption and poor electoral results in 2019, as well as her support for the government of Alejandro Giammattei. A faction opposing Torres removed her as leader and expelled her from the party in 2021. However, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal ruled in favor of Torres and allowed her to continue as party leader. A few days after the decision of the electoral court, the opposition group to Sandra Torres announced its resignation from the National Unity of Hope, to found the &quot;Parliamentary Opposition Group&quot;, in reference to its parliamentary opposition to the Giammattei government.

The Parliamentary Opposition Group approached the Will, Opportunity and Solidarity political party.

After Torres&#x27; new electoral defeat, the National Unity of Hope suffered another split in early 2024, when a group of more than 20 members of Congress led by Adim Maldonado (who was Torres&#x27;s right-hand man in the 2023 campaign) and José Inés Castillo agreed to join a legislative agreement with the government of Bernardo Arévalo. Torres tried to expel Maldonado and Castillo but the decision was annulled by the new legislative majority and she lose control of the legislative bench.

In July 2024, José Inés Castillo resumed his alliance with Torres and began to dispute with Adim Maldonado for the leadership of the party in Congress. Maldonado would have between 15 and 16 members of Congress on his side, while Castillo and Torres have between 12 and 13 deputies in their favor. With this, Torres once again consolidated her leadership within the party.

<text>The Quebec Mercury was an English language weekly newspaper published in Quebec City from 1805 to 1863.

The &quot;Mercury&quot; was founded by publisher Thomas Cary in respect and veneration of Canada&#x27;s link to the United Kingdom. From 1828 to 1848 the Mercury was owned jointly by Thomas Cary Jr. and Pierre-Édouard Desbarats. The newspaper generally represented the economic and political interests of the English merchants, while its rival &quot;Le Canadien&quot; (1806–1893) represented the economic and political interests of the French language moneyed groups. The &quot;Quebec Mercury&quot; was deeply conservative, advocated for the assimilation of French Canadians, and sought to Anglicise the colony. Cary perceived the rise of a French middle class and the French majority in the Assembly as a threat to the growth of Anglo-Canadian commercial interests. The newspaper survived until the 1950s.

Together, &quot;Le Canadien&quot; and the &quot;Mercury&quot; were the first truly political newspapers printed in Canada.

<doc id="721160" wikidata="Q116740520" url="?curid=721160" title="Institutional Republican Party">
<text>The Institutional Republican Party (, PRI), until 2013 known as the Guatemalan Republican Front (&quot;Frente Republicano Guatemalteco&quot;, FRG), was a right-wing to far-right political party in Guatemala.

==History==

It was created in 1989 by former president and dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, and formally registered in 1990. It chose Ríos Montt as its candidate, but he was not allowed to stand because of a constitutional ban on former coup leaders such as himself from seeking the presidency. By the time the decision was made to ban him, it was too late for the FRG to choose another candidate. They did win 10 seats in the National Congress in those concurrent elections. It was the main component of the &quot;No Sell-Out Platform,&quot; an alliance of right-wing parties.

In early elections only to the Congress in 1994 the FRG gained 32 seats and became the largest single party in the legislature. In the 1995 presidential election, FRG candidate Alfonso Portillo narrowly lost in the second round, which is a run-off between the two highest placed candidates from the first round ballot. It gained a reduced 21 seats in Congress.

In 1999 Alfonso Portillo won the presidential election, while the FRG, with 63 seats, had a majority in Congress. Ríos Montt became the President of Congress (speaker). Paradoxically they gained their strongest support from the same rural communities that had most suffered under the former rule of Ríos Montt between 1982 and 1983.

For the 2003 presidential elections, the FRG again put forward Ríos Montt as its presidential candidate. Contradictory judicial rulings on whether he would be able to stand motivated a march on Guatemala City by FRG supporters bussed in from all over the country on 24 July, resulting in a chaotic situation known as &quot;Jueves Negro&quot; (&quot;Black Thursday&quot;). Days later the ban on Ríos Montt&#x27;s candidacy was lifted by the Constitutional Court. Opponents claimed that the FRG obtained that ruling by previously appointing its own loyalists to the high court. Meanwhile, Ríos Montt claimed that previous judicial rulings preventing him from running for president were the work of his political opponents.

Despite a vigorously run campaign, the violence of &quot;Jueves Negro&quot;, as well as the numerous corruption scandals of the incumbent Portillo administrations, adversely impacted Ríos Montt&#x27;s popularity and credibility. He was third in first round of voting, with 19.3% of the ballots. In the congressional elections held the same day, 9 November 2003, the FRG won 19.7% of the popular vote and 43 out of 158 seats, dropping to second in the chamber.

Ríos Montt&#x27;s daughter, Zury Ríos, was the party&#x27;s floor leader.

For the 2007 elections, the party chose Luis Rabbe as its presidential candidate. With the large number of right-wing parties running in the election, the FRG was badly defeated in these elections. Rabbe came in fifth place with 7.3% of the vote, and the party received 9% of the vote and 15 seats in the congressional elections.

In January 2013, the FRG was renamed to Institutional Republican Party (PRI). Zury Ríos left the party to become Vision with Values (ViVa)&#x27;s presidential candidate in 2015. Instead, PRI nominated the manager and Congressman Luis Fernando Pérez as its candidate.

===2015 election===

In the legislative elections held on September 6, 2015, the PRI secured 57,948 votes (1.25% of the total) in the race for national-list deputies and, save for defections, will have no representation in the 2016-2020 Congress. In the presidential election held on the same day, its candidate Luis Fernando Pérez received 41,969 votes (0.86%).

Having failed to secure the minimum of 5% of the popular vote or one seat in Congress, the PRI forfeited its official registration as a party. The party was dissolved soon afterwards.

<doc id="721170" wikidata="Q1326375" url="?curid=721170" title="Languages of Timor-Leste">
<text>The languages of Timor-Leste include both Austronesian and Papuan languages. (See Timor–Flores languages and Timor–Alor–Pantar languages.) The lingua franca and national language of Timor-Leste is Tetum, an Austronesian language influenced by Portuguese, with which it has equal status as an official language. The language of the Oecusse exclave is Uab Meto (Dawan). Fataluku is a Papuan language widely used in the eastern part of the country (often more so than Tetum). A dialect of Malay-based creole called Dili Malay is spoken by a number of residents in the capital Dili, it borrowed words mostly from Portuguese and Tetum. Both Portuguese and Tetum have official recognition under the Constitution of Timor-Leste, as do other indigenous languages, including: Bekais, Bunak, Galoli, Habun, Idalaka, Kawaimina, Kemak, Lovaia, Makalero, Makasae, Mambai, Tokodede and Wetarese.

The rise of lingua francas in the linguistically diverse Timor-Leste and the domination of several clans over others have led to the extinction of many smaller languages. However, some of them are still in use as ritual languages or cants. Research done in the mid-2000s by the Dutch linguist Aone van Engelenhoven, for example, revealed that the Makuva language, formerly spoken by the Makuva tribe but believed to have been extinct since the 1950s, was still used occasionally.

In 2007, Van Engelenhoven discovered the existence of another language that was essentially extinct, called Rusenu.

==Official languages==
Section 13(1) of the 2002 constitution designates Portuguese and Tetum as Timor-Leste&#x27;s two official languages. The same section also provides that &quot;Tetum and the other national languages shall be valued and developed by the State.&quot; English and Indonesian are sometimes used and section 159 of the constitution provides that these languages serve as &quot;working languages within civil service side by side with official languages as long as deemed necessary&quot;.

Under Portuguese rule, all education was through the medium of Portuguese, although it coexisted with Tetum and other languages. Portuguese particularly influenced the dialect of Tetum spoken in the capital, Dili, known as &quot;Tetun Prasa&quot;, as opposed to the more traditional version spoken in rural areas, known as &quot;Tetun Terik&quot;. &quot;Tetun Prasa&quot; is the version more widely used, and is now taught in schools.

Under Indonesian rule from 1976 to 1999, East Timor&#x27;s official language was Indonesian; It, along with English, currently has the status of a &#x27;working language&#x27; under the present constitution.

For many older East Timorese, the Indonesian language has negative connotations with the Suharto regime, some parties are also considering as early as after independence in the 2000s to relabel it in the context as a working language to &quot;Malay&quot;. On the other hand, many younger people expressed suspicion or hostility to the reinstatement of Portuguese, which they saw as a &#x27;colonial language&#x27; in much the same way that Indonesians saw Dutch. However, whereas the Dutch culture and language had limited influence on those of Indonesia, the East Timorese and Portuguese cultures became intertwined, particularly through intermarriage, as did the languages. Portuguese was also a working language of the resistance against Indonesia.

Some young East Timorese felt at a disadvantage by the adoption of Portuguese as an official language, and accused the country&#x27;s leaders of favouring the older generations who speak Portuguese and educated Timorese who had only recently returned from overseas, arguing that those older East Timorese who speak Portuguese or English had more job opportunities. 
Many foreign observers, especially from Australia and Southeast Asia were also critical about the reinstatement of Portuguese, arguing that English or Indonesian would have been preferable. In spite of this, many Australian linguists have been closely involved with the official language policy, including the promotion of Portuguese.

Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries such as Brazil have supported the teaching of Portuguese in Timor-Leste. Some people in Timor-Leste complained that teachers from Portugal and Brazil were poorly equipped to teach in the country, as they did not know local languages, or understand the local culture. 
Nevertheless, the late Sérgio Vieira de Mello, who headed the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, was a Brazilian who established a close working relationship with Xanana Gusmão, the country&#x27;s first president, as a fellow Portuguese-speaker but was respected by many East Timorese because of his efforts to learn Tetum.

<text>Jorge Antonio Serrano Elías (born April 26, 1945) is a Guatemalan industrial engineer and politician who served as the 41st president of Guatemala from January 14, 1991 to June 1, 1993.

==Life and career==
Serrano was born on 26 April 1945 in Guatemala City as the son of Jorge Adán Serrano and Rosa Elías, who was of Lebanese descent. After attending Liceo Guatemala he graduated from the University of San Carlos with a degree in industrial engineering. Then, attended Stanford University in California, U.S., where he studied economic growth and gained a doctorate in education and science. He then returned to Guatemala to become a civil servant. In 1976, he collaborated with various American Protestant churches to help the population recover from the devastating earthquake that had afflicted the country. He then published a document describing the wretched conditions under which the indigenous people lived, which resulted in him receiving threats. He went into exile in the U.S., only returning in 1982 to work in the government of fellow evangelical General Efraín Ríos Montt as Vice President of the Advisory Board to the government.

In 1985, Serrano stood as presidential candidate for the &quot;Democratic Party of National Co-operation&quot; (PDCN) and the Revolutionary Party (PR), coming third with 12.6% of the vote. In September 1987, as the political party&#x27;s representative, he became one of the four members of the National Reconciliation Commission (CNR).

==President (1991–1993)==
Serrano became the presidential candidate for the &quot;Solidarity Action Movement&quot; (MAS) in the 1990 presidential elections. He lost the first round on November 11 with 24.1% of the vote but won the second round against Jorge Carpio on January 6, 1991 with 68.1%. Carpio unsuccessfully tried to use Serrano&#x27;s fundamentalist beliefs against him as a campaign issue.

On January 14, Serrano replaced Vinicio Cerezo as President of Guatemala. He was the second non-Catholic to gain power in Guatemala after Ríos Montt. The transfer of power marked the first time in decades that an incumbent president had peacefully surrendered power to an elected opposition victor. As his party gained only 18 of 116 seats in Congress, Serrano entered into a tenuous alliance with the Christian Democrats and Carpio&#x27;s National Union of the Center (UCN).

The Serrano administration&#x27;s record was mixed. It succeeded in consolidating civilian control over the army, replacing several senior officers, and persuading the military to participate in peace talks with the URNG. He took the politically unpopular step of recognizing the sovereignty of Belize. The Serrano administration reversed the economic slide it inherited, reducing inflation and boosting real growth.

On May 25, 1993, Serrano sparked the 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis when he illegally suspended the constitution, dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court, imposed censorship, and tried to restrict civil freedoms, allegedly to fight corruption. The attempted self-coup was similar to the one Peru&#x27;s Alberto Fujimori carried out. However, Serrano&#x27;s action met with strong protests by most elements of Guatemalan society, at the forefront of which was the &quot;Siglo Veintiuno&quot; newspaper under the leadership of José Rubén Zamora. This was combined with international pressure and the army&#x27;s enforcement of the decisions of the Constitutional Court, which ruled against the attempted takeover. In the face of this pressure, Serrano resigned as president on June 1 and fled the country. He was replaced on an interim basis by his vice president, Gustavo Adolfo Espina Salguero. However, Espina was also involved in Serrano&#x27;s self-coup, and Congress replaced him with Human Rights Ombudsman Ramiro de León Carpio.

== Post-presidency ==
Serrano now resides in Panama with his wife, Magda Bianchi de Serrano. He has a set of twin sons, a son named Juan Pablo Serrano, and two daughters. He has three sisters, one of whom is Olga Stella Serrano de Salazar, who resides in Guatemala City with her husband, Rafael Salazar Farfan. The Guatemalan government has made numerous unsuccessful attempts to have him extradited on corruption charges. Jorge Serrano is involved in real estate as a developer and investor in Panama and the U.S. state of Florida.

<doc id="721214" wikidata="Q887617" url="?curid=721214" title="Vinicio Cerezo">
<text>Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo (born December 26, 1942) is a Guatemalan politician who served as the 40th president of Guatemala from 1986 to 1991. He also served as the Secretary General of the Central American Integration System (SICA) from 2017 to 2021.

==Career==
Cerezo was born in Guatemala City, the son of the Supreme Court judge Marco Vinicio Cerezo Sierra, and came from a well-known liberal family. In 1962, he was a member of the student body of the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC), which played an important part in the national protests against the government of Miguel Ydígoras. In 1964, he joined the Guatemalan Christian Democrats (DCG), a political party banned from standing in the 1966 elections. He graduated in judicial science from USAC in 1968, the same year the DCG was formally legalized, and was made its secretary in 1970. With a very tense political situaction, Cerezo was forced to hire permanent protection from that time. In February 1981, in the worst of 3 assassination attempts, his vehicle was attacked with hand grenades and machine gun fire in the center of the capital.

In 1974, the DCG formed part of the coalition that backed General Efraín Ríos Montt for president. Amidst allegations of fraud, Ríos Montt lost to Kjell Eugenio Laugerud. Cerezo was elected a deputy in the National Congress, where the DCG, with 14 seats, became the largest party within the opposition.

In 1978 General, Ricardo Peralta Méndez, the DCG candidate, came second to Fernando Romeo Lucas García. During Lucas García&#x27;s tenure, 150 members of the DCG were murdered. The three surviving members of the Congress and the party were forced into hiding, not because of a ban but in fear for their lives. Yet, Cerezo appeared at the March 1982 elections to support the opposition candidate Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre, who lost out to the official candidate Ángel Aníbal Guevara. Suspecting fraud, Maldonado, Cerezo, and their followers launched a campaign denouncing the result. The result became academic when Efraín Ríos Montt took power in a coup, which the DCG and Cerezo initially supported. When it became clear that the repression in the countryside was becoming more indiscriminate and, perhaps more importantly, that Ríos Montt was fanatically preaching an evangelical, messianic, born-again type of Christianity, Cerezo withdrew his support for the regime and demanded new elections. In 1983, General Óscar Humberto Mejía took power in another coup, which Cerezo cautiously supported. The DCG gained 21.2% of the vote in the 1984 National Congress elections and was the largest party with 20 of the 88 seats. With this success behind them, the DCG decided to postulate Cerezo for the 1985 presidential election. He began to promote the idea of talking to the United Guatemalan National Revolutionaries (URNG), an umbrella group containing the main three guerrilla groups.

==President (1986-1991)==
In the first round of the 1985 presidential elections on 3 November, Cerezo came first with 38.6% of the popular vote. In the second round on 8 December, he defeated Jorge Carpio with 68.4% of the vote. The DCG gained 51 of the 100 seats in Congress and a majority in many municipalities nationwide. He was the first democratically elected president and civilian to take office since 1966. In his inauguration, which was met with great hopes amongst the population, he promised to ensure that what he called the dark forces of the right would not be able to break the public order or the state. He vowed to change Guatemala within his first 126 days. Some of his first actions as president were to force Army Chief of Staff and suspected human rights abuser Rodolfo Lobos Zamora to retire from the military and to name Jaime Hernández Méndez as Minister of Defence, in what was described as a &quot;test of wills&quot; with the Army.

The response was a new wave of terror, with many extrajudicial killings being committed by Guatemalan security forces. This battle against the forces of terror operating in the country was to be the dominant theme of his rule. According to NGO Americas Watch, in 1986, 100 people a month were dying in the conflict at that time. He declared Guatemala neutral in the civil wars that were occurring in neighboring El Salvador and Nicaragua. He was a great supporter of the idea of a Central American Parliament. There were two critical conferences on Central American integration in Esquipulas—the second of which, in August 1987, established the &quot;Procedure for a firm and lasting peace&quot;, the most crucial milestone in re-establishing peace in the region.

On 11 September 1987, he established the National Commission for Reconciliation (CNR), and on 7 October, negotiations between the URNG and the government began. When they failed two days later, with the government refusing to accept the URNG&#x27;s terms, Cerezo asked the United States for more military aid to further the counter-insurgency efforts of the armed forces. On 28 October, Congress passed a general political amnesty. Amidst rumors of plots and possible assassination attempts against Cerezo, many considered him powerless and ineffective. After a farcical attempt by two colonels to take power on 11 May 1988, on 19 May, an Air Force unit made a series of demands on the government, including breaking ties with pro-USSR countries and stopping any contacts with the URNG, as well as more money for better equipment and the removal of many local politicians. Cerezo admitted that he had had to submit to some of the military&#x27;s demands to avoid a coup taking place. In August, there was a three-week general strike in protest against the liberalization of petrol and other fuel sources.

1989 saw a worsening of the political situation, with 1,600 assassinations and 800 kidnappings or disappearances in the first half of the year. These were attributed to the political violence and the covert war between suspected extrajudicial right-wing forces and the URNG. On 9 May, another attempted coup failed, and though the perpetrators were sentenced to long terms in jail that November, they were released on appeal the following January. On 1 August, DCG Secretary General Danilo Barillas was assassinated. However, on 25 August, Cerezo returned with a new promise to renovate the public administration by consolidating democracy within the 500 days he had left as president. Guatemala has remained a democracy ever since.

In May 1990, the Cerezo administration and the URNG signed an important agreement in Madrid that promised not to disturb the forthcoming elections. With this success behind him, Cerezo felt able to give a positive recapitulation of his presidency. He handed power over to his successor, Jorge Serrano, in the first democratic transition of power since 1951. The DCG performed poorly in the presidential elections, with its candidate, Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, not getting past the first round. Despite this, they still managed to win 27 seats in the National Congress.

That same year, as part of a thaw in Soviet–Guatemalan diplomatic relations, Cerezo invited the noted Russian linguist and epigrapher Yuri Knorozov to Guatemala to present him with a medal. Knorozov had been instrumental in the deciphering Maya hieroglyphics, and this was the first opportunity for the scholar to visit the lands and sites of the former Maya civilization.

Then, on 1 December, a troop of soldiers massacred 24 campesinos in Santiago Atitlán in the department of Sololá. In the resulting outcry, the US suspended military aid to Guatemala. Despite having supported the previous coups that led to human rights abuses in the countryside, President Cerezo claims to have stopped the massacre himself.

==Post-presidency==
In 1991, Cerezo became a deputy in the Central American Parliament in its first five-year term. He was accused of hiding behind the immunity conferred here and in his role as an ex-president to avoid a variety of charges, including fraud in the buying of a Jordanian island, the covering up of the murder of Myrna Mack Chang, and the concession of a large piece of land to a conservation group owned by Cerezo&#x27;s son Marco Vinicio Cerezo Blandón.

In the 1999 elections, the unique for which the DCG did not offer a presidential candidate, Cerezo won one of the two National Congress seats gained by his party. He was re-elected to Congress for the 2004-08 period in the November 2003 election, this time as the DCG&#x27;s sole deputy.

In the 2007 general election, Cerezo lost his seat in Congress and his party gained no seats. His son, also named Vinicio Cerezo, ran for president but received less than 1% of the vote.

Vinicio Cerezo is currently building an NGO (nongovernmental organization) named Esquipulas after Esquipulas &quot;Procedure for a firm and lasting peace&quot; and a new Esquipulas conference called Esquipulas III (to follow the previous Esquipulas I and II) to further the integration of Central America, directed by Olinda Salguero. He also is a political consultant.

His appointment as Secretary-General of the Central America Integration System (SICA) was announced on 29 June 2017 during the 49th gathering in San Jose, Costa Rica. He was named Peace Ambassador by the Guatemala Government on 7 August 2017, on the anniversary of the Esquipulas II agreements.
